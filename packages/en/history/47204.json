While\r\nthere has been no previous book on the topic, and none related to it,\r\nsave Mr. C. E. Whitmore's work on _The Supernatural in Tragedy_, the\r\nmass of fiction itself introducing ghostly or psychic motifs is simply\r\nenormous. It is manifestly impossible to discuss, or even to mention,\r\nall of it. Even in my bibliography which numbers over three thousand\r\ntitles, I have made no effort to list all the available examples of\r\nthe type. The bibliography, which I at first intended to publish in\r\nconnection with this volume, is far too voluminous to be included here,\r\nso will probably be brought out later by itself.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible for me to prosecute the research work\r\nor to write the book save for the assistance generously given by many\r\npersons. I am indebted to the various officials of the libraries of\r\nColumbia University and of New York City, particularly to Miss Isadore\r\nMudge, Reference Librarian of Columbia, and to the authorities of\r\nthe New York Society Library for permission to use their priceless\r\nout-of-print novels in the Kennedy Collection. My interest in English\r\nfiction was increased during my attendance on some courses in the\r\nhistory of the English novel, given by Dr. A. J. Carlyle, in Oxford\r\nUniversity, England, several years ago. I have received helpful\r\nbibliographical suggestions from Professor Blanche Colton Williams,\r\nDr. Dorothy Brewster, Professor Nelson Glenn McCrea, Professor John\r\nCunliffe, and Dean Talcott Williams, of Columbia, and Professor G. L.\r\nKittredge, of Harvard. Professors William P. Trent, George Philip\r\nKrapp, and Ernest Hunter Wright very kindly read the book in manuscript\r\nand gave valuable advice concerning it, Professor Wright going over\r\nthe material with me in detail. But my chief debt of gratitude is to\r\nProfessor Ashley H. Thorndike, Head of the Department of English and\r\nComparative Literature in Columbia, whose stimulating criticism and\r\nkindly encouragement have made the book possible. To all of these--and\r\nothers--who have aided me, I am deeply grateful, and I only wish that\r\nthe published volume were more worthy of their assistance.\r\n\r\n      D.

It colors our\r\npoetry, shapes our epics and dramas, and fashions our prose till we are\r\nso wonted to it that we lose sense of its wonder and magic. If all the\r\nelements of the unearthly were removed from our books, how shrunken in\r\nvalue would seem the residue, how forlorn our feelings! Lafcadio Hearn\r\nin the recently published volume, _Interpretations of Literature_, says:\r\n\r\n  There is scarcely any great author in European literature, old\r\n  or new, who has not distinguished himself in his treatment of\r\n  the supernatural. In English literature I believe there is no\r\n  exception from the time of the Anglo-Saxon poets to Shakespeare,\r\n  and from Shakespeare to our own day. And this introduces us to the\r\n  consideration of a general and remarkable fact, a fact that I do\r\n  not remember to have seen in any books, but which is of very great\r\n  philosophical importance: there is something ghostly in all great\r\n  art, whether of literature, music, sculpture, or architecture. It\r\n  touches something within us that relates to infinity.[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] The word _ghostly_ is used here in its earlier sense\r\n      signifying spiritual.\r\n\r\nThis continuing presence of the weird in literature shows the popular\r\ndemand for it and must have some basis in human psychosis. The night\r\nside of the soul attracts us all. The spirit feeds on mystery. It\r\nlives not by fact alone but by the unknowable, and there is no highest\r\nmystery without the supernatural. Man loves the frozen touch of fear,\r\nand realizes pure terror only when touched by the unmortal. The hint\r\nof spectral sounds or presences quickens the imagination as no other\r\nsuggestion can do, and no human shapes of fear can awe the soul as\r\nthose from beyond the grave. Man's varying moods create heaven, hell,\r\nand faery wonder-lands for him, and people them with strange beings.\r\n\r\nMan loves the supernatural elements in literature perhaps because they\r\ndignify him by giving his existence a feeling of infinity otherwise\r\ndenied. They grant him a sense of being the center of powers more than\r\nearthly, of conflicts supermortal. His own material life may be however\r\ncircumscribed and trivial yet he can loose his fancy and escape the\r\npetty tragedies of his days by flight beyond the stars. He can widen\r\nthe tents of his mortal life, create a universe for his companionship,\r\nand marshal the forces of demons and unknown gods for his commands. To\r\nhis narrow rut he can join the unspaced firmament; to his trivial hours\r\nadd eternity; to his finite, infinity. He is so greedy of power, and\r\nhas so piteously little that he must look for his larger life in dreams\r\nand in the literature of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever be the reasons, there has been a continuity of the\r\nghostly in literature, with certain rise and fall of interest. There is\r\nin modern English fiction, as likewise in poetry and the drama, a great\r\nextent of the supernatural, with wide diversity of elements. Beginning\r\nwith the Gothic romance, that curious architectural excrescence that\r\nyet has had enormous influence on our novel, the supernatural is found\r\nin every period and in every form of fiction. The unearthly beings meet\r\nus in all guises, and answer our every mood, whether it be serious or\r\nawed, satiric or humoresque.\r\n\r\nLiterature, always a little ahead of life, has formed our beliefs\r\nfor us, made us free with spirits, and given us entrance to immortal\r\ncountries. The sense of the unearthly is ever with us, even in the\r\nmost commonplace situations,--and there is nothing so natural to\r\nus as the supernatural. Our imagination, colored by our reading,\r\nreveals and transforms the world we live in. We are aware of unbodied\r\nemotions about us, of discarnate moods that mock or invite us. We go\r\na-ghosting now in public places, and a specter may glide up to give us\r\nan _apologia pro vita sua_ any day in Grand Central or on Main Street\r\nof Our-Town. We chat with fetches across the garden fence and pass the\r\ntime of day with demons by way of the dumb-waiter. That gray-furred\r\ncreature that glooms suddenly before us in the winter street is not a\r\nchauffeur, but a were-wolf questing for his prey. Yon whirring thing in\r\nthe far blue is not an aeroplane but a hippogriff that will presently\r\nalight on the pavement beside us with thundering golden hoofs to bear\r\nus away to distant lovely lands where we shall be untroubled by the\r\nprice of butter or the articles lost in last week's wash. That sedate\r\nmiddle-aged ferry that transports us from Staten Island is a magic\r\nSending Boat if only we knew its potent runes! The old woman with\r\nthe too-pink cheeks and glittering eye, that presses August bargains\r\nupon us with the argument that they will be in style for early fall\r\nwear, is a witch wishful to lure away our souls. We may pass at will\r\nby the guardian of the narrow gate and traverse the regions of the\r\nUnder-world. True, the materialist may argue that the actual is more\r\nmarvelous than the imagined, that the aeroplane is more a thing of\r\nwonder than was the hippogriff, that the ferry is really the enchanted\r\nboat, after all, and that Dante would write a new _Inferno_ if he could\r\nsee the subway at the rush hour, but that is another issue.\r\n\r\nWe might have more psychal experiences than we do if we would only\r\nkeep our eyes open, but most of us do have more than we admit to the\r\nneighbors. We have an early-Victorian reticence concerning ghostly\r\nthings as if it were scandalous to be associated with them. But that\r\nis all wrong. We should be proud of being singled out for spectral\r\nconfidences and should report our ghost-guests to the society columns\r\nof the newspaper. It is hoped that this discussion of comparative\r\nghost-lore may help to establish a better sense of values.\r\n\r\nIn this book I deal with ghosts and devils by and large, in an\r\nimpressionistic way. I don't know much about them; I have no learned\r\ntheories of causation. I only love them. I only marvel at their\r\ninfinite variety and am touched by their humanity, their likeness to\r\nmortals. I am fond of them all, even the dejected, dog-eared ghosts\r\nthat look as if they were wraiths of poor relations left out in the\r\nrain all night, or devils whose own mothers wouldn't care for them. It\r\ngives me no holier-than-thou feeling of horror to sit beside a vampire\r\nin the subway, no panic to hear a banshee shut up in a hurdy-gurdy box.\r\nI give a cordial how-do-you-do when a dragon glides up and puts his paw\r\nin mine, and in every stray dog I recognize a Gladsome Beast. Like us\r\nmortals, they all need sympathy, none more so than the poor wizards and\r\nbogles that are on their own, as the Scotch say.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing the nineteenth century as a whole, I have devoted\r\nmore attention to the fiction of the supernatural in the last thirty\r\nyears or so, because there has been much more of it in that time than\r\nbefore. There is now more interest in the occult, more literature\r\nproduced dealing with psychal powers than ever before in our history.\r\nIt is apparent in poetry, in the drama, the novel, and the short\r\nstory. I have not attempted, even in my bibliography, to include all\r\nthe fiction of the type, since that would be manifestly impossible.\r\nI have, however, mentioned specimens of the various forms, and have\r\nlisted the more important examples. The treatment here is meant to\r\nbe suggestive rather than exhaustive and seeks to show that there is\r\na genuine revival of wonder in our time, with certain changes in the\r\ncharacterization of supernatural beings. It includes not only the\r\nthemes that are strictly supernatural, but also those which, formerly\r\nconsidered unearthly, carry on the traditions of the magical. Much of\r\nour material of the weird has been rationalized, yet without losing\r\nits effect of wonder for us in fact or in fiction. If now we study a\r\nscience where once men believed blindly in a Black Art, is the result\r\nreally less mysterious?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe Gothic Romance\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real precursor of supernaturalism in modern English literature\r\nwas the Gothic novel. That odd form might be called a brief in behalf\r\nof banished romance, since it voiced a protest against the excess of\r\nrationalism and realism in the early eighteenth century. Too great\r\ncorrectness and restraint must always result in proportionate liberty.\r\nAs the eternal swing of the pendulum of literary history, the ebb\r\nand flow of fiction inevitably bring a reaction against any extreme,\r\nso it was with the fiction of the period. The mysterious twilights\r\nof medievalism invited eyes tired of the noonday glare of Augustan\r\nformalism. The natural had become familiar to monotony, hence men\r\ncraved the supernatural. And so the Gothic novel came into being.\r\n_Gothic_ is here used to designate the eighteenth-century novel of\r\nterror dealing with medieval materials.\r\n\r\nThere had been some use of the weird in English fiction before Horace\r\nWalpole, but the terror novel proper is generally conceded to begin\r\nwith his Romantic curiosity, _The Castle of Otranto_. The Gothic\r\nnovel marks a distinct change in the form of literature in which\r\nsupernaturalism manifests itself. Heretofore the supernatural elements\r\nhave appeared in the drama, in the epic, in ballads and other poetry,\r\nand in folk-tales, but not noticeably in the novel. Now, however, for\r\na considerable time the ghostly themes are most prominent in lengthy\r\nfiction, contrasted with the short story which later is to supersede it\r\nas a vehicle for the weird. This vacillation of form is a distinct and\r\ninteresting aspect of the development of supernaturalism in literature\r\nand will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nWith this change in form comes a corresponding change in the materials\r\nof ghostly narration. Poetry in general in all times has freely\r\nused the various elements of supernaturalism. The epic has certain\r\ndistinct themes, such as visits to the lower world, visions of\r\nheaven, and conflict between mortal and divine powers, and brings in\r\nmythological characters, gods, goddesses, demigods, and the like. Fate\r\nis a moving figure in the older dramas, while the liturgical plays\r\nintroduced devils, angels, and even the Deity as characters in the\r\naction. In the classical and Elizabethan drama we see ghosts, witches,\r\nmagicians, as _dramatis personæ_. Medieval romances, prose as well as\r\nmetrical and alliterative, _chansons de geste_, _lais_, and so forth,\r\ndrew considerably on the supernatural for complicating material in\r\nvarious forms, and undoubtedly much of our present element comes from\r\nmedievalism. Tales of the Celtic Otherworld, of fairy-lore, of magic,\r\nso popular in early romance, show a strong revival to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic novel is more closely related to the drama than to the epic\r\nor to such poetry as _The Faerie Queene_ or _Comus_. On the other\r\nhand, the later novels and stories, while less influenced by the\r\ndramatic tradition, show more of the epic trace than does the Gothic\r\nromance. The epic tours through heaven and hell, the lavish use of\r\nangels, devils, and even of Deity, the introduction of mythological\r\ncharacters and figures which are not seen in Gothic fiction, appear to\r\na considerable extent in the stories of recent times. In Gothicism we\r\nfind that the Deity disappears though the devil remains. There are no\r\nvampires, so far as I have been able to find, though the were-wolf and\r\nthe lycanthrope appear, which were absent from the drama (save in _The\r\nDuchess of Malfi_). Other elements are seen, such as the beginnings\r\nof the scientific supernaturalism which is to become so prominent in\r\nlater times. The Wandering Jew comes in and the elixir of life and the\r\nphilosopher's stone achieve importance. Mechanical supernaturalism and\r\nthe uncanny power given to inanimate objects seem to have their origins\r\nhere, to be greatly developed further on. Supernaturalism associated\r\nwith animals, related both to the mythological stories of the past and\r\nto the more horrific aspects of later fiction, are noted in the terror\r\nromance.\r\n\r\nAllegory and symbolism are present in a slight degree, as in _Melmoth_\r\nand Vathek's Hall of Eblis, though not emphasized as in more modern\r\nliterature. Humor is largely lacking in the Gothic romance, save as\r\nthe writers furnish it unintentionally. In Gothicism itself we have\r\npractically no satire, though Jane Austen and Barrett satirize the\r\nterror novel itself in delicious burlesques that laugh it out of court.\r\n\r\n=Elements of Gothicism.= In the terror tale the relationship between\r\nsupernatural effect and Gothic architecture, scenery, and weather\r\nis strongly stressed. Everything is ordered to fit the Gothic plan,\r\nand the conformity becomes in time conventionally monotonous. Horace\r\nWalpole, the father of the terror novel, had a fad for medievalism,\r\nand he expressed his enthusiasm in that extraordinary building at\r\nStrawberry Hill, courteously called a Gothic castle. From a study of\r\nGothic architecture was but a step to the writing of romance that\r\nshould reproduce the mysteries of feudal times, for the shadows\r\nof ancient, gloomy castles and cloisters suggested the shades of\r\nghost-haunted fiction, of morbid terrors. _The Castle of Otranto_\r\nwas the outcome of a dream suggested by the author's thinking about\r\nmedieval structures.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic castle itself is represented as possessing all the antique\r\nglooms that increase the effect of mystery and awe, and its secret\r\npassage-ways, its underground vaults and dungeons, its trap-doors,\r\nits mouldy, spectral chapel, form a fit setting for the unearthly\r\nvisitants that haunt it. A feudal hall is the suitable domicile for\r\nghosts and other supernatural revenants, and the horrific romance\r\nthroughout shows a close kinship with its architecture. The novels of\r\nthe class invariably lay their scenes in medieval buildings, a castle,\r\na convent, a monastery, a château or abbey, or an inquisitional prison.\r\nThe harassed heroine is forever wandering through midnight corridors of\r\nGothic structure. And indeed, the opportunity for unearthly phenomena\r\nis much more spacious in the vast piles of antiquity than in our\r\nbungalows or apartment-houses.\r\n\r\nMrs. Radcliffe erected many ruinous structures in fiction. Her\r\n_Mysteries of Udolpho_ shows a castle, a convent, a château, all Gothic\r\nin terror and gloomy secrets, with rooms hung with rotting tapestry,\r\nor wainscoted with black larch-wood, with furniture dust-covered and\r\ndropping to pieces from age, with palls of black velvet waving in the\r\nghostly winds. In other romances she depicts decaying castles with\r\ntreacherous stairways leading to mysterious rooms, halls of black\r\nmarble, and vaults whose great rusty keys groan in the locks. One\r\nheroine says:[2] \"When I entered the portals of this Gothic structure a\r\nchill--surely prophetic--chilled my veins, pressed upon my heart, and\r\nscarcely allowed me to breathe.\"\r\n\r\n      [2] In _The Romance of the Castle_.\r\n\r\n_The Ancient Records of the Abbey of St. Oswyth_[3] says of its\r\nsetting: \"The damp, cold, awe-inspiring hall seemed to conjure up ten\r\nthousand superstitious horrors and terrific imaginary apparitions.\" In\r\nMaturin's _Albigenses_ the knights assemble round the great fire in\r\nthe baronial hall and tell ghost tales while the storm rages outside.\r\nIn _Melmoth, the Wanderer_ the scene changes often, yet it is always\r\nGothic and terrible,--the monastery with its diabolical punishments,\r\nthe ancient castle, the ruined abbey by which the wanderer celebrates\r\nhis marriage at midnight with a dead priest for the celebrant, the\r\nmadhouse, the inquisition cells, which add gloom and horror to the\r\nsupernatural incidents and characters. In _Zofloya_,[4] the maiden is\r\nimprisoned in an underground cave similar to that boasted by other\r\ncastles. This novel is significant because of the freedom with which\r\nShelley appropriated its material for his _Zastrozzi_, which likewise\r\nhas the true Gothic setting. In Shelley's other romance he erects the\r\nsame structure and has the devil meet his victim by the desolate, dear\r\nold Gothic abbey.\r\n\r\n      [3] By T. J. Horsley-Curties.\r\n\r\n      [4] By Mrs. Dacre, better known as \"Rosa Matilda.\"\r\n\r\nRegina Maria Roche wrote a number of novels built up with crumbling\r\ncastles, awesome abbeys, and donjon-keeps whose titles show the\r\narchitectural fiction that dominates them. A list of the names of the\r\nGothic novels will serve to show the general importance laid on antique\r\nsetting. In fact, the castle, abbey, monastery, château, convent,\r\nor inquisition prison occupied such an important place in the story\r\nthat it seemed the leading character. It dominated the events and was\r\na malignant personality, that laid its spell upon those within its\r\nbounds. It shows something of the character that Hawthorne finally\r\ngives to his house of seven gables, or the brooding, relentless power\r\nof the sea in Synge's drama.[5] The ancient castle becomes not merely\r\nhaunted itself but is the haunter as well.\r\n\r\n      [5] _Riders to the Sea._\r\n\r\nNot only is architecture made subservient to the needs of Gothic\r\nfiction, but the scenery likewise is adapted to fit it. Before Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe wrote her stories interlarded with nature descriptions,\r\nscant notice had been paid to scenery in the novel. But she set the\r\nstyle for morose landscapes as Walpole had for glooming castles, and\r\nthe succeeding romances of the _genre_ combined both features. Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe was not at all hampered by the fact that she had never laid\r\neyes on the scenes she so vividly pictures. She painted the dread\r\nscenery of awesome mountains and forests, beetling crags and dizzy\r\nabysses with fluent and fervent adjectives, and her successors imitated\r\nher in sketching nature with dark impressionism.\r\n\r\nThe scenery in general in the Gothic novel is always subjectively\r\nrepresented. Nature in itself and of itself is not the important\r\nthing. What the writer seeks to do is by descriptions of the outer\r\nworld to emphasize the mental states of man, to reflect the moods of\r\nthe characters, and to show a fitting background for their crimes and\r\nunearthly experiences. There is little of the light of day, of the\r\ncheerfulness of ordinary nature, but only the scenes and phenomena that\r\nare in harmony with the glooms of crimes and sufferings.\r\n\r\nLike the scenery, the weather in the Gothic novel is always\r\nsubjectively treated. There is ever an artistic harmony between\r\nman's moods and the atmospheric conditions. The play of lightning,\r\nsupernatural thunders, roaring tempests announce the approach and\r\noperations of the devil, and ghosts walk to the accompaniment of\r\npresaging tempests. In _The Albigenses_ the winds are diabolically\r\npossessed and laugh fiendishly instead of moaning as they do as\r\nseneschals in most romances of terror. The storms usually take place\r\nat midnight, and there is rarely a peaceful night in Gothic fiction.\r\nThe stroke of twelve generally witnesses some uproar of nature as\r\nsome appearance of restless spirit. Whenever the heroines in Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe's tales start on their midnight ramble through subterranean\r\npassages and halls of horror, the barometer becomes agitated. And\r\nanother[6] says: \"The storm, that at that moment was tremendous, could\r\nnot equal that tempest which passed in the thoughts of the unhappy\r\ncaptive.\"\r\n\r\n      [6] St. Oswyth.\r\n\r\nIn _Zofloya_ Victoria's meetings in the forest with the Moor, who\r\nis really the devil in disguise, are accompanied by supernatural\r\nmanifestations of nature. The weather is ordered to suit the dark,\r\nunholy plots they make, and they plan murders against a background\r\nof black clouds, hellish thunder, and lurid lightning. When at last\r\nthe Moor announces himself as the devil and hurls Victoria from the\r\nmountain top, a sympathetic storm arises and a flood sweeps her body\r\ninto the river. This scene is accusingly like the one in the last\r\nchapter of Lewis's _Monk_, where the devil throws Ambrosio from the\r\ncliff to the river's brink.\r\n\r\n  Instantly a violent storm arose; the winds in fury rent up rocks\r\n  and forests; the sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with\r\n  fire; the rain fell in torrents; it swelled the stream, the waves\r\n  over-flowed their banks; they reached the spot where Ambrosio lay,\r\n  and, when they abated, carried with them into the river the corse\r\n  of the despairing monk.\r\n\r\nNo Gothic writer shows more power of harmonizing the tempests of the\r\nsoul with the outer storms than does Charles Robert Maturin.[7] As\r\nMelmoth, doomed to dreadful life till he can find some tortured soul\r\nwilling to exchange destinies with him, traverses the earth in his\r\nsearch, the preternatural aspects of weather both reflect and mock\r\nhis despair. As the young nephew alone at midnight after his uncle's\r\ndeath reads the fated manuscript, \"cloud after cloud comes sweeping\r\non like the dark banners of an approaching host whose march is for\r\ndestruction.\" Other references may illustrate the motif. \"Clouds go\r\nportentously off like ships of war ... to return with added strength\r\nand fury.\" \"The dark and heavy thunder-clouds that advance slowly seem\r\nlike the shrouds of specters of departed greatness. Peals of thunder\r\nsounded, every peal like the exhausted murmurs of a spent heart.\"\r\n\r\n      [7] In _Melmoth, the Wanderer_ and _The Albigenses_.\r\n\r\nIn general, in the Gothic novel there is a decided and definite attempt\r\nto use the terrible forces of nature to reflect the dark passions of\r\nman, with added suggestiveness where supernatural agencies are at work\r\nin the events. This becomes a distinct convention, used with varying\r\neffectiveness. Nowhere in the fiction of the period is there the power\r\nsuch as Shakespeare reveals, as where Lear wanders on the heath in\r\nthe pitiless clutch of the storm, with a more tragic tempest in his\r\nsoul. Yet, although the idea of the inter-relation of the passions of\r\nman and nature is not original with the Gothicists, and though they\r\nshow little of the inevitability of genius, they add greatly to their\r\nsupernatural effect by this method. Later fiction is less barometric as\r\nless architectural than the Gothic.\r\n\r\n=The Origin of Individual Gothic Tales.= The psychological origin of\r\nthe individual Gothic romances is interesting to note. Supernaturalism\r\nwas probably more generally believed in then than now, and people were\r\nmore given to the telling of ghost stories and all the folk-tales of\r\nterror than at the present time. One reason for this may be that they\r\nhad more leisure; and their great open fires were more conducive to the\r\nretailing of romances of shudders than our unsocial steam radiators.\r\nThe eighteenth century seemed frankly to enjoy the pleasures of fear,\r\nand the rise of the Gothic novel gave rein to this natural love for the\r\nuncanny and the gruesome.\r\n\r\nDreams played an important part in the inspiration of the tales of\r\nterror. The initial romance was, as the author tells us, the result of\r\nan architectural nightmare. Walpole says in a letter:\r\n\r\n  Shall I even confess to you what was the origin of this romance? I\r\n  waked one morning from a dream, of which all that I could recall\r\n  was that I had thought myself in an ancient castle (a very natural\r\n  dream for a head filled like mine with Gothic story) and that at\r\n  the uppermost banister of a great staircase I saw a gigantic hand\r\n  in armor. In the evening I sat down and began to write, without\r\n  knowing in the least what I intended to say or relate. The work\r\n  grew on my hands.\r\n\r\nMary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ was likewise born of a dream. \"Monk\"\r\nLewis had interested Byron, Polidori, and the Shelleys in supernatural\r\ntales so much so that after a fireside recital of German terror stories\r\nByron proposed that each member of the group should write a ghostly\r\nromance to be compared with the compositions of the others. The results\r\nwere negligible save _Frankenstein_, and it is said that Byron was much\r\nannoyed that a mere girl should excel him. At first Mrs. Shelley was\r\nunable to hit upon a plot, but one evening after hearing a discussion\r\nof Erasmus Darwin's attempts to create life by laboratory experiments,\r\nshe had an idea in a half waking dream. She says:\r\n\r\n  I saw--with shut eyes but acute mental vision--I saw the pale\r\n  student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put\r\n  together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out,\r\n  and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of\r\n  life.... The artist sleeps but he is awakened; and behold, the\r\n  horrid thing stands at his bedside, looking on him with watery,\r\n  yellow yet speculative eyes!\r\n\r\nAnd from this she wrote her story of the man-monster.\r\n\r\nThe relation of dreams to the uncanny tale is interesting. Dreams\r\nand visions, revelatory of the past and prophetic of the future,\r\nplayed an important part in the drama (as they are now widely used in\r\nmotion-picture scenarios) and the Gothic novel continues the tradition.\r\nIt would be impossible to discover in how many instances the authors\r\nwere subconsciously influenced in their choice of material by dreams.\r\nThe presaging dreams and visions attributed to supernatural agency\r\nappear frequently in Gothic fiction. The close relation between dreams\r\nand second sight in the terror novel might form an interesting by-path\r\nfor investigation. Dream-supernaturalism becomes even more prominent in\r\nlater fiction and contributes passages of extraordinary power of which\r\nDe Quincey's _Dream-Fugue_ may be mentioned as an example.\r\n\r\nThe germinal idea for _Melmoth, the Wanderer_ was contained in a\r\nparagraph from one of the author's own sermons, which suggested a theme\r\nfor the story of a doomed, fate-pursued soul.\r\n\r\n  At this moment is there one of us present, however we may have\r\n  departed from the Lord, disobeyed His will, and disregarded His\r\n  word--is there one of us who would, at this moment, accept all that\r\n  man could bestow or earth could afford, to resign the hope of his\r\n  salvation? No, there is not one--not such a fool on earth were the\r\n  enemy of mankind to traverse it with the offer!\r\n\r\nTrue, the theme of such devil-pact had appeared in folk-tales and\r\nin the drama previously, notably in Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_, but\r\nMaturin here gives the idea a dramatic twist and psychologic poignancy\r\nby making a human being the one to seek to buy another's soul to save\r\nhis own. A mortal, cursed with physical immortality, ceaselessly\r\nharried across the world by the hounds of fate, forever forced by an\r\nirresistible urge to make his impitiable offer to tormented souls, and\r\nalways meeting a tragic refusal, offers dramatic possibilities of a\r\nhigh order and Maturin's story has a dreadful power.\r\n\r\nClara Reeve's avowed purpose in writing _The Old English Baron_ was to\r\nproduce a ghost story that should be more probable and realistic than\r\nWalpole's. She stated that her book was the literary offspring of the\r\nearlier romance, though Walpole disclaimed the paternity. She deplored\r\nthe violence of the supernatural machinery that tended to defeat its\r\nown impressiveness and wished to avoid that danger in her work, though\r\nshe announced: \"We can conceive and allow for the appearance of a\r\nghost.\" Her prim recipe for Romantic fiction required, \"a certain\r\ndegree of the marvelous to excite the attention; enough of the manners\r\nof real life to give an air of probability to the work; and enough of\r\nthe pathetic to engage the heart in its behalf.\" But her ingredients\r\ndid not mix well and the result was rather indigestible though devoured\r\nby hungry readers of her time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anne Radcliffe, that energetic manipulator of Gothic enginery,\r\nwrote because she had time that was wasting on her hands,--which may be\r\nan explanation for other and later literary attempts. Her journalist\r\nhusband was away till late at night, so while sitting up for him she\r\nwrote frightful stories to keep herself from being scared. During that\r\nwaiting loneliness she doubtless experienced all those nervous terrors\r\nthat she describes as being undergone by her palpitating maidens,\r\nwhose emotional anguish is suffered in midnight wanderings through\r\nsubterranean passages and ghosted apartments. There is one report that\r\nshe went mad from over-much brooding on mormo, but that is generally\r\ndiscredited.\r\n\r\nMatthew Gregory Lewis was impelled to write _The Monk_ by reading\r\nthe romances of Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe, together with Schiller's\r\n_Robbers_, which triple influence is discernible in his lurid tale.\r\nHe defended the indecency of his book by asserting that he took the\r\nplot from a story in _The Guardian_,[8] ingeniously intimating that\r\nplagiarized immorality is less reprehensible than original material.\r\nShelley, in his turn, was so strongly impressed by Lewis's _Monk_,\r\nand Mrs. Dacre's _Zofloya_ in writing his _Zastrozzi_, and by William\r\nGodwin's _St. Leon_ in his _St. Irvyne, or The Rosicrucian_, that\r\nthe adaptation amounts to actual plagiarism. Even the titles show\r\nimitation. In writing to Godwin, Shelley said he was \"in a state of\r\nintellectual sickness\" when he wrote these stories, and no one who is\r\nfamiliar with the productions will contradict him in the matter.\r\n\r\n      [8] \"The History of Santon Barsis,\" _The Guardian_, Number 148.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the crude scientific thought and investigation of the\r\neighteenth century is apparent in the Gothic novels. _Frankenstein_,\r\nas we have seen, was the outcome of a Romantic, Darwinian dream, and\r\nnovels by Godwin, Shelley, and Maturin deal with the theme of the\r\nelixir of life. William Beckford's _Vathek_ has to do with alchemy,\r\nsorcery, and other phases of supernatural science. Zofloya, Mrs.\r\nDacre's diabolical Moor, performs experiments in hypnotism, telepathy,\r\nsorcery, and satanic chemistry. And so in a number of the imitative and\r\nless known novels of the _genre_ science plays a part in furnishing\r\nthe material. There is much interest in the study of the relation of\r\nscience to the literature of supernaturalism in the various periods and\r\nthe discoveries of modern times as furnishing plot material. The Gothic\r\ncontribution to this form of ghostly fiction is significant, though\r\nslight in comparison with later developments.\r\n\r\n=The Gothic Ghosts.= The Ghost is the real hero or heroine of the\r\nGothic novel. The merely human characters become for the reader\r\ncolorless and dull the moment a specter glides up and indicates a\r\nwillingness to relate the story of his life. The continuing popularity\r\nof the shade in literature may be due to the fact that humanity finds\r\nfear one of the most pleasurable of emotions and truly enjoys vicarious\r\nhorrors, or it may be due to a childish delight in the sensational.\r\nAt all events, the ghost haunts the pages of terror fiction, and\r\nthe trail of the supernatural is over them all. In addition to its\r\nassociation with ancient superstitions, survivals of animistic ideas in\r\nprimitive culture, we may see the classical and Elizabethan influence\r\nin the Gothic specter. The prologue-ghost, naturally, is not needed\r\nin fiction, but the revenge-ghost is as prominent as ever. The ghost\r\nas a dramatic personage, his talkativeness, his share in the action,\r\nreflect the dramatic tradition, with a strong Senecan touch. The Gothic\r\nphantoms have not the power of Shakespeare's apparitions, nothing\r\napproaching the psychologic subtlety of _Hamlet_ or _Julius Cæsar_\r\nor the horrific suggestiveness of _Macbeth_, yet they are related to\r\nthem and are not altogether poor. Though imitative of the dramatic\r\nghosts they have certain characteristics peculiar to themselves and are\r\ngreatly worth consideration in a study of literary supernaturalism.\r\n\r\nThere are several clearly marked classes of ghosts in Gothicism. There\r\nis the real ghost that anybody can pin faith to; there is the imagined\r\napparition that is only a figment of hysterical fear or of a guilty\r\nconscience; and there is the deliberate hoax specter. There are ghosts\r\nthat come only when called,--sometimes the castle dungeons have to be\r\npaged for retiring shades; others appear of their own free will. Some\r\nhave a local habitation and a name and haunt only their own proper\r\npremises, while others have the wanderlust. There are innocent spirits\r\nreturning to reveal the circumstances of their violent demise and to\r\nask Christian burial; we meet guilty souls sent back to do penance for\r\ntheir sins in the place of their commission; and there are revenge\r\nghosts of multiple variety. There are specters that yield to prayers\r\nand strong-minded shades that resist exorcism. It is difficult to\r\nclassify them, for the lines cross inextricably.\r\n\r\nThe genealogical founder of the family of Gothic ghosts is the giant\r\napparition in _The Castle of Otranto_. He heralds his coming by an\r\nenormous helmet, a hundred times larger than life size, which crashes\r\ninto the hall, and a sword which requires a hundred men to bear it in.\r\nThe ghost himself appears in sections. We first see a Brobdignagian\r\nfoot and leg, with no body, then a few chapters later an enormous hand\r\nto match. In the last scene he assembles his parts, after the fashion\r\nof an automobile demonstration, supplies the limbs that are lacking\r\nand stands forth as an imposing and portentous shade. After receiving\r\nAlfonso's specter--Alfonso will be remembered as the famous statue\r\nafflicted with the nose-bleed--he \"is wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze\r\nof glory.\" That seems singular, considering the weighty material of\r\nwhich he and his armor are made. There is another interesting specter\r\nin the castle, the monk who is seen kneeling in prayer in the gloomy\r\nchapel and who, \"turning slowly round discovers to Frederick the\r\nfleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton wrapped in a hermit's\r\ncowl.\"\r\n\r\nClara Reeve's young peasant in _The Old English Baron_, the\r\nunrecognized heir to the estate, who is spending a night in the\r\nhaunted apartment, sees two apparitions, one a woman and the other a\r\ngentleman in armor though not of such appalling size as the revenant\r\nin _Otranto_. The two announce themselves as his long-lost parents\r\nand vanish after he is estated and suitably wed. Mrs. Radcliffe[9]\r\nintroduces the shade of a murdered knight, a chatty personage who\r\nhaunts a baronial hall full of men, and at another time engages in a\r\ntournament, slaying his opponent.\r\n\r\n      [9] In _Gaston de Blondeville_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bonhote[10] shows us a migratory ghost of whom the old servant\r\ncomplains in vexation:\r\n\r\n  Only think, Miss, of a ghost that should be at home minding its\r\n  own business at the Baron's own castle, taking the trouble to\r\n  follow him here on special business it has to communicate! However,\r\n  travelling three or four hundred miles is nothing to a ghost that\r\n  can, as I have heard, go at the rate of a thousand miles a minute\r\n  on land or sea.\r\n\r\nIn this romance the baron goes to visit the vault and has curdling\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n      [10] In _Bungay Castle_.\r\n\r\n\"A deep groan issues from the coffin and a voice exclaims, 'You hurt\r\nme! Forbear or you will crush my bones to powder!'\" He knocks the\r\ncoffin in pieces, whereupon the vocal bones demand decent burial and\r\nhis departure from the castle. Later the baron sees the ghost of his\r\nfirst wife, who objects to his making a third matrimonial venture,\r\nthough she has apparently conceded the second. In the same story a\r\nyoung woman's spook pursues one Thomas, almost stamping on his heels,\r\nand finally vanishing like a sky-rocket, leaving an odor of brimstone\r\nbehind. A specter rises from a well in _The History of Jack Smith, or\r\nthe Castle of Saint Donats_,[11] and shakes its hoary head at a group\r\nof men who fire pistols at it.\r\n\r\n      [11] By Charles Lucas, Baltimore.\r\n\r\n_The Castle of Caithness_[12] shows a murdered father indicating his\r\nwounds to his son and demanding vengeance. An armored revenge ghost\r\nappears in _Count Roderick's Castle_, or _Gothic Times_, an anonymous\r\nPhiladelphia novel, telling his son the manner of his murder, and\r\nscaring the king, who has killed him, to madness. The revenge ghosts in\r\nthe Gothic do not cry \"Vindicta!\" as frequently as in the early drama,\r\nbut they are as relentless in their hate. In _Ancient Records_, or _The\r\nAbbey of St. Oswyth_,[13] the spirit of a nun who has been wronged\r\nand buried alive by the wicked baron returns with silent, tormenting\r\nreproach. She stands beside him at midnight, with her dead infant on\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly the eyes of the specter become animated. Oh!--then what\r\n  flashes of appalling anger dart from their hollow orbits on the\r\n  horror-stricken Vortimer! Three dreadful shrieks ring pealing\r\n  through the chamber now filled with a blaze of sulphurous light.\r\n  The specter suddenly becomes invisible and the baron falls\r\n  senseless on his couch.\r\n\r\nScant wonder! In the same story Rosaline, the distressed heroine, is\r\nabout to wed against her will, when a specter appears and forbids the\r\nbans. Again, Gondemar has a dagger at her throat with wicked intent,\r\nwhen a spook \"lifts up his hollow, sunken countenance and beckons with\r\nangry gestures for his departure.\" Gondemar departs!\r\n\r\n      [12] By F. H. P.\r\n\r\n      [13] By T. J. Horsley-Curties.\r\n\r\nAnother revenge ghost creates excitement in _The Accusing Spirit_. A\r\nmurdered marquis appears repeatedly to interested parties and demands\r\npunishment on his brother who has slain him. Another inconsiderate\r\nspecter in the same volume wakes a man from his sleep, and beckoning\r\nhim to follow, leads him to a subterranean vault, stamps his foot on\r\na certain stone, shows a ghastly wound in his throat and vanishes. On\r\ninvestigation, searchers find a corpse in a winding-sheet beneath the\r\nindicated spot. Another accusing spirit appears in the same story--that\r\nof Benedicta, a recreant nun, who glides as a headless and mutilated\r\nfigure through the cloisters and hovers over the convent bed where\r\nshe \"breathed out her guilty soul.\" The young heroine who has taken\r\ntemporary refuge in the convent and has to share the cell with this\r\ndisturbing room-mate, is informed by an old nun that, \"Those damned\r\nspirits who for mysterious purposes receive permission to wander over\r\nthe earth can possess no power to injure us but that which they may\r\nderive from the weakness of our imagination.\" Nevertheless, the nervous\r\ngirl insists on changing her room! Another famous cloistered ghost,\r\none of the pioneer female apparitions of note, is the Bleeding Nun\r\nin Lewis's _The Monk_, that hall of Gothic horrors. He provides an\r\nunderstudy for her, who impersonates the nun in times of emergency,\r\nproviding complicating confusion for the other characters and for the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nGhosts begin to crowd upon each others' heels in later Gothic novels.\r\nNo romance is so poor as not to have a retinue of specters, or at\r\nleast, a ghost-of-all-work. Emboldened by their success as individuals,\r\nspooks appear in groups and mobs. William Beckford in his _Vathek_\r\npresents two thousand specters in one assembly. Beckford was no\r\nniggard! In Maturin's _The Albigenses_, de Montfort, passing alone\r\nthrough a dark forest, meets the phantoms of countless victims of his\r\nreligious persecution. Men, women, young maidens, babes at the breast,\r\nall move toward him with unspeakable reproach, with \"clattering bones,\r\neyeless sockets, bare and grinning jaws.\" Aside from Dante the most\r\nimpressive description of unhappy spirits in a large number is given\r\nin _Vathek_ in that immortal picture of the Hall of Eblis. Beckford\r\nshows here a concourse of doomed souls, each with his hand forever\r\npressed above his burning heart, each carrying his own hell within him,\r\nhaving lost heaven's most precious boon, the soul's hope! In the Hall\r\nof Eblis there are the still living corpses, \"the fleshless forms of\r\nthe pre-adamite kings, who still possess enough life to be conscious\r\nof their deplorable condition; they regard one another with looks of\r\nthe deepest dejection, each holding his right hand motionless above his\r\nheart.\" The prophet Soliman is there, from whose livid lips come tragic\r\nwords of his sin and punishment. Through his breast, transparent as\r\nglass, the beholder can see his heart enveloped in flames.\r\n\r\nIn James Hogg's _The Wool-Gatherer_, a man of very evil life is haunted\r\nby the wraiths of those he has wronged. As he lies on his death-bed,\r\nnot only he, but those around him as well, hear the pleading voices of\r\nwomen, the pitiful cries of babes around his bed, though nothing is\r\nvisible. We have here a suggestion of the invisible supernaturalism\r\nthat becomes so frequent and effective a motif in later fiction. After\r\nthe man is dead, the supernatural sounds become so dreadful that \"the\r\ncorpse sits up in the bed, pawls wi' its hands and stares round wi' its\r\ndead face!\" When the watchers leave the room for a few moments, the\r\nbody mysteriously disappears and is never found. A somewhat similar\r\ninstance occurs in one of Ambrose Bierce's modern stories of dead\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThere is some attempt to exorcise restless spirits in a number of\r\nGothic novels. On various occasions the priests come forth with\r\nbell, book, and candle to pronounce anathema against the troublesome\r\nvisitants. In one story a monk crosses his legs to scare away the\r\nspecter, but forgets and presently tumbles over. In another,[14] the\r\npriest peremptorily bids the ghosts depart and breaks the news firmly\r\nto them that they cannot return for a thousand years. But one bogle,\r\nwhether of feeble understanding or strong will, comes in to break up\r\nthe ceremonies of incantation, and scares the priest into hysterics.\r\n\r\n      [14] _The Spirit of Turrettville._\r\n\r\nThe imagined ghost appears in many of the Gothic tales, whose writers\r\nlack the courage of their supernaturalism. Mrs. Radcliffe, for\r\ninstance, loves to build up a tissue of ghostly horrors, yet explains\r\nthem away on natural grounds after the reader fancies he sees a spirit\r\naround every corner.\r\n\r\nThe ghosts that are deliberately got up for the purposes of deception\r\nform an interesting feature of Gothic methods. The reasons behind\r\nthe spectral impersonations are various, to frighten criminals into\r\nrestitution after confession, to further crime, or merely to enliven\r\nthe otherwise lagging story. In _The Spirit of Turrettville_ two youths\r\nfollow the sounds of plaintive music till, in a deserted, spookish\r\napartment, they see a woman playing at an old harp. As they draw near,\r\nthey see only skeleton hands on the keys and the apparition turns\r\ntoward them \"a grinning, mouldering skull.\" She waves her hands with\r\nhaughty rebuke for their intrusion and \"stalks\" out of the oratory. She\r\ngives further performances, however, singing a song composed for the\r\noccasion. But the reader, after such thrills, resents finding out later\r\nthat she is the living wife, attempting to frighten the villain into\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nIn _The Accusing Spirit_ a bogus spook is constructed by means of\r\nphosphorus, aided by a strong resemblance between two men, to accuse\r\nan innocent man of murder. The apparition dramatically makes his\r\ncharge, but is unmasked just in time to save the victim's life. A tall,\r\ncadaverous young man makes up for a ghost in an anonymous novel,[15]\r\nwhile a mysterious woman in a black veil attends a midnight funeral in\r\nthe castle, then unaccountably disappears.\r\n\r\n      [15] In _Ariel, or the Invisible Monitor_.\r\n\r\nIn _Melmoth_ the monks persecute a despised brother by impersonating\r\nspirits in his cell. They cover the walls with images of fiends, over\r\nwhich they smear phosphorus, and burn sulphur to assist the deception.\r\nThey utter mocking cries as of demons, seeking to drive him mad. In\r\nLewis's _Monk_ there is a false Bleeding Nun as well as the _bona\r\nfide_ specter. In other Gothic novels there are various spectral frauds\r\ncleverly planned, and then revealed, but their explanation does not\r\naltogether dispel the uncanny impression they make.\r\n\r\nThe ghost that stays at home in a definite place, haunting its own\r\ndemesne, is a familiar figure in the fiction of the period. Every\r\ncastle has its haunted tower or dungeon or apartment with its shade\r\nthat walks by night. Several appear carrying candles or lamps to\r\nlight them through the blackness of architectural labyrinths. Several\r\nevince a fondness for bells and herald their coming by rings. In one\r\nromance,[16] the ghost takes the form of a white cow. (Doubtless many\r\nghosts in real life have had a similar origin.) In another,[17] a\r\nspecter in armor appears to terrify his murderer, and supernatural\r\nlightning aids in his revenge.\r\n\r\n      [16] _The Spirit of the Castle._\r\n\r\n      [17] _Ethelwina, or the House of Fitz-Auburne_, by T. J.\r\n      Horsley-Curties.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to designate all the ghosts in Gothic fiction\r\nfor there is wholesale haunting. They appear in the plot to warn, to\r\ncomfort or command, and seem to have very human characteristics on the\r\nwhole. Yet they are not so definitely personated, not so individual and\r\nrealistic as the spirits in later fiction, though they do achieve some\r\ncreepy effects. It is not their brute force that impresses us. We are\r\nless moved by the armored knight and the titanic adversary in Otranto\r\nthan by the phantoms in the Hall of Eblis. The vindictive ghosts,\r\nmouldy from the vault, are less appalling than the bodiless voices of\r\nwronged women and children that haunt the death-bed and bring a corpse\r\nback to dreadful life. The specters with flamboyant personality, that\r\noppress us with their egotistic clamor, may be soon forgotten, but the\r\nghostly suggestiveness of other spirits has a haunting power that is\r\ninescapable. Some of the Gothic ghosts have a strange vitality,--and,\r\nafter all, where would be the phantoms of to-day but for their early\r\nservices?\r\n\r\n=Witches and Warlocks.= While not at all equal in importance to the\r\nghosts, witches and warlocks add to the excitement in Gothic fiction.\r\nThere is but little change from the witch of dramatic tradition, for\r\nwe have both the real and the reputed witch in the terror novel, the\r\ngenuine antique hag who has powers given her from the devil, and the\r\nbeautiful young girl who is wrongly suspected of an unholy alliance\r\nwith the dark spirits.\r\n\r\nIn _Melmoth_, there is an old woman doctor who has uncanny ability.\r\nShe tells fortunes, gives spells against the evil eye and produces\r\nweird results \"by spells and such dandy as is beyond our element.\"\r\nShe turns the mystic yarn to be dropped into the pit, on the brink of\r\nwhich stands \"the shivering inquirer into futurity, doubtful whether\r\nthe answer to her question 'Who holds?' is to be uttered by the\r\nvoice of a demon or lover.\" In _The Albigenses_ three Weird Sisters\r\nappear that are not altogether poor imitations of Shakespeare's own.\r\nMatilda in _The Monk_ possesses dæmonic power of enchantment and in\r\nthe subterranean passages of the monastery she works her unhallowed\r\narts. The hag Carathis, in _Vathek_, is a witch of rare skill, who\r\nconcocts her magic potions and by supernatural means forces all things\r\nto her will. There are several witches and warlocks in James Hogg's\r\n_The Hunt of Eildon_, who work much mischief but at last are captured\r\nand convicted. They have the choice of being burned alive or being\r\nbaptized, but with wild cries they struggle against the holy water and\r\nface the flames.\r\n\r\nIn Hogg's _Brownie of Bodbeck_, Marion Linton believes her own daughter\r\nis a witch and thinks she should be given the trial by fire or water.\r\nThere is an innocent young reputed witch in _The Hunt of Eildon_, who\r\nis sentenced to death for her art.\r\n\r\n=The Devil.= The devil incarnate is one of the familiar figures in the\r\nterror novel. Here, as in the case of the ghost, we see the influence\r\nof the dramatic rather than of the epic tradition. He is akin to\r\nCalderon's wonder-working magician and Marlowe's Dr. Faustus rather\r\nthan to the satanic creations of Dante and Milton. He is not a dread,\r\nawe-inspiring figure either physically or as a personality, though he\r\ndoes assume terrifying, almost epic proportions in the closing scenes\r\nof _The Monk_ and _Zofloya_. Neither is he as human, as appealing to\r\nour sympathies as the lonely, misjudged, misunderstood devils in later\r\nfiction. We neither love nor greatly fear the Gothic demon. Yet he does\r\nappear in interesting variants and deserves our study.\r\n\r\nIn Hogg's _Hunt of Eildon_ the devil comes in as a strange old man who\r\nyet seems curiously familiar to the king and to everyone who sees him,\r\nthough no one can remember just when he knew him. There is a clever\r\npsychologic suggestiveness here, which perhaps inspired a similar idea\r\nin a recent play, _The Eternal Magdalen_. Later he is recognized and\r\nholy water thrown on him.\r\n\r\n  The whole form and visage of the creature was changed in a moment\r\n  to that of a furious fiend. He uttered a yell that made all the\r\n  abbey shake to its foundations and forthwith darted away into the\r\n  air, wrapt in flames. As he ascended, he waved his right hand and\r\n  shook his fiery locks at his inquisitors.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing dubious about his personality here, certainly!\r\n\r\nSatan appears dramatically in _The Monk_ as well. His first visits\r\nare made in the form of attractive youth. Ambrosio, who has been led\r\ninto sin by the dæmonic agent, Matilda, is awaiting death in the\r\nInquisition cell, when she comes to see him to urge that he win release\r\nby selling his soul to the devil. But the repentant monk refuses her\r\nadvice, so she departs in a temper of blue flame. Then he has a more\r\ndread visitant,--Lucifer himself, described as follows:\r\n\r\n  His blasted limbs still bore the marks of the Almighty's thunders;\r\n  a swarthy darkness spread itself over his gigantic form; his hands\r\n  and feet were armed with long talons.... Over his huge shoulders\r\n  waved two enormous sable wings; and his hair was supplied by living\r\n  snakes which twined themselves with frightful hissings. In one hand\r\n  he held a roll of parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still\r\n  the lightnings flashed around him and the thunder bursts seemed to\r\n  announce the dissolution of nature.\r\n\r\nAmbrosio is overawed into selling his soul and signs the compact with\r\nhis blood, as per convention.\r\n\r\nThe devil doesn't keep to his agreement to release him, however, for\r\nLewis tells us that taking his victim to the top of a mountain and\r\n\"darting his talons into the monk's shaven crown, he sprang with him\r\nfrom the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks.\r\nThe demon continued to soar aloft till, reaching a dreadful height,\r\nhe released the sufferer. Headlong fell the monk.\" He plunges to the\r\nriver's brink, after which a storm is evoked by the devil and his body\r\nswept away in the flood.\r\n\r\nA similar dæmonic manifestation occurs in _Zofloya_. Victoria has been\r\ninduced to bind herself to the Evil One, who has appeared as a Moorish\r\nservant of impressive personality and special powers. He grants her\r\nwishes hostile to her enemies, holding many conferences with her in\r\nthe dark forest where he is heralded by flute-like sounds. He appears\r\nsometimes like a flame, sometimes like a lightning flash. He comes with\r\nthe swiftness of the wind and tells her that her thoughts summoned\r\nhim. At last, he announces himself as Satan, and assumes his own\r\nhideous form of gigantism.\r\n\r\n  Behold me as I am, no longer that which I appeared to be, but the\r\n  sworn enemy of all created nature, by men called Satan. Yes, it was\r\n  I that under semblance of the Moor appeared to thee.\r\n\r\n  As he spoke, he grasped more firmly the neck of Victoria, with one\r\n  push he whirled her headlong down the dreadful abyss!--as she fell\r\n  his loud dæmonic laugh, his yells of triumph echoed in her ears;\r\n  and a mangled corpse she fell, she was received into the foaming\r\n  waters below.\r\n\r\nThe devil is seen in _Vathek_ as a preternaturally ugly old man with\r\nstrange powers. James Hogg has rather a penchant for the demon, for he\r\nuses him in The _Wool-Gatherer_, and in _Confessions of a Justified\r\nSinner_, which is a story of religious superstition, of the use of\r\ndiablerie and witchcraft, introducing a satanic tempter. On the whole,\r\nthe appearances of the devil in Gothic fiction lack impressiveness, are\r\nweak in psychologic subtlety, and have not the force either of the epic\r\nor of the dramatic representations. Nor have they the human appeal that\r\nthe incarnations of the devil in later fiction make to our sympathies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the unholy powers possessed by the devil and given by\r\nhim to his agents, the witches, warlocks and magicians, we see in\r\nGothic fiction other aspects of dæmonology, such as that associated\r\nwith animals and with inanimate objects. Supernaturalism in the horror\r\nnovel is by no means confined to human beings, but extends to beasts\r\nas well. Animals are supposed to be peculiarly sensitive to ghostly\r\nimpressions, more so than men, and the appearance of a specter is\r\noften first announced by the extreme terror of some household pet,\r\nor other animal. Gothic dogs have very keen noses for ghosts and howl\r\nlugubriously when an apparition approaches. Ravens are represented as\r\nshowing the presence of evil powers, somewhat as the Southern darkey\r\nbelieves that the jay-bird is the ally of the devil and spends every\r\nFriday in torment. And one does not forget the snaky coiffure that\r\nwrithed around the demon's head in _The Monk_.\r\n\r\nMaturin's _Albigenses_ introduces the story of a gruesome loup-garou,\r\nor werewolf, which figures extensively in folk-tales. In this case\r\nthe husband of a beautiful young woman is a werewolf who during his\r\nsavage metamorphosis tears her to pieces then disappears to return no\r\nmore. This is suggestive--with a less satisfactory ending--of Marie de\r\nFrance's charming little _lai_, _Le Bisclavret_. Professor Kittridge\r\nhas shown the frequency of the werewolf motif in medieval story, by\r\nthe variants he brings together in his _Arthur and Gorlogon_. In _The\r\nAlbigenses_ a lycanthrope also is described, a hideous human being that\r\nfancies himself a mad wolf.\r\n\r\nThere is much use of animal supernaturalism in James Hogg's romances.\r\nIn one,[18] Sandy is saved from going over a precipice by the warning\r\nof a hare that immediately after vanishes, having left no tracks in\r\nthe snow. In another,[19] the two white beagles that the king uses in\r\nhunting are in reality maidens bound by enchantment, who are forced\r\nto slay human beings then transform them into deer for the king and\r\nhis company to eat. The other dogs are aware of the unnatural state\r\nof affairs, while the men are too stupid to realize it. The clownish\r\nCroudy is changed into a hog, which brings amusing and almost tragic\r\ncomplications into his life. His old dog knows him and follows him\r\npathetically, and a drove of cows go off in a stampede at his approach,\r\nfor they, too, sense the supernatural spell. Croudy is put on the\r\nblock to be killed for pork, when the fairy changes him back suddenly\r\nto the consternation of the butcher. But Croudy does not behave well\r\nafter his transformation, so he is changed into a cat with endless\r\nlife. He may resume mortal shape one night in the year and relate his\r\nfeline experiences.\r\n\r\n      [18] _The Wool-Gatherer._\r\n\r\n      [19] _The Hunt of Eildon._\r\n\r\nIn the same story the king of Scotland is proposing a toast when his\r\nfavorite dog dashes the cup from his hand. This is repeated several\r\ntimes, till the king learns that the drink is poisoned, and the dog has\r\nthus by supernatural knowledge saved his life. An innocent young girl,\r\nsentenced to death for witchcraft because a fairy has taken her form\r\nand worked enchantment, and her lover are transformed into white birds\r\nthat fly out of the prison the night before the execution and live\r\neternally on the shores of a far lake.\r\n\r\nThe ghostly power extends to inanimate objects as well as to human\r\nbeings and animals. Armor and costumes seem to have a material\r\nimmortality of their own, for it is quite common to recognize\r\nspectral visitants by their garments or accouterments. Armor clanks\r\naudibly in the terror scenes. In _The Castle of Otranto_, the giant\r\nghost sends his immense helmet crashing into the hall to shatter the\r\nwould-be-bridegroom and the hopes of his father. The head-gear has\r\npower of voluntary motion and moves around with agility, saves the\r\nheroine from danger by waving its plumes at the villain and generally\r\nadds excitement to the scenes. Later a titanic sword leaps into place\r\nof itself, after having been borne to the entrance by a hundred men\r\nfainting under the weight of it, while a statue of Alfonso sheds three\r\ndrops of blood from its nose and a portrait turns round in its frame\r\nand strolls out into the open.\r\n\r\nPictures in general take a lively part in horrific fiction. The\r\nportrait of a murdered man in _The Spirit of the Castle_ picks itself\r\nup from the lumber heap where it has been thrown, cleans itself and\r\nhangs itself back on the wall, while[20] a portrait in a deserted\r\nchamber wags its head at a servant who is making the bed. The portrait\r\nof Melmoth is endowed with supernatural power, for its eyes follow the\r\nbeholder with awful meaning, and as the nephew in desperation tears\r\nit from its frame and burns it, the picture writhes in the flames,\r\nironically, and mocks him. This might be compared with Oscar Wilde's\r\n_Picture of Dorian Gray_ and with other later stories.\r\n\r\n      [20] In _The Spirit of Turrettville_.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Alfonso in Walpole's _Castle_ moves from its place with\r\nno visible means of support, and[21] a great effigy of black marble\r\nis said to \"march all round and come back into its place again with a\r\ngreat groan.\" In _St. Oswyth_ the soil of the abbey grounds obtained\r\nby gross injustice is haunted by the ghost of the wronged nun who\r\ninflicts a curse upon it, rendering it \"spell-blighted, unprolific,\r\nand impossible to till.\" The key to the room in the old house in which\r\nMelmoth's diabolic portrait is kept, turns in its lock with a sound\r\nlike the cry of the dead.\r\n\r\n      [21] In _Ariel_.\r\n\r\nGothic romance contains magic mirrors wherein one can see any person\r\nhe wishes no matter how distant he may be, and watch his movements\r\nafter the fashion of a private moving-picture show,--such as that used\r\nby Ambrosio.[22] There are enchanted wands with power to transform\r\nmen to beasts or _vice versa_, as in _The Hunt of Eildon_. There\r\nare crystal balls that reveal not only what is going on in distant\r\nparts, but show the future as well.[23] The same volume describes\r\nmagic swords that bear changing hieroglyphics to be read only by\r\nenchantment and other uncanny objects. These will serve to illustrate\r\nthe preternatural powers possessed by inanimate objects in the terror\r\nliterature. In some instances the motif is used with effectiveness,\r\ndefinitely heightening the impression of the weird in a way that\r\nhuman supernaturalism could not accomplish. We do not see here the\r\nmechanistic supernaturalism, which is to become important in later\r\ntales, and the effects here are crude, yet of interest in themselves\r\nand as suggesting later uses of the idea.\r\n\r\n      [22] In _The Monk_.\r\n\r\n      [23] As in _Vathek_.\r\n\r\nDæmonology manifests itself in the supernatural science in the Gothic\r\nnovels as well as in the characterization of the devil and his\r\nconfreres. We have diabolical chemistry besides alchemy, astrology,\r\nhypnotism, ventriloquism, search for the philosopher's stone, infernal\r\nbiology, and the other scientific twists of supernaturalism. In\r\n_Vathek_, where we have a regular array of ghostliness, we see a magic\r\npotion that instantly cures any disease however deadly,--the progenitor\r\nof the modern patent medicine. There is an Indian magician who writes\r\nhis messages on the high heavens themselves. Vathek's mother is an\r\nindustrious alchemist strangling an assembly of prominent citizens in\r\norder to use their cadavers in her laboratory, where she stews them\r\nup with serpent's oil, mummies, and skulls, concocting therefrom a\r\npowerful potion. Vathek has an uncurbed curiosity that leads him into\r\nvarious experiments, to peer into the secrets of astrology, alchemy,\r\nsorcery, and kindred sciences. He uses a magic drink that gives the\r\nsemblance of death, like that used later in _The Monk_, as earlier, of\r\ncourse, in _Romeo and Juliet_, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Moor in _Zofloya_ is well versed in dæmonic science. He tells of\r\nchemical experiments where he forces everyone to do his will or die.\r\nBy his potions he can change hate into love or love into hate, and\r\ncan give a drug which produces semi-insanity. Under the influence of\r\nthis a man weds a dæmonic temptress thinking her the woman he loves,\r\nthen commits suicide when he wakes to the truth. This reminds us of\r\nSax Rohmer's Fu-Manchu stories of diabolic hypodermics that produce\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nIn _Ankerwich Castle_ a woman lying at the point of death is\r\nmiraculously cured by a drug whose prescription the author neglects\r\nto state. In the same story a child is branded in a peculiar fashion.\r\nA new-born babe whose birth must remain secret yet who must be\r\nrecognizable in emergency, is marked on its side with letters burnt in\r\nwith a strange chemical, which will remain invisible till rubbed with a\r\ncertain liquid. Matilda in _The Monk_ dabbles in satanic chemistry and\r\ncompounds evil potions in her subterranean experiments.\r\n\r\nMary Shelley uses the idea of supernatural biology in her story of the\r\nman-monster, _Frankenstein_, the story of the young scientist who after\r\nmorbid study and experiment, constructs a human frame of supernatural\r\nsize and hideous grotesqueness and gives it life. But the thing created\r\nappalls its creator by its dreadful visage, its more than human size,\r\nits look of less than human intelligence, and the student flees in\r\nhorror from the sight of it. Mrs. Shelley describes the emotions of the\r\nlonely, tragic thing thrust suddenly into a world that ever recoils\r\nshuddering from it. She reveals the slow hate distilled in its heart\r\nbecause of the harsh treatment it meets, till at last it takes diabolic\r\nrevenge, not only on the man who has created it but on all held dear\r\nby him. The struggles that rend his soul between hate and remorse are\r\nimpressive. The wretched being weeps in an agony of grief as it stands\r\nover the body of Frankenstein whom it has harried to death, then goes\r\naway to its own doom. The last sight of it, as the first, is effective,\r\nas, in tragic solitude, towering on the ice-floe, it moves toward the\r\ndesolate North to its death.\r\n\r\nIn the characterization of this being, as in the unusual conception,\r\nMrs. Shelley has introduced something poignantly new in fiction. It\r\nwas a startling theme for the mind of a young girl, as were _Vathek_\r\nand _The Monk_ for youths of twenty years, and only the abnormal\r\npsychological conditions she went through could have produced it. There\r\nis more curdling awfulness in Frankenstein's monster than in the museum\r\nof armored ghosts, Bleeding Nuns, and accompanying horrors of the early\r\nGothic novels. The employment of the Frankenstein motif in a play\r\nproduced recently in New York,[24] illustrates anew the vitality of the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n      [24] _The Last Laugh._\r\n\r\nThe search for the philosopher's stone appears in various novels of\r\nthe period. _St. Leon_, by William Godwin, relates the story of a man\r\nwho knew how to produce unlimited gold by a secret formula given him\r\nby a mysterious stranger who dies in his home. Shelley[25] brings\r\nin this power incidentally with the gift of endless life. There is\r\nan awe-inspiring use of ventriloquism in Charles Brockden Brown's\r\nnovel, _Wieland_, while _Arthur Mervyn_ gives a study in somnambulism.\r\n_Zofloya_ suggests hypnotism or mesmerism by saying that Victoria's\r\nthought summoned the Moor to her,--that they could have brought him\r\nhad he been \"at the further extremity of this terrestrial globe.\" This\r\nseems a faint foreshadowing of Ibsen's idea in The _Master Builder_.\r\nThese may illustrate the use of science in Gothicism.\r\n\r\n      [25] In _St. Irvyne_.\r\n\r\nThe elixir of life is brewed in divers Gothic novels. Dramatic and\r\nintense as are the psychological experiences connected with the\r\ndiscovery of the magic potion, the effects of the success are more\r\npoignant still. The thought that endless mortality, life that may not\r\nbe laid down, becomes a burden intolerable has appeared in fiction\r\nsince Swift's account of the Struldbrugs, and perhaps before. Godwin's\r\n_St. Leon_ is a story of the secret of perpetual life. The tiresome\r\nGodwinistic hero is visited by a decrepit old man who wishes to tell\r\nhim on a pledge of incommunicability what will give him the power of\r\nendless life and boundless wealth. The impoverished nobleman accepts\r\nwith consequences less enjoyable than he has anticipated.\r\n\r\nShelley's hectic romance,[26] whose idea, as Shelley admitted to\r\nStockdale, came from Godwin's book, uses the same theme. The young\r\nstudent with burning eyes, who has discovered the elixir of life, may\r\nbe compared with Mary Shelley's later picture of Frankenstein. Events\r\nare rather confused here, as the villain falls dead in the presence of\r\nthe devil but comes to life again as another character later in the\r\nstory,--Shelley informing us of their identity but not troubling to\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\n      [26] _St. Irvyne or the Rosicrucian._\r\n\r\nThe most impressive instance of the theme of fleshly immortality in\r\nthe early novels is found in _Melmoth_. Here the mysterious wanderer\r\npossesses the power of endless life, but not the right to lay it down\r\nwhen existence becomes a burden. Melmoth can win the boon of death\r\nonly if he can find another mortal willing to change destinies with\r\nhim at the price of his soul. He traverses the world in his search and\r\noffers the exchange to persons in direst need and suffering the extreme\r\ntorments, offering to give them wealth as well as life eternal. Yet no\r\nman nor woman will buy life at the price of the soul.\r\n\r\n=Aids to Gothic Effect.= Certain themes appear recurringly as first\r\naids to terror fiction. Some of them are found equally in later\r\nliterature while others belong more particularly to the Gothic. An\r\ninteresting aspect of the supernatural visitants is gigantism, or\r\nthe superhuman size which they assume. In _The Castle of Otranto_,\r\nthe sensational ghost is of enormous size, and his accouterments are\r\ncolossal. In the last scene he is astounding:\r\n\r\n  A clap of thunder shook the castle to its foundations; the earth\r\n  rocked and the clank of more than mortal armor was heard behind....\r\n  The walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a\r\n  mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense\r\n  magnitude, appeared in the center of the ruins. \"Behold the true\r\n  heir of Alfonso!\" said the vision.\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of an incident in F. Marion Crawford's _Mr. Isaacs_,\r\nwhere the Indian magician expands to awful size, miraculously draws\r\ndown a mist and wraps it round him as a cloak. Zofloya is frequently\r\nspoken of as immense, and it is said that \"common objects seem to\r\nsink in his presence.\" In the last scene the wicked Victoria sees\r\nthe Moor change from a handsome youth to a fierce gigantic figure. A\r\ndiabolic apparition eight or nine feet high pursues a monk,[27] and the\r\nknight[28] engages in combat with a dæmonic giant who slays him. The\r\ndevil in _The Monk_ is represented as being of enormous stature, and\r\nmuch of the horror excited by the man-monster that Frankenstein created\r\narises from the creature's superhuman size. In most cases gigantism\r\nconnotes evil power and rouses a supernatural awe in the beholder. The\r\ngiant is an Oriental figure and appears in _Vathek_, along with genii,\r\ndwarfs, and kindred personages, but the Gothic giant has more diabolism\r\nthan the mere Oriental original. He seems to fade out from fiction,\r\nappearing only occasionally in later stories, while he has practically\r\nno place in the drama, owing doubtless to the difficulties of stage\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n      [27] In _The Spirit of the Castle_.\r\n\r\n      [28] In _The Spirit of Turrettville_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInsanity as contributing to the effect of supernaturalism affords many\r\ngruesome studies in psychiatry. Madness seems a special curse of the\r\ngods or torment from the devil and various instances of its use occur\r\nin Gothic fiction. The devil in _Zofloya_, at Victoria's request, gives\r\nHenrique an enchanted drug which renders him temporarily insane,\r\nduring which time he marries Victoria, imagining her to be Lilla whom\r\nhe loves. When he awakes to the realization of what he has done, real\r\nmadness drives him to suicide. In _The Castle of Caithness_ the wicked\r\nmisanthrope goes mad from remorse. He imagines that the different\r\nones he has murdered are hurling him into the pit of hell, until, in\r\na maniac frenzy, he dashes his brains out against the prison walls.\r\nIn _Ethelwina_ the father who has sold his daughter to dishonor flies\r\nshrieking in madness through the corridors of the dungeon to escape the\r\nsight of his child's accusing specter. Poor Nanny in Hogg's _Brownie of\r\nBodbeck_ is described as having \"a beam of wild delight in her eye, the\r\njoy of madness.\" She sings wild, unearthly songs and talks deliriously\r\nof incomprehensible things, of devilish struggles.\r\n\r\nMelmoth uses the idea with special effectiveness. The insanity of the\r\nyoung husband whose bride is mysteriously slain on their wedding day\r\nby the supernatural power accompanying Melmoth, may be compared with\r\nthe madness of the wife in Scott's _Bride of Lammermoor_. Maturin\r\nalso shows us a scene in a mad-house, where a sane man, Stanton, is\r\nconfined, whom Melmoth visits to offer exchange of destinies. Melmoth\r\ntaunts him cruelly with his hopeless situation and prophecies that he,\r\ntoo, will go mad from despair. We hear Stanton's wild cry, echoed by a\r\nhundred yells like those of demons, but the others are stilled when the\r\nmad mother begins her lamentation,--the mother who has lost husband,\r\nhome, children, reason, all, in the great London fire. At her appalling\r\nshrieks all other voices are hushed. Another impressive figure in the\r\nmad-house is the preacher who thinks himself a demon and alternately\r\nprays and blasphemes the Lord.\r\n\r\nCharles Brockden Brown rivals Maturin in his terrible use of insanity\r\nfor supernatural effect. The demented murderer in _Edgar Huntley_\r\ngives an impression of mystery and awe that is unusual, while _Wieland_\r\nwith its religious mania produced by diabolic ventriloquism is even\r\nmore impressive. Brown knew the effect of mystery and dread on the\r\nhuman mind and by slow, cumulative suggestion he makes us feel a\r\ncreeping awe that the unwieldy machinery of pure Gothicism never could\r\nachieve. In studies of the morbid mentality he has few equals. For\r\npsychologic subtlety, for haunting horror, what is a crashing helmet\r\nor a dismembered ghost compared with Brown's Wieland? What are the\r\nrackings of monkish vindictiveness when set against the agonies of an\r\nunbalanced mind turned in upon itself? What exterior torture could\r\nso appeal to our sympathies as Wieland's despair, when, racked with\r\nreligious mania, he feels the overwhelming conviction that the voice of\r\nGod--which is but the fiendish trick of a ventriloquist--is calling him\r\nto murder his wife and children as a sacrifice to Deity? Such a tragedy\r\nof dethroned reason is intolerably powerful; the dark labyrinths of\r\ninsanity, the gloom-haunted passages of the human mind, are more\r\nterrible to traverse than the midnight windings of Gothic dungeons. We\r\nfeel that here is a man who is real, who is human, and suffering the\r\nextremity of anguish.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most hideous aspect of insanity in the terror novel is\r\nthat of the lycanthrope in _The Albigenses_. The tragic wolf-man\r\nimagines himself to be a mad wolf and cowers in his lair, glaring with\r\ngleaming, awful eyes at all who approach him, gnawing at a human head\r\nsnatched from the graveyard. There are various other uses of insanity\r\nin the novel of the period, but these will serve to illustrate. The\r\nrelation between insanity and the supernatural has been marked in later\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe use of portents is a distinct characteristic of the horror romance.\r\nCalamity is generally preceded by some sign of the supernatural\r\ninfluence at work, some presentment of dread. Crime and catastrophe\r\nare forefelt by premonition of woe and accompaniment of horror. In\r\n_The Accusing Spirit_ supernatural thunder heralds the discovery of\r\nthe corpse in its winding-sheet, and the monk says, \"Yes, some dread\r\ndiscovery is at hand. These phenomena are miraculous; when the common\r\nlaws of nature are violated, the awful portents are not sent in vain.\"\r\nIn _The Romance of the Castle_, an anonymous story, a woman hears the\r\nclock strike two and announces that she will be dead at three.\r\n\r\n  This night an awful messenger sent from that dread tribunal from\r\n  whose power there is no appeal, by signs terrific foretold my fate\r\n  approached--foretold my final moment. \"Catherine, behold!\" was all\r\n  that issued from the specter's lips, but in its hand it held a\r\n  scroll which fixed my irrevocable doom, in letters which fascinated\r\n  while they appalled my sight.\r\n\r\nShe keeps her appointment promptly. Her experience might be compared\r\nwith the vision which revealed his date of death to Amos Judd in James\r\nMitchell's novel of that name, and to the foreknowledge in George\r\nEliot's _The Lifted Veil_.\r\n\r\nIn _The Spirit of the Castle_,[29] the ghost of the old marquis knocks\r\nthree times on the door preceding the arrival of the heir, and a black\r\nraven flies away as he enters. At the approach of the true heir to the\r\nestate from which he has been kept by fraud in _The Old English Baron_,\r\nthe doors of the ancient castle fly open, upon which the servants cry,\r\n\"The doors open of themselves to receive their master!\" When Walpole's\r\nusurping Manfred sees the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken\r\nin concert with the brazen trumpet, he exclaims, \"What mean these\r\nportents? If I have offended----\" At this point the plumes are shaken\r\nstill more strenuously, and the helmet is equally agitated when the\r\ngreat sword leaps in. Manfred cries to the apparition, \"If thou art a\r\ntrue knight, thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy power. If\r\nthese omens be from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to righteousness to\r\nprotect his cause.\" But the omens bring bad luck to Manfred.\r\n\r\n      [29] By W. C. Proby.\r\n\r\nThere is much use of portent in _Melmoth_. The specter of the Wanderer\r\nappearing just before the old man's death predicts the spiritual doom\r\nof the dying. As the old uncle is almost breathing his last, he cries\r\nout, \"What the devil brings you here?\" at which the servants cross\r\nthemselves and cry, \"The devil in his mouth!\" Melmoth, the Wanderer,\r\nis a walking portent of evil, for the priest is unable to pray in his\r\npresence, the communion bread turns viperous when he is there and\r\nthe priest falls dead in the attempt to exorcise the fiendish power.\r\nMysterious strains of music sound as heralds of disaster in several\r\nGothic novels, as[30] where the inexplicable strains are heard only by\r\nthe bride and groom preceding the strange tragedy that befalls them.\r\n\r\n      [30] In _Melmoth_.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of a supernatural visitant in the terror novel the fire\r\nalways burns blue,--where there is a fire, and the great hearth usually\r\naffords ample opportunity for such portentous blaze. The thermometer\r\nitself tends to take a downward path when a ghost draws near. The\r\nthree drops of blood shed from the statue's nose in _Otranto_, while\r\nridiculed by the critics, are meant simply as a portent of evil. Prof.\r\nWilliam Lyon Phelps points out[31] that the idea did not originate\r\nwith Walpole, but was familiar as a superstition regarding premonition\r\nof ill, as referred to in Dryden's _Amboyna_, IV., 1. This instance\r\nmay be compared with the much more skillfully handled omens in later\r\ndrama, as Maeterlinck's and Ibsen's, particularly in _The Emperor and\r\nGalilean_. Various other portents of ill appear in Gothic fiction.[32]\r\n\r\n      [31] In his _Beginnings of the English Romantic Movement_, p.\r\n      108.\r\n\r\n      [32] Eliza Heywood's romance, _Lasselia: or, the Self-Abandoned_,\r\n      shows a similar portent, as Dr. George Frisbee Whicher notes in\r\n      his _The Life and Romances of Mrs. Eliza Heywood_.\r\n\r\n      Professor Ashley H. Thorndike, in his _Tragedy_, in speaking\r\n      of the plays of the Restoration dramatist John Banks (p. 273),\r\n      says: \"Even the portents are reduced to a peculiar decorum:--\r\n\r\n         \"Last night no sooner was I laid to rest\r\n          Than just three drops of blood fell from my nose!\"\r\n\r\n      These three drops of blood probably have a much more extended\r\n      history in romance and the drama, which it would be interesting\r\n      to trace out.\r\n\r\nThe symbols of dread and the ghostly are used to good effect in\r\nthe terror romance. The cumulative effects of supernatural awe\r\nare carefully built up by the use of gruesome accompaniments and\r\nsuggestions. The triple veil of night, desolation, and silence usually\r\nhangs over the haunter and the haunted, predisposing to an uncanny\r\npsychosis. The Gothic ghost does not love the garish day, and the\r\nterror castle, gloomy even under the brightest sun, is of unimaginable\r\ndarkness at night. Certain houses add especially to the impression of\r\nfear. At crucial moments the stroke of twelve or one o'clock is sure\r\nto be sounded appallingly by some abbey bell or castle clock or other\r\nrusty horologue. In addition to its services as time-keeper, the bell\r\nhas a predisposition to toll.\r\n\r\nMelancholy birds fly freely through these medieval tales, their dark\r\nwings adding to the general gloom. The principal specimens in the\r\nGothic aviary are the common owl, the screech or \"screeching\" owl, the\r\nbat and the raven, while the flock is increased by anonymous \"birds of\r\nprey,\" \"night birds,\" \"gloomy birds\" and so forth. In _St. Oswyth_,\r\nas the murderer steals at midnight through the corridor toward his\r\nhelpless victim, \"the ill-boding bird of night that sat screeching on\r\nthe battlement of the prison tower, whose harsh, discordant notes were\r\nechoed by the hoarse croaking of the ominous raven\" terrifies but does\r\nnot deter the villain.\r\n\r\nThe \"moping, melancholy screech owl\" is one of the prominent personages\r\nin _The Accusing Spirit_, emphasizing the moments of special suspense,\r\nas in _St. Oswyth_ as the wicked baron lies quaking in remorse for\r\nhaving caused a nun to be buried alive, the condemning cry of the\r\ndoleful birds increases his mental anguish. Similar instances, with\r\nor without special nomenclature, occur in countless Gothic novels.\r\nMuch use is also made of the dark ivy in its clambering over medieval\r\narchitecture, shutting out the light and adding to the general gloom.\r\nThe effect of horror is increased frequently by the location of the\r\nscenes in vaults and graveyards with all their gruesome accessories,\r\nand skulls are used as mural ornaments elsewhere, or as library\r\nappointments by persons of morbid temperament. Enough skeletons are\r\nexhumed to furnish as large a pile of bones as may be seen in certain\r\nantique churches in Italy and Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe element of mystery and mystification is another family feature of\r\nthe novel of suspense. There is no proper thrill without the suspense\r\nattained by supernatural mystery. Even the novels that in the end\r\ncarefully explain away all the ghostly phenomena on a natural basis\r\nstrive with care to build up plots which shall contain astounding\r\ndiscoveries. Mrs. Radcliffe and Regina Maria Roche are noted in this\r\nrespect. They have not the courage of their ghosts as such but, after\r\nthey have thrilled the reader to the desired extent, they tear down the\r\nfabric of mystification that they have constructed and meticulously\r\nexplain everything.\r\n\r\nThe black veil constitutes a favorite method of suspense with Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe. On various occasions Emily pales and quivers before a dark\r\nvelvet pall uncannily swaying in the midnight wind, and on one such\r\nramble she draws aside the curtain and finds a hideous corpse, putrid\r\nand dropping to decay, lying on a couch behind the pall. Many chapters\r\nfurther on she learns that this is a wax figure made to serve as\r\npenance for an ancient sinner. Again she shivers in front of the inky\r\ncurtain, watching its fold move unaccountably, when a repulsive face\r\npeers out at her. She shrieks and flees, thinking she has seen a ghost,\r\nbut discovers later that it is _only_ one of a company of bandits that\r\nhave taken up their secret abode in the house. Black veils are in\r\nfashion in all of Mrs. Radcliffe's romances and she drapes them very\r\neffectively, while the arras waves likewise in other tales as well.\r\n\r\nMysterious manuscripts are another means of mystification. Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe's novels also abound in such scripts. In _The Romance of\r\nthe Forest_ Adeline discovers a decaying paper which reads, \"Oh, ye,\r\nwhoever ye are, that chance or misfortune may direct to this spot, to\r\nyou I speak, to you reveal the story of my wrongs and ask you to avenge\r\nthem.\" This injunction to avenge wrongs is a frequent assignment,\r\nthough rather much to ask in most cases. _The Spirit of the Castle_ has\r\nits dusty document that starts off: \"Already my hand brandishes the\r\ndagger that shall close my eyes forever. (Mysterious manuscripts are\r\nnot strong on grammar and make slight attempt to avoid mixed figures.)\r\nI will expire by the side of the clay-cold corpse of my Antoinette.\" In\r\n_St. Oswyth_ the paper says, \"Beneath the deep foundations of the ruin\r\nthe recorded mystery of the house of Oswyth lies buried from all mortal\r\ndiscovery.\" But the most impressive manuscript is the one in _Melmoth_\r\nthat records the wanderings of the agonized fate-harried man and those\r\nwhose tortures he witnesses. A codicil to the old uncle's will advises\r\nhis nephew against reading the document, but of course he does read\r\nit, since what are mouldy manuscripts in Gothic novels for, but to be\r\ndeciphered by the hero or heroine?\r\n\r\nReference to dread secrets occur otherwise than in written form. In one\r\nfavored tale,[33] we are told of \"a mystery whose elucidation I now\r\nhave a presentiment would fill me with horror!\" In another,[34] Vincent\r\non his death-bed speaks of \"a horrid secret which labors at my breast,\"\r\nand the Abate speaks to the marquis of \"a secret which shall make\r\nyour blood run cold!\" In _St. Oswyth_ we hear that \"an impenetrable\r\ncloud of cureless sorrow hung over Sir Alfred and there was a dreadful\r\nmystery in his life destiny, unknown, as it should seem, to any one,\r\nand which he was unwilling should be questioned.\" The dungeoned\r\nprisoner in _Bungay Castle_ cries, \"Were I at liberty to speak I could\r\na tale unfold would tempt you to curse the world and even detest those\r\nclaims which bind man to man. You would be ready to forego the ties of\r\nnature and shun society. Time must, it will develop the whole of this\r\nmystery!\" And so on.\r\n\r\n      [33] Regina Maria Roche's _Clermont_.\r\n\r\n      [34] _A Sicilian Romance_, by Mrs. Radcliffe.\r\n\r\nInexplicable music forms one of the commonest elements of mystification\r\nin these romances. Its constant recurrence suggests that there\r\nmust have been victrolas in medieval times. The music is chiefly\r\ninstrumental, sometimes on a harp, sometimes on a violin, though\r\noccasionally it is vocal. Mrs. Radcliffe and Regina Maria Roche\r\naccompany the heroine's musings at all hours with doleful strains\r\nsuspected to be of supernatural performance. The appearance of the\r\ndevil masquerading as the Moor[35] is heralded by flute-like sounds,\r\nand in _The Spirit of Turrettville_ the specter plays on the harp and\r\nsings. The recurrence of the theme is so constant that it acquires the\r\nmonotony of a tantalizing refrain.\r\n\r\n      [35] In _Zofloya_.\r\n\r\nGroans and wails of unexplained origin also aid in building up\r\nsuspense. In fact, a chorus of lugubriousness arises so that the Gothic\r\npages groan as they are turned. Mysterious disappearances likewise\r\nincrease the tension. Lights appear and vanish with alarming volition,\r\ndoors open and close with no visible human assistance, and various\r\nother supernatural phenomena aid in Gothic mystery and mystification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the ghosts and devils occupy the center of interest in the\r\nhorrific romance, the human characters must not be lightly passed over.\r\nThere are terror temperaments as well as Gothic castles, tempests, and\r\nscenes. The interfering father or other relative, brutal in threats\r\nand breathing forth slaughter, comes in frequently to oppress the\r\nhero or heroine into a loathed marriage. The hero is of Radcliffian\r\ngloom, a person of vague past and saturnine temper, admired and\r\nimitated by Byron. Sir Walter Raleigh,[36] says, \"The man that Byron\r\ntried to be was the invention of Mrs. Radcliffe.\" The officials of\r\nthe Inquisition and the dominant figures in convents and monasteries\r\nshow fiendish cruelty toward helpless inmates, gloating in Gothic\r\ndiabolism over their tortures. There are no restful human shades of\r\ngray, only unrelieved black and white characters. The Romantic heroine\r\nis a peculiar creature, much given to swooning and weeping, yet always\r\nimpeccably clad in no matter what nocturnal emergency she is surprised.\r\nShe tumbles into verse and sketching on slight provocation, but her\r\nworst vice is that of curiosity. In her search for supernatural horrors\r\nshe wanders at midnight through apartments where she does not belong,\r\nbreaks open boxes, desks, and secret hiding-places to read whatever\r\nletters or manuscripts she can lay her hands on, behaving generally\r\nlike the yellow journalist of fiction.\r\n\r\n      [36] In _The English Novel_, p. 228.\r\n\r\nThe pages of the Gothic novel are smeared with gore and turn with\r\nghostly flutter. The conversation is like nothing on land or sea or\r\nin the waters under the earth, for the tadpoles talk like Johnsonian\r\nwhales and the reader grows restless under Godwinistic disquisitions.\r\nThe authors are almost totally lacking in a sense of humor, yet the\r\nGothic novel, taken as a whole, is one of the best specimens of\r\nunconscious humor known to English literature.\r\n\r\n=Conclusion.= Perhaps the most valuable contribution that the Gothic\r\nschool made to English literature is Jane Austen's inimitable satire\r\nof it, _Northanger Abbey_. Though written as her first novel and sold\r\nin 1797, it did not appear till after her death, in 1818. Its purpose\r\nis to ridicule the Romanticists and the book in itself would justify\r\nthe terroristic school, but she was ahead of her times, so the editor\r\nfeared to publish it. In the meantime she wrote her other satires on\r\nsociety and won immortality for her work which might never have been\r\nbegun save for her satiety of medieval romances. The title of the story\r\nitself is imitative, and the well-known materials are all present,\r\nyet how differently employed! The setting is a Gothic abbey tempered\r\nto modern comfort; the interfering father is not vicious, merely\r\nill-natured; the pursuing, repulsive lover is not a villain, only a\r\nsilly bore. The heroine has no beauty, nor does she topple into sonnets\r\nnor snatch a pencil to sketch the scene, for we are told that she has\r\nno accomplishments. Yet she goes through palpitating adventures mostly\r\nmodelled on Mrs. Radcliffe's incidents. She is hampered in not being\r\nsupplied with a lover who is the unrecognized heir to vast estates,\r\nsince all the young men in the county are properly provided with\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe delicious persiflage in which Jane Austen hits off the fiction of\r\nthe day may be illustrated by a bit of conversation between two young\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\n  \"My dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all\r\n  the morning? Have you gone on with _Udolpho_?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Yes; I have been reading it ever since I woke, and I have got to\r\n  the black veil.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh, I would not tell you what is\r\n  behind that black veil for the world! Are you not wild to know?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, yes, quite! What can it be? But do not tell me--I would not be\r\n  told on any account. I know it must be a skeleton; I am sure it is\r\n  Laurentina's skeleton. Oh, I am delighted with the book! I should\r\n  like to spend my whole life reading it, I assure you. If it had not\r\n  been to meet you, I would not have come away from it for the world.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Dear creature! How much obliged I am to you; and when you have\r\n  finished _Udolpho_, we will read _The Italian_ together; and I have\r\n  made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Have you, indeed? How glad I am! What are they all?\"\r\n\r\n  \"I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my\r\n  pocket-book: _Castle of Wolfenbach_, _Clermont_, _Mysterious\r\n  Warnings_, _Necromancer of the Black Forest_, _Midnight Bell,\r\n  Orphan of the Rhine_, and _Horrid Mysteries_. These will last us\r\n  some time.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid? Are you sure they are\r\n  all horrid?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss\r\n  Andrews--a sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the\r\n  world--has read every one of them!\"\r\n\r\nMr. George Saintsbury[37] expresses himself as sceptical of this list\r\nas a catalogue of actual romances, stating that he has never read one\r\nof them and should like some other authority than Miss Andrews for\r\ntheir existence. He is mistaken in his doubt, however, since during\r\nthe progress of this investigation four out of the eight have been\r\nidentified as to authorship, and doubtless the others are lurking in\r\nsome antique library. _Clermont_ is by Maria Regina Roche; _Mysterious\r\nWarnings_ by Mrs. Parsons, in London, 1796; _Midnight Bell_ by Francis\r\nLatham; and _Horrid Mysteries_ by Marquis Grosse, London, 1796.\r\n\r\n      [37] In his introduction to his pocket volume of _Tales of\r\n      Mystery_.\r\n\r\nJane Austen's stupid bore, John Thorpe, and Mr. Tilney, the impeccable,\r\npedantic hero, add their comment to Gothic fiction, one saying with a\r\nyawn that there hasn't been a decent novel since _Tom Jones_, except\r\n_The Monk_, and the other that he read _Udolpho_ in two days with his\r\nhair standing on end all the time.\r\n\r\nBut the real cleverness of the work consists in the burlesque of Gothic\r\nexperiences that Catherine, because of the excited condition of her\r\nmind induced by excess of romantic fiction, goes through with on her\r\nvisit to Northanger Abbey. She explores secret wings in a search for\r\nhorrors, only to find sunny rooms, with no imprisoned wife, not a\r\nsingle maniac, and never skeleton of tortured nun. Mr. Tilney's ironic\r\njests satirize all the elements of Gothic romance. Opening a black\r\nchest at midnight, she finds a yellowed manuscript, but just as she is\r\nabout to read it her candle flickers out. In the morning sunshine she\r\nfinds that it is an old laundry list. The only result of her suspicious\r\nexplorings is that she is caught in such prowlings by the young man\r\nwhose esteem she wishes to win. He sarcastically assures her that his\r\nfather is not a wife-murderer, that his mother is not immured in a\r\ndungeon, but died of a bilious attack. These delicately tipped shafts\r\nof ridicule riddle the armor of medievalism and give it at the same\r\ntime a permanency of interest because of Jane Austen's treatment of\r\nit. The Gothic novel will be remembered, if for nothing else, for her\r\nparody of it.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Austen is not the only satirist of the _genre_. In _The\r\nHeroine_, Eaton Stannard Barrett gives an amusing burlesque of it.\r\nIt is interesting to note in this connection that while _Northanger\r\nAbbey_ was written and sold in 1797 it was not published till 1818, and\r\nBarrett's book, while written later, was published in 1813.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, an epistle, supposed to be endited by one\r\nCherubina, says:\r\n\r\n      MOON, May 1, 1813.\r\n\r\n  Know that the moment that a mortal manuscript is written in a\r\n  legible hand and the word End or Finis attached thereto, whatever\r\n  characters happen to be sketched therein acquire the quality\r\n  of creating a soul or spirit which takes flight and ascends\r\n  immediately through the regions of the air till it arrives at the\r\n  moon, where it is embodied and becomes a living creature, the\r\n  precise counterpart of the literary prototype.\r\n\r\n  Know farther that all the towns, villages, rivers, hills, and\r\n  valleys of the moon also owe their origin to the descriptions which\r\n  writers give of the landscapes of the earth.\r\n\r\n  By means of a book, _The Heroine_, I became a living inhabitant\r\n  of the moon. I met with the Radclyffian and Rochian heroines, and\r\n  others, but they tossed their heads and told me pertly that I was a\r\n  slur on the sisterhood, and some went so far as to say that I had a\r\n  design on their lives.\r\n\r\nCherry, an unsophisticated country girl, becomes Cherubina after\r\nreading romantic tales. She decides that she is an heiress kept in\r\nunwarranted seclusion, and tells her father that he cannot possibly be\r\nher father since he is \"a fat, funny farmer.\" She rummages in his desk\r\nfor private papers, discovering a torn scrap that she interprets to her\r\ndesires. She flies, leaving a note to tell the fleshy agriculturist\r\nthat she is gone \"to wander over the convex earth in search of her\r\nparents,\" with what comic experiences one may imagine. There is\r\nmuch discussion of the Gothic heroine, particularly those from Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe's and Regina Maria Roche's pages. The girl sprinkles her\r\nletters with verse. She passes through storms, explores deserted\r\nhouses, and comes to what she thinks is her ancestral castle in London,\r\nbut is told that it is Covent Garden Theatre. She decides that she is\r\nNell Gwynne's niece and goes to that amiable person to demand all her\r\nproperty. She pokes around in the cellar to find her captive mother,\r\nand discovers an enormously fat woman playing with frogs, who drunkenly\r\ninsists that she is her mother. Leaving that place in disgust she takes\r\npossession of somebody else's castle and orders it furnished in Gothic\r\nstyle, according to romance. She has the fat farmer shut up in the\r\nmadhouse.\r\n\r\nThe book is very amusing, and a more pronounced parody on Gothicism\r\nthan _Northanger Abbey_ because the whole story turns round that\r\ntheme,--but, of course, it is not of so great literary value. It seems\r\nstrange, however, that it is so little known. It burlesques every\r\nfeature of terror fiction, the high-flown language, the excited oaths,\r\nthe feudal furniture, the medieval architecture, the Gothic weather,\r\nthe supernatural tempers, the spectral apparitions--one of which is\r\nso muscular that he struggles with the heroine as she locks him in a\r\ncloset, after throwing rapee into his face, which makes him sputter in\r\na mortal fashion. Cherubina finds a blade bone of mutton in some Gothic\r\ngarbage and takes it for a bone of an ancestor. Radcliffian adjectives\r\nreel across the pages and the whole plays up in a delightful parody the\r\nludicrous weaknesses and excesses of the terror fiction.\r\n\r\nLikewise the Anti-Jacobin parodies the Gothic ghost and there is\r\nconsiderable satire directed at the whole Gothic _genre_ in Thomas Love\r\nPeacock's novel _Nightmare Abbey_.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gothicism had a tonic effect on English literature, and\r\ninfluenced the continental fiction to no small degree. By giving an\r\ninterest and excitement gained from ghostly themes to fiction, the\r\nterror writers made romance popular as it had never been before and\r\nimmensely extended the range of its readers. The novel has never lost\r\nthe hold on popular fancy that the Gothic ghost gave to it. This\r\ninterest has increased through the various aspects of Romanticism\r\nsince then and in every period has found some form of supernaturalism\r\non which to feed. True, the machinery of Gothicism creaks audibly\r\nat times, some of the specters move too mechanically, and there\r\nis a general air of unreality that detracts from the effect. The\r\nsupernaturalism often lacks the naturalness which is necessary. Yet\r\nit is not fair to apply to these early efforts the same standards\r\nby which we judge the novels of to-day. While their range is narrow\r\nthey do achieve certain impressive effects. Though the class became\r\nconventionalized to an absurd degree and the later examples are\r\nlaughable, while a host of imitations made the type ridiculous, the\r\nGothic novel has an undeniable force.\r\n\r\nBesides the bringing of supernaturalism definitely into fiction, which\r\nis a distinct gain, we find other benefits as well. In Gothicism,\r\nif we examine closely, we find the beginnings of many forms of\r\nsupernaturalism that are crude here, but that are to develop into\r\nspecial power in later novels and short stories. The terror novel\r\nexcites our ridicule in some respects, yet, like other things that\r\narouse a certain measure of laughter, it has great value. It seems a\r\nfar cry from the perambulating statue in _Otranto_ to Lord Dunsany's\r\njade gods that move with measured, stony steps to wreak a terrible\r\nvengeance on mortals who have defied them, but the connection may be\r\nclearly enough seen. The dreadful experiments by which Frankenstein's\r\nmonster is created are close akin to the revolting vivisections of\r\nWells's Dr. Moreau, or the operations described by Arthur Machen\r\nwhereby human beings lose their souls and become diabolized, given\r\nover utterly to unspeakable evil. The psychic elements in _Zofloya_\r\nare crudely conceived, yet suggestive of the psychic horrors of the\r\nwork of Blackwood, Barry Pain, and Theodore Dreiser, for example. The\r\nanimal supernaturalism only lightly touched on in Gothic novels is to\r\nbe elaborated in the stories of ghostly beasts like those by Edith\r\nWharton, Kipling, Ambrose Bierce, and others. In fact, the greater\r\nnumber of the forms of the supernatural found in later fiction and\r\nthe drama are discoverable, in germ at least, in Gothic romance. The\r\nwork of this period gave a tremendous impetus to the uncanny elements\r\nof romanticism and the effect has been seen in the fiction and drama\r\nand poetry since that time. Its influence on the drama of its day\r\nmay be seen in Walpole's _Mysterious Mother_ and Lewis's _Castle\r\nSpecter_. Thomas Lovell Beddoe's extraordinary tragedy, _Death's Jest\r\nBook_, while largely Elizabethan in materials and method, is closely\r\nrelated to the Gothic as well. It would be impossible to understand or\r\nappreciate the supernatural in the nineteenth-century literature and\r\nthat of our own day without a knowledge of the Gothic to which most of\r\nit goes back. Like most beginnings, Gothicism is crude in its earlier\r\nforms, and conventional in the flood of imitations that followed the\r\nsuccessful attempts. But it is really vital and most of the ghostly\r\nfiction since that time has lineally descended from it rather than from\r\nthe supernaturalism of the epic or of the drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLater Influences\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gothic period marked a change in the vehicle of supernaturalism. In\r\nancient times the ghostly had been expressed in the epic or the drama,\r\nin medievalism in the romances, metrical and prose, as in Elizabethan\r\nliterature the drama was the specific form. But Gothicism brought it\r\nover frankly into the novel, which was a new thing. That is noteworthy,\r\nsince supernaturalism seems more closely related to poetry than to\r\nprose; and as the early dramas were for the most part poetic, it did\r\nnot require such a stretch of the imagination to give credence to\r\nthe unearthly. The ballad, the epic, the drama, had made the ghostly\r\nseem credible. But prose fiction is so much more materialistic that\r\nat first thought supernaturalism seems antagonistic to it. That this\r\nis not really the case is evidenced from the fact that fiction since\r\nthe terror times has retained the elements of awe then introduced, has\r\ndeveloped, and has greatly added to them.\r\n\r\nWith the dying out of the _genre_ definitely known as the Gothic\r\nnovel and the turning of Romanticism into various new channels, we\r\nmight expect to see the disappearance of the ghostly element, since\r\nit had been overworked in terrorism. It is true that the prevailing\r\ntype of fiction for the succeeding period was realism, but with a\r\nlarge admixture of the supernormal or supernatural. The supernatural\r\nmachinery had become so well established in prose fiction that even\r\nrealists were moved by it, some using the motifs with bantering\r\napology--even Dickens and Thackeray, some with rationalistic\r\nexplanation, but practically all using it. Man must and will have the\r\nsupernatural in his fiction. The very elements that one might suppose\r\nwould counteract it,--modern thought, invention, science,--serve as\r\nfeeders to its force. In the inexplicable alchemy of literature almost\r\neverything turns to the unearthly in some form or other.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the various sources from which the Gothic novel drew\r\nits plots, its motifs for ghostly effect. The supernatural fiction\r\nfollowing it still had the same sources on which to draw, and in\r\naddition had various other influences and veins of literary inspiration\r\nnot open to Gothicism. Modern science, with the new miracles of its\r\nlaboratories, proved suggestive of countless plots; the new study of\r\nfolk-lore and the scholarly investigations in that field unearthed an\r\nunguessed wealth of supernatural material; Psychical Research societies\r\nwith their patient and sympathetic records of the forces of the unseen;\r\nmodern Spiritualism with its attempts to link this world to the next;\r\nthe wizardry of dreams studied scientifically,--all suggested new\r\nthemes, novel complications, hitherto unknown elements continuing the\r\nsupernatural in fiction.\r\n\r\nWith the extension of general reading, and the greater range of\r\ntranslations from other languages, the writers of England and America\r\nwere affected by new influences with respect to their use of the\r\nsupernatural. Their work became less insular, wider in its range of\r\nsubject-matter and of technical methods, and in our fiction we find the\r\neffect of certain definite outside forces.\r\n\r\nThe overlapping influences of the Romantic movement in England and\r\nAmerica, France and Germany, form an interesting but intricate study.\r\nIt is difficult to point out marked points of contact, though the\r\ngeneral effect may be evident, for literary influences are usually very\r\nelusive. It is easy to cry, \"Lo, here! lo, there!\" with reference to\r\nthe effect of certain writers on their contemporaries or successors,\r\nbut it is not always easy to put the finger on anything very tangible.\r\nAnd even so, that would not explain literature. If one could point with\r\nabsolute certainty to the source for every one of Shakespeare's plots,\r\nwould that explain his art? Poe wrote an elaborate essay to analyze\r\nhis processes of composition for _The Raven_, but the poem remains as\r\nenigmatic as ever.\r\n\r\nAs German Romanticism had been considerably affected by the Gothic\r\nnovel in England, it in turn showed an influence on later English and\r\nAmerican ghostly fiction. Scott was much interested in the German\r\nliterature treating of evil magic, apparitions, castles in ruins, and\r\nso forth, and one critic says of him that his dealings with subjects\r\nof this kind are midway between Meinhold and Tieck. He was fascinated\r\nwith the German ballads of the supernatural, especially Burger's\r\nghostly _Lenore_, which he translated among others. De Quincey likewise\r\nwas a student of German literature, though he was not so accurate in\r\nhis scholarship as Scott. His horror tale, _The Avengers_, as well as\r\n_Klosterheim_, has a German setting and tone.\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion over the question of Hawthorne's\r\nrelation to German Romanticism. Poe made the charge that Hawthorne drew\r\nhis ideas and style from Ludwig Tieck, saying in a criticism:\r\n\r\n  The fact is, he is not original in any sense. Those who speak of\r\n  him as original mean nothing more than that he differs in his\r\n  manner or tone, and in his choice of subjects, from any author of\r\n  their acquaintance--their acquaintance not extending to the German\r\n  Tieck, whose manner in _some_ of his works is absolutely identical\r\n  with that _habitual_ to Hawthorne.... The critic (unacquainted with\r\n  Tieck) who reads a single tale by Hawthorne may be justified in\r\n  thinking him original.\r\n\r\nVarious critics have discussed this matter with no very definite\r\nconclusions. It should be remembered that Poe was a famous\r\nplagiary-hunter, hence his comments may be discounted. Yet Poe knew\r\nGerman, it is thought, and in his writings often referred to German\r\nliterature, while Hawthorne, according to his journal, read it with\r\ndifficulty and spoke of his struggles with a volume of Tieck.\r\n\r\nHawthorne and Tieck do show certain similarities, as in the use of\r\nthe dream element, the employment of the allegory as a medium for\r\nteaching moral truths, and the choice of the legend as a literary\r\nform. Both use somewhat the same dreamy supernaturalism, yet in style\r\nas in subject-matter Hawthorne is much the superior and improved\r\nwhatever he may have borrowed from Tieck. Hawthorne's vague mystery,\r\ncloudy symbolism, and deep spiritualism are individual in their effect\r\nand give to his supernaturalism an unearthly charm scarcely found\r\nelsewhere. Hawthorne's theme in _The Marble Faun_, of the attaining to\r\na soul by human suffering, is akin to the idea in Fouqué's _Undine_.\r\nThere the supernaturalism is franker, while that of Hawthorne's novel\r\nis more evasive and delicate, yet the same suggestion is present in\r\neach case. Lowell in his _Fable for Critics_ speaks of Hawthorne as \"a\r\nJohn Bunyan Fouqué, a Puritan Tieck.\"\r\n\r\nThere are still more striking similarities to be pointed out between\r\nthe work of Poe and that of E. T. A. Hoffmann. As Hawthorne was, to a\r\nslight extent, at least, affected by German legends and wonder tales,\r\nPoe was influenced by Hoffmann's horror stories. Poe has been called\r\na Germanic dreamer, and various German and English critics mention\r\nthe debt that he owes to Hoffmann. Mr. Palmer Cobb[38] brings out some\r\ninteresting facts in connection with the two romanticists. He says:\r\n\r\n  The verification of Poe's indebtedness to German is to be sought in\r\n  the similarity of the treatment of the same motives in the work of\r\n  both authors. The most convincing evidence is furnished by the way\r\n  in which Poe has combined the themes of mesmerism, metempsychosis,\r\n  dual existence, the dream element, and so forth, in exact agreement\r\n  with the grouping employed by Hoffmann. Notable examples of this\r\n  are the employment of the idea of double existence in conjunction\r\n  with the struggle of good and evil forces in the soul of the\r\n  individual, and the combination of mesmerism and metempsychosis as\r\n  leading motives in one and the same story.\r\n\r\n      [38] _The Influence of E. T. A. Hoffmann on Edgar Allan Poe._\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb points out in detail the similarities between Poe's stories\r\nof dual personality and the German use of the theme as found in\r\nFouqué, Novalis, and Hoffmann, particularly the last. Hoffmann's\r\nexaggerated use of this idea is to be explained on the ground that\r\nhe was obsessed by the thought that his double was haunting him,\r\nand he, like Maupassant under similar conditions of mind, wrote of\r\nsupernaturalism associated with madness. Hoffmann uses the theme of\r\ndouble personality.[39] In Poe's _William Wilson_ the other self is the\r\nembodiment of good, a sort of incarnate conscience, as in Stevenson's\r\nMarkheim, while Hoffmann's _Elixiere_ represents the evil. Poe has here\r\nreversed the idea. In Hoffmann's _Magnetiseur_ we find the treatment\r\nof hypnotism and metempsychosis and the dream-supernaturalism in the\r\nsame combination that Poe uses.[40] Hoffmann[41] and Poe[42] relate the\r\nstory of a supernatural portrait, where the wife-model dies as the\r\nsacrifice to the painting.\r\n\r\n      [39] In the _Doppelgänger_, _Kater Murr_, and _Elixiere des\r\n      Teufels_.\r\n\r\n      [40] In his _Tale of the Ragged Mountains_.\r\n\r\n      [41] In _Die Jesuit-kirche in G._\r\n\r\n      [42] In _The Oval Portrait_.\r\n\r\nBoth Hoffmann and Poe use the grotesquerie of supernaturalism, the\r\nfantastic element of horror that adds to the effect of the ghostly.\r\nEven the generic titles are almost identical.[43] But in spite of\r\nthese similarities in theme and in grouping, there is no basis for a\r\ncharge that Poe owes a stylistic debt to Hoffmann. In his manner he\r\nis original and individual. He uses his themes with much greater art,\r\nwith more dramatic and powerful effect than his German contemporary.\r\nThough he employs fewer of the crude machineries of the supernatural,\r\nhis ghostly tales are more unearthly than Hoffmann's. His horrors have\r\na more awful effect because he is an incomparably greater artist. He\r\nknows the economy of thrills as few have done. His is the genius of\r\ncompression, of suggestion. His dream elements, for instance, though\r\nHoffmann uses the dream to as great extent as Poe--are more poignant,\r\nmore unbearable.\r\n\r\n      [43] Compare Poe's definition of his type as phantasy pieces\r\n      with Hoffmann's title Phantasie Stücke.\r\n\r\nThe cult of horror in German literature, as evidenced in the work of\r\nHoffmann, Kleist, Tieck, Arnim, Fouqué, Chamisso, had an influence\r\non English and American literature of supernaturalism in general.\r\nThe grotesque diablerie, the use of dream elements, magnetism,\r\nmetempsychosis, ghosts, the elixir of life--which theme appears to have\r\na literary elixir of life--are reflected to a certain degree in the\r\nEnglish ghostly tales of the generation following the Gothic romance.\r\n\r\nA French influence is likewise manifest in the later English fiction.\r\nThe Gothic novel had made itself felt in France as well as in\r\nGermany, a proof of which is the fact that Balzac was so impressed by\r\nMaturin's novel that he wrote a sequel to it.[44] The interrelations\r\nof the English, French, and German supernatural literature are\r\nnowhere better illustrated than in the work of Balzac. He admits\r\nHoffmann's inspiration of his _Elixir of Life_, that horrible story\r\nof reanimation, where the head is restored to life and youth but the\r\nbody remains that of an old man, dead and decaying, from which the\r\nhead tears itself loose in the church and bites the abbot to the\r\nbrain, shrieking out, \"Idiot, tell me now if there is a God!\" Balzac's\r\ninfluence over Bulwer-Lytton is seen in such stories as _The Haunters\r\nand the Haunted_, _or the House and the Brain_, and _A Strange Story_,\r\nin each of which the theme of supernaturally continued life is used.\r\nBalzac's _Magic Skin_ is a symbolic story of supernaturalism that\r\nsuggests Hawthorne's allegoric symbolism and may have influenced it\r\nin part. It is a new application of the old theme, used often in\r\nthe drama as in Gothic romance, of the pledge of a soul for earthly\r\ngratification. A magic skin gives the man his heart's desires, yet\r\neach granted wish makes the talisman shrink perceptibly, with an\r\ninexorable decrease. This theme, symbolic of the truth of life, is such\r\na spiritual idea used allegorically as Hawthorne chose frequently and\r\ndoubtless influenced Oscar Wilde's _Picture of Dorian Gray_. Balzac's\r\n_Unknown Masterpiece_ is another example of his supernaturalism that\r\nhas had its suggestive effect on English ghostly fictions.\r\n\r\n      [44] _Melmoth Réconcilié._\r\n\r\nGuy de Maupassant has doubtless influenced English tales of horror\r\nmore than any foreign writer since Hoffmann. As a stylist he\r\nexercised a definite and strong influence over the short-story form,\r\ncondensing it, making it more economical, more like a fatal bullet\r\nthat goes straight to the mark, and putting into a few hundred words\r\na story of supernatural horror relentless in its effect. O. Henry's\r\ndelicately perfect ghost story, _The Furnished Room_, is reminiscent\r\nof Maupassant's technique as seen in _The Ghost_. And surely F. Marion\r\nCrawford's _Screaming Skull_ and Ambrose Bierce's _Middle Toe of the\r\nRight Foot_ are from the same body as Maupassant's _Hand_. What a\r\nterrible corpus it must be! There is the same gruesome mystery, the\r\nsame implacable horror in each story of a mutilated ghost.\r\n\r\nMaupassant's stories of madness, akin to Poe's analyses of mental\r\ndecay, of the slow corruption of the brain, are among his most dreadful\r\ntriumphs of style, and have influenced various English stories of\r\ninsanity. In Maupassant's own tottering reason we find the tragic\r\nexplanation of his constant return to this type of story. Such tales as\r\n_Mad_, where a husband goes insane from doubt of his wife; _Madness_,\r\nwhere a man has a weird power over human beings, animals, and even\r\ninanimate objects, making them do his will, so that he is terrified\r\nof his own self, of what his horrible hands may do mechanically;\r\n_Cocotte_, where the drowned dog, following its master a hundred miles\r\ndown the river, drives him insane; _The Tress_, a curdling story of the\r\nrelation between insanity and the supernatural, so that one is unable\r\nto say which is cause and which effect, illustrate Maupassant's unusual\r\nassociation between madness and uncanny fiction. Who but Maupassant\r\ncould make a story of ghastly hideousness out of a parrot that swears?\r\nAs Maupassant was influenced by Poe, in both subject matter and\r\ntechnique, so he has affected the English writers since his time in\r\nboth plot material and treatment of the supernatural. And as his _La\r\nHorla_ strongly reflects FitzJames O'Brien's _What Was It? A Mystery_\r\nthat anticipated it by a number of years, so it left its inevitable\r\nimpress on Bierce's _The Damned Thing_ and succeeding stories of\r\nsupernatural invisibility. A recent story by Katherine Fullerton\r\nGerould, _Louquier's Third Act_, seems clearly to indicate the De\r\nMaupassant influence, reflecting the method and motifs of _La Horla_\r\nand _The Coward_. Maupassant's tales have a peculiar horror possessed\r\nby few, partly because of his undoubted genius and partly the result of\r\nhis increasing madness.\r\n\r\nOther French writers have also influenced the uncanny story in English.\r\nThéophile Gautier has undoubtedly inspired various tales, such as _The\r\nMummy's Foot_, by Jessie Adelaide Weston, which is the match, though\r\nnot in beauty or form, to his little masterpiece of that title. A.\r\nConan Doyle's _Lot No. 249_, a horrible story of a reanimated mummy,\r\nbears an unquestionable resemblance to Gautier's _The Romance of\r\nthe Mummy_ as well as _The Mummy's Foot_, though Poe's _A Word with\r\na Mummy_, a fantastic story emphasizing the science of miraculous\r\nembalming of living persons so that they would wake to life after\r\nthousands of years, preceded it. Something of the same theme is also\r\nused by F. Marion Crawford,[45] where the bodies in the old studio\r\nawake to menacing life. This motif illustrates the prevalence of the\r\nOriental material in recent English fiction. Gautier's _La Morte\r\nAmoureuse_ has exercised suggestive power over later tales, such as\r\nCrawford's vampire story,[46] though it is significant to recall that\r\nPoe's _Berenice_ preceded Gautier's story by a year, and the latter\r\nmust have known Poe's work.\r\n\r\n      [45] In _Khaled_.\r\n\r\n      [46] _For the Blood Is the Life._\r\n\r\nThe fiction of Erckmann-Chatrian appears to have suggested various\r\nEnglish stories. _The Owl's Ear_ obviously inspired another,[47]\r\nboth being records of supernatural acoustics the latter dealing with\r\nspiritual sounds. _The Invisible Eye_, a fearsome story of hypnotism,\r\nhas an evident parental claim on Algernon Blackwood's story,[48] though\r\nthe latter is psychically more gruesome. _The Waters of Death_, an\r\naccount of a loathsome, enchanted crab, suggests H. G. Wells's story of\r\nthe plant vampire.[49]\r\n\r\n      [47] _The Spider's Eye_, by Lucretia P. Hale.\r\n\r\n      [48] _With Intent to Steal._\r\n\r\n      [49] _The Flowering of the Strange Orchid._\r\n\r\nLikewise Anatole France's _Putois_, the narrative of the man who\r\ncame to have an actual existence because someone spoke of him as an\r\nimaginary person, is associated with the drolleries of supernaturalism,\r\nsuch as are used by Thomas Bailey Aldrich in the story of an imagined\r\nperson, _Miss Mehitabel's Son_, and by Frank R. Stockton.[50] Anatole\r\nFrance has several delicately wrought idylls of the supernatural, as\r\n_The Mass of Shadows_, where the ghosts of those who have sinned for\r\nlove may meet once a year to be reunited with their loved ones, and\r\nin the church, with clasped hands, celebrate the spectral mass, or\r\nsuch tender miracles as _The Juggler of Notre Dame_, where the juggler\r\nthrows his balls before the altar as an act of worship and is rewarded\r\nby a sight of the Virgin, or _Scholasticus_, a symbolic story much\r\nlike one written years earlier by Thomas Bailey Aldrich,[51] where a\r\nplant miraculously springs from the heart of a dead woman. _Amycus and\r\nCelestine_, the story of the faun and the hermit, of whom he tells\r\nus that \"the hermit is a faun borne down by the years\" is suggestive\r\nof the wonderful little stories of Lord Dunsany. Lord Dunsany, while\r\nstartlingly original in most respects, seems a bit influenced by\r\nAnatole France. His _When the Gods Slept_ seems reminiscent of _The\r\nIsle of the Penguins_. In France's satire the gods change penguins into\r\nmen whose souls will be lost, because the priest has baptized them by\r\nmistake, while in Dunsany's story the baboons pray to the Yogis, who\r\npromise to make them men in return for their devotion.\r\n\r\n  And the baboons arose from worshipping, smoother about the face\r\n  and a little shorter in the arms, and went away and hid themselves\r\n  in clothing and herded with men. And men could not discern what\r\n  they were for their bodies were bodies of men though their souls\r\n  were still the souls of beasts and the worship went to the Yogis,\r\n  spirits of ill.\r\n\r\n      [50] In _The Transferred Ghost_ and _The Spectral Mortgage_.\r\n\r\n      [51] _Père Antoine's Date Palm._\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck, influenced by his fellow-Belgian, Charles Van Lerberghe,\r\nwhose _Flaireurs_ appeared before Maeterlinck's plays of the uncanny\r\nand to whom he acknowledges his indebtedness, has strongly affected\r\nghostly literature since his rise to recognition. In his plays we\r\nfind an atmospheric supernaturalism. The settings are of earth, yet\r\nwith an unearthly strangeness, with no impression of realism, of the\r\nfamiliar, the known. In Maeterlinck's plays we never breathe the air of\r\nactuality, never feel the footing of solid earth, as we always do in\r\nShakespeare, even in the presence of ghosts or witches. Shakespeare's\r\nvisitants are ghostly enough, certainly, but the scenes in which they\r\nappear are real, are normal, while in the Belgian's work there is\r\na fluidic supernaturalism that transforms everything to unreality.\r\nWe feel the grip of fate, as in the ancient Greek tragedies, the\r\ninescapable calamity that approaches with swift, silent pace. Yet\r\nMaeterlinck's is essentially static drama. There is very little action,\r\namong the human beings, at least, for Fate is the active agent. In\r\n_The Blind_, _The Intruder_, and _Interior_ the elements are much the\r\nsame, the effects wrought out with the same unearthly manner. But in\r\n_Joyzelle_, which shows a certain similarity to _Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_ and _The Tempest_, we have a different type of supernaturalism,\r\nthe use of enchantment, of fairy magic that comes to a close happily.\r\nIn the dream-drama[52] there is a mixture of realism and poetic\r\nsymbolism, the use of the dream as a vehicle for the supernormal,\r\nand many aspects of the weird combined in a fairy play of exquisite\r\nsymbolism.\r\n\r\n      [52] _The Blue Bird._\r\n\r\nThe influence of Maeterlinck is apparent in the work of English\r\nwriters, particularly of the Celtic school. W. B. Yeats's fairy play,\r\n_The Land of Heart's Desire_, with its pathetic beauty, _Countess\r\nCathleen_, his tragedy of the countess who sells her soul to the devil\r\nthat her people may be freed from his power, as well as his stories,\r\nshow the traces of Maeterlinck's methods. William Sharp, in his\r\nsketches and his brief plays in the volume called _Vistas_, reflects\r\nthe Belgian's technique slightly, though with his own individual\r\npower. Sharp's other literary self, Fiona McLeod, likewise shows\r\nhis influence, as does Synge in his _Riders to the Sea_, and Gordon\r\nBottomley in his _Crier by Night_, that eerie tragedy of an unseen\r\npower. Maeterlinck's supernaturalism seems to suggest the poetry of\r\nColeridge, with its elusive, intangible ghostliness. The effect of\r\nnaïveté observable in Coleridge's work is in Maeterlinck produced\r\nby a child-like simplicity of style, a monosyllabic dialogue, and a\r\nmonotonous, unreasoning repetition that is at once real and unreal.\r\nThe dramatist has brought over from the poet the same suggestive use\r\nof portents and symbols for prefiguring death or disaster that lurks\r\njust outside. The ghostliness is subtle, rather than evident, the drama\r\nstatic rather than dynamic.\r\n\r\nIbsen, also, has strongly influenced the supernatural in both our\r\ndrama and our fiction. His own work has a certain kinship with that of\r\nHawthorne, showing a like symbolism and mysticism, a like transfusion\r\nof the unreal with the natural, so that one scarcely knows just how\r\nfar he means our acceptance of the unearthly to extend. He leaves it\r\nin some cases an open question, while in others he frankly introduces\r\nthe supernatural. The child's vision of the dead heroes riding to\r\nValhalla, with his own mother who has killed herself, leading them,[53]\r\nthe ghost that tries to make an unholy pact with the king,[54] the\r\napparition and the supernatural voice crying out \"He is the God of\r\nLove!\"[55] illustrate Ibsen's earlier methods. The curious, almost\r\ninexplicable _Peer Gynt_, with its mixture of folk-lore and symbolism,\r\nits ironic laughter and satiric seriousness, seems to have had a\r\nsuggestive influence on other works, such as _Countess Eve_,[56] where\r\nthe personification of temptation in the form of committed sin reflects\r\nIbsen's idea of Peer Gynt's imaginary children. The uncanny power of\r\nunspoken thought, the haunting force of ideas rather than the crude\r\nvisible phantasms of the dead, as in the telepathy, or hypnotism,\r\nor what you will, in _The Master Builder_, the evasive, intangible\r\nhaunting of the living by the dead as in _Rosmersholm_, the strange\r\npowers at work as in _The Lady from the Sea_, have had effect on the\r\nnumerous psychic dramas and stories in English. The symbolic mysticism\r\nin _Emperor and Galilean_, showing the spirits of Cain and of Judas,\r\nwith their sad ignorance of life's riddles, the vision of Christ in\r\nperson, with His unceasing power over men's souls, foreshadowed the\r\nplays and stories bringing in the personality of Christ, as _The\r\nServant in the House_, and _The Passing of the Third Floor Back_.\r\n\r\n      [53] In _The Vikings of Helgeland_.\r\n\r\n      [54] In _The Pretenders_.\r\n\r\n      [55] In _Brand_.\r\n\r\n      [56] By J. H. Shorthouse.\r\n\r\nModern Italian literature, as represented by Fogazzaro and D'Annunzio,\r\nintroduces the ghostly in fiction and in the drama, and has had its\r\neffect on our literature. Fogazzaro's novels are essentially realistic\r\nin pattern, yet he uses the supernatural in them, as in miraculous\r\nvisions,[57] and metempsychosis and madness associated with the\r\nsupernatural.[58] D'Annunzio's handling of the unearthly is more\r\nrepulsive, more psychically gruesome, as the malignant power of the\r\nancient curse in _La Città Morta_, where the undying evil in an old\r\ntomb causes such revolting horror in the action of the play. This has\r\na counterpart in a story,[59] by Josephine Daskam Bacon, where a\r\npacket of letters from two evil lovers lie buried in a hearth and by\r\ntheir subtle influence corrupt the soul of every woman who occupies the\r\nroom. D'Annunzio uses the witch motive powerfully,[60] madness that\r\nborders on the supernatural,[61] and the idea of evil magic exorcised\r\nby melting an image of wax to cause an enemy's death[62] which suggests\r\nRossetti's poem using that incident, the unforgettable _Sister Helen_.\r\n\r\n      [57] In _The Sinner_ and _The Saint_.\r\n\r\n      [58] In _The Woman_.\r\n\r\n      [59] _The Unburied._\r\n\r\n      [60] In _The Daughter of Jorio_.\r\n\r\n      [61] In _Sogno d'un Mattino di Primavera_.\r\n\r\n      [62] In _Sogno d'un Tramonto d'Autunno_.\r\n\r\nLikewise a new force in the work of the Russian school has affected our\r\nfiction of the ghostly in recent years. Russian literature is a new\r\nfield of thought for English people, since it is only of late years\r\nthat translations have been easily accessible, and, because of the\r\nextreme difficulty of the language, very few outsiders read Russian.\r\nAs German Romanticism began to have its definite power over English\r\nsupernatural fiction in the early part of the nineteenth century by the\r\nextension of interest in and study of German literature, and the more\r\nfrequent translation of German works, so in this generation Russian\r\nliterature has been introduced to English people and is having its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nA primitive, still savage race like the Russians naturally shows a\r\nspecial fondness for the supernatural. Despite the fact that literature\r\nis written for the higher classes, a large peasant body, illiterate\r\nand superstitious, will influence the national fiction. In the Russian\r\nworks best known to us there is a large element of the uncanny, of a\r\ntype in some respects different from that of any other country. Like\r\nthe Russian national character, it is harsh, brutal, violent, yet\r\nsentimental. One singular thing to be noted about it is the peculiar\r\ncombination of supernaturalism with absolute realism. The revolting\r\nyet dreadfully effective realism of the Russian literature is never\r\nmore impressive than in its union with ghostly horror, which makes the\r\nimpossible appear indubitable. In Gogol's _The Cloak_, for instance,\r\nthe fidelity to homely details of life, the descriptions of pinching\r\npoverty, of tragic hopes that waited so long for fulfillment, are\r\npainful in themselves and give verisimilitude to the element of the\r\nunearthly that follows. You feel that a poor Russian clerk who had\r\nstinted himself from necessity all his life _would_ come back from the\r\ndead to claim his stolen property and demand redress. The supernatural\r\ngains a new power, a more tremendous thrill when set off against the\r\nevery-dayness of sordid life. We find something of the same effect in\r\nthe stories of Algernon Blackwood and Ambrose Bierce and F. Marion\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nTolstoi's symbolic story of _Ivan the Fool_ is an impressive utterance\r\nof his views of life, expressed by the allegory of man's folly and\r\nwisdom and the schemes of devils.\r\n\r\nTurgeniev's pronounced strain of the unearthly has had its influence\r\non English fiction. He uses the dream elements to a marked degree, as\r\nin _The Song of Love Triumphant_, a story of Oriental magic employed\r\nthrough dreams and music, and _The Dream_, an account of a son's\r\nrevelatory visions of his unknown father. The dream element has\r\nbeen used considerably in our late fiction, some of which seems to\r\nreflect Turgeniev. Another motive that he uses effectively is that\r\nof suggested vampirism,[63] and of psychical vampirism,[64] where a\r\nyoung man is \"set upon\" by the spirit of a dead woman he has scarcely\r\nknown, till he dies under the torment. This seems to have affected\r\nsuch stories as that of psychical vampirism in _The Vampire_, by\r\nReginald Hodder. We find in much of Turgeniev's prose the symbolic,\r\nmystical supernaturalism besides his use of dreams, visions, and a\r\ndistinct Oriental element. In _Knock! Knock! Knock!_ the treatment\r\nof whose spiritualism reminds one somewhat of Browning's,[65] in\r\nits initial skepticism and later hesitation, the final effect of\r\nwhich is to impress one with a sense of supernaturalism working\r\nextraordinarily through natural means, so that it is more powerful than\r\nthe mere conventional ghostly could be, we see what may have been the\r\ninspiration for certain spiritualistic novels and stories in English.\r\nThe same tone is felt in Hamlin Garland's treatment of the subject,\r\nfor instance. The mystical romanticism of Turgeniev is less brutally\r\nRussian than that of most of his compeers.\r\n\r\n      [63] As in _Phantoms_.\r\n\r\n      [64] As in _Clara Militch_.\r\n\r\n      [65] In _Sludge, the Medium_.\r\n\r\nLike Maupassant and Hoffman and Poe, the Russian writers use to\r\na considerable extent the association between insanity and the\r\nsupernatural to heighten the effect of both. They may have been\r\ninfluenced in this by Poe's studies of madness, as by Maupassant's,\r\nand they appear to have an influence over certain present-day writers.\r\nIt would be difficult to say which is the stronger influence in the\r\ntreatment of abnormal persons, Maupassant or the Russian writers.\r\nOne wonders what type of mania obsesses certain of the Russian\r\nfictionists of to-day, for surely they cannot be normal persons.\r\nExamples of such fiction are: Alexander Pushkin's story of mocking\r\nmadness resulting from a passion for cards, whose ghostly motif has a\r\nsardonic diabolism,[66] Tchekhoff's story of abnormal horror,[67] a\r\nracking account of insanity,[68] and _The Black Monk_, a weird story of\r\ninsanity brought on by the vision of a supernatural being, a replicated\r\nmirage of a black monk a thousand years old. But it is in the work of\r\nLeonidas Andreyev that we get the ultimate anguish of madness. _The\r\nRed Laugh_, an analysis of the madness of war, of the insanity of\r\nnations as of individuals, seems to envelop the world in a sheet of\r\nflame. Its horrors go beyond words and the brain reels in reading.\r\nThere are in English a number of stories of insanity associated with\r\nthe supernatural which may have been influenced by the Russian method,\r\nthough Ambrose Bierce's studies in the abnormality of soldier life\r\npreceded Andreyev by years. F. Marion Crawford's _The Dead Smile_ and\r\nvarious stories of Arthur Machen have a Russian horror, and other\r\ninstances might be mentioned.\r\n\r\n      [66] _The Queen of Spades._\r\n\r\n      [67] _Sleepyhead._\r\n\r\n      [68] _Ward No. 6._\r\n\r\nThe Russian fiction with its impersonality of pessimism, its racial\r\ngloom, its terrible sordid realism forming a basis for awesome\r\nsupernaturalism, is of a type foreign to our thought, yet, as is not\r\ninfrequently the case, the radically different has a strange appeal,\r\nand the effect of it on our stories of horror is undoubted. English and\r\nAmerican readers are greatly interested in Russian literature just now\r\nand find a peculiar relish in its terrors, though the harsher elements\r\nare somewhat softened in transference to our language.\r\n\r\nOther fields of thought have been opened to us within this generation\r\nby the widening of our knowledge of the literature of other European\r\ncountries. Books are much more freely translated now than formerly\r\nand no person need be ignorant of the fiction of other lands. From\r\nthe Spanish, the Portuguese, the Chinese, Japanese, and other tongues\r\nwe are receiving stories of supernaturalism that give us new ideas,\r\nnew points of view. The greater ease of travel, the opportunity to\r\nstudy once-distant lands and literatures have been reflected in our\r\nfiction. Some one should write a monograph on the literary influence of\r\nCook's tours! Our later work has a strong touch of the Oriental,--not\r\nan entirely new thing, since we find it in Beckford's _Vathek_ and\r\nthe pre-Gothic tales of John Hawkesworth,--but more noticeable now.\r\nExamples are Stevenson's _New Arabian Nights_, _Bottle Imp_, and\r\nothers, F. Marion Crawford's _Khaled_ and _Mr. Isaacs_, Blackwood's\r\nstories of Elementals, George Meredith's fantasy, _The Shaving of\r\nShagpat_, though many others might be named. The Oriental fiction\r\npermits the use of magic, sorcery, and various elements that seem out\r\nof place in ordinary fiction. The popularity of Kipling's tales of\r\nIndian native life and character illustrates our fondness for this\r\naspect of supernaturalism.\r\n\r\nApart from the foreign influences that affect it we notice a certain\r\nchange in the materials and methods of ghostly fiction in English. New\r\nelements had entered into Gothic tales as an advance over the earlier\r\nforms, yet conventions had grown up so that even such evasive and\r\nelusive personalities as ghosts were hidebound by precedent. While\r\nthe decline of the _genre_ definitely known as the Gothic novel in\r\nno sense put an end to the supernatural in English fiction, it did\r\nmark a difference in manner. The Gothic ghosts were more elementary\r\nin their nature, more superficial, than those of later times. Life\r\nwas, in the days of Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe, more local because\r\nof the limitations of travel and communication, it being considered\r\nastounding in Gothic times that a ghost could travel a thousand miles\r\nwith ease while mortals moved snail-like. Scientific investigation was\r\ncrude compared with the present and had not greatly touched fiction.\r\nScientific folk-lore investigations were as unknown as societies of\r\npsychical research, hence neither had aided in the writing of ghostly\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nThe mass of ghostly stuff which has appeared in English since the\r\nGothic period, and which will be classified and discussed under\r\ndifferent motifs in succeeding chapters, shows many of the same\r\ncharacteristics of the earlier, yet exhibits also a decided development\r\nover primitive, classical and Gothic forms. The modern supernaturalism\r\nis more complex, more psychological than the terroristic, perhaps\r\nbecause nowadays man is more intellectual, his thought-processes more\r\nsubtle. Humanity still wants ghosts, as ever, but they must be more\r\ncleverly presented to be convincing. The ghostly thrill is as ardently\r\ndesired by the reading public, as eagerly striven for by the writers\r\nas ever, though it is more difficult of achievement now than formerly.\r\nYet when it is attained it is more poignant and lasting in its effects\r\nbecause more subtle in its art. The apparition that eludes analysis\r\nhaunts the memory more than do the comparatively simple forms of the\r\npast. Compare, for instance, the spirits evoked by Henry James and\r\nKatherine Fullerton Gerould with the crude clap-trap of cloistered\r\nspooks and armored knights of Gothic times. How cheap and melodramatic\r\nthe earlier attempts seem!\r\n\r\nThe present-day ghost is at once less terrible and more terrible than\r\nthose of the past. There is not so much a sense of physical fear now,\r\nas of psychic horror. The pallid specters that glide through antique\r\ncastles are ineffectual compared with the maleficent psychic invasions\r\nof modernity. On the other hand, the recent ghostly story frequently\r\nshows a strong sense of humor unknown in Gothicism, and only suggested\r\nin earlier forms, as in the elder Pliny's statement that ghosts would\r\nnot visit a person afflicted with freckles, which shows at least a\r\ngerminal joviality in classical spooks.\r\n\r\nOne feature that distinguishes the uncanny tales of to-day from the\r\nGothic is their greater range of material. The early terror story had\r\nits source in popular superstition, classical literature, medieval\r\nlegends, or the Elizabethan drama, while in the century that has\r\nelapsed since the decay of the Gothic novel as such, new fields of\r\nthought have been opened up, and new sources for ghostly plots have\r\nbeen discovered which the writers of modern stories are quick to\r\nutilize. Present-day science with its wonderful development has\r\nprovided countless plots for supernatural stories. Comparative study\r\nof folk-lore, with the activities of the numerous associations, has\r\nbrought to light fascinating material. Modern Spiritualism, with its\r\nseances, its mediumistic experiments, has inspired many novels and\r\nstories. The Psychical Research Society, with branches in various parts\r\nof the world and its earnest advocates and serious investigations, has\r\ncollected suggestive stuff for many ghostly stories. The different\r\nsources for plot material and mechanics for awesome effect, added\r\nto these from which the terror novel drew its inspiration, have\r\nincalculably enriched the supernatural fiction and widened the limits\r\nfar beyond the restrictions of the conventionalized Gothic.\r\n\r\nScience has furnished themes for many modern stories of the\r\nsupernatural. Modern science itself, under normal conditions, seems\r\nlike necromancer's magic, so its incursion into thrilling fiction\r\nis but natural. Every aspect of research and discovery has had its\r\nexponent in fictive form, and the skill with which the material is\r\nhandled constitutes one point of difference between the present ghostly\r\nstories and the crude scientific supernaturalism of the early novels.\r\nThe influence of Darwin, Spencer, Huxley, and other scientists of the\r\nlast century did much to quicken fiction as well as thought, and the\r\neffects can be traced in the work of various authors.\r\n\r\nThe widespread interest in folk-lore in recent years has had an\r\nappreciable influence on the stories of the supernatural. While the\r\nmethods of investigation followed by the serious students of folk-lore\r\nare scientific and the results are tabulated in an analytic rather than\r\na literary style, yet the effect is helpful to fiction. Comparative\r\nstudies in folk-lore, by the bringing together of a mass of material\r\nfrom diverse sources, establishes the fact of the universal acceptance\r\nof supernaturalism in some form. Ethnic superstitions vary, yet there\r\nis enough similarity between the ideas held by tribes and races so\r\nwidely separated as to discredit any basis of imitation or conscious\r\ninfluence between them, to be of great interest to scientists. No\r\ntribe, however low in the social scale, has been found that has no\r\nbelief in powers beyond the mortal.\r\n\r\nFolk-lore associations are multiplying and the students of literature\r\nand anthropology are joining forces in the effort to discover and\r\nclassify the variant superstitions and legends of the past and of the\r\nraces and tribes still in their childhood. Such activities are bringing\r\nto light a fascinating wealth of material from which the writers of\r\nghostly tales may find countless plots. Such studies show how close\r\nakin the world is after all. A large number of books relating stories\r\nof brownies, bogles, fairies, banshees, wraiths, hobgoblins, witches,\r\nvampires, ghouls, and other superhuman personages have appeared. I\r\nam not including in this list the fairy stories that are written for\r\njuvenile consumption, but merely the folk-loristic or literary versions\r\nfor adults.\r\n\r\nThe most marked instance of the influence of folk-lore in supplying\r\nsubject matter for literature is shown in the recent Celtic revival.\r\nThe supernatural elements in the folk-tales of Ireland, Scotland,\r\nand Wales have been widely used in fiction, poetry, and the drama.\r\nIn this connection one is reminded of Collins's _Ode on the Popular\r\nSuperstitions of the Highlands Considered as the Subject for Poetry_.\r\nThe Irish National School, with W. B. Yeats, John Synge, and Lady\r\nGregory as leaders, have made the folk-tales of Ireland live in\r\nliterature and the ghostly thrill of the old legends comes down to us\r\nundiminished. Lord Dunsany's work is particularly brilliant, going back\r\nto ancient times and re-creating the mythologic beings for us, making\r\nus friendly with the gods, the centaurs, the giants, and divers other\r\nlong-forgotten characters. Kipling has made the lore of the Indian\r\ntowns and jungles live for us, as Joel Chandler Harris has immortalized\r\nthe legends of the southern negro. Thomas A. Janvier in his tales of\r\nold Mexico calls back the ghosts of Spanish conquerors and Aztec men\r\nand women, repeopling the ancient streets with courtly specters. The\r\nfondness for folk-loristic fiction is one of the marked aspects of\r\nRomanticism at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Society for Psychical Research have had decided\r\neffect in stimulating ghostly stories. When so many intelligent persons\r\nturn their attention to finding and classifying supernatural phenomena\r\nthe currents of thought thus set up will naturally influence fiction.\r\nNowadays every interest known to man is reflected in literature. The\r\nproceedings of the association have been so widely advertised and so\r\nopen to the public that persons who would not otherwise give thought\r\nto the supernatural have considered the matter. Such thinkers as W. T.\r\nStead and Sir Oliver Lodge, to mention only two, would inevitably\r\ninfluence others. In this connection it is interesting to note the\r\nrecent claims by Stead's daughter that her father has communicated\r\nwith the living, and Lodge's book, just published, _Raymond, or Life\r\nand Death_, that gives proof of what he considers incontrovertible\r\nmessages from his son killed in battle. The collection of thousands of\r\naffirmative answers to the question as to whether one had ever felt a\r\nghostly presence not to be explained on natural grounds brought out a\r\nmass of material that might serve for plot-making. Haunted houses have\r\nbeen catalogued and the census of specters taken.\r\n\r\nThe investigations in modern Spiritualism have done much to affect\r\nghostly literature. The terrors of the later apparitions are not\r\nphysical, but psychical, and probably the stories of the future will\r\nbe more and more allied to Spiritualism. Hamlin Garland, John Corbin,\r\nWilliam Dean Howells, Algernon Blackwood, Arnold Bennett, and others\r\nhave written novels and stories of this material, though scarcely the\r\nfringe of the garment of possibilities has yet been touched. If one\r\nbut grant the hypothesis of Spiritualism, what vistas open up for the\r\nnovelist! What thrilling complications might come from the skillful\r\nmanipulation of astrals alone,--as aids in establishing alibis, for\r\ninstance! Even the limitations that at present bind ghost stories\r\nwould be abolished and the effects of the dramatic employment of\r\nspiritualistic faith would be highly sensational. If the will be all\r\npowerful, then not only tables but mountains may be moved. The laws\r\nof physics would be as nothing in the presence of such powers. A\r\nlovelorn youth bent on attaining the object of his desires could, by\r\nmerely willing it so, sink ocean liners, demolish skyscrapers, call\r\nup tempests, and rival German secret agents in his havoc. Intensely\r\ndramatic psychological material might be produced by the conflict\r\nresulting from the double or multiple personalities in one's own\r\nnature, according to spiritualistic ideas. There might be complicated\r\ncrossings in love, wherein one would be jealous of his alter ego, and\r\nconflicting ambitions of exciting character. The struggle necessary for\r\nthe model story might be intensely dramatic though altogether internal,\r\nbetween one's own selves. One finds himself so much more interesting in\r\nthe light of such research than one has ever dreamed. The distinctions\r\nbetween materializations and astralizations, etherealizations and plain\r\napparitions might furnish good plot structure. The personality of the\r\n\"sensitives\" alone would be fascinating material and the cosmic clashes\r\nof will possible under these conceived conditions suggest thrilling\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nDreams constitute another definite source for ghostly plots in modern\r\nliterature. While this was true to a certain extent in the Gothic\r\nnovel, it is still more so in later fiction. Lafcadio Hearn[69]\r\nadvances the theory that all the best plots for ghost stories in any\r\nlanguage come from dreams. He advises the person who would write\r\nsupernatural thrillers to study the phases of his own dream life.\r\nIt would appear that all one needs to do is to look into his own\r\nnightmares and write. Hearn says: \"All the great effects produced\r\nby poets and story writers and even by religious teachers, in the\r\ntreatment of the supernatural fear or mystery, have been obtained\r\ndirectly or indirectly from dreams.\" Though one may not literally\r\naccept the whole of that statement, one must feel that the relation\r\nbetween dreams and supernatural impressions is strikingly close. The\r\nfeeling of supernatural presence comes almost always at night when\r\none is or has been asleep. The guilty man, awaking from sleep, thinks\r\nthat he sees the specters of those he has wronged--because his dreams\r\nhave embodied them for him. The lover beholds the spirit of his dead\r\nlove, because in dreams his soul has gone in search of her. Very young\r\nchildren are unable to distinguish between dreams and reality, as is\r\nthe case of savages of a low order, believing in the actuality of what\r\nthey experience in dreams. And who can say that our dream life is\r\naltogether baseless and unreal?\r\n\r\n      [69] In his _Interpretations of Literature_.\r\n\r\nThe different nightmare sensations, acute and vivid as they are, can be\r\nanalyzed to find parallelisms between them and the ghostly plots. For\r\nexample, take the sensation, common in nightmares, of feeling yourself\r\nfalling from immeasurable height. The same thrill of suspense is\r\ncommunicated by the climax in Lewis's and Mrs. Dacre's Gothic novels,\r\nwhere the devil takes guilty mortals to the mountain top and hurls\r\nthem down, down. The horrible potentialities of shadows suggested\r\nfrequently in dreams is illustrated by Mary Wilkins Freeman's story\r\nwhere the accusing spirit comes back as a haunting shadow on the wall,\r\nrather than as an ordinary ghost, tormenting the living brother till\r\n_his_ shadow also appears, a portent of his death.[70] The awful grip\r\nof causeless horror, of nameless fear which assails one so often in\r\nnightmares is represented in _The Red Room_,[71] where black Fear, the\r\nPower of Darkness, haunts the room rather than any personal spirit. It\r\nis disembodied horror itself. Wilkie Collins illustrates the presaging\r\nvision of approaching disaster in _The Dream Woman_. The nightmare\r\nhorror of supernaturalism is nowhere better shown than in Maupassant's\r\n_La Horla_ where the sleeper wakes with a sense of leaden weight upon\r\nhis breast, and knows that night after night some dreadful presence\r\nis shut in with him, invisible yet crushing the life out of him and\r\ndriving him mad.\r\n\r\n      [70] _The Shadows on the Wall._\r\n\r\n      [71] By H. G. Wells.\r\n\r\nThe nightmare motifs are present to a remarkable degree in\r\nBulwer-Lytton's _The Haunted and the Haunters, or the House and\r\nthe Brain_. There we have the gigantism of the menacing Thing, the\r\nsupernatural power given to inanimate objects, the ghostly chill, the\r\ndarkness, and the intolerable oppression of a nameless evil thing\r\nbeside one. Vampirism might easily be an outcome of dreams, since\r\nbased on a physical sensation of pricking at the throat, combined with\r\ndebility caused by weakness, which could be attributed to loss of blood\r\nfrom the ravages of vampires. F. Marion Crawford's story, _For the\r\nBlood Is the Life_, is more closely related to dreams than most of the\r\ntype, though probably Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ is the most horrible.\r\n\r\nThe curious side of supernaturalism as related to dreams is illustrated\r\nby _The Dream Gown of the Japanese Ambassador_,[72] and the more\r\nbeautiful by Simeon Solomon's _Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep_. Mary\r\nWilkins Freeman has a remarkable short story, _The Hall Bedroom_,\r\nwhich is one of the best illustrations of the use of dream imagery\r\nand impressions. Here the effects are alluring and beautiful, with\r\nthe horror kept in the background, but perhaps the more effective\r\nbecause of the artistic restraint. Odors, sights, sounds, feelings,\r\nare all raised to an intensity of sensuous, slumbrous enjoyment,\r\nall subliminated above the mortal. The description of the river in\r\nthe picture, on which the young man floats away to dreamy death,\r\nsimilar to the Japanese story referred to by Hearn, helps to give the\r\nimpression of infinity that comes only in dreams. Algernon Blackwood in\r\nnumerous stories not only uses the elements of dreams and nightmares\r\nbut explicitly calls attention to the fact. Dream supernaturalism is\r\nemployed in Barry Pain's stories, in Arthur Machen's volume,[73] and in\r\nmany others. Freud's theory of dreams as the invariable result of past\r\nexperiences or unconscious desires has not been stressed in fiction,\r\nthough doubtless it will have its inning presently. A. Conan Doyle's\r\n_The Secret of Goresthorpe Grange_ is an amusing story of the relation\r\nof definite wishes and dreams of the ghostly.\r\n\r\n      [72] By Brander Matthews.\r\n\r\n      [73] _The Hill of Dreams._\r\n\r\nThese are some of the sources from which the later writers of occultism\r\nhave drawn their plots. They represent a distinct advance over the\r\nGothic and earlier supernaturalism in materials, for the modern story\r\nhas gained the new elements without loss of the old. The ghostly\r\nfiction of to-day has access to the animistic or classical or medieval\r\nthemes, yet has the unlimited province of present thought to furnish\r\nadditional inspiration. There never was a time when thinking along\r\ngeneral lines was more spontaneously reflected in fiction than now,\r\nand supernatural literature claims all regions for its own. Like every\r\nother phase of man's thought, ghostly fiction shows the increasing\r\ncomplexity of form and matter, the wealth of added material and\r\nabounding richness of style, the fine subtleties that only modernity\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMODERN GHOSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ghost is the most enduring figure in supernatural fiction. He\r\nis absolutely indestructible. He glides from the freshly-cut pages\r\nof magazines and books bearing the date of the year of our Lord\r\nnineteen hundred and seventeen as from the parchment rolls of ancient\r\nmanuscripts. He appears as unapologetically at home in twentieth\r\ncentury fiction as in classical mythology, Christian hagiology,\r\nmedieval legend, or Gothic romance. He changes with the styles in\r\nfiction but he never goes out of fashion. He is the really permanent\r\ncitizen of this earth, for mortals, at best, are but transients. Even\r\nthe athlete and the Methusaleh must in the end give up the flesh,\r\nbut the wraith goes on forever. In form, too, he wears well. Ghostly\r\nsubstance of materialization, ethereal and vaporous as it appears\r\nto be, is yet of an astonishing toughness. It seems to possess an\r\nobstinate vitality akin to that attributed to the boll weevil in a\r\nnegro ballad, that went on undaunted by heat or cold, rain or drought,\r\ntime or tide. The ghost, like death, has all seasons for its own and\r\nthere is no closed season for spooks. It is much the case now as ever\r\nthat all the world loves a ghost, yet we like to take our ghosts\r\nvicariously, preferably in fiction. We'd rather see than be one.\r\n\r\nOne point of difference between the ghostly fiction of the past and\r\nof the present is in the matter of length. The Gothic novel was\r\noften a three- or four-decker affair in whose perusal the reader aged\r\nperceptibly before the ghost succeeded or was foiled in his haunting\r\ndesigns. There was obviously much more leisure on the part of spooks as\r\nwell as mortals then than now. Consequently the ghost story of to-day\r\nis told in short-story form for the most part. Poe knew better than\r\nanybody before him what was necessary for the proper economy of thrills\r\nwhen he gave his dictum concerning the desirable length for a story,\r\nwhich rule applies more to the ghostly tale than to any other type, for\r\nsurely there is needed the unity of impression, the definiteness of\r\neffect which only continuity in reading gives. The ghostly narrative\r\nthat is too long loses in impressiveness, whether it is altogether\r\nsupernatural or mixed with other elements. In either case, it is less\r\nsuccessful than the shorter, more poignant treatment possible in the\r\ncompressed form. The tabloid ghost can communicate more thrills than\r\nthe one in diluted narration.\r\n\r\nThe apparitions in later English fiction fall naturally into several\r\ndistinct classes with reference to the reality of their appearance.\r\nThere are the mistaken apparitions, there are the purely subjective\r\nspecters, evoked by the psychic state of the percipients, and there are\r\nthe objective ghosts, independent of the mental state of the witnesses,\r\nappearing to persons who are not mentally prepared to see them.\r\n\r\nThe mistaken ghost is an old form, for most of Mrs. Radcliffe's\r\ninteresting apparitions belong to this class and others of the Gothic\r\nwriters used subterfuge to cheat the reader. In the early romance\r\nthere was frequently deliberate deception for a definite purpose, the\r\nghosts with the histrionic temperament using a make-up of phosphorus,\r\nbones, and other contrivances to create the impression of unearthly\r\nvisitation. Recent fiction is more cleverly managed than that. Rarely\r\nnow does one find a story where the ghost-seer is deliberately imposed\r\nupon, for in most modern cases the mistake occurs by accident or\r\nmisapprehension on the part of the percipient, for which nobody and\r\nnothing but his own agitation is responsible. Yet there are occasional\r\nhoax ghosts even yet, for example, _The Ghost of Miser Brimpson_,[74]\r\nwhere a specter is rigged up as the scheme of a clever girl to win over\r\nan obdurate lover, and _The Spectre Bridegroom_, which is a well-known\r\nexample of the pseudo-spook whose object is matrimony. _His Unquiet\r\nGhost_[75] is a delightful story of a fake burial to evade the revenue\r\nofficials. Watt, the \"corp,\" says: \"I was a powerful onchancy, onquiet\r\nghost. I even did my courtin' whilst in my reg'lar line o' business\r\na'harntin' a graveyard!\" His sweetheart sobs out her confession of love\r\nto \"his pore ghost,\" an avowal she has denied the living man. Examples\r\nof the apparitions that unwittingly deceive mortals are found in _The\r\nGhost at Point of Rock_,[76] where the young telegraph operator, alone\r\nat night on a prairie, sees a beautiful girl who enters and announces\r\nthat she is dead,--how is he to know that she is in a somnambulistic\r\nstupor, and has wandered from a train? Another is[77] a story where the\r\nyoung man falls in love with what he thinks is a wraith of the water\r\nluring him to his death, but learns that she is a perfectly proper\r\ndamsel whose family he knows. _The Night Call_[78] is less simple than\r\nthese, a problematic story that leaves one wondering as to just what is\r\nmeant.[79]\r\n\r\n      [74] By Eden Phillpotts.\r\n\r\n      [75] By Charles Egbert Craddock.\r\n\r\n      [76] By F. H. Spearman.\r\n\r\n      [77] _By the Waters of Paradise_, by F. Marion Crawford.\r\n\r\n      [78] By Henry Van Dyke.\r\n\r\n      [79] As Dr. Blanche Williams points out in her discussion of\r\n      the short story.\r\n\r\nThe subjective ghosts are legion in modern fiction. They are those\r\nevoked by the mental state of the percipients so that they become\r\nrealities to those beholding them. The mind rendered morbid by grief\r\nor remorse is readily prepared to see the spirits of the dead return\r\nin love or with reproach. The apparitions in animistic beliefs, as in\r\nclassical stories and Gothic romance, were usually subjective, born\r\nof brooding love or remorse or fear of retribution, appearing to the\r\npersons who had cause to expect them and coming usually at night when\r\nthe beholders would be alone and given over to melancholy thought or\r\nelse to troubled sleep. Shakespeare's ghosts were in large measure\r\nsubjective, \"selective apparitions.\" When Brutus asked the specter what\r\nhe was, the awful answer came, \"Thy evil genius, Brutus!\" Macbeth saw\r\nthe witches who embodied for him his own secret ambitions, and he alone\r\nsaw the ghost of Banquo, because he had the weight of murder on his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe subjective ghost story is difficult to write, as the effect must\r\nbe subtly managed yet inescapably impressive. If done well it is\r\nadmirable, and there are some writers who, to use Henry James's words\r\nconcerning his own work, are \"more interested in situations obscure and\r\nsubject to interpretation than the gross rattle of the foreground.\" The\r\nreader, as well as the writer, must put himself in the mental attitude\r\nof acceptance of the supernatural else the effect is lacking, for the\r\nghostly thrill is incommunicable to those beyond the pale of at least\r\ntemporary credulity.\r\n\r\nKipling's _They_ is an extraordinary ghost story of suggestion rather\r\nthan of bald fact. It is like crushing the wings of a butterfly to\r\nanalyze it, but it represents the story of a man whose love for his own\r\ndead child enabled him to see the spirits of other little children,\r\nbecause he loved. As the blind woman told him, only those who were\r\nspiritually prepared could see them, for \"you must bear or lose!\"\r\nbefore glimpsing them. Thomas Bailey Aldrich's _Miss Mehitabel's Son_\r\nis a humorously pathetic account of the subjective spirit of a child\r\nthat was never born. Algernon Blackwood's ghosts are to a great extent\r\nsubjective. As John Silence, the psychic doctor, says to the shuddering\r\nman who has had a racking experience: \"Your deeply introspective mood\r\nhad already reconstructed the past so intensely that you were _en\r\nrapport_ at once with any forces of those past days that chanced to\r\nbe still lingering. And they swept you up all unresistingly.\" In _The\r\nShell of Sense_,[80] the woman who is about to accept her dead sister's\r\nhusband feels such a sense of disloyalty that she sees the sister's\r\nspirit reproaching her. Her conscience has prepared her for the vision.\r\nJuliet Wilbur Tompkins shows us the spirit of a mother returning to\r\ncomfort the daughter who has in life misunderstood and neglected her,\r\nbut now, realizing the truth, is grieving her heart out for her.[81]\r\nAmbrose Bierce tells of a prisoner who murders his jailer to escape,\r\nbut is arrested and brought back by the spirit of the dead man.[82] Any\r\nnumber of instances might be given of ghosts appearing to those who are\r\nmentally prepared to be receptive to supernatural visions, but these\r\nwill serve to illustrate the type.\r\n\r\n      [80] By Olivia Howard Dunbar.\r\n\r\n      [81] _They That Mourn._\r\n\r\n      [82] _An Arrest._\r\n\r\nObjective ghosts are likewise very numerous in modern fiction. The\r\nobjective spirits are those that, while they may be subjective on the\r\npart of the persons chiefly concerned, to begin with, are yet visible\r\nto others as well, appearing not only to those mentally prepared\r\nto see them but to others not thinking of such manifestations and\r\neven sceptical of their possibility. The objective ghosts have more\r\ndefinite visibility, more reality than the purely subjective spirits.\r\nThey are more impressive as haunters. There is a plausibility, a\r\ncorporeality about the later apparitions that shows their advance over\r\nthe diaphanous phantoms of the past. Ghosts that eat and drink, play\r\ncards, dance, duel, and do anything they wish, that are so lifelike in\r\ntheir materialization that they would deceive even a medium, are more\r\nterrifying than the helpless specters of early times that could only\r\ngive orders for the living to carry out. The modern ghost has lost none\r\nof his mortal powers but has gained additional supermortal abilities,\r\nwhich gives him an unsportsmanlike advantage over the mere human being\r\nhe may take issue with.\r\n\r\nHenry James's _The Turn of the Screw_ is a remarkable example of\r\nthe objective ghost story. It is one of the best ghostly stories\r\nin English, because more philosophical, showing more knowledge of\r\nthe psychology not only of the adult but of the child, not only of\r\nthe human being but of the ghost, than most fiction of the type.\r\nPeter Quint and Miss Jessel with their diabolical conspiracy of evil\r\nagainst the two children are so real that they are seen not only by\r\nthe children they hound but by the unsuspecting governess as well.\r\nShe is able to describe them so accurately that those who knew them\r\nin life--as she did not at all--recognize them instantly. In _The\r\nFour-fifteen Express_,[83] John Derringer's ghost is seen by a man that\r\ndoes not know he is dead, and who has not been thinking of him at all.\r\nThe ghost reveals incontrovertible proof of his presence, even leaving\r\nhis cigar-case behind him,--which raises the question as to whether\r\nghosts smoke in the hereafter in more ways than one. The ghastly\r\nincident in Emily Brontë's _Wuthering Heights_ where the agonized\r\nghost comes to the window, gashing its wrist on the broken pane, is\r\nstrikingly objectified, for she comes to a person who never knew her\r\nand is not thinking of any supernatural manifestation. _Shadows on the\r\nWall_,[84] that story of surpassing power of suggestion, is objective\r\nin its method, for not only the man who has wronged his dead mother\r\nsees his spirit returning, not in the ordinary way but as an accusing\r\nshadow on the wall, but the sisters see it as well.\r\n\r\n      [83] By Amelia B. Edwards.\r\n\r\n      [84] By Mary Wilkins Freeman.\r\n\r\nIn _John Inglesant_,[85] the spirit of Lord Strafford is seen by the\r\nyoung lad in the vestibule as well as by the king whose conscience\r\nburns for having left him to die undefended. Frank R. Stockton's\r\ntransferred ghost is an objective apparition, for surely the guest in\r\nthe upper chamber was not expecting to see the shade of a living man\r\nperch itself on the foot of his bed at midnight. The horrible specter\r\nin _The Messenger_,[86] is seen by various persons at different times,\r\nsome of whom are totally unprepared for such exhibition. And many\r\nsimilar instances might be given.\r\n\r\n      [85] By J. H. Shorthouse.\r\n\r\n      [86] By Robert W. Chambers.\r\n\r\nWhether ghosts be mistaken, subjective or objective, their appearance\r\nhas always elicited considerable interest on the part of humanity.\r\nTheir substance of materialization, their bearing, dress, and general\r\ndemeanor are matters of definite concern to those who expect shortly\r\nto become ghosts themselves. In some instances the modern ghost\r\nsticks pretty closely to the animistic idea of spirit material, which\r\nwas that the shade was a sort of vapory projection of the body,\r\nintangible, impalpable, yet easily recognized with reference to\r\nprevious personality. Chaucer describes some one as being \"nat pale as\r\na forpyned goost,\" which illustrates the conception in his day, and the\r\nGothic specimen was usually a pallid specter, though Walpole furnished\r\none robust haunter of gigantic muscle. Yet for the most part the Gothic\r\nghosts were misty wraiths, through which the sword could plunge without\r\nresistance. They were fragile and helpless as an eighteenth-century\r\nheroine when it came to a real emergency, and were useful chiefly for\r\nfrightening the guilty and consoling the innocent. In some stories of\r\nthe present we have a similar materialization. The spirit woman in\r\nKipling's _Phantom Rickshaw_ is so ethereal that the horse and its\r\nrider plunge through her without resistance, and Dickens's Mr. Marley\r\nis of such vapory substance that Scrooge can see clear through him\r\nto count the coat-tail buttons at his back. In a recent story, _The\r\nSubstitute_,[87] the spirit is said to evade her friend like a mist.\r\n\r\n      [87] By Georgia Wood Pangborn.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic ghost frequently walked forth as a skeleton, clad in nothing\r\nbut his bones and a lurid scowl. Skeletons still perambulate among us,\r\nas in _The Messenger_, where the stripped-off mask shows a hideous\r\nskull.\r\n\r\n  The skeleton burst from out the rotting robes and collapsed on the\r\n  ground before us. From between the staring ribs and the grinning\r\n  teeth spurted a torrent of black blood, showering the shrinking\r\n  grasses, and then the thing shuddered and fell over into the black\r\n  ooze of the bog.\r\n\r\nThe ghost of Zuleika[88] is described as \"a skeleton woman robed in the\r\nragged remains of a black mantle. Near this crumbling earth body there\r\nlay the spirit of Zuleika attached to it by a fine thread of magnetic\r\nether. Like the earthly body it was wrapped in a robe of black of which\r\nit seemed the counterpart.\" Elliott O'Donnell has a story of a mummy\r\nthat in a soldier's tent at night sobs, breathes, moves, sits up, and\r\nwith ghastly fingers unfolds its cere-cloth wrappings, appearing to him\r\nas the counterpart of his long-dead mother, looking at him with the\r\neyes he had worshiped in his boyhood.\r\n\r\n  I fell on my knees before her and kissed--what? Not the feet of my\r\n  mother but those of the long-buried dead! Sick with repulsion and\r\n  fear I looked up and there bending over me and peering into my eyes\r\n  was the face, the fleshless, mouldering face of the foul corpse!\r\n\r\n      [88] In _Ahrinziman_, by Anita Silvani.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, though skeletons do appear in later fiction, the\r\nrattle of bones is not heard as often as in Gothic times.\r\n\r\nGhostly apparitions are more varied in form than in early times. The\r\nmodern ghost does not require a whole skeleton for his purposes, but he\r\ncan take a single bone and put the hardiest to flight with it. It is\r\na dreadful thing to realize that a ghost can come in sections, which\r\nindefinitely multiplies its powers of haunting. F. Marion Crawford has\r\na story of a diabolical skull, one of the most rabid revenge ghosts on\r\nrecord. A man has murdered his wife by pouring melted lead into her\r\near while she slept, in accordance with a suggestion from a casually\r\ntold story of a guest. The dead woman's skull--the husband cut the\r\nhead off for fear people would hear the lead rattle, and buried it in\r\nthe garden--comes back to haunt the husband, with that deadly rattle\r\nof the lump of lead inside. The teeth bite him, the skull rolls up a\r\nhill to follow him, and finally kills him, then sets in to haunt the\r\nvisitor who told the suggestive story.[89] Elsewhere as well Crawford\r\nshows us skulls that have uncanny powers of motion and emotion. In\r\nWilkie Collins's _Haunted Hotel_ the specter is seen as a bodiless head\r\nfloating near the ceiling of the room where the man was murdered and\r\nhis body concealed. Thackeray[90] describes a ghost with its head on\r\nits lap, and of course every one will remember the headless horseman\r\nwith his head carried on the pommel of his saddle that frightened poor\r\nIchabod Crane out of his wits.\r\n\r\n      [89] _The Screaming Skull._\r\n\r\n      [90] In _A Notch on the Axe_.\r\n\r\nWe get a rabble of headless apparitions in _Brissot's Ghost_, one\r\nof the Anti-Jacobin parodies (ridiculing Richard Glover's ballad of\r\nHosier's Ghost):\r\n\r\n    Sudden up the staircase sounding\r\n      Hideous yells and shrieks were heard;\r\n    Then, each guest with fear confounding,\r\n      A grim train of ghosts appeared;\r\n    Each a head in anguish gasping\r\n      (Himself a trunk deformed with gore)\r\n    In his hand, terrific clasping,\r\n      Stalked across the wine-stained floor.\r\n\r\nIn Bulwer-Lytton's _The Haunters and the Haunted_ a woman's hand\r\nwithout a body rises up to clutch the ancient letters, then withdraws,\r\nwhile in his _Strange Story_ the supernatural manifestation comes as\r\na vast Eye seen in the distance, moving nearer and nearer, \"seeming\r\nto move from the ground at a height of some lofty giant.\" Then other\r\nEyes appear. \"Those Eyes! Those terrible Eyes! Legions on legions! And\r\nthat tramp of numberless feet! _they_ are not seen, but the hollows of\r\nthe earth echo to their tread!\" The supernatural phenomena in Ambrose\r\nBierce's stories have an individual horror. In _A Vine on the House_ he\r\nshows a hideous revenge ghost manifested in a peculiar form. A couple\r\nof men take refuge in a deserted house and note a strange vine covering\r\nthe porch that shakes unaccountably and violently. In mystification\r\nthey dig it up, to find the roots in the form of a woman's body,\r\nlacking one foot, as had been the case with the woman who had lived\r\nthere and whose husband had killed her secretly and buried her beside\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\nThe revenge ghost in modern fiction frequently manifests itself in this\r\nform, mutilated or dismembered, each disfigurement of the mortal body\r\nshowing itself in a relentless immortality and adding to the horror\r\nof the haunting. There seems to be no seat of ghostly mind or soul,\r\nfor the body can perform its function of haunting in whole or in part,\r\nunaided by the head or heart, like a section of a snake that has life\r\napart from the main body. And this idea of detached part of the form\r\nacting as a determined agent for revenge adds a new horror to fiction.\r\nI haven't as yet found an instance of a woman's heart, bleeding and\r\nbroken, coming up all by itself to haunt the deserting lover, but\r\nperhaps such stories will be written soon. And think what terrors would\r\nawait the careless physician or surgeon if each outraged organ or\r\ndismembered limb came back to seek vengeance on him!\r\n\r\nGhosts of modern fiction are more convincing in their reality than the\r\nspecters of early times. They are stronger, more vital; there seems\r\nto be a strengthening of ghostly tissue, a stiffening of supernatural\r\nmuscle in these days. Ghosts are more healthy, more active, more alive\r\nthan they used to be. There is now as before a strong resemblance to\r\nthe personality before death, the same immortality of looks that is\r\ndiscouraging to the prospects of homely persons who have hoped to\r\nbe more handsome in a future state. Fiction gives no basis for such\r\nhope. Peculiarities of appearance are carried over with distressing\r\nfaithfulness to detail, each freckle, each wrinkle, each gray\r\nhair showing with the clearness of a photographic proof. Note the\r\nlifelikeness of the governess's description of Peter Quint in _The Turn\r\nof the Screw_.\r\n\r\n  He has red hair, very red, very close-curling, and a pale face,\r\n  long in shape, with straight, good features and little queer\r\n  whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are somehow\r\n  darker and particularly arched as if they might move a good deal.\r\n  His eyes are sharp, strange, awful. His mouth is wide, his lips\r\n  thin.\r\n\r\nThis seems an unspectral description, for red hair is not wraith-like,\r\nyet a red-headed ghost that lifted its eyebrows unnaturally would be\r\nalarming. She says of him: \"He was absolutely, on this occasion, a\r\nliving, dangerous, detestable presence.\"\r\n\r\nEach minor disfigurement is retained, as the loss of the tooth in\r\nCrawford's screaming skull, the missing toe in Bierce's _Middle Toe of\r\nthe Right Foot_, the lacking foot in the ghostly vine, and so forth.\r\nNothing is neglected to make identification absolute in present tales\r\nof horror. The spirits described by Bram Stoker have red, voluptuous\r\nlips and pink cheeks, and the spirit of Sir Oliver's mother, in De\r\nMorgan's _An Affair of Dishonor_, that comes to meet him as he passes\r\nher mausoleum on his way to the shameful duel, limps as in life, so\r\nthat he recognizes her, though the cloaked and hooded figure has its\r\nface turned from him. Jessie Adelaide Middleton shows us one ghost with\r\nhalf a face.\r\n\r\nGhostly apparel constitutes an interesting feature of supernaturalism\r\nin literature. There seem to be as definite conventions concerning\r\nspectral clothes as regarding the garb of the living fashionables. It\r\nis more difficult to understand the immortality of clothes than of\r\nhumanity, for bodily tissue even of ghosts might quite conceivably\r\nrenew itself, but not so with the ghostly garments. Of what stuff are\r\nghost-clothes made? And why do they never wear out?\r\n\r\nIn olden times when people wore clothes of less radical styles than\r\nnow and fewer of them, masculine spirits were in part identified by\r\ntheir familiar armor. Armor is so material and heavy that it seems\r\nincongruous to the ghostly function, yet shields and accouterments were\r\nnecessary accompaniments of every knightly spook. He must be ever ready\r\nto tilt with rival ghost. The Gothic phantoms were well panoplied and\r\none remembers particularly the giant armor in Walpole's novel. Nowadays\r\nthe law forbids the carrying of weapons, which restriction seems to\r\nhave been extended to ghostdom as well. Specters are thus placed at a\r\ndisadvantage, for one would scarcely expect to see even the wraith of a\r\nTexas cow-boy toting a pistol.\r\n\r\nSpecters usually appear in the garments in which the beholder saw them\r\nlast in life. Styles seem petrified at death so that old-time ghosts\r\nnow look like figures from the movies or guests at a masquerade ball.\r\nOne other point to be noted is that women phantoms are frequently seen\r\nin black or in white. White seems reminiscent of the shroud, as well as\r\nof youth and innocence, so is appropriate, while black connotes gloom,\r\nso is suitable, yet the really favored color is gray. Most of the\r\nspecters this season are dressed in gray. I scarcely know why this is\r\naffected by shades, yet the fact remains that many wraiths both men and\r\nwomen are thus attired. Gray is the tone that witches of modern tastes\r\nchoose also, whereas their ancient forbears went in black and red.\r\nModern ghosts are at a disadvantage in the matter of clothes compared\r\nwith the earlier ones, since the styles now change so quickly and so\r\ndecidedly that a ghost is hopelessly _passé_ before he has time to\r\nmaterialize at all in most instances.\r\n\r\nExamples of ghostly garments in later fiction evidence their variety.\r\nKatherine Fullerton Gerould[91] shows us three ghosts, one of a woman\r\nin a blue dress, one of a rattlesnake, and one of a Zulu warrior\r\nwearing only a loin-cloth, a nose-ring, and a scowl. (We do not\r\noften see the nude in ghosts, perhaps because they have a shade of\r\nmodesty.) _Co-operative Ghosts_[92] depicts a man clad in the wraith\r\nof a tweed suit, mid-Victorian, \"with those familiar Matthew Arnold\r\nside-whiskers.\" In addition to Mr. Morley's coat-tail buttons which\r\nwe glanced through him to see, we observe that he wears ghostly\r\nspectacles, a pig-tail, tights and boots, and a prim waist-coat. In\r\nKipling's _They_ we see the glint of a small boy's blue blouse, while\r\nanother Kipling youngster, a war-ghost,[93] struts around in his\r\ncomical first trousers which he would not be robbed of even by the\r\nGerman soldiers that murdered him. Other children in the same story\r\nare said to have on \"disgracefully dirty clothes.\" I do not recall any\r\nsoilure on Gothic garments, save spectral blood-stains and the mold\r\nof graves. Neither did I discover any child wraith in Gothicism save\r\nthe pitiful spirits of baby victims in _The Albigenses_ and the baby\r\nwraiths in Hogg's _The Wool-gatherer_. The Englishman driven mad by\r\nthe apparition of the woman he has wronged in Kipling's story[94] is\r\ndescribed by him as \"wearing the dress in which I saw her last alive;\r\nshe carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand and the same\r\ncard-case in her left.\" (A woman eight months dead with a card-case!)\r\nBlackwood shows us a ghost in purple knee-breeches and velvet coat;\r\nin _The Gray Guest_[95] the returning Napoleon wears a long military\r\ncloak of gray and military boots, while Crawford has one dreadful ghost\r\ncoming back to wreak revenge in wet oil-skins. The eccentric spook in\r\nJosephine Daskam Bacon's _The Heritage_ is dressed in brown and sits\r\nstolidly and silently on the side of the bed with its back turned.\r\nThink of being haunted by an unbudging brown back! No wonder it drove\r\nthe young husband to spend his wedding night huddled on the stairs. We\r\nhave instances of a ghost in a red vest, a relentless revenge spirit\r\nthat hounds from ocean to ocean his murderer and the betrayer of his\r\ndaughter, and another of a ghost in a red shirt. There is on the whole\r\nas much variety and appropriateness of costume in modern ghost fiction\r\nas in Broadway melodrama.\r\n\r\n      [91] In _On the Stairs_.\r\n\r\n      [92] By F. Converse.\r\n\r\n      [93] In _Swept and Garnished_.\r\n\r\n      [94] _Phantom Rickshaw._\r\n\r\n      [95] By Laurence Clarke.\r\n\r\nAnother point of difference between the specters of to-day and those\r\nof the past is in the extension of their avenues of approach to us.\r\nGhostly appeal to the senses is more varied now than in earlier times.\r\nThe classical as well as the Gothic ghosts appealed in general only to\r\nthe sight and hearing, as well as, of course, to the sixth sense that\r\nrealizes the presence of a supernatural being. Ghosts were seen and\r\nheard and were content with that. But nowadays more points of contact\r\nare open to them and they haunt us through the touch, the smell, as\r\nwell as sight and hearing. The taste as a medium of impression has\r\nnot yet been exploited by fiction writers though doubtless it will be\r\nworked out soon. There is a folk-tale of the Skibos that wolves eat\r\nghosts and find them very appetizing and the devil in Poe's _Bon Bon_\r\nsays he eats the spirits of mortals. One might imagine what haunting\r\ndyspepsia could result if an ill-tempered spook were devoured against\r\nhis will. It is conceivable, too, that gastronomic ghosts might haunt\r\ncannibals; and who knows that the dark brown taste in the mouths of\r\nriotous livers is not some specter striving to express itself through\r\nthat medium instead of being _merely_ riotous livers?\r\n\r\nThe appeal of ghosts to the sight has already been discussed so\r\nneed not be mentioned here. But the element of invisibility enters\r\nin as a new and very terrible form of supernatural manifestation\r\nin later fiction. In spite of the general visibility, some of the\r\nmost horrible tales turn on the fact that the haunter is unseen.\r\nH. G. Wells's _Invisible Man_ is a human being, not a ghost; yet the\r\nstory has a curdling power that few straight ghost stories possess.\r\nMaupassant's _La Horla_ is a nightmare story of an invisible being\r\nthat is terrific in its effect. The victim knows that an unseen\r\nyet definite and determined something is shut in his room with him\r\nnight after night, eating, drinking, reading, sitting on his chest,\r\ndriving him mad. Ambrose Bierce's _The Damned Thing_ is a gruesome\r\nstory of invisibility, of a something that is abroad with unearthly\r\npower of evil, whose movements can be measured by the bending of the\r\ngrasses, which shuts off the light from other objects as it passes,\r\nwhich struggles with the dogs and with men, till it finally kills\r\nand horribly mangles the man who has been studying it, but is never\r\nseen. Another[96] has for its central figure a being that violently\r\nattacks men and is overpowered and tied only by abnormal strength,\r\nthat struggles on the bed, showing its imprint on the mattress, that\r\nis imprisoned in a plaster cast to have its mold taken, that is heard\r\nbreathing loudly till it dies of starvation, yet is absolutely never\r\nvisible. Blackwood's Fire Elemental may be seen moving along only by\r\nthe bending of the grass beneath it and by the trail it leaves behind,\r\nfor though it is audible yet it is never seen. As a brave man said of\r\nit, \"I am not afraid of anything that I can _see_!\" so these stories\r\nof supernatural invisibility have a chilling horror more intense than\r\nthat of most ghostly tales. The element of invisibility of unmistakably\r\npresent spirits is shown in other stories.\r\n\r\n      [96] _What Was It? A Mystery_, by Fitz-James O'Brien.\r\n\r\nOne tender story of an invisible ghost is told in _In No Strange\r\nLand_,[97] of a man killed suddenly in a wreck while on his way home\r\nto the birthday dinner his wife is preparing for him. He does not know\r\nthat he has been hurt; but while his dead body lies mangled under the\r\nwreckage his spirit hurries home. He swears whimsically under his\r\nbreath at some interruption and thinks with joy of the happy little\r\ngroup he will meet. But when he enters his home he cannot make them see\r\nor hear him. They are vaguely aware of some strange influence, are awed\r\nby it, and the little son with the poet's heart whispers that he hears\r\nsomething, but that is all. The man stands by, impotently stretching\r\nout his arms to them till he hears the messenger tell them that he is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n      [97] By Katherine Butler.\r\n\r\nGhosts are variable with respect to sounds as well as appearance. The\r\nearly ghosts were for the most part silent, yet could talk on occasion,\r\nand classical apparitions were sometimes vocal and sometimes silent.\r\nThe Gothic ghost sometimes had an impediment in his speech while at\r\nother times he could converse fluently. The Gothic specter, real as\r\nwell as faked, frequently lifted voice in song and brought terror to\r\nthe guilty bosom by such strains. Yet when he spoke he was usually\r\nbrief in utterance. Perhaps the reason for that lay in the lack of\r\nsurety on the part of the writers as to the proper ghostly diction.\r\nGothic authors were not overstrong on technique and they may have\r\nhesitated to let their specters be too fluent lest they be guilty of\r\ndialectic errors. It would seem incongruous for even an illiterate\r\nghost to murder the king's English, which presents a difficulty in the\r\nmatter of realism, so perchance the writers dodged the issue by giving\r\ntheir ghosts brevity of speech, or in some cases by letting them look\r\nvolumes of threats but utter no word. This may explain the reason for\r\nthe non-speaking ghosts in classical and Elizabethan drama. There is\r\na similar variation in the later fiction, for many of the ghosts are\r\neloquently silent, while other phantoms are terrifyingly fluent. All\r\nthis goes to prove the freedom of the modern ghost for he does what he\r\ntakes a notion to do. The invisible ghosts are as a rule voiceless as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic romance was fond of mysterious music as an accompaniment of\r\nsupernatural visitation, but ghostly music is less common than it used\r\nto be. Yet it does come at times, as in _A Far-away Melody_,[98] where\r\ntwo spinster sisters living alone hear heavenly music as portent of\r\ntheir death. Ghostly song is heard in another case,[99] where a woman's\r\nspirit comes back to sing in a duet at her funeral, and Crawford's\r\nghost[100] constantly whistles a tune he had been fond of during\r\nlife. In _Co-operative Ghosts_ the wraith of the young girl who in\r\nCromwellian times betrayed her father's cause to save her lover's life\r\nsings sadly,\r\n\r\n    \"I could not love thee, dear, so much,\r\n        Loved I not honor more!\"\r\n\r\n      [98] By Mary Wilkins Freeman.\r\n\r\n      [99] _Two Voices._\r\n\r\n      [100] In _Man Overboard_.\r\n\r\nIn Crawford's _A Doll's Ghost_, that peculiar example of preternatural\r\nfiction, not a children's story as one might think, nor yet humorous,\r\nthe mechanical voice of the doll and the click of its tiny pattering\r\nfeet occur as strange sounds. Lord Strafford[101] walks with a firm,\r\naudible tread on his way to appall the king, and in Blackwood's _Empty\r\nHouse_ the ghosts move with sounds of heavy, rushing feet, followed\r\nby a noise of scuffling and smothered screams as the ancient murder\r\nis re-enacted, then the thud of a body thrown down the stairs,--after\r\nwhich is a terrible silence. The awful effect of a sudden silence\r\nafter supernatural sounds is nowhere shown more tensely than in _The\r\nMonkey's Paw_,[102] that story of superlative power of suggestion. When\r\nthe ghostly visitant knocks loudly at the outer door, we feel the same\r\nthrill of chilling awe as in the knocking at the gate in Macbeth, and\r\nmore, for the two who hear are sure that this is a presence come back\r\nfrom the dead. Then when the last magic wish has been breathed, utter\r\nsilence comes, a silence more dreadful in its import than the clamor\r\nhas been.\r\n\r\n      [101] In _John Inglesant_.\r\n\r\n      [102] By W. W. Jacobs.\r\n\r\nNew sounds are introduced in modern ghostly tales, such as the peculiar\r\nhissing that is a manifestation of the presence of the ancient\r\nspirit[103] followed by the crackling and crashing of the enchanted\r\nflames. In Blackwood's _Keeping His Promise_ the heavy, stertorous\r\nbreathing of the invisible Thing is heard, and the creaking of the\r\nbed weighted down by the body. Mary Wilkins Freeman brings in ghostly\r\ncrying in a story, while Blackwood speaks of his Wendigo as having \"a\r\nsort of windy, crying voice, as of something lonely and untamed, wild\r\nand of abominable power.\" Kipling introduces novel and touching sounds\r\nin his stories of ghostly children. The child-wraiths are gay, yet\r\nsometimes near to tears. He speaks of \"the utterly happy chuckle of a\r\nchild absorbed in some light mischief,\" \"sudden, squeaking giggles of\r\nchildhood,\" \"the rustle of a frock and the patter of feet in the room\r\nbeyond,\" \"joyous chuckles of evasion,\" and so forth. These essentially\r\nchildlike and lifelike sounds are deeply pathetic as coming from the\r\nghosts of little ones that hover, homesick, near the earth they dread\r\nto leave. The little ghost boy in Richard Middleton's story,[104]\r\nmanifests himself, invisibly, through the little prancing steps, the\r\nrustling of the leaves through which he runs, and the heart-breaking\r\nimitations of an automobile. Later ghostly fiction introduces few of\r\nthe clankings of chains and lugubrious groans that made the Gothic\r\nromance mournful, and the modern specters are less wailful than the\r\nearlier, but more articulate in their expression. There are definite\r\nghostly sounds that recur in various stories, such as the death-rap\r\nabove the bed of the dying, the oft-mentioned mocking laughter in\r\nempty places, the cry of the banshee which is the presage of death not\r\nonly of the body but of the soul, as well. On the whole, the sounds\r\nin modern supernatural stories are more varied in their types, more\r\nexpressive of separate and individual horror, and with an intensified\r\npower of haunting suggestion than was the case with the earlier forms.\r\n\r\n      [103] In _A Nemesis of Fire_, by Blackwood.\r\n\r\n      [104] _The Passing of Edward._\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell was not noticeably exploited in the ancient or\r\nGothic ghost stories, though certain folk-tales, as Hawaiian stories\r\nof the lower world, speak of it. The devil was supposed to be in bad\r\nodor, for he was usually accompanied by sulphurous scents, as we notice\r\nin Calderon's drama,[105] and some of the Gothic novels, but that seems\r\nto be about the extent of the matter. But moderns, while not so partial\r\nto brimstone, pay considerable attention to supernatural odors. The\r\ndevil has been dry-cleaned, but the evil odors of later fiction are\r\nmore objectionable than the fumes of the pit, are more variant, more\r\nindividual and distinctive. Odors seem less subjective than sights\r\nor sounds, and are not so conventionalized in ghostly fiction, hence\r\nwhen they are cleverly evoked they are unusually effective. These\r\nsupernatural scents have a very lasting quality too, for they linger on\r\nafter the other manifestations of the preternatural are past. In _The\r\nHaunted Hotel_,[106] the ghost manifests itself through the nostrils.\r\nIn room number thirteen there is an awful stench for which no one can\r\naccount, and which cannot be removed by any disinfectants. Finally\r\nwhen a woman especially sympathetic to a man mysteriously dead is put\r\nin the room, the ghost appears as a decaying head, floating near the\r\nceiling and emitting an intolerable odor. _The Upper Berth_[107] tells\r\nof a strange, foul sea odor that infests a certain stateroom and that\r\nno amount of fumigating or airing will remove. As the Thing comes out\r\nof the sea to carry its victim away with it, the man in the lower\r\nberth gets the full force of the unearthly smell. There are definite\r\nfoul supernatural odors associated with supernatural animals in recent\r\nghostly tales, as that \"ghost of an unforgettable strange odor, of a\r\nqueer, acrid, pungent smell like the odor of lions,\" which announces\r\nthe presence of the awful out-door something called by the Indians, the\r\nWendigo. In Kipling's story[108] of a man whose soul has been stolen\r\nby Indian magic through the curse of a leper priest and a beast's soul\r\nput in its place,--his companions are sickened by an intolerable stench\r\nas of wild beasts, and when the curse is removed and he comes back to\r\nhimself, he sniffs the air and asks what causes \"such a horrid doggy\r\nsmell in the air.\"\r\n\r\n      [105] _El Magico Prodigioso._\r\n\r\n      [106] By Wilkie Collins.\r\n\r\n      [107] By F. Marion Crawford.\r\n\r\n      [108] _The Mark of the Beast._\r\n\r\nSometimes the ghastly presence comes as a whiff of perfume,[109] where\r\nthe spirit of the dead woman brings with it flowers in masses, with a\r\nheavenly perfume which lingers after the spirit in visible form has\r\ndeparted. The subtlest and most delicately haunting story of this type\r\nis O. Henry's,[110] where the loved, dead girl reveals herself to the\r\nman who is desperately hunting the big city over for her, merely as a\r\nwhiff of mignonette, the flower she most loved.\r\n\r\n      [109] As in _Here and There_, by Alice Brown.\r\n\r\n      [110] _The Furnished Room._\r\n\r\nBut it is through the sense of touch that the worst form of haunting\r\ncomes. Seeing a supernatural visitant is terrible, hearing him is\r\ndireful, smelling him is loathsome, but having him touch you is the\r\nclimax of horror. This element comes in much in recent stories. The\r\nearlier ghosts seemed to be more reserved, to know their spectral place\r\nbetter, were not so ready to presume on unwelcome familiarities as\r\nthose in later fiction, but spooks have doubtless followed the fashion\r\nof mortals in this easy, relaxed age and have become a shade too free\r\nin their manners. Of course, one remembers the crushing specter in\r\nOtranto castle that flattened the hapless youth out so effectually,\r\nand there are other instances less striking. But as a general thing\r\nthe Gothic ghost was content to stand at a distance and hurl curses.\r\nFortunately for our ancestors' nerves, he did not incline much to the\r\nlaying on of hands. Modern ghosts, however, have not been taught to\r\nrestrain their impulses and they venture on liberties that Radcliffian\r\nromance would have disapproved of.\r\n\r\n_The Damned Thing_ gives an example of muscular supernaturalism, for\r\nthe mysterious being kills a dog in a stiff fight, then later slays the\r\nmaster after a terrible struggle in which the man is disfigured beyond\r\nwords to describe. O'Brien shows a terrible being of abnormal power\r\nthat is tied only after a tremendous effort, and which fights violently\r\nto free itself. And the Thing in the upper berth had an awesome\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n  It was something ghostly, horrible, beyond words, and it moved in\r\n  my grasp. It was like the body of a man long dead and yet it moved,\r\n  and had the strength of ten men living, but I gripped it with all\r\n  my might, the slippery, oozy, horrible thing. I wrestled with the\r\n  dead thing; it thrust itself upon me and nearly broke my arms; it\r\n  wound its corpselike arms around my neck, the living death, and\r\n  overpowered me, so that at the last I cried aloud and fell and left\r\n  my hold.\r\n\r\n  As I fell the thing sprang across me and seemed to throw itself\r\n  upon the captain. When I last saw him on his feet his face was\r\n  white and his lips set. It seemed to me that he struck a violent\r\n  blow at the dead being, and then, he, too, fell forward on his face.\r\n\r\nThe ghostly touch is frequently described, not only in fiction but in\r\nreports of the Psychical Society as well, as being of supernatural\r\nchill or of burning heat. _Afterwards_[111] brings in the icy touch of\r\nthe spirit hand. In certain cases the ghost touch leaves a burn or mark\r\nthat never goes away.\r\n\r\n      [111] By Fred C. Smale.\r\n\r\nYet the touch of horror is not the only one introduced in fiction\r\nof the supernatural. There are tender and loving touches as well,\r\nexpressing yearning love and a longing to communicate with the living.\r\nWhat could be more beautiful than the incident in _They_? \"I felt\r\nmy relaxed hand taken and turned softly between the soft hands of a\r\nchild. The little brushing kiss fell in the center of my palm--as gift\r\non which the fingers were _once_ expected to close--a fragment of a\r\nmute code devised very long ago.\" And in a similar story,[112] the\r\nwoman says, \"I will swear to my dying day that two little hands stole\r\nand rested--for a moment only--in mine!\" Wilkie Collins speaks of his\r\nstory, _The Ghost's Touch_, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The course of this narrative leads the reader on new and strange\r\n  ground. It describes the return of a disembodied spirit to\r\n  earth--not occurring in the obscurity of midnight but in the\r\n  searching light of day; neither seen as a vision nor heard as a\r\n  voice--revealing itself to mortal knowledge through the sense that\r\n  is least easily self-deceived, the sense that feels.\r\n\r\n      [112] _A Pair of Hands_, by Quiller-Couch.\r\n\r\nThe widow feels the clasp of her husband's hands, not only psychically\r\nbut physically, and when she asks for a further sign, the ghost kisses\r\nher unmistakably on the lips. Another widow[113] feels her hand clasped\r\nby the hand of her husband who has mysteriously disappeared after\r\nhaving presumably absconded with trust funds--and knows that he is dead\r\nand seeking to give her some message. His hand gently leads her to the\r\nedge of the cliff where he has fallen over and been killed, so that she\r\nmay know the truth. The lover in Poe's _Eleonora_ feels a \"spiritual\r\nkiss\" from the lips of his beloved. The ghost touch is an impressive\r\nmotif of strength in recent fiction and marks an advance over the\r\nearlier forms, showing an access of imaginative power and psychological\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n      [113] In _Our Last Walk_, by Hugh Conway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother point of contrast between the modern and the older ghosts is\r\nin the greater freedom enjoyed by those of to-day. The ghosts of our\r\nancestors were weak and helpless creatures in the main and the Gothic\r\nspecter was tyrannized over to such an extent that he hardly dared\r\ncall his shade his own. The spook of to-day has acquired a latchkey\r\nand asserted his independence. He may have a local habitation but he\r\nisn't obliged to stay there. Now-a-days even the spectral women are\r\nsetting up to be feminists and have privileges that would have caused\r\nthe Gothic wraiths to swoon with horror. Ghosts are not so sensitive to\r\nthe barometer now as they used to be, nor do they have such an active\r\ninfluence over the weather as did the Gothic phantoms. They do not\r\nneed a tempest for their materialization nor a supernatural play of\r\nlightning for their wild threats, and comparatively few storms occur\r\nin later fiction. Yet there is certainly no lessening of the ghostly\r\nthrill in consequence.\r\n\r\nNeither are the spirits of to-day limited to any set hours as was the\r\nrule in Gothicism. The tyranny of the dark, the autocratic rule of\r\ntwelve or one o'clock as the arbitrary hour for apparitions, has been\r\nremoved. Katherine Fullerton Gerould shows an interesting collection\r\nof ghosts that come at eleven o'clock in the morning, Georgia Wood\r\nPangborn brings one out on the seashore in mid-afternoon, and Kipling\r\nhas various ghosts that appear in daylight and in the open air.\r\n\r\nGhosts in modern fiction are not dependent upon a setting of sullen\r\nscenery as in Gothicism, but may choose any surroundings they like.\r\nSince modern household arrangements do not include family vaults as\r\na general thing, and since cemeteries are inconveniently located,\r\nthere is a tendency on the part of haunters to desert such quarters.\r\nMary Wilkins Freeman and Charles Egbert Craddock each has one ghost\r\nstory located in a graveyard, and _The Last Ghost in Harmony_[114]\r\nis set in a burying-ground, but the specter complains loudly of the\r\nunsentimental mind of the town which has lost interest in ghosts, and\r\nleaves in disgust. Likewise the domination of the Gothic castles, those\r\n\"ghaist-alluring edifices,\" has passed away and modern spooks are not\r\nconfined to any one locality as in the past. They appear where they\r\nwill, in the most prosaic places, in cheap lodging-houses, in hall\r\nbedrooms, in bungalows, in the staterooms of steamers, on tramp ships,\r\nand so forth. Algernon Blackwood has set a number of thrilling ghost\r\nstories out in the open, in the woods, in the desert sand wastes, and\r\nsimilar places. One effect of such realistic and unspectral setting\r\nis to give a greater verisimilitude to the events described, and the\r\nmodern tale bears out Leigh Hunt's suggestion that \"a ghost story, to\r\nbe a good one, should unite, as much as possible, objects as they are\r\nin life, with a preternatural spirit.\" Yet here are ghosts that do\r\nhaunt certain rooms as relentlessly as ever Gothic specter did.\r\n\r\n      [114] By N. M. Lloyd.\r\n\r\nThe modern ghost has power over certain localities rather than mere\r\nhouses or apartments. If the house he calls his own is torn down, he\r\nbides his time and haunts the new structure built on the same spot.\r\nOr if no new house goes up, he hangs around and haunts the vacant\r\nlot, which is a more reprehensible procedure than the ordinary habits\r\nof spooks. One story concerns a house so persistently ghosted that\r\nits owner took it down section by section, trying to arrive at the\r\nlocation of the curse, but to no avail. When the whole building had\r\nbeen razed and the site plowed over, the ghost undiscouraged haunted\r\nmerrily on. Then the owner left in disgust. Algernon Blackwood is\r\nfond of situations where localities are haunted by evil spirits,[115]\r\nwhere a whole village is inhabited by the ghosts of long-dead witches,\r\nor _Secret Worship_ that relates the experience of a man who wanders\r\nwithin the limits of a place made horrible by devil-worshipers,\r\nlong-dead, but life-like, and inhabiting a house that has been torn\r\ndown years before but appears as usual, where they entrap the souls of\r\nthe living for their fiendish sacrifice. Another[116] is the record of\r\na spirit of frightful evil that haunts a house built on the spot where\r\nan older house once stood, whose diabolism lingers on to curse the\r\nliving. The spirit that haunts a locality rather than one room or house\r\nhas a more malignant power than the more restricted ghost and this adds\r\na new element of definite supernaturalism to modern fiction. But as\r\nhouses are so much less permanent now than formerly, ghosts would be at\r\na terrible disadvantage if they had to be evicted every time a building\r\nwas torn down.\r\n\r\n      [115] As in _Ancient Sorceries_.\r\n\r\n      [116] _A Psychic Invasion._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGhostly psychology is a fascinating study. The development of spectral\r\npersonality is one of the evident facts gained from a historical survey\r\nof supernatural fiction. The modern ghost has more individuality,\r\nmore distinctiveness, in the main, than his forbears. The ghosts of\r\nmedievalism, of ancient superstition, and the drama were for the most\r\npart pallid, colorless beings in character as in materialization.\r\nThe ancient ghosts were more mournful than the moderns, since the\r\nstate of the dead in early times was by no means enviable. The most\r\none could hope for then was Hades, while the spirits who hadn't been\r\nburied couldn't find entrance even there but were forced by relentless\r\nspectral police to keep forever moving. The Christian religion\r\nfurnishes a more cheerful outlook, so in later manifestations the gloom\r\nis considerably lightened. Yet even so the Gothic ghosts were morbid,\r\nlow-minded specters not much happier than the unlucky wights they felt\r\nit their business to haunt. Their woe-begone visages, their clanking\r\nchains, and other accompaniments of woe betokened anything but cheer.\r\n\r\nThere are some unhappy spirits in recent fiction, but not such a large\r\nproportion as in the past. And there is usually some basis for their\r\njoylessness; they don't have general melancholia with no grounds for\r\nit. The ghost of the dead wife in _Readjustment_[117] is miserable\r\nbecause she has never understood her husband, either in life or in\r\ndeath, and she comes back seeking an explanation. Another spectral\r\nwoman[118] is wretched because she has the double crime of murder and\r\nsuicide on her soul. Poor Marley grieves because he is doomed to see\r\nthe opportunities that life has offered him to serve others and that he\r\nhas neglected, being forced to see with the clear vision of the other\r\nworld the evil results of his own neglect, which is enough to make any\r\none wretched. A guilty conscience is like the burning heart that each\r\nspirit in the Hall of Eblis bore in his breast. In _The Roll-call of\r\nthe Reef_,[119] the troop of drowned soldiers, infantry, and horsemen,\r\ncome rising out of the surf to answer to their names. Each man is asked\r\nby name, \"How is it with you?\" and answers with the deadly sin that\r\nhas damned him. In Wilkie Collins's gruesome tale[120] there is one\r\nspirit that is unhappy because his body lies unburied, a recurrence of\r\na theme frequent in classical stories and Gothic romance, but rare in\r\nlater fiction. For the most part the later ghosts are something more\r\nthan merely unhappy spirits. They are more positive, more active, more\r\nindividualistic, too philosophical to waste time in useless grieving.\r\n\r\n      [117] By M. H. Austin.\r\n\r\n      [118] In _The Closed Cabinet_.\r\n\r\n      [119] By A. T. Quiller-Couch.\r\n\r\n      [120] _The Queen of Hearts._\r\n\r\nNor are there many simply happy spirits, perhaps because the joyous\r\nsouls are likely to seek their paradise and forget about the earth. Yet\r\nthere are instances, such as the light-hearted spirits of children in\r\nvarious stories, that with the resilience of childhood shake off gloom\r\nand are gay; Rosamond,[121] that comes back to tell her friend how\r\nhappy the other life is, the peacefully content mother,[122] and others.\r\n\r\n      [121] In _Here and There_.\r\n\r\n      [122] In _They That Mourn_.\r\n\r\nThe ghosts that are actively vicious are the most vivid and numerous\r\nin later fiction. The spirits of evil seem to have a terrible\r\ncumulative force, being far more maleficent than the earlier ones,\r\nand more powerful in carrying out their purposes. Every aspect of\r\nsupernaturalism seems to be keyed up to a higher pitch of terror. Evil\r\nseems to have a strangely greater power of immortality over that of\r\ngood, judging from the proportion employed in modern fiction. Has evil\r\nso much more strength of will, so much more permanence of power that\r\nit lives on through the years and centuries, while good deeds perish\r\nwith the body? It would appear so from fiction. The ghosts of good\r\nactions do not linger round the abode of the living to any noticeable\r\nextent, but evil deeds are deathless. We have many stories of places\r\nand persons haunted by the embodied evil of the past, but few by the\r\nembodied good. The revenge ghosts outnumber the grateful dead by\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\nModern specters have a more complex power than the old. They are more\r\nawful in their import, for they haunt not merely the body, but the\r\nsoul. The wicked spirits will to work dreadful harm to the soul as\r\nwell as the body, and drive the victim to spiritual insanity, seeking\r\nto damn him for the life everlasting, making him, not merely their\r\nvictim, but through eternity their co-worker in awful evil. The victim\r\nof the vampire, for instance, who dies as a result of the attack, has\r\nto become in his turn a loathsome vampire to prey on other souls and\r\nbodies. Blackwood's Devil-worshipers seek to kill the soul as well\r\nas the body of their victim. The deathlessness of evil is shown in\r\nLytton's[123] and in many of Blackwood's stories, as where the psychic\r\ndoctor says to a man, \"You are now in touch with certain violent\r\nemotions, passions, purposes, still active in this house, that were\r\nproduced in the past by some powerful and evil personality that lived\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n      [123] _The Haunters and the Haunted._\r\n\r\nFew writers have equaled F. Marion Crawford in the modern ghost story.\r\nHis tales have a curdling intensity, a racking horror that set them far\r\nabove the ordinary supernatural fiction. They linger in the mind long\r\nafter one has tried in vain to forget them, if indeed one ever does\r\nforget their sense of evil power. There is in each of his stories an\r\nindividual horror that marks it as distinct from its fellows, a power\r\nchiefly won by delineation of this immortality of evil, as in _The Dead\r\nSmile_, with its description of the hideous smile that pollutes the\r\nlips of the living and of the dead. \"Nurse McDonald said that when Sir\r\nHugh Ockram smiled, he saw the faces of two women in hell, two dead\r\nwomen he had betrayed.\" His vicious impulses last after death and from\r\nhis grave he reaches out to curse his own children, seeking to drive\r\nthem to awful, though unconscious sin.\r\n\r\nHenry James has drawn for us two characters of unmitigated evil in\r\nPeter Quint and Miss Jessel, who, he says, are \"hovering, prowling,\r\nblighting presences.\" They are agents on whom is laid the dire duty of\r\ncausing the air to reek with evil. He says, \"I recognize that they are\r\nnot ghosts at all, as we now know the ghost, but goblins, elves, imps,\r\ndemons. The essence of the matter was the villainy of the motive in the\r\nevoked predatory creature.\" What he wishes to do in this story is to\r\nexpress a general sense of spiritual infamy, not specialized, as the\r\nhot breath of the Pit usually confines itself to some one particular\r\npsychical brutality, but as capable of everything, the worst that can\r\nbe conceived. How well he has succeeded in his effort, those who know\r\nthe story can testify.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Bierce's stories are in many instances remarkable examples\r\nof this psychic horror. _The Death of Halpin Frazer_ has a touch of\r\nalmost unbearable dreadfulness. Frazer is assaulted by an evil spirit\r\nin a wood at night and choked to death, the spirit inhabiting the dead\r\nbody of the man's own mother who has idolized him. His dead mother's\r\nface, transfixed with diabolical hate, is thrust upon him, and the\r\nloved hands that have caressed him strangle him. This is similar to\r\nthe situation of an evil spirit occupying the body of a loved dead\r\nmother in _The Mummy's Tale_, by Elliot O'Donnell. Bierce's stories\r\nbeat upon the mind like bludgeons and his morbid plots are among the\r\nmost dreadful in our literature. One wonders what abnormality of\r\nmind conceives such themes, evolves such situations. If it be true,\r\nas Macaulay suggests, that not only every poet but every person who\r\nappreciates poetry is slightly unbalanced mentally, surely every writer\r\nof such extreme and horrific stories must be abnormal. There is more\r\nthan one writer of modern ghostly fiction of whom it might be said that\r\n\"his soul is open on the Hell side.\"\r\n\r\nAnother temperament found distinctively in the later fiction is the\r\nhumorous ghost. He is a recent development, and as might be supposed,\r\nis characteristically American. There were a few burlesque ghosts\r\nin Elizabethan drama, the Ghost of Jack,[124] for instance, and\r\none colored ghost that would seem to connote mirth, but the really\r\nhumorous specter did not come till later. It remained for the Yankee\r\nto evoke the spook with a sense of humor. Ghosts are not essentially\r\nlaughable, and to make them comic without coarseness or irreverence\r\nis an achievement. Numerous writers have busied their pens with the\r\nfunny spook and now we have ghostly laughter that is mirthful and not\r\nhorrisonous as in other types. Specters now laugh with us instead of at\r\nus, and instead of the mocking laughter heard in lonely places we have\r\n\"heart-easing mirth.\" Washington Irving evokes several humorous hoax\r\nghosts, such as the headless horseman that created excitement in Sleepy\r\nHollow and the serenading phantom in _The Specter Bridegroom_.\r\n\r\n      [124] In Peele's _Old Wives Tales_.\r\n\r\nRichard Middleton in his _Ghost Ship_ shows some very informal humorous\r\nghosts. The girls and boys rise from their graves to flirt over their\r\ntombstones on moonlight nights, and the children play with the village\r\nspecters as companions, their favorite being the man that sits on the\r\nwellcurbing with his severed head held in his hands. The cottagers\r\nrebuke the spooks overhead when they grow too noisy, and a general\r\ngood-fellowship prevails. Into this setting the ghost ship sails one\r\nnight, anchoring itself in the middle of a turnip patch, and the\r\nriotous captain demoralizes the men of the village, ghosts and all,\r\nwith his rum and his jokes. After a stay of some time, one night in a\r\nstorm the villagers look out.\r\n\r\n  Over our heads, sailing very comfortably through the windy stars,\r\n  was the ship that had passed the summer in landlord's field. Her\r\n  portholes and her windows were ablaze with lights and there was a\r\n  noise of singing and fiddling on her decks.... They do say that\r\n  since then the turnips on landlord's field have tasted of rum.\r\n\r\nOlive Harper tells[125] of a reporter who is invited by a cordial\r\nspook--who has been a New York social leader--to a spectral banquet\r\nand ball underneath Old Trinity. She satirizes human foibles and\r\nweaknesses, showing ghosts that gossip and gormandize, simper and\r\nswear as they did in life. They learn to play poker, dance, and\r\nkill time as they used to do. Frank R. Stockton has written several\r\ndelicious drolleries of supernaturalism, as _The Transferred Ghost_,\r\nwhere the spook of a living man, the irascible uncle of the charming\r\nMadeline, terrifies the young suitor who lacks courage to propose.\r\nThe audacious and ever-present ghost swings his feet from the porch\r\nrailing, invisible to the girl as inaudible by her, and breaks in on\r\nthe conversation in a most disconcerting way. The young man at last\r\ncries out in desperation, \"What are you waiting for? I have nothing\r\nto say to you?\" whereat the girl, who has been undoubtedly waiting to\r\nhear the proposal the embarrassed youth was trying to make, thinks he\r\nis speaking to her and departs in high dudgeon. On a later occasion the\r\nspecter comes to announce to him that he has got his transfer and may\r\nbe somebody else's ghost instead of that of the man who was expected to\r\ndie and didn't, when the lover cries out, \"I wish to Heaven you were\r\nmine!\" And Madeline, melting in a sigh, whispers, \"I am yours!\" The\r\nsequel to this is also comic.[126]\r\n\r\n      [125] In _The Sociable Ghost_.\r\n\r\n      [126] _The Spectral Mortgage._\r\n\r\nBrander Matthews has several stories of humorous supernaturalism,\r\n_Rival Ghosts_ being the account of ancestral spooks belonging to\r\na young bridegroom, and who resent being brought into enforced\r\ncompanionship by his sudden elevation to a title, since one ghost\r\nmust haunt the house and one the heir. The ingenious groom, at last\r\nharassed to invention by the continual squabbling of the ghosts, brings\r\nabout a wedding between them. This is the only instance I have found\r\nof a wedding between two specters, though there are various cases on\r\nrecord of marriage between one living and one spectral personage.\r\nJohn Kendrick Bangs devotes several volumes to the doings and sayings\r\nof spooks, describing parties in a house-boat on the Styx, where the\r\nshades of the departed great gather together and engage in festivities\r\nand discussions, and showing types of water-ghosts and various kinds\r\nof spooks. The humorous ghost is a more frequent person than one would\r\nsuppose without giving some thought to the subject, for many writers\r\nhave sharpened their wits on the comic haunt.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen from the examples mentioned, the ghost has made\r\nperceptible progress in psychology. The modern apparition is much more\r\ncomplex in personality than the crude early type, and shows much more\r\nvariety. The up-to-date spook who has a chance to talk things over\r\nwith William James, and knows the labyrinths of the human mind is much\r\nbetter adapted to inflict psychal terrors than the illiterate specter\r\nof the past. He can evolve mental tortures more subtle and varied than\r\never, or he can amuse a downcast mortal by his gambols.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStories of to-day show a decided advance over the Gothic in the matter\r\nof motives for spectral appearance. There are, it is true, certain\r\nmotives in common between them, but the present-day spirit is less\r\nlimited, for he has gained the new without loss of the old, if he\r\nwishes to keep the old. The principal impulse that impelled classical\r\nshades to walk the earth was to request burial, since lacking that he\r\ncould not enter into the abode of the dead. This appears frequently\r\nalso in Gothic romance. It is shown but little in recent fiction,\r\nperhaps because the modern ghost is reconciled to cremation or is\r\nblithely indifferent to what becomes of his body since it no longer\r\nrules him. _The Queen of Hearts_ is one of the few instances of its\r\nuse in modern fiction, for it is a vanishing motive for the most part.\r\nGothic ghosts were also wont to return to show the hiding-place of\r\ntreasure, but that, too, is dying out as an incentive to haunting. The\r\nprosaic explanation here may be that now persons put their treasure in\r\nsafety deposits, hence there is scant occasion for mystery concerning\r\nits location after death. Gothic spooks came back on occasion to reveal\r\nparentage, for parents, like valuables, were frequently mislaid in\r\nterror romance. This is not so important now, since vital statistics\r\nusually keep such matters duly recorded, yet instances do sometimes\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nGhosts in the terror romance came to make requests, apart from the\r\npetition for burial, which tendency is still observed on the part of\r\nlater spooks, though not to the same extent as formerly. The requests\r\nare psychologically interesting, as they usually relate to simple\r\nties of affection, illustrated by the mother-spirit[127] who asks her\r\nfriend to take her children. Gothic spirits came back often to make\r\nrevelations concerning the manner of their death, which is not often\r\nthe case now, though it does sometimes happen. And Dickens shows us one\r\nghost returning to influence the jury that is trying a man for murder.\r\nSpecters used to appear to forewarn the living against impending\r\ndanger, which impulse is rather lacking in later fiction though it\r\nstill occurs. The curious element of futurity enters into several\r\nof these ghostly warnings, as in Dickens's _The Signal Man_ where\r\nthe apparition presages the man's death, as in Algernon Blackwood's\r\nstory[128] is related the incident of a man who saw the two Indians\r\nscalp a white man and drag his body away, at last crying out, \"I saw\r\nthe body, and _the face was my own_.\" Warning spirits of futurity are\r\nseen in _On the Stairs_, where each man beholds his own destiny,--one\r\nseeing the spectral snake that afterwards kills him in a hunting\r\nexpedition, one the ghost of a Zulu, the savage that almost destroys\r\nhim some time afterwards, and the last the ghost of a young woman in a\r\nblue dress, the woman whom he marries and who hounds him to his death.\r\nShe presently sees her own fate, too, but what it is the author does\r\nnot tell us. One curious incident in the story is the instantaneous\r\nappearance on the stairs of the woman herself and her ghostly double,\r\none in a white dress, one in the fatal blue. This sort of spectral\r\nwarning, this wireless service for the conveyance of bad news and hint\r\nof threatening danger, serves to link the ghost story of the present\r\nwith those of the past. The records of the Psychical Society show\r\nhundreds of such instances, and much use is made in fiction of plots\r\nhinging on such motif. Scott's White Lady of Avenel appears as a death\r\nportent, as also the \"Bahr-geist\" in another novel.\r\n\r\n      [127] In _The Substitute_.\r\n\r\n      [128] In _A Haunted Island_.\r\n\r\nThe revenge ghost looms large in fiction as in the drama. He was\r\nthe most important figure in Elizabethan as in classical drama, and\r\nShakespeare's ghosts are principally of that class. A terrible example\r\nof the type is in Robert Lovell Beddoes' _Death's Jest-Book_, that\r\nextraordinary example of dramatic supernaturalism, where the ghost of\r\nthe murdered man comes back embodied from the grave and is an active\r\ncharacter to the end of the play. He is summoned to life through a\r\nhideous mistake, the murderer having asked the magician to call up\r\nthe spirit of his dead wife, but the body of his victim having been\r\nsecretly buried beside her so that the murderer may have no rest\r\neven in the grave, the awful accusing spirit rises to confront him,\r\ninstead of his wife's phantom. The revenge ghost is both objective\r\nand subjective in his manifestation and his impelling motive adds a\r\ntouch of frozen horror to his appearance. He appears in various forms,\r\nas dismembered parts of the body--illustrated in the stories above\r\nreferred to,--in a horrific invisibility, in a shape of fear visible\r\nonly to the guilty, or in a body so objectified as to seem absolutely\r\nreal and living to others beside the one haunted. The apparently\r\ncasual, idle figure that strolls about the docks and streets in _The\r\nDetective_, seen by different persons and taken for a man interested\r\nonly in his own pursuits, is a revenge ghost so relentless that he\r\nhounds his victim from country to country, at last killing him by sheer\r\nforce of terror as he sits on his bed at night, leaving the imprint\r\nof his body on the mattress beside the dead man whose face is rigid\r\nwith mad horror. He has come back in physical embodiment to avenge\r\nthe betrayal of his daughter. Ambrose Bierce shows us many spirits\r\nanimated by cold and awful revenge, sometimes visible and sometimes\r\nunseen, as where a soldier killed for striking an officer answers,\r\n\"Here!\" to the roll-call, just at which moment a mysterious bullet from\r\nnowhere strikes the officer through the heart.[129] Crawford sends\r\na drowned sailor back in wet oil-skins to slay his twin brother who\r\nhas impersonated him to win the girl they both loved. When the two\r\nbodies wash ashore one is a newly dead corpse, the other a skeleton\r\nin oil skins; while the dreadful rattle of the accusing lump of lead\r\nin the wife's skull in another story is a turn of the screw of her\r\nhorrid revenge. The revenge ghost in modern fiction is more varied in\r\nforms of manifestation, at times more subtle in suggestion and ghostly\r\npsychology, than the conventionalized type of the drama and remains one\r\nof the most dreadful of the forms of fear.\r\n\r\n      [129] In _His Two Military Executions_.\r\n\r\nIn general, the modern stories show a greater intensity of power in\r\nemploying the motives that earlier forms had used as well as far\r\ngreater range of motivation. The earlier ghosts were limited in their\r\nimpulses, and their psychology was comparatively simple. Not so with\r\nthe apparitions of to-day. They have a far wider range of motives,\r\nare moved by more complex impulses and mixed motivation in many cases\r\ndifficult to analyze.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic ghost had some conscience about whom he haunted. He had\r\ntoo much reserve to force himself needlessly upon those that had no\r\nconnection with his past. If he knew someone that deserved punishment\r\nfor wrong done him or his, he tried to haunt him and let others alone.\r\nThe modern ghost is not so considerate. He is actuated in many cases\r\nby sheer evil that wreaks itself upon anyone in range. Death gives\r\na terrible immortality and access of power to those whose lives have\r\nbeen particularly evil, and the results are dangerous to society.\r\nDark discarnate hate manifests itself to those within reach. Algernon\r\nBlackwood would have us believe that all around us are reservoirs of\r\nunspeakable horror and that any moment of weakness on our part may\r\nbring down the hosts of damnation upon us. This is illustrated in\r\nsuch stories as _With Intent to Steal_, where the spirit of a man who\r\nhas hanged himself comes back with hypnotic power forcing others to\r\ntake their lives in the same way, or in another,[130] showing power\r\nexerted viciously against human beings in a certain building, or still\r\nanother[131] where the witchcraft holds the village in thrall, and\r\nelsewhere. Ambrose Bierce, Bram Stoker, F. Marion Crawford, and Arthur\r\nMachen have written a number of stories bringing out this side of\r\nghostly psychology, showing the bands of outlawed spirits that prey on\r\nsociety. There are spectral bandits and bravos that answer the call of\r\nany force hostile to man, or act of their own accord from an impulse of\r\nmalicious mischief.\r\n\r\n      [130] _The Empty House._\r\n\r\n      [131] _Secret Worship._\r\n\r\nThe jealous ghost is somewhat common of late, showing that human\r\nemotions are carried over into the life beyond. In various stories we\r\nfind the dead wife interfering to prevent a second marriage, or to\r\nmake life wretched for the interloper even after the ceremony. But the\r\nmost extreme case of jealousy--even exceeding the instance of the man\r\nwhose wife and physician conspired to give him an overdose to put him\r\nout of the way and who is frantic to prevent their marriage--is found\r\nin Arnold Bennett's novel, _The Ghost_. Here the spirit of a man who\r\nhas madly loved an opera-singer haunts every suitor of hers and either\r\ndrives him to abandon his courtship or kills him, till finally the\r\nsinger begs the ghost to spare the man she loves, which he sadly does,\r\nand departs. This is reminiscent of one of Marie de France's _lais_.\r\n\r\nThe varying motives for appearance may be illustrated by reference to\r\na few ghosts in modern fiction, such as the woman[132] who comes to\r\ndrive away a writer's sense of humor,--than which there could be no\r\ngreater spiritual brutality,--and set him to writing vile, debased\r\ntragedies. Perhaps she has transferred her attentions to other authors\r\nthan the one in the story! Other instances are the little Gray Ghost\r\nin Cornelia A. P. Comer's story by that name, who impels a stranger to\r\ntake her child from an orphan asylum and adopt it, much against his\r\nwill; the immortal lovers that haunt a woman who has made a marriage\r\nof convenience--which has turned out to be a marriage of inconvenience\r\nfor her husband[133]; the talkative spook in Andrew Lang's _In Castle\r\nPerilous_, that discourses learnedly on its own materialization,\r\nspeaking in technical terms, pokes fun at Shakespeare for the glow-worm\r\non a winter night, and the cockcrow in his _Hamlet_, and--but these are\r\nperhaps enough. If one may judge from ghostly fiction, death subtracts\r\nnothing from human emotion but rather adds to it, so that the spectral\r\nimpulses are more poignant and intense. The darker passions are\r\nretained with cumulative power, and there is a terrible immortality of\r\nhate, of jealousy and revenge.\r\n\r\n      [132] In _A Psychic Invasion_.\r\n\r\n      [133] In _The Long Chamber_.\r\n\r\nThere is no more impressive revenant than one Coleridge gives in his\r\n_Wanderings of Cain_, the mournful phantom of Abel appearing to Cain\r\nand his little son, Enos. The child says to his father, \"I saw a man in\r\nunclean garments and he uttered a sweet voice, full of lamentations.\"\r\nCain asks the unhappy spirit, \"But didst thou not find favor in the\r\nsight of the Lord thy God?\" to which the shape answers, \"The Lord is\r\nGod of the living only. The dead have another God!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Cain ran after the shape and the shape fled shrieking over the\r\n  sands, and the sands rose like white mists behind the steps of Cain\r\n  but the feet of him that was like Abel disturbed not the sands.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting phases of comparative ghost-lore is the\r\nstudy of the intricate personality of specters. With respect to dual\r\npersonality the late supernatural stories are curiously reminiscent of\r\nthe animistic belief that a ghost is a double of the mortal, a vapory\r\nprojection of his actual body, to be detached at will during life\r\nand permanently at death. I do not know of any instances of doubles\r\nin classical literature, nor is the idea used in Gothic romance.\r\nLikewise Shakespeare's ghosts are all spirits of persons safely dead.\r\nIt remained for the modern writer with his expertness in psychology\r\nand psychiatry to evoke the ghosts of the living persons, the strange\r\ncases of dual personality and of separate personalities supernaturally\r\nmerged into one, and those inexplicable ghosts of subliminal memories.\r\nAll these forms appear in elusive analysis, in complex suggestiveness,\r\nin modern uncanny stories, and constitute one of the distinct marks of\r\nadvance over the earlier types.\r\n\r\nThe double, a frequent figure in English fiction, bears a resemblance\r\nto the Doppelgänger of German folk-tales. Numerous examples of dual\r\npersonality, of one being appearing in two forms, are seen, with\r\ndifferent twists to the idea, yet much alike. It has been suggested\r\nthat these stories have their germinal origin in Calderon's play,[134]\r\nwhere a man is haunted by himself. Poe's _William Wilson_ is a tense\r\nand tragic story of a man pursued by his double, till in desperation\r\nhe kills him, only to realize that he has slain his better self, his\r\nconscience. His duplicate cries out, \"Henceforward thou art also dead,\r\ndead to the world, to Heaven and to hope! In me thou didst exist and\r\nin my death, see by this thine image, which is thine own, how utterly\r\nthou hast murdered thyself!\" Stevenson's _Markheim_ shows in the person\r\nof the stranger the incarnate conscience, an embodiment of a man's\r\nnobler self that leads him through the labyrinth of self-examination\r\nto the knowledge of the soul's truth. The stranger tests the murderer\r\nby offering him a way of escape, by suggesting further crime to him,\r\nby showing him relentlessly what the consequence of each act will be,\r\ntill in despair Markheim, realizing that his life is hopelessly weak\r\nand involved, decides to surrender it rather than to sin further.\r\nStep by step the nameless visitor leads him, Markheim shuddering\r\nback from the evil that is suggested, thinking the stranger is a\r\ndemonic tempter, till at last the transfigured face shows him to\r\nbe the nobler angel. Stevenson's _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ is, of\r\ncourse, the best-known instance of this sort of dual personality, this\r\nwalking forth in physical form of the evil in one's own nature, with\r\na separate existence of its own. No writer could hope to express this\r\nidea more powerfully than has been done in this chemical allegory,\r\nthis biological dissection of the soul. The thrill of suspense, the\r\nseemingly inexplicable mystery, the dramatic tenseness of the closing\r\nscenes make this sermon in story form unforgettable. Kipling has given\r\na striking story of a man haunted by his own phantom body, in _At the\r\nEnd of the Passage_. His own figure slipped silently before him as he\r\nwent through his lonely house. \"When he came in to dinner he found\r\nhimself seated at the table. The vision rose and walked out hastily.\r\nExcept that it cast no shadow it was in all respects real.\" The horror\r\nof this haunting specter of himself, this double of his own body and\r\nsoul, drives the man to suicide, after which a peculiar twist of\r\nhorror is given by the detail at the close, of the discovery by his\r\ncomrade, of the man's own photograph imprinted on the dead retina and\r\nreproduced by the camera hours after his death. In Julian Hawthorne's\r\nallegory,[135] the dead man's spirit meets the devil, who is his own\r\nevil self incarnate.\r\n\r\n      [134] _El Embozado._\r\n\r\n      [135] _Lovers in Heaven._\r\n\r\nEdith Wharton's _Triumph of Night_ reveals a ghost of a living man\r\nstanding behind his double's chair, visible to the person opposite\r\nand showing on the ghostly face the evil impulses that the living\r\ncountenance cleverly masks. John Kendrick Bangs has his hero say,[136]\r\n\"I came face to face with myself, with that other self in which I\r\nrecognized, developed to the fullest extent, every bit of my capacity\r\nfor an evil life,\" and Blackwood[137] relates the meeting of a\r\nmusician and his ghostly double in an opera hall. Mr. Titbottom,[138]\r\nthrough the power of his magic spectacles reflecting his image in a\r\nmirror, sees himself as he really is, as he looks to God, and flees\r\nhorror-stricken from the sight. This symbolic representation is akin to\r\nthe _Prophetic Pictures_ of Hawthorne, where a woman's griefs and marks\r\nof age are shown in her pictured face before they are revealed in her\r\nactual experience, a pictured futurity. The most impressive instance\r\nof this relation between a human being and his portrait is in Oscar\r\nWilde's _Picture of Dorian Gray_, that strange study of a man's real\r\nnature expressing itself on his painted likeness, while the living face\r\nbears no mark of sin or shame or age, until the tragic revelation at\r\nthe end. Edith Wharton[139] also represents a supernatural dualism, the\r\nwoman's statue showing on its marble face the changing horror of her\r\nown stricken countenance. _The White Sleep of Auber Hurn_ is a curious\r\nstory of a spiritual double, a psychological study of a man who was in\r\ntwo places at once, seen by various persons who knew him in each case,\r\nbeing killed in a train wreck many miles away from his room where he\r\nwas lying asleep in his bed,--a sleep that knows no waking.[140]\r\n\r\n      [136] In _Thurlow's Christmas Story_.\r\n\r\n      [137] In _The Man from the Gods_.\r\n\r\n      [138] In George William Curtis's _Prue and I_.\r\n\r\n      [139] In her _Duchess at Prayer_.\r\n\r\n      [140] Other stories of double personality are _The Ivory Gate_,\r\n      by Walter Besant; _The Man with a Shadow_, by George M. Fenn;\r\n      _The Jolly Corner_, by Henry James; _The Transferred Ghost_,\r\n      by Frank R. Stockton; _On the Stairs_, by Katherine Fullerton\r\n      Gerould; _Elixiere des Teufels_, by E. T. A. Hoffmann; _Howe's\r\n      Masquerade_, by Hawthorne; _The Recent Carnival of Crime in\r\n      Connecticut_, by Mark Twain; _The Queen of Sheba_, by Thomas\r\n      Bailey Aldrich; _The Doppelgänger_, by Elizabeth Bisland\r\n      Wetmore.\r\n\r\n      Georg Brandes, in his article, \"Romantic Reduplication\r\n      and Psychology,\" in _Main Currents of Nineteenth Century\r\n      Literature_, points out the prevalence of this motif in German\r\n      fiction. He says: \"It finds its first expression in Jean\r\n      Paul's _Leibgeber Schappe_, and is to be found in almost all\r\n      of Hoffmann's tales, reaching its climax in _Die Elixiere des\r\n      Teufels_. It crops up in the writings of all the Romanticists,\r\n      in Kleist's _Amphitryon_, in Achim von Arnim's _Die Beiden\r\n      Waldemar_, in Chamisso's _Erscheinung_. Brentano treats it\r\n      comically in _Die Mehreren Wehmüller_.\"\r\n\r\nDistinct from the expression of one personality in two bodies, the\r\nsupernatural merging of two separate personalities into one appears\r\nin recent ghostly fiction. It forms a subtle psychologic study and is\r\nuncannily effective. H. G. Wells's _Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham_\r\nis a peculiar narrative of a transfer of personality as the result of\r\na mysterious drink, by which an old man takes possession of a young\r\nman's body, leaving the youth to inhabit the worn-out shell of the\r\ndotard. Algernon Blackwood in _The Terror of the Twins_ describes a\r\nsupernatural merging of two natures into one by the power of a dead\r\nfather's insane curse. The younger son loses his vitality, his mind,\r\nhis personality, all of which is supermortally given to his older\r\nbrother, while the deprived son dies a drivelling idiot of sheer\r\ninertia and utter absence of vital power. Mary Heaton Vorse[141]\r\ndescribes a neurotic woman who comes back from the grave to obsess and\r\npossess the interloper in her home, through the immortal force of her\r\njealousy, making the living woman actually become the reincarnation\r\nof the dead wife. This story naturally suggests Poe's _Ligeia_ which\r\nis the climax of ghostly horror of this motif, with its thesis that\r\n\"man doth not yield himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save\r\nthrough the weakness of his own feeble will\" expressed in a terrible\r\ncrescendo of ghastly horror. Poe's _Morella_ is a similar study of the\r\nsupernatural merging of an exterior personality into a living body,\r\nwhere the dead mother and her child are literally one flesh and one\r\nspirit. Blackwood's _The Return_ is an example of the compact-ghost,\r\nthat comes back at the hour of death to reveal himself to his friend\r\nas he long ago promised he would. The dead artist manifests himself\r\nthrough a sudden and wonderful realization of the beauty of the world\r\nto which the materialistic friend has heretofore been blinded and\r\nindifferent. Feeling this sudden rapturous sweep of beauty through his\r\nsoul, the living man knows that his artist friend is dead and that\r\nhis spirit has become a part of his own being. In the same manner the\r\nlittle lonely soul in Granville Barker's wonderful piece of symbolism,\r\n_Souls on Fifth_, enters into the being of the man who has the\r\nunderstanding heart and continues her existence as a part of him.\r\n\r\n      [141] In _The Second Wife_.\r\n\r\nAn essentially modern type of ghost story is that which has its\r\nexplanation on the basis of subliminal memories. It seems that all\r\naround us are reservoirs of ancestral memories, records of the vital\r\nthoughts and actions of the long dead, psychical incarnations of\r\ntheir supreme moments, their striking hours, into which the living\r\nat times stumble and are submerged. Some slight spiritual accident\r\nmay bring down upon mortals the poignant suffering and bliss of the\r\ndead in whose personality they are curiously duplicated. These ghosts\r\nof dead selves from the past are different from the doubles that are\r\nprojections of the living, or prophetic specters of the future, and\r\nare clearly distinguished. _The Borderland_, by Francis Parsons,\r\ntells of a young army officer who is obsessed by subliminal self,\r\nthe ghost of his grandfather. He feels that he _is_ his grandfather,\r\nliving another existence, yet he lacks the pluck, the manhood, that\r\nthe old pioneer possessed. At a crisis in his military affairs, the\r\nold frontiersman comes visibly forward to give him the courage that is\r\nneeded, after which he manifests himself no more. The scene of this\r\nsubliminal haunting is a Texas prairie, during a border fight, rather\r\nan unghostly setting yet one which makes the supernatural seem more\r\nactual. Arthur Johnson[142] presents the case of a man who sees the\r\nghosts of ancestral memory in a vivid form. He sees and hears his own\r\ndouble wildly accuse his wife--who is the double of his own--betrothed,\r\nafter having killed her lover. His hand is wounded and the fingers\r\nleave bloodstains as they snatch at the gray chiffon round his wife's\r\nthroat. After a fit of unconsciousness into which he falls is over, the\r\nmodern man awakes to find his hand strangely wounded, and on the floor\r\nof the upper room he picks up a scrap of bloodstained gray chiffon!\r\nBlackwood's _Old Clothes_ shows a little girl obsessed by subliminal\r\nmemories. She is haunted by terrible experiences in which she says that\r\nshe and some of those around her have been concerned. She goes into\r\nconvulsions if anything is fastened around her waist, and she cries\r\nout that some cruel man has shut her up in the wall to die and has cut\r\noff Philip's hands so that he cannot save her. Investigations bring\r\nto light the facts that a long-dead ancestress, living in the same\r\nhouse, had been walled up alive by her husband after he had cut off her\r\nlover's hands before her face. The skeleton is found chained by the\r\nwaist inside the ancient wall. Blackwood's _Ancient Sorceries_ depicts\r\nthe ghosts of buried life, of a whole village enchanted by the past\r\nand living over again the witchcraft of the long ago. As John Silence,\r\nthe psychic doctor, tells of the Englishman who drops casually into the\r\nvillage and is drawn into the magic:\r\n\r\n  Vesin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out of the\r\n  intense activities of a past life and lived over again a scene in\r\n  which he had often played a part centuries ago. For strong actions\r\n  set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves that they\r\n  may be said in a sense never to die. In this case they were not\r\n  complete enough to render the illusion perfect, so the little man\r\n  was confused between the present and the past.\r\n\r\n      [142] In _Mr. Eberdeen's House_.\r\n\r\nThat story of unusual psychical experience, _An Adventure_, by two\r\nOxford women, can be explained on no other basis than some such theory\r\nas this. The book claims to be a truthful account of a happening\r\nat Versailles, where two English women, teachers and daughters of\r\nclergymen, saw in broad daylight the ghosts of the past, the figures of\r\nMarie Antoinette and her court. The writers offer the explanation that\r\nthey stumbled into a sort of pocket of the unhappy queen's memories\r\nand saw the past relived before their eyes because she had felt it so\r\nkeenly and vividly long ago. Other instances might be given, but these\r\nare sufficient to illustrate the type. Such stories have a curious\r\nhaunting power and are among the most effective narratives. The idea is\r\nmodern and illustrates the complexity of later thought as compared with\r\nthe simplicity of earlier times.\r\n\r\nA comparative study of ghost stories leads one to the conclusion\r\nthat the ghost is the most modern of ancients and the most ancient\r\nof moderns. In some respects the present specter is like and in some\r\nunlike the previous forms. Ghosts, whether regarded as conjective or\r\npurely subjective, are closely related to the percipients' thoughts.\r\nPrimitive times produced a primitive supernaturalism and the gradual\r\nadvance in intellectual development has brought about a heightening and\r\ncomplexity of the weird story. 'Tis in ourselves that ghosts are thus\r\nand so!\r\n\r\nThe spook of to-day is of a higher nervous organization than his\r\nforbears. In many instances the latter-day ghost is so distracted by\r\ncircumstances that he hardly knows where he's at, as for instance,\r\nthe ghost in such case as _The Tryst_, by Alice Brown, where a\r\nman is thought to be drowned and his ghost comes out to comfort\r\nhis sweetheart, only to have the drowned man brought back to life\r\npresently; and in _The Woman from Yonder_, by Stephen French Whitman,\r\nwhere a scientist with impertinent zeal brings life back to the body\r\nof a woman who had bled to death while Hannibal was crossing the Alps\r\nand been buried in a glacier till the glacier spat her out. Now,\r\nwhat was the status of those ghosts? Was there a ghost if the person\r\nwasn't really dead? But if a woman isn't dead after she has been in an\r\nice-pack for two thousand years or thereabouts what surety is there for\r\nthe standing of any ghost?\r\n\r\nThe apparitions of to-day have more lines of interest than the ancient\r\nghosts. The Gothic specter was a one-idea creature, with a single-track\r\nbrain. He was not a ghost-of-all-work as are some of the later spooks.\r\nHe was a simple-souled being who felt a call to haunt somebody for some\r\npurpose or other, so he just went and did it. The specters of to-day\r\nare more versatile,--they can turn their hand to any kind of haunting\r\nthat is desired and show an admirable power of adaptability, though\r\nthere are highly developed specialists as well. The psychology of the\r\nprimitive ghost and of the Gothic specter was simple. They knew only\r\nthe elemental passions of love and hate. Gothic spooks haunted the\r\nvillain or villainess to foil them in their wicked designs or punish\r\nthem for past misdeeds, or hovered over the hero or heroine to advise,\r\ncomfort, and chaperon them. But the modern ghosts are not satisfied\r\nwith such sit-by-the-fire jobs as these. They like to keep in the\r\nvan of activity and do what mortals do. They run the whole scale of\r\nhuman motions and emotions and one needs as much handy psychology to\r\ninterpret their hauntings as to read George Meredith. They are actuated\r\nby subtle motivations of jealousy, ardent love, tempered friendship,\r\ncuriosity, mischief, vindictiveness, revenge, hate, gratitude, and all\r\nother conceivable impulses. The Billy Sunday sort of ghost who wants to\r\nconvert the world, the philanthropic spirit who wants to help humanity,\r\nthe socialist specter that reads the magazine, the friendly visitor\r\nthat sends its hands back to wash the dishes, the little shepherd lad\r\nthat returns to tend the sheep, are among the new concepts in fiction\r\nof the supernatural. The ghost of awful malice, to be explained only on\r\nthe basis of compound interest of evil stored up for many years, is a\r\nnew force.\r\n\r\nThough the ghostly narrative has shifted its center of gravity from\r\nthe novel to the short story since Gothic times, and many more of the\r\nmodern instances are in that form, the supernatural novel has recently\r\ntaken on a new lease of life. Honors are almost even between the\r\nEnglish and the American ghost story, as most of the representative\r\nwriters on each side turn their pen at some time to write terror\r\ntales. The ghost has never lost his power over the human mind. Judging\r\nfrom the past, one may say that the popularity of the ghost story\r\nwill continue undiminished and will perhaps increase. Certainly there\r\nhas been a new influx of stories within later times. What mines of\r\nhorror yet remain untouched for writers of the future, it would be\r\nhard to say, yet we do not fear for the exhaustion of the type. On the\r\ncontrary, ghosts in fiction are becoming so numerous that one wonders\r\nif the Malthusian theory will not in time affect them. We are too fond\r\nof being fooled by phantoms to surrender them, for \"the slow touch of a\r\nfrozen finger tracing out the spine\" is an awesome joy. For ourselves,\r\nwe are content for the present to function on one plane, but we love to\r\nadventure on another plane through spectral substitutes. We may give up\r\nthe mortal but we'll not willingly give up the ghost. We love him. We\r\nbelieve in him. Our attitude towards specters is much like that of the\r\nlittle black boy that Ellis Parker Butler tells about in _Dey Ain't No\r\nGhosts_, who sees a terrifying array of \"all de sperits in de world,\r\nan' all de ha'nt in de world, an' all de hobgoblins in de world, an'\r\nall spicters in de world, an' all de ghostes in de world,\" come out to\r\nbring a fearsome message to a frightened pickaninny.\r\n\r\n  De king ob de ghostes, whut name old Skull-an'-Bones, he place he\r\n  hand on de head ob li'l black Mose, an' de hand feel like a wet\r\n  rag, an' he say:\r\n\r\n  \"Dey ain'no ghosts!\"\r\n\r\n  An' one ob de hairs on de head ob li'l black Mose turn' white.\r\n\r\n  An' de monstrous big ha'nt what he name Bloody Bones he lay he hand\r\n  on de head ob li'l black Mose, an' he hand feel like a toad-stool\r\n  in de cool ob de day, an' he say:\r\n\r\n  \"Dey ain' no ghosts!\"\r\n\r\n  An' anudder one ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l black Mose\r\n  turn' white.\r\n\r\n  An' a heejus sperit whut he name Moldy Pa'm place he hand on de\r\n  head ob li'l black Mose, an' he hand feel like de yunner side ob a\r\n  lizard, an' he say:\r\n\r\n  \"Dey ain' no ghosts!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on through the assembly. Small wonder that the terrified\r\nyoungster is loath to go up to the loft to bed alone that night and\r\ndemurs to the demand.\r\n\r\n  So he ma she say, \"Git erlong wid you! Whut you skeered ob when dey\r\n  ain' no ghosts?\"\r\n\r\n  An' li'l black Mose he scrooge an' he twist an' he pucker up he\r\n  mouf an' he rub he eyes an' prisintly he say right low:\r\n\r\n  \"I ain' skeered ob de ghosts whut am, ca'se dey ain' no ghosts.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Den whut _am_ you skeered ob?\" ask he ma.\r\n\r\n  \"Nuffin,\" say de li'l black boy whut he name am Mose, \"but I jes'\r\n  feel kinder oneasy 'bout de ghosts whut ain't!\"\r\n\r\n  Jes' lack white folks. Jes' lack white folks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Devil and His Allies\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ghosts are few but devils are plenty,\" said Cotton Mather, but his\r\nsaying would need to be inverted to fit present-day English fiction.\r\nNow we have ghosts in abundance but devils are scarce. In fact, they\r\nbid fair to become extinct in our romances, at least in the form that\r\nis easily recognizable. Satan will probably soon be in solution,\r\nidentified merely as a state of mind. He has been so Burbanked of\r\nlate, with his dæmonic characteristics removed and humanities added\r\nthat, save for sporadic reversion to type, the old familiar demon is\r\nalmost a vanished form. The modern mind seems to cling with a new\r\nfondness to the ghost but has turned the cold shoulder to the devil,\r\nperhaps because many modernists believe more in the human and less\r\nin the supernatural--and after all, ghosts are human and devils are\r\nnot. The demon has disported himself in various forms in literature,\r\nfrom the scarlet fiend of monkish legend, the nimble imp and titanic\r\nnature-devil of folk-lore to Milton's epic, majestic Satan, and\r\nGoethe's mocking Mephistopheles, passing into allegoric, symbolic, and\r\nsatiric figures in later fiction. He has been an impressive character\r\nin the drama, the epic, the novel, in poetry, and the short story. We\r\nhave seen him as a loathly, brutish demon in Dante, as a superman,\r\nas an intellectual satirist, and as a human being appealing to our\r\nsympathy. He has gradually lost his epic qualities and become human.\r\nHe is not present in literature now to the extent to which he was known\r\nin the past, is not so impressive a figure as heretofore, and at times\r\nwhen he does appear his personality is so ambiguously set forth that it\r\nrequires close literary analysis to prove his presence.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the devil will be discussed with reference to his\r\nappearances on earth, while in a later division he will be seen in\r\nhis own home. It would be hard to say with certainty when and where\r\nthe devil originated, yet he undoubtedly belongs to one of our first\r\nfamilies and is said to have been born theologically in Persia about\r\nthe year 900 B.C. He has appeared under various aliases, as Ahriman of\r\nthe Zoroastrian system, Pluto in classical mythology, Satan, Beelzebub,\r\nPrince of Darkness, and by many other titles. In his _Address to the\r\nDe'il_ Burns invokes him thus:\r\n\r\n   \"Oh, Thou! whatever title suit thee,--\r\n    Auld Hornie, Satan, Nick or Cloutie!\"\r\n\r\nHe has manifested himself in fiction under diverse names, as Demon,\r\nLucifer, Satan, Mephistopheles, Prince Lucio, The Man in Black, and so\r\nforth, but whatever the name he answers to, he is known in every land\r\nand has with astonishing adaptability made himself at home in every\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe devil has so changed his form and his manner of appearance in later\r\nliterature that it is hard to identify him as his ancient self. In\r\nearly stories he was heralded by supernatural thunder and lightning\r\nand accompanied by a strong smell of sulphur. He dressed in character\r\ncostume, sometimes in red, sometimes in black, but always indubitably\r\ndiabolic. He wore horns, a forked tail, and cloven hoofs and was a\r\ngenerally unprepossessing creature whom anyone could know for a devil.\r\nNow his rôle is not so typical and his garb not so declarative. He\r\nwears an evening suit, a scholar's gown, a parson's robe, a hunting\r\ncoat, with equal ease, and it is sometimes difficult to tell the devil\r\nfrom the hero of a modern story. He has been deodorized and no longer\r\nreeks warningly of the Pit.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval mind conceived of the devil as a sort of combination\r\nof mythologic satyr and religious dragon. It is interesting to note\r\nhow the pagan devil-myths have been engrafted upon the ideas of\r\nChristianity, to fade out very slowly and by degrees. In monkish\r\nlegends the devil was an energetic person who would hang round a likely\r\nsoul for years, if need be, on the chance of nabbing him. Many monkish\r\nlegends have come down to us.\r\n\r\nThe diabolic element in English folk-lore shows a rich field for study.\r\nThe devil here as in the monkish legendry appears as an enemy of souls,\r\na tireless tempter. He lies in wait for any unwary utterance, and the\r\nleast mention of his name, any thoughtless expletive, such as \"The\r\ndevil take me if--\" brings instant response from him to clinch the\r\nbargain. Yet the devil of rustic folk-lore is of a bucolic dullness,\r\nless clever than in any phase of literature, more gullible, more easily\r\nimposed on. English folk-lore, especially the Celtic branches, shows\r\nthe devil as very closely related to nature. He was wont to work off\r\nhis surplus energy or his wrath by disturbing the landscape, and many\r\nstories of his prankish pique have come down to us. If anything vexed\r\nhim he might stamp so hard upon a plain that the print of his cloven\r\nhoof would be imprinted permanently. He was fond of drinking out of\r\npure springs and leaving them cursed with sulphur, and he sometimes\r\nshowed annoyance by biting a section out of a mountain, Devil's Bit\r\nMountain in Ireland being one of the instances. In general, any\r\npeculiarity of nature might be attributed to the activities of Auld\r\nHornie.\r\n\r\nThe devil has always been a pushing, forward sort of person, so he\r\nwas not content with being handed round by word of mouth in monkish\r\nlegend or rustic folk-lore, but must worm his way into literature in\r\ngeneral. Since then many ink-pots have been emptied upon him besides\r\nthe one that Luther hurled against his cloister wall. The devil is seen\r\nfrequently in the miracle plays, showing grotesquerie, the beginnings\r\nof that sardonic humor he is to display in more important works later.\r\nIn his appearance in literature the devil is largely anthropomorphic.\r\nMan creates the devil in his own image, one who is not merely personal\r\nbut racial as well, reflecting his creator. In monkish tradition\r\nan adversary in wait for souls, in rustic folk-lore a rollicking\r\nbuffoon with waggish pranks, in miracle plays reflecting the mingled\r\nseriousness and comic elements of popular beliefs, he mirrors his\r\nmaker. But it is in the great poems and dramas and stories that we find\r\nthe more personal aspects of devil-production, and it is these epic\r\nand dramatic concepts of the devil that have greatly influenced modern\r\nfiction. While the Gothic romance was but lightly touched by the epic\r\nsupernaturalism, the literature since that time has reflected it more,\r\nand the Satanic characters of Dante, Milton, Calderon, Marlowe, and\r\nGoethe have cast long shadows over modern fiction. The recent revival\r\nof interest in Dante has doubtless had its effect here.\r\n\r\nBurns in his _Address to the De'il_ shows his own kindly heart and\r\nhonest though ofttimes misdirected impulses by suggesting that there\r\nis still hope for the devil to repent and trusting that he may do so\r\nyet. Mrs. Browning, in her _Drama of Exile_, likewise shows in Lucifer\r\nsome appeal to our sympathies, reflecting the pitying heart of the\r\nwriter,--showing a certain kinship to Milton's Satan yet with weakened\r\nintellectual power. She makes Gabriel say to him:\r\n\r\n                                    \"Angel of the sin,\r\n    Such as thou standest,--pale in the drear light\r\n    Which rounds the rebel's work with Maker's wrath--\r\n    Thou shalt be an Idea to all souls,\r\n    A monumental, melancholy gloom,\r\n    Seen down all ages whence to mark despair\r\n    And measure out the distances from good.\"\r\n\r\nByron's devil in _A Vision of Judgment_ is, like Caliban's ideas of\r\nSetebos, \"altogether such an one\" as Byron conceived himself to be. He\r\nis a terrible figure, whose\r\n\r\n   \"Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved\r\n    Eternal wrath on his immortal face.\"\r\n\r\nHe shows diabolical sarcasm when he says, \"I've kings enough below,\r\nGod knows!\" And how like Oscar Wilde is the devil he pictures to us\r\nin his symbolic story, _The Fisherman and his Soul_. The prince of\r\ndarkness who appears to the young fisherman that wishes to sell his\r\nsoul to the devil is \"a man dressed in a suit of black velvet cut in\r\nSpanish fashion. His proud face was strangely pale, but his lips were\r\nlike a proud red flower. He seemed weary and was leaning back toying in\r\na listless manner with the pommel of his saddle.\" When the fisherman\r\nunthoughtedly utters a prayer that baffles the fiend for the time,\r\nthe demon mounts his jennet with the silver harness and rides away,\r\nstill with the proud, disdainful face, sad with a _blasé_ weariness\r\nunlike the usual alertness of the devil. He has a sort of Blessed\r\nDamozel droop to his figure, and the bored patience of a lone man at an\r\nafternoon tea. Wilde shows us some little mocking red devils in another\r\nof his stories,[143] and _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ is a concept of\r\ndiabolism.\r\n\r\n      [143] _A Legend of Sharp._\r\n\r\nScott in _The Talisman_ puts a story of descent from the Evil One in\r\nthe mouth of the Saracen, the legend of the spirits of evil who formed\r\na league with the cruel Zohauk, by which he gained a daily sacrifice of\r\nblood to feed two hideous serpents that had become a part of himself.\r\nOne day seven sisters of wonderful beauty are brought, whose loveliness\r\nappeals to the immortals. In the midst of supernatural manifestations\r\nthe earth is rent and seven young men appear. The leader says to the\r\neldest sister:\r\n\r\n  I am Cothreb, king of the subterranean world. I and my brethren are\r\n  of those who, created out of elementary fire, disdained even at the\r\n  command of Omnipotence, to do homage to a clod of earth because it\r\n  is called man. Thou mayest have heard of us as cruel, unrelenting,\r\n  and persecuting. It is false. We are by nature kind and generous,\r\n  vengeful only when insulted, cruel only when affronted. We are true\r\n  to those that trust us; and we have heard the invocations of thy\r\n  father the sage Mithrasp, who wisely worships not only the Origin\r\n  of Good, but that which is called the Source of Evil. You and\r\n  your sisters are on the eve of death; but let each give to us one\r\n  hair from your fair tresses in token of fealty, and we will carry\r\n  you many miles to a place of safety where you may bid defiance to\r\n  Zohauk and his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe maidens accept the offer and become the brides of the spirits of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nThe devil in Scott's _Wandering Willie's Tale_,[144] also speaks a good\r\nword for himself. When the gudesire meets in the woods the stranger\r\nwho sympathizes with his obvious distress, the unknown offers to help\r\nhim, saying, \"If you will tell me your grief, I am one that, though I\r\nhave been sair miscaa'd in the world, am the only hand for helping my\r\nfreends.\" The gudesire tells his woes and says that he would go to the\r\ngates of hell, and farther, to get the receipt due him, upon which the\r\nhospitable stranger conducts him to the place mentioned. The canny\r\nScot obtains the document, outwits the devil, and wins his way back to\r\nearth unscathed.\r\n\r\n      [144] In _Red Gauntlet_.\r\n\r\nOne marked aspect of recent devil-fiction is the tendency to gloze over\r\nhis sins and to humanize him. This is shown to a marked degree in Marie\r\nCorelli's sentimental novel, _The Sorrows of Satan_, where she expends\r\nmuch anxious sympathy over the fiend. To Miss Corelli's agitated\r\nmind Satan is a much maligned martyr who regretfully tempts mortals\r\nand is grieved when they yield to his beguilements. Her perfervid\r\nrhetoric pictures him as a charming prince, handsome, wealthy, yet very\r\nlonesome, who warns persons in advance that he is not what he seems\r\nand that they would do well to avoid him. But the fools rush in crowds\r\nto be damned. According to her theory, the devil is attempting to work\r\nout his own salvation and could do so save for the weakness of man. He\r\nis able to get a notch nearer heaven for every soul that resists his\r\nwiles, though in London circles his progress is backward rather than\r\nforward. How is Lucifer fallen! To be made a hero of by Marie Corelli\r\nmust seem to Mephisto life's final indignity! Her characterization of\r\nthe fiend shows some reminiscence of a hasty reading of Milton, Goethe,\r\nand the Byronic Cain.\r\n\r\nThe devil has a human as well as dæmonic spirit in Israel Zangwill's\r\n_They that Walk in Darkness_, where he appears as Satan Maketrig, a\r\nred-haired hunchback, with \"gigantic marble brow, cold, keen, steely\r\neyes, and handsome, clean-shaven lips.\" He seems a normal human being\r\nin this realistic Ghetto setting, though he bears a nameless sense\r\nof evil about with him. In his presence, or as he passes by, all the\r\nlatent evil in men's souls comes to the surface. He lures the rabbi\r\naway from his wife, from God, and from all virtue, yet to see him at\r\nthe end turn away again in spirit to the good, spurning the tempter\r\nwhom he recognizes at last as dæmonic. There is a human anguish in the\r\neyes of Satan Maketrig, that shows him to be not altogether diabolic,\r\nand he seems mournful and appealing in his wild loneliness. His nature\r\nis in contrast to that of the fiend in Stanley J. Weyman's _The Man\r\nin Black_. Here his cold, sardonic jesting that causes him to play\r\nwith life and death, so lightly, his diabolic cunning, his knowledge\r\nof the human heart and how to torture it, remind us of Iago. The dark\r\nshade extends to the skin as well as to the heart in the man in black\r\nin Stevenson's _Thrawn Janet_, for he exercises a weird power over his\r\nvassal, the old servant, and terrifies even the minister. And _War\r\nLetters from a Living Dead Man_, written by Elsa Parker but said to be\r\ndictated by a correspondent presumably from somewhere in hell, shows us\r\nHis Satanic Majesty with grim realism up to date.\r\n\r\nThe devil appears with mournful, human dignity, yet with superhuman\r\ngigantism in Algernon Blackwood's _Secret Worship_, where the lost\r\nsouls enter into a riot of devil-worship, into which they seek to draw\r\nliving victims, to damn them body and soul. One victim sees the devil\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n  At the end of the room where the windows seemed to have disappeared\r\n  so that he could see the stars, there rose up into view, far\r\n  against the sky, grand and terrible, the outline of a man. A kind\r\n  of gray glory enveloped him so that it resembled a steel-cased\r\n  statue, immense, imposing, horrific in its distant splendor. The\r\n  gray radiance from its mightily broken visage, august and mournful,\r\n  beat down upon his soul, pulsing like some dark star with the\r\n  powers of spiritual evil.\r\n\r\nHere, as in many instances elsewhere, the sadness of the diabolic\r\ncharacter is emphasized, a definite human element. The Miltonic\r\ninfluence seems evident in such cases.\r\n\r\nKipling has a curious dæmonic study in _Bubble Well Road_, a story\r\nof a patch of ground filled with devils and ghosts controlled by an\r\nevil-minded native priest, while in _Haunted Subalterns_ the imps\r\nterrorize young army officers by their malicious mischief.\r\n\r\nThe allegorical and symbolic studies of diabolism are among the\r\nmore impressive creations in later fiction, as in Tolstoi's _Ivan,\r\nthe Fool_, where the demons are responsible for the marshaling of\r\narmies, the tyranny of money, and the inverted ideas of the value of\r\nservice. The appearance of the devil in later stories is more terrible\r\nand effective in its variance of type and its secret symbolism than\r\nthe crude enginery of diabolism in Gothic fiction, as the muscular\r\nfiend[145] that athletically hurls the man and woman from the mountain\r\ntop, or the invisible physical strength manifested in _Melmoth, the\r\nWanderer_. The crude violence of these novels is in keeping with the\r\nfiction of the time, yet modern stories show a distinct advance, as\r\nsuch instances as J. H. Shorthouse's _Countess Eve_, where the devil\r\nappears differently to each tempted soul, embodying with hideous\r\nwisdom the form of the sin that that particular soul is most liable\r\nto commit. He bears the shape of committed sin, suggesting that evil\r\nis so powerful as to have an independent existence of its own, apart\r\nfrom the mind that gave it birth, as the devil appears as evil thought\r\nmaterialized in Fernac Molnar's drama, _The Devil_. Fiona McLeod's\r\nstrange Gaelic tale, _The Sin-Eater_ introduces demons symbolically.\r\nThe sin-eater is a person that by an ancient formula can remove the\r\nsins from an unburied corpse and let them in turn be swept away from\r\nhim by the action of the pure air. But if the sin-eater hates the dead\r\nman, he has the power to fling the transgressions into the sea, to turn\r\nthem into demons that pursue and torment the flying soul till Judgment\r\nDay.\r\n\r\n      [145] In _The Monk_ or _Zofloya_.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the recent stories of diabolism is the subtleness by\r\nwhich the evil is suggested. The reader feels a miasmatic atmosphere\r\nof evil, a smear on the soul, and knows that certain incidents in the\r\naction can be accounted for on no other basis than that of dæmonic\r\npresence, as in Barry Pain's _Moon Madness_, where the princess is\r\nmoved by a strange irresistible lure to dance alone night after night\r\nin the heart of the secret labyrinth to mystic music that the white\r\nmoon makes. But one night, after she is dizzy and exhausted but\r\nimpelled to keep on, she feels a hot hand grasp hers; someone whirls\r\nher madly round and she knows that _she is not dancing alone_! She\r\nis seen no more of men, and searchers find only the prints of her\r\nlittle dancing slippers in the sand, with the mark of a cloven hoof\r\nbeside them. The most revolting instances of suggestive diabolism are\r\nfound in Arthur Machen's stories, where supernatural science opens\r\nthe way for the devil to enter the human soul, since the biologist\r\nby a cunning operation on the brain removes the moral sense, takes\r\naway the soul, and leaves a being absolutely diabolized. Worse still\r\nis the hideousness of _Seeing the Great God Pan_, where the dæmonic\r\ncharacter is a composite of the loathsome aspects of Pan and the devil,\r\nfrom which horrible paternity is born a child that embodies all the\r\nunspeakable evil in the world.\r\n\r\nIn pleasant contrast to dreadful stories are the tales of the amusing\r\ndevils that we find frequently. The comic devil is much older than\r\nthe comic ghost, as authors showed a levity toward demons long before\r\nthey treated the specter with disrespect,--one rather wonders why.\r\nClownish devils that appeared in the miracle plays prepared the way for\r\nthe humorous and satiric treatment of the Elizabethan drama and late\r\nfiction. The liturgical imps were usually funny whether their authors\r\nintended them as such or not, but the devils in fiction are quite\r\nconscious of their own wit, in fact, are rather conceited about it.\r\nPoe shows us several amusing demons who display his curious satiric\r\nhumor,--for instance, the old gentleman in _Never Bet the Devil your\r\nHead_. When Toby Dammit makes his rash assertion, he beholds\r\n\r\n  the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect.\r\n  Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance; for he\r\n  not only had on a full suit of black, but his shirt was perfectly\r\n  clean and the collar turned down very neatly over a white cravat,\r\n  while his hair was parted in front like a girl's. His hands were\r\n  clasped pensively over his stomach, and his two eyes were carefully\r\n  rolled up into the top of his head.\r\n\r\nThis clerical personage who reminds us of the devil in _Peer Gynt_, who\r\nalso appears as a parson, claims the better's head and neatly carries\r\nit off. This is a modern version of an incident similar to Chaucer's\r\n_Friar's Tale_, where the devil claimed whatever was offered him in\r\nsincerity. The combination of humor and mystery in Washington Irving's\r\n_The Devil and Tom Walker_ shows the black woodsman in an amusing\r\nthough terrifying aspect, as he claims the keeping of the contracts\r\nmade with him by Tom and his miserly wife. When Tom goes to search for\r\nhis spouse in the woods, he fails to find her.\r\n\r\n  She had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had\r\n  been accustomed to deal with her husband; but though the female\r\n  scold is generally considered a match for the devil, yet in this\r\n  instance she appears to have had the worst of it. She must have\r\n  died game, however, for it is said Tom noticed many prints of\r\n  cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and found handsful of\r\n  hair that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse shock\r\n  of the black woodsman. Tom knew his wife's prowess by experience.\r\n  He shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the fierce signs of\r\n  clapper-clawing. \"Egad!\" he said to himself, \"Old Scratch must have\r\n  had a tough time of it!\"\r\n\r\nThe devil amuses himself in various ways, as is seen by the antics of\r\nthe mysterious stranger in Poe's _The Devil in the Belfry_, who comes\r\ncurvetting into the old Dutch village with his audacious and sinister\r\nface and curious costume, to upset the sacred time of the place. The\r\nvisitant in _Bon Bon_ is likewise queer as to dress and habits. He\r\nwears garments in the style of a century before, having a queue but\r\nno shirt, a cravat with an ecclesiastic suggestion, also a stylus\r\nand black book. His facial expression is such as would have struck\r\nUriah Heap dumb with envy, and the hint of hoofs and a forked tail is\r\ncleverly given though not obtruded. The most remarkable feature of his\r\nappearance, however, is that he has no eyes, simply a dead level of\r\nflesh. He declares that he eats souls and prefers to buy them alive to\r\ninsure freshness. He has a taste for philosophers, when they are not\r\ntoo tough.\r\n\r\nThe satiric devil, like the satiric ghost, is seen in modern fiction.\r\nEugene Field has a story of a demon who seems sympathetic, weeping\r\nlarge, gummy tears at hearing a mortal's woes, and signing the\r\nconventional contract on a piece of asbestos paper. He agrees to do\r\neverything the man wishes, for a certain term of years, in return for\r\nwhich he is to get the soul. If the devil forfeits the contract, he\r\nloses not only that victim but the souls of two thousand already in his\r\nclutches. The man shrewdly demands trying things of him, but the demon\r\nis game, building and endowing churches, carrying on philanthropic and\r\nreform work without complaint, but balking when the man asks him to\r\nclose the saloons on Sunday. Rather than do that, he releases the two\r\nthousand and one souls and flies away twitching his tail in wrath.[146]\r\n\r\n      [146] _Daniel and the Devil._\r\n\r\nThe most recent, as perhaps the most striking, instance of the satiric\r\ndevil is in Mark Twain's posthumous novel, _The Mysterious Stranger_. A\r\nyouth, charming, courtly, and handsome appears in a medieval village,\r\nconfessing to two boys that he is Satan, though not the original of\r\nthat name, but his nephew and namesake. He insists that he is an\r\nunfallen angel, since his uncle is the only member of his family that\r\nhas sinned. Satan reads the thoughts of mortals, kindles fire in his\r\npipe by breathing on it, supplies money and other desirable things by\r\nmere suggestion, is invisible when he wills it so, and is generally\r\na gifted being. This perennial boy--only sixteen thousand years\r\nold--makes a charming companion. He says to Marget that his papa is in\r\nshattered health and has no property to speak of,--in fact, none of any\r\nearthly value,--but he has an uncle in business down in the tropics,\r\nwho is very well off, and has a monopoly, and it is from this uncle\r\nthat he drew his support. Marget expresses the hope that her uncle and\r\nhis would meet some day, and Satan says he hoped so, too. \"May be they\r\nwill,\" says Marget. \"Does your uncle travel much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, he goes all about,--he has business everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe book is full of this oblique humor, satirizing earth, heaven, and\r\nhell. The stranger by his comments on theological creeds satirizes\r\nreligion, and Satan is an intended parody of God. He sneers at man's\r\n\"mongrel moral sense,\" which tells him the distinction between good and\r\nevil, insisting that he should have no choice, that the right to choose\r\nmakes him inevitably choose the wrong. He makes little figures out of\r\nclay and gives them life, only to destroy them with casual ruthlessness\r\na little later and send them to hell. In answer to the old servant's\r\nfaith in God, when she says that He will care for her and her mistress,\r\nsince \"not a sparrow falleth to the ground without His Knowledge,\"\r\nhe sneers, \"But it falls, just the same! What's the good of seeing it\r\nfall?\" He is a new diabolic figure, yet showing the composite traits of\r\nthe old, the dæmonic wisdom and sarcasm, the superhuman magnetism to\r\ndraw men to him, and the human qualities of geniality, sympathy, and\r\nboyish charm.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant and frequent motifs of the diabolic in\r\nliterature is that of the barter of the human soul for the devil's\r\ngift of some earthly boon, long life or wealth or power, or wisdom,\r\nor gratification of the senses. It is a theme of unusual power,--what\r\ncould be greater than the struggle over one's own immortal soul?--and\r\nwell might the great minds of the world engage themselves with it.\r\nYet that theme is but little apparent in later stories. We have no\r\nsuch character in recent literature that can compare with Marlowe's\r\nDr. Faustus or Goethe's Mephistopheles or Calderon's wonder-working\r\nmagician. Hawthorne's Septimius Felton makes a bargain with the devil\r\nto secure the elixir of life, there is a legend in Hardy's _Tess of the\r\nD' Urbervilles_ of a man that sold himself to the minister of evil,\r\nand the incident occurs in various stories of witchcraft, yet with\r\nwaning power and less frequence. The most significant recent use of it\r\nis in W. B. Yeats's drama.[147] This is a drama of Ireland, where the\r\npeasants have been driven by famine to barter their souls to the devil\r\nto buy their children food, but their Countess sells her own soul to\r\nthe demon that they may save theirs. This vicarious sacrifice adds a\r\nnew poignancy to the situation and Yeats has treated it with power.\r\nThis is the only recent appearance of the devil on the stage for he\r\nhas practically disappeared from English drama, where he was once so\r\nprominent. The demon was a familiar and leading figure on the miracle\r\nand Elizabethan stage, but, like the ghost, he shows more vitality now\r\nin fiction. The devil is an older figure in English drama than is the\r\nghost, but he seems to have played out.\r\n\r\n      [147] _Countess Cathleen._\r\n\r\nThe analysis and representation of the devil as a character in\r\nliterature have covered a great range, from the bestiality of Dante's\r\nDemon in the _Inferno_ to Milton's mighty angel in ruins, with all\r\nsorts of variations between, from the sneering cynicism of Goethe's\r\nMephisto to the pinchbeck diabolism of Marie Corelli's sorrowful Satan,\r\nand the merry humor and blasphemous satire of Mark Twain's mysterious\r\nstranger. We note an especial influence of Goethe's Mephistopheles\r\nin the satiric studies of the demon, an echo of his diabolic climax\r\nwhen in answer to Faust's outcry over Margaret's downfall and death,\r\nhe says, \"_She is not the first_!\" One hears echoing through all\r\nliterature Man Friday's unanswerable question, \"Why not God kill\r\ndebbil?\" The uses of evil in God's eternal scheme, the soul's free\r\nchoice yet pitiful weakness, are sounded again and again. The great\r\ndiabolic figures, in their essential humanity, their intellectual\r\ndignity, their sad introspection, their pitiless testing of the human\r\nsoul to its predestined fall, are terrible allegorical images of the\r\nevil in man himself, or concepts of social sins, as in _Ivan, the\r\nFool_. The devils of the great writers, reflecting the time, the racial\r\ncharacteristics, the personal natures of their creators, are deeply\r\nsymbolic. Each man creates the devil that he can understand, that\r\nrepresents him, for, as Amiel says, we can comprehend nothing of which\r\nwe have not the beginnings in ourselves. As each man sees a different\r\nHamlet, so each one has his own devil, or _is_ his own devil. This is\r\nillustrated by the figure in Julian Hawthorne's _Lovers in Heaven_,\r\nwhere the dead man's spirit meets the devil in the after life,--who is\r\nhis own image, his dæmonic double. Some have one great fiend, while\r\nothers keep packs of little, snarling imps of darkness. A study of\r\ncomparative diabolics is illuminating and might be useful to us all.\r\n\r\n=The Wizard and the Witch.= The demon has his earthly partners in evil\r\nmembers of the firm of Devil and Company. Certain persons that have\r\nmade a pact with him are given a share in his power, and a portion of\r\nhis dark mantle falls upon them. The sorcerer and the witch are ancient\r\nfigures in literature, and like others of the supernatural kingdom,\r\nnotably the devil, they have their origin in the East, the cuneiform\r\nwritings of the Chaldeans showing belief in witchcraft. And the Witch\r\nof Endor, summoning the spirit of Samuel to confront Saul, is a very\r\nreal figure in the Old Testament. The Greeks believed in witches, as\r\ndid the Romans. Meroe, a witch, is described in the _Metamorphoses_ of\r\nLucius Appuleius, from whom perhaps the witch Meroe in Peele's _Old\r\nWives' Tale_ gets her name and character. In classical times witches\r\nwere thought to have power to turn men into beasts, tigers, monkeys, or\r\nasses--some persons still believe that women have that power and might\r\ngive authenticated instances.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer, or wizard, or warlock, or magician, as he is variously\r\ncalled, was a more common figure in early literature than in later,\r\nperhaps because, as in so many other cases, his profession has suffered\r\na feminine invasion. The Anglo-Saxon word _wicca_, meaning \"witch,\" is\r\nmasculine, which may or may not mean that witchcraft was a manly art in\r\nthose days, and the most famous medieval enchanter, Merlin, was a man,\r\nit should be noted. The sorcerer of primitive times has been gradually\r\nreduced in power, changing through the astrologer and alchemist of\r\nmedieval and Gothic romance into the bacteriologist and biologist of\r\nrecent fiction, where he works other wonders. In general, warlocks\r\nand wizards, while frequent enough in early literature and in modern\r\nfolk-tales, have become less numerous in later fiction. Scott[148]\r\nhas a medical magician with supernatural power of healing by means of\r\nan amulet, which, put to the nostrils of a person practically dead,\r\nrevives him at once, but which loses its efficacy if given in exchange\r\nfor money. Hawthorne has an old Indian sachem with wizard power,[149]\r\nwho has concocted the elixir of life. We see the passing of the ancient\r\nsorcerer into the scientific wonder-worker in such fiction as Sax\r\nRohmer's Fu-Manchu stories that depict a Chinese terror, or in H. G.\r\nWells's supernatural investigators in his various stories of science.\r\nThe magician is not really dead in fiction but has passed over into\r\nanother form, for the most part.\r\n\r\n      [148] In _The Talisman_.\r\n\r\n      [149] In his _Septimius Felton_.\r\n\r\nWe still have the hoodoo man of colored persuasion, and the redskin\r\nmedicine-man, together with Oriental sorcerers from Kipling and\r\nothers. Examples are: _In the House of Suddoo_, by Kipling, where the\r\nwonder-worker unites a canny knowledge of the telephone and telegraph\r\nalong with his unholy art; _Red Debts_, by Lumley Deakin, where the\r\nIndian magician exacts a terrible penalty for the wrong done him, and\r\nwhere his diabolic appearance to claim his victim leaves one in doubt\r\nas to whether he has not sent his chief in his place; _The Monkey's\r\nPaw_, by W. W. Jacobs, a curdling story of a magic curse given by an\r\nOriental sorcerer, by which the paw of a dead monkey grants three\r\nwishes that have a dreadful boomerang power; _Black Magic_, by Jessie\r\nAdelaide Weston,--who claims that all her supernatural stories are\r\nstrictly true--the narrative of an old Indian sorcerer that changes\r\nhimself into a hair mat and is shot for his pains. He has obtained\r\npower over the house by being given a hair from the mat by the\r\nuninitiated mistress. Hair, you must know, has great power of evil in\r\nthe hands of witches and sorcerers, as in the case of the evil ones in\r\n_The Talisman_, who received their thrall over the maidens by one hair\r\nfrom each head. F. Marion Crawford's _Khaled_ is a story of magic art.\r\nKhaled is one of the genii converted by reading the Koran, who wishes\r\nto be a mortal man with a soul. He is given the right to do so if he\r\ncan win the love of a certain woman. Hence he is born into the world,\r\nlike Adam, a full-grown man, to be magically clothed and equipped, by\r\nthe transformation of leaves and twigs into garments and armor, and the\r\nchanging of a locust into an Arabian steed. After many supernatural\r\nadventures, he receives his soul from an angel. The soul, at first a\r\ncrescent flame,\r\n\r\n  immediately took shape and became the brighter image of Khaled\r\n  himself. And when he had looked at it fixedly for a few\r\n  minutes--the vision of himself had disappeared and before he was\r\n  aware it had entered his own body and taken up its life with him.\r\n\r\nThis is a parallel to the cases of ghostly doubles discussed in the\r\nprevious chapter.\r\n\r\nThe magician shows a disposition to adapt himself to contemporary\r\nconditions and to change his personality with the times. Not so the\r\nwitch. She is a permanent figure. She has appeared in the various\r\nforms of literature, in Elizabethan drama, in Gothic romance, in\r\nmodern poetry, the novel and the short story, and is very much alive\r\nto-day. We have witches young and old. We have the fake witch, like the\r\nhoax ghost; the imputed witch and the genuine article. We have witch\r\nstories melodramatic, romantic, tragic, comic, and satiric, showing\r\nthe influence of the great creations of past literature with modern\r\nadaptations and additions. English poetry is full of witchery, perhaps\r\nlargely the result of the Celtic influence on our literature. The\r\npoetic type of witchcraft is brought out in such poems as Coleridge's\r\n_Christabel_, where the beauty and suggestiveness veil the sense of\r\nunearthly evil; or in Shelley's _Witch of Atlas_, where the woman\r\nappears as a symbol of alluring loveliness possessing none of the\r\nhideous aspects seen in other weird women. The water enchantress in\r\nShelley's fragment of an unfinished drama might be mentioned as another\r\nexample while Keats's _La Belle Dame sans Merci_ has a magical charm\r\nall her own. Christina Rossetti's _Goblin Market_ shows a peculiar\r\naspect of magic, as also Mrs. Browning's _The Lay of the Brown Rosary_.\r\nOn the contrary, Milton's _Comus_, Robert Herrick's _The Hag_, and\r\nJames Hogg's _The Witch of Fife_ illustrate the uglier aspects of\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\nThere are two definite types of witches seen in English fiction, the\r\nfirst being merely the reputed witch, the woman who is falsely accused\r\nor suspected of black arts, and who either is persecuted, or else gains\r\nwhat she wishes by hints of her traffic in evil, like the Old Granny\r\nYoung in _Mine Host and the Witch_, by James Blythe, who chants as a\r\ncharm-rune,\r\n\r\n   \"A curse shall lay on water and land\r\n    For the thing denied the witch's hand,\"\r\n\r\nso that everybody is afraid to refuse her whatever she demands. This\r\nis a highly conventionalized type of the motif and, though it is found\r\nin great numbers in modern fiction, is not particularly important. The\r\nprincipal complications of the plot are usually the same, the character\r\nknown as the witch being either an appealing figure winning sympathy\r\nbecause of her beauty and youth, or else touching to pity because of\r\nher age and infirmities. No person of average age or pulchritude is\r\never accused of witchcraft in English fiction. She is always very\r\nold and poor or young and lovely. Item also, she invariably has two\r\nlovers, in the latter case. She is merely a romantic peg on which to\r\nhang a story, not always real as a human being and not a real witch.\r\nIn these stories the only magic used is love, the fair maid having\r\nunintentionally charmed the heart of a villain, who, failing to win\r\nher, accuses her of witchcraft in order to frighten her into love.\r\nIn some of the novels and stories the victim is actually executed,\r\nwhile in others she is rescued by her noble lover at the fifty-ninth\r\nsecond. We have the pursuing villain, the distressed innocence, the\r\nchivalric lover disporting themselves in late Gothic fashion over\r\nmany romances. Even Mary Johnston with her knowledge of Colonial\r\ntimes and her power to give atmosphere to the past does not succeed\r\nin imparting the breath of life to her late novel of witchcraft,\r\n_The Witch_. These pink-and-white beauties who speak in Euphuistic\r\nsentences, who show a lamblike defiance toward the dark tempters,\r\nwho breathe prayers to heaven for protection and forgiveness to\r\ntheir enemies in one breath, who die or are rescued with equal grace\r\nand propriety,--one is carried away from the scaffold by Kidd, the\r\npirate, thus delaying for several chapters her rescue by her faithful\r\nlover--do not really touch the heart any more than they interest the\r\nintellect. Yet there are occasional instances of the imputed witch\r\nwho seems real despite her handicap of beauty and youth, as Iseult le\r\nDesireuse, in Maurice Hewlett's _Forest Lovers_, whom Prosper le Gai\r\nweds to save from the hangman. The young woman in F. Marion Crawford's\r\n_Witch of Prague_ might be called a problematic witch, for while she\r\ndoes undoubtedly work magic, it is for the most part attributed to her\r\npowers of hypnotism rather than to the black art itself. We find an\r\nexcellent example of the reputed witch who is a woman of real charm\r\nand individuality, in D'Annunzio's _The Daughter of Jorio_, where the\r\nyoung girl is beset by cruel dangers because of her charm and her\r\nlonely condition, and who rises to tragic heights of sacrifice to save\r\nher lover from death, choosing to be burned to death as a witch to save\r\nhim from paying the penalty of murder. She actually convinces him, as\r\nwell as the others, that she has bewitched him by unholy powers, that\r\nshe has slain his father and made him believe that he himself did it\r\nto save her honor, and she goes to her death with a white fervor of\r\ncourage, with no word of complaint, save one gentle rebuke to him that\r\n_he_ should not revile her.\r\n\r\nThe aged pseudo-witch is in the main more appealing than the young\r\none, because more realistic. Yet there is no modern instance that is\r\nso touching as the poor old crone in _The Witch of Edmonton_, who is\r\npersecuted for being a witch and who turns upon her tormentors with a\r\nspeech that reminds us of Shylock's famous outcry, showing clearly how\r\ntheir suspicion and accusation have made her what she is. We see here\r\na witch in the making, an innocent old woman who is harried by human\r\nbeings till she makes a compact with the devil. Meg Merrilies[150] is\r\na problematic witch, a majestic, sibylline figure, very individual\r\nand human, yet with more than a suggestion of superhuman wisdom and\r\npower. Scott limned her with a loving hand, and Keats was so impressed\r\nwith her personality that he wrote a poem concerning her. Elizabeth\r\nEnderfield, in Hardy's _Under the Greenwood Tree_, is a reputed witch\r\nand witch-pricking is also tried in his _Return of the Native_. Various\r\nexperiments with magic are used in Hardy's work, as the instance of\r\nthe woman's touching her withered arm to the neck of a man that had\r\nbeen hanged, consulting the conjurer concerning butter that won't come,\r\nand so forth. Old Aunt Keziah in Hawthorne's _Septimius Felton_ might\r\nbe called a problematic witch, as the woman in _The Witch_ by Eden\r\nPhillpotts. She has a great number of cats, and something dreadful\r\nhappens to anyone who injures one of them; she calls the three black\r\ntoads her servants and goes through incantations over a snake skeleton,\r\nthe carcass of a toad, and the mummy of a cat. Mother Tab may or may\r\nnot be a _bona fide_ witch, but she causes much trouble to those\r\nassociated with her.\r\n\r\n      [150] Of Scott's _Guy Mannering_.\r\n\r\nThe unquestioned witch, possessing indubitable powers of enchantment,\r\noccurs frequently and conveys a genuine thrill. Her attributes have\r\nbeen less conventionalized than those of her youthful companions who\r\nare merely under the imputation of black art, and she possesses a\r\ndiabolic individuality. Though she may not remain long in view, she\r\nis an impressive figure not soon forgotten. The old crone in Scott's\r\n_The Two Drovers_ gives warning to Robin Oig, \"walking the deasil,\" as\r\nit is called, around him, tracing the propitiation which some think a\r\nreminiscence of Druidical mythology,--which is performed by walking\r\nthree times round the one in danger, moving according to the course of\r\nthe sun. In the midst of her incantation the hag exclaims, \"Blood on\r\nyour hand, and it is English blood!\" True enough, before his journey's\r\nend young Robin does murder his English companion. In the same story\r\nother evidences of witchcraft are shown, as the directions for keeping\r\naway the evil influence from cattle by tying St. Mungo's knot on their\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nThe subject of witchcraft greatly interested Hawthorne, for he\r\nintroduces it in a number of instances. _Young Goodman Brown_ shows\r\nthe aspects of the diabolic union between the devil and his earthly\r\ncompanions, their unholy congregations in the forest, reports their\r\nsardonic conversations and suggestions of evil in others, and pictures\r\nthe witches riding on broomsticks high in the heavens and working\r\ntheir magic spells. The young husband sees in that convocation all\r\nthe persons whom he has most revered--his minister, his Sabbath-school\r\nteacher, and even his young wife, so that all his after-life is\r\nsaddened by the thought of it. Witchcraft enters into _The Scarlet\r\nLetter_, _Main Street_, and _Feathertop_, and is mentioned in other\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Sheehy in Kipling's _The Courting of Dinah Shadd_\r\npronounces a malediction against Private Mulvany and the girl he\r\nloves, prophesying that he will be reduced in rank instead of being\r\npromoted, will be a slave to drink so that his young wife will take\r\nin washing for officers' wives instead of herself being the wife of\r\nan officer, and that their only child will die,--every bitter word\r\nof which comes true in after years. The old witch mother in Howard\r\nPyle's _The Evil Eye_ inspires her daughter to cast a spell over the\r\nman she loves but who does not think of her, causing him to leave his\r\nbetrothed and wed the witch daughter. When understanding comes to him,\r\nand with it loathing, the girl seeks to regain his love by following\r\nthe counsel of an old magician, who gives her an image to be burnt. But\r\nthat burning of the image kills her and looses the man from her spell.\r\nThat incident is similar to that in D'Annunzio's _Sogno d'un Tramonto\r\nd'Autunno_ where the Dogaressa seeks to slay her rival, both probably\r\nbeing based on the unforgettable employment of the theme in Rossetti's\r\n_Sister Helen_, where the young girl causes the death of her betrayer\r\nby melting the image.\r\n\r\nIn Gordon Bottomley's play, _Riding to Lithend_, three old women\r\nenter, who seem to partake of the nature of the Parcæ as well as of\r\nShakespeare's Weird Sisters. They have bat-webbed fingers, the hound\r\nbays uncannily at their approach, they show supernatural knowledge\r\nof events, and they chant a wild prophecy of doom, then mysteriously\r\ndisappear. Fate marches swiftly on as they foretell.\r\n\r\nThe young and beautiful witch can work as much evil as the ancient\r\ncrone, perhaps more, since her emotions are wilder and more\r\nunrestrained. She can project a curse that reaches its victim across\r\nthe ocean, when the one who sent the curse is rotting in the tomb, as\r\nin _The Curse of the Cashmere Shawl_, where a betrayed and deserted\r\nwoman in India sends a rare shawl to her rival, then drowns herself.\r\nMonths after, when the husband, forgetful of the source, lays the shawl\r\naround his wife's shoulders, the dead woman takes her place. After this\r\ngruesome transfer of personality, the wife, impelled by a terrible urge\r\nshe cannot understand, drowns herself as the other has done months\r\nbefore. Oscar Wilde[151] shows a young and lovely witch with a human\r\nlonging for the love of the young man who throws away his soul for\r\nlove of a mermaid. Through life's tragic satire, she is compelled, in\r\nspite of her entreaties, to show him how he may damn himself and win\r\nthe other's affection. The jealousy shown here and in other instances\r\nis an illustration of the human nature of the witch, who, like the\r\ndevil, makes a strong appeal to our sympathy in spite of the undoubted\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n      [151] In _The Fisherman and his Soul_.\r\n\r\nThe element of symbolism enters largely into the witch-creations, even\r\nfrom the time of Shakespeare's Three in _Macbeth_, who are terrible\r\nsymbolic figures of the evil in man's soul. They appear as the visible\r\nembodiment of Macbeth's thoughts, and by their mysterious suggestive\r\nutterances tempt him to put his unlawful dreams into action. They seem\r\nboth cause and effect here, for though when they first appear to him\r\nhis hands are innocent of blood, his heart is tainted with selfish\r\nambition, and their whispers of promise hurry on the deed. In _Ancient\r\nSorceries_, by Algernon Blackwood, the village is full of persons who\r\nat night by the power of an ancestral curse, a heritage of subliminal\r\nmemory, become witches, horrible cat-creatures, unhuman, that dance\r\nthe blasphemous dance of the Devil's Sabbath. The story symbolizes the\r\neternal curse that rests upon evil, the undying quality of thought and\r\naction that cannot cease when the body of the sinner has become dust,\r\nbut reaches out into endless generations.\r\n\r\nIn _Old Fires and Profitable Ghosts_ by A. T. Quiller-Couch, we see a\r\nwitch, a young woman whose soul is under a spell from the devil. She\r\ngives rich gifts to the church, but her offerings turn into toads and\r\nvipers, defiling the sanctuary, and as she sings her wild songs the\r\nbodies of drowned men come floating to the surface of the water and\r\njoin in the words of her song. Her beauty is supernatural and accursed,\r\nyet her soul is innocent of wish to do evil, though it leaves her body\r\nand goes like a cresseted flame at night to follow the devil, while the\r\nbody is powerless in sleep. Finally the devil comes in the form of a\r\nMoor, possibly a suggestion from _Zofloya_, and summons her, when she\r\ndies, with a crucifix clasped over her heart.\r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats has pictured several witches for us, as the crone of the\r\ngray hawk, in _The Wisdom of the King_, a woman tall with more than\r\nmortal height, with feathers of the gray hawk growing in her hair,\r\nwho stoops over the royal cradle and whispers a strange thing to the\r\nchild, as a result of which he grows up in a solitude of his own mystic\r\nthoughts with dreams that are like the marching and counter-marching\r\nof armies. When he realizes that the simple joys of life and love are\r\nnot for him, he disappears, some say to make his home with the immortal\r\ndemons, some say with the shadowy goddesses that haunt the midnight\r\npools in the forest. In _The Curse of the Fires and the Shadows_, Yeats\r\npictures another witch, tall and in a gray gown, who is standing in the\r\nriver and washing, washing the dead body of a man. As the troopers who\r\nhave murdered the friars and burned down the church ride past, each man\r\nrecognizes in the dead face his own face,--just a moment before they\r\nall plunge over the abyss to death.\r\n\r\nThere are witches in most collections of English folk-tales, for the\r\nsimpler people, the more elemental natures, have a strong feeling for\r\nthe twilight of nature and of life. The weird woman has power over the\r\nforces of nature and can evoke the wrath of the elements as of unholy\r\npowers against her enemies. Stories of witches, as of sorcerers, occur\r\nin Indian folk-tales, as well as in those of the American Indian,\r\ndiffering in details in the tribal collections yet showing similar\r\nessential ideas. The Scotch show special predilection for the witch,\r\nsince with their tense, stern natures, they stand in awe of the darker\r\npowers and of those that call them forth. They relate curious instances\r\nof the relations between the animal world and witchcraft, as in _The\r\nDark Nameless One_, by Fiona McLeod, the story of a nun that falls in\r\nlove with a seal and is forced to live forever in the sea, weaving her\r\nspells where the white foam froths, and knowing that her soul is lost.\r\nThis is akin to the theme that Matthew Arnold uses,[152] though with a\r\ndifferent treatment, showing similarity to Hans Christian Andersen's\r\ntale of _The Little Mermaid_. The cailleachuisge, or the water-witch,\r\nand the maighdeanmhara, the mermaid, and the kelpie, the sea-beast,\r\nare cursed with dæmonic spells and live forever in their witchery.\r\nWhen mortals forsake the earth and follow them their children are\r\nbeings that have no souls. The Irish folk-tales, on the other hand,\r\nwhile having their quota of witches, do not think so much about them\r\nor take them quite so seriously, inclining more to the faëry forms of\r\nsupernaturalism suited to their poetic natures. The sense of beauty\r\nof the Irish is so vivid and their innate poetry so intense that they\r\nglimpse the loveliness of magic, and their enchanted beings are of\r\nbeauty rather than of horror.\r\n\r\n      [152] In his _Forsaken Merman_ and _The Neckan_.\r\n\r\nWe even have the humorous and satiric witch, to correspond to similar\r\nrepresentations of the ghost and the devil in modern fiction. The\r\ninstance in Burns's _Tam O'Shanter_ needs only to be recalled, with the\r\nludicrous description of the wild race at night to escape the dread\r\npowers. _Bones, Sanders, and Another_, by Edgar Wallace, introduces a\r\nwitch with comic qualities, a woman whose husband has been a magician,\r\nand the reputed familiar of a devil. She cures people by laying her\r\nhands on them, once causing a bone that was choking a child to fly\r\nout with \"a cry terrible to hear, such a cry as a leopard makes when\r\npursued by ghosts.\" When this witch with a sense of humor is arrested\r\nas a trouble-maker by an army officer, she \"eradicates\" her clothes,\r\ncausing very comic complications. The best example of the satiric witch\r\nis Hawthorne's Mother Rigby, in _Feathertop_, who constructs a man\r\nfrom a broomstick and other materials for a scarecrow. In this satiric\r\nsermon upon the shams and hypocrisies of life, Mother Rigby, with her\r\nsardonic humor, her cynical comments, parodies society, holds the\r\nmirror up to human life and shows more than one poor painted scarecrow,\r\nsimulacrum of humanity, masquerading as a man. The figure that she\r\ncreates, with his yearnings and his pride, his horror when he realizes\r\nhis own falsity and emptiness, is more human, more a man, than many a\r\nbeing we meet in literature or in life.\r\n\r\nBarry Pain has several witch stories that do not fall readily into any\r\ncategory, curious stories of scientific dream-supernaturalism, in the\r\nrealm of the unreal. _Exchange_ is the account of a supernatural woman,\r\nwhether a witch or one of the Fates, one does not know, who comes,\r\nclad in scarlet rags, to show human souls their destinies. She permits\r\nan exchange of fate, if one is willing to pay her price, which is in\r\neach case terrible enough. One young girl gives up her pictured future\r\nof life and love, and surrenders her mind for the purpose of saving her\r\nbaby brother from his destined fate of suicide in manhood. The crone\r\nappears to an old man that loves the child, who takes upon himself her\r\nfate of being turned into a bird to be tortured after human death, so\r\nthat the young girl may have his future, to be turned into a white lamb\r\nthat dies after an hour, then be a soul set free. _The Glass of Supreme\r\nMoments_ is another story of prophetic witchery, of revealed fate seen\r\nin supernatural dreams. A young man in his college study sees the\r\nfireplace turn into a silver stairway down which a lovely gray-robed\r\nwoman comes to him. She shows him a mirror, the glass of supreme\r\nmoments, in which the highest instants of each man's life are shown.\r\nShe says of it, \"All the ecstasy of the world lies there. The supreme\r\nmoments of each man's life, the scene, the spoken words--all lie there.\r\nPast and present and future--all are there.\" She shows an emotion\r\nmeter that measures the thrill of joy. After he has seen the climactic\r\ninstants of his friends' lives he asks to see his own, when she tells\r\nhim his are here and now. She tells him that her name is Death and that\r\nhe will die if he kisses her, but he cries out, \"I will die kissing\r\nyou!\" And presently his mates return to find his body fallen dead\r\nacross his table.\r\n\r\nThere is something infinitely appealing about the character of the\r\nwitch. She seems a creature of tragic loneliness, conscious of her\r\nown dark powers, yet conscious also of her exile from the good, and\r\nknowing that all the evil she evokes will somehow come back to her,\r\nthat her curses will come home, as in the case of _Witch Hazel_, where\r\nthe witch, by making a cake of hair to overcome her rival in love,\r\nbrings on a tempest that kills her lover and drives her mad. Each evil\r\nact, each dark imagining seems to create a demon and turn him loose\r\nto harry humanity with unceasing force, as Matthew Maule's curse in\r\n_The House of Seven Gables_ casts a spiritual shadow on the home. Yet\r\nthe witch is sometimes a minister of good, as Mephistopheles says of\r\nhimself, achieving the good where he meant evil; sometimes typifying\r\nthe mysterious mother nature, as the old Wittikin in Hauptmann's\r\n_Sunken Bell_, neither good nor evil, neither altogether human nor\r\nsupernatural. Her strange symbolism is always impressive.\r\n\r\n=Dæmonic Spirits--Vampires.= Closely related to the devil are certain\r\ndiabolic spirits that are given supernatural power by him and\r\nacknowledge his suzerainty. These include ghouls, vampires, werewolves,\r\nand other demoniac animals, as well as the human beings that through a\r\ncompact with the fiend share in his dark force. Since such creatures\r\npossess dramatic possibilities, they have given interest to fiction\r\nand other literature from early times. This idea of an unholy alliance\r\nbetween earth and hell, has fascinated the human mind and been\r\nreflected astonishingly in literature. In studying the appearance of\r\nthese beings in English fiction, we note, as in the case of the ghost,\r\nthe witch, and the devil, a certain leveling influence, a tendency to\r\nhumanize them and give them characteristics that appeal to our sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe vampire and the ghoul are closely related and by some authorities\r\nare considered the same, yet there is a distinction. The ghoul is a\r\nbeing, to quote Poe, \"neither man nor woman, neither brute nor human\"\r\nthat feeds upon corpses, stealing out at midnight for loathsome\r\nbanquets in graveyards. He devours the flesh of the dead, while the\r\nvampire drains the blood of the living. The ghoul is an Asiatic\r\ncreature and has left but slight impress upon English literature,\r\nwhile the vampire has been a definite motif. The vampire superstition\r\ngoes back to ancient times, being referred to on Chaldean and Assyrian\r\ntablets. William of Newbury, of the twelfth century in England, relates\r\nseveral stories of them; one vampire was burned in Melrose Abbey, and\r\ntourists in Ireland are still shown the grave of a vampire. Perhaps the\r\nvampire superstition goes back to the savagery of remote times, and is\r\nan animistic survival of human sacrifices, of cannibalism and the like.\r\nThe vampire is thought of as an evil spirit issuing forth at night to\r\nattack the living in their sleep and drain the blood which is necessary\r\nto prolong its own revolting existence. Certain persons were thought\r\nto be especially liable to become vampires at death, such as suicides,\r\nwitches, wizards, persons who in life had been attacked by vampires,\r\noutcasts of various kinds, as well as certain animals, werewolves, dead\r\nlizards, and others.\r\n\r\nThe vampire superstition was general in the East and extended to\r\nEurope, it is thought, by way of Greece. The Greeks thought of the\r\nvampire as a beautiful young woman, a lamia, who lured young men to\r\ntheir death. The belief was particularly strong in central Europe, but\r\nnever seemed to gain the same foothold in England that it did on the\r\ncontinent, though it is evident here and has influenced literature. The\r\nvampire has been the inspiration for several operas, and has figured\r\nin the drama, in poetry, in the novel and short story, as well as in\r\nfolk-tales and medieval legends. The stories show the various aspects\r\nof the belief and its ancient hold on the popular mind. The vampire,\r\nas well as the ghost, the devil, and the witch, has appeared on the\r\nEnglish stage. _The Vampire_, an anonymous melodrama in two acts, _The\r\nVampire_, a tragedy by St. John Dorset (1821), _The Vampire Bride_, a\r\nplay, _Le Vampire_, by Alexander Dumas _père_, and _The Vampire, or the\r\nBride of the Isles_, by J. R. Planche, were presented in the London\r\ntheater. The latter which was published in 1820 is remarkably similar\r\nto _The Vampyre_, a novelette by Polidori, published in 1819,--the\r\nstory written after the famous ghost session where Byron, the Shelleys,\r\nand Polidori agreed each to write a ghostly story, Mary Shelley writing\r\n_Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\nPolidori's story, like the play referred to, has for its principal\r\ncharacter an Englishman, Lord Ruthven, the Earl of Marsden, who is the\r\nvampire. In each case there is a supposed death, where the dying man\r\nasks that his body be placed where the last rays of the moon can fall\r\nupon it. The corpse then mysteriously vanishes. In each story there is\r\na complication of a rash pledge of silence made by a man that discovers\r\nthe diabolical nature of the earl, who, having risen from the dead,\r\nis ravaging society as a vampire. In each case a peculiar turn of the\r\nstory is that the masculine vampire requires for his subsistence the\r\nblood of young women, to whom he must be married. He demands a new\r\nvictim, hence a hurried wedding is planned. In the play the ceremony\r\nis interrupted by the bride's father, but in the novelette the plot\r\nis finished and the girl becomes the victim of the destroyer. It is\r\na question which of these productions was written first, and which\r\nimitated the other, or if they had a common source. The author of the\r\ndrama admits getting his material from a French play, but where did\r\nPolidori get his?\r\n\r\nByron seems to have been fascinated with the vampire theme, for in\r\naddition to his unsuccessful short story, he has used the theme in his\r\npoem, _The Giaour_. Here he brings in the idea that the vampire curse\r\nis a judgment from God for sin, and that the most terrible part of the\r\npunishment is the being forced to prey upon those who in life were\r\ndearest to him, which idea occurs in various stories.\r\n\r\n   \"But first on earth as Vampyre sent\r\n    Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\r\n    Then ghastly haunt thy native place\r\n    And suck the blood of all thy race;\r\n    There from thy _daughter_, _sister_, _wife_,\r\n    At midnight drain the stream of life;\r\n    Yet loathe the banquet which perforce\r\n    Must feed thy livid, living corse.\r\n    Thy victims, ere they yet expire\r\n    Shall know the demon for their sire;\r\n    As, cursing thee, thou cursing them,\r\n    Thy flowers are withered on the stem.\r\n    But one, that for thy crime must fall,\r\n    The youngest, best-beloved of all,\r\n    Shall bless thee with a _father's_ name--\r\n    That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\r\n    Yet must thou end the task and mark\r\n    Her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark,\r\n    And the last glassy glance must view\r\n    Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\r\n    Then with unhallowed hand shall tear\r\n    The tresses of her yellow hair,\r\n    Of which, in life, a lock when shorn\r\n    Affection's fondest pledge was worn,--\r\n    But now is borne away by thee\r\n    Memorial of thine agony!\r\n    Yet with thine own best blood shall drip\r\n    Thy gnashing teeth and haggard lip;\r\n    Then stalking to thy sullen grave\r\n    Go--and with ghouls and Afrits rave,\r\n    Till these in horror shrink away\r\n    From specter more accursed than they!\"\r\n\r\nSouthey in his _Thalaba_ shows us a vampire, a young girl in this case,\r\nwho has been torn away from her husband on their wedding day. The curse\r\nimpels her to attack him, to seek to drain his lifeblood. He becomes\r\naware of the truth and takes her father with him to the tomb, to await\r\nher coming forth at midnight, which is the striking hour for vampires.\r\nWhen she appears, \"in her eyes a brightness more terrible than all the\r\nloathsomeness of death,\" her father has the courage to strike a lance\r\nthrough her heart to dispel the demon and let her soul be at peace.\r\n\r\n   \"Then howling with the wound\r\n    The fiendish tenant fled....\r\n    And garmented with glory in their sight\r\n    Oneiza's spirit stood.\"\r\n\r\nKeats uses the Greek idea of the vampire as a lamia or beautiful young\r\nwoman luring young men to death,--the same theme employed by Goethe in\r\nhis _Die Braut von Corinth_. In _Lamia_, when the evil spirit in the\r\nform of a lovely, alluring woman, is accused by the old philosopher,\r\nshe gives a terrible scream and vanishes. This vanishing business is a\r\nfavorite trick with vampires--they leave suddenly when circumstances\r\ncrowd them.\r\n\r\nF. Marion Crawford, in _For the Blood Is the Life_, has given us a\r\nterrible vampire story, in which the dream element is present to a\r\nmarked degree. The young man, who has been vainly loved by a young\r\ngirl, is after her death vampirized by her, something after the fashion\r\nof Turgeniev's Clara Militch, and when his friends get an inkling of\r\nthe truth, and go to rescue him, they find him on her grave, a thin red\r\nline of blood trickling from his throat.\r\n\r\n  And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face\r\n  that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw\r\n  in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon\r\n  gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop.\r\n\r\nThe hawthorne stake is driven through her heart and the vampire expires\r\nafter a terrific struggle, uttering diabolic, human shrieks. There is\r\na certain similarity between this and Gautier's _La Morte Amoreuse_,\r\nwhere the truth is concealed till the last of the story and only\r\nthe initiated would perhaps know that the reincarnated woman was a\r\nvampire. It is also a bit like Turgeniev's _Phantoms_, where a subtle\r\nsuggestion at the last gives the reader the clue to vampirism, though\r\nthe author really asks the question at the close, Was she a vampire?\r\nThe character of the woman is problematic here, as in Gautier's story,\r\nless pronounced than in Crawford's.\r\n\r\nThe idea of occult vampirism used by Turgeniev is also employed by\r\nReginald Hodder in his work, _The Vampire_. Here peculiar power is\r\npossessed by a woman leader of an occult band, who vampirizes by\r\nmeans of a talisman. Her ravages are psychic rather than physical.\r\nTheosophists, according to the _Occult Magazine_, believe in vampires\r\neven in the present. According to their theory, one who has been very\r\nwicked in life is in death so inextricably entangled with his evil\r\nmotives and acts that he is hopelessly lost and knows it, yet seeks to\r\ndelay for a time his final damnation. He can ward off spiritual death\r\nso long as he can keep alive by means of blood his physical corpse. The\r\n_Occult Review_ believes that probably only those acquainted with black\r\nmagic in their lifetime can become vampires,--a thought comforting to\r\nsome of us.\r\n\r\nIt is in Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ that one finds the tensest, most\r\ndreadful modern story of vampirism. This novel seems to omit no detail\r\nof terror, for every aspect of vampire horror is touched upon with\r\nbrutal and ghastly effect. The combination of ghouls, vampires, ghosts,\r\nwerewolves, and other awful elements is almost unendurable, yet the\r\nbook loses in effect toward the last, for the mind cannot endure four\r\nhundred pages of vampiric outrage and respond to fresh impressions\r\nof horror. The initial vampire here is a Hungarian count, who, after\r\nterrorizing his own country for years, transports himself to England\r\nto start his ravages there. Each victim in turn becomes a vampire. The\r\ncombination of modern science with medieval superstition to fight the\r\nscourge, using garlic and sprigs of the wild rose together with blood\r\ntransfusion, is interesting. All the resources of modern science are\r\npitted against the infection and the complications are dramatically\r\nthrilling. The book is not advised as suitable reading for one sitting\r\nalone at night.\r\n\r\nThere are other types of vampirism in addition to the conventional\r\ntheme and the occult vampirism. H. G. Wells gives his customary twist\r\nof novelty to supernaturalism by the introduction of a botanical\r\nvampire in his _The Flowering of the Strange Orchid_. An orchid\r\ncollector is found unaccountably dead in a jungle in the Andaman\r\nIslands, with a strange bulb lying under him, which bulb is brought\r\nto England and watched carefully by a botanist there till it comes to\r\nflower. When at last its blossoms burst open, great tentacles reach out\r\nto grasp the man, sucking his blood and strangling him. The tentacles\r\ndripping blood have to be torn away and the man snatched violently from\r\nthe plant just in time to save his life.\r\n\r\nAlgernon Blackwood, who has touched upon every terrible aspect of\r\nsupernaturalism, gives us two types of vampires in his story, _The\r\nTransfer_. The one is a psychic vampire, stealing the vital power from\r\nothers, a human sponge, absorbing the strength, the ideas, the soul, of\r\nothers. The governess describes him: \"I watched his hard, bleak face;\r\nI noticed how thin he was, and the curious, oily brightness of his\r\nsteady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare\r\nto call the _suction_ of his presence.\" This human vampire comes in\r\ncontact with one of another sort, a soil vampire, the Forbidden Corner,\r\na bald, sore place in the rose garden, like a dangerous bog. The woman\r\nand a little child know the truth of this spot so barren in the midst\r\nof luxurious growth, so sinister in its look and implication. The child\r\nsays of it, \"It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the\r\nfood it wants. But I know what would make it feel right.\" The earth\r\nvampire stretches out silent feelers from its secret strength when the\r\nman comes near the evil spot; the empty, yawning spot gives out audible\r\ncries, then laughs hideously as the man falls forward into the middle\r\nof the patch. \"His eyes, as he dropped, faded shockingly, and across\r\nthe countenance was written plainly what I can only call an expression\r\nof destruction.\" The man lives on physically, yet without vitality,\r\nwithout real life. But it was otherwise with the Forbidden Corner, for\r\nsoon \"it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and\r\ncreepers, very strong, full-fed and bursting thick with life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the vampire stories vary in theme and in treatment. Indian\r\nfolk-tales appearing in English show that the Jigar-Khor, or\r\nLiver-eater of India is a cousin to the vampire, for he can steal your\r\nliver by just looking at you. (It has long been known that hearts can\r\nbe filched in this way, but the liver wrinkle is a new one.) There are\r\nseveral points to be noted in connection with these stories of the\r\nUn-dead, the incorruptible corpses, the loathsome spirits that haunt\r\nthe living. Many of the stories have a setting in the countries where\r\nthe vampire superstition has been most common, though there are English\r\nsettings as well. Continental countries are richer in vampire lore than\r\nEngland, which explains the location of the incidents even in many\r\nEnglish stories and poems. Another point to be noted is the agreement\r\nof the stories in the essential features. While there are numerous\r\nvariants, of course, there is less divergence than in the case of\r\nghosts, for instance. The description of the dæmonic spirit tenanting\r\nthe body of a dead person, driving him by a dreadful urge to attack the\r\nliving, especially those dear to him in life, is much the same. The\r\npersonality of the vampire may vary, in one line of stories being a\r\nyoung woman who lures men to death, in the other a man who must quench\r\nhis thirst with the blood of brides. These are the usual types, though\r\nthere are other variants.\r\n\r\n=The Werewolf and Others.= Another dæmonic figure popular in fiction\r\nis the werewolf. The idea is a very old one, having been mentioned\r\nby various classical writers, it is said, including Pomponius Mela,\r\nHerodotus, and Ovid. The legend of the werewolf is found in practically\r\nall European countries, especially those where the wolf is common. In\r\nFrance many stories of the loup-garou are current. The werewolf is a\r\nhuman being cursed with the power or the obligation to be transformed\r\ninto an animal who goes forth to slay and devour. Like a vampire, he\r\nmight become such as a curse from God, or he might be an innocent\r\nvictim, or might suffer from an atavistic tendency, a cannibalistic\r\ncraving for blood. Distinction is to be made between the real werewolf\r\nand the lycanthrope,--the latter a human being who, on account of\r\nsome peculiar twist of insanity, fancies himself a wolf and acts\r\naccordingly. There is such a character in _The Duchess of Malfi_, a\r\nmaniac who thinks himself a mad wolf, and another in _The Albigenses_,\r\na creature that crouches in a corner of its lair, gnawing at a skull\r\nsnatched from the graveyard, uttering bestial growls. Algernon\r\nBlackwood has a curdling story of lycanthropy, where the insane man\r\nwill eat nothing but raw meat and devours everything living that he\r\ncan get hold of. He confesses to a visitor that he used to bite his old\r\nservant, but that he gave it up, since the old Jew tasted bitter. The\r\nservant also is mad, and \"hides in a vacuum\" when his master goes on a\r\nrampage. Stories of lycanthropy illustrate an interesting aspect of the\r\nassociation between insanity and the supernatural in fiction.\r\n\r\nThe most revolting story of lycanthropy is in Frank Norris's posthumous\r\nnovel, _Vandover and the Brute_. This is a study in soul degeneration,\r\nakin to the moral decay that George Eliot has shown in the character of\r\nTito Melema, but grosser and utterly lacking in artistic restraint. We\r\nsee a young man, at first sensitive, delicate, and with high ideals,\r\ngradually through love of ease and self-indulgence, through taking\r\nalways the line of least resistance, becoming a moral outcast. The\r\nbrute that ever strains at the leash in man gains the mastery and the\r\nartist soul ends in a bestial creature. Dissipation brings on madness,\r\ncalled by the doctors \"lycanthropy-mathesis.\" In his paroxysms of\r\ninsanity the wretch thinks that his body is turned into the beast that\r\nhis soul symbolizes, and runs about his room, naked, four-footed,\r\ngrowling like a jungle animal and uttering harsh, raucous cries of\r\n_Wolf-wolf!_\r\n\r\nKipling's _The Mark of the Beast_ is midway between a lycanthrope and\r\na werewolf story, for while the soul of the beast--or whatever passes\r\nfor the brutish soul--enters into the man and drives out his spirit,\r\nand while many bestial characteristics result, including the revolting\r\nodor, the man does not change his human form.\r\n\r\nWhile lycanthropy has never been a frequent theme in fiction, the\r\nwerewolf is a common figure, appearing in various forms of literature,\r\nfrom medieval ballads and legends to modern short stories. Marie de\r\nFrance, the Anglo-Norman writer,[153] tells of a werewolf that is\r\nby day a gallant knight and kindly gentleman, yet goes on nocturnal\r\nmarauding expeditions. When his wife shows curiosity concerning his\r\nabsences and presses him for an explanation, he reluctantly tells her\r\nthat he is a werewolf, hiding his clothes in a hollow tree, and that\r\nif they were removed he would have to remain a wolf. She has her lover\r\nsteal his clothes, then marries the lover. One day long afterward the\r\nking's attention is called to a wolf that runs up to him and acts\r\nstrangely. It is a tame and well-mannered beast till the false knight\r\nand his wife appear, when he tries to tear their throats. Investigation\r\nreveals the truth, the clothes are fetched, and the curse removed.\r\nArthur O'Shaughnessy's modern version of this, as of others of Marie's\r\n_lais_, is charming.\r\n\r\n      [153] In her lay of _Bisclavret_.\r\n\r\nLike the vampire, the werewolf is under a curse that impels him to prey\r\nupon those dearest to him. Controlled by a dæmonic spirit, the human\r\nbeing, that in his normal personality is kindly and gentle, becomes a\r\njungle beast with ravening instincts. The motif is obviously tangled\r\nup with the vampire superstition here, and it would be interesting,\r\nif possible, to trace out the two to a point of combination. This\r\nirresistible impulse to slay his dear ones introduces a dramatic\r\nelement into the plot, here as in the vampire stories. The wolf is not\r\nthe only animal around whom such plots center, but being most common\r\nhe has given his name to the type. _The Albigenses_ tell of a young\r\nhusband who, as a werewolf, slays his bride, then vanishes to be seen\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nThere are interesting variants of the werewolf story, introducing other\r\nelements of supernaturalism. In _A Vendetta of the Jungle_,[154] we\r\nhave the idea of successive infection of the moral curse, similar to\r\nthe continuation of vampirism. Mrs. Crump, a lady in India, is eaten\r\nby a tiger, who has a good digestion for he assimilates not only her\r\nbody but her soul. So that now it is Mrs. Crump-Tiger, we might say,\r\nthat goes about the jungle eating persons. In time she devours her\r\nsuccessor in her husband's affection. The man is aware that it is his\r\nfirst wife who has eaten his second, so he starts out to kill the\r\nanimal to clear off the score. But by the time he reaches the jungle\r\nthe beast has had time to digest his meal and when the husband levels\r\nhis gun to fire, the eyes that look out at him from the brutish face\r\nare his beloved's eyes. What could he do?\r\n\r\n      [154] By Arthur Applier and H. Sidney Warwick.\r\n\r\nEugene Field gives a new turn to the idea by representing the werewolf\r\ncurse as a definite atavistic throw-back. His wolf-man is an innocent\r\nmarauder, the reincarnation of a wicked grandfather, yet a gentle,\r\nchivalrous soul very different from his grandparent. The old gentleman\r\nhas left him heir to nothing but the curse and a magic spear given\r\nhim by the witch Brunhilde. The werewolf bears a charmed life against\r\nwhich no weapon of man can avail, and the country is panic-stricken\r\nover his ravages. The legend is that the beast's fury cannot be stopped\r\ntill some man offers himself as a voluntary sacrifice to the wolf. The\r\nyouth does not know that he is the guilty one until his reprehensible\r\ngrandfather appears to him in a vision, demanding his soul. He hears\r\nthat there is to be a meeting in the sacred grove on a certain day\r\nand begs his beloved to remain away, lest the werewolf come. But when\r\nshe insists that she will go, he gives her his magic spear, telling\r\nher to strike the wolf through the heart if he approaches her. True\r\nto his accursed destiny the wolf does come to the grove and lunges at\r\nthe girl. All the men flee but one, and his weapons fail,--then the\r\nterrified girl hurls the spear, striking the beast to the heart. But\r\nwhen he falls, it is young Harold who is dying, who has given himself\r\na voluntary sacrifice to save others. The curse is lifted but he is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nIn _The Camp of the Dog_, by Algernon Blackwood, we have another\r\nunconscious werewolf, a gentle, modest, manly young fellow madly\r\nin love with a girl who doesn't care for him. In his sleep he goes\r\nquesting for her. While his body lies shrunken on a cot in his tent,\r\nhis soul takes the form of a wolf and goes to the hilltop, uttering\r\nunearthly howls. By an equally strong psychic disturbance the girl is\r\nimpelled to go in a somnambulistic state to the hilltop. Each is in\r\nwaking hours utterly unaware of their strange jaunts, till the father\r\nshoots the wolf. The young man in this case suffers only curious\r\npsychic wounds, from which he recovers when the girl promises to marry\r\nhim, and the wolf is seen no more.\r\n\r\nThe panther plays his part in this were-menagerie. Ambrose Bierce, in\r\n_The Eyes of the Panther_, tells of a young girl who, because of a\r\nprenatal curse similar to that affecting Elsie Venner, is not wholly\r\nhuman. She is conscious of her dual nature and tells the man she loves\r\nthat she cannot marry him since she is a panther by night. He thinks\r\nher mildly insane till one night a settler sees a beast's eyes glaring\r\ninto his window and fires. When they follow the blood-tracks, they find\r\nthe girl dying. This is one of the conventions of the werewolf story,\r\nthe wounding of an animal that escapes and the blood-trail that leads\r\nto a human being wounded just as the beast was.\r\n\r\nElliott O'Donnell, in a volume called _Werewolves_ published in London\r\nin 1912, gives serious credence to the existence of werewolves not only\r\nin the past but also in the present. He tells a number of stories of\r\nwhat he claims are authenticated instances of such beings in actual\r\nlife. He relates the experience of a man who told him that he had\r\nhimself seen a youth turn himself into a tiger after preparatory\r\npasses of enchantment. The watcher made haste to climb a sacred Vishnu\r\ntree when the transformation was complete. O'Donnell tells a tale of a\r\nwidow with three children that married a Russian nobleman. She saw him\r\nand his servant change into werewolves, at least partially, remaining\r\nin a half state, devouring her children whom she left behind in her\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nO'Donnell relates several stories of authentic (according to him)\r\nwerewolf stories of England in recent times, giving the dates and\r\nplaces and names of the persons who saw the beasts. The incidents may\r\nbe similar to those spoken of in Dickens's _Haunted House_, where\r\nthe famous \"'ooded woman with the howl\" was seen,--or at least, many\r\npersons saw the owl and knew that the woman must be near by. These\r\nwitnesses of werewolves may have seen animals, all right enough.\r\nModernity is combined with medieval superstition here, and it seems\r\nuncanny, for instance, to identify a werewolf by means of an electric\r\npocket flashlight.\r\n\r\nIn collections of folk-tales, the tribal legends of the American\r\nredmen as well as of Kipling's India and of England, there are various\r\nstories of werewolves. Among primitive peoples there is a close\r\nrelation between the brute and the human and the attributing of human\r\ncharacteristics and powers to the beast and _vice versa_ is common, so\r\nthat this supernatural transfer of personality is natural enough. A\r\nmadwolf might suggest the idea for a werewolf.\r\n\r\nAlgernon Blackwood advances the theory that the werewolf is a true\r\npsychical fact of profound importance, however it may have been garbled\r\nby superstition. He thinks that the werewolf is the projection of the\r\nuntamed slumbering sanguinary instincts of man, \"scouring the world\r\nin his fluidic body, the body of desire.\" As the mind wanders free\r\nfrom the conscious control of the will in sleep, so the body may free\r\nitself from the fetters of mind or of custom and go forth in elemental\r\nform to satisfy its craving to slay, to slake its wild thirst for\r\nblood. O'Donnell says that werewolves may be phantasms of the dead that\r\ncannot be at peace, or a certain kind of Elementals. He also thinks\r\nthat they may be the projection of one phase of man's nature, of the\r\ncruelty latent in mankind that seeks expression in this way. According\r\nto that theory, a chap might have a whole menagerie inside him, to\r\nturn loose at intervals, which would be exciting but rather risky\r\nfor society. It was doubtless a nature such as this that Maupassant\r\nattempts to describe in his story _The Wolf_, where the man has all the\r\ninstincts of the wolf yet never changes his human form.\r\n\r\nThe werewolf in fiction has suffered the same leveling influence\r\nthat we have observed in the case of the ghost, the devil, the\r\nwitch, and the vampire. He is becoming a more psychical creature, a\r\nromantic figure to be sympathized with, rather than a beast to be\r\nutterly condemned. In recent fiction the werewolf is represented\r\nas an involuntary and even unconscious departure from the human,\r\nwho is shocked when he learns the truth about himself. Whether he\r\nbe the victim of a divine curse, an agent of atavistic tendencies,\r\nor a being who thus gives vent to his real and brutish instincts,\r\nwe feel a sympathy with him. We analyze his motives--at a safe\r\ndistance--seek to understand his vagaries and to estimate his kinship\r\nwith us. We think of him now as a noble figure in fiction, a lupine\r\nGalahad like Blackwood's, a renunciatory hero like Eugene Field's\r\nor what not. Or we reflect that he may be a case of metempsychosis\r\nand treat him courteously, for who knows what we may be ourselves\r\nsome day? The werewolf has not figured in poetry or in the drama as\r\nhave other supernatural beings, as the ghost, the devil, the witch,\r\nthe vampire,--one wonders why. He is a dramatic figure and his\r\ncharacter-analysis might well furnish themes for poetry though stage\r\npresentation would have its difficulties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the revival of interest in Elizabethan literature has had a\r\ngood deal to do with the use of supernatural beings in literature\r\nof recent times. The devil and the dæmonic spirits he controls, the\r\nwitches and wizards, the vampires, the enchanted animals, to whom he\r\ndelegates a part of his infernal power, appear as impressive moral\r\nallegories, mystical stories of life, symbols of truths. As literature\r\nis a reflection of life, the evil as well as the good enters in. But\r\nsince the things of the spirit are intangible they must be represented\r\nin concrete form, as definite beings whom our minds can apprehend. Thus\r\nthe poets and dramatists and story-makers must show us images to shadow\r\nforth spiritual things. As with a shudder we close the books that tell\r\nus horrifying tales of satanic spirits, of accursed beings that are\r\nneither wholly animal nor human, of mortals with diabolic powers, we\r\nshrink from the evils of the soul that they represent, and recognize\r\ntheir essential truth in the guise of fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSupernatural Life\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fiction dealing with immortal life shows, more than any other\r\naspect of the subject, humanity's deep hunger for the supernatural.\r\nWhether it be stories of continuance of earthly existence without death\r\nas in the legends of the undying persons like the Wandering Jew; or of\r\nsupernaturally renewed or preserved youth as described in the tales of\r\nthe elixir of life; or of the transference of the soul after death into\r\nanother body; or of life continued in the spirit in other worlds than\r\nthis after the body's death,--all show our craving for something above\r\nand beyond what we know here and now. Conscious of our own helplessness\r\nwe long to feel ourselves leagued with immortal powers; shrinking\r\naffrighted from the grave's near brink we yearn for that which would\r\nspare us death's sting and victory. Sadly knowing with what swift,\r\nrelentless pace old age is overtaking us we would fain find something\r\nto give us eternal youth. But since we cannot have these gifts in our\r\nown persons we seek them vicariously in fiction, and for a few hours'\r\nleisured forgetfulness we are endowed with immortal youth and joy. Or,\r\nlooking past death, we can feel ourselves more than conquerors in a\r\nlife beyond.\r\n\r\n   \"Oh world unknowable, we touch thee!\r\n    Inapprehensible, we clutch thee!\"\r\n\r\nWe somehow snatch a strange comfort from these stories of a life beyond\r\nour own. We are comforted for our mortality when we see the tragedy\r\nthat dogs the steps of those who may not die, whether Swift's loathsome\r\nStruldbrugs or the Wandering Jew. Our own ignorance of the future\r\nmakes us credulous of any man's dream of heaven and at the same time\r\nsceptical of anybody else's hell. We are such indestructible optimists\r\nthat we can take any sort of raw material of fiction and transmute it\r\ninto stuff that hope is made of.\r\n\r\n=The Wandering Jew.= There is no legend more impressive than that of\r\nthe Wandering Jew, and none save the Faust theme that has so influenced\r\nliterature. The story is as deathless as the person it portrays and\r\nhas wandered into as many lands, though it is impossible to trace with\r\ncertainty its origin or first migrations. There is an Arabian legend of\r\none Samiri who forever wanders, crying, \"Touch me not!\" as there is a\r\nBuddhist account of a man cursed for working miracles for show, to whom\r\nBuddha said, \"Thou shalt not attain Nirvana while my religion lasts.\"\r\nThere are similar Chinese and Indian versions and the idea occurs in\r\nEnglish folk-tales, where the plovers are thought to be the souls of\r\nthose that crucified Christ, condemned to fly forever over the world,\r\nuttering their plaintive cry.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the Wandering Jew in English literature is in\r\nthe Chronicles of Roger of Wendover, who reports the legend as being\r\ntold at the monastery of St. Albans by an Armenian bishop, in 1228, but\r\nto hearers already familiar with it. There are two distinct versions\r\nof the story appearing in English literature. One relates that the\r\nwanderer is a certain Cartapholus, a servant in Pilate's palace, who\r\nstruck Jesus a brutal blow as He was led forth to death, and to whom He\r\nsaid, \"Thou shalt wander till I come!\" The other is of German origin\r\ngiving the personality of Ahasuerus, a shoemaker of Jerusalem, who\r\nmocked the Savior as He passed to Golgotha. Bowed under the weight of\r\nthe cross, Christ leaned for a moment's rest against the door of the\r\nlittle shop, but Ahasuerus said scornfully, \"Go faster, Jew!\" With one\r\nlook of deep reproach, Christ answered, \"I go, but tarry thou till I\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew story is cosmopolitan, used in the literature of many\r\nlands. In Germany it has engaged the attention of Berthold Auerbach,\r\nKingemann, Schlegel, Julius Mosen, and Chamisso, in France that of\r\nEdgar Quinet and Eugene Sue. Hans Christian Andersen has used it while\r\nHeijermans has written a Dutch play on it and Carmen Sylva, late Queen\r\nof Roumania, made it the basis for a long dramatic poem.\r\n\r\nThe theme has appeared in various forms in English literature, besides\r\nin fiction where it has been most prominent. A comedy[155] was\r\npublished in 1797, by Andrew Franklin, though the wanderer is here\r\nused only as a hoax. Wordsworth has a poem entitled The _Song of the\r\nWandering Jew_, and Shelley was fascinated by the legend, as we see\r\nfrom the fact that he used it three times. One of his first poems, a\r\nlong dramatic attempt, written at eighteen, is _The Wandering Jew_,\r\na fevered poem showing the same weaknesses that his Gothic romances\r\nreveal, yet with a hint of his later power. The Wandering Jew appears\r\nas a definite character in both _Queen Mab_ and _Hellas_, in the first\r\nAhasuerus being summoned to testify concerning God, while he appears in\r\nthe latter to give supernatural vision of events. In both poems he is\r\nvery old, for in the first it is said:\r\n\r\n      [155] _The Wandering Jew_, or _Love's Masquerade_.\r\n\r\n\"His port and mien bore marks of many years....\r\n\r\n\"Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth,\" while in the latter he is\r\ndescribed as being \"so old he seems to have outlived a world's decay.\"\r\nShelley follows the German version, as used in a fragment he picked up\r\ntorn and soiled in Lincoln's Inn Fields, whose author he did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. Eubule-Evans, in a long dramatic poem of considerable power,[156]\r\ntells the story of Theudas, who could be released from his doom of\r\nimmortality if only he would repent, but he will not. He renews his\r\nyouth every forty years, growing suddenly from a decrepit man to a\r\nhandsome, gifted youth, which naturally suggests complications of human\r\nlove-affairs. Other elements of supernaturalism are used, as angels,\r\ndemons, and so forth while the Æons and the Intermedii (whoever they\r\nare!) appear as chorus.\r\n\r\n      [156] _The Curse of the Wandering Jew._\r\n\r\n_The Wandering Jew, a Christmas Carol_,[157] retells the story with\r\nvariations and with some power. The Jew here is shown to be very old\r\nand feeble, clad in antique raiment, with stigmata of the wounds on\r\nhands and feet. He is symbolic of the Christ, of His failure to win men.\r\n\r\n   \"For lo, at last I knew\r\n    The lineaments of that diviner Jew,\r\n    That like a Phantom passeth everywhere,\r\n    The world's last hope and bitterest despair,\r\n    Deathless, yet dead!\r\n    And lo! while all men come and pass away\r\n    That phantom of the Christ, forlorn and gray,\r\n    Haunteth the earth, with desolate footfall.\"\r\n\r\n      [157] By Robert Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew is seen definitely once in Gothic fiction, in Lewis's\r\n_The Monk_, where a mysterious stranger, bearing on his forehead a\r\nburning cross imprinted, appears and is spoken of as the Wandering\r\nJew. He is unable to stay more than fourteen days in any one place but\r\nmust forever hurry on. Rev. T. Clark[158] gives a bird's-eye view of\r\nhistory such as a person of the long life and extensive migrations of\r\nthe wanderer would see it.\r\n\r\n      [158] In _The Wandering Jew_, or the _Travels and Observations\r\n      of Bareach the Prolonged_.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a deathless man appealed strongly to Hawthorne, who plays\r\nwith the theme in various passages in his works and notebooks. In\r\n_A Virtuoso's Collection_, where Peter Rugg, the Missing Man, is\r\ndoor-keeper and where the collection includes a letter from the Flying\r\nDutchman to his wife, together with a flask of the elixir of life, the\r\nvirtuoso himself is none other than the Wandering Jew. He speaks of\r\nhis destiny and says that human prayers will not avail to aid him. The\r\ntouch of his hand is like ice, conveying a sense of spiritual as well\r\nas physical chill. The character appears also as one of the guests in\r\n_A Select Party_, of whom the author remarks: \"This personage, however,\r\nhad latterly grown so common by mingling in all sorts of society and\r\nappearing at the beck of every entertainer that he could hardly be\r\ndeemed a proper guest in an exclusive circle.\" This bit of satire\r\nillustrates how common the theme had become at that time in fiction.\r\n\r\nThere are various threads of narration tangled up with the Wandering\r\nJew motif. He is said by some writers to have supernatural power to\r\nheal disease, while by others he is thought to be the helpless bearer\r\nof evil and death. Eugène Sue in his novel represents him as carrying\r\nthe plague, knowing his awful destiny, yet, while wildly regretting it,\r\npowerless in the clutch of fate. Here he appears as a voluntary agent\r\nof good toward the Rennepont family and an involuntary minister of evil\r\nin other ways. An anonymous story[159] uses the same idea of the plague\r\nassociation but carries it further, for here the wanderer is not a\r\npersonality but the plague itself, passing like a doom over the world,\r\nwhich shows how far that phase of the legend has gone.\r\n\r\n      [159] _In the Track of the Wandering Jew._\r\n\r\nThe legend has been utilized variously to impress religious truths.\r\nCharles Granville[160] writes a symbolic story with a definite\r\nreligious message. The idea of the immortal wanderer is represented as\r\nthe concept of a part of humanity urged by an earnest longing which\r\ndominates their whole life and thought, the desire that a new kingdom\r\nof God might come. The book is a social satire, an appeal for the\r\ncoming of a real democracy, real justice and genuine spirituality.\r\nGeorge Croly[161] has for his purpose the proving that Christ's second\r\ncoming is near at hand. Lew Wallace, who himself uses the theme of\r\nthe Wanderer, thought this book one of the half dozen volumes which\r\ntaken alone would constitute a British literature. We are likely to\r\nfind ourselves questioning Wallace's judgment in the matter, for\r\nwhile the novel is interesting and has a sermon impressed with some\r\ninterest, it is by no means a great piece of literature. Salathiel is\r\npictured as a young, enthusiastic, passionate Jew striving to defend\r\nhis country against the woes that threaten her. His life is given in\r\ndetail immediately following his unpardonable sin, and his definite\r\ncareer ends with the destruction of Jerusalem, though his immortality\r\nis suggested at the close. The book describes many supernatural\r\nhappenings, the miraculous phenomena accompanying the death of Christ\r\nand manifestations following the fate of the city.\r\n\r\n      [160] In _The Plaint of the Wandering Jew_.\r\n\r\n      [161] In _Salathiel the Immortal_, or _Tarry Thou Till I Come_.\r\n\r\nIn Lew Wallace's _The Prince of India_ the deathless man appears\r\nagain. In the beginning of the story he enters a vault from which he\r\nremoves the treasure from mummy cases, remarking that the place has\r\nnot been visited since he was there a thousand years before. He has\r\nnumerous impressive experiences, such as seeing a monk that seems the\r\nreincarnation of Jesus, and hearing again the centurion's call to\r\nhim. Wallace pictures the Jew as old, a philosopher, in contrast to\r\nSalathiel's impetuous youth. He is striving to bring the sons of men\r\ninto closer spiritual truth with each other and with God, as Salathiel\r\ntries to prevent the material destruction of the city. The sense of\r\nresponsibility, the feeling of a mission toward others, expressed in\r\nthis novel, may be compared with that of Eugène Sue's Wandering Jew who\r\nacts as a friend to the Rennepont family, protecting their interests\r\nagainst the wily Jesuits.\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew has been represented in many ways, with stress\r\nplaced on various aspects of his life and character. He has been\r\ndepicted psychologically, as a suffering human being, mythologically to\r\nillustrate the growth and change in life, religiously to preach certain\r\ntenets and beliefs, and symbolically to show forth the soul of man. He\r\nappears symbolically as the creature accursed of God, driven forever\r\nin the face of doom. Shelley and others show him as vainly attempting\r\nsuicide, but living on, anguished yet deathless, in the face of every\r\neffort to take his own life as in the teeth of torture from others. He\r\nstands at once for the undying power of God's plan, and, as in Robert\r\nBuchanan's version, for the typified failure of Christ's mission. He is\r\nused to prove that Christ's second coming is near, and to prove also\r\nthat He will never come. To the Christian he stands for the evidence\r\nof Christ's power of divinity, while to the Jew he is a symbol of that\r\nunhappy race that wanders ever, with no home in any land.\r\n\r\nBesides those mentioned, other English and American writers who have\r\nmade use of the legend are Kipling; Bram Stoker, who discusses him\r\nin his assembly of Famous Impostors; M. D. Conway, who gives various\r\nversions of the story; David Hoffman, Henry Seton Merriman, S.\r\nBaring-Gould, W. H. Ainsworth, and others.\r\n\r\nA legend closely associated with this and yet separate, is that of\r\na woman who bore the curse of eternal wandering. One version brings\r\nin Herodias as the doomed woman, while the character of Kundry in\r\n_Parsifal_ represents another feminine wanderer. William Sharp, in his\r\n_Gypsy Christ_, gives the story differently still, saying that it is\r\nnot correctly told in _Parsifal_. As Sharp tells it, it is a piece of\r\ntragic symbolism. Kundry, a gypsy woman of evil life, mocks Christ on\r\nGolgotha and demands of Him a sign, to whom He says, \"To thee and thine\r\nI bequeath the signs of my Passion to be a shame and horror among thy\r\npeople forevermore!\" Upon her hands and feet appear the stigmata of His\r\nwounds, never to fade away, and to be borne by her descendants in every\r\nthird generation. Various ones of her descendants are crucified, and\r\nwherever the wanderers go on earth they bear the marks of horror. The\r\ncurse would be lifted from them only when a Gypsy Christ should be born\r\nof a virgin; but then the Children of the Wind should be dispersed and\r\nvanish from among men. In the last chapter Naomi prophesies that she is\r\nto give birth to the Gypsy Christ.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the Wandering Jew, while rivalling the Faust legend in\r\nimpressiveness and in the frequence with which it has been used in\r\nliterature, yet is different in having had no adequate representation.\r\nNo truly great poem or drama or novel has been written concerning\r\nthis tragic, deathless character. Perhaps it may come yet. Only\r\nhints of his personality have appeared in very recent fiction,\r\nsuch as the reincarnation in the character of the young Jew in\r\nA. T. Quiller-Couch's story, _The Mystery of Joseph Laquedem_, or the\r\nhumorous reference to him in Brander Matthews's _Primer of Imaginary\r\nGeography_, or _The Holy Cross_ by Eugene Field, where the wanderer is\r\npitied by a Spanish priest in Cortez's train in Mexico. His prayers win\r\nforgiveness and the tortured Jew dies. After his death an earthquake\r\nsupernaturally splits a gulf on each side of the grave and a cross of\r\nsnow appears there, to remain forever. Perhaps the theme is fading out\r\nnow in fiction and drama, to disappear completely, or perhaps it is\r\nlying forgotten for a while, waiting the master hand that shall give it\r\nadequate treatment.\r\n\r\n=Elixir of Life.= Immortality that proves such a curse in the case\r\nof the Wandering Jew forms the basis for various other stories.\r\nThe elixir of life was a favorite theme with the Gothicists, being\r\nused by Maturin, Godwin, and Shelley, and has continued to furnish\r\ncomplication for fiction since that time. The theme has been popular on\r\nthe continent as well as in England, Balzac and Hoffman being the most\r\nimpressive users of it.\r\n\r\nBulwer-Lytton, in _A Strange Story_, introduces the elixir of life\r\ntogether with other forms of supernaturalism, such as mesmerism, magic,\r\nspectral apparitions, invisible manifestations, awful bodiless Eyes, a\r\ngigantic Foot, and so forth. Margrave attempts to concoct the potion\r\nthat shall give him endless life, but after mysterious preparations,\r\nincantations, and supernatural manifestations, at the crucial moment a\r\nstampede of maddened beasts, urged forward by the dreadful Foot, dashes\r\nthe beaker from his lips. The irreplaceable liquid wastes its force on\r\nthe desert sands, where a magic richness of herbage instantly springs\r\nup in contrast to the barrenness around it. Flowers bloom, myriads\r\nof insects hover round them, and all is life, but the man who sought\r\nthe elixir with such pains lies dead. The author suggests a symbolic\r\nmeaning for his story, hinting that the scientist's laboratory holds\r\nmany elixirs of life, that all growth and life are magical, that all\r\nbeing is miraculous.\r\n\r\nRider Haggard, in _She_ and _Ayesha_, its sequel, describes a\r\nwonderful woman who possesses the secret of eternal life and has lived\r\nfor thousands of years, ever young and beautiful, supernaturally\r\nenchanting. Her magic potion not only gives her length of days but\r\nprotection against danger as well, for her rival's dagger glances\r\nharmlessly away from her, and she is proof against chance and fate.\r\nShe gains her immortal life partly by bathing in a secret essence or\r\nvapor whose emanations give her mystic force and immortal beauty.\r\nThere are many other elements of supernaturalism in association with\r\nthe not impossible She,--magic vision, reincarnation, a mystic light\r\nthat envelops her body, the power to call up the dead, to reanimate\r\nthe skeletons in the desert and raise them to dreadful life. She is an\r\ninteresting but fearsome personality.\r\n\r\nIn _Ahrinziman_, by Anita Silvani, we have magic chemistry yielding up\r\nthe elixir of life. Jelul-uh-din has lived for five hundred years and\r\nlooks forward to a still more protracted existence. His magic drug not\r\nonly gives him prolonged life but will do anything he wishes besides,\r\nsince he has hypnotized it. Yet he is found dead. \"On his wrists were\r\nmarks of giant fingers, scorched and burnt into the flesh like marks\r\nof hot iron. And on his throat were marks of a similar hand which had\r\nevidently strangled him.\" It is apparent that his master, the De'il,\r\ngot impatient and cut short the leisurely existence that he felt\r\nbelonged to him.\r\n\r\nHawthorne was greatly interested in the theme of the elixir of life. He\r\ngives us two brews of it in _Septimius Felton_, one an Indian potion\r\nconcocted by an old sachem. The red man gets so old that his tribe\r\nfind him a great nuisance and obstacle to progress so they gravely\r\nrequest permission to kill him. But his skull is so hard that the stone\r\nhammers are smashed when they try to brain him, his skin so tough\r\nthat no arrows will pierce it, and nothing seems to avail. Finally\r\nthey fill his mouth and nostrils with clay and put him in the sun to\r\nbake, till presently his heart bursts with a loud explosion, tearing\r\nhis body to fragments. This brew of his is matched by one made by an\r\nEuropean scientist after long endeavors. Here the ultimate ingredient\r\nis supposed to be a strange herb that grows from a mysterious grave.\r\nAt last, just when the youth thinks he has the right combination, the\r\nwoman who has lured him on to destruction dashes the cup from his lips,\r\nsaving him from the poison he would have drunk. The flower has grown\r\nfrom the grave of her lover, whom the young scientist has murdered.\r\n\r\nIn _The Dolliver Romance_, that pathetic fragment Hawthorne left\r\nunfinished at his death, we find another treatment of the theme. It\r\nseems symbolic that in his old age and failing powers, he should\r\nhave been thinking of immortal youth, of deathless life. In this\r\nstory various magical elements are introduced. The herbs grown in old\r\nGrandsir Dolliver's garden have a strange power, for when a woman lays\r\na flower from one on her breast, it glows like a gem and lends a bloom\r\nof youth to her cheeks. The old man seeks the one unknown essence, the\r\nincalculable element necessary to make up the elixir of life, as did\r\nthe youth in _Septimius Felton_. He drinks occasional mouthfuls of a\r\nstrange cordial that he finds in an old bottle on the shelf, and seems\r\nto grow younger and stronger. He, too, like Septimius, has a visitor;\r\na man that demands the cordial as belonging to him by ancestral right,\r\nsnatches it from the aged hands, drinks it down at a draught and grows\r\nviolently young, but dies in convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn _Dr. Heidigger's Experiment_ Hawthorne gives us another sad symbolic\r\nstory of the quest of the elixir of youth. The old physician invites\r\nfour aged friends to make an experiment, to drink of a cordial which\r\nshall restore youth, but which he himself is too wise to share. The\r\nstrange potion proves its power by restoring to beauty and perfume a\r\nrose that has been dead for over fifty years. When the old persons\r\ndrink they become young and happy and beautiful once more. Age drops\r\nfrom them like a mantle discarded and the world glows again with\r\npassion and color and joy. But alas! it is only ephemeral, for the\r\neffects soon pass away and senility is doubly tragic after one snatched\r\nhour of joy and youth. There is a sad philosophy of life expressed in\r\nthese symbolic allegories such as Hawthorne alone knows how to tell.\r\n\r\nElsewhere Hawthorne shows his deep interest in the theme. In _The\r\nBirthmark_ the scientist intimates that he could brew the life elixir\r\nif he would, but that it would produce a discord in nature such as\r\nall the world, and chiefly he that drank it, would curse at last.\r\nThe subject is referred to in other places,[162] and a flask of the\r\nprecious, dreadful elixir is one of the treasures in the Virtuoso's\r\ncollection. In a note concerning his use of the theme in _The Dolliver\r\nRomance_ Hawthorne states that he has been accused of plagiarizing from\r\nDumas, but that in reality Dumas plagiarized from him, since his book\r\nwas many years the earlier.\r\n\r\n      [162] In _Dr. Bullivant_.\r\n\r\nH. G. Wells[163] uses this theme combined with the transfer of\r\npersonality. An aged man bargains with a youth to make him his heir on\r\ncertain conditions. The purpose, unknown to the young fellow, is to\r\nrob him of his youth to reanimate the old man. A magic drink transfers\r\nthe personality of the octogenarian to the body of youth and leaves\r\nthe young man's soul cabined in the worn-out frame. But the drug is\r\nmore powerful than Mr. Elvesham supposed, for it brings death to both\r\nwho drink it and the bargain has a ghastly climax. Barry Pain has a\r\nsomewhat similar situation of the tragic miscalculation, in _The Wrong\r\nElixir_, the story of an alchemist who brews the life-giving potion but\r\nmeans to keep it all to himself. On a certain night he will drink it\r\nand become immortally young, in a world of dying men. While he waits,\r\na gypsy girl asks him to give her a poison to kill a man she hates.\r\nHe prepares the potion for her and sets it aside. He drinks at the\r\ntime he planned, but instead of eternal life, the draught brings him\r\nswift-footed death. Does he drink the wrong elixir, or have all his\r\ncalculations been wrong?\r\n\r\n      [163] In _The Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham_.\r\n\r\nAn example of the way in which the magic of the old fiction of\r\nsupernaturalism has been transferred into the scientific in modern\r\ntimes, is seen in _The Elixir of Youth_, by Albert Bigelow Paine. A\r\nman in an upper room alone is wishing that he had the gift of immortal\r\nyouth, when a stranger in black enters and answers his thought. He\r\ntells him that to read the mind is not black magic, but science; that\r\nhe is not a magician, but a scientist, and as such he has compounded\r\nthe elixir of youth, which he will give to him. This drug will enable\r\na man to halt his age at any year he chooses and to make it permanent,\r\nas Peter Ibbetson and the Duchess of Towers did in their dream-life.\r\nThe stranger leaves the flask with the man and goes away. But the one\r\nwho wished for immortal life decides that after all God must know best,\r\nand, though his decision not to drink has not crystalized, he is not\r\ngreatly sorry when the flask is shattered and the liquid spilled. This\r\nis symbolic of the real wisdom of life.\r\n\r\nThe frequent use of the theme of the elixir of life, of deathless\r\nyouth, illustrates how humanity clutches at youth with pathos and\r\nshrinks from age. Red Ranrahan, the loved singer of Ireland, whom W. B.\r\nYeats creates for us with unforgettable words, makes a curse against\r\nold age when he feels it creeping on him.\r\n\r\nVarious other stories of supernatural length of years appear in English\r\nfiction, besides those based on the definite use of the life elixir.\r\n_The Woman from Yonder_, by Stephen French Whitman, shows us the\r\nrevived, reanimated body of a woman who has been buried in a glacier\r\nsince Hannibal crossed the Alps, till she is dug out and miraculously\r\nrestored, by blood-transfusion, by an interfering scientist. The\r\nwriter queries, \"If the soul exists, where had that soul been? What\r\nregions did it relinquish at the command of the reviving body?\" A\r\nhumorous application of the idea of the deathless man is seen in A.\r\nConan Doyle's _The Los Amigos Fiasco_, where the citizens of a frontier\r\ntown, wishing to kill a criminal by some other method than the trite\r\nrope, try to kill him by putting him in connection with a big dynamo.\r\nBut their amateur efforts have a peculiar effect. They succeed only\r\nin so magnetizing his body that it is impossible for him to die. They\r\ntry shooting, hanging, and so forth, but he has gained such an access\r\nof vitality from electricity that he comes out unscathed through\r\neverything, resembling the ancient sachem in Hawthorne's novel.\r\n\r\nThe Flying Dutchman forms the theme for stories in folklore, of a\r\nwanderer of the seas condemned to touch shore only once in seven years,\r\nbecause he swore he would round Cape Horn in spite of heaven and hell.\r\nHawthorne has preserved a letter from the Dutchman to his wife, in\r\nthe Virtuoso's collection, and John Kendrick Bangs has furnished the\r\ninevitable parody in his _Pursuit of the Houseboat_. _The Dead Ship_\r\nof Harpwell is another story of a wandering, accursed ship. There is a\r\nsimilar legend told by C. M. Skinner,[164] of a man, who, for a cruel\r\nmurder of a servant, was condemned to wear always a halter round his\r\nneck and was unable to die.\r\n\r\n      [164] In _Myths and Legends of Our Land_.\r\n\r\nBram Stoker furnishes us with several interesting specimens of\r\nsupernatural life, always tangled with other uncanny motives. The\r\ncount, in _Dracula_, who has lived his vampire life for centuries, is\r\nsaid to be hale and fresh as if he were forty. Of course, all vampires\r\nlive to a strange lease on life, but most of them are spirits rather\r\nthan human beings as was Dracula. In _The Lair of the White Worm_,\r\nStoker tells of a woman who was at once an alluring woman and a snake\r\nthousands of years old. The snake is so large that, when it goes out to\r\nwalk, it looks like a high white tower, and can gaze over the tops of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nBulwer-Lytton's _The Haunters and the Haunted_ tells the story of a\r\nmysterious being who passes through untold years with a strange power\r\nover life and the personality of others. He appears, no man knows\r\nwhence nor why, and disappears as strangely, while about his whole\r\ncareer is a shroud of mystery. Thackeray, in his _Notch on the Axe_,\r\nburlesques this and similar stories in playful satire, yet seems to\r\nenjoy his theme. It is not wholly a burlesque, we may suppose. He\r\nadds a touch of realism to his humorous description by the fact that,\r\nthroughout his hero's long-continued life, or series of lives--one\r\ndoesn't know which--he retains always his German-Jewish accent. Andrew\r\nLang describes[165] the person who may have been the original of these\r\nstories in real life. Horace Walpole has mentioned him in his letters\r\nand he seems to have a teasing mystery about his life and career that\r\nmakes him much talked-of.\r\n\r\n      [165] In _St. Germain the Deathless_.\r\n\r\nEdwin Lester Arnold[166] tells a story of continued life with an\r\nOriental setting and mystery. Edward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_,\r\nby the introduction of a magic sleep makes a man live far beyond the\r\nnatural span and be able to see into the distant future, while the\r\nyouth in Mark Twain's _A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court_ has\r\na magic length of life, living a dual existence, in Arthurian England\r\nand in present-day America. H. G. Wells[167] uses something of the same\r\nidea, in that he makes his hero live a very long time in a few hours,\r\ncompressing time into minute tabules, as it were, as he does in another\r\nstory of the magic accelerator that makes a man live fast and furiously\r\nwith tenfold powers at crucial moments. The story of Peter Rugg, the\r\nMissing Man, is that of another immortal wanderer, whose story is told\r\nin _Myths and Legends of Our Land_, and utilized by Alfred Austin. He\r\ngoes out into a storm, saying, \"I will see home to-night or I will\r\nnever see it!\" He flies forever pursued by the storm, never resting,\r\nand never seeing his home. This is symbolic of the haunted soul pursued\r\nby its own destiny.\r\n\r\n      [166] In _The Strange Adventures of Phra the Phoenician_.\r\n\r\n      [167] In his _Time Machine_.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the elixir of life is one of the old motifs of\r\nsupernaturalism retained in modern fiction. The conventional alchemist\r\nhas given place to a more up-to-date investigator in the chemical\r\nlaboratory, yet the same thrill of interest is imparted by the thought\r\nof a magic potion prepared by man that shall endow him with earthly\r\nimmortality. The theme has changed less in its treatment and symbolism\r\nthan most of the supernatural elements in fiction, for though we see\r\nthe added elements of modern satire and symbolism, its essential\r\naspects remain the same.\r\n\r\n=Metempsychosis.= The idea of metempsychosis, the thought that at\r\ndeath the soul of a human being may pass into another mortal body\r\nor into a lower stage, into an animal or even a plant, has been\r\nused considerably in English fiction. This Oriental belief has its\r\nbasis in antiquity, in animistic ideas in primitive culture. One\r\nof the earliest appearances of the theme in English fiction is that\r\nmiddle-eighteenth-century story of Dr. John Hawkesworth's,[168] an\r\naccount of a soul that has not behaved itself seemly, so descends in\r\nthe spiritual scale till it ends by being a flea. The German Hoffmann\r\nused the theme repeatedly, and Poe, who was to a certain extent\r\ninfluenced by his supernaturalism, employs it in several stories. In _A\r\nTale of the Ragged Mountains_, the young man named Bedlo experiences,\r\nin dreams of extraordinary vividness, the life of battle, of confusion,\r\nending in death, in a tropical city. He sees himself die, struck on the\r\ntemple by a poisoned arrow. He is recognized by an elderly man as the\r\nexact counterpart of a Mr. Oldeb who perished in the manner dreamed of\r\nin a battle in Benares. Mr. Bedlo, while wandering in the mountains of\r\nVirginia, contracts a cold and fever, for the cure of which leeches\r\nare applied, but by mistake a poisonous sangsue is substituted for\r\nthe leech, and the patient dies of a wound on the temple, similar\r\nto that caused by a poisoned arrow. Poe's concept in other stories\r\nis not that of the conventionally easy passage of the soul into the\r\nbody of a new-born babe that wouldn't be expected to put up much of\r\na fight, but he makes the psychic feature the central horror, saying\r\nin that connection that man is on the brink of tremendous psychical\r\ndiscoveries. In _Morella_ the theme is used with telling power, where\r\nthe wife, once greatly loved but now loathed, on her deathbed tells her\r\nhusband that her child will live after her. The daughter grows up into\r\nsupernatural likeness of her mother, but remains nameless, since her\r\nfather, for a reason he cannot analyze, hesitates to give her any name.\r\nBut at last, as she stands before the altar to be christened, some\r\nforce outside the father causes him to call her Morella.\r\n\r\n  What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and\r\n  overspread them with the hues of death, as, starting at that\r\n  scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from earth to\r\n  heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral\r\n  vault, responded, \"I am here\"!\r\n\r\n      [168] _The Transmigration of a Soul._\r\n\r\nThe young girl is found to be dead and the father says: \"With my own\r\nhands I bore her to the tomb; and I laughed, with a long and bitter\r\nlaugh, as I found no traces of the first in the charnel where I laid\r\nthe second Morella.\"\r\n\r\nAn obvious imitation of Poe's story is found in Bram Stoker's novel,\r\n_The Jewel of Seven Stars_, where the soul of an Egyptian princess\r\nenters into the body of a baby born to one of the explorers who rifle\r\nher tomb. The child grows into the perfect duplicate of the princess,\r\neven showing on her wrists the marks of violence that cut off the\r\nmummy's hand. The Egyptian's familiar, a mummified cat, comes to life\r\nto revenge itself upon the archæologists who have disturbed the tomb.\r\nWhen by magic incantations and scientific experiments combined, the\r\ncollectors try to revivify the mummy, the body mysteriously disappears,\r\nand the young girl is found dead, leading us to suppose that the\r\nreanimated princess has stolen the girl's life for her own.\r\n\r\nIn _Ligeia_, another of Poe's morbid studies of metempsychosis, the\r\ntheme is clearly announced, as quoted from Joseph Glanville: \"Man\r\ndoth not yield himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save only\r\nthrough the weakness of his own feeble will.\" The worshipped Ligeia\r\ndies, and in an hour of madness her husband marries the Lady Rowena.\r\nThe bride soon sickens and as the husband watches alone by her bed\r\nat midnight, he sees drops of ruby liquid fall from some mysterious\r\nsource, into the wine he is offering her. When the Lady Rowena\r\npresently dies, the husband, again alone with her, sees the corpse\r\nundergo an awful transformation. It is reanimated, but the body that\r\nlives is not that of Rowena, but of Ligeia, who has come back to life\r\nagain by exerting her deathless will over the physical being of her\r\nrival. The climax with which the story closes has perhaps no parallel\r\nin fiction. As for the ruby drops, are we to think of them as an elixir\r\nof life for the dead Ligeia struggling back to being, or as poison to\r\nslay the living Rowena?\r\n\r\nLigeia's story is reflected, or at least shows an evident influence, in\r\n_The Second Wife_, by Mary Heaton Vorse. Here again the dead wife comes\r\nto oust her supplanter, but in this instance the interloper does not\r\ndie, but without dying merely _becomes_ the person and the personality\r\nof the first wife. The change is gradual but incontrovertible, felt by\r\nthe woman herself before it is complete, and noticed by the husband\r\nand the mother-in-law. Here the human will, indestructible by death,\r\nasserts itself over mortal flesh and effects a transfer of personality.\r\nBut where did the second wife's soul go, pray,--the \"she o' the she\" as\r\nPatience Worth would say?\r\n\r\nA similar transfer of soul, effected while both persons are living\r\nbut caused by the malignance of an evil dead spirit, is found in\r\nBlackwood's _The Terror of the Twins_. A father, who resents the fact\r\nthat instead of a single heir twins are born to him, swears in his\r\nmadness before he dies, that before their majority he will bring it to\r\npass that there shall be only _one_. By the help of powers from the\r\nPit he filches from the younger his vitality, his strength of mind and\r\nsoul and body, his personality, and gives this access of power to the\r\nelder. The younger dies a hopeless idiot and the elder lives on with\r\na double dower of being. Ambrose Bierce carries this idea to a climax\r\nof horror,[169] when he makes an evil spirit take possession of a dead\r\nmother's body and slay her son, who recognizes his loved mother's\r\nface, knows that it is her eyes that glare fiend-like at him, her hands\r\nthat are strangling him,--yet cannot know that it is a hideous fiend in\r\nher corpse.\r\n\r\n      [169] In _The Death of Halpin Frazer_.\r\n\r\nThe theme of metempsychosis is found tangled up with various other\r\nmotives in fiction, the use of the elixir of life, hypnotism,\r\ndream-supernaturalism, witchcraft and so forth. Rider Haggard has\r\ngiven a curious combination of metempsychosis, and the supernatural\r\ncontinuance of life by means of the elixir, in _She_ and its sequel,\r\n_Ayesha_. The wonderful woman, the dread She-who-must-be-obeyed who\r\nkeeps her youth and beauty by means of bathing in the magic fluid,\r\nrecognizes in various stages of her existence the lover whom she has\r\nknown thousands of years before. Not having the advantage of the\r\nTurkish bath or patent medicine, he dies periodically and has to be\r\nborn all over again in some other century. This is agitating to the\r\nlady, so she determines to inoculate him with immortality so that\r\nthey can reign together without those troublesome interruptions of\r\nmortality. But the impatient lover insists on kissing her, which proves\r\ntoo much for him, since her divinity is fatal to mere mankind, so he\r\ndies again.\r\n\r\nThe close relation between metempsychosis and hypnotism is shown in\r\nvarious stories. Several cases of troublesome atavistic personality or\r\nreincarnation are cured by psychotherapy. Theodora, a young woman in a\r\nnovel by Frances Fenwick Williams, bearing that title-name, realizes\r\nherself to be the reincarnation of a remote ancestress, an Orientalist,\r\na witch, who has terrorized the country with her sorceries. She is\r\ncured of her mental hauntings by means of hypnotism. Another novel by\r\nthe same author,[170] gives also the reincarnation of a witch character\r\nin modern life, with a cure effected by psycho-analysis. The young\r\nwoman discovers herself to be the heiress of a curse, which is removed\r\nonly after study of pre-natal influences and investigations concerning\r\nthe subconscious self.\r\n\r\n      [170] _A Soul on Fire._\r\n\r\nAs is seen by these examples, the relation between witchcraft\r\nand metempsychosis is very close, since in recent fiction the\r\nwitch characters have unusual powers of returning to life in some\r\nother form. In Algernon Blackwood's _Ancient Sorceries_, we have\r\nwitch-metempsychosis on a large scale, the population of a whole\r\nvillage being but the reanimations of long-dead witches and wizards\r\nwho once lived there. I know of no other case of mob-metempsychosis\r\nin English fiction, but the instances where several are reincarnated\r\nat once are numerous. Algernon Blackwood's recent novel, _Jules Le\r\nVallon_, is based on a story of collective reincarnation, the chief\r\ncharacters in the dramatic action realizing that they have lived\r\nand been associated with each other before, and feeling that they\r\nmust expiate a sin of a previous existence. Another recent novel by\r\nBlackwood, _The Wave_, has for its theme the reincarnation of the\r\nprincipal characters, realized by them. Blackwood has been much drawn\r\nto psychic subjects in general and metempsychosis in particular, for\r\nit enters into many of his stories. In _Old Clothes_ he gives us an\r\ninstance of a child who knows herself to be the reborn personality of\r\nsome one else and suffers poignantly in reliving the experiences of\r\nthat long-dead ancestress, while those around her are recognized as\r\nthe companions of her life of the far past, though they are unaware of\r\nit. The fatuous remark of lovers in fiction, that they feel that they\r\nhave lived and loved each other in a previous existence, is a literary\r\nbromide now, but has its basis in a recurrence in fiction. Antonio\r\nFogazzaro's novel, _The Woman_, is a good example in Italian,--for the\r\nwoman feels that she and her lover are reincarnations of long-dead\r\nselves who have suffered tragic experiences together, which morbid idea\r\nculminates in tragic madness.\r\n\r\n_The Mystery of Joseph Laquedem_, by A. T. Quiller-Couch, is a\r\nstriking story of dual reincarnation. A young Jew in England and a\r\nhalf-witted girl, a farmer's daughter, recognize in each other and\r\nin themselves, the personalities of a young Jew led to the lions\r\nfor becoming a Christian, and a Roman princess who loved him. They\r\nrecall their successive lives wherein they have known and loved each\r\nother, to be separated by cruel destiny each time, but at last they\r\ndie a tragic death together. The character of the man here is given\r\nadditional interest for us in that he is said to be a reincarnation of\r\nCartapholus, Pilate's porter, who struck Jesus, bidding Him go faster,\r\nand who is immortalized as the Wandering Jew. Here he lives successive\r\nlives rather than a continuous existence. Somewhat similar to this\r\nis another combination of hypnotism and metempsychosis in _The Witch\r\nof Prague_, by F. Marion Crawford, where Uorna makes Israel Kafka go\r\nthrough the physical and psychical tortures of Simon Abeles, a young\r\nJew killed by his people for becoming a Christian. By hypnotism the\r\nyoung man is made to pass through the experiences of a dead youth of\r\nwhom he has never heard, and to die his death anew.\r\n\r\nThere is a close relation between dreams and metempsychosis, as is seen\r\nin certain stories. Kipling's charming prose idyll, _The Brushwood\r\nBoy_, may be called a piece of dream-metempsychosis, for the youth and\r\ngirl when they first meet in real life recognize in each other the\r\ncompanions of their childhood and adolescent dream-life, and complete\r\ntheir dual memories. They have dreamed the same dreams even to minute\r\ndetails of conversation, and familiar names. Du Maurier combines the\r\ntwo motives very skillfully in his novels, for it is in successive\r\ndreams that the Martian reveals herself to Barty Joscelyn telling him\r\nof her life on another planet, and inspiring him to write--or writing\r\nfor him--books of genius, before she takes up earthly life in one\r\nof his children. She tells him that she will come to him no more in\r\ndreams, but that she will live in the child that is to be born. And in\r\ndual dreams Peter Ibbetson and the Duchess of Towers live over again\r\ntheir childhood life together, are able to find at will their golden\r\nyesterdays, and know in happy reality the joys of the past, while the\r\npresent keeps them cruelly apart. They are able to call back to shadowy\r\nlife their common ancestors, to see and hear the joys, the work, the\r\ngriefs they knew so long ago. They plumb their sub-consciousness, dream\r\nover again their sub-dreams, until they at last not only see these\r\nlong-dead men and women, but _become_ them.\r\n\r\n  We could each be Gatienne for a space (though not both of us\r\n  together) and when we resumed our own personality again we carried\r\n  back with it a portion of hers, never to be lost again--strange\r\n  phenomenon if the reader will but think of it, and constituting the\r\n  germ of a comparative personal immortality on earth.\r\n\r\nNot only does Peter live in the past, but he has the power to transport\r\nthese dead ancestors of his to his present and let them share in his\r\nlife, so that Gatienne, a French woman dead for generations, lives\r\nover again in an English prison as Peter Ibbetson, or travels as Mary\r\nTowers, seeing things she never had dreamed of in her own life.\r\n\r\nH. G. Wells in _A Dream of Armageddon_ gives a curious story of the\r\ndream-future. A man in consecutive visions sees himself killed. He then\r\ndreams that he is another man, living in a different part of the world,\r\nfar in the future, till he sees himself die in his second personality.\r\nHe describes his experiences as given in \"a dream so accurate that\r\nafterwards you remember little details you had forgotten.\" He suffers\r\ntortures of love and grief, so that his dream-life of the future is\r\ninfinitely more real to him than his actual existence of his own time.\r\nWhat was the real \"him o' him,\" to quote Patience Worth, the man of the\r\ndream-future, or the business man of the present telling the story to\r\nhis friend?\r\n\r\nA different version of metempsychosis is shown in _The Immortal\r\nGymnasts_, by Marie Cher, for here the beloved trio, Pantaloon,\r\nHarlequin and Columbine are embodied as human beings and come to live\r\namong men. Harlequin has the power of magic vision which enables him to\r\nsee into the minds and hearts of mortals by means of \"cloud-currents.\"\r\nThis question of--shall we say transmigration?--of fictive characters\r\ninto actual life is found in various stories, such as Kipling's _The\r\nLast of the Stories_, John Kendrick Bangs' _The Rebellious Heroine_,\r\nand others. It illustrates the fantastic use to which every serious\r\ntheme is sooner or later put. There is no motif in supernatural\r\nliterature that is not parodied in some form or other, if only by\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe symbolic treatment of metempsychosis is strongly evident in\r\nrecent fiction, as the theme lends itself particularly well to the\r\nallegoric and symbolic style. Barry Pain's _Exchange_ shows aspects\r\nof transmigration different from the conventional treatment, for he\r\ndescribes the soul of the old man as giving up its right to peace that\r\nit might purchase ease for a soul he loved. He passes into the body of\r\na captive bird beating its hopeless wings against the bars and tortured\r\nwith pain and thirst, as a mark of the witch woman's wrath, while the\r\nsoul of the young girl goes into the body of a snow-white lamb that\r\nlives a day then is set free. As she passes by, in the state of a freed\r\nsoul, she sees the piteous bird, and says to herself, \"I am glad I was\r\nnever a bird.\"\r\n\r\nAlgernon Blackwood, in _The Return_, gives a peculiar story of\r\nmetempsychosis, where the selfish materialist finds himself suddenly\r\nreinforced with a new personality from without. His eyes are opened\r\nmiraculously to the magic and beauty of the world, and he knows beyond\r\ndoubt that his friend, the artist, who promised to come to him when he\r\ndied, has died and that his soul has become a part of his own being.\r\nThe most impressive example of this sudden merging of two natures, two\r\nsouls into one, is found in Granville Barker's _Souls on Fifth_. Here a\r\nman suddenly acquires, or recognizes, the power to see the souls that\r\nlinger earth-bound around him, and comes to have a strange sympathy\r\nwith that of a woman, whom he calls the \"Little Soul.\" When he speaks\r\nof going away, after a time, she begs him not to leave her since she\r\nis very lonely in this wilderness of unbodied souls. She asks that if\r\nhe will not take her into his soul, he carry her to some wide prairie,\r\nand there in the unspaced expanse leave her,--but instead he gives a\r\nreluctant consent for her to enter into his life. He presses the little\r\nsymbolic figure to his heart, then feels a new sense of being, of\r\npersonality, and knows that her soul has become forever a part of his.\r\n\r\nLord Dunsany, who lends a strange, new beauty to every supernatural\r\ntheme he touches, has a little prose-poem of symbolic metempsychosis,\r\ncalled _Usury_, where Yohu, one of the evil spirits, lures the shadows\r\nto work for him by giving them gleaming lives to polish.\r\n\r\n  And ever Yohu lures more shadows and sends them to brighten his\r\n  Lives, sending the old Lives out again to make them brighter still;\r\n  and sometimes he gives to a shadow a Life that was once a king's\r\n  and sendeth him with it down to the earth to play the part of a\r\n  beggar, or sometimes he sendeth a beggar's Life to play the part of\r\n  a king. What careth Yohu?\r\n\r\n=Spiritualism and Psychical Research.= The influence of modern\r\nSpiritualism and Psychical Research on the literature of supernaturalism\r\nhas been marked, especially of late years. It would be inevitable that\r\nmovements which interest so many persons, among them many of more\r\nthan ordinary intelligence, should be reflected in fiction. These two\r\naspects of the subject will be treated together since they are closely\r\nallied. For though Spiritualism is a form of religion and Psychical\r\nResearch a new science,--and so-called religion and so-called science\r\nare not always parallel--the lines of investigation here are similar.\r\nWhile Spiritualism endeavors to get in touch with the spirits of the\r\ndead that the living may be comforted and enlightened, and Psychical\r\nResearch attempts to classify the supposedly authentic cases of\r\nsuch communication, and in so much their methods of approach are\r\ndifferent,--yet the results may be discussed together.\r\n\r\nHawthorne was interested in Spiritualism as literary material, since\r\na discussion of it is introduced in _Blithedale Romance_ and various\r\npassages in his notebooks treat of the matter showing the fascination\r\nit had for him. Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, in addition to her\r\nfictional treatises of heaven, takes up Spiritualism as well. In _The\r\nDay of My Death_ she gives a satiric account of the return of a spirit\r\nwho says he is a lost soul tortured in hell. He doubtless deserves\r\nit, for he sticks the baby full of pins and ties it to a tree, and\r\nfolds the clothes from the wash in the shape of corpses. He is still\r\ninterested in this life, however, since he requests a piece of squash\r\npie. In _Kentucky's Ghost_ she depicts a spirit actuated by definite\r\nmalice. In the previous story seven mediums tell a man that he will die\r\nat a certain day and hour, but he lives cheerfully on.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dean Howells has given a study in his usual kindly satire\r\nand sympathetic seriousness, of the phenomena of Spiritualism and\r\nmesmerism, in _The Undiscovered Country_. Dr. Boynton, a mistaken\r\nzealot, holds seances assisted by his daughter, a delicate, sensitive\r\ngirl who is physically prostrated after each performance and begs her\r\nfather to spare her. She acts as medium where the usual effects of\r\nrapping, table levitation, and so forth take place, where spirit hands\r\nwave in the air and messages, grave and jocular, are delivered. The\r\ncharacterization is handled with skill to bring out the sincerity of\r\neach person involved in the web of superstition and false belief, and\r\nHowells shows real sympathy with each, the scoffers as well as the\r\nmisguided fanatics. It is only when the doctor looks death in the face\r\nthat he realizes his error and seeks to know by faith in the Bible the\r\ntruths of the far country of the soul.\r\n\r\nHamlin Garland has shown considerable interest in Spiritualism in his\r\nfiction. He refuses to commit himself as to his own opinion of the\r\nquestion, but he has written two novels dealing with it, _The Tyranny\r\nof the Dark_ and _The Shadow World_. The former is considerably like\r\nHowells's novel, for here also a young girl is made the innocent victim\r\nof fanatics, her mother and a preacher who has fallen in love with her.\r\nShe is made to take part in spiritualistic manifestations, whether as\r\na victim of fraud or as a genuine medium the author leaves in doubt.\r\nWhen the girl casts him off the preacher kills himself that he may come\r\ninto closer communication with her after death than he has been able\r\nto do in life. Richard Harding Davis has contributed a volume with a\r\nsimilar plot, the exploitation of an innocent and, of course, beautiful\r\ngirl by fanatics, in _Vera the Medium_. Here the girl is more than half\r\naware that she is a fraud and in her last seance, at the conclusion\r\nof which she is to be carried triumphantly away by her lover, the New\r\nYork district attorney, she dramatically confesses her deception. As a\r\nsympathy-getter, she pleads that she was very lonely, that because her\r\ngrandmother and mother were mediums, she had been cut off from society.\r\n\"I used to play round the kitchen stove with Pocahontas and Alexander\r\nthe Great, and Martin Luther lived in our china closet.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Belasco's _The Return of Peter Grimm_, drama and novel, is based\r\nupon spiritualistic manifestations. We are told that the \"envelope\"\r\nor shadow-self of a sleeper has been photographed by means of\r\nradio-photography. When a certain part of the shadow body is pricked\r\nwith a pin, as the cheek, the corresponding portion of the sleeper's\r\nbody is seen to bleed. Peter Grimm comes back from the other world to\r\ndirect the actions of the living, and though at first only a child sees\r\nhim,--for children are the best sensitives save animals,--eventually\r\nthe adults recognize him also and yield to his guidance. Spiritualism\r\nenters directly or indirectly into many works of fiction of late years.\r\nWhether people believe in it or not, they are thinking and writing\r\nabout it. The subject receives its usual humorous turn in various\r\nstories, as Nelson Lloyd's _The Last Ghost in Harmony_, the story of\r\na specter who complains of the scientific unimaginativeness of his\r\nvillage, saying that though he had entreated the spooks to hold out for\r\na little while as he had heard Spiritualism was headed that way and\r\nwould bring about a revival of interest in ghosts, the spirits all got\r\ndiscouraged and quit the place. And we recall Sandy's mournful comment\r\nto Mark Twain's Captain Stormfield, that he wished there was something\r\n_in_ that miserable Spiritualism, so he could send word back to the\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nThe Proceedings of the Psychical Research Society have a twofold\r\nassociation with literature, for not only have various modern novels\r\nand stories been inspired by such material, but the instances recorded\r\nare similar in many cases to the classical ghost stories. Lacy\r\nCollison-Morley in his _Greek and Roman Ghost Stories_ says, \"There\r\nare a number of stories of the passing of souls which are curiously\r\nlike some of those collected by the Psychical Research Society, in\r\nthe Fourth Book of Gregory the Great's _Dialogues_.\" The double\r\nsource of many modern stories may be found by a comparative study of\r\nCollison-Morley's book and Myers's _Human Personality_, while G. H.\r\nGerould's volume, _The Grateful Dead_, introduces recent instances that\r\nare like classical stories. The inability of the soul to have rest in\r\nthe other world if its body was unburied, as held by the ancients,\r\nis reflected in Gothic romance, Elizabethan drama as well as in the\r\nclassics. The ghost of Jack, whom Peele tells us about, is a case of a\r\nghost coming back to befriend his undertaker. From these comparisons\r\nit would appear that there is something inherently true to humanity\r\nin these beliefs, for the revenge ghost and the grateful dead have\r\nappeared all along the line. Perhaps human personality is largely the\r\nsame in all lands and all times, and ghosts have the same elemental\r\nemotions however much they may have acquired a veneer of modernity.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of the compact-ghost, the spirit who returns\r\njust after death in accordance with a promise made in life, to manifest\r\nhimself to some friend or to some skeptic. Algernon Blackwood gives\r\nseveral stories based on that theme, one a curious case where the ghost\r\nis so lifelike his friend does not dream he is not the living man,\r\nand assigns him to a bedroom. Later he is invisible, yet undoubtedly\r\npresent, for his heavy breathing, movements of the covers, and impress\r\non the bed are beyond dispute. _Afterwards_, by Fred C. Smale, shows a\r\nghost returning to attend a neighborhood club. When his name is called\r\nby mistake, he takes part on the program, speaking through the lips of\r\na young man present, who goes off in a cataleptic trance. During this\r\ncoma the youth, who is ignorant of music, gives a technical discussion\r\nof notation, analyzing diatonic semi-tones and discussing the note a\r\nnightingale trills on. When he wakes he says he has felt a chill and\r\na touch. Alice Brown relates a story of a lover who promised to come\r\nto his sweetheart at the moment of death, but who, like Ahimeas in the\r\nBible, runs before he is ready, and keeps his ghostly tryst while the\r\nrescuers bring him back to life. He hasn't really been drowned at all.\r\n\r\nA recent novelette by Frances Hodgson Burnett, called _The White\r\nPeople_, has psychical phenomena for its central interest. A little\r\nchild, born after her father's tragic death and when her dying mother\r\nis conscious of his spiritual presence, grows up with a strange\r\nsensitiveness to manifestations from the other world. Her home is\r\non a lonely estate in Scotland, so that her chief companionship is\r\nwith the \"white people,\" the spirits of the dead, though she does not\r\nso recognize them. Her playmate is Wee Brown Elsbeth, who has been\r\nmurdered hundreds of years before, and she is able to see the dead\r\nhover near their loved ones wherever she goes. So when she comes to\r\nrealize what a strange vision is hers, she has no horror of death, and\r\nwhen her lover dies she does not grieve, but waits to see him stand\r\nsmiling beside her as in life. The theme of the story is the nearness\r\nof the dead to the living, the thin texture of the veil that separates\r\nthe two worlds.\r\n\r\nBasil King tells a poignant story of a soul trying vainly to return in\r\nbody to right a wrong done in life but unable to accomplish her purpose\r\nby physical means. At last she effects it by impressing the mind of\r\na living woman who carries out the suggestion psychically given. One\r\nof the most effective recent accounts of a spirit's return to earth\r\nto influence the life of the living, to give messages or to control\r\ndestiny, is in Ellen Glasgow's _The Shadowy Third_. Here the ghost of\r\na child, a little girl whom her stepfather has done to death for her\r\nmoney, returns to cause his death in an unusual way. She throws her\r\nlittle skipping-rope carelessly on the stairway where he must trip up\r\nin it when he sees her phantom figure in front of him in the gloom, so\r\nto fall headlong to his death. This is an impressive revenge ghost.\r\n\r\nHenry James based his ghost story, _The Turn of the Screw_, on an\r\nincident reported to the Psychical Society, of a spectral old woman\r\ncorrupting the mind of a child. The central character in Arnold\r\nBennett's novel, _The Ghost_, is a specter, one of the most rabid\r\nrevenge ghosts in literature, who is eaten up with jealousy lest\r\nthe woman he loved in life shall care for some one else. Algernon\r\nBlackwood uses much psychical material in his numberless stories of the\r\nsupernatural, often mentioning the work of the Society, and Andrew Lang\r\nhas contributed much to the subject. Arthur Machen has just published a\r\ncollection of stories of war-apparitions that are interesting psychical\r\nspecimens, called _The Bowmen_. In one story in the volume he shows us\r\nhow a contemporary legend may be built up, since from a short piece of\r\nfiction written by him has evolved the mass of material relating to the\r\nangels at Mons. One tale is a story of the supernatural intervention of\r\nSaint George and his army to drive back the Germans and save the hour\r\nfor the Allies, while another describes the vision of a soldier wounded\r\nin battle defending his comrades, who sees the long-dead heroes of\r\nEngland file past him to praise him for his valor. The minister gives\r\nhim wine to drink and\r\n\r\n  His voice was hushed. For as he looked at the minister the fashion\r\n  of his vesture was changed. He was all in armor, if armor be made\r\n  of starlight, of the rose of dawn, and of sunset fires; and he\r\n  lifted up a great sword of flame.\r\n\r\n   \"Full in the midst, his Cross of Red\r\n    Triumphant Michael brandished\r\n    And trampled the Apostate's pride.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case of collective apparitions is the experience of a soldier,\r\nwounded in battle, who tells of strange fighters who have come in to\r\naid the English. He thinks they are some of the tribesmen that Britain\r\nemploys, but from his descriptions the minister knows that they are the\r\nlong-dead Greeks who have arisen to take part in the struggle which\r\ntheir modern descendants are reluctant to share. These stories are only\r\na few among the many instances of supernaturalism in fiction traceable\r\nto the influence of the war.\r\n\r\nCertain volumes of ghost stories have appeared, claiming to be not\r\nfiction but fact, accounts of actual apparitions seen and snap-shotted.\r\nThis sort of problematic fiction is not new, however, since Defoe long\r\nago published one of the best of the kind, the story of Mrs. Veal, who\r\nappeared to her friend Mrs. Bargrave, and conversed with her, gravely\r\ntelling her that heaven is much like the descriptions in a certain\r\nreligious book written shortly before that. She seems very realistic,\r\nwith her dress of newly scoured silk, which her friend rubs between\r\nher fingers, and her lifelike conversation. This story has usually\r\nbeen regarded as one of Defoe's \"lies like truth,\" but recent evidence\r\nleads one to believe that it is a reportorial account of a ghost story\r\ncurrent at the time, which missed being reported to the Society for\r\nPsychical Research merely because the organization did not exist then.\r\nThe modern stories that stridently claim to be real lack the interest\r\nin many instances that Mrs. Veal is able to impart, and in most cases\r\nthe reader loses his taste for that sort of fiction because it is\r\nrammed down his throat for fact. They don't impress one, either as fact\r\nor as fiction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the literature relating to\r\npsychic matters in recent years is the number of books that claim to\r\nbe spirit-inspired. These instances of psychography are not what we\r\nmight expect immortals to indite, but it appears that there must be a\r\nmarked decrease of intelligence when one reaches the other world. The\r\nmessages sent back by dead genius lack the master style, even lacking\r\nthat control over spelling and grammar which low, earth-bound editors\r\nconsider necessary. But perhaps the spirits of the great grow tired\r\nof being made messenger boys, and show their resentment by literary\r\nstrikes. Anita Silvani has published several volumes that she claims\r\nwere written while she was in a semi-trance,--which statement no reader\r\nwill doubt. Her accommodating dictator furnishes illustrations for\r\nher stuff, as well, for she says she would have inner visions of the\r\nscenes described, \"as if a dioram passed\" before her. These romances\r\nof three worlds are quite peculiar productions. The inner voices asked\r\nher in advance not to read any literature on theosophy or Spiritualism\r\nor the supernatural since they wished her mind to be free from any\r\nprevious bias. Mrs. Elsa Barker is another of these literary mediums,\r\nfor she has put out two volumes of letters in narrative form, which\r\nshe makes affidavit were dictated to her by a disembodied spirit, the\r\nghost of the late Judge Hatch, of California. She states that while\r\nshe was sitting in her room in Paris one day, her hand was violently\r\nseized, a pencil thrust into it, and the automatic writing began. Mrs.\r\nCampbell-Praed is another of these feminine stenographers for spooks,\r\nbut like the rest she has left nothing that could well be included\r\nin a literary anthology. These spirit-writers tell us of life after\r\ndeath, but nothing that is a contribution to existing ignorance on the\r\nsubject. According to Judge Hatch, whose post-mortem pen-name is X, the\r\npresent war has its parallel in a conflict of spirits, and the astral\r\nworld is in dire confusion because of overcrowding, so that the souls\r\nof the slain must go through torments and struggle with demons.\r\n\r\nThe most recent instance of psychography comes to us by way of the\r\nouija-board from St. Louis, the authenticity of which is vouched for\r\nby Mr. Casper Yost, of the editorial staff of the _Globe-Democrat_.\r\nBut if the ouija-board dictated the stories and plays, giving the name\r\nof Patience Worth as the spirit author, and if Mrs. Curran took them\r\ndown, why does Mr. Yost appear as the author? Patience Worth says\r\nthat she lived a long time ago. Mr. Yost insists that her language is\r\nElizabethan, but it seems rather a curious conglomeration, unlike any\r\nElizabethan style I am familiar with. She has written stories, lyrics,\r\na long drama, and other informal compositions, a marvelous output when\r\none considers the slow movements of the ouija-board. The communications\r\nseem to have human interest and a certain literary value, though they\r\nbring us no messages from the Elizabethan section of eternity.[171]\r\n\r\n      [171] Other examples of the books that claim to be inspired\r\n      by spirits are: _An Angel Message_, Being a Series of Angelic\r\n      and Holy Communications Received by a Lady; _Nyria_, by Mrs.\r\n      Campbell-Praed; _Letters from a Living Dead Man_, by Elsa\r\n      Barker, and _War Letters from a Living Dead Man_; _Stranger\r\n      than Fiction_, by Mary L. Lewis; _The Soul of the Moor_, by\r\n      Stratford Jolly; _Ida Lymond and Her Hour of Vision_, by Hope\r\n      Crawford; _The Life Elysian_; _The Car of Phoebus_; _The\r\n      Heretic_; _An Astral Bridegroom_; _Through the Mists_, _The\r\n      Vagrom Spirit_, and _Leaves from the Autobiography of a Soul in\r\n      Paradise_, by Robert James Lee. This last-named gentleman seems\r\n      to be in touch with spirits as rapid in composition as Robert\r\n      W. Chambers.\r\n\r\nAutomatic writing appears in _The Martian_ by Du Maurier, where the\r\nspirit from Mars causes Barty Joscelyn in his sleep to write books\r\nimpossible to him in his waking hours. The type has been parodied by\r\nJohn Kendrick Bangs in his _Enchanted Typewriter_, which machine worked\r\nindustriously recording telegraphic despatches from across the Styx.\r\nThe invisible operator gives his name as Jim Boswell. The writer states:\r\n\r\n  The substance of the following pages has evolved itself between the\r\n  hours of midnight and four o'clock, during a period of six months,\r\n  from a type-writing machine standing in a corner of my library,\r\n  manipulated by unseen hands.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how many ghosts are trying to break into print\r\nthese days. And after all, what do the poor things get out of it? No\r\nroyalties, scant praise, and much ridicule when their style fails to\r\ncome up to specifications.\r\n\r\nInteresting psychical material is found in a new volume of plays by\r\nTheodore Dreiser.[172] He gives curious twists to the unearthly, as\r\nin _The Blue Sphere_, where a shadow and a fast mail are among the\r\n_dramatis personæ_, typifying the fate idea of the old drama. The\r\nshadow lures a child monstrosity out on to the railway track, after\r\nhe has caused the elders to leave the gate open, and the train, made\r\nvery human, kills the child. The psychic effects in _In the Dark_\r\nare even more peculiar, the characters including various spirits, a\r\nwraith, and a ghost with red eyes, who circle round the human beings\r\nand force them to discover a murder that has been committed. The effect\r\nof supernatural manifestation on animals is brought out here, in the\r\nbellowing of the bull and the howling of the dogs as the ghosts pass\r\nby. In _A Spring Recital_ troops of nymphs and hamadryads, fauns,\r\nclouds of loathsome spirits of hags and wastrels, \"persistences\" of\r\nfish, birds, and animals, \"various living and newly dead spirits\r\nwandering in from the street,\" the ghost of an English minister of St.\r\nGiles, who died in 1631, a monk of the Thebaid, of date 300 and three\r\npriests of Isis of 2840 B.C. enter to hear the organist play. He is\r\nunaware that anybody is hearing his music save the four human beings\r\nwho have happened in. These dramas of course are purely literary\r\nplays, impossible of presentation on the stage, and in their curious\r\ncharacter show a likeness to some of the late German supernaturalism,\r\nsuch as the plays of August Stramm. They show in an extreme form the\r\ntendency toward psychic material that the American and English drama\r\nhas evidenced lately.\r\n\r\n      [172] _Plays of the Natural and the Supernatural._\r\n\r\n=Life after Death.= Mankind is immensely interested in heaven and\r\nhell, though he knows but little concerning these places. But man is\r\na born traveler and gives much thought to distant countries, whether\r\nhe definitely expects to go there or not. This interest is no new\r\nthing, for classical mythology is full of doleful accounts of the\r\nafter life. The early English stage represented heaven and hell in\r\naddition to the earth, and Elizabethan drama shows many references to\r\nthe underworld, with a strong Senecan influence. There are especially\r\nfrequent allusions to certain famous sufferers in Hades, as Ixion,\r\nTantalus, Sisyphus, and Tityus. Modern English fiction has likewise\r\nbeen influenced by the epic supernaturalism, reflecting the heaven and\r\nhell of Dante and Milton. Yet as in his own thinking each person lays\r\nout a Celestial City for himself and pictures his own inferno to fit\r\nhis ideas of mercy and justice, peopling them with appropriate beings,\r\nchanging and coloring the conceptions of Bunyan, for instance, to suit\r\nhis own desires, so it is in fiction. Some think of heaven and hell as\r\ndefinite places, while to others they are states of mind. To some the\r\ndevil is as real as in the darkey folk-song, where,\r\n\r\n   \"Up stepped de debbil\r\n    Wid his iron wooden shubbil,\r\n    Tearin' up de yearth wid his big-toe nail!\"\r\n\r\nwhile to others he is an iconoclastic new thought. Heaven and\r\nhell have been treated in every conceivable way in English\r\nfiction--conventionally, symbolically, humorously, and satirically, so\r\nthat one may choose the type he prefers. There are enough kinds to go\r\naround.\r\n\r\nAmong the portrayers of the traditional heaven and hell Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nStuart Phelps Ward is prominent. Her works on contemporary immortality\r\nare said to have had a tremendous vogue in the period following\r\nthe Civil War, when death had claimed so many that the living were\r\nthinking of the other world more than of this. Her pictures of heaven\r\nin _Gates Ajar_ are comforting, for she assures to each person his own\r\ndearest wish in fulfillment, to the ambitious youth his books, to the\r\nyoung girl her piano, and to the small child her ginger-snaps instead\r\nof earthly bread and butter. In _The Gates Between_ the physician,\r\nsuddenly killed, finds himself embarrassed by immortality. He doesn't\r\nknow how to adjust himself to eternity and at first brings many of\r\nearth's problems with him. In the third of the series, _The Gates\r\nBeyond_, she describes a very material yet spiritual heaven. Bodies are\r\nmuch like those on earth, not vaporous projections; there are museums,\r\nhospitals, universities, telephones, concerts and all up-to-date\r\nimprovements and conveniences. The dead woman discovers that she\r\nremembers what she read on earth, takes pleasure in simple things such\r\nas the smell of mignonette, hears the birds sing a Te Deum, while a\r\nbrook and a bird sing a duet, and the leaves are also vocal. There is a\r\nUniversal Language which must be learned by each soul, and heaven holds\r\nall sorts of occupations, material, mental, and spiritual. She says\r\nthat near earth are many earth-bound spirits occupied in low and coarse\r\nand selfish ways, who lack \"spiritual momentum to get away.\" \"They\r\nloved nothing, lived for nothing, believed in nothing, they cultivated\r\nthemselves for nothing but the earth,\"--which may be compared with the\r\nstate of the souls on Fifth Avenue, described by Granville Barker.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward's pictures of heaven may seem sentimental and conventional to\r\nus to-day, yet to be appreciated they must be considered in relation to\r\nthe religious thought of her time. She represented a reaction against\r\nthe rigid theology, the stern concepts of an older generation than\r\nher own, and she wished to make heaven more homelike. She did have an\r\ninfluence in her day, as may be illustrated by a remark from a sermon\r\nrecently delivered by a New York pastor, that the reading of her books\r\nhad exerted a great influence over him, that they made heaven over for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oliphant is another of the conductors of fictive Cook's tours\r\nthrough heaven and hell, after the fashion started by Dante and Milton,\r\nand modernized by Mrs. Ward. She devotes volumes to describing the\r\nfuture worlds in their relation to mortal destiny. One story[173]\r\ntells of a soul that comes back from purgatory to be comforted by the\r\nold minister and sent away happy; another[174] is the account of a\r\nspirit returning from heaven to right a wrong that her husband is doing\r\nanother. Still another[175] gives the experiences of a woman who is\r\ndistressed when she finds herself in heaven, because she has hidden her\r\nwill and her young niece is thereby left penniless, but she asks advice\r\nof various celestial authorities and finally succeeds in returning to\r\nearth and righting matters. _A Beleaguered City_ is a peculiar story\r\nof a French town besieged by the dead, who drive out the inhabitants\r\nbecause of their cruelty toward some nuns. A strange gloom pervades\r\nthe place, the cathedral bells ring of themselves, and flaming signs\r\nappear on the church doors, till after much penance the citizens are\r\nallowed to return and the invading hosts from eternity withdraw. In\r\none story,[176] Mrs. Oliphant gives her ideas of heaven, as a place of\r\nlight, of rest, of joy, of service, where the great angel Pain helps\r\nthe souls to wisdom. In a counter-picture,[177] she shows hell, the\r\nworld of the unhappy dead, where are cruelty, selfishness, suffering,\r\na world filled with tears that drip from earth. Yet it is a hell as\r\nwell-regulated, as thoroughly disciplined as a German municipality,\r\nwith various punishments,--the most terrible being a lecture platform\r\nfrom which are delivered eternal addresses.\r\n\r\n      [173] _The Open Door._\r\n\r\n      [174] _The Portrait._\r\n\r\n      [175] _Old Lady Mary._\r\n\r\n      [176] _The Little Pilgrim in the Unseen._\r\n\r\n      [177] _The Land of Darkness._\r\n\r\nThese would-be-realistic stories of heaven and hell somehow leave the\r\nreader cold, after Dante and Milton, however much one may feel the\r\nsincerity of the authors. Heaven and hell are such vast provinces that\r\none cannot chart them in imagination sufficiently to grasp somebody\r\nelse's concept in story.\r\n\r\nOther stories of life after death, given from the spirit-angle rather\r\nthan from the mortal point of view as in most ghost stories, are among\r\nthe recent types of supernaturalism. Alice Brown has several stories of\r\nthe kind, in one showing a woman who comes to tell her friend not to be\r\nafraid of dying, because There is much like Here, and another symbolic\r\nof the power of love to come back even from the pit of blackness after\r\ndeath. Olivia Howard Dunbar's _The Shell of Sense_ gives the psychosis\r\nof a woman who cannot go to heaven because she is jealous of her\r\nhusband. She _sees_ the form of the wind, _hears_ the roses open in the\r\ngarden, and senses many things unknown to human beings, yet is actuated\r\nby very human motives. Katherine Butler[178] suggests that death must\r\nbe a painless process and the after life much like mortality, since\r\nthe man doesn't realize that he is dead but attempts to go about his\r\naffairs as usual.\r\n\r\n      [178] In _In No Strange Land._\r\n\r\nThe symbolic treatment of the theme of life after death is more\r\neffective and shows more literary art than the conventional pictures\r\nof Mrs. Ward's and Mrs. Oliphant's. No human vocabulary is able to\r\ndescribe immortality of glory or despair, hence it is more effective\r\nmerely to suggest the thought by allegory or symbolism. Hawthorne\r\ngives us a symbolic morality in _The Celestial Railroad_, where he\r\npictures the road between heaven and hell, drawing on Bunyan's imagery\r\nto describe the landscape and characters. Apollyon is engineer and\r\nemits realistic blasts of smoke. Eugene Field[179] tells of a mother\r\njust entering heaven who asks an angel where she may find her little\r\nbaby, dead long ago, to whom the angel whispers that she is the babe,\r\ngrown to maturity in Paradise. Julian Hawthorne's _Lovers in Heaven_\r\nis a symbolic picture of the after life, where a man just dead goes\r\nin search of the beloved he lost long before. He sees her on the far\r\nslope of a heavenly hill, but before he can reach her the devil appears\r\nto him in his own double, \"the Satan of mine own self, the part of me\r\nwherein God had no share.\" This is a quite modern concept of diabolism.\r\nBut love struggles to save him, and he resists his evil self.\r\n\r\n      [179] In _The Mother in Paradise_.\r\n\r\n_Ahrinziman_, by Anita Silvani, shows lurid pictures of the world to\r\ncome. In the Inferno of the Dark Star the soul sees the attendant genii\r\nof his life, each symbolizing some passion of his nature. There are\r\nhorrible astral birds and beasts and combinations unknown to mortal\r\nbiology, while vultures hover overhead and a foul astral odor fills\r\nthe air. The spirits are of peculiar substance, for they fight and\r\nslay each other, some being torn to pieces. The soul is supposed to\r\nprogress toward the Silver and later the Golden Star. Marie Corelli's\r\n_Romance of Two Worlds_ is a queer production, preaching the doctrine\r\nof psychical electricity, which is to be a sort of wonder-working\r\nmagician, and in other novels she gives theories of radio-activity, a\r\ntheosophical cure-all for this world and the next.\r\n\r\n_A Vision of Judgment_, by H. G. Wells, is a satire on man's judgment\r\nof sin and character and of destiny after death, showing the pettiness\r\nand folly of Ahab, proud of his sins, and the hypocrisy of a so-called\r\nsaint, conceited over his self-torture. \"At last the two sat side\r\nby side, stark of all illusions, in the shadow of the robe of God's\r\ncharity, like brothers.\" The picture of God and the throne vanish\r\nand they behold a land austere and beautiful, with the enlightened\r\nsouls of men in clean bodies all about him. This symbolic allegory\r\nsetting forth the shallowness of human judgment as set against God's\r\nclarity of vision and charity of wisdom is like Oscar Wilde's _The\r\nHouse of Judgment_, a terrible piece of symbolism expressed in a few\r\nwords. A soul who has been altogether evil comes at last before God\r\nto be judged. God speaks to him of his vileness, his cruelty, his\r\nselfishness, to all of which the soul makes confession of guilt.\r\n\r\n  And God, closing the book of the man's Life, said, \"Surely I will\r\n  send thee into Hell. Even unto Hell will I send thee.\"\r\n\r\n  And the man cried out, \"Thou canst not!\"\r\n\r\n  And God said to the man, \"Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell,\r\n  and for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Because in Hell I have always lived,\" answered the man.\r\n\r\n  And there was silence in the house of judgment.\r\n\r\n  And after a space God spake and said to the man, \"Seeing that I may\r\n  not send thee into Hell, I will send thee into Heaven. Surely unto\r\n  Heaven I will send thee.\"\r\n\r\n  And the man cried out, \"Thou canst not!\"\r\n\r\n  And God said to the man, \"Wherefore can I not send thee unto\r\n  Heaven, and for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Because, never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it!\"\r\n  answered the man.\r\n\r\n  And there was silence in the house of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a man's thoughts make his heaven or his hell is brought\r\nout in a recent book, _The Case of John Smith_, by Elizabeth Bisland,\r\nwhere the central character receives a revelation while working at his\r\ntypewriter one day. The message says, \"Oh, Peevish and Perverse! How\r\nknow you that you have not died elsewhere and that this is not the\r\nHeaven which there you dreamed? How know you that your Hell may not lie\r\nonly in not recognizing this as Heaven?\"\r\n\r\nIn many recent examples of allegory and symbolism we get suggestive\r\nimpressions of the other life, of the soul's realities. Some of these\r\nhave the inevitable words, the fatal phrases that seem to penetrate\r\ninto the real heaven and hell for us. The most remarkable instance\r\nof symbolic treatment of the after-life is in _Souls on Fifth_, by\r\nGranville Barker, where the spirits of the dead are represented as\r\nunable to rise above the level of the ideals they had held in life, and\r\ndrift endlessly up and down the Avenue, some in the form of tarnished\r\ngilt, some with white plague spots of cowardice, or blisters of\r\nslanderous thoughts, some horny with selfishness, some with lines of\r\nsecret cruelty. There are few squares but mostly irregular shapes of\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nThe purely humorous treatment of life after death, the comic pictures\r\nof heaven and hell, are of a piece with the humorous treatment of other\r\nphases of supernaturalism, and are distinctly modern. The flippant way\r\nin which sacred subjects are handled is a far cry from the heaven and\r\nhell of Dante and Milton. Modern writers slap the devil on the back,\r\nmake fun of the archangels and appeal to the ridiculous in one-time\r\nsacred situations, with a freedom that would have made the Puritans\r\ngasp. For instance, St. Peter has been the butt of so many jokes that\r\nhe is really hackneyed.\r\n\r\nThe Flying Dutchman, whom Brander Matthews introduces in his _Primer of\r\nImaginary Geography_, and who says that the Wandering Jew is the only\r\nperson he can have any satisfactory chats with now, speaks of knowing\r\nCharon, \"who keeps the ferry across the Styx. I met him last month and\r\nhe was very proud of his new electric launch with its storage battery.\"\r\nHe says that hell is now lighted by electricity and that Pluto has put\r\nin all the modern improvements. John Kendrick Bangs, in his _House-boat\r\non the Styx_, brings together the shades of many illustrious persons;\r\nQueen Elizabeth, Walter Raleigh, Socrates, Xantippe, Captain Kidd, and\r\nmany others. From them we get pictures of the life after death and of\r\ntheir characteristic attitudes toward it and each other. He continues\r\nthe situation in _The Pursuit of the House-boat_, as the redoubtable\r\nCaptain Kidd makes off with the ship and the ladies, leaving all the\r\nmen behind. But they follow the bold buccaneer and after exciting\r\nadventures reaching from the Styx to Paris, they recapture the fair.\r\nCarolyn Wells has recently given us a Styx River Anthology. In modern\r\nstories we visit the comic devil on his native heath, see him in\r\nhis own home town, as in previous chapters we discussed him in his\r\nappearances on earth. Kipling's _The Last of the Stories_ shows us the\r\nHades of literary endeavor, the limbo of lost characters, presided over\r\nby a large and luminous devil of fluent tongue. Kipling recognizes many\r\npersons from fiction, and sees various tortures in process. All do\r\nobeisance to the shade of Rabelais, the Master. Kipling is terrified by\r\nthe characters he himself has brought into being and begs to hide his\r\nface from them. F. Marion Crawford gives us another glimpse of literary\r\neternity,[180] where the spirits of learned personages meet and\r\ndiscuss life. A recent poem describes a meeting and dialogue in Hades\r\nbetween Chaucer and Cressida.\r\n\r\n      [180] In _Among the Immortals_.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly Bernard Shaw who would be most liable to prosecution by\r\nthe devil for lèse-majesté, for in _Man and Superman_, Mine Host of\r\nthe Pit is represented as an affable gentleman who tries to make hell\r\nattractive to his guests, and exercises not the least constraint on\r\ntheir movements. They are free to leave him and go to heaven if they\r\nlike,--he only warns them that they will find it tiresome. He converses\r\nwith Don Juan and a couple of other blasé mortals, uttering Shavian\r\niconoclasms with an air of courteous boredom. He is very different from\r\nthe sinister personage of conventional fiction.\r\n\r\nMark Twain has given humorous views of heaven in his _Extract from\r\nCaptain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven_. A bluff, hearty old salt finds\r\nthe celestial regions very different from the traditional descriptions\r\nof them. The heavenly citizens are a polite set, wishful for him to do\r\nwhat he likes, yet he tires of the things he thought paradise consisted\r\nof, lays aside his harp and crown, and takes his wings off for greater\r\nease. He finds his pleasures in the meeting of an occasional patriarch,\r\nor prophet, and the excitement of the entry of a converted bartender\r\nfrom Jersey City. He changes his views on many points, saying for\r\ninstance, \"I begin to see a man's got to be in his own heaven to be\r\nhappy,\" and again, \"Happiness ain't a thing in itself,--it's only a\r\ncontrast with something that ain't pleasant.\" Again Sandy, his friend,\r\nsays, \"I wish there was something _in_ that miserable Spiritualism so\r\nwe could send the folks word about it.\"\r\n\r\nSomething of the same combination of humor and earnestness is found in\r\nNicholas Vachell Lindsay's poem, _General William Booth Enters into\r\nHeaven_.\r\n\r\n   \"Booth led boldly with his big bass drum,\r\n    _Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?_\r\n    The saints smiled gravely as they said, 'He's come.'\r\n    _Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?_\r\n        (Bass drums)\r\n    Walking lepers followed, rank on rank,\r\n    Lurching bravos from the ditches dank,\r\n    Drabs from the alley-ways and drug-fiends pale\r\n    Minds still passion-ridden, soul-power frail!\r\n    Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath,\r\n    Unwashed legions with the ways of death,--\r\n    _Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?_\r\n\r\n        (Reverently sung--no instruments)\r\n    And while Booth halted by the curb for prayer\r\n    He saw his Master through the flag-filled air.\r\n    Christ came gently with a robe and crown\r\n    For Booth the soldier, while the crowd knelt down.\r\n    He saw King Jesus--they were face to face--\r\n    And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.\r\n    _Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?_\"\r\n\r\nThis combination of realism with idealism, of homely details with\r\ncelestial symbolism, is also seen in another recent poem, _The Man with\r\nthe Pigeons_, by William Rose Benet, who shows us two pictures, the\r\nfirst of a tramp in Madison Square Garden, who loves the pigeons and\r\nhas them ever clustering around him in devotion. The next is of heaven,\r\nwith the celestial gardens, where among the goldhaired angels the old\r\ntramp stands at home, still wearing his rusty shoes and battered derby\r\nhat. The quaint commingling of fancy and fact reminds us of Hannele's\r\ndreams of heaven, in Hauptmann's _Hannele_, where the schoolmaster is\r\nconfused with the angels, and heaven and the sordid little room are\r\nsomehow united.\r\n\r\nH. G. Wells, in _A Wonderful Visit_ shows us another side of the\r\npicture, for he draws an angel down and lets him tell the citizens\r\nof the earth of the land he comes from. I make no attempt in this\r\ndiscussion to decide concerning the personality of angels, whether\r\nthey are the spirits of the just made perfect or pre-Adamite creatures\r\nthat never were and never could be man. For the present purpose, they\r\nare simply angels. This book of Wells's is an example of the satiric\r\ntreatment of heaven and earth that constitutes a special point of\r\nimportance in the modern supernaturalism. It is a social satire, and\r\na burlesque on the formal and insincere manifestations of religion.\r\nA vicar takes a pot shot at what he supposes is a rare bird, seeing\r\na rainbow flash in the sky,--but instead, an angel comes tumbling\r\ndown with a broken wing. This thrusts him upon the vicar as a guest\r\nfor some time, and introduces complications in the village life. The\r\nparishioners do not believe in angels save in stained glass windows\r\nor in church on Sunday, and they make life difficult for the vicar\r\nand his guest. The angel shows a human sense of humor, that quaint\r\nphilosophy of the incongruous which is the basis of all true humor,\r\nand his naïve comments on earthly conventions, his smiling wonder at\r\nthe popular misconceptions in regard to his heaven--to which he is\r\nsurprised to learn that mortals are thought to go, since he says he has\r\nnever seen any there--make him a lovable character. But village custom\r\ncompels him to fold his shining wings under a coat till he looks like a\r\nhunch-back, put boots on so that he \"has hoofs like a hippogrif,\" as he\r\nplaintively says to the vicar, and he finds conformity to convention a\r\npainful process. The novel ends sadly, symbolizing the world's stupid\r\nharshness, for the angel is sent away from the village as unworthy to\r\nlive among the people, and his heart is almost broken.\r\n\r\nThe same type of humor and satire may be found in James Stephens's\r\n_The Demi-Gods_, and in Anatole France's, _The Revolt of the Angels_.\r\nStephens's novel contains an insert of a short story of heaven\r\npreviously published, which depicts a preliminary skirmish in heaven\r\nover a coin a corpse has had left in his hand and has taken to eternity\r\nwith him. In each novel several angels come tumbling down from\r\nheaven and take up earthly life as they find it, engaging in affairs\r\nnot considered angelic. Stephens, in addition to the two fighting\r\ncelestials, gives us an archangel, a seraph, and a cherub. There is\r\nin both stories a certain embarrassment over clothes, the fallen ones\r\narriving in a state of nudity. The necessity for donning earthly\r\ngarments, the removal of the wings, and the adaptation to human life\r\nfurnish complication and interest, with the added feminine element,\r\nthough Stephens's novel is not marred by the unclean imaginings of\r\nAnatole France.\r\n\r\nThe revolters in the French novel take up Parisian life, while\r\nStephens's angelic trio join an itinerant tinker and his daughter\r\nwho are journeying aimlessly about, accompanied by a cart and a\r\nsad-eyed philosopher, an ass. They engage in activities and joys not\r\nconventionally archangelic, such as smoking corn-cob pipes, eating cold\r\npotatoes, and, when necessary, stealing the potatoes. The contrasts\r\nbetween heavenly ideas and Irish tramp life are inimitable. At last\r\nwhen the three, having decided to go back to heaven, don their wings\r\nand crowns and say good-bye, the cherub turns back for one more word\r\nof farewell with Mary. Seeing her tears over his going, he tears his\r\nshining wings to shreds and casts them from him, electing to stay on\r\nearth with the tinker's cart, for the sake of love. It is really quite\r\na demi-god-like thing to do.\r\n\r\nUnlike France's book, which is a blasting satire on religion, these\r\ntwo English novels are amusing, with a certain measure of satire, yet\r\nwith a whimsicality that does not antagonize. France's angels remain on\r\nearth and become more corrupt than men, and Wells's wonderful visitor\r\nis banished from the village as an undesirable alien. Stephens's\r\narchangel and seraph go back to heaven after their vacation, while\r\nthe cherub turns his back on immortal glory rather than break a\r\nwoman's heart. In all three of these books we notice the same leveling\r\ntendency shown in characterization of the angels that we have observed\r\nheretofore in the case of ghosts and devils, werewolves, and witches.\r\nThe angels are human, with charming personality and a piquant sense\r\nof humor, whose attempts to understand mortal conventions reveal the\r\nessential absurdity of earthly ideas in many instances. The three\r\ntaken together constitute an interesting case of literary parallelism\r\nand it would be gratifying to discover whether France was influenced\r\nby Wells and Stephens, or Stephens by Wells and France,--but in any\r\nevent Wells can prove a clear alibi as to imitation, since his novel\r\nappeared a number of years before the others. The possible inspiration\r\nfor all of these in Byron's _Heaven and Earth_ suggests an interesting\r\ninvestigation. A more recent story, _The Ticket-of-Leave Angel_,\r\nbrings an angel down to a New York apartment, where he has peculiar\r\nexperiences and illustrates a new type of angelic psychology. The\r\ntendency to satirize immortality has crept even into poetry, for in a\r\nrecent volume by Rupert Brooke there are several satiric studies. One,\r\nentitled _On Certain Proceedings of the Psychical Research Society_,\r\nridicules the idea that spirits would return to earth to deliver the\r\ntrivial messages attributed to them, and another, _Heaven_, is a\r\nvitriolic thrust at the hope of a better life after death, sneering at\r\nit with unpleasant imagery.\r\n\r\nOne of the recent instances of satiric pictures of the hereafter is\r\nLord Dunsany's _The Glittering Gate_, a one-act drama, where Bill\r\nand Jim, two burglars, crack the gate of heaven to get in. Sardonic\r\nlaughter sounds while they are engaged in the effort to effect an\r\nentrance, and wondering what heaven will be like. Bill thinks that his\r\nmother will be there.\r\n\r\n  \"I don't know if they want a good mother in there who would be kind\r\n  to the angels and sit and smile at them when they sing, and soothe\r\n  them if they were cross. (Suddenly) Jim, they won't have brought me\r\n  up against her, will they?\"\r\n\r\n  Jim: \"It would be just like them to. Very like them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the glittering gate of heaven swings open and the two toughs enter\r\neagerly, they find nothing--absolutely nothing but empty space, and the\r\nsardonic laughter sounds in their ears. Bill cries out, \"It is just\r\nlike them! Very like them\"!\r\n\r\nWas not this suggested by Rupert Brooke's poem, _Failure_?\r\n\r\nIn the stories treating satirically or humorously of the future life we\r\nfind the purpose in reality to be to image this life by illustration\r\nof the other. Eternity is described in order that we may understand\r\ntime a little better. Angels and devils are made like men, to show\r\nmortal potentialities either way. The absurdities of mankind are\r\nillustrated as seen by angel eyes, the follies as satirized by devils.\r\nThe tendency now is to treat supernatural life humorously, satirically\r\nor symbolically, rather than with the conventional methods of the past.\r\nCommonplace treatment of great subjects is liable to be unsatisfactory,\r\nand any serious treatment, other than symbolically simple, of heaven or\r\nhell seems flat after Dante and Milton.\r\n\r\nIn considering these various types of stories dealing with supernatural\r\nlife, whether continued beyond the mortal span on earth, renewed by\r\nreincarnation, or taken up in another world after death, we find that\r\nseveral facts seem to appear with reference to the type chosen for\r\ntreatment by men as distinct from women, and _vice versa_. So far as my\r\nsearch has gone, I have found no instance in English literature where a\r\nwoman has used either the motif of the Wandering Jew or the Elixir of\r\nLife. I do not say that no such instances exist, but I have not found\r\nthem. Carmen Sylva is the only woman I know of at all who has taken up\r\nthe characterization of the Wandering Jew. On the other hand, women\r\nwrite often of heaven, most of the stories of conventional ideas of\r\nheaven being by women. Where men have pictured heaven or hell they have\r\ndone it for the most part humorously, satirically or symbolically. They\r\nseem to curve round the subject rather than to approach it directly.\r\nYet where it is a question of continuing life here in this world, by\r\nmeans of an elixir or other method, or as an ever-living being like the\r\nJew, men have used the theme frequently. Since fiction does reflect\r\nour thought-life and our individual as well as racial preferences, the\r\nconclusions that might be drawn, if one were sure of their basis, would\r\nbe interesting. Can it be that men are more deeply interested in this\r\nlife on earth and cling to it in thought more tenaciously than women,\r\nand that women are more truly citizens of the other world? Are men\r\nskeptical of the existence of any but a satiric or symbolic heaven, or\r\nmerely doubtful of reaching there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Supernatural in Folk-Tales\r\n\r\n\r\nThe folk-tale is one of the new fashions in fiction. True, folk-lore\r\nhas long constituted an important element of literature, constantly\r\nrecurring in poetry, particularly in the ballad, in the drama, the\r\nnovel, and short story. Yet it has been in solution. It has not been\r\nthought important enough to merit consideration for its own sake, but\r\nhas been rather apologized for, covered up with other materials, so\r\nthat its presence is scarcely recognized. Now, however, as Professor\r\nKittredge says, folk-lore is no longer on the defensive, which fact\r\nis evident in fiction as elsewhere. Scholars of our day are eagerly\r\nhunting down the various forms of folk-lore to preserve them in\r\nliterature before they vanish completely, and learned societies\r\nare recording with care the myths and legends and superstitions of\r\npeasants. Many volumes have appeared giving in literary form the\r\nfictions of various races and tribes, and comparative folk-lore is\r\nfound to be an engrossing science.\r\n\r\nThe supernatural forms a large element of folk-literature. The\r\ntraditions and stories that come down to us from the childhood of\r\nany race are like the stories that children delight in, tales of the\r\nmarvelous, of the impossible, of magic and wonder. Folk-literature\r\nrecks little of realism. It revels in the romantic, the mystic. Tales\r\nof gods and demi-gods, of giants and demons, of fairy-folk, of animals\r\nendowed with human powers of speech and cunning, of supernatural flora\r\nas well as fauna, of ghosts, devils, of saints, and miracles, are the\r\nframe-work of such fiction. English literature is especially rich in\r\nthese collections, for not only are the sections of English-speaking\r\ncountries themselves fortunate fields for supernatural folk-tales,\r\nbut the English, being a race of colonizers, have gone far in many\r\nlands and from the distant corners of the earth have written down the\r\nlegends of many tribes and nations. This discussion does not take into\r\nconsideration primarily folk-tales translated from other languages, but\r\ndeals only with those appearing in English, though, of course, in many\r\ncases, they are transcripts from the spoken dialects of other people.\r\nBut it is for their appearance as English fiction, not for their value\r\nas folk-lore, that they are taken up here.\r\n\r\nWherever in fiction the life of the peasant class is definitely\r\ntreated, there is likely to be found a good deal of folk-lore in the\r\nform of superstitions, taboos, racial traditions of the supernatural.\r\nThis is present to a marked degree in the stories of Sir Walter Scott,\r\nand in fact one might write a volume on the supernatural in Scott's\r\nwork alone. For example, we have Oriental magic and wonder,[181]\r\nsupernatural vision,[182] superhuman foreknowledge,[183] unearthly\r\n\"stirs,\"[184] the White Lady of Avenel,[185] the bahrgeist,[186]\r\nbesides his use of diabolism, witchcraft, and so forth already\r\ndiscussed. Thomas Hardy's work, relating as it does almost wholly to\r\nrustic life, is rich in superstitions and traditions of the peasants.\r\n_The Withered Arm_ gives a gruesome account of a woman's attempt to\r\ncure her affliction by touching her arm to the corpse of a man who\r\nhas been hanged, the complicating horror being furnished by the fact\r\nthat the youth is her husband's secret son. He gives a story[187] of\r\na supernatural coach that heralds certain events in the family life,\r\ncharms for securing love as for making refractory butter come when the\r\nchurn is bewitched, and so forth. Similar elements occur in others of\r\nhis novels and stories. Eden Phillpotts' fiction[188] shows a large\r\nadmixture of the folk-supernaturalism of the Dartmoor peasants, as do\r\n_Lorna Doone_, _Wuthering Heights_ and numberless other novels and\r\nstories of other sections. There are guild superstitions reflected in\r\nthe work of various writers of the sea, as in W. W. Jacobs' stories,\r\nfor instance, tales of mining life, and so on.\r\n\r\n      [181] In _The Talisman_.\r\n\r\n      [182] In _My Aunt Margaret's Mirror_.\r\n\r\n      [183] In _The Two Drovers_.\r\n\r\n      [184] In _Woodstock_.\r\n\r\n      [185] In _The Monastery_.\r\n\r\n      [186] In _The Betrothed_.\r\n\r\n      [187] In _Tess_.\r\n\r\n      [188] _Children of the Mist_, _The Witch_, and others.\r\n\r\nAmerican fiction is equally rich in such material. Stories of the\r\nSouth, showing life in contact with the negroes, reveal it to a marked\r\ndegree, as in the work of Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler Harris,\r\nRuth McEnery Stuart, Will Allen Dromgoole, and others. The Creole\r\nsense of the supernatural appears in George W. Cable's novels and\r\nstories, the mountain superstitions in those of John Fox, Jr., and\r\nCharles Egbert Craddock, those of New England in Mary Wilkins Freeman,\r\nAlice Brown, and their followers, the Indian traditions in Helen Hunt\r\nJackson, J. Fenimore Cooper, the Dutch supernaturalism in Washington\r\nIrving, who also gives us the legendry of Spain in his tales of the\r\nAlhambra. Thomas A. Janvier has recreated antique Mexico for us in his\r\nstories of ghosts and saints, of devils and miracles.\r\n\r\nIn most fiction that represents truly the life of simple people there\r\nwill be found a certain amount of superstition which is inherent in\r\npractically every soul. There is no one of us but has his ideas of\r\nfate, of luck, of taboo. We are so used to these elements in life that\r\nwe scarcely pay heed to them in fiction, yet a brief glance at books\r\nwill recall their frequent appearance. They color poetry to a marked\r\ndegree. In fact, without the sense of the marvelous, the unreal, the\r\nwonderful, the magical, what would poetry mean to us? So we should\r\nfeel a keen loss in our fiction if all the vague elements of the\r\nsupernatural were effaced. Absolute realism is the last thing we desire.\r\n\r\nNow the folk-tale, told frankly as such, with no apology for its\r\nunreality, no attempt to make of it merely an allegory or vehicle\r\nfor teaching moral truth, has taken its place in our literature.\r\nThe science of ethnology has brought a wider interest in the oral\r\nheritage of the past, linking it to our life of the present. And the\r\nmultiplication of volumes recording stories of symbolic phenomena\r\nof nature, of gods, demi-gods, and heroes, of supernormal animals\r\nand plants, of fairies, banshees, bogles, giants, saints, miracles,\r\nand what-not make it possible to compare the widely disseminated\r\nstories, the variants and contrasting types of folk-supernaturalism.\r\nBut my purpose in this discussion is to show the presence of the\r\nfolk-supernaturalism in literature, in prose fiction particularly.\r\nThere is no science more fascinating than comparative folk-lore and no\r\nlanguage affords so many original examples of oral literature as the\r\nEnglish. As we study its influence on fiction and poetry, we feel the\r\ntruth of what Tylor says[189]:\r\n\r\n  Little by little, in what seems the most spontaneous fiction, a\r\n  more comprehensive study of the sources of poetry and romance\r\n  begins to disclose a cause for each fancy, a story of inherited\r\n  materials from which each province of the poet's land has been\r\n  shaped and built over and peopled.\r\n\r\n      [189] In _Primitive Culture_, vol. i., page 273.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic Revival, the renascence of wonder in Ireland, has done more\r\nthan anything else to awaken modern love for antiquity, to bring over\r\ninto literature the legends of gods and men\r\n\r\n   \"Beyond the misty space\r\n    Of twice a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the movement concerns itself more with poetry and the drama than\r\nwith prose,--Ireland has been likened to \"a nest of singing birds,\"\r\nthough the voices of some have been sadly silenced of late--yet fiction\r\nhas felt its influence as well. The land of the immortals glooms and\r\ngleams again for us in storied vision, and the ancient past yields up\r\nto us its magic, its laughter, its tears. These romances are written,\r\nnot in pedestrian prose as ordinary folk-tales, but with a bardic\r\nbeauty that gives to style the lifting wings of verse. Each fact and\r\nfigure is expressed in poetic symbols, which Yeats calls \"streams of\r\npassion poured about concrete forms.\" A sense of ancient, divine powers\r\nis in every bush and bog, every lake and valley. Ireland has enriched\r\nuniversal fancy and the effect on literature will perhaps never be lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of folk-loristic supernaturalism\r\nis that concerned with nature. The primitive mind needs no scientific\r\nproof for theories of causation, since, given a belief in gods, it can\r\nmanage the rest for itself. With the Celts there is ever a feeling\r\nof nature as a mighty personality. Every aspect, every phase of her\r\npower is endowed with life and temperament. Celtic pantheism saw in\r\nevery form a spirit, in every spring or cloud or hill-top, in every\r\nbird or blossom some unearthly divinity of being. A primrose is vastly\r\nmore than a yellow primrose, but one of \"the dear golden folk\"; the\r\nhawthorn is the barking of hounds, leek is the tear of a fair woman,\r\nand so on, which poetic speech bears a likeness to the Icelandic court\r\npoetry. This figurative sense suggests \"an _after-thought_ of the old\r\nnature-worship lingering yet about the fjords and glens where Druidism\r\nnever was quite overcome by Christianity.\" It lends to the Celtic\r\nfolk-tales their wild, unearthly beauty, their passionate poetry and\r\nmystic symbolism akin to the classic mythology and such as we find in\r\nno other folk-literature of the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the stories of Lady Gregory, John Synge, Yeats, Lady Wilde, and\r\nvarious other chroniclers of Celtic legendry, we find explanations\r\nof many phenomena, accounts of diverse occurrences. Lady Wilde[190]\r\n(Speranza) tells of natural appearances, such as a great chasm\r\nwhich was opened to swallow a man who incurred the anger of God by\r\nchallenging Him to combat for destroying his crops. A supernatural\r\nwhirlwind caught up the blasphemer and hurled him into the chasm that\r\nyawned to receive him. Many of the aspects of nature are attributed\r\nto the activities of giants, and later of demons; as the piling up of\r\ncyclopean walls, massive breast-works of earth, or gigantic masses of\r\nrocks said to be the work of playful or irate giants. The titans were\r\nfrolicsome and delighted in feats to show off. There is a large body\r\nof legends of diabolized nature, as the changing of the landscape by\r\ndemons, the sulphurizing of springs, and the cursing of localities.\r\n\r\n      [190] In _Ancient Legends and Superstitions of Ireland_.\r\n\r\nMany other aspects of nature are made the basis for supernatural\r\nfolk-tales too numerous to mention. Stories of the enchanted bird,\r\nmusic, and water appear in various forms, and the droll-tellers of\r\nthe Cornish country tell many stories of the weird associated with\r\nout-of-doors. The Celtic superstitions and tales have lived on through\r\nsuccessive invasions and through many centuries have been told beside\r\nthe peat fire. They have been preserved as an oral heritage or else in\r\nalmost illegible manuscripts in antique libraries, from which they are\r\ntaken to be put into literature by the Celtic patriots of letters. The\r\nsense of terror and of awe, a belief in the darker powers, as well as\r\nan all-enveloping feeling of beauty is a heritage of the Celtic mind.\r\nIt is interesting to note the obstinacy of these pantheistic, druidic\r\nstories in the face of Irish Catholicism. In many other bodies of\r\nfolk-supernaturalism in English we have similar legends of nature, as\r\nin the Hawaiian, the Indian, African, Canadian, Mexican stories, and\r\nelsewhere. But the material is so voluminous that one can do no more\r\nthan suggest the field.\r\n\r\nCertain forces of nature are given supernatural power in drama and\r\nfiction, as the sea that is an awful, brooding Fate, in Synge's\r\ndrama, or the wind and the flame in Algernon Blackwood's story, _The\r\nRegeneration of Lord Ernie_, or the goblin trees in another of his\r\ntales, that signify diabolic spirits, or the trees[191] that have a\r\nstrange, compelling power over men, drawing them, going out bodily to\r\nmeet them, luring them to destruction. Blackwood has stressed this\r\nform of supernaturalism to a marked degree. In _Sand_ he shows desert\r\nincantations that embody majestic forces, evocations of ancient deities\r\nthat bring the Sphynx to life, and other sinister powers. He takes\r\nthe folk-loristic aspects of nature and makes them live, personifying\r\nthe forces of out-door life as mythology did. The trees, the sand,\r\nthe fire, the snow, the wind, the stream, the sea are all alive, with\r\npersonality, with emotion, and definite being. His trees are more\r\nawesome than the woods of Dunsinane, for they actually do move upon\r\ntheir foe. In _The Sea Fit_ he contends that the gods are not dead, but\r\nmerely withdrawn, that one true worshiper can call them back to earth,\r\nespecially the sea-gods. The sea comes in power for the man with the\r\nViking soul and takes him to itself. His going is symbolic.\r\n\r\n  Uttering the singing sound of falling waters, he bent forward,\r\n  turned. The next instant, curving over like a falling wave he swept\r\n  along the glistening surface of the sands and was gone. In fluid\r\n  form, wave-like, his being slipped away into the Being of the Sea.\r\n\r\n      [191] In _The Man Whom the Trees Loved_.\r\n\r\nThe uncanny potentialities of fire are revealed[192] where the internal\r\nflame breaks out of itself, the inner fire that burns in the heart\r\nof the earth and in men's hearts. The artist trying to paint a great\r\npicture of the Fire-worshiper is consumed by an intense, rapturous\r\nfever, and as he dies his face is like a white flame. The snow appears\r\nembodied as a luring woman.[193] She tries to draw a man to his\r\ndeath, with dæmonic charm, seen as a lovely woman, but a snow demon.\r\nBlackwood shows the curious combination of the soul of a dead woman\r\nwith the spirit of a place,[194] where a man is ejected by his own\r\nestate, turned out bodily as well as psychically, because he has become\r\nout of harmony with the locale. Nature here is sentient, emotional,\r\npossessing a child, expressing through her lips and hands a message of\r\nmenace and warning. The moon is given diabolic power in one of Barry\r\nPain's stories, and the maelstrom described by Poe has a sinister, more\r\nthan human, power. August Stramm, the German dramatist, has given an\r\nuncanny force to the moor in one of his plays, making it the principal\r\ncharacter as well as the setting for the action. This embodiment of\r\nnature's phases and phenomena as terrible powers goes back to ancient\r\nmythology with a revivifying influence.\r\n\r\n      [192] In _The Heath Fire_.\r\n\r\n      [193] In _The Glamor of the Snow_.\r\n\r\n      [194] In _The Temptation of the Clay_.\r\n\r\nThe supernatural beast-tale has always been a beloved form, Æsop's\r\nfables, the beast-cycles of medievalism, Reynard the Fox, the German\r\nReinecke Fuchs, all show how fond humanity is of the story that endows\r\nanimals with human powers. Naturally one thinks of Kipling's _Jungle\r\nTales_ and Joel Chandler Harris' _Uncle Remus_ stories as the best\r\nmodern examples, and these are so well known as to need but mention.\r\nSimilar beast-cycles are found in the folk-fiction of other countries.\r\nOf course, it is understood that the _Uncle Remus_ stories are not\r\nnative to America, but were brought from Africa by the slaves and\r\nhanded down through generations in the form in which Harris heard them\r\nby the cabin firesides in his boyhood. They are not \"cooked\" or edited\r\nany more than he could help, he tells us, but given in the dialectic\r\nform in which they came to him. There are various tales similar to this\r\nseries, as Kaffir tales, collected by Theal, Amazonian tortoise myths\r\nbrought together by Charles F. Hart, and _Reynard, the Fox in South\r\nAfrica_, by W. H. I. Bleek. J. W. Powell in his investigations for the\r\nSmithsonian Institute found legends among the Indians that led him to\r\nbelieve the _Uncle Remus_ stories were originally learned from the red\r\nmen, but Harris thought there was no basis for such theory. _Anansi\r\nStories_, by Mary Pamela Milne-Horne, includes animal tales of the\r\nAfrican type. Anansi is a mysterious being, a supernatural old man like\r\na Scandinavian troll or English lubber-fiend, who plays tricks like\r\nthose of the fox and like the jackal in Hindu stories. He is a spider\r\nas well as a man and can assume either shape at will.\r\n\r\nIn primitive races and in the childhood of peoples there is the same\r\nelement of close association between man and the animals that one\r\nfinds in child-life. An animal is often nearer and dearer to a child\r\nthan is a human being, as in crude races man is more like the animals,\r\ncandid, careless, unreflecting. His sensations and emotions are simple,\r\nhunger, love, hate, fear. Animals, in turn, are lifted nearer the human\r\nin man's thinking, and are given human attributes in folk-lore which\r\nbridges the gulf that civilization has tended to fix between man and\r\nanimals, and gives one more of a sense of the social union that Burns\r\nlonged for. There is in these stories of whatever country a naïveté\r\nreflecting the childhood of the race and of the world, a primitive\r\nsimplicity in dealing with the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThe folk-fiction of each country gives stories of the animals common\r\nto that section. In tropic countries we have stories of supernatural\r\nsnakes, who appear in various forms, as were-snakes, shall we say?\r\nby turns reptiles and men, who marry mortal women, or as diabolic\r\ncreatures that, like the devil, lose their divinity and become evil\r\npowers. We also see in the tropics elephants, lions, tigers, baboons,\r\ngorillas, and so forth, as well as certain insects, while in colder\r\nclimes we have the fox, the wolf, the bear, and their confrères. In\r\nisland countries we find a large element of the supernatural associated\r\nwith fishes and sea-animals. Hawaiian stories recount adventures of\r\nmagic beings born of sharks and women, who are themselves, by turns,\r\nhuman beings living a normal human life, and sharks, devouring men\r\nand women. Several of Eugene Field's stories are drawn from Hawaiian\r\nfolk-supernaturalism, as _The Eel-king_, and _The Moon Lady_.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic stories of Fiona McLeod show the supernatural relation\r\nexisting between mortals and seals. The seals may wed human beings and\r\ntheir children are beings without souls, who may be either mortal or\r\nanimal. The power of enchantment exercised by the creatures of the sea\r\nmay turn men and women into sea-beasts, forever to lose their souls.\r\nThis may be compared with _The Pagan Seal-Wife_, by Eugene Field, Hans\r\nChristian Andersen's sad story of the little mermaid, and _The Forsaken\r\nMerman_, by Matthew Arnold. Fiona McLeod tells the story of the Dark\r\nNameless One, a nun who became the prey of a seal and was cursed with\r\nthe penalty of living under the sea to weave fatal enchantments.\r\nThe mermaids, the kelpies, the sea-beasts are all half-human, half\r\nsea-beast, and have a fatal power over human souls, drawing them with\r\na strange lure to give up their immortality. The kelpie appears in\r\nseveral of Fiona McLeod's stories and in _The Judgment of God_ the\r\nmaighdeanhmara, a sea-maid, bewitches Murdoch, coming up out of the\r\nwater as a seal and turning him into a beast, to live with her forever,\r\na black seal that laughs hideously with the laughter of Murdoch. Edward\r\nSheldon has recently written a play[195] using the mermaid motif, and\r\nH. G. Wells employs it as a vehicle for social satire[196] where a\r\nmermaid comes ashore from The Great Beyond and contrasts mortal life\r\nwith hers. _The Merman and the Seraph_, by William Benjamin Smith, is\r\nan unusual combination of unearthly creatures.\r\n\r\n      [195] _The Mermaid._\r\n\r\n      [196] In _The Sea Lady_.\r\n\r\nIn _The Old Men of the Twilight_, W. B. Yeats describes the enchantment\r\ninflicted on the old men of learning, the ancient Druids, who were\r\ncursed by being turned into gray herons that must stand in useless\r\nmeditation in pools or flit in solitary flight cross the world, like\r\npassing sighs. Lady Gregory tells of magic by which Lugh of the Long\r\nHand puts his soul into the body of a mayfly that drops into the\r\ncup that Dechtire drinks from, so that she drinks his soul and must\r\nfollow him to the dwelling-place of the Sidhe, or fairy people. Her\r\nfifty maidens must go with her under a like spell that turns them into\r\nbirds, that fly in nine flocks, linked together two by two with silver\r\nchains, save those that lead who have golden chains. These beautiful\r\nbirds live in the enchanted land far away from their loved ones. J. H.\r\nPearce tells a touching story of the Little Crow of Paradise, of the\r\nbird that was cursed and sent to hell because it mocked Christ on the\r\ncross, but because it had pity on a mortal sufferer in hell and brought\r\nsome cooling drops of water in its bill to cool his parching tongue,\r\nit was allowed to fly up and light on the walls of Paradise where it\r\nremains forever. Oscar Wilde's story _The Nightingale and the Rose_ is\r\nsymbolic of tragic genius, of vain sacrifice, where the tender-hearted\r\nbird gives his life-blood to stain a white rose red because a careless\r\ngirl has told the poet who loves her that she must wear a red rose to\r\nthe ball. But at the last she casts the rose aside and wears the jewels\r\nthat a richer lover has sent, while the nightingale lies dead under the\r\nrose-tree.\r\n\r\nSo we see everywhere in folk-fiction the supernatural power given to\r\nanimals, which acts as an aid to man, as a shield and protection for\r\nhim, or for his undoing. We see human beings turned into beasts as a\r\ncurse from the gods for sin or as expressing the kinship between man\r\nand nature. In the different cycles of beast-tales we find a large\r\nelement of humor, the keener-witted animals possessing a rare sense of\r\nthe comical and relishing a joke on each other as on man. The _Uncle\r\nRemus_ stories are often laughable in the extreme, and Bre'er Rabbit,\r\nwho, we might at first thought decide, would be stupid, is no mean\r\nwit. We see a tragic symbolism in the stories of unhappy beasts who\r\nmust lure mortals to their damnation, yet feel a sense of human sorrow\r\nand remorse. In these animal stories we find most of the significant\r\nqualities of literature, humor, romance, tragedy, mysticism, and\r\nsymbolic poetry, with a deep underlying philosophy of life pervading\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nLord Dunsany in his modern aspects of mythology, perhaps drawn in\r\npart from classic mythology though perhaps altogether Celtic in its\r\nmaterial, brings together animals to which we are not accustomed. He\r\nhas a story of a centaur, a frolicsome creature two hundred and fifty\r\nyears young, who goes caracoling off the end of the world to find his\r\nbride. Algernon Blackwood tells of a man who remembers having been a\r\ncentaur and lives in memory-metempsychosis his experiences of that\r\nfar-off time. Dunsany introduces other curious, unfamiliar beasts to\r\nus, as the bride whom the man-horse seeks in her temple beside her sad\r\nlake-sepulchre, Sombelene, of immortal beauty, whose father was half\r\ncentaur and half god, whose mother the child of a desert lion and the\r\nsphinx. There is the high-priest of Maharrion, who is neither bird nor\r\ncat, but a weird gray beast like both. There is the loathsome dragon\r\nwith glittering golden scales that rattles up the London streets and\r\nseizes Miss Cubbige from her balcony and carries her off to the eternal\r\nlands of romance lying far away by the ancient, soundless sea. We must\r\nnot forget the Gladsome Beast, he who dwells underneath fairyland,\r\nat the edge of the world, the beast that eats men and destroys the\r\ncabbages of the Old Man Who Looks after Fairyland, but is the synonym\r\nfor joy. His joyous chuckles never cease till Ackronnion sings of the\r\nmalignity of time, when the Gladsome Beast weeps great tears into an\r\nagate bowl. There are the hippogriffs, dancing and whirling in the far\r\nsunlight, coming to earth with whirring flight, bathing in the pure\r\ndawn, one to be caught with a magic halter, to carry its rider past the\r\nUnder Pits to the City of Never. There are the gnoles in their high\r\nhouse, whose silence is unearthly \"like the touch of a ghoul,\" over\r\nwhich is \"a look in the sky that is worse than a spoken doom,\" that\r\nwatch the mortals through holes in the trunks of trees and bear them\r\naway to their fate. Lord Dunsany looses the reins of his fancy to carry\r\nhim into far, ancient lands, to show us the wonders that never were.\r\n\r\nMagic forms an alluring element of the supernatural romance, and we\r\nfind it manifesting itself in many ways. In the romances of William\r\nMorris, prose as well as poetry, we find enchantment recurring again\r\nand again, as in _The Water of the Wondrous Isles_, _The Wood beyond\r\nthe World_, _The Well at the World's End_, and others. Yeats said\r\nthat Morris's style in these old stories was the most beautiful prose\r\nhe had ever read, and that it influenced his own work greatly. He has\r\nunearthly characters, such as the Witch-wife, the Wood-wife, the Stony\r\nPeople, and so forth. He shows us the enchanted boat, the Sending\r\nBoat, the cage with the golden bars which prison the three maidens,\r\nmagic runes with mighty power, the Water of Might which gives to the\r\none drinking it supernatural vision and magic power, the changing\r\nskin, the Wailing Tower, the Black Valley of the Greyweathers, and so\r\nforth. Birdalone's swoon-dream in the White Palace is unearthly, as the\r\nwitches' wordless howls. Part of the weirdness of Morris's prose is due\r\nto the antique tone, the forgotten words, the rune-like quality of the\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\nYeats tells of magic whereby a woman is gifted with immortal youth and\r\nbeauty, so that she may wed the prince of the fairies; of the glamour\r\nthat falls on a mortal so that he loses his wits and remains \"with\r\nhis head on his knees by the fire to the day of his death\"; of shadow\r\nhares, of fire-tongued hounds that follow the lost soul across the\r\nworld, of whistling seals that sink great ships, of bat-like darker\r\npowers, of the little gray doves of the good.\r\n\r\nDr. Hyde, in his _Paudeen O'Kelly and the Weasel_, speaks of a\r\nsun-myth, of a haunted forest, of a princess supernaturally beautiful,\r\nof the witch who complains to the robber, \"Why did you bring away my\r\ngold that I was for five hundred years gathering through the hills and\r\nhollows of the world?\"\r\n\r\nLady Gregory tells of Diarmuid's love-spot, where Youth touched him\r\non the forehead, so that no woman could look upon him without giving\r\nhim her love; of Miach who put the eye of a cat in a man's head, with\r\ninconvenient results, for\r\n\r\n  when he wanted to sleep and take his rest, it is then the eye would\r\n  start at the squeaking of the mice, or the flight of birds, or the\r\n  movement of the rushes; and when he was wanting to watch an army or\r\n  a gathering, it is then it was sure to be in a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nShe shows us Druid rods that change mortals into birds; of Druid mists\r\nthat envelop armies and let the ancient heroes win; of Druid sleep\r\nthat lasts sometimes for years; of the screaming stone; of kisses that\r\nturn into birds, some of them saying, \"Come! Come!\" and others \"I go!\r\nI go!\"; of invisible walls that shield one from sight; of magic that\r\nmakes armies from stalks of grass; of wells of healing that cure every\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde, in his fairy stories and symbolic allegories, tells of\r\nmagic, whereby the Happy Prince, high on the pedestal on the square,\r\nhas a heart of lead because he sees the misery of the people, and sends\r\na swallow as his messenger to pick out his jeweled eyes and take them\r\nto the suffering ones. He speaks of the wonder by which the bodies of\r\nthe mermaid and the fisherman who lost his soul for love of her, when\r\nthey are buried in unconsecrated ground, send forth strange flowers\r\nthat are placed on the sacred altar.\r\n\r\nThe dark enchantment appears in the poetry as often as in the prose,\r\nfrom Coleridge's _Christabel_ to the present. Gordon Bottomley's _The\r\nCrier by Night_ is a story of an evil presence that lurks in a pool,\r\ncoming out to steal the souls of those it can lure into its waters. The\r\nwoman, desperate from jealousy, who invokes its aid, says:\r\n\r\n   \"For I can use this body worn to a soul\r\n    To barter with the Crier of hidden things\r\n    That if he tangle him in his chill hair\r\n    Then I will follow and follow and follow and follow\r\n    Past where the ringed stars ebb past the light\r\n    And turn to water under the dark world!\"\r\n\r\nThe fairy has always been a favorite being with poets, dramatists,\r\nand romancers, from Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton to the present\r\ntime. There is no figure more firmly established in folk-literature,\r\nnone more difficult to dislodge despite their delicacy and ethereal\r\nqualities than the Little People. The belief in fairies is firmly\r\nestablished in Gaelic-speaking sections and the Celtic peasant would as\r\nsoon give up his religion as his belief in the Sidhe. W. B. Yeats, in\r\n_Celtic Twilight_, tells of an Irish woman of daring unbelief in hell,\r\nor in ghosts who, she held, would not be permitted to go trapsin' about\r\nthe earth at their own free will, but who asserted, \"There are fairies,\r\nand little leprechauns, and water-horses, and fallen angels.\" Everybody\r\namong the peasantry believes in fairies, \"for they stand to reason.\"\r\nAnd there are not wanting others more learned that believe in the small\r\nfolk, as W. Y. E. Wentz, who in his volume _Fairy Faith in Celtic\r\nCountries_ puts up a loyal argument for the existence of the Sidhe. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  Fairies exist, because in all essentials they appear to be the\r\n  same as the intelligent forces now recognized by psychological\r\n  researchers, be they thus collective units of consciousness like\r\n  what William James calls soul-stuff or more individual units like\r\n  veridical apparitions.\r\n\r\nIf it were left to me, I'd as soon not believe in fairies as have to\r\nthink of them as veridical units! Mr. Wentz has never seen any fairies\r\nhimself, but he tells a number of stories to substantiate his faith in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe volumes of fairy stories are by no means all for juvenile\r\nconsumption, since the modern adult dearly loves the type himself.\r\nMany, or most, of the stories of fairies told frankly for children are\r\nadaptations or variants of continental folk-legends. The more literary\r\nside of fairy-literature has come from the Celtic lore, for the Dim\r\nPeople are dearest of all supernatural beings to the Celtic soul. The\r\nIrish, more innately poetic than most races, cling more fondly to the\r\nbeings of beauty and gather round them delicate, undying stories. W. B.\r\nYeats, Lady Gregory, Lady Wilde, Oscar Wilde, John Singe, and Fiona\r\nMcLeod have given in poetry and lyric prose the Celtic fairy-lore, and\r\nhave made us know the same wild, sweet thrill that the peasants feel.\r\nThe poetic thought of the primitive races peoples everything in nature,\r\nevery bird and blossom and tree, with its own fairy personality.\r\n\r\nThackeray has written a fairy pantomime for great and small children,\r\nas he says, in which the adventures of Prince Giglio and Prince Bulbo\r\nare recounted. Eugene Field has a charming story of the _Fairies of\r\nPesth_, and Charles Kingsley's _Water Babies_ enriched the imagination\r\nof most of us in youthful or adult years with its charming nonsense\r\nof beings possible and impossible. J. M. Barrie in _Peter Pan_ won\r\nthe doubtful world over to a confessed faith in the fairy-folk, for\r\ndid we not see the marvels before our eyes? In _The Little White\r\nBird_ Barrie tells us how fairies came to be,--that they have their\r\norigin in the first laugh of the first baby that broke into a million\r\nbits and went skipping about, each one a fairy. He shows us the wee\r\nfolk in Kensington Gardens, where by the ignorant they are mistaken\r\nfor flowers, but children and those with the poet heart can see the\r\nflashing faces and green garments of the fairies among the pansy beds.\r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats is a favorite with the fairies, for they have given him the\r\ndower of magic vision, to glimpse the unseen things, to hear the faint,\r\nmusical voices of fairy pipes and song. He tells us many stories of the\r\nDim People, in his tales and dramas. _The Land of Heart's Desire_,\r\nthe story of the struggle between the divine and mortal forces and the\r\npowers of the Sidhe to claim the soul of the young wife and of the\r\ntriumph of the fairies, by which the girl's body falls lifeless by the\r\nhearth while her spirit speeds away to live forever in the land \"where\r\nnobody gets old or sorry or poor,\" has a poignant pathos, a wild,\r\ndreamy beauty that touches the heart. Yeats tells of the Imperishable\r\nRose of Beauty, of fantastic doings of the fairy-folk who steal mortals\r\naway, especially new-born babies or new-wed brides, of evil fairies who\r\nslay men in malice, and of the dances by moonlit hillside when mortals\r\nare asleep.\r\n\r\nJames Stephens in _The Crock of Gold_ mingles delightfully fairy-lore\r\nwith other elements of the supernatural, as talking beasts, and\r\ninsects, the gods, a leprechaun, and Pan, combining with the droll\r\nphilosophy of the bachelor man to make a charming social satire. The\r\nunion of the world of reality with that of the wee people is seen\r\nin the sad little story of H. G. Wells, _The Man Who Had Been in\r\nFairyland_. A crude, materialistic middle-class Englishman, in love\r\nwith an ordinary young woman, falls asleep on a fairy knoll one night\r\nand is kidnapped by the Dim People who take him to their country, where\r\ntheir queen falls in love with him. She vainly woos him, but he is\r\nstolidly true to the thick-ankled girl of the town, until the fairies\r\nsend him back in sleep to mortal life. But when he wakes on the knoll\r\nhe is home-sick for fairyland, he cares no more for the village girl\r\nwho seems coarse and repulsive compared with the elfin creature whose\r\nlove he might have kept in the land of wonder, so he is wretched,\r\nunable to fit again into mortal life and unable to reopen the doors\r\nthat closed inexorably upon him by his wish. This is a modern version\r\nof the motif of the mortal lover and the fairy bride that we find\r\nso often in mediæval ballads and romances, a survival of the Celtic\r\nwonder-lore. Arthur Lewis in _London Fairy Tales_ writes philosophic\r\nhuman stories in the guise of fairy tales, attempting frankly to bring\r\nthe impossible into contact with daily life. They are weird little\r\nsymbolic stories with an earthly wisdom associated with unearthly\r\nbeings. _The Passionate Crime_, by E. Temple Thurston, is a symbolic\r\nfairy novel, the fairies being figures of the man's besetting sins,\r\nbodiless presences blown on the winds of feeling, as the woman he loves\r\nis lured by the fairy of her own beauty.\r\n\r\nWhether fairyland be an actual place or a state of mind, it is a\r\nprovince still open to romancers, and folklorists have aroused a\r\nnew interest in the Little People who may come nearer to us than\r\nbefore. The flood of volumes recounting Celtic folk-tales with their\r\nfairy-lore alone would make a long catalogue, and one can do no more\r\nthan suggest the presence of the fairy in English fiction. Andrew Lang\r\nwas a faithful lover of the Sidhe and made many collections of fairy\r\nstories, Eden Phillpotts has written much of them, and various writers\r\nhave opened their magic to us. Some place the land of faerie under\r\nthe ground, some in secret caves, some in the mind, and Lord Dunsany\r\nsays that the Old Man Who Looks after Fairyland lives in a house whose\r\nparlor windows look away from the world, and \"empties his slops sheer\r\non to the Southern Cross.\"\r\n\r\nWe find many stories of gods, demigods, and heroes tangled up together\r\nin folk-tales and in the literature they have influenced. It is\r\nsometimes difficult to distinguish between them, and again it is\r\ninteresting to note how the hero-myth has been converted into the tale\r\nof a god. Celtic romances and folk-supernaturalism give many stories of\r\ngods, demigods, and heroes of superhuman force. It would be interesting\r\nif one could trace them to their ultimate sources and discover how\r\nmuch they have been suggested or influenced by classical mythology.\r\nIn _Fiction of the Irish Celts_, by Patrick Kennedy, are numberless\r\nstories of the Fianna Eironn, or Heroes of Ireland, some of whom really\r\nflourished in the third century and whose adventures were the favorite\r\nstories of the kings and chiefs as sung by the ancient bards. Kennedy\r\nalso retells many of the Ossianic legends. In _Bardic Stories of\r\nIreland_ he relates the exploits of personages dating back to druidic\r\ntimes and earlier, who reflect the remote stages of the legendary\r\nhistory of the people, such as the antique King Fergus, who was given\r\nsupernatural power by the fairies and slew the sea-monster; Cormac,\r\nwho did many doughty deeds assisted by the powers of the Immortals,\r\nand many others. W. B. Yeats, in his _Stories of Red Ranrahan_, gives\r\nus glimpses of an Irish François Villon, a man of wandering nature, of\r\nhuman frailties, yet with a divine gift of song.\r\n\r\nLady Gregory tells the wonderful saga of Cuchulain, the hero-god of\r\nIreland, in _Cuchulain of Muirthemne_, which W. B. Yeats calls \"perhaps\r\nthe best book that has ever come out of Ireland.\" It was his mother\r\nDechtire that drank the soul of Lugh of the Strong Hand, as he flew\r\ninto her wine-cup in the form of a Mayfly, so that she was bound by\r\nenchantment and carried away with her fifty maidens as a flock of\r\nlovely birds. When anger came upon him the hero light would shine about\r\nhis head, he understood all the arts of the druids and had supernatural\r\nbeauty and strength in battle. Cuchulain, the Hound of Ulster, and his\r\nRed Branch have filled the legendry of Ireland with wonder.\r\n\r\nLady Gregory tells of the high king of Ireland who married Etain of\r\nthe Sidhe; of the nine pipers that came out of the hill of the Sidhe,\r\nwhom to fight with was to fight with a shadow, for they could not be\r\nkilled; of Conchobar, the king, that loved Deirdre of the burning\r\nbeauty for whom many candles of the Gael were blown out; of Cruachan,\r\nwho knew druid enchantments greater than the magic of the fairies so\r\nthat he was able to fight with the Dim People and overcome them, and\r\nto cover the whole province with a deep snow so that they could not\r\nfollow him. In _Gods and Fighting Men_ Lady Gregory tells of ancient\r\ndivinities that met men as equals. We come to know Oisin, son of Finn,\r\nwho is king over a divine country; of the Men of Dea who fought against\r\nthe misshapen Fomer. Men are called to the country of Under-Wave where\r\nthe gods promise them all their desires, as the god Medhir tells\r\nQueen Etain that in his country one never grows old, that there is no\r\nsorrow, no care among invisible gods. She tells us of Finn, who fought\r\nwith monsters, who killed many great serpents in Loch Cuilinn, and\r\nShadow-shapes at Loch Lein, and fought with the three-headed hag, and\r\nnine headless bodies that raised harsh screeches. We meet Diarmuid,\r\nwho married a daughter of King Under-Wave, who raised a house by\r\nenchantment, and whom Grania, of the fatal beauty, loved.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Curtin, Aldis Dunbar, and many another writer have told us\r\nof the wonderful legends of the Celtic gods and heroes, who somehow\r\nseem more human than Arthur and his Table Round or any of the English\r\nmythical heroes.\r\n\r\nIt is Lord Dunsany, however, who specializes in gods in recent\r\ntimes. He fairly revels in divinities and demons, in idols and\r\nout-of-the-world creatures. His dramas of this nature are mentioned in\r\nanother connection, as _A Night at an Inn_, where a jade idol slays\r\nwith silent horror the men who have stolen his emerald eye; _The Gods\r\nof the Mountains_, where seven beggars masquerade as the mountain gods\r\ncome to life, and some of the people believe but some doubt. But at\r\nlast the seven gods from the mountain come down, terrible figures of\r\ngreen stone, and with sinister menace point terrible fingers at the\r\nbeggars, who stiffen as on pedestals, draw their feet under them like\r\nthe cross-legged posture of the images, and turn to stone, so that the\r\npeople coming say: \"They were the true gods. They have turned to stone\r\nbecause we doubted them.\" In _The Gods of Pegana_ are many fantastic\r\ntales of divinities never heard of before, whom Dunsany calls to life\r\nwith the lavish ease of genius and makes immortal. In _Time and the\r\nGods_ we see many gods, with their servant the swart, sinister Time\r\nwho serves them, but maliciously. The gods dream marble dreams that\r\nhave magic power, for \"with domes and pinnacles the dreams arose and\r\nstood up proudly between the river and the sky, all shimmering white to\r\nthe morning.\" But Sardathrion, this city of visions, is overthrown by\r\nhateful Time, whereat the mighty gods weep grievous tears. He tells us\r\nof Slid, a new god that comes striding through the stars, past where\r\nthe ancient divinities are seated on their thrones, as a million waves\r\nmarch behind him; of Inzana, the daughter of all the gods who plays\r\nwith the sun as her golden ball and weeps when it falls into the sea,\r\nso that Umborodom with his thunder hound must seek it again and again\r\nfor her. He whispers to us of the prophet who saw the gods one night as\r\nthey strode knee-deep in stars, and above them a mighty hand, showing\r\na higher power. The gods are jealous of him that he has seen, so they\r\nrob him of knowledge of the gods, of moon and sky, of butterflies and\r\nflowers, and all lovely things. And last they steal his soul away from\r\nhim, from which they make the South Wind, forever to roam the waste\r\nspaces of the world, mournful, unremembering.\r\n\r\nIn _The Book of Wonder_ are still other gods, as Hlo-Hlo, who wears\r\nthe haloes of other gods on golden hooks along his hunting-belt;\r\nthe Sphinx, who \"remembers in her smitten mind at which little boys\r\nnow leer, that she once knew well those things at which man stands\r\naghast\"; the certain disreputable god who knows nothing of etiquette\r\nand will grant prayers that no respectable god would ever consent to\r\nhear; Chu-chu and Sheemish, who become angry with each other and raise\r\nrival earthquakes that destroy their temple and them. We are told of\r\nthe Gibbelins that eat men, whose home is beyond the known regions, and\r\nwhose treasures many burglars try in vain to steal only to meet death\r\ninstead. Alderic tries a crafty way to evade them but they are waiting\r\nfor him. \"And without saying a word _or even smiling_ they neatly hang\r\nhim on the outer wall,--and the tale is one of those that have not a\r\nhappy ending.\" But enough of gods!--though we should not forget the\r\nAztec legend on which Lew Wallace's novel, _The Fair God_, was founded,\r\nof the white divinity who was to come and rule the people.\r\n\r\nThere are many other elements of folkloristic supernaturalism that\r\ncannot be mentioned, as the banshee, the wailful creature that is a\r\npresager of death and the loss of the soul; the fetches, ghosts of the\r\nliving, whom John and Michael Banim write much about; the pixies, as\r\nappearing in such works as S. Baring-Gould's _Eve_, and Stephens's _The\r\nCrock of Gold_; the mountain trolls that play pranks on Ibsen's Peer\r\nGynt and Irving's Rip van Winkle; the \"worrie-cow\" that Scott tells\r\nabout; the saints and miracles that abound in Celtic literature as in\r\nthat of any Catholic country, and such as Thomas A. Janvier has told\r\nof so delightfully in his legends of the City of Mexico. The giant has\r\nalmost faded from fiction, since, poor thing, he doesn't fit in well\r\nwith the modern scheme of housing. He came into the Gothic novel from\r\nthe Oriental tale where he had his origin, but now he appears in our\r\nfiction only sporadically, as in Oscar Wilde's _The Selfish Giant_,\r\nin a couple of stories by Blackwood, and a few others. We are glad to\r\nmeet him occasionally in frank folk-tales since literature at large\r\nrepudiates this favorite of our youth. He would not suit well on the\r\nstage, for obvious reasons, and realism rejects him.\r\n\r\nLord Dunsany tells of elves and gnomes, of the Moomoo, of the magic\r\nsword called Mouse, of the gnoles that caught Tonker, of the ancient\r\nThuls, of the window that opened to the magic of the world, and of many\r\nother things which only the very young or the very wise care for.\r\n\r\nArthur Machen deals with strange, sinister aspects of supernaturalism\r\nunlike the wholesome folklore that other writers reveal to us. He seems\r\nto take his material chiefly from the Pit, to let loose upon the world\r\na slimy horde of unnamable spirits of ageless evil. One reads of the\r\nWhite People, who are most loathsome fairies under whose influence the\r\nrocks dance obscene dances in the Witches' Sabbath, and the great white\r\nmoon seems an unclean thing. Images of clay made by human hands come\r\nto diabolic life, and at mystic incantations the nymph Alanna turns\r\nthe pool in the woodland to a pool of fire. In _The Great God Pan_ the\r\ntimeless menace comes to earth again, corrupting the souls of men and\r\nwomen, rendering them unbelievably vile. In _The Red Hand_ he brings\r\ntogether ancient runes with magic power, black stones that tell secrets\r\nof buried treasure, flinty stone like obsidian ten thousand years old\r\nthat murders a man on a London street, a whorl of figures that tell of\r\nthe black heaven, giving an impression of vast ages of enigmatic power.\r\nOne feels one should rinse his mind out after reading Arthur Machen's\r\nstories, particularly the collection called _The Three Impostors_.\r\n\r\nThis discussion has taken more note of the Celtic folk-fiction than\r\nof any other group influence, because more than any other it has left\r\nits imprint on modern literature. There are hundreds of volumes of\r\nfolk-tales of the supernatural in English, but the Celtic Revival has\r\nmolded its legends into literature that is its own excuse for being.\r\nIn the work of this school we get a passionate mysticism, a poetic\r\nsymbolism that we find scarcely anywhere else in English prose, save\r\nin such rhapsodic passages as some of De Quincey's impassioned prose.\r\nMelody, which forms so large a part of the effect of supernaturalism\r\nin poetry, is here employed to heighten lyric prose. Some of the wild\r\nstories are like the croon of the peasant mother by her cradle beside\r\nthe peat-fire, some like wild barbaric runes of terrible unguessed\r\nimport, some like the battle-cry of hero-gods, some like the keening of\r\nwomen beside their dead. The essential poetry of the Celtic soul pours\r\nitself forth in rapturous, wistful music, now like a chant, a hymn, a\r\nwedding-song, a lament for the lost soul.\r\n\r\nIn the Celtic folk-tales we get a mixture of romances, of the survivals\r\nof barbaric days, the ancient druid myths, the pagan legends, savage\r\nbeliefs overlaid and interwoven with the later Christian traditions.\r\nSometimes the old pagan myths themselves become moral allegories,\r\nthe legend being used to tell a late-learned moral truth. But, for\r\nthe most part, there is no attempt at teaching save that which comes\r\nspontaneously, the outburst of passionate, poetic romance, the heritage\r\nof a people that love wonder and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe pagan poetry of the Gaelic race lives on and throbs over again in\r\nFiona McLeod's symbolic moralities. The mystical figures of awe and\r\nwoe appear from the dim past, a rapturous paganism showing through the\r\nmedieval religious brooding. Yet they are so symbolic of the spirit\r\nthat they are timeless. Coming as they do out of the dim legendary\r\npast, they may reflect the veiled years of the future. They are mystic\r\nchronicles of the soul, as in _The Divine Adventure_, where the Body\r\nand Will alike shrink back from that \"silent, sad-eyed foreigner, the\r\nSoul.\"\r\n\r\nIn the stories of Yeats we get similar effects, the weird power of the\r\nold curse-making bards, the gift of second-sight, a spiritual vision,\r\nthe spiritual sense that hears past the broken discordant sounds the\r\nmusic of the world, the power to catch the moment \"that trembles with\r\nthe Song of Immortal Powers.\" We hear faint whispers, catch fleeting\r\nglimpses of the Dim People, see again the druids, the culdees, the\r\nancient bards and heroes. We discern in the Celtic literature a\r\nsadness, dim, unreasoning yet deep, such as we see in the faces of\r\nanimals and little children. We see such symbolism as that of the\r\nself-centered lovers who have heart-shaped mirrors instead of hearts,\r\nseeing only their own images throughout eternity. We feel the poetic\r\nthoughts drifting past us like sweet falling rose-leaves, bright with\r\nthe colors of bygone years, like fluttering bird-wings, like happy\r\nsighs. Yet again they are terrible trumpets blown in the day of doom.\r\nWe have the modern mysticism and symbolism side by side with the old\r\ndruidic mysticism, which seems like dream-stuff with deep spiritual\r\nimport. Yeats makes us feel that the old divinities are not dead,\r\nbut have taken up their abode in the hearts of poets and writers of\r\nromance, and that the land of faery is all about us if we would only\r\nsee. But we lack the poetic vision. He makes us see the actuality of\r\nthought, that thinking has its own vital being and goes out into the\r\nworld like a living thing, possessed by some wandering soul. He shows\r\nus that thought can create black hounds or silver doves to follow the\r\nsoul, bring to life at will a divinity or a demon.\r\n\r\nA certain supernatural element of style seems to lend itself to some\r\nof the writers of strange fiction. Some of Oscar Wilde's sentences\r\nunfold like wild, exotic flowers, in a perfumed beauty that suggests a\r\nsubtle poison at the heart. Lord Dunsany writes joyously of fantastic\r\ncreatures with a happy grace, sometimes like a lilting laugh, sometimes\r\na lyric rhapsody. His evoked beings are sportive or awesome but never\r\nunclean. Arthur Machen's stories have an effect like a slimy trail\r\nof some loathly beast or serpent. William Morris's style is like an\r\nold Norse rune, while Algernon Blackwood makes us think of awakened,\r\nelemental forces hostile to man. We feel bodiless emotions, feelings\r\nunclothed with flesh, sad formless spirits blown on the winds of the\r\nworld. These folk-tales reflect the sweet carelessness of the Irish\r\nsoul, the stern sadness of the Scotch, the psychic subtlety of the\r\nmodern English. And as the study of folk-lore has influenced the\r\nfiction of the supernatural, so these published romances have aroused a\r\nwondering interest in the legendry of the past and made of folk-lore a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSupernatural Science\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of modern science to supernaturalism, or of the\r\nsupernatural to modern science, is one of the distinctive features\r\nof recent literature. Ghostly fiction took a new and definite turn\r\nwith the rapid advance in scientific knowledge and investigation in\r\nthe latter part of the nineteenth century, for the work of Darwin,\r\nSpencer, Huxley, and their co-laborers did as much to quicken thought\r\nin romance as in other lines. Previous literature had made but scant\r\neffort to reflect even the crude science of the times, and what\r\nwas written was so unconvincing that it made comparatively little\r\nimpress. Almost the only science that Gothic fiction dealt with, to\r\nany noticeable extent, was associated with alchemy and astrology. The\r\nalchemist sought the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life while\r\nthe astrologer tried to divine human destiny by the stars. Zofloya\r\ndabbled in diabolic chemistry, and Frankenstein created a man-monster\r\nthat was noteworthy as an incursion into supernatural biology, yet\r\nthey are almost isolated instances. Now each advance in science has\r\nhad its reflection in supernatural fiction and each phase of research\r\ncontributes plot material, while some of the elements once considered\r\nwholly of the devil are now scientific. The sorcerer has given place\r\nto the bacteriologist and the botanist, the marvels of discovery have\r\ndisplaced miracles as basis for unearthly plot material, and it is\r\nfrom the laboratory that the ghostly stories are now evolved, rather\r\nthan from the vault and charnel-room as in the past. Science not only\r\nfurnishes extraordinary situations for curdling tales, but it is an\r\nexcellent hook to hang supernatural tales upon, for it gives an excuse\r\nfor believing anything, however incredible. Man is willing to accept\r\nthe impossible, if he be but given a modern excuse for it. He will\r\nswallow the wildest improbability if the bait be labeled science or\r\npsychical research. No supernaturalism is incredible if it is expressed\r\nin technical terminology, and no miracle will be rejected if its\r\nsetting be in a laboratory. One peculiar thing about modern scientific\r\nthought in its reaction upon fiction is that it is equally effective in\r\nrealism, such as shown in the naturalistic novels of Zola, the plays\r\nof Brieux and others, and in supernaturalism, as in the work of H. G.\r\nWells, for instance, where the ghostly is grafted on to cold realism.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the sorcerer, the wizard, the warlock of older\r\nfiction to the scientist in the present has been gradual. The sorcerer\r\nrelied wholly upon supernatural, chiefly diabolic, agencies for his\r\npower, while the wizard of the modern laboratory applies his knowledge\r\nof molecules and gases to aid his supermortal forces. Modern science\r\nitself seems miraculous, so its employment in ghostly stories is\r\nbut natural. The _Arabian Nights' Tales_ seem not more marvelous\r\nthan the stories of modern investigations. Hawthorne's narratives\r\nstand between the old and the new types of science, his Rappaccini,\r\nDr. Heidigger, Gaffer Dolliver, Septimius Felton and his rivals in\r\nsearch for the elixir of youth, as well as the husband who sought to\r\nefface the birthmark from his young wife's cheek, being related in\r\ntheme to the older conventional type and in treatment to the new.\r\nPoe's scientific stories are more modern in method and material, and\r\nin fact he made claim of originality of invention for the idea of\r\nmaking fiction plausible by the use of scientific laws. His _Descent\r\ninto the Maelstrom_, _MS. Found in a Bottle_, and other stories were\r\nnovel in the manner in which they united the scientifically real and\r\nthe supernatural. _The Pit and the Pendulum_, with its diabolical\r\nmachinery, is akin to the modern mechanistic stories rather than to\r\nanything that had preceded it. Poe paved the way for H. G. Wells's use\r\nof the ghostly mechanical and scientific narratives, as his stories\r\nof hypnotism with its hideous aftermath of horror must have given\r\nsuggestion for Arthur Machen's revolting stories of physical operations\r\nwith unearthly consequences. An example of the later manifestations of\r\nsupernaturalism in connection with science is in Sax Rohmer's tales\r\nof Fu-Manchu, the Chinese terror, the embodied spirit of an ancient\r\nevil that entered into him at his birth, because of his nearness to an\r\nold burying-ground, and who, to his unholy alliance unites a wizard\r\nknowledge of modern science in its various aspects. With every power of\r\ncunning and intellect intensified, with a technical knowledge of all\r\nmeans with which to fight his enemies, he ravages society as no mere\r\nsorcerer of early fiction could do.\r\n\r\nThe modern stories of magic have a skillful power of suggestiveness,\r\nbeing so cunningly contrived that on the surface they seem plausible\r\nand natural, with nothing supernatural about them. Yet behind this\r\nseeming simplicity lurks a mystery, an unanswered question, an unsolved\r\nproblem. W. W. Jacobs's _The Monkey's Paw_, for instance, is one of\r\nthe most effectively terrible stories of magic that one could conceive\r\nof. The shriveled paw of a dead monkey, that is believed by some to\r\ngive its possessor the right to have three wishes granted, becomes the\r\nsymbol of inescapable destiny, the Weird, or Fate of the old tragedy,\r\nthough the horrors that follow upon the wishes' rash utterance _may_\r\nbe explained on natural grounds. The insidious enigma is what makes the\r\nstory unforgettable. Barry Pain's _Exchange_ might be given as another\r\nexample of problematic magic that owes its power to elusive mystery.\r\nThe witch-woman, the solitary Fate, who appears to persons offering\r\nthem such dreadful alternatives, might be conceived of as the figment\r\nof sick brains, yet the reader knows that she is not.\r\n\r\nRichard Middleton's _The Coffin Merchant_ seems simple enough on the\r\nsurface, and the literal-minded could explain the occurrence on normal\r\ngrounds, yet the story has a peculiar haunting supernaturalism. A\r\ncoffin merchant claims to be able to know who among passers-by will die\r\nsoon, and hands a man an advertisement for a coffin, asserting that he\r\nwill need it. The man later goes to the shop to rebuke the merchant\r\nfor his methods but ends by signing a contract for his own funeral. On\r\nleaving, he shakes hands with the dealer, after which he unconsciously\r\nputs his hand to his lips, feeling a slight sting. He dies that\r\nnight,--of what? Of poison, of fear, of supernatural suggestion, or in\r\nthe natural course of events? The series called _The Strange Cases of\r\nDr. Stanchion_, by Josephine Daskam Bacon, shows instances occurring\r\namong the clientele of a famous brain specialist, where the materialist\r\nmight put aside the explanation of the supernatural, only to be\r\nconfronted by still greater problems. The relation between insanity and\r\nghostliness in recent fiction is significant and forms the crux of many\r\na story since Poe. Mrs. Bacon's _The Miracle_, for instance, has its\r\nsetting in an insane asylum, but the uncanny happenings almost convince\r\nus of the sanity of the patients and the paranoia of the outsiders. We\r\ncome to agree with the specialist that every person is more or less a\r\nparanoiac, and none more so than he who scoffs at the supernatural.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the transfer of magic in modern fiction to a\r\nscientific basis is that of second sight or supernatural vision. This\r\nmotif still retains all its former effect of the unearthly, perhaps\r\ngaining more, since the scientific twist seems to give the idea that\r\nthe ghostly power resides in the atoms and molecules and gases and\r\nmachines themselves, rather than in the person who manipulates them,\r\nwhich is more subtly haunting in its impression. Second sight has been\r\nused as a means for producing uncanny effects all along the line of\r\nfiction. Defoe even used it in a number of his hoax pamphlets, as well\r\nas in his _History of Duncan Campbell_, and folk-lore is full of such\r\nstories, especially in the Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe modern use of supernatural vision is based apparently on natural\r\nscience, which makes the weird power more striking. _The Black Patch_,\r\nby Randolph Hartley, tells of an experiment in optics that produces a\r\nstrange result. Two students exchange left eyeballs for the purpose\r\nof studying the effects of the operation, leaving the right eye in\r\neach case unimpaired. When the young men recover from the operation\r\nand the bandages are removed, they discover that an extraordinary\r\nthing has taken place. The first, while seeing with his right eye\r\nhis own surroundings as usual, sees also with his left--which is his\r\nfriend's left, that is--what that friend is looking at with his right\r\neye, thousands of miles away. The severing of the optic nerve has not\r\ndisturbed the sympathetic vision between the companion eyes, so this\r\ncurious double sight results. In a quarrel arising from this peculiar\r\nsituation, the first man kills the second, and sees on his left eye the\r\nhideous image of his own face distorted with murderous rage, as his\r\nfriend saw it, which is never to be effaced, because the companion eye\r\nis dead and will see no more.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of farsightedness is told in John Kendrick Bangs's\r\n_The Speck on the Lens_, where a man has such an extraordinary left\r\neye that when he looks through a lens he sees round the world, and gets\r\na glimpse of the back of his own head which he thinks is a speck on the\r\nlens. Only two men in the world are supposed to have that power.\r\n\r\n_The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes_, by H. G. Wells, is an\r\ninteresting example of this new scientific transference of magic\r\nvision. Davidson is working in a laboratory which is struck by\r\nlightning, and after the shock he finds himself unable to visualize\r\nhis surroundings, but instead sees the other side of the world, ships,\r\na sea, sands. The explanation given by a professor turns on learned\r\ntheories of space and the Fourth Dimension. He thinks that Davidson,\r\nin stooping between the poles of the electro-magnet, experienced a\r\nqueer twist in his mental retinal elements through the sudden force\r\nof the lightning. As the author says: \"It sets one dreaming of the\r\noddest possibilities of intercommunication in the future, of spending\r\nan intercalary five minutes on the other side of the world, of being\r\nwatched in our most secret operations by unexpected eyes.\" Davidson's\r\nvision comes back queerly, for he begins to see the things around him\r\nby piecemeal, as apparently the two fields of vision overlap for a time.\r\n\r\nBrander Matthews in _The Kinetoscope of Time_ introduces an instrument\r\nwith eyepieces that show magic vision. The beholder sees scenes from\r\nthe past, from literature as well as from life, has glimpses of Salome\r\ndancing, of Esmerelda, witnesses the combat between Achilles and\r\nHector, the tourney between Saladin and the Knight of the Leopard. The\r\nmagician offers to show him his future--for a price--but he is wise\r\nenough to refuse.\r\n\r\nMagic views of the future constitute an interesting aspect of the\r\nsupernatural vision in modern stories. _The Lifted Veil_, by George\r\nEliot, is an account of a man who has prophetic glimpses of his fate,\r\nwhich seem powerless to warn him, since he marries the woman who\r\nhe knows will be his doom, and he is aware that he will die alone,\r\ndeserted even by his servants, yet cannot help it. He sees himself\r\ndying, with the attendants off on their own concerns, knows every\r\ndetail beforehand, but unavailingly. This suggests _Amos Judd_, by\r\nJ. A. Mitchell, which is a curious instance of the transition stage of\r\nsecond sight, related both to the old sorcerer type and to the new\r\nscientific ideas. Amos Judd, so called, is the son of an Indian rajah,\r\nsent out of his country because of a revolution, and brought up in\r\nignorance of his birth in a New England farmhouse. Vishnu, in the far\r\npast, has laid his finger on the brow of one of the rajah's ancestors,\r\nthereby endowing him with the gift of magic vision, which descends\r\nonce in a hundred years to some one of his line. Amos Judd therefore,\r\ncan see the future by pictures, beholding clearly everything that will\r\nhappen to him. He sees himself lying dead at a desk, on which stands a\r\ncalendar marking the date, November 4th. His friends persuade him to\r\nlive past the date, and they think all is well, till one day while he\r\nis on a visit to a strange house he is killed by an assassin. They find\r\nhim lying at a desk, with an out-of-date calendar beside him, marking\r\nNovember 4th.\r\n\r\nBarry Pain endows a bulldog with the power to foretell the future, to\r\nreveal disaster and oppose it. Zero, in the story by that name, is a\r\ncommon bulldog greatly valued because he has a supernatural knowledge\r\nof any evil that threatens those he loves, and by his canine sagacity\r\nhe forestalls fate. In the end, in protecting his master's little\r\nchild, he is bitten by a mad dog, whose coming he has supernaturally\r\nforeseen, and he commits suicide as the only way out of the difficulty.\r\nArthur Machen, in _The Bowmen and Others_, tells varied stories of\r\nsupernatural vision associated with the war.\r\n\r\n_The Door in the Wall_, by H. G. Wells, depicts a man who in his\r\ndreamy childhood wanders into a secret garden where he is shown the\r\nbook of his past and future, but who afterwards is unable to find the\r\ndoor by which he enters, though he seeks it often. Later in life,\r\nat several times when he is in a special haste to reach some place\r\nfor an important appointment, he sees the door, but does not enter.\r\nFinally he goes in to his death. This is an instance of the suggestive\r\nsupernaturalism associated with dreams and visions.\r\n\r\nThe use of mirrors in supernatural vision is significant and appears\r\nin a number of ways in modern fiction. Scott's _My Aunt Margaret's\r\nMirror_ is an early instance, where the magician shows the seeker\r\na glass wherein she sees what is taking place in another country,\r\nsees her husband on his way to the altar with another woman, sees a\r\nstranger stop the marriage, and witnesses the fatal duel. Hawthorne\r\nhas used mirrors extensively as symbolic of an inner vision, of a look\r\ninto the realities of the soul. For instance, when poor Feathertop,\r\nthe make-believe man, the animated scarecrow, looks into the mirror\r\nhe sees not the brave figure the world beholds in him, but the thing\r\nof sticks and straw, the sham that he is, as the minister shrinks\r\nfrom the mirrored reflection of the black veil, symbol of mystery\r\nthat he wears. Hawthorne elsewhere speaks of Echo as the voice of the\r\nreflection in a mirror, and says that our reflections are ghosts of\r\nourselves. Mr. Titbottom, in George William Curtis's _Prue and I_,\r\nwho has the power of seeing into the souls of human beings by means\r\nof his magic spectacles and catching symbolic glimpses of what they\r\nare instead of what they appear to be, beholds himself in a mirror\r\nand shrinks back aghast from the revelation of his own nature. Barry\r\nPain's story, referred to in another connection, shows a mirror wherein\r\na supernatural visitant reveals to a young man the supreme moments of\r\nlife, his own and those of others, pictures of the highest moments of\r\necstasy or despair, of fulfillment of dear dreams.\r\n\r\n_The Silver Mirror_, by A. Conan Doyle, represents a man alone night\r\nafter night, working with overstrained nerves on a set of books, who\r\nsees in an antique mirror a strange scene re-enacted and finds later\r\nthat the glass has once belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, and that\r\nhe has seen the murder of Rizzio. Brander Matthews also has a story\r\nconcerned with re-created images in an old mirror. The looking-glass\r\nin fiction seems to be not only a sort of hand conscience, as Markheim\r\ncalls it, but a betrayer of secrets, a revealer of the forgotten past,\r\na prophet of the future as well. It is also a strange symbol to show\r\nhearts as they are in reality, reflecting the soul rather than the\r\nbody. It is employed in diverse ways and is an effective means of\r\nsupernatural suggestion, of ghostly power.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Dimension is another motif that seems to interest the\r\nwriters of recent ghostly tales. They make use of it in various\r\nways and seem to have different ideas concerning it, but they like\r\nto play with the thought and twist it to their whim. Ambrose Bierce\r\nhas a collection of stories dealing with mysterious disappearances,\r\nin which he tells of persons who are transferred from the known,\r\ncalculable space to some \"non-Euclidean space\" where they are lost.\r\nIn some strange pockets of nowhere they fall, unable to see or to be\r\nseen, to hear or to be heard, neither living nor dying, since \"in that\r\nspace is no power of life or of death.\" It is all very mysterious and\r\nuncanny. He uses the theme as the basis for a number of short stories\r\nof ghostly power, which offer no solution but leave the mystery in the\r\nair. In some of these stories Bierce represents the person as crying\r\nout, and being heard, but no help can go, because he is invisible and\r\nintangible, not knowing where he is nor what has happened to him. H. G.\r\nWells, in _The Plattner Case_, which shows an obvious influence of\r\nBierce, gives a similar case. He explains the extraordinary happenings\r\nby advancing the theory that Plattner has changed sides. According to\r\nmathematics, he says, we are told that the only way in which the right\r\nand left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body\r\nclean out of space as we know it, out of ordinary existence, that is,\r\nand turning it somewhere outside space. Plattner has been moved out\r\ninto the Fourth Dimension and been returned to the world with a curious\r\ninversion of body. He is absent from the world for nine days and has\r\nextraordinary experiences in the Other-World. This happens through an\r\nexplosion in the laboratory where he is working, similarly to Wells's\r\nstory of Davidson, where the infringement on the Fourth Dimension is\r\nthe result of a lightning stroke.\r\n\r\nMary Wilkins Freeman deals with the Fourth Dimension in _The Hall\r\nBedroom_, where the boarder drifts off into unknown space, never to\r\nreturn, from gazing at a picture on the wall, as has happened in the\r\ncase of previous occupants of the room. Richard Middleton employs\r\nthe same idea in a story of a conjurer who nightly plays a trick in\r\npublic, causing his wife to seem to disappear into space. One night she\r\nactually does so vanish, never to be seen again. Other instances of the\r\nform may be found in recent fiction. H. G. Wells uses the theme with\r\na different twist in his _Time Machine_. Here the scientist insists\r\nthat time is the Fourth Dimension, that persons who talk of the matter\r\nordinarily have no idea of what it is, but that he has solved it. He\r\nconstructs a machine which enables him to project himself into the\r\nfuture or into the past, and sees what will happen or what has happened\r\nin other centuries. He lives years in the space of a few moments\r\nand has amazing adventures on his temporal expeditions. But finally\r\nthe Fourth Dimension, which may be thought of as a terrible Fate or\r\ninescapable destiny awaiting all who dally with it, gets him too, for\r\nhe fails to return from one of his trips. Another story tells of a man\r\nwho by drinking quantities of green tea could project himself into the\r\nFourth Dimension.\r\n\r\nA number of stories of scientific supernaturalism are concerned with\r\nglimpses into the future. _The Time Machine_, just mentioned, with\r\nits invasions of the unknown space and time, its trips into eternity\r\nby the agency of a miraculous vehicle, illustrates the method. The\r\nscientist finds that he can travel backwards or forwards, accelerating\r\nor retarding his speed as he will, and get a section of life in any age\r\nhe wishes. He discovers that in the future which he visits many reforms\r\nhave been inaugurated, preventive medicine established, noxious weeds\r\neradicated, and yet strange conditions exist. Mankind has undergone\r\na two-fold involution, the soft conditions of life having caused the\r\nhigher classes to degenerate into flabby beings of no strength, while\r\nan underground race has grown up of horrible depraved nature, blind\r\nfrom living in subterranean passages, cannibalistic while the others\r\nare vegetarian. The lower classes are like hideous apes, while the\r\nhigher are effeminate, relaxed. The traveler escapes a dire fate only\r\nby rushing to his machine and returning to his own time. Samuel Butler\r\nsuggests that machines will be the real rulers in the coming ages, that\r\nman will be preserved only to feed and care for the machines which\r\nwill have attained supernatural sensibility and power. He says that\r\nmechanisms will acquire feelings and tastes and culture, and that man\r\nwill be the servant of steel and steam in the future, instead of master\r\nas now; that engines will wed and rear families which men, as slaves,\r\nmust wait upon.\r\n\r\nFrank R. Stockton[197] gives another supernatural scientific glimpse\r\ninto the future, showing as impossibilities certain things that have\r\nsince come to pass, while some of the changes prophesied as imminent\r\nare yet unrealized and apparently far from actualities. Jack London's\r\n_Scarlet Plague_ pictures the earth returned to barbarism, since most\r\nof the inhabitants have been swept away by a scourge and the others\r\nhave failed to carry on the torch of civilization. H. G. Wells[198]\r\ngives account of a tour into futurity, wherein the miracles of modern\r\nscience work revolutions in human life, and[199] he satirizes society,\r\nshowing a topsy-turvy state of affairs in A.D. 2100. His _Dream of\r\nArmageddon_ is a story of futurity wherein a man has continuous\r\nvisions of what his experiences will be in another life far in the\r\nfuture. That life becomes more real to him than his actual existence,\r\nand he grows indifferent to events taking place around him while\r\nrent with emotion over the griefs to come in another age. Of course,\r\nEdward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_, with its social and mechanistic\r\nmiracles that now seem flat and tame to us, might be said to be the\r\nfather of most of these modern prophecies of scientific futurity.\r\nSamuel Butler's _Erewhon_ contains many elements of impossibility in\r\nrelation to life, and is a satire on society, though perhaps not,\r\nstrictly speaking, supernatural. These prophecies of the time to come\r\nare in the main intended as social satires, as symbolic analyses of\r\nthe weaknesses of present life. They evince vivid imagination and much\r\ningenuity in contriving the mechanisms that are to transform life, yet\r\nthey are not examples of great fiction. Mark Twain reverses the type\r\nin his _Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court_, for he shows a\r\nman of the present taking part in the life of the far past, managing\r\nto parody both mediævalism and the Yankee character at once. H. G.\r\nWells is particularly interested in studying the unused forces of the\r\nworld and fancying what would happen under other conditions. His play\r\nof scientific speculation has produced many stories that he does not\r\ngreatly value now himself, but which are of interest as showing certain\r\ntendencies of fiction.\r\n\r\n      [197] In _The Great Stone of Sardis_.\r\n\r\n      [198] In _A Story of Days to Come_.\r\n\r\n      [199] In _When the Sleeper Wakes_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nViews of other planets form a feature of modern supernaturalism, for\r\nthe writer now sets his stories not only on earth, in heaven, and in\r\nhell but on other worlds besides. The astrologer of ancient fiction,\r\nwith his eye fixed ever on the stars, seeking to discern their\r\ninfluence on human destiny, appears no more among us. He has been\r\nreplaced by the astronomer who scans the stars yet with a different\r\npurpose in fiction. He wishes to find out the life of citizens of\r\nother planets rather than to figure out the fate of mortals on the\r\nearth. Many stories of modern times cause new planets to swim into our\r\nliterary ken and describe their citizens with ease. H. G. Wells stars\r\nhere as elsewhere. In his _War of the Worlds_ he depicts a struggle\r\nbetween the earth people and the Martians, in which many supernatural\r\nelements enter. The people of Mars are a repulsive horde of creatures,\r\nyet they have wonderful organization and command of resources, and\r\nthey conquer the earth to prey upon it. This book has suffered the\r\ninevitable parody.[200] In _The Crystal Egg_, Wells describes a curious\r\nglobe in which the gazer can see scenes reflected from Mars. The author\r\nsuggests two theories as to the possibility of this,--either that\r\nthe crystal is in both worlds at once, remaining stationary in one\r\nand moving in the other, and that it reflects scenes in Mars so that\r\nthey are visible on earth, or else that by a peculiar sympathy with\r\na companion globe on the other planet it shows on its surface what\r\nhappens in the other world. It is hinted that the Martians have sent\r\nthe crystal to the earth in order that they might catch glimpses of our\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n      [200] In _The War of the Wenuses_, by C. L. Graves and E. V.\r\n      Lucas.\r\n\r\nIn _The Star_, Wells gives yet another story of the future, of other\r\nplanetary influences. By the passing of a strange star, life on earth\r\nis convulsed and conditions radically changed. These conditions are\r\nobserved by the astronomers on Mars, who are beings different from\r\nmen, yet very intelligent. They draw conclusions as to the amount of\r\ndamage done to the earth, satirizing human theories as to Mars. _The\r\nDays of the Comet_ shows earthly life changed by the passing of a\r\ncomet, but instead of the destruction described in the other story, the\r\nsocial conditions are vastly improved and a millennium is ushered in.\r\nWells[201] makes a voyage to the moon possible by the discovery of a\r\nsubstance which resists gravity. Other instances might be given, for\r\nthere has been no lack of lunar literature, but they are not usually\r\nworth much.\r\n\r\n      [201] In _The First Men in the Moon_.\r\n\r\nDu Maurier's _The Martian_, which combines the elements of\r\nmetempsychosis, automatic writing, and dream-supernaturalism, with the\r\nidea of ghostly astronomy, tells of a supernatural visitant from Mars.\r\nThe Martian is a young woman whose spirit comes to inhabit a young\r\nman to whom she dictates wonderful books in his dreams. She writes\r\nletters to him in a sort of private code, in which she tells of her\r\nprevious incarnations on Mars, of the Martians who are extraordinary\r\namphibious beings, descended from a small sea animal. They have unusual\r\nacuteness of senses with an added sixth sense, a sort of orientation,\r\na feeling of a magnetic current, which she imparts to her protégé,\r\nBarty Joscelyn. Jack London[202] tells a story of interplanetary\r\nmetempsychosis, where the central character, a prisoner in San Quentin,\r\nfinds himself able to will his body to die at times, thus releasing\r\nhis spirit to fly through space and relive its experiences in previous\r\nincarnations.\r\n\r\n      [202] In _The Star Rover_.\r\n\r\nBarry Pain's _The Celestial Grocery_ is a phantasy of insanity and the\r\nsupernatural, with its setting on two planets. It contains a cab horse\r\nthat talks and laughs, and other inversions of the natural. A man is\r\ntaken on a journey to another world, sees the stars and the earth in\r\nspace beneath him, and finds everything different from what he has\r\nknown before. People there have two bodies and send them alternately\r\nto the wash, though they seldom wear them. The celestial shop sells\r\nnothing concrete, only abstractions, emotions, experiences. One may\r\nbuy measures of love, requited or unselfishly hopeless, of political\r\nsuccess, of literary fame, or of power or what-not. Happiness is a\r\nblend, however, for which one must mix the ingredients for himself. The\r\nstory is symbolic of the ideals of earth, with a sad, effective satire.\r\nThe end is insanity, leaving one wondering how much of it is pure\r\nphantasy of a mad man's brain or how much actuality. It is reminiscent\r\nof Hawthorne's Intelligence Office with its symbolic supernaturalism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHypnotism enters largely into the fiction of modern times. Hypnotism\r\nmay or may not be considered as supernatural, yet it borders so closely\r\non to the realm of the uncanny, and is so related to science of to-day\r\nas well as to the sorcery of the past, that it should be considered in\r\nthis connection for it carries on the traditions of the supernatural.\r\nIn its earlier stages hypnotism was considered as distinctly diabolic,\r\nused only for unlawful purposes, being associated with witchcraft. It\r\nis only in more recent times that it has been rehabilitated in the\r\npublic mind and thought of as a science which may be used for helpful\r\nends. It is so mysterious in its power that it affords complications\r\nin plenty for the novelist and has been utilized in various ways.\r\nIn some cases, as F. Marion Crawford's _The Witch of Prague_, it is\r\nassociated still with evil power and held as a black art. Unorna has an\r\nunearthly power gained through hypnotism which is more than hypnotic,\r\nand which she uses to further her own ends. Strange scientific ideas of\r\nlife and of death are seen here, and someone says of her: \"You would\r\nmake a living mummy of a man. I should expect to find him with his\r\nhead cut off and living by means of a glass heart and thinking through\r\na rabbit's brain.\" She embalms an old man in a continuous hypnotic\r\nlethargy, recalling him only at intervals to do mechanically the things\r\nnecessary to prolong life. She is trying to see if she can cause human\r\ntissue to live forever in this embalmed state, hoping to learn through\r\nit the secret of eternal life. This, of course, suggests Poe's stories\r\nof the subject, _Mesmeric Revelations_ and _The Facts in the Case of\r\nM. Waldemar_. The latter is one of the most revolting instances of\r\nscientific supernaturalism, for the dying man is mesmerized in the\r\nmoment of death and remains in that condition, dead, yet undecaying,\r\nand speaking, repeating with his horrible tongue the statement, \"I am\r\ndead.\" After seven months, further experiments break the spell, and\r\nhe, pleading to be allowed to be at peace in death, falls suddenly\r\naway into a loathsome, liquid putrescence before the eyes of the\r\nexperimenters.\r\n\r\n_The Portent_, by George MacDonald, is a curious study of hypnotic\r\ninfluence, of a woman who is her true self only when in a\r\nsomnambulistic state. A supernatural connection of soul exists between\r\nher and a youth born on the same day, and it is only through his\r\nhypnotic aid that she gains her personality and sanity. James L. Ford\r\nplays with the subject by having a group of persons in an evening party\r\nsubmit themselves to be hypnotized in turn, each telling a true story\r\nof his life while in that condition. W. D. Howells combines mesmerism\r\nwith spiritualism in his novel,[203] where the séances are really the\r\nresult of hypnotism rather than supernatural revelation as the medium\r\nthinks. H. G. Wells has used this theme, as almost every other form of\r\nscientific ghostliness, though without marked success. The prize story\r\nof hypnotism, however, still remains Du Maurier's _Trilby_, for no\r\nmesmerist in this fiction has been able to outdo Svengali.\r\n\r\n      [203] _The Undiscovered Country._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUncanny chemistry forms the ingredient for many a modern story. The\r\nalchemist was the favored feature of the older supernatural fiction of\r\nscience, and his efforts to discover the philosopher's stone and to\r\nbrew the magic elixir have furnished plots for divers stories. He does\r\nnot often waste his time in these vain endeavors in recent stories,\r\nthough his efforts have not altogether ceased, as we have seen in a\r\nprevious chapter. A. Conan Doyle[204] is among the last to treat the\r\ntheme, and makes the scientist find his efforts worse than useless,\r\nfor the research student finds that his discovery of the art of making\r\ngold is disturbing the nice balance of nature and bringing injury to\r\nthose he meant to help, so he destroys his secret formula and dies.\r\n_The Elixir of Youth_ illustrates the transference of power from the\r\nsorcerer to the scientist, for the magician that gives the stranger a\r\npotion to restore his youth tells him that he is not a sorcerer, not a\r\ndiabolic agent, but a scientist learning to utilize the forces that are\r\nat the command of any intelligence.\r\n\r\n      [204] In _The Doings of Raffles Haw_.\r\n\r\nBarry Pain's _The Love Philter_ is related both to the old and the new\r\ntypes of supernatural chemistry. A man loves a woman who doesn't care,\r\nso he asks aid of a wise woman, who gives him a potion that will surely\r\nwin the stubborn heart. As he lies asleep in the desert, on his way\r\nback, he dreams that his love says to him that love gained by such\r\nmeans is not love, so he pours the liquid on the sand. When he returns,\r\nthe woman tells him that she has been with him in his dreams and loves\r\nhim because he would not claim her wrongly. _Blue Roses_ is another of\r\nhis stories of magic that bring love to the indifferent. _Twilight_,\r\nby Frank Danby, is a novel based on the relation between morphia and\r\nthe supernatural. A woman ill of nervous trouble, under the influence\r\nof opiates, continually sees the spirit of a woman dead for years,\r\nwho relives her story before her eyes, so that the personalities are\r\ncuriously merged. This inevitably suggests De Quincey's _Confessions of\r\nan English Opium-Eater_ with its dream-wonders, yet it has a power of\r\nits own and the skillful blending of reality with dream-supernaturalism\r\nand insanity has an uncanny distinction.\r\n\r\nFu-Manchu, the Chinese wonder-worker in Sax Rohmer's series of\r\nstories bearing that name, is a representative example of the modern\r\nuse of chemistry for supernormal effect. He employs all the forces\r\nof up-to-the-minute science to compass his diabolic ends and works\r\nmiracles of chemistry by seemingly natural methods. By a hypodermic\r\ninjection he can instantly drive a man to acute insanity incurable save\r\nby a counter-injection which only Fu-Manchu can give, but which as\r\ninstantly restores the reason. By another needle he can cause a person\r\nto die--to all intents and purposes, at least,--and after the body has\r\nbeen buried for days he can restore it to life by another prick of the\r\nneedle. He terrorizes England by his infernal powers, killing off or\r\nconverting to slavery the leading intelligences that oppose him.\r\n\r\nStevenson's _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ is perhaps the best-known\r\ninstance of chemical supernaturalism. Here the magic drug not only\r\nchanges the body, evolving from the respectable Dr. Jekyll his baser\r\nself in the form of Mr. Hyde, enabling him to give rein to his criminal\r\ninstincts without bringing reproach on his reputation, but has the\r\nsubtle power to fix the personality of evil, so that each time the drug\r\nis used Hyde is given a stronger force and Jekyll is weakened. This\r\nfictive sermon on dual nature, the ascendence of evil over the nobler\r\nsoul if it be indulged, seems yet an appallingly real story of human\r\nlife. In a similar fashion Arthur Machen uses supernatural chemistry\r\nmost hideously in _The Three Impostors_, where a certain powder\r\nperverts the soul, making man a sharer in the unspeakable orgies of\r\nancient evil forces.\r\n\r\n_The Invisible Man_, by H. G. Wells, shows an unusual application of\r\nchemistry to ghostly fiction that gives a peculiar effect of reality\r\nbecause its style is that of scientific realism. By experimentation\r\nwith drugs a man finds a combination that will render living tissue\r\nabsolutely invisible. When he swallows a portion of it, he cannot be\r\nseen. His clothes appear to be walking around by themselves and the\r\ncomplications are uncanny. As one may see, the comic possibilities\r\nare prominent and for a time we laugh over the mystification of the\r\npersons with whom he comes in contact, but soon stark tragedy results.\r\nDuring the man-chase, as the hunted creature seeks to escape, the\r\npeople hear the thud-thud of running steps, watch bloody footprints\r\nform before their eyes, yet see nothing else. Here is a genuine thrill\r\nthat is new in fiction. The man gradually becomes visible, but only in\r\ndeath is his dreadful figure seen completely again. This modern method\r\nof transferring to science the idea of invisibility so prominent in\r\nconnection with ghosts, showing the invisibility as the result of a\r\nchemical compound, not of supernatural intervention, affecting a living\r\nman not a spirit, makes the effect of supernaturalism more vivid even\r\nthan in the case of ghosts.\r\n\r\nThese are only suggestions of the varied uses to which chemistry has\r\nbeen put in producing ghostly plots and utilizing in novel ways the\r\nconventional motifs of older stories. These themes are more popular now\r\nthan they would have been half a century ago because now the average\r\nreader knows more about scientific facts and is better prepared to\r\nappreciate them. A man ignorant of chemistry would care nothing for the\r\nthroes of Dr. Jekyll or the complicating experiences of the invisible\r\nman, because he would have slight basis for his imagination to build\r\nupon. Each widening of the popular intelligence and each branch of\r\nscience added to the mental store of the ordinary reader is a distinct\r\ngain to fiction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSupernatural biology looms large in modern fiction, though it is not\r\nalways easy to differentiate between the predominance of chemical and\r\nbiological motifs. In many cases the two are tangled up together, and\r\nas, in the stories of dual personality and invisibility just mentioned,\r\none may not readily say which is uppermost, the biological or the\r\nchemical side, for the experiments are of the effects of certain drugs\r\nupon living human tissue. There are various similar instances in the\r\nfiction of scientific supernaturalism. Hawthorne's _The Birthmark_ is\r\na case of chemical biology, where the husband seeking to remove by\r\npowerful drugs the mark from his wife's cheek succeeds in doing so\r\nbut causes her death. Here the supernaturalism is symbolic, suggested\r\nrather than boldly stated, as is usually the case with Hawthorne's work.\r\n\r\nA. Conan Doyle in _The Los Amigos Fiasco_ shows supernaturalism based\r\non the effect of electricity on the body, for the lynchers in trying to\r\nkill a man by connecting him with a dynamo succeed in so magnetizing\r\nhim that he can't be killed in any way. Sax Rohmer tells one Fu-Manchu\r\nstory of a mysterious murder committed by means of an imprisoned gas\r\nthat escapes from a mummy case and poisons those exposed to it, and, in\r\nanother, he introduces a diabolic red insect attracted by the scent of\r\na poisonous orchid, that bites the marked victim.\r\n\r\nWells's _The Island of Dr. Moreau_ is a ghastly study in vivisection.\r\nTwo scientists on a remote island with no other human inhabitants try\r\nunspeakable experiments on animals, trying by pruning and grafting and\r\ntraining the living tissue to make them human. They do succeed in a\r\nmeasure, for they teach the beasts to talk and to observe a sort of\r\njungle law laid down by man, yet the effect is sickening. The animals\r\nare not human and never can be, and these revolting experiments deprive\r\nthem of all animal dignity without adding any of the human. In the end\r\nthey revert to savagery, becoming even more bestial than before. The\r\nmost dreadful biological experiments in recent fiction are described in\r\nArthur Machen's volume of short stories, _The House of Souls_. In one\r\nstory an operation on the brain enables a victim to \"see the great god\r\nPan,\" to have revelations of ancient supernaturalism wherein Pan and\r\nthe devil are united in one character. In another, a delicate cutting\r\nof the brain removes the soul,--which takes the form of a wonderful\r\njewel,--and utterly diabolizes the character. These curious and\r\nrevolting stories are advanced instances of scientific diabolism and\r\nleave a smear on the mind. They are more horrible than the creation of\r\nFrankenstein's man-monster, for here moral monsters are evolved.\r\n\r\nMedicated supernaturalism associated with prenatal influence occurs\r\nin various stories where a supernormal twist is given because of some\r\nevent out of the ordinary. Ambrose Bierce's _The Eyes of the Panther_,\r\na story of a young woman who is a panther for part of the time as a\r\nresult of a shock, is associated with the snake nature of Elsie Venner.\r\nBarry Pain's _The Undying Thing_ is one of the most horrible of such\r\ncomplications, for because of a mother's fright over a pack of wolves\r\na monster is born, neither wolf nor human, neither animal nor man,\r\nneither mortal nor immortal. It is hidden in a secret cave to die,\r\nyet lives on, though not living, to fulfil a curse upon the ancient\r\nhouse. A. Conan Doyle's _The Terror of Blue John Gap_ is a story of a\r\nmonstrous animal, like a bear yet bigger than an elephant, that ravages\r\nthe countryside. The theory for its being is that it is a survival, in\r\na subterranean cave, of a long-extinct type, from prehistoric times,\r\nthat comes out in its blindness to destroy. There are other examples of\r\nsupernormal animals in modern fiction, yet these suffice to illustrate\r\nthe _genre_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBotany furnishes its ghostly plots in fiction as well as other branches\r\nof science, for we have plant vampires and witches and devils. Trees\r\nand flowers are highly psychic and run a gamut of emotions. Hawthorne\r\nshows us supernatural plants in several of his novels and stories,\r\nsuch as the mysterious plant growing from a secret grave, which has a\r\nstrange poisonous power, or the flowers from Gaffer Dolliver's garden\r\nthat shine like jewels and lend a glow to the living face near them,\r\nwhen worn on a woman's breast. In _Rappaccini's Daughter_ the garden\r\nis full of flowers of subtle poison, so insidious that their venom\r\nhas entered into the life of the young girl, rendering her a living\r\nmenace to those around her. She is the victim of her father's dæmonic\r\nexperiments in the effects of poison on the human body, and her kiss\r\nmeans death. Algernon Blackwood[205] tells of the uncanny power of\r\nmotion and emotion possessed by the trees, where the forest exercises a\r\nmagnetic force upon human beings sympathetic to them, going out after\r\nmen and luring them to their fate. He describes the cedar as friendly\r\nto man and attempting but in vain to protect him from the creeping\r\nmalignant power of the forest.\r\n\r\n      [205] In _The Man whom the Trees Loved_.\r\n\r\nFu-Manchu, Sax Rohmer's Chinese horror, performs various experiments\r\nin botany to further his dreadful ends. He develops a species of\r\npoisonous fungi till they become giant in size and acquire certain\r\npowers through being kept in the darkness. When a light is turned on\r\nthem, the fungi explode, turning loose, on the men he would murder,\r\nfumes that drive them mad. From the ceiling above are released ripe\r\nspores of the giant Empusa, for the air in the second cellar, being\r\nsurcharged with oxygen, makes them germinate instantly. They fall like\r\npowdered snow upon the victims and the horrible fungi grow magically,\r\nspreading over the writhing bodies of the mad-men and wrapping them\r\nin ghostly shrouds. In _The Flower of Silence_ he describes a strange\r\norchid that has the uncanny habit of stinging or biting when it is\r\nbroken or roughly handled, sending forth a poison that first makes a\r\nman deaf then kills him. Fu-Manchu introduces this flower into the\r\nsleeping-rooms of those he wishes to put out of the way, and sends them\r\ninto eternal silence. _The Flowering of the Strange Orchid_, by H. G.\r\nWells, is the story of a murderous plant, a vampire that kills men in\r\nthe jungle, and in a greenhouse in England sends out its tentacles\r\nthat grip the botanist, drinking his blood and seeking to slay him.\r\nThis orchid has the power to project its vampiric attacks when it\r\nis a shriveled bulb or in the flower. This reminds us of Algernon\r\nBlackwood's story of the vampire soil, which after its psychic orgy\r\nburst into loathsome luxuriant bloom where before it had been barren.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious heightening of supernatural effect to give to beautiful\r\nflowers diabolical cunning and murderous motives, to endow them with\r\nhuman psychology and devilish designs. The magic associated with botany\r\nis usually black instead of white. One wonders if transmigration of\r\nsoul does not enter subconsciously into these plots, and if a vampire\r\norchid is not a trailing off of a human soul, the murderous blossom\r\na revenge ghost expressing himself in that way. The plots in this\r\ntype of fiction are wrought with much imagination and the scientific\r\nexactness combined with the supernatural gives a peculiar effect of\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are varied forms of supernatural science that do not come under\r\nany of the heads discussed. The applications of research to weird\r\nfiction are as diverse as the phases of investigation and only a few\r\nmay be mentioned to suggest the variety of themes employed. Inversion\r\nof natural laws furnishes plots,--as in Frank R. Stockton's _Tale of\r\nNegative Gravity_ with its discovery of a substance that enables a man\r\nto save himself all fatigue by means of a something that inverts the\r\nlaw of gravity. With a little package in his pocket a man can climb\r\nmountains without effort, but the discoverer miscalculates the amount\r\nof energy required to move and finally rises instead of staying on the\r\nearth, till his wife has to fish him into the second-story window.\r\nPoe's _Loss of Breath_ illustrates another infringement of a natural\r\nlaw, as do several stories where a human being loses his shadow.\r\n\r\nIn _The Diamond Lens_, Fitz-James O'Brien tells of a man who looking\r\nat a drop of water through a giant microscope sees in the drop a\r\nlovely woman with whom he falls madly in love, only to watch her fade\r\naway under the lens as his despairing eyes see the water evaporate.\r\nSupernatural acoustics enters[206] in the story of a man who discovers\r\nthe sound-center in an opera house and reads the unspoken thoughts\r\nof those around him. He applies the laws of acoustics to mentality\r\nand spirituality, making astounding discoveries. Bram Stoker combines\r\nsuperstition with modern science in his books, as[207] where Oriental\r\nmagic is used to fight the encroachments of an evil force emanating\r\nfrom a mummy, as also to bring the mummy to life, while a respirator is\r\nemployed to keep away the subtle odor. He brings in blood transfusion\r\ntogether with superstitious symbols, to combat the ravages of\r\nvampires.[208] Blood transfusion also enters into supernaturalism in\r\nStephen French Whitney's story, where a woman who has been buried in a\r\nglacier for two thousand years is recalled to life.\r\n\r\n      [206] In _The Spider's Eye_, by Lucretia P. Hale.\r\n\r\n      [207] In _The Jewel of Seven Stars_.\r\n\r\n      [208] In _Dracula_.\r\n\r\n_The Human Chord_, by Algernon Blackwood, is a novel based on the\r\npsychic values of sounds, which claims that sounds are all powerful,\r\nare everything,--for forms, shapes, bodies are but vibratory activities\r\nof sound made visible. The research worker here believes that he who\r\nhas the power to call a thing by its proper name is master of that\r\nthing, or of that person, and that to be able to call the name of Deity\r\nwould be to enable one to become as God. He seeks to bring together\r\na human chord, four persons in harmony as to voice and soul, who can\r\npronounce the awful name and become divine with him. He can change\r\nthe form or the nature of anything by calling its name, as a woman is\r\ndeformed by mispronunciation, and the walls of a room expanded by his\r\nvoice. He can make of himself a dwarf or a giant at will, by different\r\nmethods of speaking his own name. He says that sound could re-create\r\nor destroy the universe. He has captured sounds that strain at their\r\nleashes in his secret rooms, gigantic, wonderful. But in the effort\r\nto call upon the mighty Name he mispronounces it, bringing a terrible\r\nconvulsion of nature which destroys him. The beholders see an awful\r\nfire in which Letters escape back to heaven in chariots of flame.\r\n\r\nPsychology furnishes some interesting contributions to recent fiction\r\nalong the line of what might be called momentary or instantaneous\r\nplots. Ambrose Bierce's _The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge_ is a good\r\nexample,--where a man is being hanged and in the instant between the\r\ndrop from the bridge and the breaking of the neck he lives through\r\nlong and dramatic adventures, escaping his pursuers by falling into\r\nthe river and swimming ashore, reaching home at last to greet his\r\nwife and children. Yet in a second his lifeless body swings from the\r\nbridge. _The Warning_, by Josephine Daskam Bacon, shows the case of a\r\nman who lives years in another country during a few moments of acute\r\nmental strain carried to the point of paranoia. Barry Pain has a story\r\nwhere in the time in which a man drives home from the theater he visits\r\nanother planet and changes the current of his life, while Algernon\r\nBlackwood compresses a great experience into a few minutes of dreaming.\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy point in connection with the scientific supernaturalism\r\nis that these themes appear only in novels and short stories. They do\r\nnot cross over into poetry as do most of the other forms of the ghostly\r\nart. Perhaps this is because the situations are intellectual rather\r\nthan emotional, brain-problems or studies in mechanisms rather than in\r\nfeelings or emotions. The province of science is removed from that of\r\npoetry because the methods and purposes are altogether different. The\r\nscientific methods are clear-cut, coldly intellectual. Science demands\r\nan exactness, a meticulous accuracy hostile to poetry which requires\r\nsuggestion, vagueness, veiled mystery for its greatest effect. _The\r\nFlower of Silence_, for instance, would be a fitting title for a poem,\r\nbut the poetic effect would be destroyed by the need for stating the\r\ngenus and species of the orchid and analyzing its destruction of human\r\ntissue. Nature's mysterious forces and elements in general and vaguely\r\nconsidered, veiled in mists of imagination and with a sense of vastness\r\nand beauty, are extremely poetic. But the notebook and laboratory\r\nmethods of pure science are antagonistic to poetry, though they fit\r\nadmirably into the requirements of fiction, whose purpose is to give an\r\nimpression of actuality.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why these scientific themes do not pass over into poetry\r\nmay be that scientific methods as we know them are new, and poetry\r\nclings to the old and established conventions and emotions. There\r\nis amazing human interest in these experiments, a veritable wealth\r\nof romance, with dramatic possibilities tragic and comic, yet they\r\nare more suited to prose fiction than to poetry. We have adapted our\r\nbrain-cells to their concepts in prose, yet we have not thus molded our\r\npoetic ideas. It gives us a shock to have new concepts introduced into\r\npoetry. An instance of this clash of realism with sentiment is shown in\r\na recent poem where the setting is a physics laboratory. Yet in a few\r\nmore decades we may find the poets eagerly converting the raw materials\r\nof science into the essence of poetry itself, and by a mystic alchemy\r\nmore wonderful than any yet known, transmuting intellectual problems of\r\nscience into magic verse. _Creation_, by Alfred Noyes, is an impressive\r\ndiscussion of evolution as related to God.\r\n\r\nPerhaps another reason why these themes have not been utilized in\r\npoetry is because they are too fantastic, too bizarre. They lack\r\nthe proportion and sense of artistic harmony that poetry requires.\r\nStrangeness and wonder are true elements of poetry, and magic is\r\nan element of the greatest art, but in solution as it were, not in\r\nthe form observed in science. The miracles of the laboratory are\r\ntoo abrupt, too inconceivable save by intellectual analysis, and\r\npresent too great a strain upon the powers of the imagination. They\r\nare fantastic, while true poetry is concerned with the fancy. Magic\r\nand wonder in verse must come from concepts that steal upon the\r\nimagination and make appeal through the emotions. Thus some forms of\r\nsupernaturalism are admirably adapted to the province of poetry,\r\nsuch as the presence of spirits, visitations of angels or demons,\r\nancient witchcraft, and so forth. The elements that have universal\r\nappeal through the sense of the supernatural move us in poetry, but\r\nthe isolated instances, the peculiar problems that occur in scientific\r\nresearch if transferred to poetry would leave us cold. Yet they may\r\ncome to be used in the next _vers libre_.\r\n\r\nNor do these situations come over into the drama save in rare\r\ninstances. Theodore Dreiser, in a recent volume, _Plays of the Natural\r\nand the Supernatural_, makes use of certain motifs that are striking\r\nand modern, as[209] where a physician goes on the operating-table,\r\nthe _dramatis personæ_ including Demyaphon (Nitrous Acid), and\r\nAlcepheron (a Power of Physics), as well as several Shadows, mysterious\r\npersonages of vagueness. These Shadows here, as in _The Blue Sphere_,\r\nare not altogether clear as to motivation, yet they seem to stand for\r\nFate interference in human destiny. In the latter play Fate is also\r\nrepresented by a Fast Mail which is one of the active characters,\r\nmenacing and destroying a child.\r\n\r\n      [209] In _Laughing Gas_.\r\n\r\nOne reason why these motifs of science are not used in drama to any\r\nextent is that they are impossible of representation on the stage.\r\nEven the wizardry of modern producers would be unable to show a Power\r\nof Physics, or Nitrous Acid, save as they might be embodied, as were\r\nthe symbolic characters in Maeterlinck's _Blue Bird_, which would mean\r\nthat they would lose their effect. And what would a stage manager do\r\nwith the rhythm of the universe, which enters into Dreiser's play? Many\r\nsounds can be managed off stage, but hardly that, one fancies. These\r\nthemes are not even found in closet drama, where many other elements of\r\nsupernaturalism which would be difficult or impossible of presentation\r\non the stage trail off. William Sharp's _Vistas_, for instance, could\r\nnot be shown on the stage, yet the little plays in that volume are\r\nof wonderful dramatic power. The drama can stand a good deal of\r\nsupernaturalism of various kinds, from the visible ghosts and devils\r\nof the Elizabethans to the atmospheric supernaturalism of Maeterlinck,\r\nbut it could scarcely support the presentations of chemicals and gases\r\nand supernatural botany and biology that fiction handles with ease. The\r\nmiraculous machinery would balk at stage action. Fancy the Time Machine\r\nstaged, for instance!\r\n\r\nWe notice in these scientific stories a widening of the sphere of\r\nsupernatural fiction. It is extended to include more of the normal\r\ninterests and activities of man than has formerly been the case. Here\r\nwe notice a spirit similar to that of the leveling influence seen\r\nin the case of the ghosts, devils, witches, angels, and so forth,\r\nwho have been made more human not only in appearance but in emotions\r\nand activities as well. Likewise these scientific elements have been\r\nelevated to the human. Supernatural as well as human attributes have\r\nbeen extended to material things, as animals are given supernormal\r\npowers in a sense different from and yet similar to those possessed by\r\nthe enchanted animals in folk-lore. Science has its physical as well as\r\npsychic horrors which the scientific ghostly tales bring in.\r\n\r\nNot only are animals gifted with supernatural powers but plants as\r\nwell are humanized, diabolized. We have strange murderous trees,\r\nvampire orchids, flowers that slay men in secret ways with all the\r\nsmiling loveliness of a treacherous woman. The dæmonics of modern\r\nbotany form an interesting phase of ghostly fiction and give a new\r\nthrill to supernaturalism. Inanimate, concrete things are endowed with\r\nunearthly cunning and strength, as well as animals and plants. The new\r\ntype of fiction gives to chemicals and gases a hellish intelligence, a\r\ndiabolic force of minds. It creates machinery and gives it an excess\r\nof force, a supernatural, more than human cunning, sometimes helpful,\r\nsometimes dæmonic. Machines have been spiritualized and some engines\r\nare philanthropic while some are like damned souls.\r\n\r\nThis scientific supernaturalism concerns itself with mortal life, not\r\nwith immortality as do some of the other aspects of the _genre_. It is\r\nconcrete in its effects, not spiritual. Its incursions into futurity\r\nare earthly, not of heaven or hell, and its problems are of time, not\r\nof eternity. The form shows how clear, cold intelligence plays with\r\nmiracles and applies the supernatural to daily life. The enthusiasm,\r\nwild and exaggerated in some ways, that sprang up over the prospects\r\nof what modern science and investigation would almost immediately do\r\nfor the world in the latter half of the nineteenth century, had no\r\nmore interesting effect than in the stimulating of scientific fictive\r\nsupernaturalism. And though mankind has learned that science will not\r\nimmediately bring the millennium, science still exercises a strong\r\npower over fiction. This type shows a strange effect of realism in\r\nsupernaturalism, because of the scientific methods, for supernaturalism\r\nimposed on material things produces an effect of verisimilitude not\r\ngained in the realm of pure spirit. Too intellectually cold for the\r\npurposes of poetry, too abstract and elusive for presentation in\r\ndrama, and too removed by its association with the fantastic aspects\r\nof investigation and the curiosities of science to be very appropriate\r\nfor tragedy, which has hitherto been the chief medium of expressing\r\nthe dramatic supernatural, science finds its fitting expression in\r\nprose fiction. It is an illustration of the widening range of the\r\nsupernatural in fiction and as such is significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters I have endeavored to show the continuance\r\nand persistence of the supernatural in English fiction, as well as in\r\nother forms of literature, and to give some idea of the variety of its\r\nmanifestations. There has been no period in our history from Beowulf\r\nto the present when the ghostly was not found in our literature. Of\r\ncourse, there have been periods when the interest in it waned, yet\r\nit has never been wholly absent. There is at the present a definite\r\nrevival of interest in the supernatural appearing in the drama, in\r\npoetry and in fiction, evident to anyone who has carefully studied\r\nthe recent publications and magazines. Within the last few years,\r\nespecially in the last two years, an astonishing amount of ghostly\r\nmaterial has appeared. Some of these stories are of the hoax variety,\r\nothers are suggestive, allegorical or symbolic, while others frankly\r\naccept the forces beyond man's mortal life and human dominion. I\r\nhesitate to suggest a reason for this sudden rising tide of occultism\r\nat this particular time, but it seems clear to me that the war\r\nhas had much to do with it. I have found a number of supernatural\r\nproductions directly associated with the struggle. Among them might be\r\nmentioned Katherine Fullerton Gerould's extraordinary, elusive story\r\nof horror[210]; _The Second Coming_, by Frederick Arnold Kummer and\r\nHenry P. Janes, where Christ walks the battlefields on Christmas Eve,\r\npleading with the Kaiser to stop the slaughter of men, but in vain,\r\nand the carnage goes on till Easter, when the Christ stands beside\r\nthe dying Emperor, with the roar of the rioting people heard in the\r\nstreets outside, and softens his heart at last, so that he says, \"Lord,\r\nI have sinned! Give my people peace!\"; Kipling's ghost-story,[211]\r\nwith its specters of children slain by the Germans; _The Gray Guest_,\r\nshowing Napoleon returning to lead the French forces to victory in a\r\ncrisis; _Jeanne, the Maid_ where the spirit of Joan of Arc descends\r\nupon a young French girl of to-day, enabling her to do wonderful things\r\nfor her countrymen; _War Letters from a Living Dead Man_, a series\r\nof professed psychic communications from the other world, by Elsa\r\nBarker; _Real Ghost Stories_, a volume containing a number of stories\r\nby different writers, describing some of the phantoms seen by soldiers\r\non the battlefield; and Arthur Machen's _The Bowmen_, a collection\r\nof striking fictive instances of crowd-supernaturalism associated\r\nwith the war. The last volume affords an interesting glimpse into the\r\nway in which legends are built up, for it is a contemporary legend\r\nin connection with the Angels at Mons. Carl Hauptmann has a striking\r\nplay,[212] showing the use of war-supernaturalism in the drama. When\r\nthe eyes of the world are turned toward the battlefields and death\r\nis an ever-present reality, it is natural that human thoughts occupy\r\nthemselves with visions of a life after death. _Kingdom Come_, by Vida\r\nSutton, shows the spirits of Russian peasants slain for refusing to\r\nfight, specters unaware that they are dead. Various martial heroes\r\nof the past are resurrected to give inspiration in battle in recent\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n      [210] _The Eighty-Third._\r\n\r\n      [211] _Swept and Garnished._\r\n\r\n      [212] _The Dead Are Singing_, in the May, 1916, _Texas Review_.\r\n\r\nBut whatever be the reason for this revival of the ghostly, the\r\nfact remains that this is distinctly the day for the phantom and\r\nhis confrères. While romanticism is always with us, it appears in\r\ndifferent manifestations. A few years ago the swashbuckling hero and\r\nhis adventures seemed the most striking survival of the earlier days\r\nof romanticism, but now the weird and the ghostly have regained a\r\npopularity which they never surpassed even in the heyday of Gothic\r\nfiction. The slashing sword has been displaced by the psychographic\r\npen. The crucial struggles now are occult, rather than adventurous,\r\nas before, and while realism in fiction is immensely popular--never\r\nmore so than now--it is likely to have supernaturalism overlaid upon\r\nit, as in De Morgan's work, to give a single example. Recent poetry\r\nmanifests the same tendency, and likewise the drama, particularly the\r\ncloset drama and the playlet. While literary history shows clearly the\r\ncontinuity of the supernatural, with certain rise and fall of interest\r\nin it at different periods, it is apparent that now there is a more\r\ngeneral fondness for the form than at any other period in English\r\nliterature. The supernatural is in solution and exists everywhere.\r\nRecent poetry shows a strong predilection for the uncanny, sometimes\r\nin the manner of the old ballads, while in other instances the\r\nghostly is treated with a spirit of critical detachment as in Rupert\r\nBrooke's sonnet,[213] or with skepticism as in his sardonic satire on\r\nfaith.[214] In the recent volume of Brooke's collected poems, there\r\nare about a dozen dealing with the supernatural. Maeterlinck expressed\r\nthe feeling that a spiritual epoch is perhaps upon us, as Poe said\r\nthat we are in the midst of great psychal powers. As Francis Thompson\r\nsays in his _Hound of Heaven_, \"Nature, poor step-dame, cannot slake\r\nour drought!\" The interest in certain lines of thought which lead to\r\nthe writing of supernatural fiction, as Spiritualism or folk-lore, or\r\nscience or psychical research, may have the reflex action of arousing\r\ninterest in the subjects themselves. But at all events, there is no\r\nlack of uncanny literature at present.\r\n\r\n      [213] _Suggested by some of the Proceedings of the Society for\r\n      Psychical Research._\r\n\r\n      [214] In his _Heaven_.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the modern supernatural literature as distinguished\r\nfrom that of other periods, is in the matter of length. Of course,\r\nthe ballad and the folk-tale expressed the ghostly in brief form,\r\nbut the epic held the stage longer, while in Elizabethan times the\r\ndrama was the preferred form as in the eighteenth century the Gothic\r\nnovel. During the nineteenth century, particularly the latter half,\r\nthe preference was decidedly for the short story, while more recently\r\nthe one-act play has come into vogue. But in the last few years the\r\nsupernatural novel seems to be returning to favor, though without\r\ndisplacing the shorter forms. Brevity has much to commend it as a\r\nvehicle for the uncanny. The effect of the ghostly may be attained with\r\nmuch more unity in a short story or playlet than in a novel or long\r\ndrama, for in the more lengthy form much outside matter is necessarily\r\nincluded. The whole plot could scarcely be made up of the unearthly,\r\nfor that would mean a weakening of power through exaggeration, though\r\nthis is sometimes found to be the case, as in several of Bram Stoker's\r\nnovels. Recently the number of novels dealing with supernatural themes\r\nhas noticeably increased, which leads one to believe that the occult\r\nis transcending even the limitations of length and claiming all forms\r\nfor its own. Now no literary type bars the supernatural, which appears\r\nin the novel as in the story, in the drama as in the playlet, and in\r\nnarrative, dramatic, and lyric poetry. Even the epic of the more than\r\nmortal has not entirely vanished, as the work of Dr. William Cleaver\r\nWilkinson attests, but popular taste does not really run to epics\r\nnowadays. The ghostly is more often seen in the shorter forms, where\r\nbrevity gives a chance for compression and intensity of force difficult\r\nin longer vehicles. The rise of the one-act play in popular favor is\r\nsignificant in this connection. The short dramas of Synge, Yeats, Lady\r\nGregory, William Sharpe, Gordon Bottomley, and Theodore Dreiser show\r\nthe possibilities of the playlet for weird effect. Maeterlinck's plays\r\nfor marionettes are especially powerful, but the work of Lord Dunsany\r\nfurnishes more peculiar ghostliness than that of any other present\r\ndramatist. His jade idols, for instance, that wake to terrible life\r\nand revenge themselves on presumptuous mortals, are a new touch in\r\ndramatics. Algernon Blackwood is doing more significant work in psychic\r\nfiction than anyone else, his prose showing poetic beauty as well as\r\neerie power.\r\n\r\nAnother significant fact to be noted in connection with the later\r\nghostly stories as compared with the Gothic is in the greater number\r\nand variety of materials employed. The early religious plays had\r\nintroduced devils, angels, and divinity to a considerable extent, while\r\nthe Elizabethan drama relied for its thrills chiefly on the witch and\r\nthe revenge-ghost. The Gothic romance was strong for the ghost, with\r\none or two Wandering Jews, occasional werewolves and lycanthropes,\r\nand sporadic satanity, but made no use of angels or of divinity. The\r\nmodern fiction, however, gathers up all of these personages and puts\r\nthem into service freely. In addition to these old themes brought\r\nup to date and varied astonishingly, the new fiction has adapted\r\nother types. The scientific supernaturalism is practically new--save\r\nfor the Gothic employment of alchemy and astrology--and now all the\r\ndiscoveries and investigations of the laboratory are utilized and\r\nembued with supernaturalism. Diabolic botany, psychological chemistry,\r\nand supermortal biology appear in recent fiction. The countless arts\r\nand sciences, acoustics, optics, dietetics, and what-not are levied\r\non for plots, while astronomy shows us wonders the astrologer never\r\ndreamed of. The stars knew their place and kept it in early romance,\r\nbut they are given to strange aberration and unaccountable conduct in\r\nlate narration.\r\n\r\nThe futuristic fiction gives us return trips into time to come,\r\nwhile we may be transported into the far past, as with Mark Twain's\r\nConnecticut Yankee that visits King Arthur's Court. The extent to\r\nwhich a homespun realist like Mark Twain uses the supernatural is\r\nsignificant. No province or small corner of science has failed to\r\nfurnish material for the new ghostly fiction, and even the Fourth and\r\nFifth Dimensions are brought in as plot complications. Microscopes are\r\nbewitched, mirrors are enchanted, and science reverses its own laws at\r\nwill to suit the weird demands.\r\n\r\nAnother modern material is the mechanistic. This is the age of\r\nmachinery, and even engines are run by ghost-power. Examples of the\r\nmechanical spook are legion. There is the haunted automobile in\r\nHarriet Prescott Spofford's story, _The Mad Lady_, that reproduces\r\nthrough its speaking tube the long-dead voice, that runs away with its\r\noccupants, reliving previous tragic experiences. A phantom Ford is an\r\nidea combining romanticism with realism surely! In connection with\r\nthis extraordinary car is a house that erects itself out of dreams and\r\nis substantial enough for living purposes. Other specimens are John\r\nKendrick Bangs's enchanted typewriter that clicks off psychograms in\r\nthe dark, between midnight and three o'clock in the morning; Frank\r\nR. Stockton's machine for negativing gravity; Poe's balloon in which\r\nHans Pfaal makes his magic trip to the moon; Wells's new accelerator\r\nthat condenses and intensifies vital energy, enabling a man to crowd\r\nthe forces of a week into an hour of emergency, as likewise his time\r\nmachine that permits the inventor to project himself into the future\r\nor the past at will, to spend a week-end in any era. The butterfly\r\nin Hawthorne's story shows the spiritualization of machinery as the\r\npoor artist of the beautiful conceived it, the delicate toy imbibing a\r\nmagnetism, a spiritual essence that gives it life and beauty and power\r\nof voluntary motion. This etherealized machinery is manifest in modern\r\nfiction as well as the diabolic constructions that wreck and ruin.\r\n\r\nInanimate objects have a strange power in later fiction as Poe's ship\r\nthat is said in certain seas to increase in size, as the trees told\r\nof by Algernon Blackwood that grow in the picture. There are various\r\nhaunted portraits, as the picture of Dorian Gray that bears on its\r\nface the lines of sin the living face does not show, and whose hands\r\nare bloodstained when Dorian commits murder; and the painting told\r\nof in De Morgan's _A Likely Story_, that overhears a quarrel between\r\nan artist and his wife, the woman wrongly suspecting her husband\r\nand leaving him. The picture relates the story to a man who has the\r\npainting photographed and a copy sent to the wife. There is the haunted\r\ntapestry[215] that is curiously related to the living and to the long\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n      [215] In Poe's _Metzengerstein_.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the later as distinguished from the earlier occult\r\nliterature is the attention paid to ghostly children. Youngsters are\r\ncoming to the front of the stage everywhere nowadays, particularly in\r\nAmerica, so it is but natural that they should demand to be heard as\r\nwell as seen, in supernatural fiction. In the Gothic ghosts I found no\r\nindividualized children, and children in groups only twice. In one of\r\nJames Hogg's short novels a vicious man is haunted on his death-bed by\r\nthe specters of little ones dead because of him, but they are nameless\r\nand indistinguishable. In Maturin's _The Albigenses_ a relentless\r\npersecutor, while passing through a lonely forest, sees the phantoms of\r\nthose he has done to death, little children and babes at the breast,\r\nas well as men and women. But here again they are not given separable\r\ncharacter, but are merely group figures, hence do not count.\r\n\r\nThere is a ghost-child mentioned in Hawthorne's _Blithedale Romance_,\r\nbut it is not until more recent fiction that children's ghosts enter\r\npersonated and individualized. The exquisitely shy little ones in\r\nKipling's _They_ are among the most wonderful of his child-creations,\r\nvery human and lovable. In a war story,[216] he shows us the phantoms\r\nof several children whom the Germans have killed, natural youngsters\r\nwith appealing childish attributes, especially the small boy with his\r\npride in his first trousers. Arthur Machen[217] tells of a German\r\nsoldier who has crucified a child against the church door and is driven\r\nto insanity by the baby spirit. Quiller-Couch[218] shows the specter\r\nof a little girl that returns at night to do housework for the living,\r\nvisible only as two slender hands, who reminds us of the shepherd boy\r\nRichard Middleton tells of, who having died because of his drunken\r\nfather's neglect, comes back to help him tend the sheep. Algernon\r\nBlackwood relates the story of a little child who has been wont to pray\r\nfor the unquiet ghost of Petavel, a wicked man who haunts his house.\r\nAfter the child is dead, the mother sees the little boy leading Petavel\r\nby the hand, and says, \"He's leading him into peace and safety. Perhaps\r\nthat's why God took him.\"\r\n\r\n      [216] _Swept and Garnished._\r\n\r\n      [217] In _The Monstrance_, another story of the war.\r\n\r\n      [218] In _A Pair of Hands_.\r\n\r\nRichard Middleton's story of a little ghost-boy[219] is poignantly\r\npathetic. The little chap comes back to play with his grieving sister,\r\nmaking his presence known by his gay feet dancing through the bracken,\r\nand his joyous imitations of an automobile's chug-chug. Mary MacMillan\r\nspeaks of the spirits of little children that are \"out earlier at\r\nnight than the older ghosts, you know, because they have to go to bed\r\nearlier, being so young.\" Two very recent child ghosts are Wee Brown\r\nElsbeth whom Frances Hodgson Burnett shows to us, the wraith of a\r\nlittle girl pitifully slain centuries ago by her father to save her\r\nfrom torture, who comes back to play with a living playmate; and the\r\nterrible revenge-ghost of the child slain by her stepfather, who comes\r\nback to cause his death, whom Ellen Glasgow describes.\r\n\r\n      [219] _The Passing of Edward._\r\n\r\nThe spirits of children that never were enter into the late stories,\r\nas in _The Children_, by Josephine Daskam Bacon, a story of confused\r\nparanoia and supernaturalism. A woman grieves over the children she\r\nnever had till they assume personality and being for her. They become\r\nso real that they are finally seen by other children who wish to play\r\nwith them. This reminds us of Thomas Bailey Aldrich's imagined child,\r\nMiss Mehitabel's son. Algernon Blackwood[220] shows us a multitude of\r\nbaby spirits, with reaching arms, pattering steps, and lisping voices,\r\nspirits of the unborn that haunt childless women. The room which they\r\nenter seems sacred with the potentialities of motherhood, so that a\r\nman sleeping there sees his own dead mother return to him among the\r\nbabes. These ghosts of little children that never were and never may be\r\nare like the spirits of the yet to be born children in Maeterlinck's\r\ndream-drama,[221] where, in the Land of the Future, the child-souls\r\nwait for the angel to summon them to life. In these stories associating\r\nchildren with the ghostly there is always a tender pathos, a sad beauty\r\nthat is appealing.\r\n\r\n      [220] In _Clairvoyance_.\r\n\r\n      [221] _The Blue Bird._\r\n\r\nThe spectral insect or animal is another innovation in recent fiction,\r\nthough there have been occasional cases before, as Vergil's _Culex_,\r\nthe story of the ghost of a gnat killed thoughtlessly coming back to\r\ntell its murderer of its sufferings in the insect hades. Robert W.\r\nChambers shows us several ghostly insects, a death's head moth that\r\nis a presager of disaster, and a butterfly that brings a murderer to\r\njustice, while Frederick Swanson in a story[222] makes a spectral\r\ninsect a minister of fate. The most curdling example, however, of the\r\nentomological supernaturalism, is Richard Marsh's novel, _The Beetle_,\r\na modernized version of the ancient superstitions of Egypt, whereby a\r\npriestess of Isis continues her mysterious, horrid life alternately as\r\na human being and as a beetle. This lively scarab has mesmeric, magic\r\npower over mortals and by its sensational shape-shifting furnishes\r\ncomplicating terror to the plot.\r\n\r\n      [222] _The Ghost Moth._\r\n\r\nThe dog is frequently the subject of occult fiction, more so than any\r\nother animal, perhaps because the dog seems more nearly human than any\r\nsave possibly the horse. Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward shows us a\r\ndog very much at home in heaven, while she has a ghost-dog on earth\r\ncoming back to march in a Decoration Day parade beside his master.\r\nIsabel Howe Fisk in a drama shows the Archangel Raphael accompanied by\r\nhis dog, a cavortive canine, not apparently archangelic. Ambrose Bierce\r\nevokes one terrible revenge-ghost, a dog that kills the murderer of his\r\nmaster, while[223] Eden Phillpotts represents a pack of spectral dogs\r\nthat pursue the Evil One over the earth till the Judgment Day, each\r\nbeing a lost soul. A young girl's little unbaptized baby is thought\r\nto be one of the number. Conan Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles\r\nis a terrifying canine of legendary power. Kerfol by Edith Wharton\r\nshows the ghosts of five dogs, each carefully individualized,--a\r\nChinese sleeve-dog, a rough brindled bulldog, a long-haired white\r\nmongrel, a large white pointer with one brown ear, and a small black\r\ngrayhound. These specters of animals that have been killed by a jealous\r\nhusband--he had the cheerful habit of strangling every pet his wife\r\ncared for and laying it without a word on her pillow--appear once a\r\nyear on the anniversary of the day on which the wife in desperation\r\nslew him. They preserve a most undoglike silence and follow the\r\nbeholder with strange gaze. Kipling's dog Harvey is a supernatural\r\nbeast, but what he represents I have never been able to determine. _At\r\nthe Gate_ is a recent story, showing a great concourse of dogs just\r\noutside the portals of heaven, unwilling to enter till their masters\r\ncome to join them.\r\n\r\n      [223] In _Another Little Heath Hound_.\r\n\r\nThe diabolic horse in Poe's _Metzengerstein_ is a curious composite of\r\nmetempsychosis, haunted inanimate object, and straight ghost, but at\r\nall events sufficiently terrifying to the victim it pursued. Algernon\r\nBlackwood in Wendigo has created a supernatural animal that flies\r\nthrough the air and carries men away to insanity and death. Henry\r\nRideout shows the ghost of a white tiger, while there are assorted\r\nelephant spooks, and Miss Burns in her studies in Shropshire folk-tales\r\nrelates stories of human beings whose ghosts appear as animals suited\r\nto the personality of the deceased, as bears, bulls, hogs, and so\r\nforth. That adds a new terror to death!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot only are new materials introduced in the later fiction of the\r\nuncanny but new types are stressed. In addition to the weird stories\r\ntold with direct aim and art--ghosts for ghosts' sake--there are tales\r\nwhere the supernatural element is of secondary importance, being\r\nused to teach some truth or ridicule some fallacy. The symbolistic,\r\nhumorous, and satiric methods abound in modern occult fiction and\r\nwhen well done have a double effect, that of primary supernatural\r\nimpressiveness, and, in addition, of the subtler purposes behind the\r\nstories. Moralized legends, spiritual allegories such as Hawthorne\r\nwrote with consummate art, have continued to the present and form\r\na contrast to the crude machinery of Gothic horrors. The delicacy\r\nof suggestion, the power of hinted ghostliness, though manifest in\r\nShakespeare, are really modern achievements, for no one save him\r\nattained to them in earlier art. Mystic poetic fiction, spiritual\r\nsymbolism appears in much of the modern unearthly writing. In certain\r\ncases it is interesting to note the change of old mythological stories\r\ninto moral allegory. The plays and the stories of Lord Dunsany are\r\npeculiarly symbolic and have the force of antique mythology made\r\ninstant and real. Yet they have a distinctive touch all their own.\r\nFor instance, the story of the king who goes over the world seeking\r\nhis lost yesterday, his dear past, who is told by the weird keeper\r\nof the bygone years that he cannot have it back, no not one golden\r\nsecond, has a delicate pathos of poetry. When the mournful king has\r\ngone back to his palace, a hoar harper comes who plays for him, and\r\nlo! to the strings of the harp have clung the golden seconds of his\r\nhappiest hours, so that he lives them over again while the music\r\nlasts. _The Book of the Serpent_ tells symbolic stories that are poems\r\nin prose, fantastic fables. The Creator is making experiments with\r\ndust-heaps, while the Serpent, the Turtle, and the Grasshopper look\r\non, ask questions, and offer comments. The Serpent trails all through\r\nthe dust-heap meant as stuff for artists, and the Maker drops a tear\r\nin that whereof He means to make mothers. He experiments with monkeys\r\ntrying to learn how best to make man, and after man is complete, He\r\nmakes woman. The stories of Oscar Wilde have, some of them, a beauty\r\nlike that of some antique illuminated missal, with its jeweled words,\r\nits mystic figures. Wilde's ornate style, prose that trembles on the\r\nverge of poetry, full of passion and color and light, makes one think\r\nof his own words in _The Nightingale and the Rose_, where the poet's\r\nsong was \"builded of music by moonlight and stained with his own\r\nheart's blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe delicate suggestion of the unearthly, the element of suspense that\r\ngives the sense of the supernatural to that which may be mortal, is\r\nseen in such stories as _A Dream of Provence_, by Frederick Wedmore.\r\nThe ancient belief that the soul may return to the body within a few\r\ndays after death forms the basis for this dream-poem in prose. It\r\nshows the soul on tiptoe for the Unseen, with a love transcending the\r\nbarriers of the grave, revealing idyllic sorrow in a father's love that\r\ndenies death, and expresses the sense of expectancy in the hope of a\r\nmiracle, with a beauty that is almost unbearable. Something of the same\r\ntheme, of a father's waiting by his daughter's grave to hear the loved\r\nvoice once more, is expressed in Andreyev's story.[224] But here there\r\nis horror and remorse instead of holy love. When the father cries out,\r\nthe silence that issues from the grave is more terrible than ghostly\r\nsounds would be, more dreadful in its supermortal suggestion.\r\n\r\n      [224] _Silence._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe purely humorous supernaturalism is essentially a new thing. The old\r\nreligious dramas had used comic devils, and Peele's Ghost of Jack is\r\nsupposed to be humorous, but not at all in the modern sense. There was\r\nnothing in early drama or fiction like the rollicking fun of Richard\r\nMiddleton's Ghost Ship, or Frank R. Stockton's spectral humorists. The\r\nwork of John Kendrick Bangs illustrates the free and easy manner of the\r\nmoderns toward ghosts, picturing them in unconventional situations and\r\ndivesting them of all their ancient dignity. He shows us the wraith\r\nof the maiden who drowned herself in a fit of pique, for which she\r\nis punished by having to haunt the ancestral house as a shower-bath.\r\nHis spectral cook of Bangletop is an original revenge-ghost, with a\r\nvillainous inversion of h's, who haunts an estate because a medieval\r\nbaron discharged her without wages. His convivial spooks in their ghost\r\nclub, his astrals who play pranks on mortals, and their confrères are\r\nexamples of the modern flippancy toward supernaturals.\r\n\r\nThe satirical use of supernaturalism is also new. Late literature\r\nlaughs at everything, with a daring familiarity undreamed of before,\r\nsave in sporadic cases. The devil has been an ancient subject for\r\nlaughter, but recent fiction ridicules him still more, so that we have\r\nscant respect for him, while the ghost, formerly a personage held in\r\ngreat respect, now comes in for his share of ragging. No being is\r\ntoo sacred to escape the light arrows of fun. Heaven is satirically\r\nexploited, and angels, saints, and even Deity have become subjects\r\nfor jesting, conventionalized with the mother-in-law, the tenderfoot,\r\nthe Irishman, and so forth. There is a considerable body of anecdotal\r\nliterature of the supernatural, showing to what extent the levity of\r\ntreatment has gone. Various aspects of mortal life are satirized, as\r\nin Inez Haynes Gilmore's _Angel Island_, which is a campaign document\r\nfor woman's suffrage. Satiric supernaturalism is employed to drive home\r\nmany truths, to puncture conceits of all kinds, and when well done is\r\neffective, for laughter is a clever weapon.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the later supernatural fiction over the earlier is\r\nnowhere seen more distinctly than in the increased effectiveness with\r\nwhich it manages the mechanics of emotion, its skill in selecting and\r\nelaborating the details by which terror and awe are produced. The\r\npresent-day artist of the uncanny knows how to strike the varied tones\r\nof supernaturalism, the shrill notes of fear, the deep diapason of awe,\r\nthe crashing chords of horror. The skillful writer chooses with utmost\r\ncare the seemingly trivial details that go to make up the atmosphere of\r\nthe unearthly. Shakespeare was a master of that, but none other of his\r\ntime. The knocking at the gate in _Macbeth_, for instance, is a perfect\r\nexample of the employment of a natural incident to produce an effect\r\nof the supernatural, as De Quincey has pointed out in his essay on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic novel relied largely for its impressiveness on emphasizing\r\nghostly scenes by representing aspects of weather to harmonize with\r\nthe emotions of the characters. This was overworked in terror fiction,\r\nand while it still possesses power it is a much less common method of\r\ntechnique than it used to be. Poe's introductory paragraph in _The\r\nFall of the House of Usher_ is a notable example of skill in creating\r\natmosphere of the supernatural by various details including phenomena\r\nof weather, and Hardy shows special power in harmonizing nature to the\r\nmoods and purposes of his characters. Yet many a modern story produces\r\na profound sense of awe, and purges the soul by means of terror with no\r\nreference at all to foreboding weather. However, the allusions now made\r\nare more skillful and show more selective power than of old.\r\n\r\nGothic fiction had much to say of melancholy birds that circled\r\nportentously over ancient castles filled with gloom and ghosts, but\r\nthey were generic and not individual specimens. The fowl was always\r\nspoken of as \"a bird of prey,\" \"a night bird,\" \"a bat,\" \"an owl,\" or\r\nby some such vague term. Natural history has become more generally\r\nknown since those times and writers of to-day introduce their ominous\r\nbirds with more definiteness and appropriateness. The repulsive bat\r\nthat clings to the window ledge in Bram Stoker's novel is a vampire,\r\na symbol of the whole horrible situation, as the kite that soars\r\nmenacingly overhead in another of his novels is individualized and\r\nbecomes a definite thing of terror. Poe's raven is vastly more a bird\r\nof evil than any specimen in the Gothic aviary. Robert W. Chambers\r\nbrings in a cormorant several times as a portent of ghostly disaster,\r\nparticularly foreboding when it turns toward the land. \"On the dark\r\nglistening cliffs, silhouetted against the glare of the sea, sat a\r\ncormorant, black, motionless, its horrible head raised toward heaven.\"\r\nThere is in recent fiction no bird more dreadful in import than the\r\nbelled buzzard that Irvin Cobb makes the leading figure in his story by\r\nthat name. This is an excellent example of the use of the natural to\r\nproduce terror and awe, for the murderer sees in the bird a minister of\r\nfate, and the faint tinkle of its bell as it soars over the marsh where\r\nthe body lies buried paralyzes him with horror. At last he can bear no\r\nmore, and hearing it, as he thinks, close at hand, he shrieks out his\r\nconfession,--only to find this time that it is not the belled buzzard\r\nat all that he hears, but only an old cowbell that a little negro child\r\nhas picked up in the barnyard!\r\n\r\nRobert W. Chambers in his early stories contrives to give varying\r\nsupernatural effects by descriptions of shadows as symbolic of life\r\nand character. He speaks of shadows of spirits or of persons fated to\r\ndisaster as white; again his supernatural shadows may be gray--gray\r\nis a favored shade for ghostly effect whether for witches or for\r\nphantoms--and sometimes they are perfectly black, to indicate differing\r\nconditions of destiny. Quiller-Couch has a strange little allegory,\r\n_The Magic Shadow_, and other writers have used similar methods to\r\nproduce uncanny effects.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic romance made much use of portents of the supernatural, which\r\nlater fiction does as well, but differently and with greater skill. The\r\nmodern stories for the most part abandon the conventional portents,\r\nthe dear old clock forever striking twelve or one--there was no\r\nGothic castle so impoverished as to lack such ghostly horologue!--the\r\nabbey bell that tolls at touch of spirit hands or wizard winds, the\r\nstatuesque nose-bleed, the fire that burns blue at approach of a\r\nspecter, and so forth. The later story is more selective in its aids\r\nto ghostly effect, and adapts the means desired to each particular\r\ncase, so that it hits the mark. For instance, the sardonic laughter\r\nthat sounds as the burglars are cracking the gate of heaven to get in,\r\nand imagining what they will find, is prophetic of the emptiness, the\r\nnothingness, that meets their astounded gaze when they are within.\r\nAmbrose Bierce in some of his stories describes the repulsiveness of\r\nthe fleshly corpse, reanimated by the spirit, perhaps not the spirit\r\nbelonging to it, with a loathly effect more awful than any purely\r\npsychic phantom could produce, which reminds us somewhat of the corpse\r\ncome to life in Thomas Lovell Beddoes's _Death's Jest Book_.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of invisibility in modern fiction avail to give a ghastly\r\nchill to the soul that visible apparitions rarely impart. Likewise the\r\neffect of mystery, of the incalculable element, in giving an impression\r\nof supernaturalism is a recognized method of technique in many stories,\r\nas the minister's black veil in Hawthorne's symbolic story. The\r\nunspeakable revolting suggestion in Edith Wharton's _The Eyes_, where\r\na man is haunted by two hideous eyes that \"have the physical effect\r\nof a bad smell, whose look left a smear like a snail,\" is built up\r\nwith uncommon art. We do not realize how much is due to insanity and\r\nhow much to the supernatural, when, after telling the story of his\r\nobsession, his fears that as a climax he will become like those Eyes,\r\nthe man suddenly sees his reflection in the mirror and meets their\r\ndreadful gaze. \"He and the image confronted each other with a glare\r\nof slowly gathering hate!\" Mention might be made of an incident in a\r\nrecently published literary drama, where a man seeks over the world for\r\nthe unknown woman with whom he has fallen in love, and on his calling\r\naloud in question as to who she is, \"the grave, with nettle-bearded\r\nlips replied, 'It is I, Death!'\" These are only suggestions of\r\nnumberless instances that might be given of a modern technique of\r\nsupernaturalism that surpasses anything in Gothic fiction.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of modern ghostly stories is aided by the\r\nsuggestiveness of the unearthly given by the use of \"sensitives,\"\r\nanimals or persons that are peculiarly alert to the occult impressions.\r\nWe see in many stories that children perceive the supernatural\r\npresences more quickly than adults, as in Mrs. Oliphant's story of the\r\nghost returning to right a wrong, trying strenuously to make herself\r\nknown to the grown person and realized only by a little child. In\r\nBelasco's play the little boy is the first and for a long time the only\r\none to sense the return of Peter Grimm. In Maeterlinck's _The Blind_,\r\nthe baby in arms is aware of the unearthly presences better than the\r\nmen and women. Sometimes the sensitive is a blind person, as the old\r\ngrandfather in another of Maeterlinck's short plays, who is conscious\r\nof the approaching Death before any of the others, or blind Anna in\r\nD'Annunzio's drama, _The Dead City_.\r\n\r\nAnimals are quick to perceive supernatural manifestations. Cats\r\nin fiction are shown as being at ease in the presence of ghosts\r\nperhaps because of their uncanny alliance with witches, while dogs\r\nand horses go wild with fear. This is noticed in many stories, as in\r\nBulwer-Lytton's story of the haunted house where the dog dies of\r\nterror in the face of the ghostly phenomena. The Psychic Doctor told of\r\nin Blackwood's uncanny stories, who goes to a house possessed by evil\r\nspirits, takes with him a cat and a dog which by their difference of\r\naction reveal to him the presence of the spirits long before they are\r\nvisualized for him.\r\n\r\nIn general, there is more power of suggestion in the later ghostly\r\nstories than in the earlier. The art is more subtle, the technique more\r\nskillfully studied, more artfully accidental.\r\n\r\nThere is in modern fiction, notably the work of Poe, and that of many\r\nrecent writers, Russian, French, and German as well as English, a type\r\nof supernaturalism that is closely associated with insanity. One may\r\nnot tell just where the line is drawn, just how much of the element\r\nof the uncanny is the result of the broodings of an unbalanced brain,\r\nand how much is real ghostliness. Poe's studies of madness verge on\r\nthe unearthly, as do Maupassant's, Hoffmann's, and others. Josephine\r\nDaskam Bacon illustrates this genre in a recent volume of stories, _The\r\nStrange Cases of Dr. Stanchion_, the plots centering round instances of\r\nparanoia occurring in the practice of a famous alienist,--yet they are\r\n_not paranoia alone_! One instance is of a young girl who is haunted\r\nby the ghost of a nurse who has died because given the wrong medicine\r\nby mistake. She is on the border-line of insanity when her lover cries\r\naloud that he would take the curse on himself for her if he could,\r\nwhich, by some unknown psychic law, does effect a transference which\r\nfrees her and obsesses him. Another is that of a man in the insane\r\nasylum, who recognizes in a mysterious housekeeper the spirit of his\r\nwife, who comes from the grave to keep him company and vanishes on the\r\nday of his death. These are curious analyses of the _idée fixe_ in\r\nits effect on the human mind, of insanity as a cause or effect of the\r\nsupernatural. Barry Pain's _Celestial Grocery_ is a recent example,\r\na story of a man whose madness carries him to another planet, showing\r\nhim inverted aspects of life, where emotions are the only real things,\r\nall else but shadows. Du Maurier's pathetic novel portraying the\r\npassion and anguish and joy of Peter Ibbetson that touches the thin\r\nline between sanity and madness, showing in his dream-metempsychosis\r\na power to relive the past and even to live someone else's life, is a\r\nstriking example. One interesting aspect of that story is the point\r\nwhere the spirit of Mary changes from the dream-lover of twenty-eight\r\nto the ghost of the woman of fifty-two, since she has died and can no\r\nmore come to her lover as she once did, but must come as her own\r\nphantom. There are extraordinary effects of insanity associated with\r\nthe supernatural in the work of Ambrose Bierce, of Arthur Machen and\r\nothers of the modern school. Italian literature shows some significant\r\ninstances in Fogazzaro's _The Woman_ and D'Annunzio's _Sogno d'un\r\nMattino di Primavera_. As Lord Dunsany says of it, \"Who can say of\r\ninsanity,--whether it be divine or of the Pit?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have noticed in preceding chapters two aspects of modern\r\nsupernaturalism as distinguished from the Gothic,--the giving of\r\ncumulative and more terrible power to ghostly beings, and on the\r\nother hand the leveling influence that makes them more human. The\r\naccess of horror and unearthly force as shown in the characters\r\ndescribed by certain writers is significant. In the work of Bierce,\r\nMachen, Blackwood, Stoker, and others supernaturalism is raised to\r\nthe nth power and every possible thrill is employed. The carrion\r\nghosts of Bierce, animated by malignant foreign spirits, surpass the\r\ncharnel shudders produced by the Gothic. Algernon Blackwood's Psychic\r\nInvasions, where localities rather than mere apartments or houses alone\r\nare haunted, diabolized by undying evil influences with compound\r\npower, his Elementals that control the forces of wind and wave and fire\r\nto work their demon will, are unlike anything that the early terror\r\nnovel conceived of. Horace Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe knew no thrills\r\nlike those of Bram Stoker's Count Dracula who is an immemorial evil,\r\na vampire and werewolf as well as man, with power to change himself\r\ninto a vampire bat or animal of prey at will. _The Unburied_, by\r\nJosephine Daskam Bacon, is more horrific than any mere revenge ghost,\r\nhowever much it shrieked \"Vindicta!\" The diabolism in Arthur Machen's\r\nwork reeks obscurely of a Pit more horrible than epic or drama has\r\nportrayed. In general, many of the later ghostly characters are more\r\ncomplex, more intense in evil than the Gothic.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that certain writers show a tendency to create\r\nsupernatural characters having an excess of evil power beyond the\r\nprevious uncanny beings, on the other hand there is an equally strong\r\nand significant tendency to reduce the ghostly beings nearer to the\r\nhuman. Fiction here, as frequently, seems ahead of general belief, and\r\nrefuses to believe in the altogether evil. Ghosts, angels, witches,\r\ndevils, werewolves, and so forth are now made more human, more like to\r\nman, yet without losing any of their ancient power to thrill. Ghosts\r\nin late literature have more of the mortal characteristics than ever\r\nbefore, as has been pointed out in a previous chapter. They look more\r\nhuman, more normal, they are clad in everyday garments of varied\r\ncolors, from red shirts and khaki riding-habits to ball-gowns,--though\r\ngray seems the favored shade for shades as well as witches,--and they\r\nhave lost that look of pallor that distinguished early phantoms. Now\r\nthey are more than merely vaporous projections as they used to be, more\r\nthan merely phantasmogenetic apparitions,--but are healthy, red-blooded\r\nspooks. They are not tongue-tied as their ancestors were, but are very\r\nchatty, giving forth views on everything they are interested in, from\r\nsocialism to the present war. And their range of interests has widened\r\nimmeasurably. It would seem that the literacy test has been applied to\r\nghosts in recent fiction. Modern specters are so normal in appearance\r\nthat often no one recognizes them as ghosts,--as in Edith Wharton's\r\nstory _Afterwards_, where the peculiar thing about the apparition\r\nhaunting a certain house is that it is not till long afterwards that\r\none knows it was a ghost. The man in the gray suit whom the wife thinks\r\na chance caller is the spirit of a man not yet dead, a terrible living\r\nrevenge-ghost, who finally takes his victim mysteriously away with him.\r\nModern ghosts have both motions and emotions like men, hence mortals\r\nare coming to regard them more sympathetically, to have more of a\r\nfellow-feeling for them.\r\n\r\nLikewise the angels are now only a very little higher if any than men.\r\nSeraphs are democratic, and angels have developed a sense of humor\r\nthat renders them more interesting than they used to be. The winged\r\nbeing that H. G. Wells's vicar goes gunning for is a charming youth\r\nwith a naïve satire, as the angels in Mark Twain's story of heaven\r\nare realistically mortal and masculine in tastes. They care little\r\nfor harps and crowns, grow fidgety under excess of rest, and engage\r\nin all sorts of activities, retaining their individual tastes. James\r\nStephens's archangel, seraph, and cherub are chatty, cordial souls with\r\nan avidity for cold potatoes and Irish companionship.\r\n\r\nThe demons as well have felt the same leveling influence experienced by\r\nthe ghosts and the angels. Only, in their case, the thing is reversed,\r\nand they are raised to the grade of humanity. We are coming to see,\r\nin modern fiction, at least, that the devil is not really black,\r\nonly a pleasant mottled gray like ourselves. Satan, in Mark Twain's\r\nposthumous novel,[225] is an affable young fellow, claiming to be the\r\nnephew and namesake of the personage best known by that name. Bernard\r\nShaw's devil is of a Chesterfieldian courtesy, willing to speed the\r\nparting as to welcome the coming guest. I have found no comic use of\r\nthe werewolf or of the vampire, though there are several comic witch\r\nstories, yet all these personages are humanized in modern fiction.\r\nWe feel in some recent supernatural stories a sense of a continuing\r\ncurrent of life. These ghosts, devils, witches, angels, and so forth\r\nare too real to be cut short by an author's _Finis_.\r\n\r\n      [225] _The Mysterious Stranger._\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the leveling influence is seen in the more than\r\nnatural power of motion, feeling, and intelligence given to inanimate\r\nobjects, machinery, plants, and animals, in late literature. The idea\r\nof endowing inanimate figures with life and personality is seen several\r\ntimes in Hawthorne's stories, as his snow image, Drowne's wooden image,\r\nthe vivified scarecrow, Feathertop, that the witch makes. The clay\r\nfigures that Satan in Mark Twain's novel models, endues with life, then\r\ndestroys with the fine, casual carelessness of a god, remind one of an\r\nincident from mythology. The statue in Edith Wharton's _The Duchess at\r\nPrayer_ that changes its expression, showing on its marble face through\r\na century the loathing and horror that the living countenance wore, or\r\nLord Dunsany's jade idol[226] that comes with stony steps across the\r\ndesolate moor to exact vengeance on four men helpless in its presence,\r\nhas a more intense thrill than Otranto's peripatetic statue. Lord\r\nDunsany's _The Gods of the Mountains_, of which Frank Harris says, \"It\r\nis the only play which has meant anything to me in twenty years,\" shows\r\nan inexorable fatality as in the Greek drama.\r\n\r\n      [226] In _A Night at an Inn_.\r\n\r\nScience is revealing wonderful facts and fiction is quick to realize\r\nthe possibilities for startling situations in every field. So diabolic\r\nbotanical specimens, animals endowed with human or more than human\r\ncraft--sometimes gifted with immortality as well--add a new interest\r\nto uncanny fiction. And the new machines that make all impossibilities\r\ncome to pass inspire a significant class of supernatural stories. In\r\ngeneral, a new force is given to all things, to raise them to the level\r\nof the human.\r\n\r\nIn the same way nature is given a new power and becomes man's\r\nequal,--sometimes far his superior--in thought and action. The\r\nmaelstrom in Poe's story is more than merely a part of the setting,--it\r\nis a terrible force in action. Algernon Blackwood stresses this\r\nvariously in his stories, as where Egypt is shown as a vital presence\r\nand power, or where the \"goblin trees\" are as awful as any of the\r\nother characters of evil, or in the wind and flame on the mountain\r\nthat are elements of supernatural power, with a resistless lure for\r\nmortals, or in the vampire soil that steals a man's strength. This may\r\nbe illustrated as well from the drama, as in Maeterlinck's where Death\r\nis the silent, invisible, yet dominant force, or in Synge's where the\r\nsea is a terrible foe, lying in wait for man, or in August Stramm's\r\n_The Daughter of the Moor_, where the moor is a compelling character\r\nof evil. Gothic fiction did associate the phenomena of nature with\r\nthe moods of the action, yet in a less effective way. The aspects of\r\nnature in recent literature have been raised to the level of humanity,\r\nbecoming mortal or else diabolic or divine.\r\n\r\nIn general, in modern fiction, man now makes his supernatural\r\ncharacters in his own image. Ghosts, angels, devils, witches,\r\nwerewolves, are humanized, made like to man in appearance, passions,\r\nand powers. On the other hand, plants, inanimate objects, and animals,\r\nas well as the phenomena of nature, are raised to the human plane\r\nand given access of power. This leveling process democratizes the\r\nsupernatural elements and tends to make them almost equal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe present revival of interest in the supernatural and its appearance\r\nin literature are as marked in the drama as in fiction or poetry. Mr.\r\nE. C. Whitmore, in a recently published volume on _The Supernatural in\r\nTragedy_, has ably treated the subject, especially in the Greek classic\r\nperiod and the Elizabethan age in England. His thesis is that the\r\nsupernatural is most frequently associated with tragedy, and is found\r\nwhere tragedy is at its best. This may be true of earlier periods of\r\nthe tragic drama, yet it would be going too far to make the assertion\r\nof the drama of the present time. The occult makes its appearance to a\r\nconsiderable extent now in melodrama and even in comedy, though with no\r\ndecrease in the frequency and effectiveness of its use in tragedy. This\r\nonly illustrates the widening of its sphere and its adaptability to\r\nvarying forms of art.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of some of the plays produced in the last few years,\r\nmost of them being seen in New York, will illustrate the extent to\r\nwhich the ghostly motifs are used on the stage of to-day. Double\r\npersonality is represented[227] by Edward Locke, in a play which\r\nis said by critics to be virtually a dramatization of Dr. Morton\r\nPrince's study,[228] where psychological apparatus used in laboratory\r\nexperiments to expel the evil intruder from the girl, a chronoscope, a\r\ndynograph, revolving mirrors, make the setting seem truly psychical.\r\nBut the most dramatic instance of the kind, of course, is the\r\ndramatization of Dr. Jekyll's alter ego.\r\n\r\n      [227] In _The Case of Becky_.\r\n\r\n      [228] _The Disassociation of a Personality._\r\n\r\nThe plays of Charles Rann Kennedy[229] and Jerome K. Jerome[230] are\r\nakin to the old mystery plays in that they personate divinity and\r\nshow the miracle of Christly influence on sinful hearts. Augustus\r\nThomas[231] and Edward Milton Royle[232] introduce hypnotism as the\r\nbasis of complication and denouement. Supernatural healing, miraculous\r\nintervention of divine power, occur in plays by William Vaughan\r\nMoody,[233] Björnson,[234] and George M. Cohan.[235] Another[236]\r\nturns on converse with spirits, as does Belasco's _Return of Peter\r\nGrimm_, while a war play by Vida Sutton[237] shows four ghosts on the\r\nstage at once, astonishing phantoms who do not realize that they are\r\ndead. Others[238] have for their themes miracles of faith and rescue\r\nfrom danger, though the first-named play satirizes such belief and the\r\nlatter is a piece of Catholic propaganda.\r\n\r\n      [229] _The Servant in the House._\r\n\r\n      [230] _The Passing of the Third Floor Back._\r\n\r\n      [231] In _The Witching Hour_.\r\n\r\n      [232] In _The Unwritten Law_.\r\n\r\n      [233] _The Faith Healer._\r\n\r\n      [234] _Beyond Their Strength._\r\n\r\n      [235] _The Miracle Man._\r\n\r\n      [236] _The Spiritualist._\r\n\r\n      [237] _Kingdom Come._\r\n\r\n      [238] As _The Eternal Mystery_, by George Jean Nathan, and _The\r\n      Rosary_.\r\n\r\n_Magic_, by G. K. Chesterton, introduces supernatural forces whereby\r\nstrange things are made to happen, such as the changing of the electric\r\nlight from green to blue. _Peter Ibbetson_, the dramatization of Du\r\nMaurier's novel, shows dream-supernaturalism, and various other psychic\r\neffects in a delicate and distinctive manner. And _The Willow Tree_, by\r\nBenrimo and Harrison Rhodes, is built upon an ancient Japanese legend,\r\nrelating a hamadryad myth with other supermortal phantasies, such as\r\nrepresenting a woman's soul as contained in a mirror.\r\n\r\nWe have fairy plays by J. M. Barrie,[239] W. B. Yeats,[240] and\r\nMaeterlinck,[241] and the mermaid has even been staged,[242] Bernard\r\nShaw shows us the devil in his own home town, while Hauptmann gives us\r\nHannele's visions of heaven. The Frankenstein theme is used to provoke\r\nlaughter mixed with thrills.[243] Owen and Robert Davis[244] symbolize\r\nman's better angel, while _The Eternal Magdalene_, a dream-drama, shows\r\nanother piece of symbolic supernaturalism. Lord Dunsany's plays have\r\nalready been mentioned.\r\n\r\n      [239] _Peter Pan._\r\n\r\n      [240] _The Land of Heart's Desire._\r\n\r\n      [241] _The Blue Bird._\r\n\r\n      [242] _The Mermaid._\r\n\r\n      [243] In _The Last Laugh_, by Paul Dickey and Charles W.\r\n      Goddard.\r\n\r\n      [244] In _Any House_.\r\n\r\nYet the drama, though showing a definite revival of the supernatural,\r\nand illustrating various forms of it, is more restricted than fiction.\r\nMany aspects of the occult appear and the psychic drama is popular,\r\nbut the necessities of presentation on the stage inevitably bar many\r\nforms of the ghostly art that take their place naturally in fiction.\r\nThe closet drama does not come under this limitation, for in effect\r\nit is almost as free as fiction to introduce mystical, symbolic, and\r\ninvisible presences. The closet drama is usually in poetic form and\r\npoetry is closer akin to certain forms of the supernatural than is\r\nprose, which makes their use more natural.\r\n\r\nThe literary playlet, so popular just now, uses the ghostly in many\r\nways. One shows the Archangel Raphael with his dog, working miracles,\r\nwhile another includes in its _dramatis personæ_ a faun and a moon\r\ngoddess who insists on giving the faun a soul, at which he wildly\r\nprotests. As through suffering and human pain he accepts the gift, a\r\nsymbolic white butterfly poises itself on his uplifted hand, then flits\r\ntoward Heaven. In another, Padraic yields himself to the fairies' power\r\nas the price of bread for the girl he loves. Theodore Dreiser's short\r\nplays bring in creatures impossible of representation on the stage,\r\n\"persistences\" of fish, animals, and birds, symbolic Shadows, a Blue\r\nSphere, a Power of Physics, Nitrous Acid, a Fast Mail (though trains\r\nhave been used on the stage), and so forth.\r\n\r\nInstances from recent German drama might be given, as the work of\r\nAugust Stramm, who like Rupert Brooke and the ill-starred poets of\r\nthe Irish revolution has fallen as a sacrifice to the war. An article\r\nin the _Literary Digest_ says of Stramm that \"he felt behind all the\r\nbeauty of the world its elemental passions and believed these to be the\r\nprojections of human passions in the waves of wind and light and water,\r\nin flames of earth.\" He includes among his characters[245] a Spider,\r\nNightingales, Moonlight, Wind, and Blossoms. Carl Hauptmann[246]\r\nlikewise shows the elemental forces of nature and of super-nature. On\r\nthe battlefield of death the dead arise to join in one dreadful chant\r\nof hate against their enemies.\r\n\r\n      [245] In _Sancta Susanna_.\r\n\r\n      [246] In _The Dead Are Singing_.\r\n\r\nLeonid Andreyev's striking play[247] might be mentioned as an example\r\nfrom the Russian. King-Hunger, Death, and Old time Bell-Ringer, are\r\nthe principal actors, while the human beings are all deformed and\r\ndistorted, \"one continuous malicious monstrosity bearing only a remote\r\nlikeness to man.\" The starving men are slain, but over the field of\r\nthe dead the motionless figure of Death is seen silhouetted. But the\r\ndead arise, and a dull, distant, manifold murmur, as if underground, is\r\nheard, \"We come! Woe unto the victorious!\"\r\n\r\n      [247] _King-Hunger._\r\n\r\nBut as I have said, these are literary dramas, impossible of\r\npresentation on the stage, so that they are judged by literary rather\r\nthan dramatic standards. For the most part fiction is infinitely freer\r\nin its range and choice of subjects from the supernatural than is the\r\ndrama. The suggestive, symbolic, mystic effects which could not in\r\nany way be presented on the stage, but which are more truly of the\r\nprovince of poetry, are used in prose that has a jeweled beauty and a\r\nmelody as of poetry. Elements such as invisibility, for instance, and\r\nvarious occult agencies may be stressed and analyzed in fiction as\r\nwould be impossible on the stage. The close relation between insanity\r\nand the weird can be much more effectively shown in the novel or short\r\nstory than in the drama, as the forces of mystery, the incalculable\r\nagencies can be thus better emphasized. Ghosts need to be seen on the\r\nstage to have the best effect, even if they are meant as \"selective\r\napparitions\" like Banquo, and if thus seen they are too corporeal for\r\nthe most impressive influence, while in fiction they can be suggested\r\nwith delicate reserve. Supernatural presences that could not be imaged\r\non the boards may be represented in the novel or story, as Blackwood's\r\nElementals or Psychic Invasions. How could one stage such action,\r\nfor instance, as his citizens turning into witch-cats or his Giant\r\nDevil looming mightily in the heavens? Likewise in fiction the full\r\npresentation of scientific supernaturalism can be achieved, which would\r\nbe impossible on the stage.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it might be said that fiction offers the most\r\npopular present vehicle for expression of the undoubtedly reviving\r\nsupernaturalism in English literature. And fiction is likewise the best\r\nform, that which affords the more varied chances for effectiveness.\r\nThe rising tide of the unearthly in art shows itself in all literary\r\nforms, as dramatic, narrative, and lyric poetry, with a few epics--in\r\nthe playlet as in the standard drama, in the short story as in the\r\nnovel. It manifests itself in countless ways in current literature and\r\ninviting lines of investigation suggest themselves with reference to\r\nvarious aspects of its study. The supernatural as especially related to\r\nreligion offers an interesting field for research. The miracles from\r\nthe Bible are often used, as in Lew Wallace's _Ben Hur_, and Christ\r\nis introduced in other times and places, as the war novel,[248] or in\r\nMarie Corelli's satire on Episcopacy,[249] where the cardinal finds the\r\nChrist child outside the cathedral. The more than mortal elements, as\r\nanswers to prayer, the experience of conversion, spiritual miracles,\r\nand so forth, are present to a considerable extent in modern fiction.\r\nTwo very recent novels of importance base their plots on the miraculous\r\nin religion, _The Brook Kerith_, by George Moore, and _The Leather-wood\r\nGod_, by William Dean Howells. I have touched on this aspect of the\r\nsubject in a previous article.[250]\r\n\r\n      [248] _The Second Coming._\r\n\r\n      [249] _The Master Christian._\r\n\r\n      [250] \"Religion in Recent American Novels,\" in the January,\r\n      1914, _Review and Expositor_.\r\n\r\nOne might profitably trace out the appearances of the ghostly in\r\nmodern poetry, or one might study its manifestations in the late\r\ndrama, including melodrama and comedy as well as tragedy. This present\r\ntreatment of the supernatural in modern English fiction makes no\r\npretensions to being complete. It is meant to be suggestive rather than\r\nexhaustive, and I shall be gratified if it may help to arouse further\r\ninterest in a significant and vital phase of our literature and lead\r\nothers to pursue the investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  _Accusing Spirit, The_, 21\r\n  _Address to the De'il, An_, 131\r\n  Æsop, _Fables_, 231\r\n  _Affair of Dishonor, An_, 91\r\n  _Afterwards_, 102, 202\r\n  _Afterwards_, 302\r\n  Ahasuerus, 176\r\n  _Ahrinziman_, 88, 183, 213\r\n  Aids to Gothic Effect, 36 _et seq._\r\n  Ainsworth, W.

The index was not checked for\r\nerrors in alfabetisation or page numbers. The subtitle of Chapter III\r\nwas formatted different from the others in the original, this has not\r\nbeen changed. Some of the lemma's in the index appear to be identical,\r\nbut they are probably meant to refer to different books with the same\r\ntitle.",
