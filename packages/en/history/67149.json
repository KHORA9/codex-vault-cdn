It is for\r\n  your father, mother, or teacher, and is\r\n  what they would call the\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn common with all children of my age, I was brought up on American\r\nHistory and given no other history but American, year in and year out,\r\nyear after year for eight or more years.\r\n\r\nSo far as I knew 1492 was the beginning of the world. Any events or\r\ncharacters before that time, reference to which I encountered by any\r\nchance, were put down in my mind in the same category with fairy-tales.\r\nChrist and His times, of which I heard only in Sunday-school, were to\r\nme mere fiction without reality. They were not mentioned in any history\r\nthat I knew and therefore, so I thought, must belong _not_ to a realm\r\nin time and space, but to a spiritual realm.\r\n\r\nTo give an American child only American History is as provincial as\r\nto teach a Texas child only Texas History. Patriotism is usually\r\ngiven as the reason for such history teaching. It only promotes a\r\nnarrow-mindedness and an absurd conceit, based on utter ignorance of\r\nany other peoples and any other times--an intolerant egotism without\r\nfoundation in fact. Since the World War it has become increasingly more\r\nand more important that American children should have a knowledge of\r\nother countries and other peoples in order that their attitude may be\r\nintelligent and unprejudiced.\r\n\r\nAs young as nine years of age, a child is eagerly inquisitive as to\r\nwhat has taken place in the ages past and readily grasps a concept of\r\nWorld History. Therefore, for many years Calvert School nine-year-old\r\npupils have been taught World History in spite of academic and\r\nparental skepticism and antagonism. But I have watched the gradual\r\ndrift toward adoption of this plan of history teaching, and with it an\r\never-increasing demand for a text-book of general history for young\r\nchildren. I have found, however, that all existing text-books have to\r\nbe largely abridged and also supplemented by a running explanation and\r\ncomment, to make them intelligible to the young child.\r\n\r\nThe recent momentous studies into the native intelligence of children\r\nshow us what the average child at different ages can understand and\r\nwhat he cannot understand--what dates, figures of speech, vocabulary,\r\ngeneralities, and abstractions he can comprehend and what he cannot\r\ncomprehend--and in the future all text-books will have to be written\r\nwith constant regard for these intelligence norms. Otherwise, such\r\ntexts are very likely to be “over the child’s head.” They will be\r\ntrying to teach him some things at least that, in the nature of the\r\ncase, are beyond him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the writer has been in constant contact with\r\nthe child mind for a great many years, he has found that whatever\r\nwas written in his study had to be revised and rewritten each time\r\nafter the lesson had been tried out in the class-room. Even though\r\nthe first writing was in what he considered the simplest language,\r\nhe has found that each and every word and expression has had to be\r\nsubjected again and again to this class-room test to determine what\r\nmeaning is conveyed. The slightest inverted phraseology or possibility\r\nof double meaning has oftentimes been misconstrued or found confusing.\r\nFor instance, the statement that “Rome was _on_ the Tiber River” has\r\nquite commonly been taken to mean that the city was literally built\r\n_on top_ of the river, and the child has had some sort of fantastic\r\nvision of houses built on piles in the river. A child of nine is still\r\nvery young--he may still believe in Santa Claus--younger in ideas, in\r\nvocabulary and in understanding than most adults appreciate--even\r\nthough they be parents or teachers--and new information can hardly be\r\nput too simply.\r\n\r\nSo the topics selected have not always been the most important--but the\r\nmost important that can be understood and appreciated by a child. Most\r\npolitical, sociological, economic, or religious generalities are beyond\r\na child’s comprehension, no matter how simply told. After all, this\r\nHistory is only a preliminary story.\r\n\r\nExcellent biographies and stories from general history have been\r\nwritten. But biographies from history do not give an historic outline.\r\nThey do not give any outline at all for future filling in; and, indeed,\r\nunless they themselves are fitted into such a general historical\r\nscheme, they are nothing more than so many disconnected tales floating\r\nabout in the child’s mind with no associations of time or space.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the subject in this book is, therefore,\r\nchronological--telling the story of what has happened century by\r\ncentury and epoch by epoch, not by nations. The story of one nation is\r\ninterrupted to take up that of another as different plots in a novel\r\nare brought forward simultaneously. This is in line with the purpose,\r\nwhich is to give the pupil a continuous view or panorama of the ages,\r\nrather than Greek History from start to finish, then, retracing the\r\nsteps of time, Roman History, and so on. The object is to sketch the\r\nwhole picture in outline, leaving the details to be gradually filled\r\nin by later study, as the artist sketches the general scheme of his\r\npicture before filling in the details. Such a scheme is as necessary to\r\norderly classification of historical knowledge as is a filing system in\r\nany office that can function properly or even at all.\r\n\r\nThe Staircase of Time is to give a visual idea of the extent of time\r\nand the progressive steps in the History of the World. Each “flight”\r\nrepresents a thousand years, and each “step” a hundred--a century. If\r\nyou have a spare wall, either in the play-room, attic, or barn such\r\na Staircase of Time on a large scale may be drawn upon it from floor\r\nto reaching height and made a feature if elaborated with pictures or\r\ndrawings of people and events. If the wall faces the child’s bed so\r\nmuch the better, for when lying awake in the morning or at any other\r\ntime, instead of imagining fantastic designs on the wall-paper, he may\r\npicture the crowded events on the Staircase of Time. At any rate, the\r\nchild should constantly refer either to such a Staircase of Time or to\r\nthe Time Table as each event is studied, until he has a mental image of\r\nthe Ages past.\r\n\r\nAt first a child does not appreciate time values represented by numbers\r\nor the relative position of dates on a time line and will wildly say\r\ntwenty-five hundred B. C. or twenty-five thousand B. C. or twenty-five\r\nmillion B. C. indiscriminately. Only by constantly referring dates to\r\nposition on the Staircase of Time or the Time Table can a child come\r\nto visualize dates. You may be _amused_, but do not be _amazed_, if a\r\nchild gives 776 thousand years A.D. as the date for the First Olympiad,\r\nor says that Italy is located in Athens, or that Abraham was a hero of\r\nthe Trojan War.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever been introduced to a roomful of strangers at one\r\ntime, you know how futile it is to attempt even to remember their\r\nnames to say nothing of connecting names and faces. It is necessary\r\nto hear something interesting about each one before you can begin to\r\nrecall names and faces. Likewise an introduction to World History, the\r\ncharacters and places in which are utterly unknown strangers to the\r\nchild, must be something more than a mere name introduction, and there\r\nmust be very few introductions given at a time or both names and faces\r\nwill be instantly forgotten. It is also necessary to repeat new names\r\nconstantly in order that the pupil may gradually become familiarized\r\nwith them, for so many strange people and places are bewildering.\r\n\r\nIn order to serve the purpose of a basal outline, which in the future\r\nis to be filled in, it is necessary that the Time Table be made a\r\npermanent possession of the pupil. This Time Table, therefore, should\r\nbe studied like the multiplication tables until it is known one\r\nhundred per cent and for “keeps,” and until the topic connected with\r\neach date can be elaborated as much as desired. The aim should be to\r\nhave the pupil able to start with Primitive Man and give a summary of\r\nWorld History to the present time, with dates and chief events without\r\nprompting, questioning, hesitation, or mistake. Does this seem too much\r\nto expect? It is not as difficult as it may sound, if suggestions given\r\nin the text for connecting the various events into a sequence and for\r\npassing names and events in a condensed review are followed. Hundreds\r\nof Calvert children each year are successfully required to do this very\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThe attitude, however, usually assumed by teachers, that “even if the\r\npupil forgets it all, there will be left a valuable impression,” is too\r\noften an apology for superficial teaching and superficial learning.\r\nHistory may be made just as much a “mental discipline” as some other\r\nstudies, but only if difficulties of dates and other abstractions are\r\nsquarely met and overcome by hard study and learned to be remembered,\r\nnot merely to be forgotten after the recitation. The story part the\r\nchild will easily remember, but it is the “who and when and where and\r\nwhy” that are important, and this part is the serious study. Instead\r\nof, “A man, once upon a time,” he should say, “King John in 1215 at\r\nRunnymede because--”\r\n\r\nThis book, therefore, is not a supplementary reader but a basal history\r\nstudy. Just enough narrative is told to give the skeleton flesh and\r\nblood and make it living. The idea is not how much but how little can\r\nbe told; to cut down one thousand pages to less than half of that\r\nnumber without leaving only dry bones.\r\n\r\nNo matter how the subject is presented it is necessary that the child\r\ndo his part and put his own brain to work; and for this purpose he\r\n_should be required to retell each story after he has read it_ and\r\nshould be repeatedly questioned on names and dates as well as stories,\r\nto make sure he is retaining and assimilating what he hears.\r\n\r\nI recall how once upon a time a young chap, just out of college, taught\r\nhis first class in history. With all the enthusiasm of a full-back who\r\nhas just kicked a goal from field, he talked, he sang; he drew maps\r\non the blackboard, on the floor, on the field; he drew pictures, he\r\nvaulted desks, and even stood on his head to illustrate points. His\r\npupils attended spellbound, with their eyes wide open, their ears wide\r\nopen, and their mouths wide open. They missed nothing. They drank in\r\nhis flow of words with thirst unquenched; but, like Baron Munchausen,\r\nhe had failed to look at the other end of the drinking horse that had\r\nbeen cut in half. At the end of a month his kindly principal suggested\r\na test, and he gave it with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\nThere were only three questions:\r\n\r\n  (1) Tell all you can about Columbus.\r\n  (2)   “   “   “   “    “   Jamestown.\r\n  (3)   “   “   “   “    “   Plymouth.\r\n\r\nAnd here are the three answers of one of the most interested pupils:\r\n\r\n  (1) He was a _grate_ man.\r\n  (2)  “  “  “   “      “\r\n  (3)  “  “  “   “      “ _to_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the\r\n\r\nSTAIRCASE OF TIME\r\n\r\nIt starts far, far, below the bottom of the pages and rises up, UP, UP\r\nto where we are NOW--each step a hundred years, each flight of steps a\r\nthousand. It will keep on up until it reaches high heaven. From where\r\nwe are NOW let us look down the flights below us and listen to the\r\nStory of what has happened in the long years gone by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTIME TABLE\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\nDATES AND OTHER FOOD FOR THOUGHT\r\n\r\n_Don’t devour these dates all at once, or they’ll make you sick, and\r\nyou’ll never want to see one again._\r\n\r\n_Take them piecemeal, only one or two at a time after each story, and\r\nbe sure to digest them thoroughly._\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  Beginning of the Earth                                               3\r\n  First Rain-storm                                                     7\r\n  Plants                                                               7\r\n  Mites                                                                8\r\n  Insects                                                              8\r\n  Fish                                                                 8\r\n  Frogs                                                                8\r\n  Snakes                                                               8\r\n  Birds                                                                8\r\n  Animals                                                              8\r\n  Monkeys                                                              8\r\n  People                                                               8\r\n  4000 B.C.

Of\r\ncourse there were no houses, for there was no one to build them or to\r\nlive in them, no towns or cities--nothing that people make. There were\r\njust wild animals--bears and wolves, birds and butterflies, frogs and\r\nsnakes, turtles and fish. Can you think of such a world as that?\r\n\r\n  Then,\r\n        long, long, long\r\n\r\nbefore that, there was a time when there were _NO PEOPLE_ and _NO\r\nANIMALS_ of any sort in the whole world; there were just growing\r\nplants, trees and bushes, grass and flowers. Can you think of such a\r\nworld as that?\r\n\r\n  Then,\r\n        long, long, long,\r\n        long, long, long\r\n\r\nbefore that, there was a time when there were _NO PEOPLE, NO ANIMALS,\r\nNO PLANTS_, in the whole world; there was just bare rock and water\r\neverywhere. Can you think of such a world as that?\r\n\r\n  Then,\r\n        long, long, long\r\n        long, long, long--you might\r\n                    keep on saying--\r\n       “long, long, long,” all day, and\r\n                    to-morrow, and all\r\n                    next week, and next\r\n                    month, and next\r\n                    year, and it would\r\n                    not be long enough--\r\n\r\nbefore this, there was a time when there was\r\n_NO WORLD AT ALL!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were only the Stars\r\n\r\nNothing else!\r\n\r\nNow, real Stars are not things with points like those in the corner of\r\na flag or the gold ones you put on a Christmas tree. The real stars in\r\nthe sky have no points. They are huge burning coals of fire--coals of\r\nfire. Each star, however, is so huge that there is nothing in the world\r\nnow anywhere nearly as big. One little bit, one little scrap of a star\r\nis bigger than our whole world--than our whole world.\r\n\r\nOne of these stars is our Sun--yes, our Sun. The other stars would\r\nlook the same as the Sun if we could get as close to them. But at that\r\ntime, so long, long ago, our Sun was not just a big, round, white,\r\nhot ball as we see it in the sky to-day. It was then more like the\r\nfireworks you may have seen on the Fourth of July. It was whirling and\r\nsputtering and throwing off sparks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sun sputtering and throwing off sparks.]\r\n\r\nOne of these sparks which the Sun threw far off got cool just as a\r\nspark from the crackling log in the fireplace gets cool, and this\r\ncooled-off spark was--\r\n\r\n  What do you suppose?\r\n  See if you can guess--\r\n  It was our World!--yes, the World\r\n  on which we now live.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, our World or Earth was nothing but a ball of rock.\r\nThis ball of rock was wrapped around with steam, like a heavy fog.\r\n\r\nThen the steam turned to rain and it rained on the World,\r\n\r\n  a  a  a\r\n  n  n  n\r\n  d  d  d\r\n\r\n  i  i  i\r\n  t  t  t\r\n\r\n  r  r  r\r\n  a  a  a\r\n  i  i  i\r\n  n  n  n\r\n  e  e  e\r\n  d  d  d\r\n\r\nuntil it had filled up the hollows and made enormously big puddles.\r\nThese puddles were the oceans. The dry places were bare _rock_.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came the first living things--_tiny plants_ that you\r\ncould only have seen under a microscope. At first they grew only in\r\nthe water, then along the water’s edge, then out on the rock.\r\n\r\nThen dirt or soil, as people call it, formed all over the rock and made\r\nthe rock into land, and the plants grew larger and spread farther over\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came the first _tiny animals_ in the water. They were\r\nwee _Mites_ like drops of jelly.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came things like _Insects_, some that live _in_ the\r\nwater, some _on_ the water, some _on_ the land, and some _in_ the air.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came _Fish_, that live only in the water.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came _Frogs_, that live in the water and on the land,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came _Snakes_ and huge _lizards_ bigger than\r\nalligators, more like dragons; and they grew so big that at last they\r\ncould not move and died because they could not get enough food to eat.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came _Birds_ that lay eggs and those _Animals_ like\r\nfoxes and elephants and cows that nurse their babies when they are born.\r\n\r\nThen, after this, came _Monkeys_.\r\n\r\nThen, last of all, came--what do you suppose? Yes--_People_--men,\r\nwomen, and children.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps; see if you can take them:\r\n\r\n  STAR, SUN;\r\n      SUN, SPARK;\r\n          SPARK, WORLD;\r\n              WORLD, STEAM;\r\n                  STEAM, RAIN;\r\n                      RAIN, OCEANS.\r\n\r\n  OCEANS, PLANTS;\r\n      PLANTS, MITES;\r\n          MITES, INSECTS;\r\n              INSECTS, FISH;\r\n                  FISH, FROGS;\r\n                      FROGS, SNAKES.\r\n\r\n  SNAKES, BIRDS;\r\n      BIRDS, ANIMALS;\r\n          ANIMALS, MONKEYS;\r\n              MONKEYS, PEOPLE;\r\n                  And here we are!\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose will be next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nUmfa-Umfa and Itchy-Scratchy\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you suppose I know about all these things that took place so\r\nlong ago?\r\n\r\nI don’t.\r\n\r\nI’m only guessing about them.\r\n\r\nBut there are different kinds of guesses. If I hold out my two closed\r\nhands and ask you to guess which one has the penny in it, that is one\r\nkind of a guess. Your guess might be right or it might be wrong. It\r\nwould be just luck.\r\n\r\nBut there is another kind of a guess. When there is snow on the ground\r\nand I see tracks of a boot in the snow, I guess that a man must have\r\npassed by, for boots don’t usually walk without some one in them. That\r\nkind of a guess is not just luck but common sense.\r\n\r\nAnd so we can guess about a great many things that have taken place\r\nlong ago, even though there was no one there at the time to see them or\r\ntell about them.\r\n\r\nMen have dug down deep under the ground in different parts of the world\r\nand have found there--what do you suppose?\r\n\r\nI don’t believe you would ever guess.\r\n\r\nThey have found the heads of arrows and spears and hatchets.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar thing about these arrows and spears and hatchets is that\r\nthey are not made of iron or steel, as you might expect, but of stone.\r\n\r\nNow, we are sure that only men could have made and used such things,\r\nfor birds and fish or other animals do not use hatchets or spears.\r\nWe are also sure that these men must have lived long, long years ago\r\nbefore iron and steel were known, because it must have taken long, long\r\nyears for these things to have become covered up so deep by dust and\r\ndirt. We have also found the bones of the people themselves, who must\r\nhave died thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before any one\r\nbegan to write down history. So we know that the people who were living\r\non the earth then were working and playing, eating and fighting--doing\r\nmany of the same things we are to-day--especially the fighting.\r\n\r\nThis time in the pre-history of the world, when people used such things\r\nmade of stone, is therefore called THE STONE AGE.\r\n\r\nThese First Stone Age People we call _Primitive_, which simply means\r\nFirst as a Primer means First Reader. Primitive People were wild\r\nanimals. Unlike other wild animals, however, they walked on their hind\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThese First People had hair growing, not just on their heads, but all\r\nover their bodies, like some shaggy dogs. They had no houses of any\r\nsort in which to live. They simply lay down on the ground when night\r\ncame. Later, when the earth became cold, they found caves in the rocks\r\nor in the hillsides where they could get away from the cold and storms\r\nand other wild animals. So men, women, and children of this time were\r\ncalled _Cave People_.\r\n\r\nThey spent their days hunting some animals and running and hiding from\r\nothers. They caught animals by trapping them in a pit covered over with\r\nbushes, or they killed them with a club or a rock if they had a chance,\r\nor with stone-headed arrows or hatchets. They even drew pictures of\r\nthese animals on the walls of their caves, scratching the picture with\r\na pointed stone, and some of these pictures we can still see to-day.\r\n\r\nThey lived on berries and nuts and grass-seeds. They robbed the nests\r\nof birds for the eggs, which they ate raw, for they had no fire to cook\r\nwith. They were blood-thirsty; they liked to drink the warm blood of\r\nanimals they killed, as you would a glass of milk.\r\n\r\nThey talked to each other by some sort of grunts--\r\n\r\n“Umfa, umfa, glug, glug.”\r\n\r\nThey made clothes of skins of animals they killed, for there was no\r\nsuch thing as cloth. And yet, although they were real men, they lived\r\nso much like wild animals that we call such people _savages_.\r\n\r\nPrimitive Men were not pleasant people. They were fearful and cruel\r\ncreatures, who beat and killed and robbed whenever they had a chance.\r\n\r\nA cave man got his wife by stealing a girl away from her own cave home,\r\nknocking her senseless, and dragging her off by her hair, if necessary.\r\nThe men were fighters but not brave. They would kill other animals and\r\nother men if the others were weaker or if they could sneak upon them\r\nand catch them off their guard, but if others were stronger they would\r\nrun and hide.\r\n\r\nTheir only rule of life was hurt and kill what you can, and run from\r\nwhat you can’t. This is what we call the first law of nature--every man\r\nfor himself. They knew if they didn’t kill they would be killed, for\r\nthere were no laws nor police to protect them.\r\n\r\nThese primitive cave people are our ancestors, and we get from them\r\nmany of their wild ways. In spite of our religion and manners and\r\neducation, there are many men still living who act in the same way when\r\nthey get a chance.\r\n\r\nJails are made for such men.\r\n\r\nSuppose you had been a boy or a girl in the Stone Age, with a name\r\nlike Itchy-Scratchy. I wonder how you would have liked the life.\r\n\r\nWhen you woke up in the morning, you would not have bathed or even\r\nwashed your hands and face or brushed your teeth or combed your hair.\r\n\r\nYou ate with your fingers, for there were no knives or forks or spoons\r\nor cups or saucers, only one bowl--which your mother had made out of\r\nmud and dried in the sun to hold water to drink--no dishes to wash and\r\nput away, no chairs, no tables, no table manners.\r\n\r\nThere were no books, no paper, no pencils.\r\n\r\nThere was no Saturday or Sunday, January or July. Except that one day\r\nwas warm and sunny or another cold and rainy, they were all alike.\r\nThere was no school to go to. Every day was a holiday.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do all day long but make mud pies or pick berries\r\nor play tag with your brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nI wonder how you would like that kind of life!\r\n\r\n“Fine!” do you think?--“a great life--just like camping out?”\r\n\r\nBut I have only told you part of the story.\r\n\r\nThe cave would have been cold and damp and dark, with only the bare\r\nground or a pile of leaves for a bed. There would probably have been\r\nbats and big spiders sharing the cave with you.\r\n\r\nYou might have had on the skin of some animal your father had killed\r\nbut as this only covered part of your body and as there was no fire,\r\nyou would have felt cold in winter, and when it got very cold you might\r\nhave frozen to death.\r\n\r\nFor breakfast you might have had some dried berries or grass-seed or a\r\npiece of raw meat, for dinner the same thing, for supper still the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nYou would never have had any bread or milk or griddle-cakes with syrup,\r\nor oatmeal with sugar on it, or apple pie or ice-cream.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do all day long but watch out for wild\r\nanimals--bears and tigers; for there was no door with lock and key, and\r\na tiger, if he found you out, could go wherever you went and “get you”\r\neven in your cave.\r\n\r\nAnd then some day your father, who had left the cave in the morning to\r\ngo hunting, would not return, and you would know he had been torn to\r\npieces by some wild beast, and you would wonder how long before your\r\nturn would come next.\r\n\r\nDo you think you would like to have lived then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nFire! Fire!! Fire!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first things are usually the most interesting--the first baby, the\r\nfirst tooth, the first step, the first word, the first spanking. This\r\nbook will be chiefly the story of first things; those that came second\r\nor third or fourth or fifth you can read about and study later.\r\n\r\nPrimitive People did not at first know what fire was. They had no\r\nmatches nor any way of making a light or a fire. They had no light\r\nat night. They had no fire to warm themselves by. They had no fire\r\nwith which to cook their food. Somewhere and sometime, we do not know\r\nexactly when or how, they found out how to make and use fire.\r\n\r\nIf you rub your hands together rapidly, they become warm. Try it. If\r\nyou rub them together still more rapidly, they become hot. If you rub\r\ntwo sticks together rapidly, they become warm. If you rub two sticks\r\ntogether very, very, very rapidly, they become hot and at last, if you\r\nkeep it up long enough and fast enough, are set on fire. The Indians\r\nand boy scouts do this and make a fire by twisting one stick against\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the first inventions, and this invention was as\r\nremarkable for them at that time as the invention of electric light in\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nPeople of the Stone Age had hair and beards that were never cut,\r\nbecause they had nothing to cut them with, even had they wanted them\r\nshort, which they probably didn’t.\r\n\r\nTheir finger-nails grew like claws until they broke off.\r\n\r\nThey had no clothes made of cloth, for they had no cloth and nothing\r\nwith which to cut and sew cloth if they had.\r\n\r\nThey had no saws to cut boards, no hammer or nails to fasten them\r\ntogether to make houses or furniture.\r\n\r\nThey had no forks nor spoons; no pots nor pans; no buckets nor shovels;\r\nno needles nor pins.\r\n\r\nThe People of the Stone Age had never seen or heard of such a thing as\r\niron or steel or tin or brass or anything made of these metals. For\r\nthousands and thousands of years Primitive People got along without any\r\nof the things that are made of metal.\r\n\r\nThen one day a Stone Age Man found out something by accident; a\r\n“discovery” we call it.\r\n\r\nHe was making a fire; and a fire, which is to us such a common,\r\nevery-day thing, was still to him very wonderful. Round his fire he\r\nplaced some rock to make a sort of camp-fire stove. Now, it happened\r\nthat this particular rock was not ordinary rock but what we now call\r\n“ore,” for it had copper in it. The heat of the fire melted some of the\r\ncopper out of the rock, and it ran out on the ground.\r\n\r\nWhat were those bright, shining drops?\r\n\r\nHe examined them.\r\n\r\nHow pretty they were!\r\n\r\nHe heated some more of the same rock and got some more copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A cave man discovering copper.]\r\n\r\nThus was the first metal discovered.\r\n\r\nAt first people used the copper for beads and ornaments, it was so\r\nbright and shiny. But they soon found out that copper could be pounded\r\ninto sharp blades and points, which were much better than the stone\r\nknives and arrow-heads they had used before.\r\n\r\nBut notice that it was not iron they discovered first, it was copper.\r\n\r\nWe think people next discovered tin in somewhat the same way. Then,\r\nafter that, they found out that tin when mixed with copper made a\r\nstill harder and better metal than either alone. This metal, made of\r\ntin and copper together, we now call bronze; and for two or three\r\nthousand years people made their tools and weapons out of bronze. And\r\nso we call the time when men used bronze tools, and bronze weapons for\r\nhunting and fighting, the Bronze Age.\r\n\r\nAt last some man discovered iron, and he soon saw that iron was better\r\nfor most useful things than either copper or bronze. The Iron Age\r\nstarted with the discovery of iron, and we are still in the Iron Age.\r\n\r\nAs people who lived in the Bronze and Iron Ages were able, after the\r\ndiscovery of metal, to do many things they could not possibly have done\r\nbefore with only stone, and as they lived much more as we do now, we\r\ncall people of the Bronze and Iron Ages “civilized.”\r\n\r\nYou may have heard in your mythology or fairy tales of a Golden Age\r\nalso, but by this is meant something quite different. The Golden Age\r\nmeans a time when everything was beautiful and lovely and everybody\r\nwise and good. There have been times in the World’s History which have\r\nbeen called the Golden Age for this reason.\r\n\r\nBut I am afraid there never has been really a golden age--only in\r\nfairy-tales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nFrom an Airplane\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople of the Bronze and Iron Ages thought the world was flat, and they\r\nknew only a little bit of the world, the small part where they lived;\r\nand they thought that if you went too far the world came to an end\r\nwhere you would\r\n\r\n  TU\r\n   M\r\n    B\r\n     L\r\n      E\r\n\r\n       O\r\n        F\r\n        F\r\n\r\nThe far-away land which nobody knew they called the Ultima Thule. This\r\nis a nice name to say--Ultima Thule, Ultima Thule--far-away Ultima\r\nThule.\r\n\r\nIf we should go up in an airplane and look down on the world at the\r\nplace where the first civilized people once lived, we should see two\r\nrivers, a sea and a gulf, and from so high up in the air they would\r\nlook something like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Mesopotamia and Mediterranean.]\r\n\r\nNow, you probably have never even heard of these rivers and seas, and\r\nyet they have been known longer than any other places in the world. One\r\nof these lines is the Tigris River, and the other is the Euphrates.\r\nThey run along getting closer and closer together until at last they\r\njoin each other and flow into what is called the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nYou might make these two rivers in the ground of your yard or garden or\r\ndraw them on the floor if your mother will let you. Just for fun you\r\nmight name your drinking-cup “Tigris” and your glass “Euphrates.” Then\r\nyou might call your mouth, into which they both empty, the “Persian\r\nGulf,” for you will hear a great many new names by and by, and as\r\ngrown-up people give names to their houses and boats, to their horses\r\nand dogs, why shouldn’t you give names to things that belong to you?\r\nFor instance, you might call your chair, your bed, your table, your\r\ncomb and brush, even your hat and shoes, after these strange names.\r\n\r\nThen, if we flew in our airplane to the west, we should see a country\r\ncalled Egypt, another river, the Nile, and a sea now named the\r\nMediterranean. Mediterranean simply means “between the land,” for this\r\nsea is surrounded by land. It is, indeed, almost like a big lake. It\r\nis supposed that long, long ago in the Stone Age, there was no water\r\nat all where this sea now is, only a dry valley, and that people once\r\nlived there.\r\n\r\nAlong the Nile in Egypt and the Tigris and Euphrates were the only\r\ncivilized nations living in the Bronze Age. The rest of the World\r\npeople knew nothing about. There may have been Cave Men living in other\r\nparts of the World, but it is only of the people in these two places\r\nthat we have any written history until after the Iron Age began.\r\n\r\nAll of the people who lived in the country of the Tigris and Euphrates\r\nwere white. We don’t know how nor when nor where colored people first\r\nlived, though it is interesting to guess. There were, we think, just\r\nthree different white families and from these three families all the\r\nwhite people in the world are descended. Yes, your family came from\r\nhere, ’way, ’way, ’way, ’way, back. So you will want to know the names\r\nof these three families and which one was your own. They were:\r\n\r\n  The Indo-Europeans, often called Aryans,\r\n          The Semites, and\r\n                The Hamites.\r\n\r\nMost of us belong to the Aryan family, some are Semites, but very few\r\nin this part of the World are Hamites.\r\n\r\nIf your name is Henry or Charles or William, you are probably an Aryan.\r\n\r\nIf it is Moses or Solomon, you are probably a Semite.\r\n\r\nIf it is Shufu or Rameses, you are probably a Hamite.\r\n\r\nThe Aryans came from higher up on the map than the other two families,\r\nwe think. They were the first people to tame wild horses and to use\r\nthem for riding and drawing carts. They also had tamed cows which they\r\nused for milk, and sheep for their wool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nReal History Begins or ’Way ’Way Back to the Time of the Gipsies\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can remember the big things that have happened in your own lifetime.\r\n\r\nAnd you have of course heard your father tell about things that\r\nhappened in his own life--how he fought the Germans in the Great War,\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\nAnd if your grandfather is still living, he can tell you still other\r\nstories of things that took place when he was a boy before even your\r\nfather was born.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps your\r\n            great,\r\n              great,\r\n                grandfather\r\n  may have been living when Washington was\r\n  President, and _his_\r\n                great,\r\n                  great,\r\n                    great,\r\n                      great,\r\n                        grandfather\r\n\r\nmay have been living when there were only wild Indians in this country.\r\n\r\nAlthough these ancestors, as they are called, are dead long since, the\r\nstory of what did happen in all their lifetimes ’way, ’way back has\r\nbeen written down in books and this story is history--“his story” one\r\nboy named it.\r\n\r\nChrist was living in the Year 1--no, not the first year of the world,\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nDo you know how many years ago that was?\r\n\r\nYou can tell if you know what year this is now.\r\n\r\nIf Christ were living to-day, how old would He be?\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred and more years may seem a long time. But perhaps you\r\nhave seen or heard of a man or a woman who was a hundred years old.\r\nHave you?\r\n\r\nWell, in nineteen hundred years only nineteen men each a hundred years\r\nold might have lived one after the other--nineteen men one after the\r\nother since the time of Christ--and that doesn’t seem so long after all!\r\n\r\nEverything that happened _before_ Christ was born is called B.C., which\r\nyou can guess are the initials of Before Christ, so B.C. stands for\r\nBefore Christ. So much is easy.\r\n\r\nEverything that has happened in the world _since_ the time of Christ is\r\ncalled A.D. This is not so easy for though A. might stand for After,\r\nwe know D. is not the initial of Christ. As a matter of fact, A. D.\r\nare the initials of two Latin words, “Anno Domini.” Anno means “in the\r\nyear,” Domini “of the Lord”; so that Anno Domini is “in the year, of\r\nthe Lord,” which in ordinary, every-day language means of course “since\r\nthe time of Christ.”\r\n\r\nThe things I have told you that I have had to guess at we call\r\nBefore-History, or _Pre-History_--which means the same thing. But the\r\nthings that have happened in the lifetime of people, who have written\r\nthem down--the stories I don’t have to guess at--we call _History_.\r\n\r\nThe first history that we feel fairly sure is really true begins with\r\nthe Hamite family. The Hamites, you remember, were one of the three\r\nfamilies of the white race I have already told you about who lived by\r\nthe Tigris and Euphrates. We think that they moved away from the Tigris\r\nand Euphrates Rivers and went down to Egypt long before history began.\r\n\r\nOf course they didn’t pack all their furniture on a big wagon and\r\nmove to Egypt, as you might move from the house where you now live to\r\nanother. They lived in tents then and not in houses at all, and they\r\nonly moved along a day’s journey at a time as campers or Gipsies might\r\ndo. In fact, Gipsy is short for Egyptian. When they got tired of one\r\nplace or had eaten up everything there was near-by, they rolled up\r\ntheir tents, packed them on camels, and moved a little farther along\r\nto a new place. And so camping here for a while, then gradually moving\r\nfarther along to the next good place and camping there, they at last\r\ngot as far off as the land we now call Egypt. When they finally reached\r\nEgypt they found it such a fine country in which to live that there\r\nthey stayed for good and were called Egyptians.\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose they found Egypt such a fine country in which to\r\nlive? It was chiefly on account of a habit of the river Nile--a bad\r\nhabit you might at first think it--a habit of flooding the country once\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nIt rains so hard in the spring that the water fills up the river Nile,\r\noverflows its banks, and spreads far out over the land, but not very\r\ndeep. It is as if you had left a water-spigot turned on and the water\r\nrunning, or had begun to water your garden with a hose, and then you\r\nhad gone off and forgotten it.\r\n\r\nBut the people know when the overflow is coming and they are glad for\r\nit to come, so they put banks around some of it so that it is stored\r\nup for watering the land during the rest of the year when there is no\r\nrain. After most of the water has dried up, it has left a layer of\r\nrich, dark, moist earth over the whole country. In this earth it is\r\neasy to grow dates, wheat, and other things which are good for food.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for this yearly overflow of the Nile, the country of\r\nEgypt would be a sandy desert in which no plant or living thing would\r\ngrow--for all plants as well as animals must have water and will die\r\nwithout it. Egypt, without water, would be like the great Sahara\r\nDesert, which is not far away. It is the Nile, therefore, that makes\r\nthe land so rich and Egypt such an easy and cheap country to live\r\nin, for food grows with little or no labor and costs almost nothing.\r\nBesides this, the climate is so warm that people need little clothing\r\nand do not have to buy coal or make fires to heat their houses. So it\r\nwas to this country that the Hamites at last came, finally settled\r\ndown, and were thereafter called Egyptians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Menes, 3400 B. C.]\r\n\r\nThe first Egyptian king whose name we know was Menes, but we do not\r\nknow much about him. We believe he built some kind of waterworks\r\nso that the people might better use the water of the Nile, and he\r\nprobably lived about 3400 B. C. He may have lived either earlier or\r\nlater, but as this is an easy date to remember, we shall take it for\r\na starting-point. You might remember it by supposing it is a telephone\r\nnumber of a person you wanted to call up:\r\n\r\nMenes, First Egyptian king . . 3400 B.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe Puzzle-Writers\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople of the Stone Age had learned how to talk to each other, but they\r\ncould not write, for there was no such thing as an alphabet or written\r\nwords, and so they could not send notes or messages to one another or\r\nwrite stories. The Egyptians were the first people to think of a way to\r\nwrite what they wanted to say.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians did not write with letters like ours, however, but with\r\nsigns that looked like little pictures, a lion, a spear, a bird, a\r\nwhip. This picture-writing was called hieroglyphics--see if you can say\r\n“Hi-e-ro-glyph-ics.” Perhaps you have seen, in the puzzle sections of\r\na newspaper, stories written in pictures for you to guess the meaning.\r\nWell, hieroglyphics were something like that.\r\n\r\nHere is the name of an Egyptian queen, whom you will hear about\r\nlater--written in hieroglyphics; her name you would never guess from\r\nthis funny writing. It is “Cleopatra.”\r\n\r\nA king’s or queen’s name always had a line drawn around it, like the\r\none you see around the above name in order to mark it more prominently\r\nand give it more importance. It was something like the square or circle\r\nyour mother may put around her initials or monogram on her letter-paper.\r\n\r\nBut there was no paper in those days and so the Egyptians wrote on the\r\nleaves of a plant called papyrus that grew in the water. It is from\r\nthis name “papyrus” that we get the name “paper.” Can you see that\r\n“paper” and “papyrus” look and sound something alike? The Egyptians’\r\nbooks were written by hand, of course, but they had no pencils nor pens\r\nnor ink to write with. For a pen they used a reed, split at the end,\r\nand for ink a mixture of water and soot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cleopatra in hieroglyphic writing.]\r\n\r\nTheir books were not made of separate pages like our books, but from\r\na long sheet of papyrus-leaves pasted together. This was rolled up to\r\nform what was called a scroll, something like a roll of wall-paper, and\r\nwas read as it was unrolled.\r\n\r\nStories of their kings and battles and great events in their history\r\nthey used to write on the walls of their buildings and monuments. This\r\nwriting they carved into the stone, so that it would last much longer\r\nthan that on the papyrus-leaves.\r\n\r\nAll the old Egyptians, who wrote in hieroglyphics and knew how to read\r\nthis writing, had died long since, and for a great many years no one\r\nknew what such writing meant. But a little over a hundred years ago a\r\nman found out by accident how to read and understand hieroglyphics once\r\nagain. This is the way he happened to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Nile separates into different streams before it flows into the\r\nMediterranean Sea. These separate streams are called mouths and one of\r\nthese mouths has been given the name “Rosetta.”\r\n\r\nOne day a man was digging nearby this Rosetta Mouth when he dug up a\r\nstone something like a tombstone with several kinds of writing on it.\r\nThe top writing was in pictures which we now call hieroglyphics, and no\r\none understood what it meant. Below this was written what was supposed\r\nto be the same story in the Greek language, and a great many people do\r\nunderstand Greek. All one had to do, therefore, to find out the meaning\r\nof the hieroglyphics, was to compare the two writings. It was like\r\nreading secret writing when we know what the letters stand for. You may\r\nhave tried to solve a puzzle in the back of your magazine, and this\r\nwas just such an interesting puzzle, only there was no one to tell the\r\nanswer in the next number.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle was not so easy as it sounds, however, for it took a man\r\nalmost twenty years to solve it. That is a long time for any one to\r\nspend in trying to solve a puzzle, isn’t it? But after this “key” to\r\nthe puzzle was found, men were able to read all of the hieroglyphics\r\nin Egypt and so to find out what happened in that country long before\r\nChrist was born.\r\n\r\nThis stone is called the Rosetta Stone, from the Rosetta Mouth of the\r\nNile where it was found. It is now in the great British Museum in\r\nLondon and is very famous, because from it we were able to learn so\r\nmuch history which we otherwise would not have known.\r\n\r\nEgypt was ruled over by a king who was called a Pharaoh. When he died\r\nhis son became the Pharaoh and so on. All the other people were divided\r\ninto classes, and the children in each class usually became just what\r\ntheir fathers had been. It was very unusual for an Egyptian to start at\r\nthe bottom and work up to the top, as a poor boy in this country may\r\ndo, though once in a great while this happened even in Egypt, as we\r\nshall see by and by.\r\n\r\nThe highest class of people were called priests. They were not like\r\npriests or ministers of the church nowadays, however, for there was\r\nno church at that time. The priests made the religion and rules, which\r\nevery one had to obey as everybody does the laws of our land.\r\n\r\nBut the priests were not only priests; they were doctors and lawyers\r\nand engineers, as well. They were the best-educated class, and they\r\nwere the only people who knew how to read and write, for it was very\r\ndifficult, as you might suppose, to learn how to read and write\r\nhieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nThe next highest class to the priests were the soldiers, and below\r\nthese were the lower classes--farmers, shepherds, shopkeepers,\r\nmerchants, mechanics, and last of all the swineherds.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians did not worship one God as we do. They believed in\r\nhundreds of gods and goddesses, and they had a special god for every\r\nsort of thing, who ruled over and had charge of that thing--a god of\r\nthe farm, a god of the home, and so on. Some of their gods were good\r\nand some were bad, but the Egyptians prayed to them all.\r\n\r\nOsiris was the chief god, and Isis was his wife. Osiris was the god of\r\nfarming and judge of the dead. Their son Horus had the head of a hawk.\r\n\r\nMany of their gods had bodies of men with heads of animals. Animals\r\nthey thought sacred. The dog and the cat were sacred animals. The\r\nibis, which was a bird like a stork, was another. Then there was the\r\nbeetle, which was called a scarab. If any one killed a sacred animal\r\nhe was put to death, for the Egyptians thought it much worse to kill a\r\nsacred and holy creature than to kill even a human being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe Tomb-Builders\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tu-tank-amen’s tomb showing foods preserved.]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians believed that when they died, their souls stayed near\r\nby their bodies. So when a person died they put in the tomb with him\r\nall sorts of things that he had used in daily life--things to eat and\r\ndrink, furniture and dishes, toys and games. They thought the soul\r\nwould return to its own body at the day of judgment. They wanted their\r\nbodies to be kept from decaying until judgment day, in order that the\r\nsoul might then have a body to return to. So they pickled the bodies\r\nof the dead by soaking them in a kind of melted tar and wrapping them\r\nround and round and round with a cloth like a bandage. A dead body\r\npickled in this way is called a mummy, and after thousands of years the\r\nmummies of the Egyptian kings may still be seen. Most of them are not,\r\nhowever, in the tombs where they were at first placed. They have been\r\nmoved away and put in museums, and we may see them there now. Although\r\nthey are yellow and dried up, they still look like\r\n\r\n  “Little old men\r\n   All skin and bones.”\r\n\r\nAt first only kings or important people of the highest classes were\r\nmade mummies, but after a while all the classes, except perhaps the\r\nlowest, were treated in the same way. Sacred animals from beetles to\r\ncows were also made into mummies.\r\n\r\nWhen an Egyptian died his friends heaped up a few stones over his body\r\njust to cover it up decently and keep it from being stolen or destroyed\r\nby those wild animals that fed on dead bodies. But a king or a rich\r\nman wanted a bigger pile of stones over his body than just ordinary\r\npeople had. So to make sure that his pile would be big enough, a king\r\nbuilt it for himself before he died. Each king tried to make his pile\r\nlarger than any one else’s until at last the pile of stones became so\r\nbig it was a hill of rocks and called a pyramid. The pyramids therefore\r\nwere tombs of the kings who built them while they were alive to be\r\nmonuments to themselves when they were dead. In fact a king was much\r\nmore interested in building a home for his dead body than he was in a\r\nhome for his live body. So, instead of palaces, kings built pyramids.\r\nThere are many of these pyramids built along the bank of the Nile, and\r\nmost of them were built, we think, just after 3000 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhen a building is being put up nowadays, men use derricks and cranes\r\nand engines to haul and raise heavy stones and beams. But the Egyptians\r\nhad no such machinery, and though they used huge stones to build the\r\npyramids, they had to drag these stones for many miles and raise them\r\ninto place simply by pushing and pulling them. The three biggest of\r\nall the pyramids are near the city of Cairo. The largest one of them,\r\nwhich is called the Great Pyramid, was built by a king named Cheops.\r\nTo remember when he lived, simply think of this as another telephone\r\nnumber:\r\n\r\n  Cheops      2900 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one hundred thousand men worked twenty years to build\r\nhis pyramid. It is one of the largest buildings in the world, and some\r\nof the blocks of stone themselves are as big as a small house. I have\r\nbeen to the top of it, and it is like climbing a steep mountain with\r\nrocky sides. I have also been far inside to the cave-like room in the\r\ncenter where Cheop’s mummy was placed. There is nothing in there now,\r\nhowever, except bats that fly about in the darkness, for the mummy has\r\ndisappeared--been stolen, perhaps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cheops building his pyramid.]\r\n\r\nNear the Pyramid of Cheops is the Sphinx. It is a huge statue of a\r\nlion with a man’s head. It is as big as a church, and though it is so\r\nbig, it has been carved out of one single rock. The rock, however, was\r\nalready there and so did not have to be carried. The Sphinx is a statue\r\nof the god of the morning, and the head is that of one of the Egyptian\r\nPharaohs who built a pyramid near that of Cheops. The desert sand has\r\ncovered the paws and most of the body. Though the sand has been dug\r\naway from time to time, the wind quickly covers the body with sand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians carved other large statues of men and women out of rock.\r\nThese figures are usually many times bigger than life-size, and sit or\r\nstand stiffly erect with both feet flat on the ground and hands close\r\nto the body in the position some children take when they “sit” for\r\ntheir photograph.\r\n\r\nThey built huge houses for their gods. These were called temples and\r\ntook the place of our churches. These temples had gigantic--that’s the\r\nway it is spelled, though it means “giant-ic”--columns and pillars.\r\nOrdinary people standing beside them look like dwarfs. Here is one of\r\nthese temples, and you can see how different it is from our churches:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian temple.]\r\n\r\nThey decorated their temples and pyramids, and the cases in which the\r\nmummies were put, with drawings and paintings. The pictures they made,\r\nhowever, looked something like those a young child might draw. For\r\nexample, when they wanted to make a picture of water, they simply made\r\na zigzag line to represent waves; when they tried to draw a row of men\r\nback of a row in front, they put those in the back _on top_ of those\r\nin front. To show that a man was a king, they made him several times\r\nlarger than the other men in the picture. When they painted a picture\r\nthey used any color they thought was pretty, usually blue or yellow or\r\nbrown. Whether the person or thing was really that color or not made no\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nA Rich Land Where There Was No Money\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have read in fairy-tales of a land where cakes and candy and\r\nsugar-plums grow on trees, where everything you want to eat or to play\r\nwith can be had just by picking it. Well, long, long ago people used to\r\nthink there had been really such a country, and where do you suppose\r\nthey said it was? Somewhere near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers--those\r\nrivers with the strange names I asked you to learn--and they called\r\nthis spot the Garden of Eden. We do not know exactly where it was, for\r\nthere is no such place now quite as wonderful as the Garden of Eden was\r\nsupposed to be.\r\n\r\nEgypt was a land of one river, the Nile. The land of the Two Rivers had\r\nseveral names.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose we are flying over the country in an airplane and\r\nlooking down at the land between these two rivers. It is called\r\nMesopotamia, which is two Greek words simply meaning “Between the\r\nRivers.”\r\n\r\nSee the land over there by the upper Tigris. It is called _Assyria_.\r\n\r\nSee the land near where the rivers join each other. That is called\r\n_Babylonia_.\r\n\r\nSee the land near where they empty. That is called _Chaldea_.\r\n\r\nAnd see over there is _Mount Ararat_, where it is supposed Noah’s Ark\r\nrested after the flood.\r\n\r\nHere are a lot of new names. A young friend of mine had a train of toy\r\ncars. He had noticed that the Pullman cars on which he had ridden had\r\nnames, and so he gave his toy cars names also. He called them:\r\n\r\n  ASSYRIA    MESOPOTAMIA\r\n    BABYLONIA     ARARAT\r\n      CHALDEA        EUPHRATES\r\n\r\nBabylonia was a very rich country, for the two rivers brought down\r\nand dropped great quantities of earth just as the Nile did in Egypt,\r\nand this made very rich soil. Wheat, from which we make bread, is\r\ncalled the staff of life. It is the most valuable of all foods which\r\ngrow. It is supposed that wheat first grew in Babylonia. Dates in\r\nthat part of the world are almost as important a food as wheat.\r\nDates, too, grow there very plentifully. Now, you may think dates are\r\nsomething to be eaten almost like candy but in Babylonia dates took the\r\nplace of oatmeal. In the rivers there were quantities of good fish,\r\nand as fishing was just fun, you see that the people who lived in\r\nBabylonia--the Babylonians, as they were called--had plenty of good\r\nfood without having to do much work for it. No one had any money in\r\nthose days; people had cows and sheep and goats, and a man was rich who\r\nhad much of these “goods.” But if a man wanted to buy or sell, he had\r\nto buy or sell by trading something he had for something he wanted.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in Babylonia the people built a great tower called the _Tower\r\nof Babel_, which you have probably heard about. It was more like a\r\nmountain than a tower. They built other towers, too. Some say the Tower\r\nof Babel and towers like it were built so that the people might have\r\na high place to which they could climb in case of another flood. But\r\nothers give a different reason. They say that the people who built\r\nthese towers came to Babylonia from farther north where there were\r\nmountains. In this northern land they had always placed their altars\r\non the top of a mountain, to be close to heaven. So when they moved\r\nto a flat country like Mesopotamia and Babylonia, where there were no\r\nmountains, they _built_ mountains in order to have a high place for the\r\naltar on top. To reach the top of these mountains or towers, they made,\r\ninstead of a staircase on the inside, a slanting roadway that wound\r\naround the outside in somewhat the way a road winds around a mountain.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any stone either in or near Babylonia as there was in\r\nEgypt, and so the Babylonians built their buildings of bricks, which\r\nwere made of mud formed into blocks and dried in the sun. In the course\r\nof time, bricks of this sort crumble and turn back into dust again just\r\nas mud pies that you might make would do. This is the reason why all\r\nthat is left of the Tower of Babel and the other buildings that were\r\nput up so long ago are now simply hills of clay into which the brick\r\nhas turned.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians wrote on papyrus or carved their history in stone, but\r\nthe Babylonians had neither papyrus nor stone. All they had were\r\nbricks. So they wrote on bricks before they were dried, while they\r\nwere still soft clay. This writing was made by punching marks into the\r\nclay with the end of a stick. It was called _cuneiform_, which means\r\nwedge-shaped, for it looked like little groups of wedge-shaped marks,\r\nlike chicken-tracks, made in the mud. I have seen boys’ writing that\r\nlooked more like cuneiform than it did like English.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians as they watched their flocks by night and by day\r\nwatched also the sun and the moon and the stars moving across the sky.\r\nSo they came to know a great deal about these heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see the moon in the daytime?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, you can.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babylonians watching eclipse.]\r\n\r\nWell, every once in a great while the moon as it moves across the sky\r\ngets in front of the sun and shuts out its light--just as, if you\r\nshould put a white plate in front of an electric light, the electric\r\nlight would be darkened. It may be ten o’clock in the morning and broad\r\ndaylight when suddenly the sun is covered up by the moon as by a white\r\nplate and it becomes night and the stars shine out and chickens,\r\nthinking it is night, go to roost. But in a few moments the moon passes\r\nby and the sun shines out once again. This is called an _eclipse_ of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nNow you probably have never seen an eclipse of the sun, but some day\r\nyou may. At that time, and even to-day when ignorant people see an\r\neclipse of the sun, they think that something dreadful is going to\r\nhappen--the end of the world, perhaps, just because they have never\r\nseen such a strange sight before and do not know that it is a thing\r\nthat happens regularly and that no harm comes from it.\r\n\r\nWell, nearly twenty-three hundred years before Christ, 2300 B. C., the\r\nBabylonians told beforehand just when there was going to be an eclipse\r\nof the sun. They had watched the moon moving across the sky and they\r\nhad figured out how long it would be before it would catch up with the\r\nsun and cross directly over it. So you see how much the old Babylonians\r\nknew about such things. Men who study the stars and other heavenly\r\nbodies are called astronomers, and the Babylonians, therefore, were\r\nfamous astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians worshiped animals; but it was quite natural that the\r\nBabylonians should worship these wonderful heavenly bodies, the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars, and they did.\r\n\r\nThe first king of Babylonia whom we know much about--and that much is\r\nvery little--was Sargon I, who may have lived about the same time that\r\nthe pyramids were built in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAbout 2100 B. C. Babylonia had a king known far and wide for the laws\r\nhe made. His name was Hammurabi, and we still have the laws he made\r\nthough we no longer obey them; for they were carved into a stone in\r\ncuneiform, and we have the stone. Sargon and Hammurabi are strange\r\nnames like no one’s name you ever heard before, yet they are real names\r\nof real kings who ruled over real people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jews\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are” spells “Ur.” It is one of the shortest names I know. It is\r\nthe name of a little place in that part of Babylonia called Chaldea. In\r\nthis place--about nineteen hundred years B.C.--there lived a man named\r\nAbraham. Abraham had a very large family and though he had no money he\r\nwas rich. He had large herds of sheep and goats, and these were the\r\nchief riches in those days. Now, Abraham believed in one God, as we do,\r\nwhile his neighbors, the Babylonians, worshiped idols and the heavenly\r\nbodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, as I have just said. Abraham\r\ndid not like his neighbors for this reason; and his neighbors didn’t\r\nlike him, either, for they thought his ideas were peculiar or even\r\ncrazy. So, about nineteen hundred years before Christ, Abraham took\r\nhis large family, his flocks, and his herds and moved to a land called\r\nCanaan, far away on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nAbraham lived to be a very old man, and he had a large family. One of\r\nhis grandsons named Jacob, who was also known by the name of Israel,\r\nhad a son Joseph. You probably remember the Bible story of Jacob’s\r\nfavorite son Joseph with the coat of many colors. Joseph’s brothers\r\nwere jealous of him, as boys and even dogs are apt to be jealous of\r\nany one who is liked better than they are. So they put Joseph into a\r\nwell and then sold him as a slave to some Egyptians who were passing\r\nby. Then they told their father Jacob that Joseph had been killed by\r\nwild animals. The Egyptians took Joseph to far-off Egypt--far away from\r\nCanaan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abraham leaving Ur. 1900 B.C.]\r\n\r\nBut although Joseph was a slave in Egypt, and although, as I told you,\r\nit was very difficult for any one to work his way up out of his class\r\nto a higher class, he was so bright that at last he became one of the\r\nrulers in Egypt.\r\n\r\nNow, at that time when he was ruler there came a famine in Canaan and\r\nthere was no food. In Egypt, however, there was plenty of food stored\r\nup. So Joseph’s wicked brothers went down to Egypt to beg the rulers\r\nfor bread. They probably thought by that time their brother was dead.\r\nThey did not know that he had become such a great man and that he was\r\nnow the ruler of whom they were begging food. You can imagine how\r\nsurprised they were and how ashamed they must have felt when they found\r\nout that the great ruler was their own brother, whom they had planned\r\nto kill and then had sold as a slave.\r\n\r\nJoseph might have let his brothers starve to death or put them in\r\nprison, or sent them back to Canaan without anything, if he had wanted\r\nto revenge himself on them. But instead of doing any of these things,\r\nhe gave them not only all the food they wanted and more to take back\r\nhome, but made them rich presents besides. Then he told them to go back\r\nand get the rest of his family and return with them to Egypt, and he\r\npromised to give them a piece of land called Goshen where there would\r\nbe no famines and they might live happily. So they did as they were\r\ntold, and Israel and his sons and all their families came down and\r\nsettled in Goshen about 1700 B.C. They were called Israelites, which\r\nmeans of course the children of Israel, and they believed they were\r\nGod’s chosen people. These are the people we now call the Jews.\r\n\r\nAfter Joseph, who was of course an Israelite himself, died, the kings\r\nor Pharaohs of Egypt did not like these foreign people who belonged to\r\nthe Semite family, and treated them very badly, as other peoples have\r\nalways treated the Jews badly ever since. Though the Jews and their\r\nsons and sons’ sons lived in Egypt for about four hundred years, they\r\nwere always hated by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nNow about four hundred years from the time the Jews first came into\r\nEgypt--400 from 1700 is 1300 B.C.--there was a ruler of Egypt called\r\nRameses the Great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rameses’ mummy.]\r\n\r\nRameses so hated the Jews that finally he gave orders to have every\r\nJewish boy baby killed. In this way he thought to get rid of these\r\npeople. One little Jewish boy named Moses, however, was saved, and when\r\nhe grew up he became the greatest leader of his people. Moses wanted to\r\nget the Jews out of this unfriendly country where the people worshiped\r\nfalse gods. And so at last he led all his people out of Egypt across\r\nthe Red Sea. This was called the Exodus, and it took place about 1300\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rameses the Great.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Jews had left Egypt they first stopped at the foot of a\r\nmountain called Mount Sinai, while Moses went up to the top where he\r\ncould be by himself and learn what God wanted him and the Jews to do.\r\nMoses spent forty days praying on top of the mountain. When he came\r\ndown from the mountain-top, he brought with him the Ten Commandments,\r\nthe same Ten Commandments you may have learned in Sunday-school. But\r\nMoses had been gone so long that when he came back again to his people\r\nhe found them worshiping a golden calf as the Egyptians had done. They\r\nhad lived in Egypt until they had come to think it was all right to\r\nworship idols.\r\n\r\nMoses was very angry. It was high time, he thought, that they should\r\nget rid of the bad influence of their old Egyptian neighbors. And at\r\nlast he succeeded in making them worship God again and gave them the\r\nTen Commandments for their rule of life. So Moses is called a lawgiver\r\nand the founder of the Jewish religion. Then Moses died, and the Jews\r\nwandered from place to place for a great many years before they finally\r\nsettled in Canaan.\r\n\r\nThe Jews had no kings. They were ruled by men called judges, but the\r\njudges lived very simply, just like every one else and not like kings\r\nin palaces with servants and fine robes and rich jewels. But the Jews\r\nwanted a real king as their enemies had and other nations who were\r\ntheir neighbors. Strange they wanted a king which so many countries\r\nhave tried to get rid of--we should think they would have preferred a\r\nPresident as we have.\r\n\r\nSo at last a judge who was named Samuel said they should have a king,\r\nand Saul was chosen. Then Samuel poured olive-oil over Saul’s head.\r\nThis may seem a queer thing to do, but it took the place of putting\r\na crown on his head and was a sign that he was to be king. Samuel,\r\ntherefore, was the last one of their judges, and Saul was their first\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAll other nations at that time believed as the Egyptians and Chaldeans\r\ndid, in fairy-tale gods or idols. But the Jews alone believed in one\r\nGod. They had a Holy Book which had been written by their prophets.\r\nThis book is the Old Testament part of the Christian Bible.\r\n\r\nSo this is the story of the Wandering Jews who gave us the Old\r\nTestament and the Ten Commandments, and here is the way they wandered:\r\n\r\n  From Ur to Canaan--1900 B.C.\r\n\r\n  From Canaan to Egypt--1700 B.C.\r\n\r\n  From Egypt back to Canaan--1300 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nFairy-Tale Gods\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man named Hellen--strange-sounding name for a man,\r\nisn’t it? He was not a Semite and not a Hamite. He was an Aryan. He\r\nhad a great many children and children’s children, and they called\r\nthemselves Hellenes. They lived in a little scrap of a country that\r\njuts out into the Mediterranean Sea, and they called their land Hellas.\r\nI once upset a bottle of ink on my desk, and the ink ran out into a\r\nwriggly spot that looked exactly as Hellas does on the map. Though\r\nHellas is hardly any bigger than one of our States, its history is more\r\nfamous than that of any other country of its size in the world. We call\r\nHellas “Greece” and the people who lived there “Greeks.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Jews were leaving Egypt, about the time when\r\npeople were beginning to use iron instead of bronze, that is, about\r\n1300 B.C., we first begin to hear of Hellas and the Hellenes, of Greece\r\nand the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks believed in many gods, not in one God as we do and as the\r\nJews did, and their gods were more like people in fairy-tales than\r\nlike divine beings. Many beautiful statues have been made of their\r\ndifferent gods, and poems and stories have been written about them.\r\n\r\nThere were twelve--just a dozen--chief gods. They were supposed to\r\nlive on Mount Olympus, which was the highest mountain in Greece. These\r\ngods were not always good, but often quarreled and cheated and did\r\neven worse things. The gods lived on a kind of food that was much more\r\ndelicious than what we eat. It was called nectar and ambrosia, and the\r\nGreeks thought it made those who ate it immortal; that is, so that they\r\nwould never die.\r\n\r\nLet me introduce you to the family of the gods. I know you will be\r\npleased to meet them. Most of them have two names.\r\n\r\n _Jupiter or Zeus_ is the father of the gods and the the king who rules\r\n over all human beings. He sits on a throne and holds a zigzag flash\r\n of lightning called a thunderbolt in his hand. An eagle, the king of\r\n birds, is usually by his side.\r\n\r\n _Juno or Hera_ is his wife and therefore queen. She carries a scepter,\r\n and her pet bird, the peacock, is often with her.\r\n\r\n _Neptune or Poseidon_ is one of the brothers of Jupiter. He rules over\r\n the sea. He rides in a chariot drawn by sea-horses and carries in his\r\n hand a trident, which looks like a pitchfork with three points. He\r\n can make a storm at sea or quiet the waves simply by striking them\r\n with his trident.\r\n\r\n _Vulcan or Hephæstus_ is the god of fire. He is a lame blacksmith and\r\n works at a forge. His forge is said to be in the cave of a mountain,\r\n and as smoke and fire come forth from some mountains they are called\r\n volcanoes after the god Vulcan inside.\r\n\r\n _Apollo_ is the most beautiful of all the gods. He is the god of the\r\n sun and of song and music. Every morning--so the Greeks said--he\r\n drives his sun-chariot across the sky from the east to the west, and\r\n this makes the sun-lighted day.\r\n\r\n _Diana or Artemis_ is the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of\r\n the moon and of hunting.\r\n\r\n _Mars or Ares_ is the terrible god of war, who is only happy when a\r\n war is going on--so that he is happy most of the time.\r\n\r\n _Mercury or Hermes_ is the messenger of the gods. He has wings on\r\n his cap and on his sandals, and he carries in his hand a wonderful\r\n winged stick or wand, which, if placed between two people who are\r\n quarreling, will immediately make them friends. One day Mercury saw\r\n two snakes fighting and he put his wand between them, whereupon they\r\n twined around it as if in a loving hug, and ever since the snakes have\r\n remained entwined around it. This wand is called a _caduceus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birth of Minerva or Athene.]\r\n\r\n _Minerva or Athene_ is the goddess of wisdom. She was born in a very\r\n strange way. One day Jupiter had a terrible headache--what we call a\r\n “splitting” headache. It got worse and worse, until at last he could\r\n stand it no longer, but he took a very strange way to cure it. He\r\n called Vulcan, the lame blacksmith, and told him to hit him on the\r\n head with his hammer. Though Vulcan must have thought this a funny\r\n request, of course he had to obey the father god. So he struck Jupiter\r\n a terrible blow on the head, whereupon there sprang forth Minerva in\r\n all her armor, and the headache, of which she had been the cause, had\r\n gone. So she was born from his brain, that is why she is the goddess\r\n of wisdom. Minerva’s Greek name is Athene, and she founded a great\r\n city in Greece and named it after herself, Athens. She is supposed to\r\n look out for this city as a mother does for her child.\r\n\r\n _Venus or Aphrodite_ is the goddess of love and beauty. She is the\r\n most beautiful of the goddesses as Apollo is the most beautiful of the\r\n gods. She is said to have been born from the sea-foam. Cupid, her son,\r\n is a little chubby boy with a quiver of arrows on his back. He goes\r\n about shooting his invisible arrows into the hearts of human beings,\r\n but instead of dying when they are hit they at once fall in love\r\n with some one. That is why we put hearts with arrows through them on\r\n valentines.\r\n\r\n _Vesta_ is the goddess of the home and fireside, who looks out for the\r\n family.\r\n\r\n _Ceres or Demeter_ is the goddess of the farmer. These are the twelve\r\n gods of the Olympian family.\r\n\r\n _Pluto_ is a brother of Jupiter. He rules the world underground and\r\n lives down there.\r\n\r\nThere are many other less important gods and goddesses as well as some\r\ngods that are half human, such as the three Fates and three Graces and\r\nthe nine Muses.\r\n\r\nSome of the planets in the sky which look like stars are still called\r\nby the names of these Greek gods. Jupiter is the name of the largest\r\nplanet. Mars is the name of one that is reddish--the color of blood.\r\nVenus is the name of one that is very beautiful. There is also a\r\nMercury and a Neptune.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us to understand how the Greeks could have prayed to\r\nsuch gods as these, but they did. Their prayers, however, were not like\r\nours. Instead of kneeling and closing their eyes as we do, they stood\r\nup and stretched their arms straight out before them. They did not pray\r\nto be forgiven for their sins and to be made better. They prayed for\r\nvictory over their enemies or to be protected from harm.\r\n\r\nWhen they prayed they often made the god an offering of animals, fruit,\r\nhoney, or wine in order to please him so that he would grant their\r\nprayer. The wine they poured out on the ground, thinking the god would\r\nlike to have them do this. The animals they killed and then burned by\r\nbuilding a fire under them on an altar. This was called a sacrifice.\r\nTheir idea seemed to be that even though the gods could not eat the\r\nmeat of the animals nor drink the wine themselves, they liked to have\r\nsomething _given up_ for them. And so even to-day we say a person makes\r\na sacrifice when he _gives up_ something for another.\r\n\r\nWhen the Greeks were sacrificing they usually looked for some sign from\r\nthe god to see whether he was pleased or not with the sacrifice and\r\nwhether he would answer their prayer and do what they asked him or not.\r\nA flock of birds flying overhead, a flash of lightning, or any unusual\r\nhappening they thought was a sign which meant something. Such signs\r\nwere called “omens.” Some omens were good and showed that the god would\r\ndo what he was asked, and some omens were bad and showed he would not.\r\nOmens were very much like some of the signs that people believe in even\r\nto-day when they say it is a good sign or good luck if you see the new\r\nmoon over the right shoulder or a bad sign or bad luck if you spill the\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nNot so very far from Athens is a mountain called Mount Parnassus. On\r\nthe side of Mount Parnassus was a town called Delphi. In the town of\r\nDelphi there was a crack in the ground, from which gas came forth,\r\nsomewhat as it does from cracks in a volcano. This gas was supposed to\r\nbe the breath of the god Apollo, and there was a woman priest called a\r\npriestess who sat on a three-legged stool or tripod over the crack so\r\nas to breathe the gas. She would become delirious, as some people do\r\nwhen they are sick with fever and we say they are “out of their heads,”\r\nand when people asked her questions she would mutter strange things and\r\na priest would tell what she meant. This place was called the Delphic\r\nOracle, and people would go long distances to ask the oracle questions,\r\nfor they thought Apollo was answering them.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks went to the oracle whenever they wanted to know what to\r\ndo or what was going to happen, and they firmly believed in what the\r\noracle told them. Usually, however, the answers of the oracle were like\r\na riddle, so that they could be understood in more than one way. For\r\ninstance, a king who was about to go to war with another king asked the\r\noracle who would win. The oracle replied, “A great kingdom will fall.”\r\nWhat do you suppose the oracle meant? Such an answer, which you can\r\nunderstand in two or three ways, is still called “oracular.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nA Fairy-Tale War\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of countries usually begins--and also ends--with war.\r\nThe first great happening in the history of Greece was a war. It was\r\ncalled the Trojan War and was supposed to have taken place about twelve\r\nhundred years before Christ, or not long after the beginning of the\r\nIron Age. But we are not only not sure of the date; we are not even\r\nsure that there ever was such a war, for a great deal of it, we know,\r\nis simply fairy-tale. This is the way the tale goes.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a wedding feast of the gods and goddesses on Mount\r\nOlympus, when suddenly a goddess who had not been invited threw a\r\ngolden apple on the table. On the apple was written these words:\r\n\r\n  To the Fairest.\r\n\r\nThe goddess who had thrown the apple was the goddess of quarreling; and\r\ntrue to her name she _did_ start a quarrel, for each of the goddesses,\r\nlike vain human beings, thought she was the fairest and should have\r\nthe apple. At last they called in a shepherd boy named Paris to decide\r\nwhich was the fairest.\r\n\r\nEach goddess offered Paris a present if he would choose her. Juno, the\r\nqueen of the gods, offered to make him a king; Minerva, the goddess of\r\nwisdom, offered to make him wise; but Venus, the goddess of beauty,\r\noffered to give him the most beautiful girl in the world for his wife.\r\n\r\nNow, Paris was not really a shepherd boy but the son of Priam, the king\r\nof Troy, which was a city on the sea-shore opposite Greece. Paris when\r\na baby had been left on a mountain to die, but had been found by a\r\nshepherd and brought up by him as his own child.\r\n\r\nParis didn’t care about being wise; he didn’t care about being king;\r\nwhat he did want was to have the most beautiful girl in the world for\r\nhis wife, and so he gave the apple to Venus.\r\n\r\nNow the most beautiful girl in the world was named Helen, and she was\r\nalready married to Menelaus, the king of Sparta. But in spite of that\r\nfact Venus told Paris to go to Sparta in Greece, where he would find\r\nHelen, and then run away with her. So Paris went to Sparta to visit\r\nKing Menelaus and was royally entertained by him. And then Paris,\r\nalthough he had been treated so kindly and been trusted, one night\r\nstole Helen away and carried her off across the sea to Troy. Though\r\nthis was in the Iron Age, it was the way a Cave Man of the Stone Age\r\nmight have acted.\r\n\r\nMenelaus and the Greeks were naturally very angry and immediately\r\nprepared for war and sailed off for Troy to get Helen back. Now, in\r\nancient times all cities had walls built around them to protect them\r\nfrom the enemy. As there were no cannons nor guns nor deadly weapons\r\nsuch as are used in war nowadays, it was very hard to get into a walled\r\ncity or capture it. Troy was protected in this way with walls; and\r\nthough the Greeks tried for ten years to capture it, at the end of the\r\nten years Troy was still unconquered.\r\n\r\nSo at last the Greeks decided to try a trick to get into the city.\r\nThey built a huge horse of wood, and inside this wooden horse they put\r\nsoldiers. They placed the horse in front of the city walls and then\r\nsailed away as if at last they were giving up the war. The Trojans were\r\ntold by a spy that the horse was a gift of the gods and that they ought\r\nto take it into the city. A Trojan priest named La-oc-o-on, however,\r\ntold his people not to have anything to do with the horse, for he\r\nsuspected a trick. But people seldom take advice when told _not_ to do\r\nwhat they want to do.\r\n\r\nJust then some huge snakes came out of the sea and attacked Laocoon\r\nand his two sons and, twining round them, strangled them to death. The\r\nTrojans thought this was a sign from the gods, or an omen as they would\r\nhave said, that they should not believe Laocoon; so they determined to\r\ntake the horse into the city against his advice. The horse was so big,\r\nhowever, that it would not go through the gates, and in order to get it\r\ninside of the walls they had to tear down part of the wall itself. When\r\nnight fell, the Greek soldiers came out of the horse and opened the\r\ngates of the city. The other Greeks, who had been waiting just out of\r\nsight, returned and entered through the gates and the hole the Trojans\r\nhad made in the wall. Troy was easily conquered then, and the city was\r\nburned to the ground, and Helen’s husband carried her back to Greece.\r\nFor reason of this horse trick, we still have a saying, “Beware of the\r\nGreeks bearing gifts,” which is as much as to say, “Look out for an\r\nenemy who makes you a present.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the Trojan War was told in two long poems. Some people\r\nthink they are the finest poems that were ever written. One of these\r\npoems is called the “Iliad,” from the name of the city of Troy, which\r\nwas also known as Ilium. The “Iliad” describes the Trojan War itself.\r\nThe other poem is called the “Odyssey” and describes the adventures\r\nof one of the Greek heroes on his way home after the war was over.\r\nThis Greek hero’s name was Odysseus, which gives the name Odyssey to\r\nthe book, but he was also called Ulysses. These poems, the “Iliad” and\r\nthe “Odyssey,” were composed by a blind Greek poet named Homer, who is\r\nsupposed to have lived about two hundred years after the war; that is\r\nabout 1000 B.C.\r\n\r\nHomer was a bard; that is, a singing poet who went about from place to\r\nplace and sang his poems to the people. Usually a bard played on the\r\nlyre as he sang, and the people gave him something to eat or a place to\r\nsleep to pay him for his songs. Nowadays, instead of a Homer singing\r\nthe “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” we have the organ-grinder and street piano\r\nplaying their tunes in front of our houses.\r\n\r\nHomer never wrote down his poems, for he was blind; but the people were\r\nvery fond of hearing his songs, and they learned them by heart, and\r\nmothers taught them to their children after Homer had died. At last,\r\nmany years later, another man wrote the poems down in Greek, and you\r\nmay some day read them in Greek, if you study that language, or at\r\nleast in an English translation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Greeks thought so much of Homer, he could hardly make a\r\nliving, and he almost had to beg his daily bread. After his death\r\nhowever, the people of nine different cities each proudly said that\r\nHomer was born in their city. And so some one has made this rime:\r\n\r\n  Nine cities claimed blind Homer dead,\r\n  Through which, alive, he’d begged his bread.\r\n\r\nSome people now doubt that there ever was a poet named Homer. Others\r\nthink that instead of only one man there must have been several men,\r\nperhaps nine, who composed these poems, and this might explain how he\r\ncould be born in nine different cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nThe Kings of the Jews\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the blind beggar Homer was singing his wonderful songs through\r\nthe streets of Greece, a great king of the Jews was singing other\r\nwonderful songs in Canaan. This king was named David, and he wasn’t\r\nborn a king. He was only a shepherd boy in King Saul’s army. This is\r\nthe way he happened to become king.\r\n\r\nAt first, as you remember, the Jews had no kings; but they had asked\r\nfor kings, and at last they were given one by the name of Saul.\r\n\r\nDavid had killed the giant Goliath. We all love this Bible story\r\nbecause we are always glad when the skilful little chap beats the\r\ngreat, big, bragging bully.\r\n\r\nWell, King Saul had a daughter, and she fell in love with this brave\r\nand athletic young David the Giant-Killer, and at last they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nSo after Saul died David became king, and he was the greatest king the\r\nJews ever had. Although Saul had been king he had lived in a tent, not\r\nin a palace, and he didn’t even have a capital city.\r\n\r\nSo David conquered a city in Canaan called Jerusalem and made this city\r\nthe capital of the Jews.\r\n\r\nBut David was not only a brave warrior and a great king; he wrote\r\nbeautiful songs as well.\r\n\r\nThe blind beggar Homer sang of his fairy-tale gods. The great King\r\nDavid sang of his one God.\r\n\r\nThese songs are the Psalms, which you hear read and sung in church.\r\n\r\nNowadays even a popular song is popular for only a few months, but\r\nthe songs which David wrote almost three thousand years ago are still\r\npopular to-day! The Twenty-third Psalm, which starts, “The Lord is my\r\nshepherd,” is one of the most beautiful and a good one to learn by\r\nheart. David likens himself to a sheep and his Lord to a good shepherd\r\nwho tenderly looks out for the comfort and safety of his sheep.\r\n\r\nDavid’s son was named Solomon, and when David died Solomon became king.\r\n\r\nIf a good fairy had asked you what you would rather have than anything\r\nin the world, I wonder what you would have chosen. When Solomon became\r\nking, God is said to have appeared to him in a dream and asked him what\r\nhe would rather have than anything else in the world. Instead of saying\r\nhe wanted to be made rich or powerful, Solomon asked to be made wise,\r\nand God said He would make him the wisest man that ever lived. Here is\r\na story that shows how wise he was.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time two women came to Solomon with a baby, and each woman\r\nsaid the baby was her own child. Solomon called for a sword and said,\r\n“Cut the baby in two, and give each a half.” One of the women cried out\r\nto give the baby to the other rather than do this, and Solomon then\r\nknew who was the real mother and ordered the baby to be given to her.\r\n\r\nSolomon built a magnificent temple made of cedar-wood from the famous\r\nforest of Lebanon, and of marble and gold and studded with jewels. Then\r\nhe built himself a wonderful palace, which was so gorgeous and splendid\r\nthat people came from all over the world to see it. The Bible tells us\r\njust how large this temple and palace were, not in feet but in cubits.\r\nA cubit was the distance from a man’s elbow to the end of his middle\r\nfinger, which is about one foot and a half.\r\n\r\nThe queen of Sheba, among others, came a long distance across Arabia to\r\nhear the wise sayings of Solomon and see his palace and the temple he\r\nhad built.\r\n\r\nAlthough the palace and temple were considered extraordinarily\r\nmagnificent at that time, you must remember that this was a thousand\r\nyears before Christ.\r\n\r\nSolomon’s temple and palace have disappeared long since, and there\r\nis left of them neither stick nor stone. But his wise sayings are\r\npreserved in every language and read by every people in every part of\r\nthe world. There are thousands of buildings now in the world that would\r\nmake his palace, if still standing, look like a child’s toy-house. But\r\nno one has ever been able to say any better the things he said. Do\r\nyou think you could? Suppose you try. Here are some of them. They are\r\ncalled proverbs.\r\n\r\n A soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.\r\n\r\n  What’s that mean?\r\n\r\n A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor\r\n rather than silver and gold.\r\n\r\n  What’s that mean?\r\n\r\n Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth.\r\n\r\n  What’s that mean?\r\n\r\nSolomon was the last great king the Jews ever had. After he died the\r\nJewish nation gradually broke up and went to pieces, and the great\r\nJewish people are to-day without a king, without a capital, and without\r\na country of their own, but are found in every other country of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nThe People Who Made Our A B C’s\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before people knew how to write, there lived a carpenter named\r\nCadmus. One day he was at work on a house when he wanted a tool that\r\nhe had left at home. Picking up a chip of wood, he wrote something on\r\nit and, handing it to his slave, told him to go to his home and give\r\nthe chip to his wife, saying that it would tell her what he wanted. The\r\nslave, wondering, did as he was told. Cadmus’s wife looked at the chip,\r\nand without a word handed the tool to the amazed slave, who thought the\r\nchip in some mysterious way had spoken the message. When he returned to\r\nCadmus with the tool, he begged for the remarkable chip, and when it\r\nwas given him, hung it around his neck for a charm.\r\n\r\nThis is the story the Greeks told of the man they say invented the\r\nalphabet. We believe, however, that Cadmus was a mythical person, for\r\nthe Greeks liked to make up such stories, and we think no _one_ man\r\nmade the alphabet. But Cadmus was a Phenician and we do know that the\r\nPhenician people invented the alphabet. You probably call it your A B\r\nC’s, but the Greeks had much harder names for the letters. They called\r\n_A_ “alpha,” _B_ “beta,” and so on. So the Greek boy spoke of learning\r\nhis “alpha beta,” and that is why we call it the “alphabet.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cadmus’ slave and the chip.]\r\n\r\nYou may never have heard of Phenicia or the Phenician people. Yet, if\r\nthere had been no such country as Phenicia, you might now be learning\r\nat school to read and write in hieroglyphics or in cuneiform.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, you know, people had very clumsy ways of writing.\r\nThe Egyptians had to draw pictures, and the Babylonians made writing\r\nlike chicken-tracks. The alphabet that the Phenicians invented had\r\ntwenty-two letters, and from it we get the alphabet we use to-day.\r\n\r\nOf course, we do not use just the same alphabet now that the Phenicians\r\ndid, but some of the letters are almost, if not quite, like those we\r\nnow have after three thousand years. For instance the\r\n\r\n  Phenician A was written on its side--(sideways A)\r\n            E  “    “     backward--Ǝ\r\n            Z  “    “  just the same--Z\r\n            O  “    “    “   “    “ --O\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians lived next door to the Jews; in fact they belonged to\r\nthe same family--the Semites. Their country was just north of the\r\nkingdom of the Jews; that is, above it on the map and lying along the\r\nshore of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians had a great king named Hiram who lived at the same time\r\nas Solomon. In fact, Hiram was a friend of Solomon and sent him some\r\nof his best workmen to help build a temple at Jerusalem. And yet Hiram\r\nhimself and the Phenicians did not believe in the Jewish God.\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians worshiped idols, terrible monsters named Baal and\r\nMoloch, which they called gods of the sun. They also believed in a\r\ngoddess of the moon named Astarte and made sacrifices of live children\r\nto her idol, Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum; this is a real story and not a fairy-tale.\r\nJust suppose you had been a child then!\r\n\r\nThe Jews, as we have learned, were very religious, but their neighbors,\r\nthe Phenicians, though Semites and therefore relatives, were business\r\npeople and thought of nothing but money, money, money--all the time.\r\nAnd they were not particular how they earned it, whether honestly or\r\nnot. Nowadays, dealers know that they must be honest if they are to\r\nbe very successful, but the Phenicians were usually tricky in their\r\ntrading with people. They always drove a good bargain and sometimes\r\neven cheated when they had a chance.\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians made many things to sell, and then they went far and\r\nnear to sell them.\r\n\r\nThey knew how to make beautiful cloth and glassware and objects in gold\r\nand silver and ivory.\r\n\r\nThey knew the secret of making a wonderful purple dye from the body of\r\na little shell-fish that lived in the water near the city of Tyre. This\r\ndye was known as Tyrian purple from the name of that city, and it was\r\nso beautiful that kings’ robes were colored with it.\r\n\r\nTyre and Sidon were the two chief cities of Phenicia, and once upon a\r\ntime they were two of the busiest cities in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to find people to sell to, the Phenicians traveled in boats\r\nall over the Mediterranean Sea and even went outside this sea into the\r\nGreat Ocean. This opening is now called the Strait of Gibraltar but\r\nwas then known as the Pillars of Hercules. They went as far as the\r\nBritish Isles. Other people in those days had not dared to go so far\r\nin boats; they thought they would come to the edge of the ocean and\r\ntumble off. But the Phenicians had no such fear, and so they were the\r\ngreatest sailors as well as the greatest traders of their times. Their\r\nships were built from the cedar-trees that grew on the slopes of their\r\nhills, which were called Lebanon.\r\n\r\nWherever the Phenicians found good harbors for their boats, they\r\nstarted little towns where they traded with the natives, who at that\r\ntime were almost savage. With ignorant savages they found they could\r\ndrive a good bargain. For a few glass beads or a piece of purple dyed\r\ncloth worth very little they could get in return gold and silver and\r\nother things worth a great deal. On the African coast, one of these\r\ntowns they started was called Carthage. Of Carthage we shall hear more\r\nby and by, for it grew to be so wealthy and important that--but wait\r\nuntil I come to that story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nHard as Nails\r\n\r\n\r\nOur story goes back again to Greece, the land of Homer and the\r\nfairy-tale gods and to Sparta, where Helen once lived.\r\n\r\nAbout nine hundred years before Christ was born, there lived in Sparta\r\na man named Lycurgus. That is a hard name, and when you hear about this\r\nman you may think he was hard, too. Lycurgus wanted his city to be the\r\ngreatest in the world.\r\n\r\nBut first he had to find out what it was that made a city and a people\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nSo he started off and traveled for years and years visiting all the\r\nchief countries of the world to see if he could learn what it was that\r\nmade them great. And this is what he learned.\r\n\r\nWherever the people thought chiefly of fun and pleasure, of amusing\r\nthemselves and having a good time--he found they were not much good,\r\nnot much account--_not_ great.\r\n\r\nWherever the people thought chiefly of hard work and did what they\r\nought, whether it was pleasant or not, he found they were usually good\r\nfor something--some account--great.\r\n\r\nSo Lycurgus came back to his home Sparta and set to work to make a\r\nset of rules which he thought would make his people greater than all\r\nother people in the world. These rules were called a Code of Laws, and\r\nI think you’ll agree they were very hard, and they made the Spartans\r\nhard, too--as “hard as nails.” We shall see whether they made the\r\nSpartans really great, also.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, babies, as soon as they were born, were examined to see\r\nthat they were strong and perfect. Whenever one was found that did not\r\nseem to be so, he was put out on the mountain-side and left to die.\r\nLycurgus wanted no weaklings in Sparta.\r\n\r\nWhen boys were seven years old, they were taken from their mothers and\r\nput in a school, which was more like a soldiers’ camp than a school,\r\nand they never lived anywhere else until they were sixty years old.\r\n\r\nIn this school they were not taught the things you are, but only the\r\nthings that trained them to be good soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere were no such things as school-books then.\r\n\r\nThere were no spelling-books.\r\n\r\nThere were no arithmetics.\r\n\r\nThere were no geographies. No one knew enough about the world to write\r\na geography.\r\n\r\nThere were no histories. No one knew much about things that had\r\nhappened in the world before that time, and of course none of the\r\nhistory since then that you now study had taken place.\r\n\r\nAt certain times, the Spartan boy was whipped, not because he had\r\ndone anything wrong, but just to teach him to suffer pain without\r\nwhimpering. He would have been disgraced forever if he had cried, no\r\nmatter how badly he was hurt.\r\n\r\nHe was exercised and drilled and worked until he was ready to drop.\r\nBut still he was obliged to keep on, no matter how tired or hungry or\r\nsleepy or aching he might be, and he must never show by any sign how he\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nHe was made to eat the worst kind of food, to go hungry and thirsty\r\nfor long periods of time, to go out in the bitter cold with little or\r\nno clothing, just to get used to such hardships and able to bear all\r\nsorts of discomforts. This kind of training, this kind of hardening, is\r\ntherefore called “Spartan discipline.” How do you think you would have\r\nliked it?\r\n\r\nThe Spartans’ food, clothing, and lodging were all furnished them,\r\nthough it was very poor food and poor clothing and poor lodging. They\r\nwere not allowed good things to eat, soft beds to lie on, or fine\r\nclothing to wear. Such things were called luxuries, and luxuries,\r\nLycurgus thought, would make people soft and weak, and he wanted his\r\npeople hard and strong.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans were even taught to speak in a short and blunt manner;\r\nthey were taught not to waste words; they must say what they had to say\r\nin as few words as possible. This manner of speaking we call “Laconic”\r\nfrom the name Laconia, the state in which Sparta was located.\r\n\r\nOnce a king wrote to the Spartans a threatening letter, saying that\r\nthey had better do what he told them to, for _if_ he came and took\r\ntheir country, he would destroy their city and make them slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans sent a messenger back with their answer, and when the\r\nletter was opened, it contained only one word:\r\n\r\n“_IF!_”\r\n\r\nEven to-day, we call such an answer, short but to the point, a Laconic\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nDid all this hard training and hard work make the Spartans the greatest\r\npeople in the world?\r\n\r\nLycurgus did make the Spartans the strongest and best fighters in the\r\nworld--but--\r\n\r\nThe Spartans conquered all the peoples around about them, though there\r\nwere ten times as many--but--\r\n\r\nThey made these people their slaves, who did all their farming and\r\nother work--but--\r\n\r\nWe shall see later whether Lycurgus’s idea was right.\r\n\r\nNorth of Sparta was another great city of Greece called Athens. There\r\nwere, of course, many other towns in Greece, but Sparta and Athens\r\nwere the most important. In Athens the people lived and thought quite\r\ndifferently from those in Sparta.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were just as fond of everything beautiful as the Spartans\r\nwere of discipline and of everything military.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians loved athletic games of all sorts just as the Spartans\r\ndid, but they also loved music and poetry and beautiful statues,\r\npaintings, vases, buildings, and such things that are known as the\r\n“arts.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenians believed in training the mind _as well_ as the body. The\r\nSpartans believed the training of the body was the all-important thing.\r\nWhich do you like better, the Athenians’ idea or the Spartans’ idea?\r\n\r\nOnce at a big game a very old man was looking for a seat on the\r\nAthenians’ side. There was no seat empty, and no Athenian offered to\r\ngive him one. Whereupon the Spartans called to the old man and gave him\r\nthe best seat on their side. The Athenians cheered the Spartans to show\r\nhow fine they thought this act. At this the Spartans said:\r\n\r\n“The Athenians _know_ what is right but they don’t _do_ it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nThe Crown of Leaves\r\n\r\n\r\nGreek boys and young men and even girls loved all sorts of outdoor\r\nsports.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t play football or baseball or basketball, but they ran and\r\njumped and wrestled and boxed and threw the discus--a thing like a big,\r\nheavy dinner-plate of iron.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time matches were held in different parts of Greece to see\r\nwho was the best in these sports.\r\n\r\nThe Big Meet, however, took place only once every four years at a\r\nplace called Olympia in southern Greece; and these Olympic games, as\r\nthey were called, were the most important affairs held in Greece, for\r\nall the winners from different parts of the country were here matched\r\nagainst each other to see who should be the champion of all Greece.\r\n\r\nThe time when the games were held was a great national holiday, for\r\nthe games were in honor of the head god Jupiter, or Zeus as the Greeks\r\ncalled him. People came from all over the known world to see the games\r\nmuch as they do now when a World’s Fair is held or a big football game.\r\n\r\nOnly Greeks could enter this contest, and only those who had never\r\ncommitted a crime or broken any laws--as a boy nowadays must have a\r\nclean record in order to be allowed to play on his college or school\r\nteam.\r\n\r\nIf there happened to be a war going on at the time, and there usually\r\nwas, so important was this holiday that a truce was declared, and\r\neverybody went off to the games. Nothing could be allowed to interfere\r\nwith the games, and even war was not as important. “Business before\r\npleasure!” When the games were finished, they started fighting again!\r\n\r\nThe Greek boys and young men would train for four years getting ready\r\nfor this big event, and then nine months before the great day they\r\nwould go to Olympia to get in training at an open-air gymnasium near\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nThe games lasted five days and began and ended with a parade and\r\nprayers and sacrifices to the Greek gods, beautiful statues to whom\r\nwere placed all about the field, for this was not only sport, but a\r\nreligious service in honor of Jupiter and the other gods.\r\n\r\nThere were all sorts of matches--in running, jumping, wrestling,\r\nboxing, chariot-racing, and throwing the discus.\r\n\r\nAny one who cheated would have been put out and never again allowed to\r\ntake part. The Greek believed in what we call being a good sport. He\r\ndidn’t brag if he won. He didn’t make excuses if he lost; he didn’t cry\r\nout that the decision was unfair.\r\n\r\nThe athlete who won one or more of these games was the hero of all\r\nGreece, and in particular of the town from which he came. The winner\r\nreceived no money prize but was crowned with a wreath made of laurel\r\nleaves. This he valued much more than an athlete nowadays does the\r\nsilver cup or gold medal he may win. Besides receiving the laurel\r\nwreath, the winner had songs written to him by poets, and often statues\r\nwere made of him by sculptors.\r\n\r\nThere were not only athletic matches but contests between poets and\r\nmusicians to see who could write the best poetry or compose and play\r\nthe sweetest music on a kind of small harp called the lyre. The winners\r\nof these contests did not receive a laurel wreath, but they were\r\ncarried in triumph on the shoulders of the throng, as you may have\r\nseen the captain of a winning team picked up and raised aloft by his\r\nfellow-players after he has won.\r\n\r\nNow, in Greek History the first event which we can be absolutely sure\r\nis true is the record of the winner of a foot-race in these Olympic\r\nGames 776 years before Christ was born. And from this event the Greeks\r\nbegan to count their history dates, as we do now from the birth of\r\nChrist. It was their Year 1.\r\n\r\nThe four years’ time between the Olympic Games was called an Olympiad.\r\nUp to this time, they had no calendar that gave the year or date,\r\nso 776 is the date of the first Olympiad. Greek History before that\r\ntime may have been partly true, but we know much of it was mythical.\r\nBeginning with 776, however, Greek history is pretty much all true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek runner.]\r\n\r\nAfter a long while they stopped having the games, but a few years ago\r\nit was thought it would be a good thing to start them again. So, for\r\nthe first time since before Christ, new Olympic Games were again held\r\nin 1896 A.D., not in Olympia, however, but in Athens. The games used\r\nto be held only in Greece. Now they are held each time in a different\r\ncountry. Only Greeks used to be allowed to take part. Now, however,\r\nathletes from almost all the countries of the world are invited to\r\ncompete. War used to be stopped when the time for the games arrived.\r\nNow the games are stopped when war is on.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have learned of the Spartans’ training, we might guess\r\nthat they used to win most of the athletic prizes, and they did.\r\n\r\nDo the Spartans still continue to win most of the prizes in the New\r\nOlympic Games?\r\n\r\nNo. Not even the Greeks now carry off the chief prizes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nA Bad Beginning\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard of the Seven-League Boots, the boots in which one\r\ncould take many miles at a single step?\r\n\r\nWell, there is a still bigger boot; it is over five hundred miles long,\r\nand it is in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nNo, it’s not a real boot, but it would look like one if you were miles\r\nhigh in an airplane and looking down upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is called Italy.\r\n\r\nSomething very important happened in Italy, not long after the First\r\nOlympiad in Greece. It was so important that it was called the Year 1,\r\nand for a thousand years people counted from it as the Greeks did from\r\nthe First Olympiad, and as we do now from the birth of Christ. This\r\nthing that happened was not the birth of a man, however. It was the\r\nbirth of a city, and this city was called Rome.\r\n\r\nThe history of Rome starts with stories that we know are fairy-tales\r\nor myths in the same way that the history of Greece does. Homer told\r\nabout the wanderings of the Greek, Odysseus. A great many years later a\r\npoet named Vergil told about the wanderings of a Trojan named Æneas.\r\n\r\nÆneas fled from Troy when that city was burning down and started off to\r\nfind a new home. Finally after several years he came to Italy and the\r\nmouth of a river called the Tiber. There Æneas met the daughter of the\r\nman who was ruling over that country, a girl by the name of Lavinia,\r\nand married her, and they lived happily ever after. So the children of\r\nÆneas and Lavinia ruled over the land, and they had children, and their\r\nchildren had children, and their children had children, until at last\r\nboy twins were born. These twins were named Romulus and Remus. Here\r\nendeth the first part of the story and the trouble begins, for they did\r\nnot live happily ever after.\r\n\r\nAt the time the twins were born, a man had stolen the kingdom, and he\r\nfeared that these two boys might grow up and take his stolen kingdom\r\naway from him. So he put the twins in a basket and set them afloat on\r\nthe river Tiber, hoping that they might be carried out to sea or upset\r\nand be drowned. This, he thought, was nearly all right, so long as he\r\ndidn’t kill them with his own hands. But the basket drifted ashore\r\ninstead of going out to sea or upsetting, and a mother wolf found the\r\ntwins and nursed them as if they were her own babies. And a woodpecker\r\nalso helped and fed them berries. At last a shepherd found them and\r\nbrought them up as if they were his own sons until they grew up and\r\nbecame men. This sounds a good deal like the story of Paris who was\r\nleft out to die and was found and brought up by a shepherd also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Romulus and Remus with the wolf.]\r\n\r\nEach of the twins then wished to build a city. But they could not agree\r\nwhich one was to do it, and in quarreling over the matter, Romulus\r\nkilled his own twin brother Remus. Romulus then built the city by the\r\nTiber River, on the spot where he and his brother had been saved and\r\nnursed by the mother wolf. Here there were seven hills. This was in\r\n753 B.C., and he named the city Roma after his own name, and the people\r\nwho lived there were called Romans. So that is why, ever afterward,\r\nthe Roman kings always said they were descended from the Trojan hero,\r\nÆneas, the great-great-great-grandfather of Romulus.\r\n\r\nDon’t you believe this story? Neither do I. But it is such an old, old\r\nstory every one is supposed to have heard it even though it is only a\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nIn order to get people for the city which he had started, it is said\r\nthat Romulus invited all the thieves and bad men who had escaped from\r\njail to come and live in Rome, promising them that they would be safe\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen as none of the men had wives, and there were no women in his new\r\ncity, Romulus thought up a scheme to get the men wives. He invited some\r\npeople called Sabines, who lived near-by, both men and women, to come\r\nto Rome to a big party.\r\n\r\nThey accepted, and a great feast was spread. In the middle of the\r\nfeast, when every one was eating and drinking, a signal was given, and\r\neach of the Romans seized a Sabine woman for his wife and ran off with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe Sabine husbands immediately prepared themselves for war against the\r\nRomans, who had stolen their wives. When the battle had begun between\r\nthe two armies, the Sabine women ran out in the midst of the fighting\r\nbetween their new and old husbands and begged them both to stop. They\r\nsaid they had come to love their new husbands and would not return to\r\ntheir old homes.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of that?\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a pretty bad beginning for a new city, doesn’t it? and\r\nyou may well wonder how Rome turned out--a city that started with\r\nRomulus killing his brother and that was settled by escaped prisoners\r\nwho stole the wives of their neighbors. We must remember, however, that\r\nthen they were nearer the time when Primitive Men lived whose only rule\r\nof life was: kill or be killed, steal or be stolen; and whose usual way\r\nof getting wives was to knock them in the head and drag them off to\r\ntheir caves while they were senseless. Besides, they believed in the\r\nsame gods as the Greeks, and we have heard how their gods did all sorts\r\nof wicked things themselves. This, too, was long before Christ was\r\nborn, and at that time they did not know anything about the Christian\r\nreligion or what we call right and wrong.\r\n\r\nYou see I have tried to think of some good excuses for the actions of\r\nthese first Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nKings with Corkscrew Curls\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Rome’s bad start she had one king after another, and some of\r\nthese kings were pretty good and some were pretty bad.\r\n\r\nBut the most important city in the world at this time was far away from\r\nRome on the Tigris River. This city was called Nineveh, and here lived\r\nthe kings of the country called Assyria, which I told you about some\r\ntime ago.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the chief thing we hear about Assyria and the Assyrians is\r\nthat they were fighting with their neighbors. This, however, was not\r\nthe fault of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian kings who lived in Nineveh wanted more land and power,\r\nand so they fought their neighbors in order to take their land away\r\nfrom them. These kings had long corkscrew curls, and you may think\r\nthat only girls wear long curls and that a man with curls would be\r\n“girl-like.” But these kings were not at all that kind. They were such\r\nterrible fighters that they were feared far and near. They treated\r\ntheir prisoners terribly; they skinned them alive, cut off their ears,\r\npulled out their tongues, bored sticks into their eyes, then bragged\r\nabout it. They made the people whom they conquered pay them huge sums\r\nof money and promise to fight with them whenever they went to war.\r\n\r\nAnd so Assyria became so strong and powerful that she at last owned\r\neverything of importance in the world, the land between the rivers\r\ncalled Mesopotamia, and the land to the east, north, and south, and\r\nPhenicia, and Egypt, and pretty nearly everything except Greece and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThis big, big country of Assyria was ruled by the kings at Nineveh,\r\nwho lived in great magnificence. They built wonderful palaces for\r\nthemselves, and on each side of the way that led to the palace they\r\nplaced rows of huge statues of bulls and lions with wings and men’s\r\nheads as a rich man nowadays might plant a row of trees along the\r\ndriveway that leads up to his home. These winged animals are what are\r\ncalled cherubs in the Bible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard a particularly sweet and pretty little baby\r\ncalled a cherub. Isn’t it strange that these hideous Assyrian monsters\r\nshould be called cherubs also?\r\n\r\nWhen the Assyrian kings were not fighting men they were fighting wild\r\nanimals, for they were very fond of hunting with bow and arrow, and\r\nthey had pictures and statues made of themselves on horseback or in\r\nchariots fighting lions. Often they would capture the animals they\r\nhunted alive and put them in cages so that the people could come and\r\nsee them. This was something like a “zoo” such as we have nowadays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Assyrian cherub.]\r\n\r\nThe rulers of Assyria had very strange names. Sennacherib was one of\r\nthe most famous. Sennacherib lived about 700 B.C. Once upon a time\r\nSennacherib was fighting Jerusalem. His whole army was camped one\r\nnight when as they lay asleep something happened, for when the morning\r\ncame, none woke up; all were dead, both men and horses. An English poet\r\nnamed Byron has written a poem called “The Destruction of Sennacherib”\r\ndescribing this event. Perhaps they were poisoned; what do you think?\r\n\r\nAssur-bani-pal was another king who ruled later--about 650 B.C. He was\r\na great fighter too, but he was also very fond of books and reading;\r\nso Assur-bani-pal started the first public library. The books in that\r\nfirst public library were, however, very peculiar. Of course they were\r\nnot printed books, and they were not even made of paper. They were\r\nmade of mud with the words pressed into the clay before it dried. This\r\nwriting was cuneiform, which I have already told you about. The books\r\nwere not arranged in bookcases, either, but were placed in piles on the\r\nfloor. They were, however, kept in careful order and numbered so that a\r\nperson who wanted to see a book in the library could call for it by its\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nAssyria reached the height of her power during the reign of Sennacherib\r\nand Assur-bani-pal, and everything in Nineveh was so lovely for the\r\nNinevites that the time when Assur-bani-pal reigned was called the\r\nGolden Age.\r\n\r\nBut although everything in Nineveh was so lovely for the Ninevites,\r\neverywhere else the Assyrians were hated and feared, for their armies\r\nbrought death and destruction wherever they went.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that not long after Assur-bani-pal died, two of the\r\nneighbors of Nineveh could stand it no longer. These two neighbors\r\nwere the king of Babylon, who lived south, and a people called the\r\nMedes, who lived to the east and belonged to the Aryan family. So the\r\nking of Babylon and the Medes got together and attacked Nineveh, and\r\ntogether they wiped that city off the face of the earth. This was\r\nin 612 B.C.--Six-One-Two--and the power of Nineveh and Assyria was\r\nkilled dead. This, therefore is called the Fall of Nineveh, the end of\r\nNineveh. We might put up a tombstone:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nA City of Wonders and Wickedness\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king of Babylon had beaten Nineveh. But he didn’t stop with that.\r\nHe wanted his Babylon to be as great as Nineveh had been. So he went\r\non conquering other lands to the left and right until Babylon, in its\r\nturn, became the leader and ruler of other countries. Was Babylon,\r\nalso, in its turn, to fall, as Nineveh had fallen?\r\n\r\nWhen at last the king of Babylon died, he left his vast empire to his\r\nson. Now, the king’s son was not called John or James or Charles or\r\nanything simple like that. It was--Nebuchadnezzar, and I wonder if his\r\nfather called him by all that long name or shortened it to a nickname\r\nlike “Neb,” for instance, or “Chad,” or perhaps “Nezzar.” This is the\r\nway Nebuchadnezzar wrote his name, for he used cuneiform writing. How\r\nwould you like to write your name in such a queer way?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Name of Nebuchadnezzar in cuneiform writing.]\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar set to work and made the city of Babylon the largest,\r\nthe most magnificent and the most wonderful city of that time and\r\nperhaps of any time. The city was in the shape of a square and covered\r\nmore ground than the two largest cities in the world to-day--New York\r\nand London--put together. He surrounded it with a wall fifty times as\r\nhigh as a man--fifty times--whew!--and so broad that a chariot could\r\nbe driven along on the top, and in this wall he made one hundred huge\r\nbrass gates. The Euphrates River flowed under the wall, across the\r\ncity, and out under the wall on the other side.\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar could not find any one in Babylon who was beautiful\r\nenough to be his queen. The Babylonian girls must have felt pretty\r\nbad--or mad--about that. So he went to Media, the country that had\r\nhelped his father conquer Nineveh. There he found a lovely princess,\r\nand so he married her and brought her home to Babylon.\r\n\r\nNow, Media was a land of hills and mountains, whilst Babylon was on\r\nlevel ground and without even a hill in sight. Nebuchadnezzar’s queen\r\nfound Babylonia so flat and uninteresting that she became homesick,\r\nand she longed for her own country with its wild mountain scenery.\r\nSo, just to please her and keep her contented Nebuchadnezzar set to\r\nwork and _built_ a hill for her, but the queer thing was he built it\r\non top of the roof of his palace! On the sides of this hill he made\r\nbeautiful gardens, and these gardens he planted not only with flowers\r\nbut also with trees, so that his queen might sit in the shade and enjoy\r\nherself. These were called Hanging Gardens. The Hanging Gardens and the\r\ntremendous walls were known far and wide as one of the Seven Wonders of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWould you like to know what the other Wonders were?\r\n\r\nWell, the pyramids in Egypt were one; the magnificent statue of Jupiter\r\nat Olympia, where the Olympic Games were held, was another--so those\r\nwith the Hanging Gardens make three.\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar believed in idols like those terrible monsters the\r\nPhenicians worshiped. The Jews away off in Jerusalem believed in one\r\nGod. Nebuchadnezzar wanted the Jews to worship his gods, but they would\r\nnot. He also wanted them to pay him taxes, and they would not. So he\r\nsent his armies to Jerusalem, destroyed that city, burnt the beautiful\r\nTemple that Solomon had built, and brought the Jews and all their\r\nbelongings to Babylon. There in Babylon Nebuchadnezzar kept the Jews\r\nprisoners, and there in Babylon the Jews remained prisoners for fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBabylon had become not only the most magnificent city in the world; it\r\nhad become also the most wicked. The people of Babylon gave themselves\r\nup to the wildest pleasures. Their only thought seemed to be, “Let’s\r\neat, drink, and be merry”; they thought nothing of the morrow; the more\r\nwicked the pleasure the more they liked it.\r\n\r\nBut although Nebuchadnezzar seemed able to do and able to have\r\neverything in the world he wanted, he finally went crazy. He thought\r\nhe was a bull, and he used to get down on his hands and knees and eat\r\ngrass, imagining he was a beast of the field.\r\n\r\nAnd Babylon, in spite of its tremendous walls and brass gates, was\r\ndoomed. Babylon was to be conquered. It didn’t seem possible. How could\r\nit be conquered, and who was to do the conquering? You would probably\r\nnever guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nA Surprise Party\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I was always told, and you have probably been told the\r\nsame thing:\r\n\r\n“You can have no dessert until you have eaten your dinner.”\r\n\r\nNo matter whether I was hungry or not, “No dinner, no dessert.” This\r\nwas a rule which my father said was “like the laws of the Medes and\r\nPersians.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t know then who the Medes and Persians were, but I know now\r\nthat they were two Aryan families living next to Babylon--you remember\r\nNebuchadnezzar had married a Median girl--and that they were governed\r\nby laws which were fixed so hard and fast and were so unchangeable that\r\nwe still speak of any such thing that does not change as like “the laws\r\nof the Medes and Persians.”\r\n\r\nThe Medes and the Persians had a religion which was neither like that\r\nof the Jews nor like the idol worship of the Babylonians. It had been\r\nstarted by a Persian named Zoroaster, who was a wise man like Solomon.\r\nHe may even have lived about the same time as Solomon, but probably a\r\ngood deal later.\r\n\r\nZoroaster went about among the people, teaching them wise sayings and\r\nhymns. These wise sayings have been gathered into a book, which is now\r\nthe Persian Bible.\r\n\r\nZoroaster taught that there were two great spirits in the world, the\r\nGood Spirit and the Bad Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Good Spirit, he said, was Light, and the Bad Spirit, Darkness.\r\nThe Good or Light he called Mazda; where have you heard that word, I\r\nwonder. So the Persians kept a fire, in which they thought was the Good\r\nSpirit, constantly burning on their altars, and they had men watch\r\nover this flame to see that it never went out. These men who watched\r\nthe flame were called Magi, and they were supposed to be able to do\r\nall sorts of wonderful things, so that we call such wonderful things\r\n“magic,” and the people who are able to do them we call “magicians.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of this story which I’m telling you, the ruler of the Medes\r\nand the Persians was a great king named Cyrus.\r\n\r\nBut before I go on with this story I must tell you about a little\r\ncountry not far from Troy. This little country was called Lydia.\r\nPerhaps you may know a girl named Lydia. I do. Lydia was ruled over\r\nby a king named Crœsus who was the richest man in the world. When we\r\nwant to describe a man as very wealthy, we still say he is “as rich as\r\nCrœsus.”\r\n\r\nCrœsus owned nearly all the gold-mines, of which there were a great\r\nmany in that country, and besides this he collected money in the form\r\nof taxes from all the cities near him.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of Crœsus people did not have money such as we have\r\nnow. When they wished to buy anything, they simply traded something\r\nthey had for something they wanted--so many eggs for a pound of meat or\r\nso much wine for a pair of sandals. To buy anything expensive, such as\r\na horse, they paid with a lump of gold or silver, which was weighed in\r\nthe scales to see just how heavy it was. It is hard for us to think how\r\npeople could get along without cents and nickels, dimes, quarters and\r\ndollars--with no money at all--and yet they did.\r\n\r\nCrœsus, in order to make things simpler, cut up his gold into small\r\nbits. Now, it was not easy for every one to weigh each piece each time\r\nit was traded, for he might not have any scales handy. So Crœsus had\r\neach piece weighed and stamped with its weight and with his name or\r\ninitials to show that he guaranteed the weight. These pieces of gold\r\nand silver were only lumps with Crœsus’ seal pressed into them, but\r\nthey were the first real money even though they were not round and\r\nbeautifully engraved like our coins.\r\n\r\nNow, Cyrus, the great Persian king, thought he would like to own this\r\nrich country of Lydia with all its gold-mines, so he set out to conquer\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen Cyrus was on the way Crœsus sent in a hurry to the oracle in\r\nGreece to ask what was going to happen and who was going to win. You\r\nwill remember what I said about the oracle at Delphi and how people\r\nused to ask the oracle questions--to have their fortunes told, as\r\nnowadays some people ask the ouija board.\r\n\r\nThe oracle replied to Crœsus’ question:\r\n\r\n“A great kingdom shall fall.”\r\n\r\nCrœsus was delighted, for he thought the oracle meant that Cyrus’\r\nkingdom would fall. The oracle _was_ right, but not in the way Crœsus\r\nhad thought.\r\n\r\nA great kingdom did fall, but it was his own kingdom of Lydia and not\r\nCyrus’ that fell.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus was still not satisfied with the capture of Lydia, and so at\r\nlast he attacked Babylon.\r\n\r\nNow, the people in Babylon who thought of nothing but pleasure were\r\nbusy feasting and drinking and having a good time. Why should they\r\nworry about Cyrus? Their city had walls that were so high and thick and\r\nwas protected by such strong gates of brass that it seemed as if no one\r\ncould possibly have captured it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Delphic Oracle.]\r\n\r\nBut you remember that the Euphrates River ran beneath the walls\r\nand crossed right through the city. Well, one night when the young\r\nprince of Babylon named Belshazzar was having a gay party and enjoying\r\nhimself, feeling quite certain that no one could enter the city, Cyrus\r\nmade a dam and turned the waters of the river to one side. Then Cyrus’\r\narmy marched into the city through the dry river-bed and captured the\r\nsurprised Babylonians without even a fight. It is supposed that some of\r\nthe Babylonian priests helped him to do this and even opened the gates,\r\nfor Babylon had become so wicked that they thought it time for it to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOld Lycurgus would have said: “I told you so. People who think of\r\nnothing but pleasure never come to a good end.”\r\n\r\nThis surprise party was in 538--5 and 3 are 8.\r\n\r\nTwo years later Cyrus let the Jews, who had been carried away fifty\r\nyears before from Jerusalem, return to the home of their fathers, thus\r\nending the Babylonian Captivity.\r\n\r\nTo-day the only thing left of this great city of Babylon, which was\r\nonce bigger than New York and London together--Babylon the Wicked,\r\nBabylon the Magnificent, Babylon with all its great walls and brass\r\ngates and Hanging Gardens--is only a mound of earth. A few miles away\r\nis a ruined tower. This tower, we think, may once have been the Tower\r\nof Babel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nThe Other Side of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nThere used to be a “missionary box” in my Sunday-school, and into this\r\nbox we dropped our pennies to send a missionary to the heathen.\r\n\r\nThe heathen, we were told, were people who lived on the other side of\r\nthe world and worshiped idols.\r\n\r\nThere was the heathen “Chinee,” the heathen “Japanee,” and the heathen\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nThese heathen Indians were not our American Indians. They lived in a\r\ncountry called India on the other side of the world. India looks on the\r\nmap like the little thing that hangs down in the back of your mouth\r\nwhen the doctor says: “Stick out your tongue. Say ’Ah.’” Our Indians\r\nare red, but the Indians from India are white. The white Indians belong\r\nto the Aryan family, the same family that Cyrus belonged to.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years before the time of Cyrus, an Aryan family had moved\r\naway from the other Aryan families in Persia until they had come to\r\nthis country we now call India.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time there came to be four chief classes of people in\r\nIndia, four chief classes of society--high society, low society, and\r\ntwo classes of society in between. These classes were called castes,\r\nand no one in one caste would have anything to do with one in another\r\ncaste. A boy or girl in one caste would never play with a boy or girl\r\nin another caste. A man from one caste would never marry a woman in\r\nanother. No one from one caste would eat with one in another caste,\r\neven though he were starving. Men in different castes were even afraid\r\nof touching each other in passing on the street. It was almost as if\r\nthey were afraid of catching some horrible disease.\r\n\r\nThe highest caste of all were the Fighters and Rulers. The Rulers were\r\nthe Fighters, and the Fighters were the Rulers, for they had to be\r\nfighters in order to keep their rule.\r\n\r\nIn the next caste were the Priests; and, as in the case of the Egyptian\r\npriests, these men were not what we think of as priests nowadays. They\r\nwere what we should call professional men--doctors, lawyers, engineers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNext came the farmers and tradespeople--the butcher, the baker, and\r\ncandlestick maker.\r\n\r\nFourth and last were the common laborers. These were the men who knew\r\nnothing and could do nothing but dig or chop wood or carry water.\r\n\r\nBelow these four castes were still other people so low and mean that\r\nthey were called outcastes or Pariahs. We now call any person who has\r\ndone something so disgraceful that no one, not even the lowest, will\r\nhave anything to do with him a “pariah.”\r\n\r\nThe people in India believed in a god whom they called Brahma, and so\r\nwe call their religion Brahmanism. The Brahmanists believed that when\r\na person died his soul was born again in the body of another person or\r\nperhaps of an animal. If he had been good while alive they thought his\r\nsoul went into the body of a higher caste man when he died--as if he\r\nwere promoted from one grade to the next. If, however, he had led a bad\r\nlife they thought his soul went into the body of a lower caste man or\r\neven of an animal.\r\n\r\nWhen a man died, his body was not buried, it was burned. If he were\r\na married man, his wife was obliged to throw herself alive upon the\r\nburning flames. She was not allowed to live after her husband was dead.\r\nIf the wife died, that was another matter; the man simply got another\r\nwife. In the Brahman temples were hideous idols, which the people\r\nworshiped as gods. These idols had several heads apiece or many arms,\r\nor many legs, or they had tusks sticking out of their mouths--or they\r\nhad horns coming out of their heads.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 500 B.C. there was born a prince in India by the name of\r\nGautama. Gautama saw so much suffering and trouble in the world that\r\nhe felt it was not right that he himself, just because he by chance\r\nhad been born rich, should be happy while others were miserable and\r\nunhappy. So he gave up the life to which he had been born and brought\r\nup, a life of ease and luxury with all its good things, and spent his\r\nentire time trying to make things better for his people.\r\n\r\nGautama taught the people to be good; he taught them to be honest; and\r\nhe taught them to help the poor and unfortunate. After a while people\r\nbegan to call him Buddha, and he was so holy and pure that at last they\r\nthought he must be god himself, and so they worshiped him as god.\r\n\r\nThese people who believed in Buddha were called Buddhists, and many,\r\nmany Brahmanists left their hideous idols and became Buddhists. You see\r\nthere was no such thing as a Christian religion as yet, for this was\r\nstill five hundred years before Christ was born, and Buddhism seemed so\r\nmuch better than Brahmanism that we do not wonder that great numbers of\r\npeople became Buddhists.\r\n\r\nBuddhists thought their religion was so good that they wanted everyone\r\nto become Buddhists; so they sent missionaries across country and sea\r\nto the island of Japan just as we send Christian missionaries now, and\r\nthis new religion spread far and wide.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have never met nor seen nor even heard of a Buddhist, and\r\nyet to-day there are many more Buddhists on the other side of the world\r\nthan there are Christians!\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Gautama was starting Buddhism in India, a man\r\nin China, a teacher by the name of Confucius, was teaching the people\r\nof China what they ought to do and what they ought not to do. His\r\nteachings filled several books and formed what came to be a religion\r\nfor the Chinese.\r\n\r\nConfucius taught his people to obey their parents and teachers and\r\nto honor their ancestors. This sounds something like one of the Ten\r\nCommandments: “Honor thy father and thy mother.”\r\n\r\nConfucius also taught the golden rule, the same golden rule you are\r\ntaught to-day, only instead of saying, “_Do_ unto others as you would\r\nbe done by,” he said, “Do _not_ do to others what you would _not_ want\r\nothers to do to you.”\r\n\r\nIn China there are still as many people who follow the teachings of\r\nConfucius as there are Christians in all the rest of the world. So here\r\nare two religions each as large or larger than the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nChina was highly civilized, even at this time, 500 B.C., and many\r\ninventions were known and used in that country long before the rest of\r\nthe world ever heard of them. Yet we know little of China’s history\r\nuntil a great deal later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nRich Man, Poor Man\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever I pass a group of street boys playing ball, I almost always\r\nhear some one shout, “That’s no fair!”\r\n\r\nThere always seem to be some players who think the others are not\r\nplaying fair. Sides are always quarreling.\r\n\r\nThey need an umpire.\r\n\r\nWhen Athens was young there were two sides among the people--the rich\r\nand the poor, the aristocrats and the common people--and they were\r\nalways quarreling. Each side was trying to get more power, and each\r\nside said the other wasn’t playing fair.\r\n\r\nThey needed an umpire.\r\n\r\nAthens had had kings, but the kings took the side of the rich, and so\r\nat last the Athenians had kicked out the last king, and after that they\r\nwould have no more kings.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 600 B.C. things became so very bad that a man named\r\nDraco was chosen to make a set of rules for the Athenians to obey.\r\nThese rules he made were called the Code of Draco.\r\n\r\nDraco’s Code made terrible punishments for any one who broke the rules.\r\nIf a man stole anything, even as small a thing as a loaf of bread, he\r\nwas not just fined or sent to jail; he was put to death! And no matter\r\nhow small the wrong a man had done, he was put to death for it. Draco\r\nexplained the reason for such a severe law by saying that a thief\r\ndeserved to be put to death and should be. A man who killed another\r\ndeserved _more_ than to be put to death, but unfortunately there was no\r\nworse punishment to give him.\r\n\r\nYou can understand how much trouble the laws of Draco caused. They were\r\nso hard that a little later another man was called upon to make a new\r\nset of laws. This man was named Solon, and his laws were very just and\r\ngood. We now call senators and other people who make our laws “Solons”\r\nafter this man Solon who lived so long ago, even though their laws are\r\nnot always just and good.\r\n\r\nStill the people were not satisfied with Solon’s laws. The upper\r\nclasses thought the laws gave too much to the lower classes, and the\r\nlower classes thought they gave too much to the upper. Both classes,\r\nhowever, obeyed the laws for a while, although both classes complained\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nBut about 560 B.C. a man named Pisistratus stepped in and took charge\r\nof things himself. He was not elected nor chosen by the people. He\r\nsimply made himself ruler, and he was so powerful that no one could\r\nstop him. It was as if a boy made himself captain or umpire without\r\nbeing chosen by those on the teams.\r\n\r\nThere were others from time to time in Greece who did the same thing,\r\nand they were called tyrants. So Pisistratus was a tyrant. Nowadays\r\nonly a ruler who is cruel and unjust is called a tyrant. Pisistratus,\r\nhowever, settled the difficulties of both sides, and, though a\r\ntyrant in the Greek sense, he was neither cruel nor unjust. In fact,\r\nPisistratus ruled according to the laws of Solon, and he did a great\r\ndeal to improve Athens and the life of the people. Among other things\r\nhe did, he had Homer’s poems written down, so that people could read\r\nthem, for before this time people knew them only from hearing them\r\nrecited. So the people put up with Pisistratus and also with his son\r\nfor a while. But finally the Athenians got tired of the son’s rule and\r\ndrove all the Pisistratus family out of Athens in 510 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe next man to try and settle the quarrels of the two sides was named\r\nClisthenes. It is hard, sometimes, to learn the name of a stranger to\r\nwhom we have just been introduced unless we hear his name repeated\r\nseveral times. So I will say over his name so that you can get used to\r\nhearing it:\r\n\r\n  CLISTHENES;\r\n      CLISTHENES;\r\n          CLISTHENES.\r\n\r\nYour father may be poor or he may be rich.\r\n\r\nIf he is poor he has one vote when there is an election.\r\n\r\nIf he is rich he has one vote but only one vote and no more.\r\n\r\nIf he breaks the laws, whether he is rich or whether he is poor, he\r\nmust go to jail.\r\n\r\nIt was not always so; it is not always so even now. But long ago it was\r\nmuch worse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ostracism.]\r\n\r\nClisthenes gave every one a vote--rich and poor alike--and ruled wisely\r\nand well.\r\n\r\nClisthenes started something called ostracism. If for any reason the\r\npeople wanted to get rid of a man, all they had to do was to scratch\r\nhis name on any piece of a broken pot or jar they might find and drop\r\nit in a voting-box on a certain day. If there were enough such votes,\r\nthe man would have to leave the city and stay away for ten years. This\r\nwas called ostracism, and a man so treated was said to be ostracized,\r\nfrom the Greek name for such a broken piece of pottery, on which the\r\nname was written. Even to-day we use this same word to speak of a\r\nperson whom no one will have anything to do with, whom no one wants\r\naround, saying he has been ostracized.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been sent away from the table to the kitchen or to your\r\nroom for being naughty?\r\n\r\nThen you, too, have been ostracized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nRome Kicks Out Her Kings\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 509 B.C. something happened in Rome.\r\n\r\nThere were two classes of people in Rome, just as there were in Athens;\r\nthe wealthy people who were called patricians and the poor people who\r\nwere called plebeians. We use the same words now and call people who\r\nare rich and aristocratic “patricians,” and the people who are poor and\r\nuneducated “plebeians.” The patricians were allowed to vote, but the\r\nplebeians were not allowed to vote.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the plebeians had been given the right to vote. But\r\nin 509 Rome had a king named Tarquin. He didn’t think the plebeians\r\nshould be allowed to vote, and so he said they should not. The\r\nplebeians would not stand this, and so they got together and drove\r\nTarquin out of the city, as the Athenians had driven out their king.\r\nThis was in 509, and Tarquin was the last king Rome ever had.\r\n\r\nAfter King Tarquin had been driven out, the Romans started what is\r\ncalled a republic, something like our own country, but they were\r\nafraid to have only one man as president for fear he might make himself\r\nking, and they had had enough of kings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lictor carrying fasces.]\r\n\r\nSo the Romans elected _two men_ each year to be rulers over them, and\r\nthese two men they called consuls. Each consul had a body-guard of\r\ntwelve men--just a dozen. These men were given the name “lictors,” and\r\neach lictor carried an ax tied up in a bundle of sticks. This bundle of\r\nsticks with the ax-head sticking out in the middle or at the end was\r\nknown as “fasces” and signified that the consuls had power to punish by\r\nwhipping with the sticks or by chopping off one’s head with the ax.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have seen fasces used as ornaments or as a decoration\r\naround monuments or on buildings like a court-house, city hall, or\r\ncapitol. Why do you suppose they are used in this way?\r\n\r\nOne of the first two consuls was named Brutus the Elder, and he had two\r\nsons. The king, Tarquin, who had been driven out of the city, plotted\r\nto get back to Rome and become king once more. He was able to persuade\r\nsome Romans to help him. Among those whom he persuaded were, strange to\r\nsay, the two sons of Brutus--the new consul of Rome.\r\n\r\nBrutus found out this plot and learned that his own children had helped\r\nTarquin. So Brutus had his sons tried. They were found guilty, and in\r\nspite of the fact that they were his own children, he had the lictors\r\nput both of them to death as well as the other traitors to Rome.\r\n\r\nTarquin did not succeed in getting back the rule of Rome in this way,\r\nand so the next year he tried again. This time he got together an army\r\nof his neighbors, the Etruscans, and with this army he attacked Rome.\r\n\r\nNow, there was a wooden bridge across the Tiber River, which separated\r\nthe Etruscans from the city of Rome. In order to keep the Etruscans\r\nfrom crossing into the city, a Roman named Horatius, who had already\r\nlost one eye in fighting for Rome, gave orders to have this bridge\r\nbroken down.\r\n\r\nWhile the bridge was being chopped down, Horatius with two of his\r\nfriends stood on the far side of the bridge and fought back the whole\r\nEtruscan army. When the bridge was cracking under the blows of the\r\nRoman soldiers, Horatius ordered his two friends to run quickly to the\r\nother side before the bridge fell.\r\n\r\nThen Horatius, all by himself, kept the enemy back until at last the\r\nbridge crashed into the river. Horatius then jumped into the water\r\nwith all his armor on and swam toward the Roman shore. Though arrows\r\nthe Etruscans shot were falling all around him, and though his armor\r\nweighed him down, he reached the other side safely. Even the Etruscans\r\nwere thrilled at his bravery, and, enemies though they were, they\r\ncheered him loudly.\r\n\r\nThere is a very famous poem called “Horatius at the Bridge,” which\r\ndescribes this brave deed, and most boys like to learn at least a part\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nA few years after Horatius, there lived another Roman named\r\nCincinnatus. He was only a simple farmer with a little farm on the bank\r\nof the Tiber, but he was very wise and good, and the people of Rome\r\nhonored and trusted him.\r\n\r\nOne day when an enemy was about to attack the city--for in those days\r\nthere always seemed to be enemies everywhere ready to attack Rome on\r\nany excuse--the people had to have a leader and a general. They thought\r\nof Cincinnatus and went and asked him to be dictator.\r\n\r\nNow, a dictator was the name they gave to a man who in case of sudden\r\ndanger was called upon to command the army and in fact all the people\r\nfor the time being while there was danger. Cincinnatus left his plow,\r\nwent with the people to the city, got together an army, went out and\r\ndefeated the enemy, and returned to Rome, all in twenty-four hours!\r\n\r\nThe people were so much pleased with the quick and decided way in which\r\nCincinnatus had saved Rome that they wanted him to keep right on being\r\ntheir general in time of peace. Even though they hated kings so much,\r\nthey would have made him king if he would have accepted.\r\n\r\nBut Cincinnatus did not want any such thing. His duty done, he wanted\r\nto return to his wife and humble home and his little farm. So in spite\r\nof what many would have thought a wonderful chance, he did go back to\r\nhis plow, choosing to be just a simple farmer instead of being king.\r\n\r\nThe city of Cincinnati in Ohio is named after a society which was\r\nfounded in honor of this old Roman, who lived nearly five hundred years\r\nbefore Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nGreece _vs._ Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know what those two little letters “vs.” mean between Greece and\r\nPersia in the name of this story?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have seen them used on football tickets when there was to\r\nbe a match between two teams, as, for example, Harvard vs. Yale.\r\n\r\nThey stand for “versus,” which means “against.”\r\n\r\nWell, there was to be a great match between Greece and Persia, but\r\nit wasn’t a game; it was a fight for life and death, a fight between\r\nlittle Greece and great big Persia.\r\n\r\nCyrus, the great Persian king, had conquered Babylon and other\r\ncountries, as well, and he had kept on conquering until Persia ruled\r\nmost of the world, all except Greece and Italy.\r\n\r\nAbout the Year 500 B.C. the new ruler of this vast Persian Empire was\r\na man named Darius. Darius looked at the map, as you might do, and saw\r\nthat he owned and ruled over a large part of it. What a pity, thought\r\nhe, that there should be a little country like Greece that did not\r\nbelong to him!\r\n\r\nSo Darius said to himself, “I must have this piece of land called\r\nGreece to complete my empire.” Besides, the Greeks had given him some\r\ntrouble. They had helped some of his subjects to rebel against him.\r\nDarius said, “I must punish these Greeks for what they have done and\r\nthen just add their country to mine.”\r\n\r\nSo he called his son-in-law and told him to go over to Greece and\r\nconquer it.\r\n\r\nHis son-in-law did as he was told and started out with a fleet and an\r\narmy to do the punishing. But before his fleet could reach Greece it\r\nwas destroyed by a storm, and he had to go back home without having\r\ndone anything.\r\n\r\nDarius was very angry at this, mad with his son-in-law and mad with the\r\ngods who he thought had wrecked his ships, and he made up his mind that\r\nhe himself would go and do the punishing and conquering the next time.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, he sent his messengers to all the Greek cities and\r\nordered each of them to send him some earth and some water as a sign\r\nthat they would give him their land and become his subjects peaceably\r\nwithout a fight.\r\n\r\nMany Greek cities were so frightened by the threat of Darius and by his\r\nmighty power that they gave in at once and sent earth and water as\r\nthey were told to do.\r\n\r\nBut little Athens and little Sparta both hotly refused to do so, in\r\nspite of the fact that they were only two small cities against the vast\r\nempire of Darius.\r\n\r\nAthens took Darius’ messenger and threw him into a well, saying, “There\r\nis earth and water for you; help yourself”; and Sparta did likewise.\r\nThen these two cities joined their forces and called on all their\r\nneighbors to join with them to fight for their native land against\r\nDarius and Persia.\r\n\r\nSo Darius made ready to conquer Athens and then Sparta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Trireme.]\r\n\r\nIn order to reach Athens his army had to be carried across the sea in\r\nboats. Of course, in those days there were no steamboats. Steamboats\r\nwere invented thousands of years later. The only way to make a boat go\r\nwas with sails or with oars. To make a large boat move with oars, it\r\nwas necessary to have a great many rowers--three rows one above the\r\nother on each side of the boat.\r\n\r\nSuch a boat was called a trireme, which means three rows of oars. It\r\ntook about 600 of these boats to carry Darius’ army over to Greece.\r\nEach of these 600 boats carried, besides the rowers or crew, about 200\r\nsoldiers. So you can see for yourself how many soldiers Darius had\r\nin this army, if there were 600 ship-loads of them and 200 soldiers\r\non each ship. Yes, that is an example in multiplication--120,000\r\nsoldiers--that’s right.\r\n\r\nSo the Persians sailed across the sea; and this time there was no\r\nstorm, and they reached the shore of Greece safely. They landed on a\r\nspot called the plain of Marathon, which was only about twenty-six\r\nmiles away from Athens. You will see presently why I have told you just\r\nthe number of miles--twenty-six.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenians heard that the Persians were coming, they wanted to\r\nget Sparta in a hurry to help, as she had promised to do.\r\n\r\nNow, there were no telegraphs or telephones or railroads, of course,\r\nin those days. There was no way in which they could send a message to\r\nSparta except to have it carried by hand.\r\n\r\nSo they called on a famous runner named Pheidippides to carry the\r\nmessage. Pheidippides started out and ran the whole way from Athens to\r\nSparta, about one hundred and fifty miles, to carry the message. He ran\r\nnight and day, hardly stopping at all to rest or to eat, and on the\r\nsecond day he was in Sparta.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans, however, sent back word that they couldn’t start just\r\nthen; the moon wasn’t full, and it was bad luck to start when the moon\r\nwasn’t full, as nowadays some superstitious people think it bad luck\r\nto start on a trip on Friday. They said they would come after a while,\r\nwhen the moon was full.\r\n\r\nBut the Athenians couldn’t wait for the moon. They knew the Persians\r\nwould be in Athens before then, and they didn’t want them to get as far\r\nas that.\r\n\r\nSo all the fighting men in Athens left their city and went forth to\r\nmeet the Persians on the plain of Marathon--twenty-six miles away.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were led by a man named Miltiades, and there were only\r\nten thousand soldiers of them. Besides these, there were one thousand\r\nmore from a little near-by town, which was friendly with Athens and\r\nwished to stand by her--eleven thousand in all. If you figure it out,\r\nyou will see that there were perhaps ten times as many Persians as\r\nthere were Greeks, ten Persian soldiers to one Greek soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, however, were trained athletes, as we know, and their whole\r\nmanner of life made them physically fit. The Persians were no match for\r\nthem. And so, in spite of the small number of Greeks, the large number\r\nof Persians were beaten, and beaten badly. Of course the Greeks were\r\nfar better soldiers than the Persians, for all their training made them\r\nso, but more than all this, they were fighting for themselves to save\r\ntheir homes and their families.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard the fable of the hound who was chasing a hare.\r\nThe hare escaped. The hound was made fun of for not catching the little\r\nhare. To which the hound replied, “I was only running for my supper;\r\nthe hare was running for his life.”\r\n\r\nThe Persian soldiers were not fighting for their homes or families,\r\nwhich were away back across the sea; and it made little difference to\r\nthem who won, anyway, for they were merely hirelings on slaves; they\r\nwere fighting for a king because he ordered them to.\r\n\r\nNaturally the Greeks were overjoyed at this victory.\r\n\r\nPheidippides, the famous runner, who was now at Marathon, started off\r\nat once to carry the joyful news back to Athens, twenty-six miles away.\r\nThe whole distance he ran without stopping for breath. But he had not\r\nhad time to rest up from his long run to Sparta, which he had taken\r\nonly a few days before, and so fast did he run this long distance that\r\nas soon as he had reached Athens and gasped the news to the Athenians\r\nin the market-place he dropped down dead!\r\n\r\nIn honor of this famous run, they have nowadays, in the new Olympic\r\nGames, what is called a Marathon race, in which the athletes run this\r\nsame distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The First Marathon Race.”]\r\n\r\nThis battle of Marathon took place in 490 B. C. and is one of the most\r\nfamous battles in all history, for the great Persian army was beaten by\r\none little city and its neighbor, and the Persians had to go back to\r\ntheir homes in disgrace.\r\n\r\nA little handful of people, who governed themselves, had defeated a\r\ngreat king with a large army of only hired soldiers or slaves.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the last the Greeks were to see of the Persians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nFighting Mad\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius was now angrier than ever, and still more determined to whip\r\nthose stubborn Greeks, who dared to defy him and his enormous power;\r\nand he began to get ready for one more attempt. This time, however, he\r\nmade up his mind that he would get together such an army and navy that\r\nthere would be no chance in the world against it, and he made a solemn\r\noath to destroy the Greeks. So for several years he gathered troops and\r\nsupplies, but something happened, and in spite of his oath he did not\r\ncarry out his plan. Why? You guessed it. He died.\r\n\r\nBut Darius had a son named Xerxes--pronounced as if it began with a Z.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, there was an alphabet rime that began, “A is for\r\nApple,” and went on down to, “X is for Xerxes, a great Persian king.”\r\nI learned the rime, though I did not know at that time anything either\r\nabout Xerxes or Persia.\r\n\r\nXerxes was just as determined as his father had been that the Greeks\r\nmust be beaten, so he went on getting ready.\r\n\r\nBut the Greeks also were just as determined that they must _not_ be\r\nbeaten, so they, too, went on getting ready, for they knew the Persians\r\nwould sooner or later come back and try again.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were two chief men in Athens, and each was trying to\r\nbe leader. One was named Themistocles--pronounced The-mis-to-klees--and\r\nthe other Aristides--pronounced Air-is-tie-dees. Notice how many Greek\r\nnames seem to end in “es.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles urged the Athenians to get ready for what he knew was\r\ncoming, the next war with Persia. Especially did he urge the Athenians\r\nto build a fleet of boats, for they had no boats and the Persians had a\r\ngreat many.\r\n\r\nAristides, on the other hand, didn’t believe in Themistocles’ scheme to\r\nbuild boats. He thought it a foolish expense and talked against it.\r\n\r\nAristides had always been so wise and fair that people called him\r\nAristides the Just. Some of the people wanted to get rid of him,\r\nbecause they thought he was wrong and Themistocles was right. So they\r\nwaited till the time came to vote to ostracize any one they wanted to\r\nget rid of. Do you remember who started this custom? Clisthenes--about\r\n500 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhen the day for voting came, a man who could not write and did not\r\nknow Aristides by sight happened to ask his help in voting. Aristides\r\ninquired what name he should write, and the man replied, “Aristides.”\r\n\r\nAristides did not tell who he was, but merely said:\r\n\r\n“Why do you want to get rid of this man? Has he done anything wrong?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” the voter replied. “He hasn’t done anything wrong”; but with\r\na long sigh he said, “I’m so tired of hearing him always called ’The\r\nJust.’”\r\n\r\nAristides must have been surprised by this unreasonable answer, but\r\nnevertheless he wrote his own name for the voter, and when the votes\r\nwere counted there were so many that he was ostracized.\r\n\r\nThough it did not seem quite fair that Aristides should be ostracized,\r\nit was fortunate, as it turned out, that Themistocles had his way, and\r\nit was fortunate the Athenians went on preparing for war.\r\n\r\nThey built a fleet of triremes. Then they got all the cities and towns\r\nin Greece to agree to join forces in case of war. Sparta, on account of\r\nits fame as a city of soldiers, was made the leader of all the others\r\nin case war should come.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just ten years after the battle of Marathon, in 480 B. C.,\r\nthe great Persian army was again ready to attack Greece. It had been,\r\nbrought together from all parts of the vast Persian Empire and was far\r\nbigger than the former army with its 120,000 men, although that was a\r\nlarge army for those days.\r\n\r\nThis time the army is supposed to have consisted of over two million\r\nsoldiers--two million; just think of that! The question then was how\r\nto get so many soldiers over to Greece. Such a multitude could not be\r\ncarried across to Greece in boats, for even the largest triremes only\r\nheld a few hundred men, and it would have taken--well, can you tell how\r\nmany boats, to carry over two million? Probably many more triremes than\r\nthere were in the whole world at that time. So Xerxes decided to have\r\nhis army march to Greece, the long way but the only way round. So they\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a strip of water called a strait, something like a wide\r\nriver, right across the path the Persian army had to take. This strait\r\nwas then called the Hellespont. It is, of course, still there, but if\r\nyou look on the map now you will find it is now called the Dardanelles.\r\nBut there was no bridge across the Hellespont, for it was almost a mile\r\nwide, and they didn’t have bridges as long as that in those days. So\r\nXerxes fastened boats together in a line that stretched from one shore\r\nto the other shore, and over these boats he built a floor to form a\r\nbridge so that his army could cross upon it.\r\n\r\nHardly had he finished building the bridge, however, when a storm arose\r\nand destroyed it. Xerxes, in anger at the waves, ordered that the water\r\nof the Hellespont be whipped as if it were a slave he were punishing.\r\nThen he built another bridge, and this time the water behaved itself,\r\nand his soldiers were able to cross over safely.\r\n\r\nSo vast was Xerxes’ army that it is said to have taken it seven days\r\nand seven nights marching continuously all the time in two long\r\nunbroken lines to get over to the opposite shore. Xerxes’ fleet\r\nfollowed the army as closely as they could along the shore, and at last\r\nthey reached the top of Greece. Down through the north of Greece the\r\narmy came, overrunning everything before it, and it seemed as though\r\nnothing on earth could stop such numbers of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nOne Against a Thousand\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a little narrow passageway with the mountains on one side\r\nand the water on the other through which the Persians had to go to\r\nreach Athens. This pass is called Thermopylæ, and you might guess what\r\nThermopylæ means if you notice that the first part is like Thermos\r\nbottle, which means “hot” bottle. As a matter of fact, Thermopylæ meant\r\nHot Gateway, and was so named because this natural gateway to Greece\r\nhad hot springs near-by.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks decided that it was best to stop the Persians at this\r\ngate--to go to meet them there first before they reached Athens. In\r\nsuch a place a few Greek soldiers could fight better against a much\r\nlarger number.\r\n\r\nIt also seemed wise to send picked Greek troops to meet the Persians,\r\nthe very best soldiers in Greece with the very bravest general to lead\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo the Spartan king, who was named Leonidas--which in Greek means “like\r\na lion”--was chosen to go to Thermopylæ, and with him seven thousand\r\nsoldiers--seven thousand soldiers to block the way of two million\r\nPersians! Three hundred of these were Spartans, and a Spartan was\r\ntaught that he must never surrender, never give up. A Spartan mother\r\nused to say to her son:\r\n\r\n“Come back _with_ your shield or _on_ it.”\r\n\r\nWhen Xerxes found his way blocked by this ridiculously small band of\r\nsoldiers, he sent his messengers ordering them to surrender, to give\r\nthemselves up.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you suppose Leonidas replied?\r\n\r\nIt was what we should expect a Spartan to answer, brief and to the\r\npoint; that is, “Laconic.” He said simply:\r\n\r\n“Come and take us.”\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing left for Xerxes to do but fight, he started his\r\narmy forward.\r\n\r\nFor two days the Persians fought the Greeks, but Leonidas still held\r\nthe pass, and the Persians were unable to get through.\r\n\r\nThen a Greek traitor and coward, who thought he might save his own life\r\nand be given a rich prize by Xerxes, told that king of a secret path\r\nover the mountains by which he and his army might slip through and get\r\naround Leonidas and his soldiers who blocked the way.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Leonidas learned that the Persians had found out this\r\npath and were already on the way to pen him in from behind. There was\r\nstill a chance, however, for his men to escape, and Leonidas told all\r\nthose who wanted to do so to leave. Those that remained knew that the\r\nfight was absolutely hopeless and that it meant certain death for all\r\nthem. In spite of this, however, one thousand men, including all the\r\nthree hundred Spartans stood by their leader, for, said they:\r\n\r\n“We have been ordered to hold the pass, and a Spartan obeys orders, and\r\nnever surrenders, no matter what happens.”\r\n\r\nSo there Leonidas and his thousand men fought to the bitter end until\r\nall except one of their number was killed.\r\n\r\nThe gateway to the city of Athens was now open, and things looked very\r\nblack for the Greeks, for there was nothing to prevent the Persians\r\nfrom marching over the dead bodies of Leonidas and his men straight on\r\nto Athens.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, wondering what was to happen to them, hurriedly went to\r\nthe oracle at Delphi and asked what they should do.\r\n\r\nThe oracle replied that the city of Athens itself was doomed, that it\r\nwould be destroyed, there was no hope for it, but that the Athenians\r\nthemselves would be saved by wooden walls.\r\n\r\nThis answer, as was usually the case in whatever the oracle said, was\r\na riddle, the meaning of which seemed hard to solve. Themistocles,\r\nhowever, said that he knew the answer. You remember that it was he who\r\nhad been working so hard to have a fleet of ships built. Themistocles\r\nsaid that the oracle meant these ships when it spoke of the wooden\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nSo the Athenians, following the supposed advice of the oracle, left\r\ntheir city as Themistocles told them and went on board the ships, which\r\nwere not far away, in a bay called Salamis.\r\n\r\nThe Persian army reached Athens and found it deserted. So they burned\r\nand destroyed the city as the oracle said. Then they marched on to the\r\nBay of Salamis, where the Athenians were on board the ships. There, on\r\na hill overlooking the bay, Xerxes had a throne built for himself so\r\nthat he could sit, as if in a box at the theater looking at a play, and\r\nwatch his own large fleet destroy the much smaller one of the Greeks\r\nwith all the Athenians on board.\r\n\r\nThe Greek fleet was commanded, of course, by Themistocles. His ships\r\nwere in this narrow bay or strait of water, somewhat in the same\r\nway that the soldiers of Leonidas had been in the narrow valley at\r\nThermopylæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Xerxes on his throne watching battle of Salamis.]\r\n\r\nThemistocles, seeing that the Bay of Salamis looked somewhat like the\r\nPass of Thermopylæ, had an idea. He made believe he was a traitor like\r\nthe traitor at Thermopylæ and sent word to Xerxes that if the Persian\r\nfleet divided and one half stayed at one end of the strait and the\r\nother half closed off the other end of the strait, the Greeks would be\r\npenned in between and caught as in a trap.\r\n\r\nXerxes thought this a good idea, so he gave orders to have his ships\r\ndo as Themistocles had suggested. But Xerxes, sitting smiling on his\r\nthrone, had the surprise of his life. The result was just the opposite\r\nof what he had expected. With the Persian fleet separated in two parts,\r\nthe Greeks in between could fight both halves of the divided fleet at\r\nthe same time, and the space was so narrow that the Persians’ ships got\r\nin the way of each other and rammed and sank their own boats.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Persian fleet was completely beaten, and the proud and\r\nboastful Xerxes, with most of his army and all the navy that was left,\r\nmade a hasty retreat back to Persia the way they had come.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the last time the Persians ever tried to conquer little\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nIf Themistocles had not had his way and built such a strong fleet, what\r\ndo you think would have become of Athens and Greece!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nThe Golden Age\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were talking about the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, I told you\r\nthat later we should also hear of a Golden Age.\r\n\r\nWell, we have come to the Golden Age now. This doesn’t mean that people\r\nat this time used things made of gold, nor that they had a great deal\r\nof gold money. It means--well, let us see what sort of a time it was,\r\nand then you can tell what it means.\r\n\r\nAfter the wars with Persia, Athens seemed to have been cheered up by\r\nher victory to do wonderful things, and the next fifty years after the\r\nPersians were driven out of Greece--that is, 480 to 430 B. C.--were\r\nthe most wonderful years in the history of Greece and perhaps the most\r\nwonderful years in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nAthens had been burned down by Xerxes. At the time it happened this\r\nseemed like a terrible misfortune. But it wasn’t. The people set to\r\nwork and built a much finer and much more beautiful city than the old\r\none had been.\r\n\r\nNow, the chief person in Athens at this time was a man named Pericles.\r\nHe was not a king nor a ruler, but he was so very wise and such a\r\nwonderful speaker and such a popular leader that he was able to make\r\nthe Athenians do as he thought best. He was like the popular captain of\r\na football team, who is a fine player himself and can make fine players\r\nof all the others on his team. Athens was his team, and he trained\r\nit so well that any one of the team would have been able to fill any\r\nposition no matter how important it was. Some men became great artists.\r\nSome men became great writers. Some men became great philosophers. Do\r\nyou know what philosophers are? They are wise men who know a great deal\r\nand love knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe artists built many beautiful buildings, theaters, and temples. They\r\nmade wonderful statues of the Greek gods and goddesses and placed them\r\non the buildings and about the city.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers taught the people how to be wise and good.\r\n\r\nThe writers composed fine poems and plays. The plays were not like\r\nthose we have nowadays but were all about the doings of the gods and\r\ngoddesses.\r\n\r\nThe theaters were not like those we have nowadays, either. They were\r\nalways out of doors, usually on the side of a hill, where a “grand\r\nstand” could be built facing the stage. There was little or no scenery,\r\nand instead of an orchestra of musicians there was a chorus of singers\r\nto accompany the actors. The actors wore false faces or masks to show\r\nwhat their feelings were, a “comic” mask with a grinning face when they\r\nwanted to be funny and a “tragic” mask with a sorrowful face when they\r\nwanted to seem sad.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have seen pictures of these masks, for in the decorations\r\nof our own theaters these same comic and tragic masks are sometimes\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tragic and comic masks.]\r\n\r\nAthens had been named after the goddess Athene, who was supposed to\r\nwatch out for and look after the city. So the Athenians thought she\r\nshould have a special temple. Accordingly, they built one to her on\r\nthe top of a hill called the Acropolis. This temple they called in her\r\nhonor the Parthenon, meaning the “maiden,” one of the names by which\r\nshe was known.\r\n\r\nThe Parthenon is considered the most beautiful building in the world,\r\nthough as you see by the picture, as it is to-day, it is now in ruins.\r\nIn the center of this temple was a huge statue of Athene made of gold\r\nand ivory by a sculptor named Phidias. We are told that it was the most\r\nbeautiful statue in the world as the Parthenon was the most beautiful\r\nbuilding, but it has completely disappeared, and no one knows what\r\nbecame of it. One might guess, however, that the gold and ivory tempted\r\nthieves, who may have stolen it piece by piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Parthenon.]\r\n\r\nPhidias made many other statues on the outside of the Parthenon, but\r\nmost of these have been carried away and put in museums or have been\r\nlost or destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis statue of Athene and the other sculptures on the Parthenon made\r\nPhidias so famous that he was asked to make a statue of Jupiter to be\r\nplaced at Olympia, where the Olympic Games were held. The statue of\r\nJupiter was finer even than the one he had made of Athene and was so\r\nsplendid that it was called one of the Seven Wonders of the World. You\r\nremember the pyramids of Egypt and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were\r\ntwo others of the Seven Wonders.\r\n\r\nPhidias is probably the greatest sculptor that ever lived, but he did\r\na thing which the Greeks considered a crime and would not forgive. We\r\ndo not see anything so terribly wrong in what he did, but the Greeks’\r\nidea of right and wrong was different from ours. This is what he did.\r\nOn the shield of the statue of Athene that he had made, Phidias carved\r\na picture of himself and also one of his friend Pericles. It was merely\r\na part of the decoration of the shield, and hardly any one would have\r\nnoticed it. But according to the Greek notion it was sacrilege to\r\nmake a picture of a human being on a statue of a goddess. So when the\r\nAthenians found out what Phidias had done they threw him into prison,\r\nand there he died.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks used different kinds of columns on their buildings, and\r\nthese columns are used in many public and in some private buildings\r\nto-day. I’ll tell you what each kind is like; then see how many you can\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nThe Parthenon was built in a style called Doric.\r\n\r\nThe top of the column is called the capital, and the capital of the\r\nDoric column is shaped like a saucer with a square cover on top\r\nof it. There was no base or block at the bottom of the column. It\r\nrested directly on the floor. As the Doric column is so plain and\r\nstrong-looking it is called the man’s style.\r\n\r\nThe second style is called _Ionic_.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Ionic column has a base, and the capital has\r\nornaments like curls underneath the square top, and the column has a\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nAs this column is more slender and more ornamental than the Doric, it\r\nis called the woman’s style.\r\n\r\nThe third style is called _Corinthian_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Doric. 2. Ionic. 3. Corinthian.]\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Corinthian column is higher than either of the other\r\ntwo and still more ornamental. It is said that the architect who first\r\nmade this column got his idea for its capital from seeing a basketful\r\nof toys that had been placed on a child’s grave as was the custom\r\ninstead of flowers. The basket had been covered with a slab, and leaves\r\nof the thistle called the acanthus had grown up around the basket. It\r\nlooked so pretty that the architect thought it would make a beautiful\r\ncapital for a column, and so he copied it.\r\n\r\nI asked some boys which one could find the most columns. The next\r\nday one boy said he had seen two Ionic columns, one on each side of\r\nthe door of his house. The second had seen ten Doric columns on the\r\nsavings-bank. But the third said he had seen 138 Corinthian columns.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth did you see so many?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I counted the lamp-posts from my house to the school,” he said. “They\r\nwere kind of Corinthian columns.”\r\n\r\nOne of the friends of Pericles was a man named Herodotus. He wrote in\r\nGreek the first history of the world. For this reason Herodotus is\r\ncalled the Father of History, and some day if you study Greek you may\r\nread what he wrote in his own language. Of course, at that time there\r\nwas very little history to write. What has happened since _hadn’t_\r\nhappened then, and before his time little was known of what had taken\r\nplace. So Herodotus’s history was chiefly a story of the wars with\r\nPersia, which I have just told you about. After that he had to stop;\r\nthere was nothing more to write about.\r\n\r\nIn those days every once in a while a terrible contagious disease,\r\ncalled a plague, would break out, and people would be taken sick and\r\ndie by the thousands, for the doctors knew very little about the plague\r\nor how to cure it. Such a plague came upon Athens, and the Athenians\r\ndied like poisoned flies. Pericles himself nursed the sick and did all\r\nhe could for them, but finally he, too, was taken sick with the plague\r\nand died. So ended the Golden Age, which has been called in honor of\r\nits greatest man the Age of Pericles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nWhen Greek Meets Greek\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Golden Age, when Athens was so wonderful, lasted for only fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhy, do you suppose, did it stop at all?\r\n\r\nIt stopped chiefly because of a fight.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, the fight was not between Greece and some one\r\noutside, as in the Persian Wars. The fight was between two cities\r\nthat had before this been more or less friendly--mostly less--between\r\nSparta and Athens. It was a family quarrel between Greeks. And the\r\nfight was all because one of these cities--Sparta--was jealous of the\r\nother--Athens.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans, as you know, were fine soldiers. The Athenians were fine\r\nsoldiers, too. But ever since Themistocles with the ships he had built\r\nhad beaten the Persians at Salamis, Athens had also a fine fleet, and\r\nSparta had no fleet. Furthermore, Athens had become the most beautiful\r\nand most cultured city in the whole world.\r\n\r\nSparta did not care much about Athens’s beautiful buildings and her\r\neducation and culture and that sort of thing; that did not interest\r\nher. What did make her jealous was Athens’s fleet. Sparta was inland,\r\nnot on nor near the sea-shore as Athens was; so she could not have a\r\nfleet at all. Sparta did not intend, however, to let Athens get ahead\r\nof her, and so on one excuse or another Sparta with all of _her_\r\nneighbors started a war against Athens with all of _her_ neighbors.\r\n\r\nSparta was in a part of Greece which was called by the hard name, the\r\nPeloponnesus. But in those days the boys did not think this a hard\r\nname, for they were as familiar with it as you are with such a name as\r\nMassachusetts, for instance, which would seem just as hard to a Greek\r\nas Peloponnesus does to you. This war between Athens and Sparta was\r\ntherefore called the Peloponnesian War from the fact that it was not\r\nonly Sparta but all of the Peloponnesus that fought against Athens.\r\n\r\nWe think a war lasts entirely too long if it lasts four or five years,\r\nbut the Peloponnesian War lasted twenty-seven years! There is a saying,\r\n“When Greek meets Greek then comes a tug of war!” which means to say,\r\n“When two equal fighters such as Athens and Sparta, both Greek, meet\r\neach other in battle, who knows how it will end?”\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell you about all the battles that took place\r\nduring these twenty-seven years, but at the end of this long and bloody\r\nwar both cities were tired and worn out, and the glory of Athens was\r\ngone. Although Sparta was ahead, neither city ever amounted to much\r\nafterward. The Peloponnesian War ruined them both. That’s the way war\r\ndoes!\r\n\r\nAll during the Peloponnesian War there was a man at Athens by the\r\nname of Socrates who, many think, was one of the wisest and best men\r\nwho ever lived. He was called a philosopher and went about the city\r\nteaching the people what was right and what they ought to do. But\r\ninstead of actually _telling_ the people what he thought was right, he\r\nasked them questions which made them see what was right. In this way,\r\nchiefly by asking questions, he led people to find out for themselves\r\nwhat he wanted them to know. This kind of teaching, simply by asking\r\nquestions, has ever since been called Socratic.\r\n\r\nSocrates had a snub nose and was bald and quite ugly, and yet he was\r\nvery popular with the Athenians, which may seem strange, for the\r\nAthenians loved beautiful faces and beautiful figures and beautiful\r\nthings, and Socrates was anything but beautiful. It must have been the\r\nbeauty of Socrates’s character that made them forget his ugliness,\r\nas I know some boys and girls who think their teacher is perfectly\r\nbeautiful just because she is so good and kind that they love her,\r\nalthough she is really not pretty at all.\r\n\r\nSocrates had a wife named Xantippe. She had a bad temper and was the\r\nworst kind of a crosspatch. She thought Socrates was wasting his time,\r\nthat he was a loafer, as he did no work that brought in any money. One\r\nday she scolded him so loudly that he left the house, whereupon she\r\nthrew a bucket of water on him. Socrates, who never answered back,\r\nmerely remarked to himself:\r\n\r\n“After thunder, rain may be expected.”\r\n\r\nSocrates didn’t believe in all the Greek gods, Jupiter, Venus, and the\r\nrest, but he was careful not to say so himself, for the Greeks were\r\nvery particular that no one should say or do anything against their\r\ngods. Phidias, you remember, was thrown into prison for merely putting\r\nhis picture on the shield of the goddess Athene, and one would have\r\nbeen put to death for teaching young men not to believe in the gods.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Socrates, as he had feared he would be, was charged\r\nwith not believing in the Greek gods and with teaching others not to\r\nbelieve in them. And so for this he was condemned to death. He was not\r\nhanged or put to death as prisoners are now, however. He was ordered to\r\ndrink a cup of hemlock, which was a deadly poison. Socrates’s pupils,\r\nor disciples, as they were then called, tried to have him refuse to\r\ndrink the cup, but he would not disobey the order; and so, when he was\r\nnearly seventy years old, he drank the cup of hemlock and died with all\r\nhis disciples around him.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was four hundred years before Christ was born, and\r\nbefore, therefore, there were any such things as Christians or a\r\nChristian religion, yet Socrates believed and taught two things that\r\nare just what Christians also believe.\r\n\r\nOne of these things he believed was that each of us has inside a\r\nconscience, which tells us what is right and what is wrong; we don’t\r\nhave to read from a book or be told by another what is right or what is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAnother thing he taught was that there is a life after death and that\r\nwhen we die our souls live on.\r\n\r\nNo wonder he was not afraid himself to die!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nWise Men and Otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever been playing in your yard when a strange boy who had been\r\nwatching from the other side of the fence asked to be let into the\r\ngame, saying he would show you how to play? You didn’t want him around,\r\nand you didn’t want him in, but somehow or other he got in and was soon\r\nbossing everybody else.\r\n\r\nWell, there was a man named Philip who lived north of Greece, and he\r\nhad been watching Sparta and Athens--not playing but fighting--and he\r\nwanted “to get into the game.” Philip was king of a little country\r\ncalled Macedonia, but he thought he would like to be king of Greece,\r\nalso, and it seemed to him a good time, when Sparta and Athens were\r\n“down and out” after the Peloponnesian War, to step in and make himself\r\nking of that country. Philip was a great fighter, but he didn’t want to\r\nfight Greece unless he had to. He wanted to be made king peaceably, and\r\nhe wanted Greece to do it willingly. So he thought up a scheme to bring\r\nthis about, and this was his scheme.\r\n\r\nHe knew, as you do, how the Greeks hated the Persians whom they had\r\ndriven out of their country over a hundred years before. Although\r\nthe Persian Wars had taken place so long ago, the Greeks had never\r\nforgotten the bravery of their forefathers and the tales of their\r\nvictories over the Persians. These stories had been told them over and\r\nover by their fathers and grandfathers, and they loved to read and\r\nreread them in Herodotus’s history of the world.\r\n\r\nSo Philip said to the Greeks:\r\n\r\n“Your ancestors drove the Persians out of Greece, to be sure, but the\r\nPersians went back to their country, and you didn’t go after them and\r\npunish them as you should have done. You didn’t try ’to get even’ with\r\nthem. Why don’t you go over to Persia and conquer it now, and make the\r\nPersians pay for what they did to you?” Then he slyly added:\r\n\r\n“Let me help you. I’ll lead you against them.”\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to see through Philip’s scheme--nobody except one man.\r\nThis man was an Athenian named Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes, when he was a boy, had decided that he would some day be\r\na great speaker or orator, just as you might say you are going to be a\r\ndoctor, or an aviator, or a lawyer when you grow up.\r\n\r\nBut Demosthenes had picked the one profession which by nature he was\r\nworst fitted for. In the first place, he had such a very soft, weak\r\nvoice that one could hardly hear him. Besides this, he st-st-stammered\r\nvery b-b-badly and could not re-cite even a sh-sh-short p-p-poem\r\nwithout hesit-t-tating and st-st-stumbling so that people laughed at\r\nhim. It seemed absurd, therefore, that he should aim to be a great\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nBut Demosthenes practised and _practised_ and _practised_ by himself.\r\nHe went down on the sea-shore and put pebbles in his mouth to make it\r\nmore difficult to speak clearly. Then he spoke to the roaring waves,\r\nmaking believe that he was addressing an angry crowd, who were trying\r\nto drown the sound of his voice, so that he would have to speak very\r\nloud indeed.\r\n\r\nSo at last, by keeping constantly at it, Demosthenes did become the\r\ngreatest speaker that ever lived. He spoke so wonderfully that he could\r\nmake his audience laugh or make them cry whenever he wanted to, and he\r\ncould persuade them to do almost anything he wished.\r\n\r\nNow, Demosthenes was the man who saw through Philip’s scheme for\r\nconquering Persia. He knew that Philip’s real aim was to become king\r\nof Greece. So he made twelve speeches against him. These speeches were\r\nknown as Philippics, as they were against Philip. So famous were they\r\nthat even to-day we call a speech that bitterly attacks any one a\r\nPhilippic.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks who heard Demosthenes were red-hot against Philip while\r\nthey listened to him. But as soon as they got away from the sound of\r\nDemosthenes’s words the same Greeks became lukewarm and did nothing to\r\nstop Philip.\r\n\r\nSo at last, in spite of everything that Demosthenes had said, Philip\r\nhad his way and became king over all Greece.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, he could start out, as he had promised, to conquer\r\nPersia, he was killed by one of his own men, so that he was unable to\r\ncarry out his plan.\r\n\r\nBut Philip had a son named Alexander. Alexander was only twenty years\r\nold, not old enough even to vote if he had lived in our country, but\r\nwhen his father died he became king of Macedonia and also of Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was a mere child, he saw some men trying without success\r\nto tame a young and very wild horse that shied and reared in the air so\r\nthat no one was able to ride it. Alexander asked to be allowed to try\r\nto ride the animal. Alexander’s father made fun of his son for wanting\r\nto attempt what those older than he had been unable to do, but at last\r\ngave his consent.\r\n\r\nNow, Alexander had noticed what the others, although much older, had\r\nnot noticed. The horse seemed to be afraid of its own shadow, for young\r\ncolts are easily frightened by anything black and moving, as some\r\nchildren are afraid of the dark.\r\n\r\nSo Alexander turned the horse around facing the sun, so that its shadow\r\nwould be behind, out of sight. He then mounted the animal and, to the\r\namazement of all, rode off without any further trouble.\r\n\r\nHis father was delighted at his son’s cleverness and gave him the horse\r\nas a reward. Alexander named the horse Bucephalus and became so fond\r\nof him that when the horse died Alexander built a monument to him and\r\nnamed several cities after him.\r\n\r\nNow, Alexander was a wonderful boy, but he had such a wonderful teacher\r\nnamed Aristotle that some people think part, at least, of his greatness\r\nwas due to the teacher.\r\n\r\nAristotle was probably the greatest teacher that ever lived. If there\r\nwere more great teachers like Aristotle, it seems likely there would\r\nhave been more great pupils like Alexander.\r\n\r\nAristotle wrote books about all sorts of things--books about the stars\r\ncalled astronomy, books about animals called zoölogy, and books on\r\nother subjects that you probably have never even heard of, such as\r\npsychology and politics.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years these books that Aristotle wrote were the\r\nschool-books that boys and girls studied, and for a thousand years\r\nthey were the _only_ school-books. Nowadays, a school-book is usually\r\nold-fashioned a few years after it is written and is then no longer\r\nused. So you see how remarkable it was that Aristotle’s school-books\r\nshould have been used for so long a time.\r\n\r\nAristotle had been taught by a man named Plato, who was also a great\r\nteacher and philosopher. Plato had been a pupil of Socrates, so that\r\nAristotle was a kind of “grand-pupil” of Socrates. You have heard of\r\nthe Wise Men of the East. These were the three Wise Men of Greece.\r\n\r\n  SOCRATES,\r\n    PLATO,\r\n      ARISTOTLE.\r\n\r\nSome day you may read what they wrote or said over two thousand years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nA Boy King\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are twenty years old, what do you think you will be doing?\r\n\r\nWill you be playing football on your college team?\r\n\r\nWill you be working in a bank, or what?\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was twenty he was king of both Macedonia and Greece. But\r\nMacedonia and Greece were entirely too small for this wonderful young\r\nman. He wanted to own a much bigger country; in fact, he thought he\r\nwould like to own the whole world; that was all--nothing more.\r\n\r\nSo Alexander went right ahead with his father’s plan to conquer Persia.\r\nThe time had come to pay back Persia for that last invasion one hundred\r\nand fifty years before.\r\n\r\nHe got together an army and crossed the Hellespont into Asia and won\r\nbattle after battle against the first Persian armies sent out to stop\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe kept moving on, for Persia was a vast empire.\r\n\r\nSoon he came to a town where in a temple there was kept a rope tied\r\ninto a very far-famed and puzzling knot. It was called the Gordian\r\nKnot, and it was very famous because the oracle had said that whoever\r\nshould undo this knot would conquer Persia. But no one had ever been\r\nable to untie it.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander heard the story, he went to the temple and took a look\r\nat the knot. He saw at once that it would be impossible to untie it,\r\nso, instead of even trying, as others had done, he drew his sword and\r\nwith one stroke cut the knot in two.\r\n\r\nSo now when a person settles something difficult, not by fussing with\r\nit as one untangles a snarl, but at a single stroke, cutting through\r\nall difficulties, we say he “cuts the Gordian Knot.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time on, Alexander conquered one city after another and never\r\nlost any battle of importance until he had conquered the whole of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThen he went into Egypt, which belonged to Persia, and conquered that\r\ncountry, too. To celebrate this victory, he founded a town near the\r\nmouth of the Nile and named it after himself, Alexandria. Then he\r\nstarted there a great library which later grew to be so big that there\r\nwere said to be five hundred thousand books in it--that is, half a\r\nmillion--and was the largest library of ancient times. The books were\r\nnot like those in the library of Assur-bani-pal nor the kind we have\r\nnow, of course, because printing had not been invented. They were every\r\none of them written by hand, and not on pages, but on long sheets which\r\nwere rolled up on sticks to form a scroll.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A scroll, pens and ink.]\r\n\r\nIn the harbor of Alexandria was a little island called Pharos, and on\r\nthis island some years later was built a remarkable lighthouse named\r\nfrom the island, the Pharos, and its light could be seen for many\r\nmiles. It was really a building more like a modern sky-scraper with a\r\ntower. It was over thirty stories high, which seemed most remarkable at\r\nthat time when most buildings were only one or two stories high, and\r\nits light could be seen for many miles. So the Pharos of Alexandria was\r\ncalled one of the Seven Wonders of the World. You have already heard of\r\nthree others, so this makes the fourth.\r\n\r\nAlexandria grew in the course of time to be the largest and most\r\nimportant seaport of the ancient world. Now, however, the Pharos and\r\nthe library and all the old buildings have long since disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander did not stay very long in any one place. He was\r\nrestless. He wanted to keep on the move. He wanted to see new places\r\nand to conquer new people. He almost forgot his own little country of\r\nMacedonia and Greece. Instead of being homesick, however, as most any\r\none would have been, he kept going farther and farther away from home\r\nall the time. We should call such a man an adventurer or an explorer,\r\nas well as a great general. And so he kept on conquering and didn’t\r\nstop conquering until he had reached far-off India.\r\n\r\nThere in India his army, which had stayed on with him all the way,\r\nbecame homesick and wanted to go back. They had been away from home\r\nfor more than ten years and were so far off that they were afraid they\r\nwould never get back.\r\n\r\nAlexander was now only thirty years old, but he was called Alexander\r\nthe Great, for he was ruler of the whole world--at least, all of it\r\nthat was then known and inhabited by civilized people, except Italy,\r\nwhich was still only a collection of little, unimportant towns at that\r\ntime. When Alexander found there were no more countries left for him to\r\nconquer, he was so disappointed that he wept!\r\n\r\nAnd so at last, when there was nothing more to conquer, he agreed to do\r\nwhat his army begged him and started slowly back toward Greece.\r\n\r\nHe got as far as Babylon, the city once so large and so magnificent.\r\nThere he celebrated with a feast, but while feasting and drinking he\r\nsuddenly died. So he never reached Greece.\r\n\r\nThis was in 323 B.C. when he was but 33 years old. You can remember\r\nthese figures easily, for they are all 3’s except the middle figure in\r\nthe date, which is one less than 3.\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great had conquered the largest country that has ever\r\nbeen under the rule of one man, and yet this was not the only reason we\r\ncall him the “Great.”\r\n\r\nHe was not only a great ruler and a great general, but--this may\r\nsurprise you--he was also a great teacher. Aristotle had taught him to\r\nbe that.\r\n\r\nAlexander taught the Greek language to the people whom he conquered\r\nso that they could read Greek books. He taught them about Greek\r\nsculpture and painting. He taught them the wise sayings of the Greek\r\nphilosophers, Socrates and Plato and his own teacher, Aristotle. He\r\ntrained the people in athletics as the Greeks did for their Olympic\r\nGames. And so we can say that he taught far more people than any other\r\nteacher who has ever lived.\r\n\r\nAlexander had married a beautiful Persian girl named Roxana, but their\r\nonly child was a baby, not born until after his father’s death; so when\r\nthe great king died there was no one to rule after him. He had told his\r\ngenerals before he died that the strongest one of them should be the\r\nnext ruler; to fight it out among themselves, as we sometimes say, “May\r\nthe best man win.”\r\n\r\nSo his generals did fight to see who should win, and finally four of\r\nthem, who were victorious, decided to divide up this great empire and\r\neach have a share.\r\n\r\nOne of his generals was named Ptolemy I, and he took Egypt as his\r\nshare and ruled well; but the others did not amount to much, and\r\nafter a while their shares became unimportant and went to pieces.\r\nLike a red toy balloon which stretches and stretches as you blow\r\nit up, Alexander’s empire grew bigger and bigger until--all of a\r\nsudden--“_pop_”--nothing was left but the pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nPicking a Fight\r\n\r\n\r\n“Every dog has his day.”\r\n\r\nA tennis or golf champion wins over the one who was champion before him\r\nand then has a few years during which he is unbeaten. Sooner or later,\r\nhowever, some younger and better man beats him and in turn takes the\r\nchampionship.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost the same way with countries as with people. One country\r\nwins the championship from another, holds it for a few years, and then,\r\nwhen older, finally loses it to some new-comer.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that\r\n\r\n  _Nineveh_ was champion for a while; then\r\n    _Babylon_ had her turn; then\r\n      _Persia_, had her turn; then\r\n        _Greece_; and, lastly,\r\n          _Macedonia_.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder who was to be the next champion after Alexander’s empire\r\nwent to pieces--who was to have the next turn.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was conquering the world he went east toward the rising\r\nsun, and south. He paid little attention to the country to the west\r\ntoward the setting sun. Rome, which we have not heard of for some time,\r\nwas then only a small town with narrow streets and frame houses. It\r\nwas not nearly important enough for Alexander to think much about.\r\nRome herself was not thinking of anything then except keeping the\r\nneighboring towns from beating her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Mediterranean showing Carthage, Spain, etc.]\r\n\r\nIt is usual to speak of a city as “her” or “she” as if a city were a\r\ngirl, but Rome was more like a small boy whom all the other boys were\r\n“picking” on. In the course of time, however, Rome began to grow up and\r\nwas not only able to take care of herself but could put up a very stiff\r\nfight. She was then no longer satisfied with just defending herself. So\r\nshe fought and won battles with most of the other towns in Italy, until\r\nat last she found herself champion of the whole of the “boot.” Then she\r\nbegan to look around to see what other countries there were outside of\r\nItaly that she might conquer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have noticed that Italy, the “boot,” seems about to kick a\r\nlittle island as if it were a football. This island is Sicily, and just\r\nopposite Sicily was a city called Carthage.\r\n\r\nCarthage had been founded by the Phenicians many years before and had\r\nbecome a very rich and powerful city. As she was by the sea, she had\r\nbuilt many ships and traded with all the other seaports along the\r\nMediterranean, just as the old Phenician cities of Tyre and Sidon had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nCarthage did not like to see Rome getting so strong and growing so big\r\nand becoming so powerful. In other words, Carthage was jealous of Rome.\r\n\r\nRome, on her side, was jealous of the wealth and trade of Carthage. So\r\nRome anxiously looked around for some excuse to get into a fight with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNow, you know how easy it is to pick a quarrel and start a fight when\r\nyou are “looking for trouble.” One boy sticks out his tongue, the other\r\ngives him a kick, and the fight is on.\r\n\r\nWell, two countries are at times just like little boys; they start a\r\nfight with just as little excuse, and though they call the fight “war”\r\nit is nothing but a “scrap.” Only there are no fathers to come along\r\nand give them both a spanking and send them to bed without any supper.\r\n\r\nSo it didn’t take long for Rome and Carthage to find an excuse, and a\r\nwar was started between them. The Romans called this fight a Punic War,\r\nfor “Punic” was their name for Phenician, and the Carthaginians were\r\nPhenicians.\r\n\r\nAs Carthage was across the water, the Romans could not get to her\r\nexcept in boats. But Rome had no boats. She was not on the sea-shore,\r\nand she knew nothing about making boats, nor about sailing them, if she\r\nhad had them.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians, on the other hand, had many, many boats, and, like\r\nall the Phenicians, were old and experienced sailors.\r\n\r\nBut Rome happened to find the wreck of a Carthaginian ship that had\r\nbeen cast ashore, and she at once set to work to make a copy of it.\r\nIn a remarkably short time she had built one ship, then another and\r\nanother, until she had a great many ships. Then, though she was new at\r\nthe game, she attacked the Carthaginian fleet.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the Carthaginians could easily have won, for the\r\nRomans knew so little about boats. But in sea battles, before this,\r\nthe fighting had been done by running into the enemy and ramming and\r\nsinking their ships.\r\n\r\nThe Romans knew they were no match for the Carthaginians in this sort\r\nof fighting. So they thought up a way in which they could fight them as\r\non land.\r\n\r\nTo do this they invented a kind of big hook which they called a “crow.”\r\nThe idea was for a ship to run close alongside a Carthaginian ship and,\r\ninstead of trying to sink her, to throw out this big hook or “crow,”\r\ncatch hold of the other ship, and pull both boats dose together. The\r\nRoman soldiers would then scramble over the sides into the enemy’s boat\r\nand fight them the same way they would on land.\r\n\r\nThe scheme worked.\r\n\r\nThis new kind of fighting took the Carthaginians by surprise, and they\r\nwere no match for the Romans at first.\r\n\r\nBut Rome did not have things all her own way by any means. The\r\nCarthaginians soon learned how to fight in this fashion, too. So Rome\r\nlost, as well as won, battles both on land and on sea. But at last she\r\ndid win, and the Carthaginians were beaten. Thus ended the first Punic\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nThe Boot Kicks and Stamps\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Carthaginians were not beaten for good. They were only waiting\r\nfor another chance to get even. As, however, they had been unsuccessful\r\nin attacking Italy from in front as they had been doing, they made up\r\ntheir minds to attack her from the back. Their scheme was to go the\r\nlong way round through Spain and down into Italy from the north.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, they had first of all to conquer Spain so that\r\nthey could get through. They did this, however, rather easily, for the\r\nCarthaginians had a very great general named Hannibal. But then came\r\nthe great difficulty, to get into Italy by this back way.\r\n\r\nAcross the top of the “boot,” at the north of Italy, there are the\r\ngreat mountains called the Alps. They are miles high and covered even\r\nin summer with ice and snow. There are crags and steep cliffs along\r\nwhich any one passing who made a single misstep would be dashed to\r\ndeath thousands of feet below.\r\n\r\nIt was the Alps, therefore, that formed a bigger and better wall than\r\nany city or country could possibly build. Of course the Romans thought\r\nit impossible for any army to climb over such a terribly high and\r\ndangerous wall.\r\n\r\nTime and again there have been things that people call impossible to\r\ndo, and then some one has come along and done them.\r\n\r\nPeople said it was impossible to fly.\r\n\r\nThen some one did it.\r\n\r\nPeople said it was impossible to cross the Alps with an army.\r\n\r\nThen Hannibal came along, and before the Romans knew what had happened\r\nhe had done it. He had crossed the Alps with his army and was in at the\r\nback door!\r\n\r\nThe Romans were unable to keep him from marching on toward their city,\r\nwinning battle after battle as he came along. They were unable to\r\nprevent him marching up and down Italy, conquering other towns in Italy\r\nand doing pretty much as he pleased. It seemed as if Rome were beaten\r\nand she were to lose all of Italy.\r\n\r\nNow, in some games, if you can’t defend your own goal, it may be a good\r\nplan to try attacking your opponent’s goal.\r\n\r\nRome thought she would try this plan. While Hannibal was attacking her,\r\nshe herself would attack Carthage while its general was away and there\r\nwas no strong goal-keeper to defend that city.\r\n\r\nSo the Romans sent a young man named Scipio with an army to do this.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, Scipio went to Spain to cut Hannibal off from the way\r\nhe had come, and this country Scipio reconquered.\r\n\r\nThen he went over to Africa to attack Carthage itself.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians, frightened at being attacked with their general and\r\nhis army far off in Italy, sent as fast as they could for Hannibal to\r\ncome home. When at last he arrived, it was too late. Scipio fought a\r\nfamous battle at Zama near Carthage, and the Carthaginians were beaten,\r\nbeaten a second time by the Romans. Thus ended the second Punic War in\r\n202 B.C. This is another easy name and easy date--just like a telephone\r\nnumber:\r\n\r\n  Zama--two-O-two.\r\n\r\nThe Romans had won two wars against Carthage; you would think that they\r\nwould now have been satisfied. But they weren’t. They thought they had\r\nnot beaten Carthage badly enough. They were afraid she was not quite\r\ndead or that she might come to life. They thought there might be a\r\nlittle spark left that might start a fire if it weren’t trampled out.\r\n\r\nNow, it is bad sport to pummel your opponent after he is beaten, and\r\nCarthage was beaten--beaten, black and blue--there was no hope of her\r\n“coming back.” And yet a few years later the Romans attacked her again\r\nfor the third and last time.\r\n\r\nCarthage was unable to defend herself, and the Romans viciously burned\r\nthe city to the ground. It is said they even plowed over the land\r\nso that no trace of the city should remain, and sowed it with salt\r\nwhich prevented anything growing there. After that Carthage was never\r\nrebuilt, and now it is hard to tell even where the old city once was.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\nThe New Champion of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can well imagine how proud all the Romans now were that they _were_\r\nRomans, for Rome was the champion fighter of the world. If a man could\r\ntoss his head and say, “I am a Roman citizen,” people were always ready\r\nto do something for him, afraid to do him any harm, afraid what might\r\nhappen to them if they did. Rome was ruler not only of Italy but of\r\nSpain and Africa. Like other nations before her, once she had started\r\nconquering, she kept on conquering, until by 100 B.C. she in her turn\r\nwas ruler of almost all the countries bordering the Mediterranean\r\nSea--all except Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe New Champion of the World, who was to be champion for a great many\r\nyears, was very businesslike and practical.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks loved beautiful things, beautiful buildings, beautiful\r\nsculpture, beautiful poems. The Romans copied the Greeks and learned\r\nfrom them how to make many beautiful things, but the Romans were most\r\ninterested in practical and useful things.\r\n\r\nFor example, now that Rome ruled the world, she had to be able to send\r\nmessengers and armies easily and quickly in every direction to the\r\nend of her empire and back again. So it was necessary for her to have\r\nroads, for of course there were no railroads then. Now, an ordinary\r\nroad made by simply clearing away the ground gets full of deep ruts and\r\nin rainy weather becomes so muddy that it can hardly be used at all.\r\n\r\nSo Rome set to work and built roads. These roads were like paved\r\nstreets. Large rocks were placed at the bottom for a foundation,\r\nsmaller stones placed on top, and large, flat paving-stones laid\r\nover all. Thousands of miles of such roads she built to all parts of\r\nher empire. One could go from almost anywhere all the way to Rome on\r\npaved roads. We still have an expression, “All roads lead to Rome.” So\r\nwell were these roads made that many of them still exist to-day, two\r\nthousand years after they were built.\r\n\r\nThe Romans also showed their practical minds by making two very\r\nimportant city improvements. If you live in a city, you turn on a\r\nspigot and you get plenty of pure water whenever you want it. The\r\npeople in cities at that time, however, usually had to get their water\r\nboth for drinking and for washing from wells or springs near-by. These\r\nsprings and wells often became dirty and made the people very sick.\r\nAnd so every once in a while because of such dirty water there were\r\nthose terrible plagues, those terribly contagious diseases like the one\r\nI told you about in Athens when people died faster than they could be\r\nburied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Aqueduct.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans wanted pure water, and so they set to work to find lakes\r\nfrom which they could get pure water. As oftentimes these lakes were\r\nmany miles away from the city, they then built big pipes to carry the\r\nwater all the way to the city. Such a pipe was not made of iron or\r\nterra-cotta as nowadays, but of stone and concrete, and was called an\r\n“aqueduct,” which in Latin means “water-carrier.” If this aqueduct had\r\nto cross a river or a valley, they built a bridge to hold it up. Many\r\nof these Roman aqueducts are still standing and in use to-day.\r\n\r\nNow, up to this time waste water, after it had been used, and also\r\nevery other kind of dirt and refuse, was simply dumped into the street.\r\nThis naturally made the city or town filthy and unhealthy and was\r\nanother cause of plagues. But the Romans built great underground sewers\r\nto carry off this dirt and waste water and empty it into the river or\r\ninto some other place where it would do no harm and cause no sickness.\r\nNowadays, every large city has aqueducts and sewers as a matter of\r\ncourse, but the Romans were the first to build them on a large scale.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things that Rome did was to make rules that\r\nevery one had to obey; laws, we call them. Many of these laws were so\r\nfair and just that some of our own laws to-day are copied from them.\r\n\r\nAll the cities and towns of the Roman Empire had to pay money or taxes\r\nto Rome. So Rome became the richest city in the world. Millions of this\r\nmoney, which was brought to her, was spent in putting up beautiful\r\nbuildings in the city, temples to the gods, splendid palaces for the\r\nrulers, public baths and huge open-air places called amphitheaters\r\nwhere the people could be amused.\r\n\r\nThe amphitheaters were something like our football and baseball fields\r\nor stadiums. They did not have football or baseball, however. They\r\nhad chariot-races, and deadly fights between men, or between men and\r\nanimals. Chariots were small carts with large wheels drawn by two or\r\nby four horses and driven by a man standing up. Perhaps you have seen\r\nchariot-races in the circus.\r\n\r\nBut the sport that the Romans enjoyed most of all was a Fight of\r\nGladiators. Gladiators were very strong and powerful men who had been\r\ncaptured in battle by the Romans. They were made to fight with one\r\nanother or with wild animals for the amusement of the crowd. These\r\ngladiatorial fights were very cruel, but the Romans enjoyed seeing\r\nblood shed. They liked to see one man kill another or a wild animal. It\r\nwas so amusing. The movies would not have interested them half so much.\r\nUsually the gladiators fought until one or the other was killed, for\r\nthe people were not, as a rule, satisfied until this was done.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, if a gladiator, who had been knocked out, had shown\r\nhimself particularly brave and a good fighter or a good sport, the\r\npeople seated all around the amphitheater would turn their thumbs _up_\r\nas a sign that his life was to be spared by the other gladiator. So the\r\nwinning gladiator, before killing his opponent whom he had down, would\r\nwait to see what the people wished. If they turned their thumbs _down_,\r\nit meant he was to finish the fight by killing his man.\r\n\r\nBut although Rome had become such a fine and beautiful and healthy\r\ncity in which to live, the rich people were getting most of the money\r\nthat came there from all over the empire. They were getting richer\r\nand richer all the time, while the poor people, who got nothing, were\r\ngetting poorer and poorer all the time. The Romans brought the people\r\nwhom they conquered in battle to Rome and made them work for them\r\nwithout pay. These were slaves and they did all the work. It is said\r\nthat there were more than twice as many slaves as Romans--two slaves\r\nfor every Roman citizen.\r\n\r\nNow, Scipio, who had conquered Hannibal in the Punic War, had a\r\ndaughter named Cornelia Graccha, and she had two sons. They were very\r\nfine boys, and Cornelia was naturally very proud of them.\r\n\r\nOne day a very rich Roman woman was visiting Cornelia and showing off\r\nall her rings and necklaces and other ornaments, of which she had a\r\ngreat many and was very proud.\r\n\r\nWhen she had shown off all she had, she asked to see Cornelia’s jewels.\r\n\r\nCornelia called to her two boys, who were playing outside, and when\r\nthey came in to their mother she put her arms around them and said:\r\n\r\n“_These_ are _my_ jewels.”\r\n\r\nBut boys who are jewels when they are young do not always turn out to\r\nbe jewels when they grow up. So you may wonder how Cornelia’s jewels\r\ntinned out.\r\n\r\nWhen they grew up, the Gracchi, as they were called, saw such great\r\nextravagance among the rich and such great misery among the poor that\r\nthey wanted to do something about it. They saw that the poor had hardly\r\nanything to eat and no place to live. This did not seem fair. So they\r\ntried to lower the price of food, so that the poor might be able to buy\r\nenough to eat. Then they tried to find some way to give the poor at\r\nleast a small piece of land where they might raise a few vegetables.\r\nThey were partly successful in bringing this about. But the rich people\r\ndidn’t like giving up anything to the poor, and they killed one of the\r\nGracchus brothers, and later they killed the other one, also. These\r\nwere Cornelia’s jewels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\nThe Noblest Roman of Them All\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s a puzzle for you:\r\n\r\nA man once found a very old piece of money that had on it the date “100\r\nB. C.”\r\n\r\nThat couldn’t be so. Why not? See if you can tell without looking at\r\nthe answer at the bottom of the page.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] People living 100 years before Christ was born could not have known\r\nwhen he was to be born and so could not put such a date on the coins\r\nthey made.\r\n\r\nIn the year 100 B. C. was born in Rome a boy who was named Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nIf you had asked him when he was born, he would have said in the Year\r\n653.\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose?\r\n\r\nBecause Roman boys counted time from the founding of Rome in 753 B. C.,\r\nand Cæsar was born 653 years after the city was founded. That makes it\r\n100 years before Christ, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\n_Pirates_ seemed to be everywhere in the Mediterranean Sea at that\r\ntime--_Pirates_. Now that Rome was ruler of the world, there were many\r\nships carrying gold from different parts of the empire to Rome. So\r\nthe pirates sailed up and down, lying in wait to capture and rob these\r\nships laden with gold.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar grew to be a young man, he was sent off to sea to fight\r\nthese pirates, and he was captured by them. The pirates kept Cæsar a\r\nprisoner and sent to Rome saying they would not let him go unless Rome\r\nsent them a great deal of money. Cæsar knew that he would be killed if\r\nthe money was not sent. He knew, too, that he might be killed, anyway.\r\nBut he was not only not afraid but he told the pirates that if he lived\r\nto get back home he would return with a fleet and punish every one of\r\nthem. When at last the money came they let him go, nevertheless. They\r\nthought Cæsar would not dare to do what he said. They thought he was\r\njust “talking big.” At any rate, they did not believe he would be able\r\nto catch them. Cæsar, however, kept his word, came back after them as\r\nhe said he would do, and took them prisoners. Then he had them all put\r\nto death on the cross, which was the Roman way of punishing thieves.\r\n\r\nThe far-off places of the Roman Empire were always fighting against\r\nRome trying to get rid of her rule, and had to be kept in order by a\r\ngeneral with an army. As Cæsar had shown such bravery in fighting the\r\npirates he was given an army and sent to fight two of these far-off\r\nplaces--Spain and a country north of Spain then known as Gaul, which\r\nis now France.\r\n\r\nCæsar conquered these countries, and then he wrote a history of his\r\nbattles in Latin, which of course was his own language. Nowadays this\r\nbook, called “Cæsar’s Commentaries,” is usually the first book which\r\nthose who study Latin read.\r\n\r\nIn 55 B. C. Cæsar crossed over in ships to the island of Britain, which\r\nis now England, conquered it, and went back again next year in 54 B. C.\r\n\r\nCæsar was becoming famous for the way he conquered and ruled over the\r\nwestern part of the Roman Empire. Besides this, he was very popular\r\nwith his soldiers.\r\n\r\nNow there was in Rome at this time another general named Pompey. Pompey\r\nhad been successfully fighting in the eastern part of the Roman Empire\r\nwhile Cæsar had been fighting in the west. Pompey had been a great\r\nfriend of Cæsar, but when he saw how much land Cæsar had conquered and\r\nhow popular he was with his soldiers, he became very jealous of him.\r\nNotice how many quarrels and wars are caused simply by jealousy. You\r\nhave heard of at least two already.\r\n\r\nSo while Cæsar was away with his army Pompey went to the Roman Senate\r\nand persuaded the senators to order Cæsar to give up the command of\r\nhis army and return to Rome.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar received the order from the Senate to give up his command\r\nand return to Rome, he thought over the matter for some time. Then at\r\nlast he made up his mind that he would return to Rome, but he would\r\n_not_ give up his command. Instead, he decided that he and his army\r\nwould take command of Rome itself.\r\n\r\nNow, there was a little stream called the Rubicon which separated the\r\npart of the country over which Cæsar was given charge from that of\r\nRome. The Roman law forbade any general to cross this stream with an\r\narmy ready to fight--this was the line beyond which he must not pass,\r\nfor the Romans were afraid that if a general with an army got too close\r\nto Rome he might make himself king.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar decided not to obey the Senate, he crossed this stream--the\r\nRubicon--with his army and marched on to Rome.\r\n\r\nPeople now speak of any dividing line from danger as “the Rubicon”\r\nand say that a person “crosses the Rubicon” when he takes a step from\r\nwhich there is no turning back, when he starts something difficult or\r\ndangerous which he must finish.\r\n\r\nWhen Pompey heard that Cæsar was coming he took to his heels and fled\r\nto Greece. In a few days Cæsar had made himself head not only of Rome\r\nbut of all Italy. Cæsar then went after Pompey in Greece and in a\r\nbattle with his army beat him badly.\r\n\r\nNow that Pompey was out of the way, Cæsar was the chief ruler of the\r\nwhole of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nEgypt did not yet belong to Rome. So Cæsar next went there and\r\nconquered that country. Now, in Egypt there was ruling a beautiful\r\nqueen named Cleopatra. Cleopatra was so charming that she seemed able\r\nto make every one fall in love with her. Cleopatra flirted with Cæsar\r\nand so fascinated him that he almost forgot everything else except\r\nmaking love to her. So although he had won Egypt he made Cleopatra\r\nqueen over that country.\r\n\r\nJust at this time some people in the far eastern part of the empire\r\nstarted a war to get rid of the rule of Rome. Cæsar left Egypt,\r\ntraveled rapidly to the place where the enemy were, made quick work\r\nof conquering them, then sent back the news of his victory to Rome\r\nin the most laconic (do you remember what that means?) description\r\never given of a battle. There were only three words in the message.\r\nAlthough the messenger could have carried three thousand as easily as\r\nthree words, Cæsar sent a message that would have been short even for a\r\ntelegram. He wrote, “Veni, vidi, vici,” which means, “I came, I saw, I\r\nconquered.”\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar at last got back to Rome, the people wanted to make him\r\nking, or said they did. Cæsar was already more than king, for he was\r\nhead of the whole Roman Empire. But he wasn’t called king, for there\r\nhad been no kings since 509 B. C., when Tarquin was driven out. The\r\nRomans had been afraid of kings and hated them, or were supposed to\r\nhate them.\r\n\r\nA few of the people thought that Cæsar was getting too much power\r\nand believed it would be a terrible thing to make him a king. They,\r\ntherefore, decided on a plot to prevent such a thing happening. One of\r\nthese plotters was a man named Brutus who had been Cæsar’s very best\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nOne day when Cæsar was expected to visit the Roman Senate they lay in\r\nwait for him until he should appear--in the same way I have seen boys\r\nhide around the corner for some schoolmate, against whom they had a\r\ngrudge, until he should come out of school.\r\n\r\nCæsar came along, and just as he was about to enter the Senate the\r\nplotters crowded around him, and one after another they stabbed him.\r\n\r\nCæsar, taken by surprise, tried to defend himself; but all he had\r\nwas his stylus, which was a kind of pen he used for writing, and he\r\ncould not do much with that, in spite of a famous saying, “The pen is\r\nmightier than the sword.”\r\n\r\nWhen at last Cæsar saw Brutus--his best friend--strike at him, his\r\nheart seemed broken and he gave up. Then, exclaiming in Latin, “Et tu,\r\nBrute!” which means, “And thou, O Brutus!” he fell down dead. This was\r\nin 44 B.C.\r\n\r\nAntony, one of Cæsar’s true friends, made a speech over Cæsar’s dead\r\nbody, and his words so stirred the crowd of people that gathered round\r\nthat they would have torn the murderers to pieces if they could have\r\ncaught them.\r\n\r\nShakspere has written a play called “Julius Cæsar,” and the month of\r\nJuly is named after him.\r\n\r\nNow whom do you suppose Antony called “The Noblest Roman of Them All”?\r\n\r\n“Julius Cæsar”?\r\n\r\nNo, you’re wrong. Brutus, the friend who stabbed Cæsar, was called,\r\n“The Noblest Roman of Them All.”\r\n\r\nWhy, do you suppose?\r\n\r\nYou’ll have to read Antony’s speech at the end of the play to find out.\r\n\r\nCæsar was pronounced in Latin “Kaiser”; and in later years the rulers\r\nof Germany were called this, and those of another country by the\r\nshortened form, “Czar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\nAn Emperor Who Was Made a God\r\n\r\n\r\nA man is famous who has a town or a street named after him.\r\n\r\nWill you ever do anything great enough to have even an alley named\r\nafter you?\r\n\r\nBut just suppose a month, one of the twelve months of the year, was\r\ngiven your name!\r\n\r\nMillions upon millions of people would then write and speak your name\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nBut I’m going to tell you about a man who not only had a month named\r\nafter him but who was made a god!\r\n\r\nAfter Cæsar had been killed, three men ruled the Roman Empire. One of\r\nthese three men was Antony, the friend of Cæsar, who made the famous\r\nspeech over his dead body. The second was Cæsar’s adopted son, who was\r\nnamed Octavius. The name of the third you don’t need to know now, for\r\nAntony and Octavius soon got rid of him. Then no sooner had they forced\r\nhim out than each of these two began to plot to get the share of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAntony’s share, over which he ruled, was the eastern part of the\r\nempire. The capital of this part was Alexandria in Egypt, and so\r\nAntony went there to live.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt Antony fell in love with Cleopatra, as Cæsar before him had\r\ndone, and he finally married her.\r\n\r\nOctavius, in the west, which was his share, then made war on Antony and\r\nCleopatra together, and in the end beat them both. Antony felt so bad\r\nat being beaten by Octavius that he committed suicide.\r\n\r\nHis widow, Cleopatra, thereupon, flirted with Octavius as she had with\r\nJulius Cæsar and Antony, hoping to make him also fall in love with her\r\nand so win him in that way.\r\n\r\nBut it was no use. Octavius was a different kind of man from both\r\nJulius Cæsar and Antony. He was cold-blooded and businesslike. He had\r\nno heart for love-making. He would not let a woman charm him or turn\r\nhim aside from his plan, which was to be the greatest man in the world!\r\n\r\nCleopatra saw that it was no use trying her tricks on him. Then she\r\nheard that she was going to be taken back to Rome and paraded through\r\nthe streets, as was done with any other prisoners taken in battle. She\r\ncould not stand such a shame as that, and so she made up her mind she\r\nwould not be taken back to Rome.\r\n\r\nNow, in Egypt there is a kind of snake called an asp, which is deadly\r\npoisonous. Taking one of these asps in her hand, she uncovered her\r\nbreast and let it bite her, and so she died.\r\n\r\nOctavius was now ruler over all the countries that belonged to\r\nRome, and when he returned home to that city, the people hailed him\r\n“Emperor.” He then gave up the name Octavius and had himself called\r\n“Augustus Cæsar,” which is like saying, “His Majesty, Cæsar.” This was\r\nin 27 B.C. Rome had got rid of her kings in 509. From now on she had\r\nemperors, who were more than kings, for they ruled over many countries.\r\n\r\nOctavius, now with his name changed to Augustus Cæsar, was only\r\nthirty-six years old when he became sole master of the Roman world.\r\nRome was the great capital of this vast empire. The city of Rome had\r\nprobably as many people as New York City proper now has, and the Roman\r\nEmpire had perhaps as many people as the United States has at present.\r\n\r\nAugustus set to work to make Rome a beautiful city. He tore down a\r\ngreat many of the old buildings made of brick and put up in their place\r\na remarkable number of new and handsome buildings of marble. And so\r\nAugustus always bragged that he found Rome brick and left it marble.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest buildings in Rome, the Pantheon, was built. Pantheon\r\nmeans the temple of all the gods. Do not mix this with the Parthenon\r\nin Athens, for the two buildings are quite different, and though the\r\nnames look something alike and sound something alike, they mean quite\r\ndifferent things; Parthenon is from the goddess Athene Parthenos;\r\nPantheon is from the two words “Pan theon,” which means “all gods.”\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon has a dome built of concrete. This dome is shaped like a\r\nbowl turned upside down, and in the top of the dome is a round opening\r\ncalled an eye. Though this eye is uncovered, the height is so great\r\nabove the floor that it is said that rain coming through the eye does\r\nnot wet the floor beneath but evaporates before reaching it.\r\n\r\nSo magnificent did the city become with all these wonderful buildings,\r\nand so permanently did it seem to be built, that it was known as The\r\nEternal City and is still so spoken of.\r\n\r\nThere was a public square in Rome called the Forum. Here markets were\r\nheld and the people came together for all sorts of things. Around the\r\nForum were erected temples to the gods, court-houses, and other public\r\nbuildings. These court-houses were something like the temples that the\r\nGreeks built, only the columns were put on the inside of the building\r\ninstead of on the outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman forum.]\r\n\r\nTriumphal arches also were erected to celebrate great victories. When a\r\nconquering hero returned from the war, he and his army passed through\r\nthis arch in a triumphal parade.\r\n\r\nThere had been in Rome a great amphitheater that is supposed to have\r\nheld more people than any structure that has ever been built--two\r\nhundred thousand, it is said, or more than all the people who live in\r\nsome good-sized cities. This was called the Circus Maximus. It was at\r\nlast torn down to make room for other buildings.\r\n\r\nAnother amphitheater was the Colosseum, but this was not built until\r\nsome time after Augustus had died. It held about the same number as\r\nthe largest stadium in this country does to-day. Here were held those\r\nfights between men, called gladiators, and wild animals that I have\r\nalready told you about. It is still standing, and, though it is in\r\nruins, you can sit in the same seats where the old Roman emperors did,\r\nsee the dens where the wild animals were kept, the doors where they\r\nwere let into the arena, and even bloody marks that are said to be the\r\nstains made by the slain men and beasts.\r\n\r\nSo many famous writers lived at the time of Augustus that this has been\r\ncalled the Augustan Age. Two of the best known Latin poets, whom every\r\nschool-boy now reads after he has finished “Cæsar’s Commentaries,”\r\nlived at this time. These poets were Vergil and Horace. Vergil wrote\r\nthe “Æneid,” which told of the wanderings of Æneas, the Trojan, who\r\nsettled in Italy, and was the great-great-great-grandfather of Romulus\r\nand Remus. Horace wrote many short poems called Odes. They were\r\nlove-songs of shepherds and shepherdesses and songs of the farm and\r\ncountry life. People liked his songs, and many still name their sons\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nWhen Augustus Cæsar died, he was made a god, because he had done so\r\nmuch for Rome; temples were built in which he was worshiped, and the\r\nmonth of August was named after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n“Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory”\r\n\r\n\r\nAugustus Cæsar had been Ruler of the World.\r\n\r\nHe had found Rome brick and left it marble.\r\n\r\nHe had had a month named after him, and\r\n\r\nHe had been made a god!\r\n\r\nSurely no one could ever be greater than he! Yet a greater than he was\r\nliving at the very same time--a greater ruler of a greater kingdom with\r\ngreater power and greater glory, although Augustus himself knew nothing\r\nabout Him and lived and died without ever having heard of Him. This\r\nMan was born in the eastern part of Augustus’s empire in a tiny little\r\nvillage called Bethlehem, and His name was Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nFor many, many years after Christ was born no one except His family and\r\nfriends knew or cared anything about His birth or paid the slightest\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nChrist was a Jew, the son of a carpenter. As a boy and young man He\r\nled a very simple and quiet life working in His father’s shop. He did\r\nnot begin to preach until He was more than thirty years old. Then He\r\nwent about teaching the people what we learn to-day as the Christian\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nHe taught that there was one God over all.\r\n\r\nHe taught brotherly love, that one should love one’s neighbor as\r\noneself.\r\n\r\nHe taught the golden rule; that is, “do unto others as you would be\r\ndone by.”\r\n\r\nHe taught that there was a life after death for which this short life\r\non earth was only a preparation; that therefore you should “lay up your\r\ntreasures in heaven” by doing good works here.\r\n\r\nThe poorer Jews listened to Christ and believed what He taught them.\r\nBut they thought He was going to set them free from the rule of the\r\nRomans, which they hated. The Jewish priests, however, were afraid of\r\nwhat Christ taught. He was teaching some things that were just the\r\nopposite of what they themselves taught. So they plotted to have Him\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\nNow, the Jews could not put Christ to death without the permission of\r\nthe Roman ruler of that part of the empire where Christ lived. This\r\nruler was named Pilate. So they went to Pilate and told him that Christ\r\nwas trying to make himself king. Christ of course meant and always said\r\nthat He was a heavenly ruler and not an earthly king. The Jews knew\r\nthat Pilate would not care at all what religion Christ taught. There\r\nwere all sorts of religions in the Roman Empire--those that believed\r\nin mythological gods and those that believed in idols and those that\r\nbelieved in the sun, moon, and so on--one more new religion made little\r\ndifference to the Romans, and Christ would not be put to death simply\r\nfor teaching another. But the Jews knew if they could make Pilate\r\nbelieve that Christ was trying to make himself a king, that was a thing\r\nHe could be crucified for. Pilate did not believe much in what the\r\nJews said against Christ. It was a small matter to him, one way or the\r\nother, however. But he wanted to please the Jews, so he told them to go\r\nahead and put Christ to death if they wanted to. So He was crucified.\r\n\r\nChrist had chosen twelve men to teach what He told them. These twelve\r\nmen were called apostles. After Christ was crucified these apostles\r\nwent through the land teaching the people what Christ had taught them.\r\nThose who believed in and followed His teachings were called disciples\r\nof Christ or Christians. The apostles were teachers; the disciples were\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nThe Romans thought these disciples of Christ were trying to start a\r\nnew world empire, and that they were against Rome and the emperor and\r\nshould be arrested and put in prison. So the Christians usually held\r\ntheir meetings in secret places, sometimes even underground, so that\r\nthey would not be found and arrested.\r\n\r\nBut after a while the leaders of the Christians became bolder. They\r\ncame out of their secret places and taught and preached openly,\r\nalthough they knew they would sooner or later be thrown into prison and\r\nperhaps killed. Indeed, so strongly did they believe in the teachings\r\nof Christ that they seemed even glad to die for His sake, as He had\r\ndied on the cross for them.\r\n\r\nIn the first hundred years after Christ, there were a great many\r\nChristians put to death because they were thought traitors. Christians\r\nwho died for Christ’s sake were called martyrs. The first martyr was\r\nnamed Stephen. He was stoned to death about 33 A.D.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who helped in putting Stephen to death was a man\r\nnamed Saul. Saul was a Roman citizen and, like other Roman citizens,\r\nwas proud of that fact. He thought the Christians were enemies of\r\nhis country, and he did everything he could to have the Christians\r\npunished. Then, all of a sudden, Saul had a change of heart and came to\r\nbelieve in the religion of the very people whom he had been fighting.\r\nWhatever Saul did or whatever he believed he did or believed with his\r\nwhole soul. Though he had never seen Christ, he became one of the\r\nchief Christians and then was made an apostle and was called by his\r\nRoman name, Paul.\r\n\r\nPaul preached the new religion far and wide just as earnestly as he had\r\nfought against it at first. Then he, too, was condemned to death. Paul,\r\nhowever, was, as I have said, a Roman citizen, and a Roman citizen\r\ncould not be put to death by the ordinary judges who were not Roman\r\ncitizens nor in the ordinary way by crucifying. So Paul appealed to\r\nthe emperor. Nevertheless, he was put in prison in Rome and afterward\r\nbeheaded. And so he is called St. Paul.\r\n\r\nPeter was another of the chief apostles. Christ had said to him, “I\r\nwill give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.”[2] Peter, too,\r\nwas thrown into prison, and was sentenced to be crucified. But he asked\r\nto be crucified with his head downward. He thought it too great an\r\nhonor to die in just the same way as his Lord. On this spot in Rome\r\nwhere Peter was put to death was built long afterward the largest\r\nchurch in the world, the Cathedral of St. Peter.\r\n\r\n[2] Matthew, xvi, 19.\r\n\r\nAs everything before Christ’s birth is called B.C. and everything since\r\nHis birth is called A.D., you would naturally suppose that 0 would be\r\nthe date of His birth.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until some five hundred years later that people began\r\nto date from Christ’s birth. And then, when they did begin to date\r\nfrom this event, they made a mistake. It was found out that Christ was\r\nreally born four years before He was supposed to have been born--that\r\nis, in 4 B.C.--but when the mistake was found out, it was then too late\r\nto change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\nBlood and Thunder\r\n\r\n\r\nI once had a big Newfoundland dog, and he was one of the best friends\r\na boy ever had. I don’t know who it was that named him; he was named\r\nbefore I got him; but whoever it was must either have been ignorant of\r\nhistory or a bad chooser of names. He was called Nero, and even a dog\r\nwould have hated such a name, had he known whose it once was.\r\n\r\nEvery good story usually has a villain to make it interesting. Nero is\r\nthe prize villain of history. He was a Roman emperor who lived not long\r\nafter Christ, and he is considered the most terribly cruel and wicked\r\nruler that ever lived.\r\n\r\nHe killed his mother.\r\n\r\nHe killed his wife.\r\n\r\nHe killed his teacher, who was named Seneca. He was not a bad teacher,\r\neither.\r\n\r\nWe think that Nero ordered both St. Peter and St. Paul put to death,\r\nfor they were executed at this same time.\r\n\r\nNero seemed to take great pleasure in making others suffer. He loved to\r\nsee men torn to pieces by wild beasts; it amused him greatly. I have\r\nseen boys who liked to throw stones at dogs just to hear them yelp, or\r\ntear the wings off of butterflies. Such boys must have some Nero in\r\nthem; don’t you think?\r\n\r\nIf a man was a Christian, that gave Nero an excuse to torture him\r\nhorribly. Nero had some of the Christians wrapped in tar and pitch,\r\nthen placed around the garden of his palace and set fire to, as if\r\nthey were torches. It is even said that Nero set Rome on fire just for\r\nthe fun of seeing the city burn. Then he sat in a tower and, while he\r\nwatched the blaze spreading, played on a harp. The saying is that “Nero\r\nfiddled while Rome burned”; but there were no fiddles at that time, and\r\nso we know it must have been a harp. The fire burned day and night for\r\na whole week and destroyed more than half of the city. Then Nero laid\r\nthe blame on the Christians, who, he said, started the fire. Did you\r\never blame another for something you had done?\r\n\r\nSome think Nero really was crazy, and we hope he was, for it is hard to\r\nthink any human being who was not crazy could act as he did.\r\n\r\nNero built himself an immense palace and overlaid it extravagantly with\r\ngold and mother-of-pearl. It was known as Nero’s House of Gold. At its\r\nfront door he put up a colossal statue of himself in bronze fifty feet\r\nhigh. Both the House of Gold and the statue were later destroyed,\r\nbut the Colosseum, which was built a few years afterward, was named\r\nColosseum from this “coloss-al” statue of Nero that was once there.\r\n\r\nNero was very conceited. He thought he could write poetry and sing\r\nbeautifully. Although he did both very badly, he liked to show off, and\r\nno one dared to laugh at him. Had any one been so bold as to make fun\r\nof him or even to smile, he would have had that person put to death\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nEven the Roman people who were not Christians feared and hated Nero.\r\nSo they voted to have him put out of the way. But before they had a\r\nchance to do anything, Nero heard what they were planning, and in order\r\nto save himself the disgrace of being put to death by his own people\r\nhe decided to kill himself. He was such a coward, however, that he\r\ncouldn’t quite bring himself to plunge the sword into his heart. But\r\nas he hesitated, holding the sword to his breast and whimpering, his\r\nslave, impatient to finish the job, shoved the blade in. Thus was Rome\r\nrid of its worst ruler.\r\n\r\nSo much for the first part of this “blood and thunder” story. Here is\r\nthe second part:\r\n\r\nThe Jews in Jerusalem didn’t like to have Rome rule over them. They\r\nnever had. But they were afraid to do much about it. But in the Year\r\n70 A.D. they rebelled; that is, they said they would no longer obey\r\nRome or pay her money. The emperor sent his son, who was named Titus,\r\nwith an army to put an end to the rebellion, to punish them as if they\r\nwere disobedient children.\r\n\r\nThe Jews crowded into their city of Jerusalem to make a last stand\r\nagainst the Romans. But Titus destroyed that city completely and the\r\nJews in it, a million of them, it is supposed. Then he robbed the great\r\ntemple of all its valuable ornaments and brought them back to Rome.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate this victory over Jerusalem an arch was built in the Forum\r\nat Rome, and through this arch Titus and his army marched in triumph.\r\nOn this arch was carved a procession, showing Titus leaving the city\r\nof Jerusalem with these ornaments. Chief among these ornaments was a\r\ngolden seven-branched candlestick he had taken from the temple. To-day\r\nwe see many copies in brass of this famous seven-branched candlestick.\r\nPerhaps you may have one in your home on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThe city was rebuilt later, but most of the Jews who were left have\r\never since been living in all the other countries of the earth.\r\n\r\nTitus became emperor, but in spite of the way in which he had massacred\r\nso many Jews, he was not such a bad emperor as you might suppose. He\r\nthought he was doing right in killing these men because they had\r\nrebelled against Rome. But Titus had a rule of life, much like that the\r\nBoy Scouts now have. This rule was, “Do at least one good turn a day.”\r\n\r\nThe third part of this story is the “thunder.”\r\n\r\nIn Italy there is a volcano named Vesuvius. You remember that “volcano”\r\ncame from the name “Vulcan,” the blacksmith god, and people imagined\r\nthat his forge in the heart of a volcano made the smoke and flame and\r\nashes. From time to time this volcano, Vesuvius, thunders and quakes\r\nand spouts forth fire and throws up stones and gas and boils over with\r\nred-hot melted rock called lava. It is the hot inside of the earth\r\nexploding. Yet people build houses and towns near-by and live even\r\non the sides of the volcano. Every once in a while their homes are\r\ndestroyed when the volcano quakes or pours forth fire. Yet the same\r\npeople go right back and build again in the same place!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vesuvius erupting, Pompeii in foreground.]\r\n\r\nThere was at the time of Titus a little town named Pompeii near the\r\nbase of Vesuvius. Wealthy Romans used to go there to spend the summer.\r\nSuddenly, one day in the year 79 A.D., just after Titus had become\r\nemperor, Vesuvius began to spout forth fire. The people living in\r\nPompeii rushed for their lives, but they hadn’t time to get away. They\r\nwere smothered with the gases from the volcano before they hardly had\r\ntime to move and, falling down dead, were buried deep in a boiling rain\r\nof fire and ashes, just where they happened to be when the eruption, as\r\nit was called, took place.\r\n\r\nThe people and their houses lay buried beneath the ashes for nearly\r\ntwo thousand years, and in the course of time every one had forgotten\r\nthere ever had been such a place. People came back as they had before\r\nand built houses over the spot where every one had forgotten there once\r\nwas a city. Then one day a man was digging a well over the spot where\r\nPompeii had once been. He dug up a man’s hand--no, not a real hand,\r\nbut the hand of a statue. He told others, and they set to work and dug\r\nand dug to see what else they could find until the whole town was dug\r\nout. And now one can go to Pompeii and see it very much as it was in 79\r\nA.D., before it had ever been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere are houses of the Romans who went there to spend their vacations.\r\nThere are shops and temples and palaces and public baths and the\r\ntheater and the market place or forum. The streets were paved with\r\nblocks of lava, once melted stone. They still show ruts which were worn\r\ninto them by the wheels of the chariots that the Romans used to drive.\r\nStepping-stones were placed at some crossings, so that in case of heavy\r\nrains, when the streets were full of water, one could cross on them\r\nfrom curb to curb. These stepping-stones are still there. The floors of\r\nthe houses were made of bits of colored stone to form pictures. They\r\nare still there. In the vestibule of one house, there is in the floor\r\na mosaic picture of a dog. Under it are the Latin words, “Cave canem.”\r\nWhat does that mean? Can you guess? It means, “Look out for the dog!”\r\nThat was a Roman’s idea of a joke two thousand years ago!\r\n\r\nThe bones of the people who were caught and buried alive in the ashes\r\nwere also found. There were also found bronze ornaments worn by the\r\nwomen, vases that decorated the home, lamps which they used to light\r\nthe houses, pots and pans and dishes. Beds and chairs were found just\r\nas they had been buried. Still more remarkable, cakes were found on the\r\ntable, a loaf of bread half eaten, meat ready to be cooked, a kettle on\r\nthe fire with the ashes still underneath it--beans and peas and _one\r\negg_ unbroken--probably the oldest egg in the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\nA Good Emperor and a Bad Son\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever said, “I don’t care,” when you really did care?\r\n\r\nI have. Every one has.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have been naughty and have been told you could have no\r\ndessert or must go to bed early, and you tossed your head and said, “I\r\ndon’t care.”\r\n\r\nWell, once upon a time there was a society or club formed of grown-up\r\npeople who said they weren’t ever going to care what happened to them;\r\nwhether it was good or whether it was bad would make no difference.\r\nI should call them the “Don’t Care Club,” but they called themselves\r\n“Stoics,” and they thought the way to be good was “not to care.”\r\n\r\nIf a Stoic’s house burned down, he would say to himself and try to make\r\nhimself believe, “I don’t care; it doesn’t matter.”\r\n\r\nIf some one gave him a million dollars, he would say, “I don’t care; it\r\ndoesn’t matter.”\r\n\r\nIf he was told by the doctor he was going to die next week, he would\r\nsay, “I don’t care; it doesn’t matter.”\r\n\r\nThis Society of Stoics was started by a Greek philosopher named Zeno.\r\n\r\nZeno lived in Athens later than those philosophers, Socrates and Plato,\r\nwhom you have already heard about. Zeno said that the only way to be\r\ngood and the only way to be happy was not to care for pleasure and not\r\nto mind pain or suffering but calmly to put up with everything, no\r\nmatter how unpleasant or disagreeable it was, and the Stoics believed\r\nhim. Even to-day people who bear troubles and pain and hardships\r\nwithout a murmur are called stoics.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief members of the society was a Roman emperor.\r\n\r\nRome’s worst emperor, Nero, had been dead a hundred years when there\r\ncame to the throne this new emperor, who was just as good as Nero was\r\nbad. This emperor was named Marcus Aurelius. Although he was so very\r\ngood and pious, he was not a Christian. Indeed, Marcus Aurelius treated\r\nthe Christians terribly, as they had been treated terribly by the\r\nprevious emperors, for he thought them traitors to the empire.\r\n\r\nAt this time most of the Romans had very little religion of any sort.\r\nThey were not Christians, but neither did they put much faith in their\r\nown gods, Jupiter and Juno and the rest. They honored them because\r\nthey were brought up to honor them and because they thought if they\r\ndidn’t honor them they might have bad luck, so they took no chances.\r\nBut instead of believing in such gods, people usually believed in the\r\nteachings of some wise man or philosopher and obeyed more or less the\r\nrules he made. Zeno was one of these philosophers, and the Stoics were\r\nthe members of this society.\r\n\r\nAlthough Marcus Aurelius was an emperor, he would rather have been a\r\nStoic philosopher or a priest. Although he had to be a soldier and a\r\ngeneral, he would rather have been a writer. When he was off, fighting\r\nwith his army, he carried his writing-materials with him, and he would\r\ngo to his tent at night and write out his thoughts. These thoughts he\r\ncalled his “Meditations.” Here is one of the things he wrote:\r\n\r\n When you find you do not want to get up early in the morning, make\r\n this short speech to yourself. I am getting up now to do the business\r\n of a man. Was I made to do nothing but doze and keep warm under the\r\n covers?\r\n\r\nThat was written long years ago, yet your father might have told you\r\nthe same thing this morning.\r\n\r\nPeople read this book of Marcus Aurelius to-day, either in the Greek in\r\nwhich it was written or translated into English.\r\n\r\nA great many of Marcus Aurelius’ sayings seem almost as if they might\r\nhave been in the Bible. Indeed, some people keep his book by their\r\nbedside as if it were a Bible.\r\n\r\nOne of his rules was, “Forgive your enemies,” and he seemed almost\r\nglad to have enemies so that he might have a chance to forgive them.\r\nIndeed, he took such a special delight in forgiving his enemies that\r\nhe even went out of his way to do so. Though Marcus Aurelius was not a\r\nChristian, nevertheless he was more Christian in the way he acted than\r\nsome of the later emperors who were supposed to be Christians.\r\n\r\nBut like many people who are very good themselves, Marcus Aurelius was\r\nunable to bring up his son to be so. His son was named Commodus, and\r\nCommodus was just as bad as his father was good. He may have been bored\r\nwhen a child by too many of his father’s instructions, for when he grew\r\nup and was able to choose for himself and do as he pleased, instead of\r\nfollowing Zeno and joining the Stoics, he joined the society of another\r\nphilosopher called Epicurus.\r\n\r\nEpicurus had lived about the same time as Zeno. But he had taught\r\nwhat at first seems almost the opposite of what Zeno taught. Epicurus\r\nsaid that the chief end and aim of man and the only good in the world\r\nwas pleasure; _but_, said he, the pleasure must be of the right kind.\r\nNowadays people who are very fond of eating nice things, whose whole\r\nthought in life is the pleasure of eating, are called “epicures.”\r\n\r\nCommodus’s one thought was pleasure, and the worst kind of pleasure at\r\nthat. A friend of mine thought Marcus Aurelius was such a fine man that\r\nhe named his son after him, “Marcus Aurelius Jones,” but when the son\r\ngrew up he was not at all like his namesake. The name “Commodus” would\r\nhave suited him much better, for instead of being good and pious, he\r\nthought of nothing but pleasure and he was so bad that he ended in jail.\r\n\r\nCommodus thought nothing of giving his people a good government; he\r\nonly thought of giving himself a good time. He was an athlete and had\r\nbeautiful muscles and a handsome figure, of which he was so proud that\r\nhe had a statue made of himself. The statue showed him as the strong\r\nand muscular god Hercules. Commodus made the people worship him as\r\nif he were this god. Just to show off his muscles and his muscular\r\nability, he himself took part in prize-fights--quite bad taste for\r\nan emperor. He poisoned or killed any one who found fault with or\r\ncriticized him. He led a wild and dissipated life, but at last he met\r\nthe end he deserved. He was strangled to death by a wrestler.\r\n\r\nLycurgus would have said again:\r\n\r\n“I told you so.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\nI-- H-- S---- V-----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of this story I’m going to put at the end, for you wouldn’t\r\nknow what it means, anyway, until you have heard the story, and so it’s\r\nno use looking ahead.\r\n\r\nAll through the years since Christ was crucified, those who said they\r\nbelieved in Christ had been terribly treated--“persecuted,” we call\r\nit--because they were Christians. They had been flogged; they had been\r\nstoned; they had been torn with iron hooks; they had been roasted and\r\nburned to death. Yet, strange as it may seem, in spite of this terrible\r\ntreatment, more and more people were becoming Christians every day.\r\nThey believed so strongly in life after death, and they believed that\r\nthey would be so much happier after death if they died for Christ’s\r\nsake, that they seemed even glad to suffer and to be killed. But at\r\nlast the emperor himself put a stop to all these persecutions. This is\r\nhow it happened.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 300 A.D. Rome had an emperor by the name of Constantine.\r\nConstantine was not a Christian. His gods were the old Roman gods. He\r\nprobably did not put much faith in them, however.\r\n\r\nWell, once upon a time Constantine was fighting with an enemy when he\r\ndreamed one night that he saw in the sky a flaming cross. Beneath this\r\ncross were written the Latin words, “In hoc signo vinces.” In English\r\nthis is, “In this sign thou shalt conquer.” Constantine thought this\r\nmeant that if he carried the Christian cross into battle he would\r\nconquer. He thought it would at least be worth while to give the\r\nChristian God a trial. So he had his soldiers carry the cross, and he\r\ndid win the battle. Then immediately he became a Christian himself and\r\nasked every one in the Roman Empire to become a Christian also. From\r\nthat time on, all the Roman emperors who came after Constantine, all\r\nexcept one, were Christians.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate Constantine’s victory the Roman Senate built a triumphal\r\narch in the Forum of Rome and called it the Arch of Constantine. If has\r\nthree openings; the Arch of Titus has only one.\r\n\r\nConstantine’s mother was named Helena. She was one of the very first\r\nto become a Christian and be baptized. Then she gave up her life to\r\nChristian works and built churches at Bethlehem and on the Mount of\r\nOlives. It is said that she went to Palestine and found the actual\r\ncross on which Christ had been crucified three hundred years before and\r\nsent part of it to Rome. When she died she was made a saint, and so\r\nshe is now called St. Helena.\r\n\r\nConstantine built a church over the spot where St. Peter was supposed\r\nto have been crucified. Many years later, this church was torn down so\r\nthat a much larger and grander church to St. Peter might be built there.\r\n\r\nBut Constantine did not care for Rome. He preferred to live in another\r\ncity in the Eastern part of the Roman Empire. This city was called\r\nByzantium. So he moved from Rome to Byzantium and made that city his\r\ncapital. Byzantium was called New Rome, and then the name was changed\r\nto Constantine’s city. In Greek, the word for “city” is “polis.” We see\r\nthe word used in Anna_polis_ and Indiana_polis_. So Constantine’s City\r\nbecame Constantinepolis, and then shortened to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Roman Empire become Christian before a quarrel arose\r\nbetween those Christians who believed one thing and those who believed\r\nanother. The chief thing they quarreled about was whether Christ was\r\nequal to God the Father or not equal to Him. Constantine called the\r\ntwo disagreeing sides together at a place called Nicæa to settle the\r\nquestion. There the leaders of each side argued the matter hotly.\r\nFinally, it was decided that the Christian Church should believe that\r\nGod the Son and God the Father were equal. Then they agreed to put\r\nwhat they believed in words. This was called a creed, which means\r\n“believe,” and because it was made at Nicæa it was known as the Nicene\r\nCreed, which many Christians still say every Sunday.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of Constantine, there were no weekly holidays. Sunday\r\nwas no different from any other day. People worked or did just the\r\nsame things on Sunday as they did on other days. Constantine thought\r\nChristians should have one day a week for the worship of God--a “holy\r\nday,” or holiday, as we call it--so he made Sunday the Christian day of\r\nrest, a “holy day” such as Saturday was for the Jews.\r\n\r\nBut although Constantine was head of the Roman Empire, there was\r\nanother man whom all Christians throughout the world looked to as their\r\nspiritual head. This man was the Bishop of Rome. In Latin he was called\r\n“papa,” which means the same thing in Latin that it does in English,\r\n“father.” So the bishop of Rome was called “papa,” and this became\r\n“pope.” St Peter was supposed to have been the first Bishop of Rome.\r\nFor many centuries the pope was the spiritual ruler of all Christians\r\neverywhere, no matter in what country they lived.\r\n\r\nAs now you know what the name of this story means I’m putting it here:\r\n\r\n In Hoc Signo Vinces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\nOur Tough Ancestors\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Rome with the Roman Empire had had her day. She had risen as high\r\nas she could. It was her turn to fall. She had become as large as she\r\never was to be. It was her turn to be conquered. But you cannot guess\r\nwhat people were to do the conquering and to be next in power.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy there was a gang of toughs who lived down by the\r\ngas-house and railroad tracks. They were ragged, unwashed, unschooled,\r\nbut terrible fighters. Their leader was known to us as Mug Mike, and\r\nthe very mention of him and his gang struck terror to our souls. Every\r\nnow and then they paid our neighborhood a visit. Once we had offered\r\nfight, but with such terrible results that ever after at word of their\r\napproach the alarm would be sounded and we would hide indoors.\r\n\r\nFor ages there had been such a gang of half-civilized toughs living on\r\nthe northern borders of the Roman Empire. Every now and then they tried\r\nto cross over the border into the Roman lands, and the Romans had to\r\nbe constantly fighting them to keep them back where they belonged.\r\nJulius Cæsar had fought with them. So had Marcus Aurelius and so had\r\nConstantine. These wild and warlike people were called Teutons and--you\r\nmay be shocked to hear it, but--they are the ancestors of most of us!\r\n\r\nThey had light hair and blue eyes; that is, they were what we call\r\nblonds. The Greeks and Romans and other people who lived around the\r\nMediterranean Sea had black hair and dark eyes. They were what we call\r\nbrunettes. If you have light or brown hair, you are probably a Teuton.\r\nIf you have black hair, you are probably not.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons were white people, and they were Aryans, but they were\r\nuneducated toughs and could neither read nor write.\r\n\r\nThey wore skins of animals instead of clothes made of cloth. They lived\r\nin huts made of wood, sometimes of branches woven together--like a\r\nlarge basket. The women raised vegetables and took care of the cows\r\nand horses. The men did the hunting and fighting and blacksmithing.\r\nBlacksmithing was very important, for the blacksmith made the swords\r\nand spears with which they fought and the tools with which they worked.\r\nThat is why the name “Smith” was so honored among them.\r\n\r\nWhen the men went to battle they wore the heads of animals they had\r\nkilled, an ox’s head, horns and all, or the head of a wolf or bear or\r\nfox. This was to make themselves look fierce and to frighten the enemy.\r\n\r\n_Bravery_ was the chief thing the Teuton thought good. A man might lie,\r\nhe might steal, he might even commit murder, but if he was a brave\r\nwarrior, he was called a “good” man.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons did not have a king. They elected their chiefs, and of\r\ncourse they always chose the man who was the bravest and strongest.\r\nBut he could not make his son ruler after him. So he was more like a\r\npresident than a king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Teuton warrior.]\r\n\r\nThe Teutons had an entirely different set of gods from those of Greece\r\nand Rome. Their chief god, as you might guess, was the god of war, and\r\nthey called him Woden. Woden was also the god of the sky. He was like\r\nthe two Greek gods, Jupiter and Mars, put together. Woden was supposed\r\nto live in a wonderful palace in the sky called Valhalla, and many\r\ntales are told of the wonderful things he did and of the adventures he\r\nhad. Wednesday, which was once Wodensday, is named after him. That is\r\nwhy there is a letter “d” in this word, although we don’t pronounce it.\r\n\r\nAfter Woden, Thor was the next most important god. He was the god\r\nof thunder and lightning. He carried a hammer with which he fought\r\ngreat giants who lived in the far-off cold lands and were called\r\n“ice-giants.” Thursday, which was once Thorsday, is named after him.\r\n\r\nAnother god was named Tiu, and from his name we get Tuesday, and\r\nanother Freya, from whom we get Friday, so that four out of seven of\r\nour days are named after Teuton gods, in spite of the fact that we\r\nare--most of us--Christians and no longer believe in these gods.\r\n\r\nOf the other three days of the week, Sunday and Monday of course are\r\nnamed after the sun and moon, and Saturday is named after a Greek god,\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\nFrom these wild people all fair-haired people to-day are said to\r\nbe descended--the English, French, German, and such of us whose\r\nforefathers are English or French or German.\r\n\r\nAbout the Year 400 A.D. these Teuton toughs were becoming particularly\r\ntroublesome to the Romans. They began to push their way down into the\r\nnorthern part of the Roman Empire, and after a few years the Romans\r\ncould hold them back no longer. Two of these Teuton gangs, or tribes,\r\nas they were called, went over into Britain, and the Romans who were\r\nliving there found it wisest to get out, go back to Rome, and leave the\r\ncountry to the Teutons.\r\n\r\nThese tribes who settled in Britain were known as Angles and Saxons. So\r\nthe country came to be called the land of the Angles, or, for short,\r\n“Angle-land.” After the words “Angle-land” were said over for many\r\nyears, they became “England,” which is what we call the country to-day.\r\nThe people of England are still known by the full name “Anglo-Saxons,”\r\nand this is the name by which we call everything descended from these\r\nold Teuton tribes of Angles and Saxons who settled in Britain about 400\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nAnother gang or tribe called the Vandals went into Gaul. Gaul is where\r\nFrance is now. Then they kept on down into Spain, stealing, smashing,\r\nand burning like Mug Mike’s gang of toughs on Hallowe’en. They crossed\r\nover by boats into Africa. They injured or destroyed everything they\r\ncame upon. So to-day when any one damages or destroys property\r\nwickedly, we call him a vandal. If you cut up your desk, tear your\r\nbooks, or scratch names on walls or fences, you, too, are a vandal.\r\n\r\nA tribe called the Franks followed the Vandals into Gaul, and there\r\nthey stayed, giving the name “France” to that country.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons north of Italy were the Goths. They had a leader by the\r\nname of Alaric. He was the “Mug Mike” of the gang of Goths. Alaric and\r\nhis Goths crossed over the mountains into Italy and robbed or destroyed\r\neverything of value they could lay their hands on. They then entered\r\nRome and carried away whatever they wanted, and the Romans could not\r\nstop them. But the worst was yet to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\nWhite Toughs and Yellow Toughs Meet the Champions of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Teutons were wild toughs but they were white.\r\n\r\nFarther north of the Teutons and to the east was a tribe of people who\r\nwere still more savage and fierce. They were called Huns. They lived\r\nfar off in the forests and wilds way beyond the Teutons, in a part of\r\nthe country that no one then knew much about.\r\n\r\nThe Huns were, we think, not white as the Teutons were, but yellow.\r\nEven the Teutons themselves, fierce fighters though they were, feared\r\nthe Huns, and it was chiefly because they were afraid of them and\r\nwanted to get away from them as far as they could that the Teutons went\r\nover the borders into the Roman Empire. It was much easier to fight the\r\nRomans than it was to fight the Huns.\r\n\r\nThe Huns seemed more like wild beasts than human beings. Their leader\r\nwas a dreadful creature named Attila. He boasted that nothing ever grew\r\nagain where his horse had trod. He and his Huns had conquered and laid\r\nwaste the country all the way from the East almost to Paris. At last\r\nthe Teutons made a stand against them and fought a great battle at a\r\nplace not so very far from Paris, a place called Châlons.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons fought desperately; they fought madly. It was white toughs\r\nagainst yellow toughs, and the Huns were beaten. It was lucky they\r\nwere beaten, for if they had won, these dreadful wild, yellow people\r\nmight have conquered and ruled the world. The white toughs were\r\nbad enough, but the yellow would have been worse. So the battle of\r\nChâlons, 451 A.D., is written in history in capital letters and large\r\nfigures--CHÂLONS 451.\r\n\r\nAfter Attila and his Huns had been beaten at Châlons they left the\r\nTeutons alone, but they then went after the Romans. Turning back they\r\nwent down into Italy, where there was no one able to stop them. They\r\ndestroyed everything as they moved on. The people of the country didn’t\r\neven attempt to fight. They thought the Huns were monsters and simply\r\nfled before them. So on to Rome the Huns went.\r\n\r\nNow, there was at Rome at this time a Pope named Leo I, which means\r\nLion. Leo, of course, was neither a soldier nor a fighting man, but he\r\nand his cardinals and bishops went out from Rome to meet Attila. They\r\nwere not clad in armor, and none of them carried any weapons with which\r\nto fight. The pope and those with him were dressed in gorgeous robes\r\nand richly colored garments. It seemed as if they must be slaughtered\r\nby Attila and his Huns like lambs before wolves.\r\n\r\nBut something strange happened when Attila and the pope met; exactly\r\nwhat no one knows. Perhaps Attila was awed by the pomp and splendor of\r\nthose Christians. Perhaps he feared what Heaven might do to him if he\r\ndestroyed those holy beings who had come out to meet him as if from\r\nheaven. At any rate, he did not destroy them, nor did he enter Rome,\r\nbut turned about and left Italy, left it for good and all, and he and\r\nhis Huns returned to the unknown land to the north from which they had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nNow that the dreaded Attila was out of the way, the Vandals in Africa\r\nsaw their chance to attack Rome. Attila had barely left Italy before\r\nthe Vandals crossed over from Africa and sailed up the Tiber to Rome.\r\nThey captured the city without any difficulty, helped themselves to\r\neverything they wanted, and carried away all Rome’s treasures.\r\n\r\nPoor old Rome! She was at last beaten, beaten for good! She had been\r\nthe Champion for a great many years. But now all her strength was gone.\r\nShe was old and weak and no longer able to defend herself against\r\nthese gangs of toughs. Rome’s last emperor had the high-sounding name\r\n“Romulus Augustulus,” the same name as the first king, Romulus, with\r\nthe addition of Augustulus, which means the little Augustus. But in\r\nspite of his high-sounding name, Romulus Augustulus could do nothing.\r\nHe was like the little boy living in the marble house on the avenue,\r\nthe little boy with curls and a velvet suit, whom Mug Mike caught out\r\none day and--you can guess the rest. “Great Cæsar’s ghost!” How Cæsar’s\r\nghost must have felt!\r\n\r\nIt was the Year 476 that Rome was beaten. The western half of the\r\nempire, of which Rome had been the capital, broke up into pieces, and\r\nthe pieces were ruled over by Teutons. Like Humpty Dumpty, Rome had had\r\na great fall, and all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t\r\nput it together again. Only the eastern part, of which Constantinople\r\nwas the capital, still went on. This eastern half was not conquered by\r\nthe barbarians, and it still kept going for nearly a thousand years\r\nlonger until--but wait till we come to that time in history.\r\n\r\nPeople speak of this date, 476, as the end of Ancient History. After\r\nAncient History, there was a time over five hundred years long which\r\nwas known as the Dark Ages--the Night-time of History. The Dark Ages\r\nlasted from 476 to about 1000 A.D. These centuries are called the Dark\r\nAges, because during that long time the Teutons, those uneducated\r\ntoughs who were unable even to read and write, were the chief people in\r\nEurope, and they ruled over those who had once been the educated and\r\ncultured people.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons, though such rough toughs, barbarians as they were called,\r\nwere, strange to say, quick to learn many things from the Romans whom\r\nthey had conquered. Even before they had conquered Rome, most of the\r\nTeutons had already become Christians.\r\n\r\nOf course they had to learn the Latin language in order to talk to\r\ntheir subjects. But they changed the Latin a good deal and mixed it\r\nwith their own language. This mixture of their own language with the\r\nLatin at last became Italian. The Teutons who went to Spain in a like\r\nway mixed their language with the Latin, and this mixture was Spanish.\r\nIn France the mixture of the two languages became French.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, however, the Anglo-Saxons would have nothing to do with\r\nthe Romans and would not use the Roman language but kept their own\r\nlanguage. After a while this language of the Anglo-Saxons was called\r\nEnglish. The Anglo-Saxons also kept their own religion, and they\r\nworshiped Thor and Woden and their other gods until about one hundred\r\nyears later, or about 600 A.D.\r\n\r\nAt that time some English slaves were being sold in the slave-market\r\nat Rome. They were very handsome. The pope saw them and asked who they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n“They are Angles,” he was told.\r\n\r\n“Angles!” exclaimed he; “they are handsome enough to be ’angels,’ and\r\nthey should certainly be Christians.”\r\n\r\nSo he sent some missionaries to England to convert the English;\r\nto change Angles to Angels. So at last the English, too, became\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\nNightfall\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 500 o’clock by History Time.\r\n\r\nNight was coming on.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Ages had begun.\r\n\r\nAt least, that is what people call it now. But people didn’t call it so\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nCrazy people don’t think they are crazy.\r\n\r\nIgnorant people don’t think they are ignorant.\r\n\r\nSo the Dark Ages didn’t think they were dark.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant Teutons were ruling over the pieces of the Western Empire.\r\n\r\n  They couldn’t read; they couldn’t write.\r\n  They didn’t know much except to fight.\r\n  They didn’t know ’twas dark as night.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople, however, a Roman was still ruling over the Eastern\r\nEmpire. This Roman was named Justinian. Now, up to this time there had\r\nbeen a great many rules or laws by which the people were governed. But\r\nthere were so many of these rules and they were so mixed up that one\r\nlaw would tell you you could do one thing and another would tell you\r\nyou couldn’t. It was as if your mother said you could stay up till nine\r\no’clock to-night and your father said you must go to bed at eight. It\r\nwas hard for people to tell, therefore, what one must do and what one\r\nmust not do.\r\n\r\nIn order to untangle this snarl, Justinian had a set of laws made for\r\nthe government of his people, and many of these were so good and so\r\njust that they are still the law to-day. If you notice that Justinian\r\nbegins with “Just,” this will help you to remember that he was the one\r\nwho made _just_ laws.\r\n\r\nAnother thing Justinian did that has lasted to the present time. He\r\nbuilt in Constantinople a very beautiful church called Santa Sophia.\r\nThough it is no longer a church, it is still standing after all these\r\nyears and is a beautiful sight to see. Still another thing he did\r\nwhich you could never guess. It had nothing to do with war or law or\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nTravelers from the Far East, where China now is, had brought back\r\ntales of a wonderful caterpillar that wound itself up with a fine,\r\nthin thread over a mile long, and they told stories of how the Chinese\r\nunwound this thread and wove it into cloth of the finest and smoothest\r\nkind. This thread, as you might guess, was called silk, and the\r\ncaterpillar that made it was called the silkworm. People in Europe\r\nhad seen this beautiful silk cloth, but how it was made had been a\r\nmystery--a secret. They thought it so wonderfully beautiful that it was\r\nsupposed to have been made by fairies or elves or even sent down from\r\nheaven. Justinian found out about these caterpillars and had men bring\r\nthese silkworms into Europe so that his people also might make silk\r\ncloth and have silk ribbons and fine silk garments, and therefore we\r\ngive him the honor of starting the manufacture of silk in Europe.\r\n\r\nOutside of Justinian’s empire the ignorant Teutons were living. It took\r\nthem nearly a thousand years to learn as much as any school-boy now\r\nknows, and the first thing they learned was not reading, nor writing,\r\nbut the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Justinian lived there was a king in France\r\nnamed Clovis. Clovis, of course, was a Teuton and belonged to the tribe\r\ncalled the Franks, which gave the name “France” to that country. Clovis\r\nbelieved in Thor and Woden as all of his people did. Clovis had a wife\r\nnamed Clotilda, whom he loved very dearly. Clotilda, though a Teuton,\r\nthought all the fighting and cruelty which her people seemed to like\r\nwas wrong. She had heard about the religion of Christ, which did not\r\nbelieve in quarreling and fighting, and she thought she would like to\r\nbe a Christian. So she was baptized. Then she tried to persuade her\r\nhusband, Clovis, to become a Christian, also.\r\n\r\nClovis was just then going to war--the very thing the Christians\r\npreached against. But, just to please his wife, he promised her, if he\r\nwon the battle, he would become a Christian. He did win, and he kept\r\nhis word and was baptized and had his soldiers baptized, also. Clovis\r\nmade Paris his capital, and Paris is still the capital of France.\r\n\r\nIt was about this same time, also, that a king named Arthur was ruling\r\nin England. Many stories and poems have been written about him, which,\r\nhowever, we know are fairy-tales and not history. But although we know\r\nthese stories are not true, they are, nevertheless, interesting--like\r\nthose tales that are told about the heroes of the Trojan War.\r\n\r\nIt was said that there was a sword called Excalibur stuck so fast in a\r\nstone that no one could draw it out except the man who should be king\r\nof England. All the nobles had tried without success to draw the sword,\r\nwhen one day a young boy named Arthur pulled it out with the greatest\r\nease, and he was accordingly proclaimed king.\r\n\r\nKing Arthur chose a company of the nobles to rule with him, and as they\r\nsat with him at a Round Table, they were known as the Knights of the\r\nRound Table. Tennyson, the great English poet, has written in verse an\r\naccount of all the doings of King Arthur and his knights in a long poem\r\ncalled “The Idylls of the King,” which you will have to read yourself,\r\nfor we must go on to the next story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\n“Being Good”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by “being good”?\r\n\r\nThe Teutons thought “being good” meant being brave.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians thought whatever was beautiful was “good.”\r\n\r\nThe Stoics thought “not caring” was “being good.”\r\n\r\nThe Epicureans thought having a good time was “being good.”\r\n\r\nThe martyrs thought “being good” meant suffering and dying for Christ’s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nEver since the time of the martyrs, Christians who wanted to be very,\r\nvery good indeed, went off into the wilderness and lived by themselves.\r\nThey wished to be far away from other people, so that they could spend\r\nall their time praying and thinking holy thoughts. This, they believed\r\nwas “being good.”\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest of these men who wanted to get away from others\r\nwas named St. Simeon Stylites. He built for himself a pillar or column\r\nfifty feet high, and on the top of it he lived with room only to sit\r\nbut not to lie down. There on the top he lived for many years, day\r\nand night, winter and summer, while the sun shone on him and the rain\r\nrained on him, and he never came down at all. He could be reached only\r\nby a ladder, which his friends used to bring him food. High up out of\r\nthe world, he thought he could best lead a holy life. That was his idea\r\nof “being good” although we should think such a person simply crazy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, however, men who wanted to lead holy lives,\r\ninstead of living alone as they had done at first, gathered in groups\r\nand built themselves homes. These men were called monks, and the house\r\nwhere they lived was known as a monastery or abbey. The head monk of\r\nsuch an abbey was called an abbot, and he ruled over the other monks\r\nlike a father over his children, giving them orders and punishing them\r\nwhen he thought they needed it.\r\n\r\nIn the five hundreds there lived an Italian monk named Benedict. He\r\nbelieved very strongly that one must work if he was to be holy, that\r\nwork was a necessary part of being holy. He thought, also, that monks\r\nshould have no money of their own, for Christ had said in the Bible,\r\n“If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the\r\npoor.” So Benedict started a club or order of monks for those people\r\nwho would agree to three things:\r\n\r\nThe first thing they were to agree to was to have no money.\r\n\r\nThe second thing was to obey.\r\n\r\nThe third thing was not to marry.\r\n\r\nMonks who joined this club were called Benedictines.\r\n\r\nNow, you might think there would have been hardly any one who would\r\npromise for life three such things as to have no money, to obey\r\nthe abbot--no matter what he told them to do--and never to marry.\r\nNevertheless, there were a great many men in every country of Europe\r\nwho did become Benedictines.\r\n\r\nUsually the monks lived in little bare rooms like prison cells, and ate\r\ntheir very simple meals together at a single table in a room called the\r\nrefectory. They prayed at sunrise and sunset, and many times during the\r\nday besides, and they even woke up at midnight to say their prayers.\r\nBut praying was not all they had to do. Work of every kind they were\r\nobliged to do, and they did it joyfully, whether the work was scrubbing\r\nfloors or digging in the garden.\r\n\r\nOftentimes the monastery was situated in a barren or swampy spot on\r\nland that had been given the monks because it was no good, or even\r\nworse than no good, dangerously unhealthy. But the monks set to work\r\nand drained off the water, tilled the soil, and made the waste places\r\nbloom like the rose. Then they raised vegetables for their table,\r\nfodder for their horses and cattle and sheep. Everything they ate or\r\nused or needed, they raised or made.\r\n\r\nBut they did not only the rougher hand-work; they did fine hand-work,\r\ntoo. Printing had not been invented at this time; all books had to be\r\nwritten by hand, and the monks were the ones who did this. They copied\r\nthe old books in Latin and Greek. Sometimes one monk would slowly read\r\nthe book to be copied, and several other monks at one time would copy\r\nwhat he dictated. In this way a number of copies would be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monk writing a manuscript.]\r\n\r\nThe pages of the books were not made of paper but of calfskin or\r\nsheepskin, called vellum, and this vellum was much stronger and lasted\r\nmuch longer than paper.\r\n\r\nThese old books which the monks wrote were called “manuscripts,”\r\nwhich means “hand-written.” Many of these may now be seen in museums\r\nand libraries. Some of these manuscripts have been beautifully\r\nhand-printed with loving care and the initial letters and borders\r\nornamented with designs of flowers and vines and birds and pictures in\r\nred and gold and other colors. If the monks hadn’t done this copying,\r\nmany of the old books would have been lost and unknown to us.\r\n\r\nThe monks also kept diaries, writing down from day to day and year\r\nto year an account of the important things that happened. These old\r\ndiaries, or chronicles, as they were called, tell us the history of the\r\ntimes. As there were then no newspapers, if these chronicles had not\r\nbeen written we should not know what went on at that time.\r\n\r\nThe monks were the best educated people of those days, and they taught\r\nothers--both young and old--the things they themselves knew. The\r\nmonasteries were also inns for travelers, for any one who came and\r\nasked for lodging was received and given food and a place to sleep,\r\nwhether he had any money to pay or not.\r\n\r\nThe monks helped the poor and needy. The sick, too, came to the\r\nmonastery to be treated and taken care of, so that a monastery was\r\noften something like a hospital, too. Many people who had received such\r\nhelp or attention made rich gifts to the monasteries, so they became\r\nvery wealthy, although the monks could own not so much as a spoon for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSo you see the monks were not merely holy men; they were most useful\r\ncitizens. They were in many ways more nearly everything that Christ\r\nwould have wished than perhaps any one large group of men has ever been\r\nsince. They were really “GOOD FOR SOMETHING.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\nA Camel-Driver\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery hundred years is called a century, but a thing that seems a\r\nlittle strange is this--the hundred years from 500 to 600 is called the\r\n_sixth_ century, not the fifth; the hundred years from 600 to 700 is\r\ncalled the _seventh_ century, not the sixth; and so on. Thus 615, 625,\r\n650, and so on are all _seventh_ century.\r\n\r\nWell, we have now reached the seventh century--the six hundreds, and we\r\nare to hear of a man who was to make a change in the whole world. He\r\nwas neither a Roman nor a Greek nor a Frank nor a Goth nor a Briton. He\r\nwas neither a king nor a general, but only a--\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose?\r\n\r\nA CAMEL-DRIVER!\r\n\r\nand he lived in a little town called Mecca in far-off Arabia. His name\r\nwas Mohammed. Mohammed went on an errand for a wealthy Arabian lady,\r\nand the lady fell in love with him. Although he was a poor camel-driver\r\nand only a servant and she was rich, they were married. They lived\r\nhappily together, and nothing remarkable happened until Mohammed was\r\nforty years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Saracenic empire showing Mecca, Medina,\r\nConstantinople, Tours, Cordova, Bagdad, Jerusalem, also Europe.]\r\n\r\nMohammed had been in the habit of going out to a cave in the desert to\r\nstudy and think. One day when he visited this cave he had a dream, or\r\na vision, as it is called when such things happen in the daytime when\r\none is awake. In this vision, so Mohammed said, the angel Gabriel had\r\nappeared and told him that God, whom the Arabs called Allah, said he\r\nmust go forth and teach the people a new religion.\r\n\r\nSo Mohammed went home to his wife and told her what had happened, and\r\nshe believed his story and became his first follower. Mohammed then\r\nwent forth as he had been directed and taught his relatives and friends\r\nwhat he said Allah had told him, and they, too, believed what he said\r\nand became his followers.\r\n\r\nBut when he set out to teach others, who were not his friends nor\r\nrelatives, they simply thought him crazy and perhaps dangerous. So they\r\ngot together and planned to get rid of him--even kill him if necessary.\r\nBut he heard what they were planning, and so he packed up all his\r\nbelongings and, with his wife and those who believed in him, left the\r\ncity of Mecca and fled to the town of Medina, a little way off. This\r\nwas in 622--Six-Two-Two--and was called the Hegira, which in the Arabic\r\nlanguage means “flight.”\r\n\r\nI have told you this exact date, for later as you will see this\r\nreligion, which Mohammed started, grew bigger and bigger, and now\r\nat this very day there are one third as many people who believe in\r\nMohammed and the religion he started as there are who believe in Christ\r\nand the religion He started; that is, there are now one third as many\r\nMohammedans in the world as there are Christians. The Mohammedans began\r\nto count from the Hegira, 622, calling it the Year 1 as the Christians\r\ndid from the Birth of Christ, as the Greeks did from the First\r\nOlympiad, as the Romans did from the Founding of Rome. So the Greeks,\r\nthe Romans, the Mohammedans, and the Christians each had a different\r\nYear 1.\r\n\r\nThis new religion was called Islam. From time to time Mohammed received\r\nmessages which he said came from God. Mohammed himself could neither\r\nread nor write, and so he had some one else write down these messages\r\non palm-leaves. There were so many of these messages that when they\r\nwere finally gathered together they made a big book. This book is\r\ncalled the “Koran,” and it is the Mohammedan Bible and tells what\r\nMohammedans must do and what they must not do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muezzin on minaret calling to prayer.]\r\n\r\nAs Mohammed was born in Mecca, Mecca is the sacred city of the\r\nMohammedans. To Mecca each good Mohammedan tries to go at least once\r\nin his lifetime, no matter how far off from it he may live; and toward\r\nMecca he always faces when he prays. There are always pilgrims, as\r\nsuch travelers are called, wending their way to Mecca. The Mohammedans\r\nworship in a temple called a _mosque_, but they also pray five times\r\neach day wherever they may be. A man called a muezzin cries out this\r\ntime for prayer. He goes out on a little balcony on the minaret of the\r\nmosque and calls aloud: “Come to prayer; come to prayer. There is but\r\none god and he is Allah.” Then, no matter who the Mohammedan is, no\r\nmatter where he may be or what he may be doing, even though he is in\r\nthe street or market-place, whether he is working or playing, he faces\r\ntoward Mecca, falls on his knees, bows his head and hands to the ground\r\nand prays. Sometimes he carries a small rug called a prayer-rug with\r\nhim so that he may have something holy to kneel on when he prays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mohammedan praying.]\r\n\r\nMany people liked this new religion. Those who believed in Islam were\r\nknown as Moslems, and before long, as I have told you, there were as\r\nmany Moslems or Mohammedans as there were Christians. At first the\r\nMoslems tried to persuade others to join simply by talking to them and\r\ntelling them how fine their religion was, and how much better than what\r\nthey had already had. But very soon they began to _force_ others to\r\nbecome Moslems whether they wanted to or not. Like the highway robber\r\nwho says, “Money or your life,” they gave every one a choice. “Money\r\nor your life, or be a Moslem!” This may seem a strange way for people\r\nto make others believe their religion, but the Moslems said that Allah\r\nwanted all people to be Mohammedans, and didn’t want any one who was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMohammed only lived for ten years after the Hegira; that is, until 632.\r\nBut those who came after Mohammed went on with the new religion and\r\nkept on conquering and making people Mohammedans with the sword.\r\n\r\nThe new leaders and rulers of the Mohammedans were called caliphs. The\r\nsecond caliph was named Omar. Omar went on to Jerusalem and built a\r\nMohammedan mosque in the place where the temple of Solomon had stood.\r\nThis mosque which Omar built still stands to-day in the same place in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, or Saracens, as they are also called, kept on northward\r\ntoward Europe and conquered and converted every one to Islam as they\r\nwent along. Those they could not convert they put to death. At last\r\nthey reached the City of Constantine, Constantinople, where the people\r\nwere Christians. This was the gateway from Asia to Europe, and the\r\nArabs tried to get by. But the Christians poured down red-hot tar and\r\nburning oil from the walls of the city, and the Moslems had to stop.\r\nThey could get no farther. Again and again the Moslems tried to capture\r\nthe city, but without success. Finally, they had to give up trying to\r\nget into Europe by this way.\r\n\r\nThen they tried the opposite direction from Mecca, the long, long,\r\nway round to Europe. Across Egypt they went with little difficulty,\r\nconverting every one to Islam. Further on still they kept going, along\r\nthe coast of Africa, conquering everything before them until they\r\nreached the ocean. Then they turned north, took boats, and crossed\r\nover the Strait of Gibraltar and marched on up into Spain. Farther and\r\nfarther on they went up into France. It seemed as if they would soon\r\nconquer all of Europe and make the whole civilized world Mohammedan.\r\nBut finally, near the town of Tours in France, they met their match.\r\nThe king of France had a right-hand man named Charles who had been\r\nnicknamed Charles the Hammer because he could strike such terrific\r\nblows. Charles was called Mayor of the Palace, which merely meant that\r\nhe was the chief servant of the king, but he was much more able than\r\nthe king himself. In fact, the king was of very little account.\r\n\r\nCharles the Hammer, with his French soldiers, went forth to meet the\r\nMoslems, and near Tours he beat them so badly that they never attempted\r\nto go farther. So Europe at last was saved from Islam and the Saracens.\r\nThis battle of Tours was in 732, just 110 years from the time of the\r\nHegira. The Mohammedan religion had only been started 110 years before;\r\nyet in this short time the Mohammedans had conquered and converted the\r\nwhole of the country bordering the Mediterranean from Constantinople\r\nall the way round the southern edge and as far up into France as Tours.\r\nThe people south and east of the Mediterranean are still Mohammedans\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have read the “Arabian Nights.” This is the story of\r\n\r\nArabian Days\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moslems had tried to get into Europe by the front gate and failed.\r\n\r\nThey had then tried the back gate and failed.\r\n\r\nBurning tar and oil had stopped them at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nCharles the Hammer had stopped them at Tours.\r\n\r\nSo Europe was saved from the Moslems and from the Moslem religion of\r\nIslam. Yet we may wonder what Europe would have been like if the Moslem\r\nArabs had conquered, for the Arabs were in many ways a great people,\r\nand we have learned many things from them. Here are some of the things.\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians invented our alphabet, but the Arabs invented the\r\nfigures which we use to-day in arithmetic. 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on are\r\ncalled Arabic figures. The Romans used letters instead of figures, V\r\nstood for 5, X for 10, C for 100, M for 1000, and so on. Think how\r\ndifficult it must have been for a Roman boy to add such numbers as\r\n\r\n     IV\r\n     XII\r\n  +  MC\r\n     CXII\r\n     VII\r\n     ----\r\n\r\nThey could not be added up in columns as we do. And when you think\r\nof multiplying and dividing with Roman numbers, it seems almost\r\nimpossible, for example:\r\n\r\n  MCMCXVII\r\n   × XIX\r\n\r\nOccasionally you may see Roman figures still used--on clock-faces, for\r\ninstance--but all the figures that you use every day in your arithmetic\r\nand that your father uses at the bank or store or office are Arabic\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nAnother thing:\r\n\r\nThe Arabs built many beautiful buildings; but these buildings look\r\nquite different from those that the Greeks and Romans and Christians\r\nbuilt. The doors and window-openings, instead of being square or round,\r\nwere usually horseshoe-shaped. On the top of their mosques they liked\r\nto put domes shaped something like an onion, and at the corners they\r\nput tall spires or minarets from which the muezzin could call aloud\r\nthe hour for prayer. They covered the walls of their buildings with\r\nbeautiful mosaics and designs. The Mohammedans, however, were very\r\ncareful that these designs were not copies of anything in nature, for\r\nthey had a commandment in the “Koran” something like the Christian\r\ncommandment, “Thou shalt not make ... any likeness of anything that is\r\nin heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the\r\nwater under the earth.” Because of this commandment they never made\r\ndrawings or pictures of any living thing, neither of plants nor flowers\r\nnor animals. They thought they would be breaking the commandment if\r\nthey did. So they made designs out of lines and curves without copying\r\nanything from nature. These designs were called Arabesques, and\r\nalthough they were not like anything in nature, they were often very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nStill another thing:\r\n\r\nIn Arabia there grew a little bush on which were small berries with\r\nseeds inside. The sheep seemed to like these berries and, when they ate\r\nthem, became very lively. The Arabs themselves tried eating the seeds\r\nof these berries with the same effect. Then they made a drink out of\r\nthese seeds by roasting and grinding them and boiling them in water.\r\nThis was coffee--which the Arabs had discovered and which is now drunk\r\nall over the world.\r\n\r\nStill another thing:\r\n\r\nThe Arabs found out that when the juice of grapes or other fruits or\r\ngrains spoiled, or fermented, as we call it, a peculiar change took\r\nplace. Any one who drank this changed juice became greatly excited and\r\neven crazy. They called the new thing to which these juices changed,\r\n“alcohol,” and they were so much afraid of it and what it did to those\r\nwho drank it that they forbade every Mohammedan to drink anything\r\ncontaining alcohol, such as wine, beer, or whisky. So the Moslems\r\nnot only discovered alcohol, but, believing it to be poison, they\r\nprohibited its use. They have been prohibitionists, therefore, for more\r\nthan a thousand years, while all the rest of the world has been using\r\nwine and beer and other drinks containing alcohol until the United\r\nStates only recently forbade their use in this country.\r\n\r\nStill another thing:\r\n\r\nWoolen cloth which people used for clothes was made from the hair of\r\nsheep or goats. As it took the hair of a great many such animals to\r\nmake a very little cloth, woolen cloth was expensive. The Arabs found\r\nout a way of making cloth from a plant, the cotton plant, which of\r\ncourse was much cheaper. Then in order to decorate the cloth and make\r\nit pretty and attractive, they stamped the plain cloth with wooden\r\nblocks shaped in different forms and dipped in color. This printed\r\ncloth that the Arabs had invented was called calico.\r\n\r\nStill another thing:\r\n\r\nThe Arabs made swords and knives of such wonderful steel that the\r\nblades could be bent double without breaking. The blades were said to\r\nbe so keen they could cut through the finest hair if floated on water,\r\na thing that only the sharpest razor will do, and yet at the same time\r\nso strong that they could cut through a bar of steel. Such swords were\r\nmade in the East at a place called Damascus, which is in Arabia, and in\r\nthe West at a place called Toledo, which is in Spain; and these swords\r\nand knives were known as Damascus or Toledo blades. Unfortunately, no\r\none now knows the Arab’s secret for making such marvelous blades. It is\r\nwhat is called a lost art.\r\n\r\nNear where Babylon once was the Arabs built a city named Bagdad. You\r\nhave heard of it if you have ever read any of the “Arabian Nights,”\r\nfor most of these stories were told about Bagdad. It was the eastern\r\ncapital of the Moslems. There at Bagdad the Arabs built a great school\r\nthat was famous for many, many years. At Cordova in Spain was the\r\nwestern capital of the Moslems, and there they built another great\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mohammedan veiled woman standing by Saracenic ornamented\r\narch.]\r\n\r\nI might tell you many other things these people did--how they invented\r\nthe game of chess, of all games the one that needs the most thought;\r\nhow they made clocks with pendulums to keep time--people had no real\r\nclocks before; how they started wonderful libraries of books; and so\r\non--but this is enough for the present to show you what intelligent\r\npeople they were.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were not Aryans. They belonged to the Semite family, the\r\nsame family to which the Phenicians and Jews belong. The Arabs were as\r\nclever as their cousins the Phenicians, who, you remember, were very\r\nclever, but they were also as religious as their other cousins the\r\nJews, who, you remember, were very religious.\r\n\r\nBut the Moslems had peculiar ideas about women. They thought it was\r\nimmodest for a woman to show her face to men, and so every woman had to\r\nwear a thick veil which hid her face all except her eyes whenever she\r\nwent out where there were men. With such a veil she could see but not\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nBut here are their two most peculiar ideas: they believed women were\r\nonly fit to be slaves to the men, and they thought that a man might\r\nhave as many wives as he wished all at one time!\r\n\r\nSo we may wonder, then, what Europe would really have been like if the\r\nMoslems had conquered all the rest of the world at that time--if they\r\nhad left no country Christian--_if we were all of us Moslems to-day\r\ninstead of Christians_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\nA Light in the Dark Ages\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope had been “dark” for three hundred years. You know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThere were not enough “bright” people to make it light. Ignorant\r\nTeutons had been ruling over the pieces of the old Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were bright, but they were not in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut in 800 there was a very “bright light”--a man--a king--who by his\r\nmight and power was able to join the pieces of Europe together once\r\nagain to form a new Roman Empire. He was not a Roman, however, but a\r\nTeuton, as you can tell from his name, which was Charles. He was a\r\ngrandson of that Charles the Hammer who had stopped the Moslems at\r\nTours, and he was called by the French name Charlemagne, which means\r\nCharles the Great.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne at first was king of France alone, but he was not satisfied\r\nto be king of that country only, and so he soon conquered the countries\r\non each side of him, parts of Spain and Germany. Then he moved the\r\ncapital of his empire from Paris to a place in Germany called\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, which was more convenient than Paris to this larger\r\nempire, and besides at Aix-la-Chapelle there were warm springs which\r\nmade fine baths, and Charlemagne was very fond of bathing and was a\r\nfine swimmer.\r\n\r\nItaly was then ruled over by the pope. But the pope was having a good\r\ndeal of trouble with some tribes in the north of Italy, and he asked\r\nCharlemagne if he wouldn’t come down and conquer them. Charlemagne was\r\nquite ready and willing to help the pope, so he went over into Italy\r\nand easily settled those troublesome tribes. The pope was grateful to\r\nCharlemagne for this and wished to reward him.\r\n\r\nNow, Christians everywhere used to make trips to Rome in order to pray\r\nat the great Church of St. Peter, which had been built over the spot\r\nwhere St. Peter had been crucified. Well, at Christmas-time in the Year\r\n800 Charlemagne paid such a visit to Rome. On Christmas day he went to\r\nthe Church of St. Peter and was praying at the altar when suddenly the\r\npope came forward and put a crown on his head. The pope then hailed him\r\n“Emperor,” and as the pope at that time could make kings and emperors,\r\nCharlemagne became emperor of Italy added to the other countries over\r\nwhich he already ruled. These countries together were really about the\r\nsame as the western part of the old Roman Empire. So Charlemagne’s\r\nempire was now like a new Roman Empire, but with this big difference:\r\nit was ruled over not by a Roman, but by a Teuton.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne started out an ignorant uneducated Teuton, but he was\r\nnot like most other Teutons who didn’t know they were ignorant and\r\ndidn’t care whether they were ignorant or not. He was anxious to know\r\neverything there was to be known. He wanted to be able to do everything\r\nany one could do.\r\n\r\nIn those days when the Teutons were ruling, few people had any\r\neducation, and hardly any one could read or write. Charlemagne wanted\r\nan education, but there was no one in his own country who knew enough\r\nor was able to teach him. In England, however, there was a very learned\r\nmonk named Alcuin. He knew more than any one of that time, and so\r\nCharlemagne invited Alcuin to come over from England and teach him\r\nand his people. Alcuin taught Charles about the sciences; he taught\r\nhim Latin and Greek poetry; he taught him the wisdom of the Greek\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne learned all these things very easily, but when it came to\r\nthe simple matter of learning to read and write he found this too hard.\r\nHe did learn to read a little, but he seemed unable to learn to write.\r\nIt is said that he slept with his writing-pad under his pillow and\r\npractised whenever he awoke. And yet he never learned to write anything\r\nmore than his name. He did not begin to study until he was a grown man,\r\nbut he kept on studying all the rest of his life. Except for reading\r\nand writing, he became, next to his teacher, Alcuin, the best-educated\r\nman in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Charlemagne’s daughters were princesses, he\r\nhad them taught how to weave and sew and make clothes and cook just as\r\nif they had to earn their own living.\r\n\r\nAlthough Charlemagne was such a rich and powerful monarch and could\r\nhave everything he wanted, he preferred to eat plain food and dress\r\nin plain clothes. He did not like all the finery that those about him\r\nloved. One day, just to make his nobles see how ridiculously dressed\r\nthey were in silks and satins, he took them out hunting in the woods\r\nwhile a storm was going on, so that he could laugh at them. That was\r\nhis idea of a good joke. You can imagine how their silk and satin robes\r\nlooked after being soaked with rain, covered with mud, and torn by\r\nbriers. Charlemagne thought it was very funny.\r\n\r\nBut although his tastes were simple in matters of dress, he made his\r\nhome a magnificent palace. He furnished it with gold and silver tables\r\nand chairs and other gorgeous furniture. He built in it swimming-pools\r\nand a wonderful library and a theater and surrounded it with beautiful\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nAt this time and all through the Dark Ages people had a strange way of\r\nfinding out whether a person had stolen or committed a murder or any\r\nother crime. The person suspected was not taken into court and tried\r\nbefore a judge and a jury to see whether he was telling the truth and\r\nhad done the thing or not. Instead he was made to carry a red-hot iron\r\nfor ten steps, or to dip his arm into boiling water, or to walk over\r\nred-hot coals. If he was not guilty it was thought no harm would come\r\nto him, or if he were burned it was thought that the burn would heal\r\nright away. This was called _trial by ordeal_. It probably started\r\nfrom the story told in the Bible of Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego,\r\nwho, you remember, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, had walked through\r\nthe fiery furnace unharmed because they had done no wrong. Strange to\r\nsay, though Charlemagne was so intelligent, he believed in the trial\r\nby ordeal. To-day we have no such cruel and unfair way of finding out\r\nwhether one is guilty or not. Yet we say of a person who has a lot of\r\ntrouble that seems to be a test of his character, “He is going through\r\nan ordeal.”\r\n\r\nWhile Charlemagne was living, there was a caliph in far-off Bagdad\r\nnamed Haroun, which is the Moslem spelling of Aaron. You may have heard\r\nof him if you have read any of the “Arabian Nights,” for the “Arabian\r\nNight” stories were written at this time, and Haroun is described in\r\nthem. Although Haroun was a Mohammedan, not a Christian, and though\r\nhe was ruler of an empire that hated the Christians, nevertheless he\r\nadmired Charlemagne very much. To show how much he thought of him, he\r\nsent him valuable presents; among other things, a clock which struck\r\nthe hours, which you remember, was an invention of the Arabs. This was\r\na great curiosity, for there were then no clocks in Europe. People had\r\nto tell time by the shadow the sun cast on a sun-dial, or else by the\r\namount of water or sand that dripped or ran out from one jar to another.\r\n\r\nHaroun was a very wise and good ruler over the Moslems, and so he came\r\nto be called “al Rashid,” which means “the Just.” Do you remember what\r\nGreek was also called “the Just”?[3] Haroun used to disguise himself as\r\na workman and go about among his people. He would talk with those he\r\nmet along the street and in the market-place, trying to find out how\r\nthey felt about his government and about things in general. He found\r\nthey would talk freely to him when dressed in old clothes, for then\r\nthey did not know who he was but thought him a fellow-workman. In this\r\nway, Haroun learned a great deal about his people’s troubles and what\r\nthey liked or didn’t like about his rule. Then he would go back to his\r\npalace and give orders to have rules and laws made to correct anything\r\nthat seemed wrong or unjust.\r\n\r\n[3] Aristides.\r\n\r\nAfter Charlemagne died there was no one great enough or strong enough\r\nto hold the new Roman Empire together, and once again it broke up into\r\nsmall pieces, and “all the king’s horses and all the king’s men could\r\nnot put it together again.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\nGetting a Start\r\n\r\n\r\nI once knew a boy who had a red birthmark on his arm. It was just the\r\nshape of England on the map, and he used to call it “My England.”\r\n\r\nEngland is just a little island.\r\n\r\nIt was quite an unimportant little island in 900 A.D.\r\n\r\nEngland is still just a little island.\r\n\r\nBut it is now the most important island in the world!\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred years after Charles the Great--that is, 900--there\r\nwas a king of England named Alfred. When Alfred was a boy he had a hard\r\ntime learning to read, for he did not like to study. In those days\r\nmany of the hand-written books made by the monks had pretty drawings\r\nand letters made in bright colors and even in gold. One day Alfred’s\r\nmother showed such a book to her children and promised to give it to\r\nthe one who could read it first. That was a game. Alfred wanted to win\r\nthe book, and so, for the first time in his life, he really tried. He\r\nstudied so hard that in a very short time he had learned to read before\r\nhis brothers and so he won the book.\r\n\r\nWhen Alfred grew up, England was being troubled by pirates. These\r\npirates were cousins of the English--a tribe of Teutons called Danes.\r\nThe English had long ago become Christians and civilized, but their\r\ncousins, the Danes, were still rough and wild. They came over from\r\ntheir own country across the water, landed on the coast of England,\r\nrobbed the towns and villages, and then sailed back to their homes,\r\ncarrying off everything valuable they could lay their hands on--like\r\nbad boys who climb a farmer’s fence and steal apples from his orchard.\r\nAt last the Danes became so bold that they didn’t even run away after\r\nrobbing the country; they were like the bad boys who stick out their\r\ntongues and throw stones at the farmer who comes after them. The king’s\r\narmies went out to punish these pirates, but, instead of beating, they\r\nwere beaten. It began to look as if these Danes, who were able to do\r\npretty much as they pleased, might conquer England and rule over the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nOnce when things looked pretty black for England, King Alfred was\r\nwithout an army. Alone, ragged, tired out, and hungry, he came to the\r\nhut of a shepherd and asked for something to eat. The shepherd’s wife\r\nwas baking some cakes by the fire, and she told Alfred he should have\r\none if he watched them while she went out to milk the cow. Alfred sat\r\ndown by the fire, but in thinking about what he could do to beat the\r\nDanes he forgot all about the cakes, and when the shepherd’s wife\r\nreturned they were all burned. Thereupon she scolded him roundly and\r\ndrove him off, not knowing that it was her king that she was treating\r\nin this way, for he never told her who he was.\r\n\r\nAlfred decided that the best way to fight the Danes was not on land but\r\non the water, and so he set to work to build boats bigger and better\r\nthan those the Danes had. After a while he had something of a fleet,\r\nand the boats he built were bigger than those of the Danes, but they\r\nwere so big that they could not go into shallow water without running\r\naground. The Danes’ boats, on account of their small size, could go\r\nsafely close in to shore. In deep water, however, Alfred’s fleet was\r\nvery strong and powerful. This was the first navy that England ever\r\nhad. England’s navy is now the largest in the world, and Alfred the\r\nGreat was the one who started it more than a thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter fighting with the Danes for many years, Alfred finally thought\r\nit best to make an agreement with them and give them a part of England\r\nto live in if they would promise to stop stealing and live peaceably.\r\nSo the Danes did agree to this, and they settled down peaceably on the\r\nland that Alfred gave them--and then became Christians. After that\r\nthere was no further trouble.\r\n\r\nAlfred made very strict laws and severely punished those who did wrong.\r\nIndeed, it is said that the people of England were so careful to obey\r\nthe law in his reign that one might leave gold by the roadside, and no\r\none would steal it.\r\n\r\nAlfred also brought over learned men from Europe to show his people how\r\nto make things and to teach the boys and girls and the older people how\r\nto read and write. He is also said to have started a school that is\r\nnow one of the greatest places of learning in the world, a university\r\ncalled Oxford that is now more than a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nBut Alfred not only built a navy and made wise laws and started schools\r\nand colleges which the English had not had before; he did many other\r\nuseful things, besides.\r\n\r\nHe invented, for instance, a way of telling time by a burning candle.\r\nYou have heard how wonderful the clock, that which Haroun-al-Rashid\r\nsent to Charlemagne one hundred years before was thought to be.\r\nAlthough striking clocks are, of course, very common nowadays, it was\r\nan extraordinary thing then when there were no clocks nor watches at\r\nall in England. Alfred found out how fast candles burned down and\r\nmarked lines around them at different heights--just the distance apart\r\nthat they burned in one hour. These were called time-candles.\r\n\r\nCandles were also used for lighting, but when they were carried\r\noutdoors they were very likely to be blown out by the wind. So Alfred\r\nput the candle inside of a little box, and in order that the light\r\nmight shine through the box, he made sides of very thin pieces of\r\ncow’s-horn, for glass then was very scarce. This box with horn sides\r\nwas called a horn lamp or “lamphorn,” and after a while this word when\r\nsaid rapidly became “lanthorn,” and finally “lantern,” which we still\r\ncall such a thing to-day, although horn is, of course, no longer used,\r\nbut glass. This is one explanation of the word as the old spelling was\r\n“lanthorn,” but it seems more likely that lantern came from the Latin\r\nword “lanterna.”\r\n\r\nSuch inventions may seem very small and unimportant, and they are when\r\nyou think of the marvelous inventions and wonderful machines that are\r\nmade by the thousands nowadays. These inventions of Alfred were no\r\nmore than the household ideas for which some magazines now offer only\r\na dollar apiece. But I have told you about them just to show you how\r\nignorant and almost barbarian the English, as well as other Teuton\r\ntribes of Europe, were in those days. How much superior were the Arab\r\nthinkers with their striking clocks. The English were just “getting a\r\nstart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\nThe End of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you do if you knew the world was coming to an end next week,\r\nor even next year?\r\n\r\nThe people who lived in the tenth century thought the Bible said[4]\r\nsomething that meant that the world was coming to an end in the Year\r\n1000--which was called the millennium from the Latin word meaning a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n[4] Book of Revelations, chapter xx.\r\n\r\nSome people were glad that the world was coming to an end. They were\r\nso poor and miserable and unhappy here that they were anxious to go to\r\nheaven, where everything would be fine and lovely--if they had been\r\ngood here. So they were particularly good and did everything they could\r\nto earn a place for themselves in heaven when this old world should end.\r\n\r\nOthers were not so anxious to have the world come to an end. But, they\r\nthought, if it were coming to an end so soon, they might as well hurry\r\nup and enjoy themselves here while they still had a chance.\r\n\r\nWell, the Year 1000 came, and nothing happened. At first people simply\r\nthought that a mistake had been made in counting the years--that there\r\nhad not really been one thousand years since Christ’s birth. The years\r\nwent by, and still people waited for the end. They re-read their Bibles\r\nand thought perhaps it meant a thousand years after Christ’s _death_,\r\ninstead of his birth. As time went on, without any change, they began\r\nto think the end was delayed for some reason they could not explain.\r\nBut it was not for many years after the millennium that people came at\r\nlast to realize that the world was not going to stop after all.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while some one who thinks he knows more than others\r\nsays the end of the world is not far off, but we may be quite sure that\r\nthe world will keep on going and that it will keep on going long after\r\nwe have all grown up and died and our children have done the same.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when people were looking for the end of the world there\r\nwas in the north of Europe a tribe of Teutons who were not Christians\r\nand knew and cared nothing about what the Bible said as to the end of\r\nthe world. They belonged to the same family as the Danes who had come\r\nto England in the time of King Alfred. They were called Norsemen or\r\nVikings. They were bold seafaring men, even more hardy and unafraid\r\nthan the Phenician sailors of old. Their boats were painted black and\r\nhad prows carved with figures of sea-monsters or dragons. They sailed\r\nthe northern seas and went farther westward toward the setting sun than\r\nany sailors had ever gone. They had discovered Iceland and Greenland,\r\nand at last under their chief who was named Leif Ericson they reached\r\nthe shores of America. So about the same year that the Christians in\r\nEurope were expecting the end of the world--the Year 1000--the Vikings\r\nhad gone to what they thought was “the end of the world.”\r\n\r\nThey called the new country Vineland or Wineland, because they found\r\ngrapes, from which wine is made, growing there. They did not go far on\r\nshore, however, and they thought this new land was only another small\r\nisland. They had no idea it was a new world. But it was too far away\r\nfrom their own country, and they found wild savages there who made\r\nit so uncomfortable for them that they sailed back home leaving the\r\ncountry for good. The Vikings did nothing more about their discovery,\r\nand people forgot all about this new country until nearly five hundred\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\nReal Castles\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may think that castles belong only in fairy-tales of princes and\r\nprincesses.\r\n\r\nBut about the Year 1000 there were castles almost everywhere over\r\nEurope, and they were not fairy-castles but real ones with real people\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Rome in 476, the Roman Empire was broken to\r\npieces like a cut-up puzzle-map, and people built castles on the\r\npieces, and they kept on building castles up to the fourteen hundreds.\r\nAnd this is why and how people built them and why they at last stopped\r\nbuilding them.\r\n\r\nWhenever any ruler, whether he was a king or only a prince, conquered\r\nanother ruler, he gave to his generals, who had fought with him and\r\nhelped him to win, pieces of the conquered land as a reward instead of\r\npaying them in money. The generals in turn gave pieces of their land to\r\nthe chief men who had been under them and helped them in battle. These\r\nmen who were given land were called lords or nobles, and each lord was\r\ncalled a vassal of him who gave the land. Each vassal had to promise\r\nto fight with his lord whenever he was needed. He could not make this\r\npromise lightly in an offhand way, however. He had to do it formally so\r\nthat it would seem more binding. So the vassal had to kneel in front of\r\nhis lord, place his folded hands between the folded hands of his lord,\r\nand make the solemn promise to fight when called upon. This was called\r\n“doing homage.” Then once a year, at least, thereafter, he had to make\r\nthe same promise over again. This method of giving away land was known\r\nas the Feudal System.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle, drawbridge, moat and knights.]\r\n\r\nEach of these lords or nobles then built himself a castle on the land\r\nthat was given him, and there he lived like a little king with all his\r\nwork-people about him. The castle was not only his home, but it had to\r\nbe a fort as well to protect him from other lords who might try to\r\ntake his castle away from him. So he usually placed it on the top of\r\na hill or a cliff, so that the enemy could not reach it easily, if at\r\nall. It had great stone walls often ten feet or more thick. Surrounding\r\nthe walls there was usually a ditch called a moat filled with water to\r\nmake it more difficult for an enemy to get into the castle.\r\n\r\nIn times of peace when there was no fighting the men farmed the land\r\noutside of the castle; but when there was war between lords, all the\r\npeople went inside the castle walls, carrying all the food and cattle\r\nand everything else they had, so that they could live there for months\r\nor even years while the fighting was going on. A castle, therefore, had\r\nto be very large to hold so many people and animals for so long a time,\r\nand often it was really like a walled town.\r\n\r\nInside the walls of the castle were many smaller buildings to house the\r\npeople and animals and for cooking and storing the food. There might\r\neven be a church or chapel. The chief building was, of course, the\r\nhouse of the lord himself and this was called the _keep_.\r\n\r\nThe main room of the keep was the hall, which was like a very large\r\nliving-room and dining-room combined. Here meals were served at tables\r\nwhich were simply long and wide boards placed on something to hold them\r\nup. These boards were taken down and put away after the meal was over.\r\nThat is where we get the names “boarding” and “boarding-house.” There\r\nwere no forks nor spoons nor plates nor saucers nor napkins. Every one\r\nate with his fingers and licked them or wiped them on his clothes.\r\nTable manners were more like _stable_ manners. The bones and scraps\r\nthey threw on the floor or to the dogs, who were allowed in the room.\r\nItchy-scratchy! At the end of the meal a large bowl of water and towels\r\nwere brought in so that those who wished might wash their hands.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the household was entertained during the long evenings\r\nwith songs and stories by men called minstrels, who played and sang and\r\namused the company.\r\n\r\nShut up within the castle walls, it seemed as if the lord and his\r\npeople would be absolutely safe against any attacks of his enemies. In\r\nthe first place, any enemy would have had to cross the moat or ditch\r\nwhich surrounded the castle. Across this moat there was a drawbridge\r\nto the entrance or gate of the castle. In the entrance itself was an\r\niron gate called a portcullis, which was usually raised like a window\r\nto allow people to pass. In time of war the drawbridge was raised. But\r\nin case an enemy was seen approaching and there was no time to raise\r\nthe drawbridge, this portcullis could be dropped at a moment’s notice.\r\nWhen the drawbridge was raised there was no way of getting into the\r\ncastle except by crossing the moat filled with water. Any one trying\r\nto do this would have had stones or melted tar thrown down on him.\r\nInstead of windows in the wall of the castle there were only long slits\r\nthrough which the fighters could shoot arrows at the enemy. At the same\r\ntime, it was very difficult for any one on the outside to hit the small\r\ncrack-like opening with an arrow.\r\n\r\nAnd yet attacks _were_ made on castles. Sometimes the enemy built a\r\ntall wooden tower on wheels. This they would roll up as closely as they\r\ncould get to the walls, and from its top shoot directly over into the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nSometimes they built tunnels from the outside right under the ground,\r\nunder the moat, and under the castle walls into the castle itself.\r\n\r\nSometimes they built huge machines called battering-rams, and with\r\nthese they battered down the walls.\r\n\r\nSometimes they used machines like great slingshots to throw stones over\r\nthe walls. Of course there were no cannons nor cannon-balls nor guns\r\nnor gunpowder then.\r\n\r\nThe lord and his family were the society people; all the others were\r\nlittle better than slaves. In times of peace most of the common people\r\nlived outside the castle walls on the land called the _manor_. The\r\nlord gave them just as little as he could and took from them just as\r\nmuch as he could. He had to feed and take some care of them so that\r\nthey could fight for him and serve him, just as he had to feed and take\r\ncare of his horses that carried him to battle, and the cattle that\r\nprovided him with milk and meat. But he didn’t treat them as well as\r\nhe did his domestic animals. The common people had to give their time\r\nand labor and a large part of the crops they raised to the lord. They\r\nthemselves lived in miserable huts more like cow-sheds, with only one\r\nroom, and that had a dirt floor. Above this was perhaps a loft reached\r\nby a ladder where they went to bed. But bed was usually only a bundle\r\nof straw, and they slept in the clothes they wore during the day.\r\n\r\nThese work-people were called serfs. Sometimes a serf could stand this\r\nkind of life no longer, and he would run away. If he was not caught\r\nwithin a year and a day, he was a free man. But if he was caught before\r\nthe year and a day were up, the lord might whip him, brand him with\r\nhot irons, or even cut off his hands. Indeed, a lord could do almost\r\nanything he wished with his serfs--except kill them, or sell them.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think of the Feudal System?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\nKnights and Days of Chivalry\r\n\r\n\r\nThose _years_ in history which I have been telling you about are\r\nknown as the _days_ of chivalry--which means the times of ladies and\r\ngentlemen. The lord and his family were the gentlemen and the ladies.\r\nAll the other people, by far the greater number, were just common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere were no schools for these common people. Little was done for\r\nthem. They were taught to work and nothing else. The sons of a lord\r\nof a castle, however, were very carefully taught. But even they were\r\ntaught only two things, how to be gentlemen and how to fight. Reading\r\nand writing were thought of no importance; in fact, it was usually\r\nconsidered a waste of time to learn such things.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the way the son of a lord was brought up. He stayed with\r\nhis mother until he was seven years old. When he reached the age of\r\nseven he was called a page; and for the next seven years--that is,\r\nuntil he was fourteen, he remained a page. During the time he was a\r\npage his chief business was to wait on the ladies of the castle. He\r\nran their errands, carried their messages, waited on table, etc. He\r\nalso learned to ride a horse and to be brave and courteous.\r\n\r\nWhen he was fourteen years old he became a squire and remained a squire\r\nfor the next seven years; that is, until he was twenty-one. During\r\nthe time he was a squire he waited on the men, as he had waited on\r\nthe ladies when he was a page. He attended to the men’s horses, went\r\nto battle with them, led an extra horse, and carried another spear or\r\nlance, in case these should be needed.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-one years old, if he had been a good squire and\r\nhad learned the lessons that he was taught, he then became a knight.\r\nBecoming a knight was an important ceremony like graduating exercises,\r\nfor the grown boy was now to take up the business of a man.\r\n\r\nTo get ready for this ceremony, first, he bathed. This may not seem\r\nworth mentioning, but in those days one very rarely took a bath,\r\nsometimes not for years. He was then dressed in new clothes. Thus\r\nwashed and dressed, he prayed all night long in the church. When day\r\ncame he appeared before all the people and solemnly swore always to do\r\nand to be certain things:\r\n\r\n  To be brave and good;\r\n  To fight for the Christian religion;\r\n  To protect the weak;\r\n  To honor women.\r\n\r\nThese were his vows. A white leather belt was then put on him and gold\r\nspurs fastened on his boots. After this had been done he knelt, and\r\nhis lord struck him over the shoulders with the flat side of a sword,\r\nsaying as he did so, “I dub thee knight.”\r\n\r\nA knight went into battle covered with a suit of armor made of iron\r\nrings or steel plates like fish-scales, and with a helmet or hood of\r\niron. This suit protected him from the arrows and lances of the enemy.\r\nOf course if they had had any shot or shell, armor would have been no\r\nuse at all, but they had no such things then.\r\n\r\nKnights were so completely covered by their armor that when sides\r\nbecame mixed up in fighting, they could not tell one another apart. It\r\nwas impossible to know which were friends and which were enemies.\r\n\r\nSo the knights wore, on the outside of the coat that went over their\r\narmor, a design of an animal, such as a lion, or of a plant or a rose\r\nor a cross or some ornament, and this design was known as a coat of\r\narms. Perhaps your father may use a coat of arms on his letter-paper\r\nto-day, and if so he has inherited it from some great-great-grandparent\r\nwho was a knight.\r\n\r\nA knight, as I told you, was first of all taught to be a gentleman,\r\nand so we still speak of one who has good manners and is courteous,\r\nespecially to ladies, as knightly or chivalrous. When a knight came\r\ninto the presence of a lady he took off his helmet. It meant, “You are\r\nmy friend, and so I do not need my helmet.” That is why gentlemen raise\r\ntheir hats nowadays when they meet ladies.\r\n\r\nBut the most important thing the knights had to learn was to fight.\r\nEven their games were play fights.\r\n\r\nEach country and each age has had its own games or sports in which it\r\nhas taken special delight. The Greeks had their Olympic Games. The\r\nRomans had their chariot-races and gladiatorial contests. We have\r\nfootball and baseball. But the chief sport of the knights was a kind of\r\nsham battle called the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe tournament was held in a field known as the _lists_. Large crowds\r\nwith banners flying and trumpets blowing would gather around the lists\r\nto watch the sham fight, as crowds nowadays flock to a big football\r\ngame waving pennants and tooting horns. The knights on horseback took\r\ntheir places at opposite ends of the lists. They carried lances, the\r\npoints of which were covered so that they would not make a wound. At\r\na given signal, they rushed toward the center of the field and tried\r\nwith their lances to throw each other off their horses. The winner who\r\nsucceeded in throwing the other knights was presented with a ribbon\r\nor a keepsake by one of the ladies, and a knight thought as much of\r\nthis trophy of victory as the winner of a cup in a tennis tournament\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady with falcon.]\r\n\r\nKnights were very fond of hunting with dogs. But they also hunted with\r\na trained bird called a falcon, and both lords and ladies delighted\r\nin this sport. The falcon was trained like a hunting-dog to catch\r\nother birds, such as wild ducks and pigeons and also small animals.\r\nThe falcon was chained to the wrist of the lord or lady, and its head\r\nwas covered with a hood as it was carried out to hunt. When a bird was\r\nseen the hood was removed, and the falcon, which was very swift, would\r\nswoop upon its prey and capture it. Thereupon the hunter would come\r\nup, take the captured animal, and put the hood on the falcon again.\r\nThe men, however, usually preferred hunting the wild boar, which was a\r\nkind of pig with sharp tusks, for this was more dangerous and therefore\r\nsupposed to be more of a man’s sport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\nA Pirate’s _Great_ Grandson\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alfred was king the Danes had raided England.\r\n\r\nAt the same time their cousins the Norsemen had raided the coast of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nKing Alfred at last had to give the Danes a part of the English coast,\r\nand they then settled down and became Christians.\r\n\r\nThe French king likewise did the same thing. In order to save himself\r\nfrom further raids, he gave the Norsemen a part of the French coast.\r\nThen the Norsemen, as the Danes had done, settled down and became\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nThese Norsemen who raided France were led by a very bold and brave\r\npirate named Rollo. In return for this gift of land Rollo was supposed\r\nto do homage by kissing the king’s foot. But Rollo thought it beneath\r\nhim to kneel and kiss the king’s foot, so he told one of his men to do\r\nit for him. His man did as he was told, but he didn’t like to do it,\r\neither, and so as he kissed the king’s foot he raised it so high that\r\nhe tipped his Majesty over backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThat part of France which was given the Norsemen came to be called\r\nNormandy, and it is so called to-day, and the people were known\r\nthereafter as Normans.\r\n\r\nIn 1066 there was a very powerful duke ruling over Normandy. His name\r\nwas William, and he was descended from Rollo the pirate. Perhaps your\r\nname may be William. Perhaps you may even be descended from this\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nWilliam was strong in body, strong in will, and strong in rule over\r\nhis people. He could shoot an arrow farther, straighter, and with more\r\ndeadly effect than any of his knights. No one else was strong enough\r\neven to bend the bow he used.\r\n\r\nWilliam and his people had become Christians, but according to their\r\nidea the Christian God was more like their old god Woden under a new\r\nname. William believed that “might made right,” for he was descended\r\nfrom a pirate, and he still thought and acted like a pirate. So\r\nwhatever he wanted he went after and took, even though he was supposed\r\nto be a Christian.\r\n\r\nNow, William was only a duke, not a king, and he wanted to be a king.\r\nIn fact, he thought he would like to be king of England, which was just\r\nacross the channel from his own dukedom.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a young English prince named Harold was shipwrecked\r\non the coast of Normandy and was found and brought before William.\r\nNow, it seemed likely that some day Harold would be king of England,\r\nand William thought this a good chance to get England for himself. So\r\nbefore he would let Harold leave, he made the young man promise that\r\nwhen his turn came to be king he would give him England just as if that\r\ncountry were a horse or a suit of armor that could be given away. Then,\r\nin order that this promise should be solemnly binding, William made\r\nHarold place his hand on the altar and swear, just as people place a\r\nhand on the Bible nowadays, when they take an oath. After Harold had\r\nsworn on the altar, William had the top lifted and showed Harold that\r\nbelow it were the bones of some of the Christian saints. Swearing on\r\nthe bones of a saint was the most solemn kind of an oath one could\r\npossibly take. It was thought one would not dare to break such an oath\r\nfor fear of the wrath of God.\r\n\r\nThen Harold returned to England. But when the time came that he should\r\nbe king the people naturally would not let him give England to William.\r\nBesides that, Harold said that such an oath, which he had taken against\r\nhis will, an oath which had been forced on him by a trick, was not\r\nbinding. So Harold became king.\r\n\r\nWhen William heard that Harold had been made king, he was very angry.\r\nHe said that he had been cheated and that Harold had broken his oath.\r\nSo at once he got ready an army and sailed over to take the country\r\naway from Harold.\r\n\r\nAs William landed from his boat he stumbled and fell headlong on the\r\nshore. All his soldiers were shocked and greatly worried by this, for\r\nthey thought it very bad luck--a bad omen, the Greeks would have called\r\nit. But William was quick-witted, and as he fell he grabbed up some of\r\nthe earth in both hands. Then, rising, he made believe he had fallen on\r\npurpose and, lifting his hands in the air, exclaimed that he had taken\r\nup the ground as a sign that he was going to have _all_ the land of\r\nEngland. This changed the bad omen into good luck.\r\n\r\nThe battle started, and the English fought furiously to defend\r\nthemselves against these foreigners who were trying to take their\r\ncountry away from them. Indeed, they had almost won the battle when\r\nWilliam gave an order to his men to pretend they were running away.\r\nThe English then followed, wildly rejoicing, and running pell-mell\r\nafter the Normans. Just as soon, however, as the English were scattered\r\nand in disorder, William gave another signal, and his men faced about\r\nquickly. The English were taken by surprise, and before they could get\r\ninto fighting order again, they were defeated, and Harold, their king,\r\nwas shot through the eye and killed. This was the battle of Hastings,\r\none of the most famous battles in English History.\r\n\r\nHarold had put up a brave fight. But luck was against him. Only a few\r\ndays before this, he had had to fight a battle with his own brother,\r\nwho in a traitorous way had got together an army against him. We are\r\nsorry for Harold, and yet it was probably better for England that\r\nthings turned out as they did--yet who can tell?\r\n\r\nWilliam marched on to London and had himself crowned king on Christmas\r\nday, 1066. Ever since then he has been known as William the Conqueror,\r\nand the event is called the Norman Conquest. After this England had a\r\nnew line of kings--a Norman family and a pirate family--to rule over\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWilliam divided England up among his nobles as if it were a pie, and\r\ngave each a share in the feudal way. They had to do homage to him as\r\nhis vassals and promise to fight for him and to do as he said. Each of\r\nWilliam’s nobles built a castle on the property he was given. William\r\nhimself built a castle in London by the Thames River. On the same spot\r\nJulius Cæsar had built a fort, but it had disappeared; and Alfred the\r\nGreat had built a castle there, but it, too, had disappeared. But the\r\ncastle William built is still standing to-day. It is known as the Tower\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nWilliam was a splendid boss and very businesslike. He set to work and\r\nhad a list made of all the land in England, a list of all the people\r\nand of all the property they had. This record was called the Domesday\r\nBook and was something like the _census_ now taken in this country\r\nevery ten years. This list gave the name of every one in England and\r\neverything each owned, even down to the last cow and pig. If your\r\nancestors were living in England then you can look in the Domesday Book\r\nand find their names, how much land they owned, and how many cows and\r\npigs they had.\r\n\r\nIn order that no mischief might take place at night, William started\r\nwhat was called the _curfew_. Every evening at a certain hour a bell\r\nwas rung. Then all lights had to be put out, and every one had to go\r\nindoors--supposedly to bed.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, that William did made the English very angry. He\r\nwas extremely fond of hunting, but there was no good place where he\r\ncould hunt near London. So in order to have a place for hunting, he\r\ndestroyed a large number of village houses and farms and turned that\r\npart of the country into a forest. This was called the New Forest, and\r\nthough it is now nearly nine hundred years _old_ it is still called New\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, William, although descended from a pirate, gave\r\nEngland a good government and made it a much safer and better place in\r\nwhich to live than it ever had been under its former rulers. So 1066\r\nwas almost like the Year 1 for the English.\r\n\r\nWe think it is remarkable when children of low-bred immigrants\r\nbecome society leaders, when, as we say, they rise from overalls to\r\ndress-suits, but here we have the son’s son of a pirate rising to be\r\nking of England, and those living now who find they are descended from\r\nhim brag of it!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\nA Great Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever played the game called “Going to Jerusalem” in which\r\nevery one scrambles to get a seat when the music stops playing?\r\n\r\nWell, all during the Dark Ages “Going to Jerusalem” was not a game but\r\na real journey which Christians everywhere in Europe wanted to take and\r\ndid take if they could. They wanted to see the actual spot where Christ\r\nhad been crucified, to pray at the Holy Sepulcher, and to bring back a\r\npalm-leaf as a souvenir, which they could show their friends, hang on\r\nthe wall, and talk about all the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nSo there were always some good Christians--and also some bad\r\nones--“going to Jerusalem.” Sometimes they went all by themselves,\r\nbut more often they went with others. As of course there were no such\r\nthings as trains in those days, poor people had to walk nearly the\r\nwhole way from France and from England, from Spain and from Germany,\r\nand so it took them many months and sometimes years to reach Jerusalem.\r\nThese travelers were called _pilgrims_, and their trip was called a\r\n_pilgrimage_.\r\n\r\nJerusalem at that time belonged to the Turks, who were Mohammedans. The\r\nTurks did not like these Christian pilgrims who came to see Christ’s\r\ntomb, and they didn’t treat them very well. Indeed, some of the\r\npilgrims on their return told frightful stories of the way they had\r\nbeen treated by the Turks and the way the holy places in Jerusalem were\r\nalso treated.\r\n\r\nJust before the Year 1100 there was a pope at Rome named Urban. He\r\nwas the head of all the Christians in the world. Urban heard these\r\ntales that the pilgrims told, and he was shocked. He thought it was a\r\nterrible thing, anyway, for the Holy City, as Jerusalem was called,\r\nand the Holy Land, where Jerusalem was located, to be ruled over by\r\nMohammedans instead of by Christians. So Urban made a speech and urged\r\nall good Christians everywhere to get together and go on a pilgrimage\r\nto the Holy Land, with the idea of fighting the Turks and taking the\r\ncity of Jerusalem away from them.\r\n\r\nNow, there lived at that same time a monk whom people called Peter the\r\nHermit. A hermit is a man who goes off and lives entirely by himself,\r\nusually in a cave or hut where no one can find him or go to see him,\r\nwhere he can spend all day in prayer. Peter the Hermit thought such a\r\nlife was good for his soul, that it made him a better man to be hungry\r\nand cold and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nPeter the Hermit had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and was very angry\r\nat what he saw there. So he, too, began to tell people everywhere he\r\nwent how disgraceful it was for them to allow Christ’s tomb to belong\r\nto the Mohammedans and called on every one to start on a pilgrimage\r\nwith him to save Jerusalem. He talked to people in the churches, on the\r\nstreet-corners, in the market-places, on the roadside. He was such a\r\nwonderful orator that those who heard him wept at his descriptions and\r\nbegged to go with him.\r\n\r\nBefore long, thousands upon thousands of people, old and young, men and\r\nwomen, and even some children had pledged themselves to join a band to\r\ngo to Jerusalem and take it away from the Mohammedans. As Christ had\r\ndied on the cross, they cut pieces of red cloth in the form of a cross\r\nand sewed them on the fronts of their coats as a sign that they were\r\nsoldiers of the cross. So these pilgrims were called _Crusaders_, which\r\nis the Latin word for a cross-bearer. As they knew they would be gone\r\na long time and perhaps never return, they sold all they had and left\r\ntheir homes. Not only poor people but lords and nobles and even princes\r\njoined the army of the Crusaders, and there were, besides the crowds on\r\nfoot, large companies of those who rode on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to start in the summer of 1096, four years before 1100,\r\nbut a great many were so anxious to get started that they didn’t wait\r\nfor the time that had been set. With Peter the Hermit and another pious\r\nman named Walter the Penniless as their leaders, they started off\r\nbefore things were really ready.\r\n\r\nThey had no idea how very far off Jerusalem was. They hadn’t studied\r\ngeography nor maps. They had no idea how long it would take, no idea\r\nhow they would get food to eat on their journey, no idea where they\r\nwould sleep. They simply trusted in Peter the Hermit and believed that\r\nthe Lord would provide everything and show them the way.\r\n\r\nOnward they marched, “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” thousands upon\r\nthousands, toward the east and far-off Jerusalem. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of them died from disease and from hunger on the way. Every\r\ntime they came within sight of another city, they would ask, “Is this\r\nJerusalem?” so little did they know of the long distance that still lay\r\nbetween them and that city.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mohammedan army in Jerusalem heard that the Crusaders were\r\ncoming they went forth to meet the Christians and killed almost all\r\nof those who had started out with Peter ahead of the rest. But those\r\nCrusaders that had started out later, as had been planned at the\r\nbeginning, marched on.\r\n\r\nFinally, after nearly four years, only a small band of that vast throng\r\nthat had set out so long before reached the walls of the Holy City.\r\nWhen at last they saw Jerusalem before them, they were wild with joy.\r\nThey fell on their knees and wept and prayed and sang hymns and thanked\r\nGod that he had brought them to the end of their journey. Then they\r\nfuriously attacked the city. The Christians fought so terribly that\r\nat last they beat the Mohammedans and captured Jerusalem. Then they\r\nentered the gates and killed thousands, so that it is said the streets\r\nof the Holy City ran with blood. This seems strange behavior for the\r\nfollowers of Christ, who preached against fighting and commanded, “Put\r\nup thy sword, for he that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword.”\r\n\r\nThe Crusaders then made one of their leaders named Godfrey ruler of the\r\ncity. Most of the other Crusaders that were left then went back home.\r\nSo ended what is known as the First Crusade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\nTit-Tat-To; Three Kings in a Row\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here are three kings:\r\n  Richard of England,\r\n  Philip of France, and\r\n  Frederick Barbarossa of Germany.\r\n\r\nIf you say their names over several times, they keep ringing through\r\nyour mind and you cannot seem to stop thinking them whether you want to\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nJerusalem was captured. But it did not stay captured very long.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans attacked and won it back again.\r\n\r\nSo the Christians started a Second Crusade. Then about once in a\r\nlifetime during the next two hundred years there was one Crusade after\r\nanother--eight or nine in all. Sometimes these later Crusades won back\r\nJerusalem for a while, but for a while only. Sometimes they did not\r\nsucceed at all.\r\n\r\nThe Third Crusade took place about a hundred years after the First;\r\nthat is, nearly 1200 A. D. These three kings--Richard of England,\r\nPhilip of France, and Frederick Barbarossa--started on the Third\r\nCrusade. But they didn’t all finish. I will tell you about them in\r\nthree-two-one order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Richard of England, Philip of France, and Frederick\r\nBarbarossa]\r\n\r\nFrederick’s name, Barbarossa, meant Red Beard, for in those days it was\r\nthe custom to give kings nicknames that described them. Frederick’s\r\ncapital was in Aix-la-Chapelle, as Charlemagne’s had been, but\r\nFrederick was king only of Germany. When a young man he had tried to\r\nmake his country as large and powerful as the new Roman Empire that\r\nCharlemagne had made. But he was not a great enough man, and so was\r\nunable to do what Charlemagne had done. Frederick was quite old when\r\nhe started out on the Third Crusade with the other two kings. But he\r\nnever reached Jerusalem, for in crossing a stream on the way he was\r\ndrowned. So much for Frederick, the third king.\r\n\r\nThe second king, Philip of France, was jealous of the first king,\r\nRichard, because Richard was so very popular and well liked by the\r\nCrusaders. So Philip finally gave up the Crusade and went back to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nRichard of England was then the only king left on the Crusade. It would\r\nhave been better if he, too, had gone back to his country instead of\r\ngallivanting off on a Crusade. But he thought going on a Crusade was\r\nmuch better sport than staying at home and working over the difficult\r\nbusiness of governing his people.\r\n\r\nBut although he had his faults, Richard was the kind of a man that\r\nall men like and all women love. He was kind and gentle, yet strong\r\nand brave. Richard the Lion-Hearted they called him. He was hard on\r\nwrongdoers but fair and square. So people loved him, but they feared\r\nhim, too, for he punished the wicked and those who misbehaved. Even\r\nlong, long after he had died, mothers would try to quiet a naughty and\r\ncrying child by saying: “Hush! If you don’t be good, King Richard will\r\nget you!”\r\n\r\n  soHnOFFGOBBELLum!\r\n\r\nEven Richard’s enemies admired him. The Mohammedan king of Jerusalem at\r\nthe time of this Third Crusade was named Saladin. Saladin, though being\r\nattacked by Richard, admired him very much and even became his friend.\r\nAnd so Saladin, instead of fighting Richard, finally made a friendly\r\nagreement with him to treat the Holy Sepulcher and the pilgrims\r\nproperly. As this arrangement was satisfactory to every one, Richard\r\nleft Jerusalem to Saladin and started back home.\r\n\r\nOn his way home Richard was captured by one of his enemies and put in\r\nprison and held for a large ransom from England. Richard’s friends did\r\nnot know where he was and did not know how to find him.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that Richard had a favorite minstrel named Blondel.\r\nBlondel had composed a song of which Richard was very fond. So when\r\nRichard was taken prisoner, Blondel wandered over the country singing\r\neverywhere this favorite song in the hope that Richard might hear it\r\nand reveal where he was. One day he happened to sing beneath the very\r\ntower where Richard was imprisoned. Richard heard him and answered by\r\nsinging the refrain of the song. His friends then knew where he was,\r\nthe ransom was paid, and Richard was allowed to go free.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, Richard did reach England, he still had adventures. This\r\nwas the time when Robin Hood was robbing travelers. Richard planned\r\nto have himself taken prisoner by Robin Hood, so that he might capture\r\nhim and bring him to justice. So Richard disguised himself as a monk\r\nand was captured as he had planned. But he found Robin Hood such a good\r\nfellow after all that he forgave him and his men.\r\n\r\nRichard’s coat of arms was a design of three lions, one above the\r\nother; and this same design of three lions now forms part of the shield\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAfter Richard’s Crusade there was a Fourth Crusade, and then in the\r\nyear 1212--which is an easy date to remember, because it is simply the\r\nnumber 12 repeated--one, two, one, two--there was a crusade of children\r\nonly. This was known therefore as the Children’s Crusade. It was led by\r\na French boy about twelve years old named Stephen, who was named after\r\nthe first Christian martyr.\r\n\r\nChildren from all over France left their homes and their mothers and\r\nfathers--it seems strange to us that their mothers and fathers let them\r\nstart off on such a trip--and marched south to the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nHere they expected the waters of the sea would part and allow them\r\nto march on dry land to Jerusalem, as they had read in the Bible the\r\nwaters of the Red Sea had done to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt.\r\nBut the waters did not part.\r\n\r\nSome sailors, however, offered to take the children to Jerusalem in\r\ntheir ships. They said they would do it for nothing, just for the love\r\nof the Lord. But it turned out that these sailors were really pirates,\r\nand as soon as they got the children on board their ships they steered\r\nthem straight across the Mediterranean to Africa into the very land of\r\ntheir enemies, the Mohammedans. Here, it is said, the pirates sold the\r\nchildren as slaves. This is not a Grimm’s Fairy-Tale, and the pirates\r\nwere not trapped by the children, so I cannot make a happy ending, for\r\nit was not.\r\n\r\nThe last or Eighth Crusade was led by a king of France called Louis. He\r\nwas so pious and so devoted to the Lord that he was made a saint and\r\never after has been called St. Louis. Yet this Crusade failed, and ever\r\nsince Jerusalem has been ruled by the Mohammedans until just recently,\r\nwhen, in 1918, it was captured by the English, and this, then, was\r\nreally the Last Crusade.\r\n\r\nNot all the Crusaders were good Christians. Like some people nowadays,\r\na great many were Christian only in name. In fact, though strange\r\nto say, quite a number of the Crusaders were nothing but scalawags,\r\nlooking for excitement and adventure, and they went on a Crusade merely\r\nas an excuse to rob and plunder.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades did not succeed in their object, which was to keep\r\nJerusalem for the Christians. Yet in spite of that, they did a great\r\ndeal of good. When the Crusades first started, the Crusaders were not\r\nnearly as civilized as the people they went to conquer. But travel\r\nsometimes teaches people more than books, and it taught the Crusaders.\r\nThey learned the customs of the other lands through which they went.\r\nThey learned languages and literature. They learned history and art.\r\n\r\nThere were then no public schools. Only a very, very few people had any\r\neducation at all. So the Crusades did what schools might have done.\r\nThey taught the people of Europe and put an end to the Dark Ages of\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\nBibles Made of Stone and Glass\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often do you go to church?\r\n\r\nProbably not more than once a week--on Sundays.\r\n\r\nBut in the Middle Ages people usually went to church every day and\r\noften several times a day. They did not go only when there was a church\r\nservice. They went to say their prayers by themselves; they went to\r\ntell their troubles to the priest, to get advice from him, to burn a\r\ncandle to the Virgin Mary, or simply to chat with their friends.\r\n\r\nAll during the Crusades, and immediately after the Crusades, the chief\r\nthing that people thought about was their church.\r\n\r\nThere was only one church in a neighborhood, and every one went to\r\nthe same church for there were no Baptists, nor Episcopalians, nor\r\nMethodists; all were just Christians.\r\n\r\nThe church was every one’s meeting-house, and so people naturally gave\r\nas much money and time and labor as they could to make their church\r\nthe best that could be built. That is why there were built in France\r\nand other parts of Europe at this time many of the finest churches\r\nand cathedrals in the world. These churches and cathedrals are still\r\nstanding, and, because they are so beautiful, people go long distances\r\nto see them.\r\n\r\nDo you know what a cathedral is? A cathedral is not just a large\r\nchurch. It is the church of a bishop. In the chancel of this church\r\nthere is a special chair for the bishop. This bishop’s chair is called\r\nin Latin a “cathedra,” and so his church is named a cathedral after\r\nthis chair.\r\n\r\nThese churches and cathedrals were nothing like the old Greek and Roman\r\ntemples; they were not like anything that had ever been built before.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever built a house out of blocks, you probably did it this\r\nway: first you stood two blocks upright, and then you laid another\r\nblock across the top of these for a roof. This is the way the Greeks\r\nand Romans built.\r\n\r\nBut the Christians throughout Europe at that time did not build in this\r\nway at all.\r\n\r\nWhen you were building toy-houses, instead of laying a single block\r\nacross the two standing ones, you may perhaps have tried leaning two\r\nblocks together like the sides of a letter A for a roof? If you did,\r\nyou know what happened: the two leaning blocks pushed over the sides,\r\nand _crash_! everything tumbled. Well, these churches were built\r\nsomewhat in this way, with stones arched across the standing stone\r\ncolumns. But to keep the stone arches from pushing over the standing\r\nstone columns the builders put up props or braces. These props or\r\nbraces were made of stone, too, and these props of stone were called\r\n_flying buttresses_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flying buttresses--Apse of Notre Dame.]\r\n\r\nThe people in Italy thought this a crazy way of building. They thought\r\nsuch buildings must be shaky and might easily topple over--like a\r\nhouse of cards. The Goths who had conquered Italy in 476 were wild\r\nand ignorant and after that people called anything wild and ignorant\r\n“Gothic.” So people called all buildings such as I have just described\r\n“Gothic,” although the Goths had nothing to do with the buildings, for\r\nthey had all died long years before.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from my description you, too, may think such buildings propped\r\nup by flying buttresses must have been tottering and ugly, but they\r\nwere neither. They were not rickety, for though occasionally one that\r\nwas not carefully built did collapse, the largest and best are still\r\nstanding to-day. And although there were old-fashioned people who\r\nthought no building was beautiful that was not built in the Roman or\r\nGreek style, we have come to admire the great beauty of these so called\r\nGothic buildings.\r\n\r\nBut there were other ways in which the Gothic churches were different\r\nfrom the Greek and Roman temples. Before a Gothic church was started,\r\na very large cross was first drawn on the ground with its head\r\ntowards the east, because that is the direction of Jerusalem. On this\r\ncross-shaped plan, the church was built so that if you looked down from\r\nabove on the finished building, it was shaped like a cross with the\r\naltar always toward the east.\r\n\r\nGothic churches had beautiful spires or _arrows_, which have been\r\nlikened to _fingers pointing to_ _heaven_. The doorways and windows\r\nwere not square or round at the top, but pointed, like hands placed\r\ntogether in prayer.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole side of a Gothic church was made of glass. These large\r\nwindows were not, however, plain white glass, but beautiful pictures\r\nmade of colored glass. Small pieces of different colors were joined\r\ntogether at their edges with lead to make what looked like wonderful\r\npaintings. But these pictures were much finer than ordinary paintings,\r\nfor the light shone through the stained glass and made the colors\r\nbrilliant as jewels--blue like the clear sky, yellow like sunlight, red\r\nlike a ruby. These pictures in glass told stories from the Bible. They\r\nwere like colored illustrations in a book. So the people who could not\r\nread, and very few could read, were able to know the Bible stories just\r\nby looking at these beautiful illustrations.\r\n\r\nStatues of saints and angels and characters in the Bible were carved in\r\nthe stonework of the church. So the churches were like Bibles of stone\r\nand glass.\r\n\r\nBesides these holy beings, strange, grotesque beasts were also made in\r\nstone--monsters like no animal that has ever been seen in nature. These\r\ncreatures were usually put on the outside edge or corner of the roof\r\nor they were used for waterspouts and called _gargoyles_. They were\r\nsupposed to scare away evil spirits from the holy place.\r\n\r\nNo one now knows who were the architects or the builders of these\r\nGothic churches or who were the sculptors or artists. Almost every one\r\ndid some work on the church, for it was _his_ church. Instead of giving\r\nmoney he gave his time and labor. If he had any skill, he carved stone\r\nor made stained glass. If he had no skill he did the work of a common\r\nlaborer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gargoyle.]\r\n\r\nSome of these Gothic churches took hundreds of years to build, so that\r\nthe workmen who started them never lived to see them finished. Some of\r\nthe most famous cathedrals are Canterbury Cathedral in England, the\r\nCathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, and Cologne Cathedral in Germany.\r\n\r\nCologne Cathedral took the longest of all to build, as it was not\r\nentirely finished until about seven hundred years after it was begun!\r\nThe beautiful Cathedral of Rheims in France was almost destroyed by the\r\ngun-fire of the Germans in the Great War only a few years ago.\r\n\r\nGothic churches were built, with loving care, of stone and jeweled\r\nglass. Nothing but the best was thought good enough. To-day almost all\r\nchurches are still built with spires, pointed doors and some stained\r\nglass windows, and often the altar is toward the east. But although\r\nthey imitate the Gothic style in these things, they seldom have stone\r\nceilings, as Gothic churches had, nor flying buttresses, nor walls of\r\nstained glass. The ceilings are usually of wood, the spire often of\r\nwood, also, and even the whole building of wood or some cheap material.\r\nReal Gothic was enormously expensive and difficult, and nowadays people\r\nhaven’t the time, the money, nor the interest to build in such a way.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the story of Gothic churches that the Goths had nothing to\r\ndo with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\nJohn, Whom Nobody Loved\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard, the Lion-Hearted, whom everybody loved, had a brother named\r\nJohn, whom nobody loved.\r\n\r\nThis brother John became king, but he turned out to be a very wicked\r\nking.\r\n\r\nHe is another one of the villains in history, whom we do not like, but\r\nlike to hear about, and like to clap when he gets what he deserves.\r\n\r\nJohn was afraid that his young nephew named Arthur might be made king\r\nin his place, and so he had him murdered. Some say he hired others to\r\ndo the killing; some say he murdered him with his own hands. This was\r\na very bad beginning for his reign, but things got worse and worse as\r\ntime went on.\r\n\r\nJohn got into a quarrel with the pope in Rome. The pope at that time\r\nwas head of all Christians in the world and said what should be done\r\nand what should not be done in all churches everywhere. The pope\r\nordered John to make a certain man bishop in England, and John said he\r\nwouldn’t do it. He wanted another man, a friend of his, to be bishop.\r\nThe pope then said he would close up all the churches in England if\r\nJohn didn’t do as he was told. John said he didn’t care. Let the pope\r\ngo ahead and close up all the churches if he wanted to. So the pope\r\nordered all churches in England to be closed until John should give\r\nin. Nowadays this might not have made much difference, but then, as I\r\nhave told you, the church was the one most important thing in every\r\none’s life; in fact, nothing else mattered so much. The closing of\r\nthe churches meant that no services could be held in any church. It\r\nmeant that children could not be baptized, and so, if they died, it\r\nwas believed they could not go to heaven. It meant that couples could\r\nnot be married. It meant that the dead could not be given a Christian\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nThe people of England were shocked. It was as if Heaven had put a curse\r\non them. They were afraid that terrible things would happen to them. Of\r\ncourse the people blamed John, for he was the cause of the churches’\r\nbeing closed. They were so angry at him that he became scared--afraid\r\nwhat his people might do to him. When at last the pope threatened to\r\nmake another man king of England in his place--yes, the pope had as\r\nmuch power as that--John in fear and trembling gave in and agreed to\r\ndo everything that at first he had said he would not do and more\r\nbesides. But John was pig-headed. He was always doing the wrong thing\r\nand sticking to it.\r\n\r\nJohn had an idea that the world was made for the king and that people\r\nwere put upon the earth simply so that the king might have servants to\r\nwork for him, to earn money for him, to do what he wished them to do.\r\nMany of the kings of olden days felt the same way, though they did not\r\ngo as far as John did. John would order people who were rich to give\r\nhim whatever money he wanted. If they refused to give him all he asked,\r\nhe would put them in prison, have their hands squeezed in an iron press\r\nuntil the bones cracked and the blood ran, or he would even put them to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nJohn got worse and worse until at last his barons could not stand his\r\nactions any longer. So they made him prisoner and took him to a little\r\nisland in the Thames River called Runnymede. Here they forced John to\r\nagree to certain things which they had written down in Latin. This was\r\nin the Year 1215; and 1215 was a bad date for John, but a good date\r\nfor the English people. This list of things which the barons made John\r\nagree to was called by the Latin name for a great agreement, which is\r\nMagna Carta, or Charta.\r\n\r\nJohn did not agree to Magna Carta willingly, however. He was as angry\r\nand furious as a spoiled child, who kicks and screams when forced to do\r\nsomething he does not want to do. But he had to agree, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nJohn was unable to write his name, and so he could not sign the\r\nagreement as people sign contracts nowadays. But he wore a seal-ring\r\nwhich was used by people who could not sign their names, and this seal\r\nhe pressed into a piece of hot wax which was dropped on the agreement\r\nwhere one would have signed.\r\n\r\nJohn agreed in Magna Carta to give the barons some of the rights that\r\nwe think every human being should have anyway, without an agreement.\r\nFor instance, a person certainly has the right to keep the money that\r\nhe earns, and he has the right not to have it taken away from him\r\nunlawfully. A person also has the right not to be put in prison or be\r\npunished by the king or any one else unless he has done something wrong\r\nand unless he has had a fair trial. These are two of the rights that\r\nJohn agreed to in Magna Carta. There were quite a number of others.\r\n\r\nJohn didn’t keep his agreement, however. He broke it the very first\r\ntime he had a good chance, as a person usually does when he is forced\r\nto agree to something against his will. But John died pretty soon; and\r\nso, as far as he was concerned, Magna Carta didn’t matter much. But\r\nkings who came after him were made to agree to the same things. So ever\r\nafter 1215 the king in England was supposed to be the servant of the\r\npeople, and not the people servants of the king as they had been before\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\nA Great Story-Teller\r\n\r\n\r\nFar away from England,\r\n\r\nFar off in the direction of the rising sun,\r\n\r\n’Way beyond Italy and Jerusalem and the Tigris and Euphrates and Persia\r\nand all the other places we have so far heard about, was a country\r\ncalled Cathay--C-A-T-H-A-Y.\r\n\r\nIf you looked down at your feet, and the world were glass, you would\r\nsee it on the other side.\r\n\r\nCathay is the same place we now call China. The people in Cathay\r\nbelonged to the yellow race, the same race to which the Chinese belong.\r\n\r\nThere had been people living in Cathay, of course, all through the\r\ncenturies that had passed, but little was known of this land or of its\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut in the thirteenth century or twelve hundreds, one of these tribes\r\nof yellow people called Mongols or Tartars, arose out of the East, like\r\na black and terrifying thunderstorm, and it seemed for a while as if\r\nthey might destroy all the other countries whose histories we have been\r\nhearing about. The ruler of these people was a terrible fighter named\r\nGenghis Khan. Genghis Khan had an army of Tartar horsemen who were\r\nterrific fighters. Genghis and his Tartars were a good deal like Attila\r\nand his Huns--only worse. Indeed, some people think Attila and his Huns\r\nwere Tartars also.\r\n\r\nGenghis usually found some excuse for making war on others, but if\r\nhe couldn’t find a good excuse he made up one, for he was bent on\r\nconquering. He and his Tartars thought no more of killing than would\r\ntigers or lions let loose.\r\n\r\nSo Genghis and his horsemen swept over the land from Cathay toward\r\nEurope. They burned and destroyed thousands upon thousands of towns and\r\ncities and everything in their way. They slew men, women, and children\r\nby the million. No one was able to stop them. It seemed as if they\r\nwere going to wipe off of the face of the earth all white people and\r\neverything that white people had built.\r\n\r\nGenghis Khan had conquered the whole land from the Pacific Ocean to the\r\neastern part of Europe. But at last he stopped. With this kingdom he\r\nseemed to be satisfied. And he might well have been satisfied, for it\r\nwas larger than the Roman Empire or that of even Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nEven when Genghis died, things were no better, for his son was just as\r\nfrightful as his father and conquered still more country.\r\n\r\nBut the grandson of Genghis Khan was much less ferocious than his\r\ngrandfather had been. He was named Kublai Khan, and he was quite\r\ndifferent from his father and grandfather. He made his capital at\r\na place in China now called Peking and ruled over this vast empire\r\nthat he had inherited from his father. Kublai’s chief interest was in\r\nbuilding magnificent palaces and surrounding himself with beautiful\r\ngardens, and he made such a wonderful capital for himself that Solomon\r\nin all his glory did not live in such splendor as did Kublai Khan.\r\n\r\nNow, far, far off from Peking and the palace of Kublai Khan, in the\r\nnorth of Italy was a city built on the water. Its streets were of\r\nwater, and boats were used instead of carriages. This city was called\r\nVenice. About the Year 1300 there were living in Venice two men named\r\nPolo. The Polos got an idea in their heads that they would like to see\r\nsomething of the world. So these two Venetians, and the son of one\r\nof them named Marco Polo, started off toward the rising sun looking\r\nfor adventure, just like boys in story-books who go off to seek their\r\nfortunes. After several years of travel, always toward the east, they\r\nat last came to the gardens and to the magnificent palace of Kublai\r\nKhan.\r\n\r\nWhen Kublai Khan heard that strange white men from a far-off place and\r\nan unknown country were outside the palace, he wanted to see them.\r\nSo they were brought into his presence. They told Kublai Khan all\r\nabout their own land. They were good story-tellers, and they made it\r\ninteresting. They told him also about the Christian religion and many\r\nother things that he had never heard of.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was so much interested in the Polos and in the stories they\r\ntold about their country that he wanted to hear more. So he persuaded\r\nthem to stay with him and tell him more. He gave them rich presents.\r\nThen he made them his advisers and assistants in ruling his empire.\r\nSo the Polos stayed on for years and years and years and learned the\r\nlanguage and came to be very important people in Cathay.\r\n\r\nAt last after they had spent about twenty years in Cathay the Polos\r\nthought it was about time to go home and see their own people again. So\r\nthey begged leave to return. Kublai Khan did not want them to go. They\r\nwere so useful to him and helped him so much in ruling that he didn’t\r\nwant to lose them. But in the end he did let them go, and they started\r\nback to what once had been their home.\r\n\r\nWhen they at last arrived in Venice, they had been away so long and had\r\nbeen traveling so far that no one knew them. They had almost forgotten\r\nhow to speak their own language, and they talked like foreigners.\r\nTheir clothes had become worn out and ragged by their long trip. They\r\nlooked like tramps, and not even their old friends recognized them. No\r\none would believe that these ragged, dirty strangers were the same fine\r\nVenetian gentlemen who had disappeared almost twenty years before.\r\n\r\nThe Polos told their townspeople all about their adventures and the\r\nwonderfully rich lands and cities that they had visited. But the\r\ntownspeople only laughed at them, for they thought them story-tellers.\r\n\r\nThen the Polos ripped open their ragged garments, and out fell piles\r\nof magnificent and costly jewels, diamonds and rubies and sapphires\r\nand pearls--enough to buy a kingdom. The people looked in wonder and\r\namazement and began to believe.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo told his stories to a man who wrote them down and made a\r\nbook of them called “The Travels of Marco Polo.” This is an interesting\r\nbook for you to read even to-day, although we cannot believe all the\r\ntales he told. We know that he exaggerated a great many things, for he\r\nliked to amaze people.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo described the magnificence of Kublai Khan’s palace. He told\r\nof its enormous dining-hall, where thousands of guests could sit down\r\nat the table at one time. He told of a bird so huge that it could\r\nfly away with an elephant. He said that Noah’s Ark was still on Mount\r\nArarat, only the mountain was so high and so dangerous to climb on\r\naccount of the ice and snow with which it was covered that no one could\r\ngo to see if the ark really were there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\n“Thing-a-ma-jigger” and “What-cher-may-call-it” or a Magic Needle and a\r\nMagic Powder\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this same time that Marco Polo returned from his travels, people\r\nin Europe began to hear and talk about a magic needle and a magic\r\npowder that did remarkable things, and some say that Marco brought\r\nthem back from Cathay, but this we doubt. The little magic needle when\r\nfloated on a straw or held up only at its middle would always turn\r\ntowards the north no matter how much you twisted it. Such a needle put\r\nin a case was called a compass.\r\n\r\nNow, you may not see why such a little thing was so remarkable. But\r\nstrange as it may seem, this little thing really made it possible to\r\ndiscover a new world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have played the game in which a child is blindfolded,\r\ntwisted around several times in the center of the room, and then told\r\nto go toward the door or the window or some other point in the room.\r\nYou know how impossible it is for one who has been so turned round to\r\ntell which way to go, and you know how absurd one looks who goes in\r\nquite the opposite direction when he thinks he is going straight.\r\n\r\nWell, the sailor at sea was something like such a blindfolded child. Of\r\ncourse, if the weather were fine he could tell by the sun or the stars\r\nwhich way he should go. But when the weather was cloudy and bad there\r\nwas nothing for him to go by. He was then like the blindfolded child.\r\nHe might easily become confused and sail in just the opposite direction\r\nfrom the way he wanted to go without knowing the difference.\r\n\r\nThis was perhaps one of the chief reasons why sailors, before the\r\ncompass was used, had not gone far out of sight of land. They were\r\nafraid they might not be able to find their way back. So only that part\r\nof the world was known which could be reached by land or without going\r\nfar out of sight of land.\r\n\r\nBut, with the compass, sailors could sail on and on through storm and\r\ncloudy weather and keep always in the direction they wanted to go. They\r\nsimply had to follow the little magnetic needle suspended in its box.\r\nNo matter how much the boat turned or twisted or tossed, the little\r\nneedle always pointed to the north. Of course sailors did not always\r\nwant to go north, but it was very easy to tell any other direction if\r\nthey knew which was north. South was exactly opposite, east was to the\r\nright, and west was to the left. So all they had to do was to steer the\r\nboat on the course in whatever direction they wished.\r\n\r\nIt was a long while, however, before sailors would use a compass.\r\nThey thought it was bewitched by some magic, and they were afraid\r\nto have anything to do with such a thing. Sailors are likely to be\r\nsuperstitious, and they were afraid that if they took the compass on\r\nboard it might bewitch their ship and bring them bad luck.\r\n\r\nThe other magic thing was gunpowder.\r\n\r\nNever before 1300 had there been such things in Europe as guns or\r\ncannons or pistols. All fighting had been done with bows and arrows or\r\nswords or spears or with some such weapons. A sword can only be used on\r\na man a few feet away, but with guns an enemy may be killed and walls\r\nbattered down miles away. But after gunpowder was invented the armor\r\nwhich the old knights wore was of course no longer of any use, for it\r\ncould not protect them from shot and shell. So gunpowder has changed\r\nfighting completely and made war the terrible thing it has become.\r\n\r\nAlthough Marco Polo was supposed to have told about gunpowder and its\r\nuse in cannons as he had seen it in the East, most people think that\r\nan English monk named Roger Bacon knew about gunpowder and also about\r\nthe compass and perhaps invented them. The monk Bacon knew about so\r\nmany things which people at that time thought were magic that he was\r\nsupposed to be in league with the devil, and so he was put in prison.\r\nBacon was the wisest man of his time, but he was ahead of his time.\r\nIf he were living now he would be honored as a great scientist and\r\ninventor. But people thought he knew _too_ much--that any one who knew\r\nas much as he did was wicked--that he was prying into God’s secrets,\r\nwhich God did not want any one to know.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, give the credit or the blame for the invention of\r\ngunpowder to a German chemist named Schwarz. They say that one day\r\nSchwarz was mixing some chemicals in an iron bowl with an iron mixer\r\ncalled a _pestle_, such as druggists use, when, all of a sudden,\r\nthe mixture exploded and shot the iron pestle right up through the\r\nceiling. Schwarz was much surprised; he had had a narrow escape from\r\nbeing killed; but this gave him an idea. Immediately he set to work\r\nto think out a way to use the same mixture in battle to shoot iron\r\npestles at the enemy. Some people think it would have been far better\r\nif the pestle had struck and killed Mr. Schwarz at the time, and if his\r\nsecret had been destroyed with him. We might then never have had the\r\nterrible wars and the killing of millions of human beings which have\r\nresulted from this discovery. It was quite a while, however, before\r\ngunpowder was made strong enough to do much damage. In fact, it was\r\nover a hundred years before fighting with guns entirely took the place\r\nof fighting with bows and arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\nThelon Gest Wart Hate Verwas\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this another Latin heading?\r\n\r\nNo, it’s English.\r\n\r\nDon’t you understand English?\r\n\r\nIt was 1338, and Edward III was king of England. Edward III wanted to\r\nrule France as well as England. He said he was related to the former\r\nking of France and had a better right to the country than the one who\r\nwas ruling. So he started a war to take France, and the war he started\r\nlasted more than a hundred years. So this is known as the Hundred\r\nYears’ War and it is:\r\n\r\n The Longest War that Ever Was!\r\n\r\nThe English army sailed over from England and landed in France. The\r\nfirst great battle was fought at a little place called Crécy. The\r\nEnglish army was on foot and was made up chiefly of the common people.\r\nThe French army were mostly knights clad in armor on horseback--the\r\nsociety people.\r\n\r\nThe French knights on horseback thought themselves much finer than the\r\ncommon English soldiers who were on foot, as a man in a motor-car is\r\nlikely to look down on the man who is walking.\r\n\r\nThe English soldiers, however, used a weapon called the _longbow_,\r\nwhich shot arrows with terrific force, and they completely whipped the\r\nFrench knights in spite of the fact that the knights were nobles, were\r\ntrained to be fighters, rode on horses, and were protected by armor.\r\n\r\nCannon were used by the English in this battle for the first time. The\r\ncannon, however, did not amount to much nor do very much harm. They\r\nwere so weak that they simply tossed the cannon-balls at the enemy as\r\none might throw a basketball or football. They scared the horses of the\r\nFrench but did little other damage. But this was the beginning of what\r\nwas before long to be the end of knights and armor and feudalism.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Crécy was only the beginning of the Hundred Years’ War.\r\nThe next year after the battle of Crécy a horribly contagious disease\r\ncalled the Black Death attacked the people of Europe. It was like the\r\nplague in Athens in the Age of Pericles, but the Black Death did not\r\nattack just one city or country. It was supposed to have started in\r\nCathay, but it spread westward until it reached Europe. There was no\r\nrunning away from it. It spread far and wide over the whole land and\r\nkilled more human beings than any war that has ever been. It was called\r\nBlack Death because black spots came out all over the body of any one\r\nwho caught it, and he was certain to die within a few hours or a day\r\nor two. There was no hope. No medicine had any effect. Many people\r\ncommitted suicide just as soon as they found they had the disease. Many\r\ndied just from fright, actually “scared to death.”\r\n\r\nIt lasted two years, and millions upon millions caught the disease.\r\nHalf of the people of Europe died of it. Whole towns were wiped out,\r\nand in many places no one was left to bury the dead. Dead bodies\r\nlay where they had fallen--on the street, in the doorway, in the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\nThe crops in the fields went to waste, for there was no one to gather\r\nthem. Horses and cows roamed over the country at will, for there was\r\nno one to care for them. The plague attacked even sailors at sea, and\r\nships were found drifting about on the water with not a soul alive left\r\non board, with not even one left to steer the ship.\r\n\r\nWhat if it had killed every last man, woman, and child in the world!\r\nWhat then would have been the future history of the world?\r\n\r\nBut, as if there were not enough people dead already, the Hundred\r\nYears’ War still went on year after year. The soldiers who had fought\r\nat Crécy had been dead for years. Their children had grown up, fought,\r\nand died; their grandchildren had grown up, fought and died, and their\r\ngreat-grandchildren had done the same; and the English army was still\r\nfighting in France. The French prince at that time was very young and\r\nweak, and the French were almost in despair--hopeless--because they had\r\nno strong leader to help them drive out the English after all these\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little French village there was living a poor peasant girl,\r\na shepherdess, called Joan of Arc. As she watched her flocks of sheep,\r\nshe had wonderful visions. She heard voices calling to her, telling her\r\nshe was the one who must lead the French armies and save France from\r\nEngland. She went to the prince’s nobles and told them her visions.\r\nBut they did not put any faith in her or her visions, and they did not\r\nbelieve she was able to do the things she thought she could.\r\n\r\nTo test her, however, they dressed up another man as the prince and put\r\nhim on the throne while the prince stood at one side with the nobles.\r\nThen they let Joan into the room. When Joan entered the royal hall, she\r\ngave one look at the man who was seated on the throne and dressed up as\r\nprince. Then without hesitating she walked directly past him and went\r\nstraight to the _real_ prince. Before him she knelt and said, “I have\r\ncome to lead your armies to victory.” The prince at once gave her his\r\nflag and a suit of armor, and she rode out at the head of all the army\r\nand had him crowned king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joan of Arc at the stake.]\r\n\r\nThe French soldiers took heart again. It seemed as if the Lord had\r\nsent an angel to lead them, and they fought so hard and so bravely that\r\nthey won many battles.\r\n\r\nThe English soldiers, however, thought that it was not the Lord but\r\nthe devil who had sent Joan and that she was not an angel but a witch,\r\nand they were very much afraid of her. At last, the English made her\r\nprisoner. The French king, whom she had saved, in spite of all she\r\nhad done for him, didn’t even try to save her. Now that things were\r\ngoing his way, he didn’t like to have a woman running things, and the\r\nsoldiers didn’t like to have a woman ordering them around, and they\r\nwere glad to be rid of her.\r\n\r\nThe English tried her for a witch, judged her guilty of being a witch,\r\nand then they burned her alive at the stake.\r\n\r\nBut Joan seemed to have brought the French good luck, to have put\r\nnew life into their armies, for from that time on, France increased\r\nin strength, and after more than a hundred years of fighting at last\r\ndrove the English out of the country. In one hundred years of fighting\r\nhundreds of thousands of people had been wounded and crippled and\r\nblinded and killed, and after it all England was no better off, just\r\nthe same as when she started--all the fighting all for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\nPrint and Powder or Off with the Old On with the New\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this time there was not a printed book in the whole world. There\r\nwas not a newspaper. There was not a magazine. All books had to be\r\nwritten by hand. This, of course, was extremely slow and expensive, so\r\nthere were very few of even these handwritten books in all the world.\r\nOnly kings and very wealthy people had any books at all. Such a book as\r\nthe Bible, for instance, cost almost as much as a house, and so no poor\r\npeople could own such a thing. Even when there was a Bible in a church,\r\nit was so valuable that it had to be chained to keep it from being\r\nstolen. Think of stealing a Bible!\r\n\r\nBut about 1440 a man thought of a new way to make books. First he put\r\ntogether wooden letters called type, and then smeared them with ink.\r\nThen he pressed paper against this inky type and made a copy. After\r\nthe type was once set up, thousands of copies could be made quickly\r\nand easily. This, as you of course know, was printing. It all seems so\r\nsimple, the wonder is that no one had thought of printing thousands of\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that a German named Gutenberg made the first\r\nprinted books about 1440, so he is called the inventor of printing. And\r\nwhat do you suppose was the first book ever printed? Why, the book that\r\npeople thought the most important book in the world--the Bible. This\r\nBible was not printed in English, however, nor in German, but in Latin!\r\n\r\nThe first book printed in English was made in England by an English\r\nman named Caxton, and you would never guess what the English book was.\r\nIt was a description of the game of chess, the game that the Arabs had\r\ninvented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gutenberg at his press. Comparing a printed sheet with a\r\nmanuscript.]\r\n\r\nBefore this time few people, even though they were kings and princes,\r\nknew how to read, because there were no books to teach them how to\r\nread and few books for them to read if they had learned, and so what\r\nwas the use of learning.\r\n\r\nYou can see how difficult it must have been for people throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages, without books or newspapers or anything printed, to learn\r\nwhat was going on in the world, or to learn about anything that one\r\nwanted to know.\r\n\r\nBut, now that printing had been invented, all that was changed.\r\nStory-books and school-books and other books could be made in large\r\nnumbers and very cheaply. People who never before were able to have\r\nany books could now own them. Every one could now read all the famous\r\nstories of the world and learn about geography, about history, about\r\nanything he wanted to know. So the invention of printing was soon to\r\nchange everything.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Years’ War had at last come to an end soon after the\r\ninvention of printing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time something else that was a thousand years old came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans whom we haven’t heard of for a long time, had tried to\r\ncapture Constantinople in the seventh century, but had been stopped, as\r\nI told you, by tar and pitch that the Christians poured down on them.\r\n\r\nBut in 1458 the Mohammedans once again attacked Constantinople. This\r\ntime, however, the Mohammedans were Turks, and they didn’t try to\r\nbatter down the walls of the city with arrows. They used gunpowder and\r\ncannon. Cannon had been used at Crécy more than a hundred years before,\r\nbut they had done little damage. Since that time, however, they had\r\nbecome greatly improved. Against the power of this new invention the\r\nwalls of Constantinople could not stand, and finally the city fell.\r\nSo Constantinople became Turkish, and the magnificent Church of Santa\r\nSophia, which Justinian had built a thousand years before, was turned\r\ninto a Mohammedan mosque. This was the end of all that was left of the\r\nold Roman Empire--the other half of which had fallen in 476.\r\n\r\nEver after the downfall of Constantinople in 1453, wars were fought\r\nwith gunpowder. No longer were castles of any use. No longer were\r\nknights in armor of any use. No longer were bows and arrows of any\r\nuse--against this new kind of fighting. There was a new sound in the\r\nworld, the sound of cannon-firing: “Boom! boom! boom!” Before this,\r\nbattles had not been very noisy except for shouts of the victors and\r\nthe moans of the dying. So 1453 is called the end of the Middle Ages,\r\nand the beginning of the New Ages that were to follow.\r\n\r\nGunpowder had put an end to the Middle Ages. The invention of printing\r\nand that little magic needle, the compass, did a great deal to start\r\nthe New Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\nA Sailor Who Found a New World\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat book do you like best?\r\n\r\n“Alice in Wonderland”?\r\n\r\n“Gulliver’s Travels”?\r\n\r\nOne of the first books to be printed and one that boys at that time\r\nliked best was\r\n\r\n  “The Travels of Marco Polo”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys who loved to read these stories of those far-away\r\ncountries of the East with their gold and precious jewels was an\r\nItalian named Christopher Columbus. Christopher Columbus was born in\r\nthe city of Genoa, which is in the top of the “boot.” Like a great many\r\nother boys who were born in seaport towns, he had heard the sailors on\r\nthe wharves tell yarns of their travels, and his greatest ambition in\r\nlife was to go off to sea and visit all the wonderful lands of which\r\nhe had read and been told. At last the chance came, and, though only\r\nfourteen years old, he made his first voyage. After that, Columbus made\r\nmany other voyages and grew to be a middle-aged man, but he never got\r\nto these countries he had read about in “The Travels of Marco Polo.”\r\n\r\nMany sea-captains of that time were trying to find a shorter way to\r\nIndia than the long and tiresome one that Marco Polo had taken. They\r\nfelt sure there was a shorter way by sea and now that they had the\r\ncompass to guide them they dared to go far off searching for such a\r\nwaterway.\r\n\r\nBy this time many books had already been printed. Some of these books\r\non travel were written by the old Greeks and Romans and declared what\r\nwas thought to be a crazy notion that the world was not flat but round.\r\nColumbus had read these books and he said to himself that if the world\r\nis really round, one should be able to reach India by sailing toward\r\nthe west. It should be much easier and shorter that way than if one\r\ntook a boat to the end of the Mediterranean Sea and then went over land\r\nfor thousands of miles the way Marco Polo had gone.\r\n\r\nThe more Columbus thought of the idea, the surer he was that this could\r\nbe done and the more eager he was to get a ship to try out his idea.\r\nBut every one laughed at him and his notion as foolish. Of course,\r\nbeing only a sailor, he had no money to buy or hire a ship in which to\r\nmake the trial and he could find no one to help him.\r\n\r\nSo first Columbus went to the little country called Portugal. Portugal\r\nwas right on the ocean’s edge. It was to be expected then that the\r\npeople of Portugal would be famous sailors, and they _were_--as famous\r\nas the Phenicians had been of old. So Columbus thought they might\r\nbe interested and help. Besides, the king of Portugal was extremely\r\ninterested in discovering new lands.\r\n\r\nBut the king of Portugal thought, as the others did, that Columbus\r\nwas foolish and would have nothing to do with him. The king wanted to\r\nmake quite sure, however, that there was nothing in Columbus’s idea.\r\nFurthermore, if there were any new land, he wanted to be the first to\r\ndiscover it himself. So he secretly sent some of his sea-captains off\r\nto explore. After a while they one and all returned and stated that\r\nthey had been as far as it was safe to go and that positively there was\r\nnothing at all to the west but water, water, water.\r\n\r\nSo Columbus in disgust then went to the next country--Spain--which at\r\nthat time was ruled by King Ferdinand and his queen Isabella. King\r\nFerdinand and Queen Isabella were just then too busy to listen to\r\nColumbus. They were fighting with the Mohammedans, who had been in\r\ntheir country ever since 732, when, you remember, they got as far north\r\nas France. But at last Ferdinand and Isabella succeeded in driving the\r\nMohammedans out of their country, and then Queen Isabella became very\r\nmuch interested in Columbus’s ideas and plans and finally promised to\r\nhelp him. She even said she would sell her jewels, if necessary, to\r\ngive him the money to buy ships. But she didn’t have to do this. So\r\nColumbus with her help was able to buy three little ships named the\r\n_Niña_, _Pinta_, and _Santa María_. So small were these three boats\r\nthat nowadays we would have been afraid to go even out of sight of\r\nshore in them.\r\n\r\nAt last everything was ready, and Columbus set sail from the Spanish\r\nseaport of Palos with about a hundred sailors. Many of the sailors\r\nwere criminals, who had been given a choice between prison and this\r\ndangerous voyage. They chose to risk their lives rather than to stay\r\nin prison. Directly toward the setting sun into the broad Atlantic,\r\nColumbus steered. Past the Canary Islands he sailed, on and on, day and\r\nnight, always in the same direction.\r\n\r\nSee if you can get this idea--the idea that every one had at that\r\ntime--that all there was of the world was what we have so far been\r\nstudying about. Try to forget that you ever heard of North and South\r\nAmerica. They, of course, knew of no such lands. Try to think of\r\nColumbus on deck scanning the waves in the daytime or peering off in\r\nthe darkness at night, hoping sooner or later to sight, not a new\r\nland--he wasn’t looking for a new land--but for China or India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Columbus arguing with his crew.]\r\n\r\nColumbus had been out for over a month, and his sailors began to\r\nget worried. It seemed impossible that any sea could be so vast, so\r\nendless, with nothing in sight before, behind, or on either side. They\r\nbegan to think about returning. They began to be afraid they would\r\nnever reach home. They begged Columbus to turn back. They said it was\r\ncrazy to go any farther; there was nothing but water ahead of them, and\r\nthey could go on forever and ever, and there would never be anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nColumbus argued with them, but it was no use. Finally he promised\r\nto turn back if they did not reach something very soon. As the days\r\nwent on still with nothing new, the sailors plotted to throw Columbus\r\noverboard at night and so get rid of him. They would then sail home and\r\ntell those back in Spain that Columbus had fallen overboard by accident.\r\n\r\nAt last, when all had given up hope except Columbus, a sailor saw a\r\nbranch with berries on it floating in the water. Where could it have\r\ncome from? Then birds were seen flying--birds that never get very far\r\naway from shore. Then one dark night, more than two months after they\r\nhad set sail, they saw far off ahead a twinkling light. Probably no\r\nlittle light ever gave so much joy in the world. A light meant only\r\none thing--human beings--and land, land--land at last! And then on\r\nthe morning of October 12, 1492, the three boats ran ashore. Columbus\r\nleaped out, and falling on his knees, offered up a prayer of thanks\r\nto God. He then raised the Spanish flag, took possession of the land\r\nin the name of Spain, and called it “San Salvador,” which means in\r\nSpanish, “Holy Saviour.”\r\n\r\nNow, Columbus thought this land was India that he had at last reached,\r\nthough of course we know now that a great continent, North and South\r\nAmerica, blocked his way to India. In fact, it was only a little island\r\noff the coast of America where he had landed.\r\n\r\nStrange men were the human beings he saw there. Their bodies and faces\r\nwere painted, and they had feathers in their hair. As Columbus thought\r\nthey must be people of India, he called them Indians, the name they\r\nstill bear.\r\n\r\nColumbus went on to other islands near-by; but he did not find any gold\r\nnor precious stones such as he had expected, or the wonders that Marco\r\nPolo had described; and as he had been away so long, he started back\r\nagain to Spain the way he had come. With him he took several Indians\r\nto show the people at home, and also some tobacco, which he found them\r\nsmoking and which no one had even seen or heard of before.\r\n\r\nWhen he at last reached home safely again, people were overjoyed\r\nat seeing him and hearing of his discoveries. Everyone was wildly\r\nexcited--but only for a while. People soon began to say it was nothing\r\nfor Columbus to have sailed westward until land was found, that anyone\r\ncould do that.\r\n\r\nOne day when Columbus was dining with the king’s nobles, who were\r\ntrying to belittle what he had done, he took an egg and, passing it\r\naround the table, asked each one if he could stand it on end. No one\r\ncould. When it came back to Columbus, he set it down just hard enough\r\nto crack the end slightly and flatten it. Of course, _then_ it stood\r\nup. “You see,” said Columbus, “it’s very easy if you only know how. So\r\nit’s easy enough to sail west until you find land after I have done it\r\nonce and shown you how.”\r\n\r\nColumbus made three other voyages to America, four in all, but he never\r\nknew he had discovered a new world. Once he landed in South America,\r\nbut he never reached North America itself.\r\n\r\nAs Columbus did not bring back any of the precious jewels or wonderful\r\nthings that those in Spain expected him to, people lost interest in\r\nhim. Some were so spiteful and jealous of his success that they even\r\ncharged him with wrongdoing, and King Ferdinand sent out a man to\r\ntake his place. Columbus was put in chains and shipped home. Although\r\nhe was promptly set free, Columbus kept the chains as a reminder of\r\nmen’s ingratitude and asked to have them buried with him. After this,\r\nColumbus made one other voyage, but when at last he died in Spain he\r\nwas alone and almost forgotten even by his friends. What an end for the\r\nman who had given a new continent to the world and changed all history!\r\n\r\nOf all the men of whom we have heard, whether kings or queens, princes\r\nor emperors, none can compare with Columbus. Alexander the Great,\r\nJulius Cæsar, Charlemagne, were all killers. They took away. But\r\nColumbus _gave_. He gave us a new world. Without money or friends or\r\nluck, he stuck to his ideas through long years of discouragement.\r\nAlthough made fun of and called a crank and even treated as a criminal\r\nhe never\r\n\r\n  gave up,\r\n    gave out, nor\r\n      gave in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\nFortune-Hunters\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New World had no name.\r\n\r\nIt was simply called the “New World,” as one might speak of the “new\r\nbaby.”\r\n\r\nIt had to have a name, but what should it be?\r\n\r\nOf course if we could have chosen the name, we should have called it\r\n“Columbia” after Columbus. But another name was selected, and this is\r\nhow it happened.\r\n\r\nAn Italian named Americus made a voyage to the southern part of the New\r\nWorld. Then he wrote a book about his travels. People read his book and\r\nbegan to speak of the new land that Americus described as Americus’s\r\ncountry. And so the New World came to be called America after Americus,\r\nalthough in all fairness it should have been named after Columbus;\r\ndon’t you think so? Children sometimes have names given them which they\r\nwould like to change when they grow up. But then it is too late. So we\r\noften speak and sing of our country as Columbia, although that is not\r\nthe name on the map. And that is why we call a great many cities and\r\ntowns and districts and streets Columbus or Columbia.\r\n\r\nAfter Columbus had shown that there was no danger of falling off the\r\nworld and that there really was land off to the west, almost every one\r\nwho had been hunting for India now rushed off in the direction Columbus\r\nhad taken. “Copy cats!” A genius starts something; then thousands\r\nfollow--imitate. Every sea-captain who could do so now hurried off to\r\nthe west to look for new countries, and so many discoveries were made\r\nthat this time is known as the Age of Discovery. Most of these men were\r\ntrying to get to India. They were after gold and jewels and spices,\r\nwhich they thought they would find in India in great quantities.\r\n\r\nNow we can understand why people might go long distances in search\r\nof gold and precious stones, but they also went after spices--such\r\nas cloves and pepper--and you may wonder why they were so eager to\r\nget spices? You yourself may not like pepper very much, and you may\r\ndislike cloves. But in those days they didn’t have refrigerators filled\r\nwith ice, and meats and other foods were often spoiled. We would have\r\nthought such food unfit to eat. But they covered it with spices to kill\r\nthe bad flavor, and then food could be eaten that otherwise one could\r\nnot have swallowed. Spices didn’t grow in Europe--only in the far east.\r\nSo people paid big prices to get them, and that is why men made long\r\njourneys after them.\r\n\r\nA Portuguese sailor named Vasco da Gama was one of those who were\r\ntrying to get to India all the way by water. He did not, however, sail\r\n_west_ as Columbus had done, but _south_ down around Africa. Others\r\nhad tried before to get to India by going south and around Africa, but\r\nnone had gone more than part way. Many frightful stories were told by\r\nthose who had tried but had at last turned back. These stories were\r\nlike the tales of “Sindbad the Sailor.” They said that the sea became\r\nboiling hot; they said that there was a magnetic mountain which would\r\npull out the iron bolts in the ship, and the ship would then fall to\r\npieces; they said that there was a whirlpool into which a ship would\r\nbe irresistibly drawn--down, down, down to the bottom; they said there\r\nwere sea-serpents, monsters so large that they could swallow a ship at\r\none gulp. The southern point of Africa was called the Cape of Storms,\r\nand the very name seemed to be bad luck, so that it was changed to Cape\r\nof Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all such scary stories, Vasco da Gama kept on his way\r\nsouth. Finally, after many hardships and many adventures, he passed\r\nround the Cape of Good Hope. Then he sailed on to India, got the spices\r\nthat then were so highly prized, and returned safely home. This was in\r\n1497, five years after Columbus’s first voyage, and Vasco da Gama\r\nwas the first one to go to India by water. Spain had the honor of\r\ndiscovering a new land. Portugal had the honor of first reaching India\r\nby water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15ᵗͪ Century Map of Africa]\r\n\r\nEngland also was to have the honor of making discoveries. In the same\r\nyear that Vasco da Gama reached India, a man named Cabot set sail\r\nfrom England on a voyage of discovery. His first trip was a failure,\r\nbut he tried again and finally came to Canada and sailed along the\r\ncoast of what is now the United States. These countries he claimed for\r\nEngland, but he returned home, and England did nothing more about his\r\ndiscoveries until about a hundred years later.\r\n\r\nAnother Spaniard named Balboa explored the central part of America. He\r\nwas on the little strip of land that joined North and South America\r\nwhich we now call the Isthmus of Panama. Suddenly he came to another\r\ngreat ocean. This strange new ocean he named the South Sea, for\r\nalthough the Isthmus of Panama connects North and South America, it\r\nbends so that one looks _south_ over the ocean.\r\n\r\nThen came the longest trip of all. A Portuguese named Magellan wanted\r\nto find a way to India _through_ the New World, for he thought there\r\nmust be some opening through which he might pass this new land that\r\nblocked the way. He tried to get his own country to help him. But\r\nagain Portugal made the same mistake she had made in the case of\r\nColumbus. She would not listen to Magellan. So Magellan went to Spain,\r\nand Spain gave him five ships.\r\n\r\nWith these five ships Magellan sailed off across the sea. When he\r\nreached South America he sailed south along the shore trying to find\r\na passage through the land. One place after another seemed to be the\r\npassage for which he was looking, but each one turned out to be nothing\r\nbut a river’s mouth. Then one of his ships was wrecked, and only four\r\nwere left.\r\n\r\nWith these four ships he still kept on down the coast until he finally\r\nreached what is now Cape Horn. Through the dangerous opening there,\r\nsince called after him the Straits of Magellan, he worked his way. One\r\nship deserted and went back home the way it had come. Only three were\r\nthen left.\r\n\r\nWith these three ships he at last came into the great ocean on the\r\nother side, the same ocean that Balboa had called the South Sea. This\r\nMagellan named the “Pacific,” which means “calm,” because after all the\r\nstorms they had had it seemed so calm and quiet. But food and water\r\nbecame scarce and finally gave out. Magellan’s men suffered terribly\r\nfrom thirst and hunger and even ate the rats that are always to be\r\nfound on shipboard. Many of his men were taken sick and died. Still\r\nhe kept on, though he had lost most of the crew with which he had set\r\nout. At last he reached what are now the Philippine Islands, where the\r\npeople were savages. Here he and his men got into a battle with the\r\nnatives, and Magellan was killed. There were now not enough men left\r\nto sail three ships, and so one of these was burned, and only two were\r\nthen left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magellan’s Victoria. (From an old print.)]\r\n\r\nTwo of the ships, however, out of the five with which Magellan had\r\nstarted out, still kept on. Then one of these was lost, disappeared,\r\nand was never heard of again, and only a single ship named the\r\n_Victoria_, remained. It seemed as if not one ship, not one man, would\r\nbe left to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nAround Africa the _Victoria_ struggled. Magellan’s men, worn out with\r\nhunger and cold and hardships, still battled against wind and storm.\r\nAt last a leaky and broken ship with only eighteen men sailed into the\r\nharbor from which it had set out more than three years before. And\r\nso the _Victoria--Victory!_--Magellan’s ship, but without the heroic\r\nMagellan--was the first ship to sail completely round the world. This\r\nvoyage settled forever the argument that had been going on for ages,\r\nwhether the earth was round or flat, for a ship had actually sailed\r\naround the world! And yet in spite of this proof for many more years\r\nthereafter there were people who still would not believe the world was\r\nround, and even to-day there are people who say the world is flat, but\r\nnow we call them _cranks_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1520 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61\r\n\r\nThe Land of Enchantment or the Search for Gold and Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sorts of marvelous tales were told about the wealth and wonders of\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\nIt was said that somewhere in the New World there was a _fountain of\r\nyouth_, and that if you bathed in it or drank of its water, you would\r\nbecome young again.\r\n\r\nIt was said that somewhere in the New World there was a city called El\r\nDorado built of solid gold.\r\n\r\nSo every one who liked adventure and could get enough money together\r\nwent off in search of these things that might make him famous or\r\nhealthy, wealthy or wise, or forever young.\r\n\r\nOne of these men was Ponce de León. Ponce de León was looking for the\r\n_fountain of youth_. While searching for this life-giving water, he\r\ndiscovered Florida. But instead of finding the fountain of youth, he\r\nlost his life in fighting with the Indians.\r\n\r\nAnother one of these men was de Soto. He was searching for El Dorado,\r\nthe city of gold. While doing so he discovered the longest river in\r\nthe world--the Mississippi. But instead of finding El Dorado, de Soto\r\nwas taken sick with fever and died. Now, the Spaniards, to make the\r\nIndians fear them, had said that de Soto was a god and could not die.\r\nSo in order to cover up the fact that de Soto had actually died his men\r\nburied him at night in the river he had discovered. They then told the\r\nIndians that he had gone on a trip to heaven and would presently return.\r\n\r\nThe central part of America was called Mexico. Here lived at that time\r\na tribe of Indians known as Aztecs. These Aztecs were more civilized\r\nthan the other Indians that the explorers had come across. They did not\r\nlive in tents but in houses. They built fine temples and palaces. They\r\nmade roads and aqueducts, something like those of the Romans. They had\r\nenormous treasures of silver and gold. And yet the Aztecs worshiped\r\nidols and sacrificed human beings to them. Their king was a famous\r\nchief named Montezuma.\r\n\r\nA Spaniard named Cortés was sent to conquer these Aztecs. He landed\r\non the shore of Mexico and burned his ships so that his sailors and\r\nsoldiers could not turn back. The Aztecs thought these white-faced\r\npeople were gods who had come down from heaven and that their ships\r\nwith their white sails were white-winged birds that had borne them.\r\nThey had never seen horses, some of which the Spaniards had brought\r\nover across the water, and they were astonished at what seemed to them\r\nterrible beasts that the white men rode. When the Spaniards fired their\r\ncannons, the Aztecs were terrified. They thought it was thunder and\r\nlightning that the Spaniards had let loose.\r\n\r\nCortés moved on toward the Aztec capital, the City of Mexico, which was\r\nbuilt on an island in the middle of a lake. The natives he met on the\r\nway fought desperately, but as they had only such weapons as men used\r\nin the Stone and Bronze Ages, they were no match against the guns and\r\ncannons of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMontezuma, their chief, wishing to make friends with these white gods,\r\nsent Cortés rich gifts, cart-loads of gold, and when Cortés reached the\r\ncapital city Montezuma treated him as a guest instead of an enemy and\r\nentertained him and could not do enough for him. Cortés told Montezuma\r\nall about the Christian religion and tried to make him a Christian\r\nalso, but Montezuma thought his own gods just as good as the Christian\r\nGod, and he would not change. Then suddenly Cortés took Montezuma\r\nprisoner, and terrible fighting began. At last Montezuma was killed,\r\nand Cortés of course succeeded in conquering Mexico, for though the\r\nAztecs fought desperately and bravely, shot and shell were too much for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn Peru in South America was still another tribe of civilized Indians\r\neven more wealthy than the Aztecs. They were called Incas, and it was\r\nsaid that their cities were paved with gold.\r\n\r\nAnother Spaniard named Pizarro went to Peru to conquer it as Cortés had\r\nconquered Mexico. Pizarro told the ruler, who was called the Inca, that\r\nthe pope had given the country to Spain. The Inca had never heard of\r\nthe pope and must have wondered what the pope had to do with Peru and\r\nhow he could give it away. So naturally the Inca would not give up his\r\ncountry to Spain. Then Pizarro _took_ it away. He had but a few hundred\r\nmen, but he had cannon, and of course the Incas could not stand out\r\nagainst cannon.\r\n\r\nFrance and other countries of Europe also sent out explorers to conquer\r\nparts of America, and then missionaries to teach the Indians the\r\nChristian religion, but these you will hear more about when you study\r\nAmerican History.\r\n\r\nMany of the explorers were really pirates, even worse pirates than the\r\nNorsemen who raided England and France, because they murdered people\r\nwho were without equal weapons to fight back. The excuse they often\r\ngave for doing so was that they wanted to make the natives Christians.\r\nNo wonder that the natives did not think much of the Christian religion\r\nif it taught murder of people who could not defend themselves. The\r\nMohammedans made converts with the sword, but the Christians made\r\nconverts with shot and shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\nBorn Again\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a long word for you: it is Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIt means: born again.\r\n\r\nOf course, nothing can be born again. But people call this time we have\r\nnow reached the Renaissance, the born-again time. This is the reason\r\nwhy they call it that.\r\n\r\nYou remember the Age of Pericles, don’t you? when such beautiful\r\nsculptures and buildings were made in Athens. Well, in the fifteen\r\nhundreds not every one was rushing off to the New World in search of\r\nadventure. While the discoveries that I have told you about were taking\r\nplace, there were living and working in Italy some of the greatest\r\nartists the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nArchitects built beautiful buildings something like the old Greek and\r\nRoman temples. Sculptors made statues that were almost as beautiful as\r\nthose of Phidias. People began to take an interest once more in the old\r\nGreek writers, whose books were now printed for every one to read. It\r\nseemed almost as if Athens in the Age of Pericles had been born again.\r\nSo that is why people speak of this time as the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of these artists of the Renaissance was a man\r\nnamed Michelangelo. But Michelangelo was not just a painter; he was\r\na sculptor, an architect, and a poet as well. Michelangelo thought\r\nnothing of spending years working on any statue or painting that he was\r\ndoing. But when he had finished he had done something that people now\r\ngo from all over the world to see.\r\n\r\nNowadays, sculptors first model a statue in clay and then copy it in\r\nstone or cast it in bronze, but Michelangelo did not do this. He cut\r\nhis figures directly out of the stone, without making a model first. It\r\nwas as if he saw the figure imprisoned in the stone and then cut away\r\nthe part that closed the figure in.\r\n\r\nA large block of marble had been spoiled by another sculptor.\r\nMichelangelo saw a figure of David _in_ it, and, setting to work, he\r\ncut this young athlete _out_.\r\n\r\nHe made also a statue of Moses sitting down. It is now in a church in\r\nRome, and when you walk up to it it is so lifelike that it seems as if\r\nyou were in the presence of the prophet Moses himself. The guide tells\r\nyou that when Michelangelo had finished this statue of Moses he was so\r\nthrilled by the figure he had created that, feeling it must come to\r\nlife, he struck it on the knee with his hammer and commanded as he did\r\nso, “Stand Up”! And then the guide shows you a crack in the marble to\r\nprove that the story is true!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Michelangelo at work.]\r\n\r\nThe pope wanted Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of his own private\r\nchapel in Rome. This was called the Sistine Chapel. At first\r\nMichelangelo didn’t want to do the painting. He told the pope he was a\r\nsculptor and not a painter. But the pope insisted, and Michelangelo at\r\nlast gave in. Once having agreed to do the work, however, Michelangelo\r\ngave himself heart and soul to it.\r\n\r\nFor four years he lived in this room--the Sistine Chapel--and hardly\r\never left it day or night. Beneath the ceiling, he built himself a\r\nplatform, and, lying on this scaffold, he would read poetry and the\r\nBible and work “as the spirit moved him.” Locking himself in, he would\r\nlet no one enter, not even the pope himself. He wanted to be alone and\r\nto be left alone.\r\n\r\nThe pope, however, felt that he was a privileged character, and one\r\nday, when he found the door left open, he came into the chapel to see\r\nhow things were getting along. Michelangelo, thereupon, accidentally\r\ndropped some of his tools, and they just barely missed hitting the pope\r\non the head. The pope was very angry, but he never returned uninvited\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPeople now go from all over the world to see this ceiling, which only\r\ncan be viewed comfortably by lying on the floor or by looking at it in\r\na mirror.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo lived to be nearly ninety years old, yet he had very\r\nlittle to do with people. He could not stand being bored by them. So he\r\nlived apart in the company of the gods and angels that he painted.\r\n\r\nRaphael was another famous Italian artist. He lived at the same time as\r\nMichelangelo. Raphael, however, was just the opposite of Michelangelo\r\nin most ways. Michelangelo liked to be by himself. Raphael loved\r\ncompany. He was very popular and constantly surrounded by his friends\r\nand admirers, for everybody loved him on account of his genius and\r\nkindly nature. Young men swarmed about him, drinking in his words and\r\nhumbly copying everything he did. He had fifty or more pupils studying\r\nand painting under him, and they went along with him whenever he went\r\nout even for a walk. They almost worshiped the ground he walked on.\r\n\r\nRaphael painted many beautiful pictures of the Virgin Mary with the\r\ninfant Jesus. These were called Madonnas. Madonnas were almost the only\r\nkind of pictures that artists painted at that time. Raphael painted\r\none especially beautiful picture of Mary and the Christ-child called\r\nthe “Sistine Madonna.” This is considered one of the twelve greatest\r\npictures in the world. It was painted for a little church, but it is\r\nnow in a great picture-gallery, where it has a whole room to itself. No\r\nother pictures are thought worthy to have a place close by.\r\n\r\nRaphael died when he was still a young man, but he worked so hard and\r\nso continuously that he has left a large number of pictures. He painted\r\nonly the very important parts of his pictures himself--perhaps only the\r\nfaces. The body and hands and clothing he usually left to be painted\r\nby his pupils. They were glad to be allowed to do even a finger of a\r\npainting on which their master had worked.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo’s paintings were strong and forcible as a man is supposed\r\nto be. Raphael’s paintings were sweet and lovely and graceful, as a\r\nwoman is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci is another great artist who lived at this time. He\r\nwas left-handed, yet he could do any number of things exceptionally\r\nwell. He would be called a jack of all trades, but unlike most jacks\r\nof all trades, he was good at all. He was an artist, an engineer, a\r\npoet, and a scientist. It is said that he drew the first map of the\r\nNew World that had the name of America on it. He made, however, very\r\nfew paintings, because he did so many things beside, but these few\r\npictures are extremely beautiful. One of these is “The Last Supper.” It\r\nis considered, as is the “Sistine Madonna,” one of the twelve greatest\r\npaintings in the world. Unfortunately, it was painted directly on a\r\nplastered wall, and in the course of time much of the plaster with the\r\npaint has peeled off, so that there is little now left of the original\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nLeonardo usually painted his women smiling. One of his most famous\r\npaintings is the picture of a woman called “Mona Lisa.” She has a smile\r\nthat is called “quizzical.” You can hardly tell whether she is smiling\r\n_at_ you or _with_ you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\nChristians Quarrel\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people say young boys and girls can’t understand this chapter.\r\nThey say it is too difficult. But I want to see if it is.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, as I have told you before, there had been only one\r\nChristian religion--the Catholic. There was no Episcopalian, nor\r\nMethodist, nor Baptist, nor Presbyterian, nor any other denomination.\r\nAll were just Christians.\r\n\r\nBut in the sixteenth century some people began to think that changes\r\nshould be made in the Catholic religion.\r\n\r\nOthers thought changes should not be made.\r\n\r\nSome said it was all right as it was.\r\n\r\nOthers said it wasn’t all right as it was. So a quarrel started.\r\n\r\nThis is the way the trouble began: The pope was building a great church\r\ncalled St. Peter’s in Rome. It took the place of the old church that\r\nConstantine had built on the spot where St. Peter was supposed to have\r\nbeen crucified head down. The pope wanted it to be the largest and\r\nfinest church in the world, for Christ had said, “Thou art Peter, and\r\nupon this rock [Peter means rock in Latin] I will build my church....”\r\nSo the Church of St. Peter’s was to be the Capitol of the Christian\r\nreligion. Both Michelangelo and Raphael had worked on the plans for the\r\nnew church. In order to get marble and stone and other materials for\r\nthis Church of St. Peter, the pope did as others before him had done;\r\nhe tore down other buildings in Rome and used their stone for the new\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nBut besides all this the pope needed an enormous amount of money to\r\nbuild such a magnificent church as he had planned. So he started to\r\ncollect from the people. Now, there was a man in Germany named Martin\r\nLuther who was a monk and a teacher of religion in a college. Martin\r\nLuther thought that not only this but also other things in the Catholic\r\nChurch were not right. So he made a list of ninety-five things that\r\nhe thought were not right and nailed them up on the church door in\r\nthe town where he lived, and he preached against doing these things.\r\nThe pope sent Luther an order, but Luther made a bonfire and burned\r\nit publicly. Many took sides with Luther, and before long there was a\r\ngreat body of people who had left the Catholic Church and no longer\r\nobeyed the pope.\r\n\r\nThe pope called on the king of Spain to help in this quarrel with\r\nLuther. The reason he called on him was this: The king of Spain was\r\nCharles V, the grandson of the Ferdinand and Isabella who had helped\r\nColumbus. He was not only a good Catholic but the most powerful ruler\r\nin Europe. The Spanish explorers had discovered different parts of\r\nAmerica, and so Charles was owner of a large part of the New World. But\r\nhe was emperor not only of these Spanish settlements in America but of\r\nAustria and of Germany as well. So it was quite natural that the pope\r\nshould go to Charles for help.\r\n\r\nCharles commanded Luther to come to a city named Worms to be tried. He\r\npromised Luther that no harm would be done him, and so Luther went.\r\nWhen Luther arrived at Worms, Charles ordered him to take back all he\r\nhad said. Luther refused to do so. Some of Charles’s nobles said Luther\r\nshould be burned at the stake. But Charles, as he had promised, let him\r\ngo and did not punish him for his belief. Luther’s friends were afraid,\r\nthough, that other Catholics might do him harm. They knew Luther would\r\ntake no care of himself, and so they themselves took him prisoner and\r\nkept him shut up for over a year, so that no one could harm him. While\r\nLuther was in prison he translated the Bible into German; it was the\r\nfirst time that the Bible had been written in that language.\r\n\r\nThe people who protested against what the pope did were called\r\nProtest-ants, and those Christians who are not Roman Catholics are\r\nstill called Protestants to-day. The time when these changes were made\r\nin the Catholic form of worship was called the Re-form-ation, as the\r\nold religion was _re-formed_.\r\n\r\nNow, you may be a Catholic and your best friend may not be a Catholic,\r\nbut that makes no difference in your friendship. But at that time those\r\nwho were Catholics were deadly enemies of those who were not. Each side\r\nwas sure it alone was right and the other side was wrong. Each side\r\nfought for the things it thought were right, fought the other side as\r\nfuriously and madly and bitterly as if the other side were scoundrels\r\nand devils. Friends and relatives murdered each other because they\r\nthought differently about religion, and yet all were supposed to be\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nCharles was greatly worried and troubled by the religious quarrels\r\nand other difficulties in his vast empire. He became sick and tired\r\nof being emperor and of having to settle all the many problems he had\r\nto solve. He wanted to be free to do other things that he was more\r\ninterested in. Being king did not mean being able to do whatever you\r\nwanted, as some people think. So Charles did what few rulers have ever\r\ndone voluntarily: he resigned--“abdicated,” as it is called--and gave\r\nup his throne to his son, who was named Philip II.\r\n\r\nThen Charles, glad to be rid of all the cares of state, went to live in\r\na monastery. There he spent his time doing what he liked--what do you\r\nsuppose?--making mechanical toys and watches--until he died!\r\n\r\nNow, the king of England at this time, when Charles was king of Spain,\r\nwas Henry VIII. His last name was Tudor. So many kings had first names\r\nwhich were alike that such names were numbered to tell which Charles or\r\nHenry was meant and how many of the same name there had been before.\r\nHenry VIII was at first also a strong Catholic, and the pope had called\r\nhim Defender of the Faith. But Henry had a wife whom he wanted to get\r\nrid of because she had no son. In order to get rid of her so that he\r\nmight marry again, he had to have what was called a divorce, and the\r\npope was the only one who could give Henry a divorce. Now, the pope at\r\nRome was head of the Christian Church of the whole world and said what\r\nChristians could do or could not do, no matter whether they were in\r\nItaly or Spain or England. So Henry asked the pope to grant him this\r\ndivorce. The pope, however, told him he would not give him a divorce.\r\n\r\nNow, Henry thought it was neither right nor proper that a man in\r\nanother country, even if he _were_ pope, should say what could be done\r\nin England. He himself was ruler, and he didn’t intend to let any\r\nforeigner meddle in his affairs or give him orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn.]\r\n\r\nSo then Henry said that he himself would be head of all the Christians\r\nin England; then he could do as he wished without the pope’s\r\npermission. So he made himself head, and then he divorced his wife.\r\nAll the churches in England were now told by the king what they should\r\ndo; the pope no longer had anything to say in the matter; the English\r\nchurches obeyed the king, not the pope. This made the second big break\r\nin the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nAfter this Henry VIII had five other wives, six in all; not of course\r\nall at one time, for Christians could only have one wife at a time. His\r\nfirst wife he divorced, the second he beheaded, the third died. The\r\nsame thing happened to his last three wives: the first he divorced, the\r\nsecond he beheaded, and the third died--but Henry died before she did.\r\n\r\nIs this too difficult for you to understand?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64\r\n\r\nKing Elizabeth\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Henry VIII had two daughters.\r\n\r\nOne was named Mary, and one was named Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nTheir last name was of course Tudor, the same as their father’s,\r\nalthough we do not usually think of kings and queens as having last\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nKing Henry had a son, also, and he was first to become king after his\r\nfather died, for though he was younger than his sisters, a boy was\r\nsupposed to be more fit to rule than a girl. But he didn’t live long,\r\nand then Mary was the first of the two sisters to become queen.\r\n\r\n“Mary, Mary, quite contrary” did not approve what her father had done\r\nwhen he turned against the pope and the Catholic Church. Mary herself\r\nwas a strong Catholic and ready to fight for the pope and the Catholic\r\nChurch. In fact, she wanted to have all who were not Catholics, all\r\nthose who were Protestants, put to death. She thought that all those\r\nwho did not believe as she did were wicked and should be killed. Like\r\nthe queen in “Alice in Wonderland,” she was always saying, “Off with\r\nhis head!” This seems to us very unchristian, but in those days their\r\nideas about such things were peculiar. Mary had the heads of so many\r\npeople cut off that she was called Bloody Mary.\r\n\r\nMary married a man who was just as strong a Catholic as she and even\r\n“bloodier.” He was not an Englishman, but a Spaniard, Philip II of\r\nSpain, son of Charles V, who had abdicated.\r\n\r\nPhilip II was much sterner than his father had been. Philip tried\r\nto make those who were Protestants, or who were supposed to be\r\nProtestants, confess and give up Protestantism. If they did not do so,\r\nthey were tortured as the old Christian martyrs had been tortured. This\r\nwas called the Inquisition. Those suspected of being Protestants were\r\ntormented in all sorts of horrible ways. Some were tied up in the air\r\nby their hands, like a picture hung on the wall, until they fainted\r\nfrom the pain or else confessed what they were told to confess. Some\r\nwere stretched on a rack, their heads pulled one way and their legs\r\nthe opposite way, until their bodies were nearly torn apart. Those who\r\nwere found guilty of being Protestants were killed outright, burned to\r\ndeath, or put slowly to death, so that they would suffer longer.\r\n\r\nThe people whom Philip chiefly persecuted were the Dutch people in\r\nHolland. Holland then belonged to his empire, and a great many of the\r\nDutch people had become Protestants.\r\n\r\nNow, there was a Dutchman called William the Silent, because he talked\r\nlittle but did a great deal. William was furious at the way his people\r\nwere treated. So he fought against Philip and at last succeeded in\r\nmaking his country free and setting up the Dutch Republic. But William\r\nthe Silent was murdered by order of Philip.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s the kind of man Bloody Mary had for a husband.\r\n\r\nAfter Mary Tudor died, her sister, Elizabeth Tudor, became queen,\r\nthough she ruled like a king. Elizabeth had red hair and was very vain\r\nand loved to be flattered. She had many lovers but she never married,\r\nand as a woman who never marries is called a virgin she was known as\r\nthe Virgin Queen.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was a Protestant and was just as bitter against the Catholics\r\nas her sister and her sister’s husband had been against the Protestants.\r\n\r\nA relative of Elizabeth was queen of Scotland. Scotland was a country\r\nnorth of England, but at that time it was not a part of England, and\r\nits queen was named Mary Stuart. Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, was\r\nyoung, beautiful, and fascinating; but she was a Catholic, and so\r\nElizabeth and she were enemies.\r\n\r\nElizabeth heard that Mary Stuart was trying to become queen of England\r\nas well as Scotland, so she had her, although a relative, put in\r\nprison. In prison Mary Stuart stayed for nearly twenty years and was\r\nthen at last put to death by Elizabeth’s orders. It is hard for us to\r\nunderstand how any one could have his own relatives killed in this\r\ncold-blooded way, especially any one who pretended to be a Christian,\r\nbut in those times it was a very common custom, as we see when we\r\nhear of so many murders committed by the rulers of the people. Philip\r\nII, the great champion of the Catholics, made up his mind to punish\r\nElizabeth, his sister-in-law, for killing such a good Catholic as Mary\r\nStuart.\r\n\r\nSo he got together a large navy of very fine ships called the Spanish\r\nArmada. All Spain was very proud of this fleet. It was boastfully\r\ncalled the Invincible Armada; “invincible” means “unconquerable.”\r\n\r\nThis Invincible Armada set forth in 1588 to conquer the English navy.\r\nLined up in the shape of a half-moon, the ships sailed grandly toward\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe English fleet was composed only of little boats. But instead of\r\ngoing out to meet the Armada in regular sea-battle as the Spaniards\r\nexpected, the English ships sailed out and attacked the Spanish ships\r\nfrom behind and fought one ship at a time. The English were better\r\nfighters, and their small boats were quicker and more easily managed.\r\nThey could strike a blow and get away before a Spanish ship could turn\r\naround into position to fire. So gradually they sank or destroyed the\r\nbig Spanish boats one by one.\r\n\r\nThen the English set some old boats afire and started them drifting\r\ntoward the Spanish fleet. As all boats at that time were of course\r\nmade of wood, the Spaniards became frightened at these burning piles\r\ndrifting down upon them, and part of the fleet sailed away. The rest\r\ntried to get back to Spain by sailing the long way round, north of\r\nScotland. But a terrible storm struck them, and almost all the boats\r\nwere shipwrecked, and thousands of dead bodies were washed up on shore.\r\nSo the great Spanish Armada was destroyed, and with it ended the power\r\nof Spain at sea. She was no longer the great nation she had been.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, the largest and most powerful\r\ncountry in the world was Spain; at the end of her reign it was England\r\nthat was the most powerful. Ever since then her fleet, which King\r\nAlfred started far back, has been the largest, and the saying is,\r\n“Britannia rules the waves.”\r\n\r\nPeople at that time thought it impossible for a woman to rule as well\r\nas a man, but under Elizabeth’s rule England in turn became the leading\r\ncountry of Europe. Then people said Elizabeth ruled _like_ a man, that\r\nshe had a man’s brain, a man’s will. In fact they said she was more man\r\nthan woman--that she was a tomboy grown up--that’s why I call her “King\r\nElizabeth.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65\r\n\r\nThe Age of Elizabeth\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story is about the Age of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMy father always told me that it was impolite to talk about a lady’s\r\nage.\r\n\r\nBut I’m not going to tell you how old Elizabeth was, though she did\r\nlive and reign a great many years.\r\n\r\nI’m going to tell you some of the things that happened during her\r\nlong life, for the time when she lived is what is called the Age of\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nThere was a young man named Raleigh living when Elizabeth became queen.\r\nOne day when it was raining and the streets were muddy, Elizabeth\r\nwas about to cross the street. Raleigh saw her and, to keep her from\r\nsoiling her shoes, ran forward, took off his beautiful velvet cape, and\r\nthrew it in the puddle where she was about to step, so that she might\r\ncross upon it as upon a carpet. The queen was greatly pleased with this\r\nthoughtful and gentlemanly act, and she made him a knight, so that he\r\nwas then called Sir Walter Raleigh, and ever after that he was one of\r\nher special friends.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh was much interested in the new country of America.\r\nCabot had claimed a great part of it for England almost a hundred\r\nyears before, but England had done nothing about it. Raleigh thought\r\nsomething should be done about it; he thought English people should\r\nsettle there, so that other countries like Spain, which had made so\r\nmany settlements in America, would not get ahead of England. So Raleigh\r\ngot together several companies of English people and sent them over to\r\nan island called Roanoke, which was just off the coast of the present\r\nState of North Carolina. At that time, however, almost the whole coast\r\nof the United States as far north as Canada was called Virginia. It had\r\nbeen named Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nSome of these Roanoke colonists became discouraged with the hardships\r\nthey had to suffer and so gave up and sailed back home again. Those\r\nwho remained all disappeared. Where? No one knows. We think they must\r\neither have been killed by the Indians or have died of starvation.\r\nAt any rate, not one was left to tell the tale. Among these Roanoke\r\ncolonists was the first English child born in America--a girl, who had\r\nbeen named Virginia Dare, for the queen was very popular and a great\r\nmany girls were named Virginia after her.\r\n\r\nSome tobacco was brought back from Virginia, and Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nlearned to smoke. This was such a strange and unknown thing at that\r\ntime that one day while he was smoking a pipe a servant who saw smoke\r\ncoming out of his mouth thought he was on fire and, running for a\r\nbucket of water, emptied it over his head.\r\n\r\nVirginia is still famous for its tobacco. At first tobacco was supposed\r\nto be very healthful, for the Indians seemed to have very good health\r\nand they smoked a great deal. Afterward, however, in the next reign,\r\nKing James so hated tobacco that he wrote a book against it and forbade\r\nit to be used.\r\n\r\nAfter Queen Elizabeth had died, Raleigh was put in prison, for it\r\nwas said he was plotting against the new king James, who came after\r\nElizabeth. The prison where he was placed was the Tower of London, the\r\nold castle that William the Conqueror had built. Here Raleigh was kept\r\nfor thirteen long years, and to pass the time away he wrote a “History\r\nof the World.” But at last he was put to death as many other great men\r\nwere also.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there lived the great writer of\r\nplays, the greatest writer the world has ever known. This man was\r\nWilliam Shakspere.\r\n\r\nShakspere’s father could not write his name. Shakspere himself spent\r\nonly six years at school. As a boy he was rather wild, and he was\r\narrested for hunting deer in the forest of Sir Thomas Lucy at Stratford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shakspere reading to Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nWhen still a boy Shakspere married a girl older than himself named Anne\r\nHathaway. After he had been married a few years he left her and their\r\nthree children, left the little town of Stratford, and went up to the\r\ngreat city of London to seek his fortune. There Shakspere got a job\r\nworking around a theater, holding the horses of those who came to see\r\nthe plays. Then he got a chance to act in the theater, and he became an\r\nactor, but he did not become a very good one.\r\n\r\nIn those days the theaters had no scenery. A sign was put up to tell\r\nwhat the scene was supposed to be. For instance, instead of forest\r\nscenery, they would put up a sign saying, “This is a forest,” or\r\ninstead of a room scene a sign saying “This is a room in an inn.” There\r\nwere no actresses. Men and boys took the parts of both men and women.\r\n\r\nShakspere was asked to change some of the plays that had already been\r\nwritten, so that they could be better acted. He did this very well;\r\nthen he started in to write plays himself. Usually he took old stories\r\nand made them into plays, but he did it so wonderfully well that they\r\nare better than any plays that have ever been written before or since.\r\n\r\nThough Shakspere left school when only thirteen years old, he seems to\r\nhave had a remarkable knowledge of almost everything under the sun. He\r\nshows in his plays that he knew about history and law and medicine,\r\nand he knew and used more words than almost any writer who has ever\r\nlived. Indeed, some people say that with the little education he had,\r\nhe could not possibly have written the plays himself, and so they have\r\ntried to prove that some one else must have written them. Some of the\r\ngreatest of Shakspere’s plays are “Hamlet,” “The Merchant of Venice,”\r\n“Romeo and Juliet,” and “Julius Cæsar.”\r\n\r\nShakspere made a good deal of money for those times--almost a fortune.\r\nThen he left London and went back to live in the little town of\r\nStratford where he was born. Here at last he died and was buried in\r\nthe village church. People wanted to move his body to a greater and\r\nhandsomer place, to a famous church in London. But some one, perhaps\r\nShakspere himself, had written a verse which was carved on his\r\ntombstone. The last line of this verse said, “And curst be he who moves\r\nmy bones”; so they never were moved, for no one dared to move them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66\r\n\r\n  James the Servant\r\n  or\r\n  What’s In a Name?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does your name mean?\r\n\r\n  If it is\r\n    Baker or\r\n      Miller or\r\n        Taylor or\r\n          Carpenter or\r\n            Fisher or\r\n              Cook,\r\n\r\nit means that at some time one of your ancestors was a\r\n\r\n  baker, or\r\n    miller, or\r\n      tailor, or\r\n        carpenter, or\r\n          fisher, or\r\n            cook.\r\n\r\nIf your name is Stuart or Steuart or Stewart or Steward, it means that\r\nat some time one of your ancestors was a steward for in olden days\r\npeople knew very little about spelling, and they spelled the same name\r\nin different ways. A steward was a chief servant.\r\n\r\nThere was a family named Stuart in Scotland, and from chief servants\r\nor stewards they had become rulers of the Scots. Mary Stuart, whom\r\nElizabeth had beheaded, was one of them.\r\n\r\nAs Queen Elizabeth never married, she had no children to rule after\r\nher. She was the last of the Tudor family. So the English had to look\r\naround for a new king, and they looked to Scotland.\r\n\r\nNow, Scotland, as I have told you, was then a separate country and\r\nnot a part of England as now. The son of Mary Stuart was then king of\r\nScotland. His name was James Stuart. As he was related to the Tudors,\r\nthe English invited him to come and rule over them. He accepted the\r\ninvitation and was called James I. So we speak of his reign and that of\r\nhis children as the reign of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe Stuart family reigned for about a hundred years, that is, from 1600\r\nto 1700, all except about eleven years when England had no king at all.\r\n\r\nMany times the English must have been very sorry that they had ever\r\ninvited James to be their king, for he and the whole Stuart family\r\nlorded it over the English people. They acted as if they were “lords of\r\ncreation,” and the English people had to fight for their rights.\r\n\r\nA body of men called Parliament were supposed to make the laws for the\r\nEnglish people. But James said that Parliament could do nothing that he\r\ndidn’t like, and if they weren’t very careful he wouldn’t let them do\r\nany governing at all. James said that whatever the king did was right,\r\nthat the king could do no wrong, that God gave kings the right to do as\r\nthey pleased with their subjects. This was called the Divine Right of\r\nKings. Naturally the English people would not put up with this sort of\r\nthing. Ever since the time of King John they had insisted on their own\r\nrights. The Tudors had often done things that the people didn’t like,\r\nbut the Tudors were English. The Stuarts, however, were Scotch, and\r\nthe people looked on them as foreigners; what they permitted in one of\r\ntheir own family they wouldn’t stand in these strangers whom they had\r\ninvited into their family. So, of course, a quarrel was bound to start.\r\nBut the real fight came with the next king and not with James.\r\n\r\nJames was very fond of beefsteak, and one particular cut from the loin\r\nof beef he liked especially well. It was so delicious he thought it\r\nshould be honored in some way, and so he made it a knight as if it were\r\na brave and gallant gentleman and dubbed it “Sir Loin,” which we still\r\ncall it to-day--although people have forgotten all about how it got\r\nsuch a name, and some even say this is only a story and that he never\r\ndid such a foolish thing, anyway.\r\n\r\nDuring King James’s reign the Bible was translated into English. This\r\nis probably the same Bible you read and that is called the King James\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nNothing much happened in England during James’s reign, but in some\r\nother countries a great deal did happen, although the king had little\r\nto do with it. English people made settlements in India, that far away\r\ncountry of the Brahmanists, which Columbus had tried to reach by going\r\nwest; and these settlements there grew until India at last belonged to\r\nEngland. The English made settlements also in America, and these grew\r\nuntil at last part of America, too, belonged to England.\r\n\r\nOne of these settlements in America was made in the South, and one was\r\nmade in the North. Raleigh’s settlement at Roanoke had disappeared, as\r\nI told you; but in 1607 a boatload of English gentlemen sailed over\r\nto America looking for adventure and hoping to make their fortunes by\r\nfinding gold. They landed in Virginia and named the place where they\r\nsettled Jamestown after their king, James. But they found no gold, and\r\nas they were not used to work, they didn’t want to do any. But their\r\nleader, Captain John Smith, took matters in hand and said that those\r\nthat didn’t work shouldn’t eat. So then the colonists had to go to work.\r\n\r\nBack in England people had learned to smoke, and so the colonists\r\nbegan to raise tobacco for the English people. The tobacco brought\r\nthe colonists so much money that it proved to be a gold-mine--of a\r\ndifferent kind--after all. But the colonial gentlemen wanted some one\r\nto do the rough work for them. So a few years later some negroes were\r\nbrought over from Africa and sold to the colonists as slaves to do the\r\nrough work. This was the beginning of slavery in America, which grew\r\nand grew until in the South almost all the work was done by colored\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nA little later another company of people left England for America.\r\nThese people were not looking for fortunes, however, as the Jamestown\r\nsettlers had been. They were looking for a place where they might\r\nworship God as they pleased, for in England they were interfered\r\nwith, and they wanted to find a place where no one would interfere\r\nwith them. So this company of people left England in 1620 in a ship\r\ncalled the _Mayflower_ sailed across the ocean and landed in a place\r\ncalled Plymouth, in Massachusetts, and there they settled. More than\r\nhalf of them died the first winter from hardship and exposure in the\r\nbitter weather that they have in the North, but, nevertheless, none of\r\nthose who were left would go back to England. This settlement was the\r\nbeginning of that part of the United States called New England. You\r\nwill hear more about both settlements later when you study American\r\nHistory. But at present we must see what was going on in England, for\r\nthere were great “goings on” there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\nA King Who Lost His Head\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever sung, “King William was King James’ son”?\r\n\r\nWell, that must have been some other King James, for King Charles was\r\nthis King James’ son, and he was Charles I.\r\n\r\nCharles was “a chip of the old block.” Like his father he believed in\r\nthe Divine Right of Kings, that he alone had the right to say what\r\nshould be done or what should not be done, and he treated the English\r\npeople as King John had; that is, as if they were made simply to serve\r\nhis pleasure and to do as he said.\r\n\r\nBut this time the people didn’t carry him off, as they had King John,\r\nto agree to a paper. They started to fight. The king made ready to\r\nfight for what he thought his rights. So he got together an army of\r\nlords and nobles and those who agreed with him. Those who took his side\r\neven dressed differently from those who were against him. They grew\r\ntheir hair in long curls and wore a broad-brimmed hat with a large\r\nfeather and lace collars and cuffs of lace even on their breeches.\r\n\r\nParliament also got together an army of the people who wanted their\r\nrights. They had their hair cut short and wore a hat with a tall crown\r\nand very simple clothes. A country gentleman named Oliver Cromwell\r\ntrained a regiment of soldiers to be such good fighters that they were\r\ncalled Ironsides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King Charles and Oliver Cromwell.]\r\n\r\nThe king’s army was made up of men who prepared for battle by drinking\r\nand feasting. The parliamentary army prayed before going into battle\r\nand sang hymns and psalms as they marched.\r\n\r\nAt last after many battles the king’s army was beaten and King Charles\r\nwas taken prisoner. A small part of Parliament then took things in\r\ntheir own hands, and though they had no right to do so they tried King\r\nCharles and condemned him to death. They found him guilty of being a\r\ntraitor and a murderer and other terrible things. Then he was taken\r\nout in front of his palace in London in the year 1649 and his head\r\nwas cut off. People now feel that this was a shameful thing for the\r\nparliamentary army to do to the king, and even at that time only a part\r\nof the English people were in favor of it. He might have been sent away\r\ninstead of being killed, or he might have had his office of king taken\r\naway from him.\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell, the commander of the parliamentary army then ruled\r\nover England for a few years. He was a coarse-looking person with\r\nvery rough manners, but honest and religious, and he ruled England as\r\na stern and strict father might rule his family. He would stand no\r\nnonsense. Once when he was having his picture painted--for there were\r\nno photographs then--the artist left out a big wart he had on his face.\r\nCromwell angrily told him, “Paint me as I am, wart and all.” Cromwell\r\nwas really a king although he called himself Protector, but he did a\r\ngreat deal that was good for England.\r\n\r\nWhen Cromwell died his son became ruler after him, just as if he were\r\nthe son of a king, but the son was unable to fill his father’s shoes.\r\nHe meant well, but he hadn’t the brains or the ability that his father\r\nhad, and so in a few months he resigned. Oliver Cromwell had been so\r\nstrict that the English people had forgotten about their troubles under\r\nthe Stuarts. So in 1660 when the English found themselves without a\r\nruler they invited back the son of Charles I, whom they had beheaded,\r\nand once more a Stuart became king. This was Charles II.\r\n\r\nCharles was called the Merry Monarch because all he seemed to think\r\nabout was eating and drinking, amusing himself, and having a good time.\r\nHe made fun of things that were holy and sacred. To revenge himself on\r\nthose who had put his father to death he had those of them who were\r\nstill living killed in the most horrible way one could think of. Those\r\nthat were dead already, Oliver Cromwell among them, were taken from\r\ntheir tombs; then their dead bodies were hung and afterward beheaded.\r\n\r\nIn his reign that old and terrible disease, the plague, broke loose\r\nagain in London. Some people thought that God had caused it, that\r\nHe was shocked by the behavior of the king and his people especially\r\ntoward holy things, that He was punishing them. The next year, 1666, a\r\ngreat fire started and burned up thousands of houses, and hundreds of\r\nchurches were destroyed. But the Great Fire, as it was called, cleaned\r\nup the disease and dirt and was therefore really a blessing. London had\r\nbeen a city of wooden houses. It was rebuilt of brick and stone.\r\n\r\nOnly one more Stuart ruler shall I tell you about--or rather a royal\r\npair, William and Mary--because in their reign the fight between the\r\npeople and their kings was once for all finally settled. In 1688\r\nParliament drew up an agreement called the Declaration of Right, which\r\nWilliam and Mary signed. This agreement made Parliament ruler over the\r\nnation, and ever since, Parliament and not the king has been the real\r\nruler of England. So I think we have heard enough of the Stuarts for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68\r\n\r\nRed Cap and Red Heels\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last Louis I told you about was a saint--the Louis who went on the\r\nlast Crusade.\r\n\r\nThe two Louis I’m going to tell you about now were not saints--not by\r\nany means.\r\n\r\nThey were Louis XIII and Louis XIV and they ruled France while the\r\nStuarts were reigning in the seventeenth century in England.\r\n\r\nLouis XIII was king in name only. Another man told him what to do,\r\nand he did it. Strange to say, this other man was a great ruler of\r\nthe church called a cardinal, who wore a red cap and a red gown. The\r\ncardinal’s name was Richelieu.\r\n\r\nNow, you are probably sick and tired of hearing about wars, but during\r\nthe reign of Louis XIII another long war started, and I must tell\r\nyou something about it for it lasted thirty years. It was therefore\r\ncalled the Thirty Years’ War. It was different from most wars. It was\r\nnot a war of one country against another. It was a war between the\r\nProtestants and Catholics.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu was of course a Catholic and the real ruler of\r\nFrance, which was a Catholic country. Nevertheless, he took sides with\r\nthe Protestants, for they were fighting a Catholic country called\r\nAustria, and he wanted to beat Austria. Most of the countries in Europe\r\ntook part in this war, but Germany was the battle-ground where most of\r\nthe fighting was done. Even Sweden, a northern country of Europe which\r\nwe have not heard of before, took part. The king of Sweden at this time\r\nwas named Gustavus Adolphus, and he was called the Snow King because he\r\nwas king of such a cold country, and also the Lion of the North, for\r\nhe was such a brave fighter. I am mentioning him particularly because\r\nof all kings and rulers in Europe at this time he was the finest\r\ncharacter. Indeed, most of the other rulers thought only of themselves,\r\nand they would lie and cheat and steal and even murder to get what\r\nthey wanted, but Gustavus Adolphus was fighting for what he thought\r\nwas right. Gustavus Adolphus was a Protestant, and so he came down\r\ninto Germany and fought on the side of the Protestants. He was a great\r\ngeneral, and his army won. But unfortunately he himself was at last\r\nkilled in battle. The Protestants came out ahead in the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, and at last a famous treaty of peace was made called the Treaty of\r\nWestphalia. By this treaty it was agreed that each country should have\r\nwhatever religion its ruler had; it could be Protestant or Catholic as\r\nthe ruler wished.\r\n\r\nDuring the Thirty Years’ War the plague, that old deadly contagious\r\ndisease we have heard of before, broke out in Germany. A little town\r\nnamed Oberammergau prayed that it might be spared. The townspeople\r\nvowed that if they were spared they would give a play of Christ’s life\r\nonce every ten years. They _were_ spared, and so every ten years, ever\r\nsince then, with only a few exceptions, they have been giving what is\r\ncalled the Passion Play. As it is the only place in the world where it\r\nis ever given, tens of thousands of Christians from all over the globe\r\ntravel to this little out-of-the-way village to see these peasants act\r\nthe stories of Christ’s life. The play is given on Sundays during the\r\nsummer of the tenth year and lasts all day long. There are about seven\r\nhundred people who take part, half of all the people in the town. It\r\nis a great honor to be chosen to play the part of a saint; it is the\r\nhighest earthly honor to be selected to play the part of Christ; and it\r\nis a disgrace to be left out entirely.\r\n\r\nThe next French king to rule after Louis XIII and Richelieu was Louis\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nThe people in England had at last succeeded in getting the power to\r\nrule themselves through their Parliament. But in France Louis would\r\nlet no one rule but himself. He said, “I am the state,” and he would\r\nlet no one have a say in the government. This was the same as the\r\nStuarts’ Divine Right of Kings, which the English people had put an end\r\nto. Louis ruled for more than seventy years. This is the longest time\r\nthat any one in history has ever ruled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XIV.]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV was called the Grand Monarch, and everything he did was to\r\nshow off. He was always parading and strutting about as if he were\r\nthe leading character in a play and not just an ordinary human being.\r\nHe wore corsets and a huge powdered wig and shoes with very high red\r\nheels, to make himself appear taller. That, I suppose, is why some\r\nladies to-day wear high heels called French heels. He carried a long\r\ncane, stuck out his elbows, turned out his toes, and strutted up and\r\ndown, for he thought these things made him seem grand, important,\r\nimposing.\r\n\r\nAll this may sound as if Louis were a silly person with no sense, but\r\nyou must not get that idea. In spite of his absurd manners he made\r\nFrance the chief power in Europe. He was almost constantly fighting\r\nother countries, trying to increase the size of France and to add to\r\nhis kingdom, but I have already told you so much about so many fights,\r\nthat I’m not going to tell you any more about his just now, for you\r\nwould probably not read it if I did. So France had her turn as leader\r\nof all the other countries as Spain and England had had.\r\n\r\nLouis built a magnificent palace at Versailles in which were marble\r\nhalls, beautiful paintings, and many huge mirrors in which he could see\r\nhimself as he strutted along. The palace was surrounded by a park with\r\nwonderful fountains. The water for the fountains had to be brought a\r\nlong distance, and it cost thousands of dollars to have the fountains\r\nplay just for a few minutes. Even to-day sight-seers visit Versailles\r\nto see the magnificent palace rooms and to watch the fountains play.\r\n\r\nBut Louis surrounded himself not only with beautiful things. He also\r\nsurrounded himself with all the most interesting men and women of his\r\ntime. All those who could do anything exceptionally well, all those who\r\ncould paint well or write well or talk well or play well or look well,\r\nhe brought together to live with him or near by him. This was called\r\nhis _court_. Those in his Court were “in society.” They were the chosen\r\nfew who looked down on all the others who were not in society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XIV getting ready for bed.]\r\n\r\nThis was all very fine for the people who were lucky enough to be “in\r\nsociety”--in Louis’s court. But the poor people of France, those not in\r\nhis court, were the ones who had to pay Louis’s expenses and those of\r\nhis court. They were the ones who had to pay for his parties and balls\r\nand feasts and for all sorts of presents which he gave his friends. So\r\nwe shall see presently what happened. The poor people would not stand\r\nthat sort of thing forever. “The worm will turn,” we say.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69\r\n\r\nA Self-Made Man\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was the Father of His Country?\r\n\r\nI know what you will say:\r\n\r\n“George Washington.”\r\n\r\nBut there was another man called “The Father of His Country” before\r\nWashington was born, and he was not an American.\r\n\r\nIn the east of Europe there is a great country as large as our own,\r\nand its name is Russia. Very little had been heard of Russia before\r\nthe Year 1700, for although it was the largest country in Europe, its\r\npeople were only about half civilized. The Russians were a branch of\r\nthe great Aryan family called Slavs, but although they were white\r\npeople, they were living so close to the yellow people in China that\r\nthey had become much like them in many of their ways. Then, too, the\r\nterrible Genghis Khan and his yellow Mongols had conquered Russia\r\nin the thirteenth century and ruled over the land. So although the\r\nRussians were Christians, they were in every other way more like the\r\npeople of the East than like Europeans. The men had long beards and\r\nwore long coats. The women wore veils like those the Turkish women\r\nwore. The people counted with balls strung on wires as the Chinese did.\r\n\r\nWell, just before 1700 there was born a Russian prince named Peter.\r\nWhen a small boy, Peter was very much afraid of the water. But he felt\r\nso ashamed that he, a prince, should fear anything that he forced\r\nhimself to get used to the water. He would go to it and play in it and\r\nsail boats on it, although all the time he was almost scared to death.\r\nAnd so at last he not only got over this great fear but he came to like\r\nthe water and boats more than any other playthings.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter grew up the thing he wanted more than anything else in the\r\nworld was to make his country important in Europe, for before this time\r\nit had not been. It was big but not great. And his people had to be\r\ncivilized. But before he could teach his own people, who were most of\r\nthem very poor and ignorant, he had to learn himself. As there was no\r\none in Russia who could teach him what he wanted to know, he disguised\r\nhimself as a common laborer and went to the little country of Holland.\r\nHere he got a job in a shipbuilding yard and worked for several months,\r\ncooking his own food and mending his own clothes. While he was doing\r\nthis, however, he learned all about building ships and studied many\r\nother things besides, such as blacksmithing, cobbling shoes, and even\r\npulling teeth.\r\n\r\nThen he went to England, and everywhere he went he learned all he\r\ncould. At last he returned to his own country with the knowledge he had\r\ngained and set to work to make Russia over. First of all, Peter wanted\r\nRussia to have a fleet of ships as other nations had. But in order to\r\nhave a fleet he had to have water for his ships, and Russia had almost\r\nno land bordering on the water. So Peter planned to take a sea-shore\r\naway from the neighboring country of Sweden.\r\n\r\nNow the king of Sweden at this time was Charles. He was the twelfth\r\nking named Charles that Sweden had had. Charles XII was hardly more\r\nthan a boy, and Peter thought it would be an easy matter to beat\r\nthis boy and help himself to whatever land he wanted on the water.\r\nBut Charles was not an ordinary boy. He was an extra-ordinary boy,\r\nextra-ordinarily bright and gifted, and he had been unusually well\r\neducated besides. He knew several languages; he had learned to ride a\r\nhorse when he was four years old and how to hunt and to fight. Besides\r\nall this, he feared neither hardship nor danger. Indeed, he was such a\r\ndaredevil that people called him the Madman of the North. So at first\r\nPeter’s army was beaten by Charles.\r\n\r\nBut Peter took his beating calmly, simply remarking that Charles would\r\nsoon teach the Russian army how to win. Indeed, so successful was\r\nCharles at first in fighting Peter and all others who threatened him\r\nthat the countries of Europe began to think of him as Alexander the\r\nGreat come to life again, and they feared he might conquer them all.\r\nBut at last the Russians did win against Charles, and Peter got his\r\nsea-shore. Then Peter built the fleet for which he had been working and\r\nplanning for so many years.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Russia was Moscow. It was a beautiful city but near\r\nthe center of that country and far from the water. This didn’t suit\r\nPeter at all. Peter wanted a fine city for his capital, but he wanted\r\nit right on the water’s edge, so that he could have his beloved ships\r\nclose to him. So he picked out a spot not only on the water but mostly\r\nwater, for it was chiefly a marsh. Then he put a third of a million\r\npeople to work filling in the marsh, and on this he built a beautiful\r\ncity. This city he called St. Petersburg in honor of his patron\r\nsaint, the apostle Peter, after whom he himself had been named. The\r\nname of St. Petersburg was later changed to Petrograd and recently to\r\nLeningrad. Then Peter improved the laws, started schools, and built\r\nfactories and hospitals and taught his people arithmetic, so that they\r\ncould count without having to use balls strung on strings. He made\r\nhis people dress like other Europeans. He made the men cut off their\r\nlong beards, which he thought looked countrified. The men thought it\r\nindecent to have no beards so some saved them to be placed in their\r\ncoffins in order that at the day of resurrection they could appear\r\nbefore God unashamed. He introduced all sorts of things that he found\r\nin Europe but which were unknown in his own country, and he really made\r\nRussia over into a great European nation, so that is why he is called\r\nPeter the Great, the Father of his Country.\r\n\r\nPeter fell in love with a poor peasant girl, an orphan named Catherine,\r\nand married her. She had no education, but she was very sweet and\r\nlovely and bright and quick-witted, so the marriage turned out happily.\r\nThe Russians were shocked at the idea of having a queen who was not a\r\nprincess and was so low-born. But Peter had her crowned, and after he\r\ndied she ruled over Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\nA Prince Who Ran Away\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you put a P in front of Russia it makes--Prussia. This is the name\r\nof a little country in Europe, which is now a part of Germany. Russia\r\nwas big, and Peter made it great. Prussia was small, but another king\r\nmade it also great. This king was named Frederick. He, too, lived in\r\nthe eighteenth century, but a little later than Peter, and he, too, was\r\ncalled “the Great”--Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s father, who was the second king of Prussia, had a hobby for\r\ncollecting giants--as you might collect postage-stamps. Wherever he\r\nheard of a very tall man, no matter in what country and no matter what\r\nit cost to get him, he bought or hired him. This collection of giants\r\nhe made into a remarkable company of soldiers which was his special\r\npride.\r\n\r\nHe was a very cranky, cross, and bad-tempered old king. He treated his\r\nchildren terribly, especially his son Frederick, whom he called Fritz.\r\nFritz had curls and liked music and poetry and fancy clothes. And his\r\nfather thought he was growing up to be a girl-boy. This disgusted his\r\nfather, for he wanted a son who would be a soldier and fighter. His\r\nfather when angry used to throw dishes at him, lock him up for days\r\nat a time, and feed him on bread and water and whip him with a cane.\r\nFinally Fritz could stand it no longer, and he ran away. He was caught\r\nand brought back. His father was so angry with his son for disobeying\r\nand acting as he had done that he was actually going to have him\r\nkilled--yes, put to death--but at the last minute was persuaded not to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nBut here is a funny thing: When Fritz grew up to be Frederick, he\r\nturned out just what his father wanted him to be--a great soldier and\r\nfighter. He still loved poetry and even tried to write poems himself,\r\nand he was very fond of music and he played the flute very well,\r\nindeed. But Frederick wanted above everything else to make his country\r\nimportant in Europe; for before his time it was of little account, and\r\nno one paid much attention to it.\r\n\r\nNow, the neighboring country to Prussia was Austria. Austria was ruled\r\nover by a woman. This woman was named Maria Theresa. Maria Theresa had\r\nbecome ruler of Austria at the same time that Frederick had become king\r\nof Prussia. Some people thought a woman was not a fit person to rule\r\nover a country. Frederick’s father had promised to let Maria Theresa\r\nalone--he had promised not to fight a woman--but when Frederick became\r\nking he wanted to add a part of Austria to his own country, and so he\r\nsimply helped himself to the piece of Maria Theresa’s country that he\r\nwanted. He didn’t care if she was a woman or whether it was fair or\r\nnot. Of course this started a war. Before long almost every country in\r\nEurope was fighting either with Frederick or against him. But Frederick\r\nnot only succeeded in getting what he was after; he succeeded in\r\nholding on to it.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, however, would not give up. She wanted to get back what\r\nhad been wrongfully taken away from her. So she began quietly and\r\nsecretly to get ready for another war against Frederick. Quietly and\r\nsecretly she got other countries to promise to help her. But Frederick\r\nheard of what she was doing, and suddenly he attacked her again, and\r\nfor seven long years this next war went on. So this was called the\r\nSeven Years’ War. Frederick kept on fighting until he had beaten\r\nAustria for good and until he had gained his purpose, which was to make\r\nhis little country of Prussia the most powerful country in Europe.\r\nHe still held on to the part of Austria that he had at first taken\r\naway. Maria Theresa was a great queen, and she would have won against\r\nFrederick had he been an ordinary king. But she had too strong a ruler\r\nagainst her. Frederick was one of the world’s smartest generals and too\r\nmuch for her.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years’ War, strange to say, was fought out not only in\r\nEurope but in far-off America, also. England had taken Frederick’s\r\nside. France and other countries had taken sides against him. So the\r\nEnglish settlers in America, who were on Frederick’s side, fought the\r\nFrench settlers, who were against him. When, therefore, Frederick\r\nwon in Europe, the English in America also won against the French in\r\nAmerica. I am telling you all this because that is why we in America\r\nspeak English instead of French to-day. If Frederick had lost, France\r\nwould have won, and we here in America would probably now speak French\r\ninstead of English.\r\n\r\nFrederick, like some other kings we have heard of before, thought\r\nnothing of lying or cheating or stealing if he had to in order to\r\nget the better of other countries. Fair means or foul means made no\r\ndifference to him. But his own people he treated as if they were his\r\nchildren and did everything he could for them. Like a lioness with her\r\ncubs, he fought for his family, even with the world against him.\r\n\r\nThere was a mill close by Frederick’s palace that belonged to a poor\r\nmiller. As it was not a pretty thing to be so near, the king wanted\r\nto buy it in order to tear it down and get rid of it. But the miller\r\nwould not sell. Although Frederick the Great offered the miller a large\r\nsum of money, he refused. A great many kings would simply have taken\r\nthe mill and perhaps put the miller in jail or put him to death, but\r\nFrederick did neither, for he thought his lowliest subject had his\r\nrights and that if he didn’t want to sell he shouldn’t be made to. So\r\nhe left the miller undisturbed, and the mill stands to-day as it did\r\nthen, close to the palace.\r\n\r\nThough Frederick was a German, strange to say, he hated the German\r\nlanguage. He thought it the language of the uneducated. He himself\r\nspoke French and wrote in French and only spoke German when he had to\r\ntalk to his servants or those who did not understand French.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71\r\n\r\nAmerica Gets Rid of Her King\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you know that we once had a king?\r\n\r\nHis name was George.\r\n\r\nNo, George Washington wasn’t a king.\r\n\r\nThis was another George.\r\n\r\nYou remember the Stuarts in England--James, Charles, and the rest of\r\nthe family who ruled England for a hundred years from 1600 to 1700.\r\nWell about 1700 England ran out of Stuarts--there were no more Stuart\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAs England had to have another king, they asked a distant relative of\r\nthe royal family over from one of the German states to rule England.\r\nYes, from Germany to rule England. His name was George, and the English\r\ncalled him George I. George couldn’t even speak English. He was German\r\nand loved his own country much better than England, but he had agreed\r\nto come and rule over England, and he did so. You can imagine what sort\r\nof a king he was. His son, George II ruled after him, although he,\r\ntoo, was more German than English. But when the grandson, George III,\r\ncame to the throne he was a born and bred Englishman. It was in this\r\ngrandson’s reign, in the reign of George III, that our own country, the\r\nUnited States, was born.\r\n\r\nWhen a wheel turns over we call it a _revolution_, which is a big name\r\nfor a little thing.\r\n\r\nWhen a _country_ turns over we also call it a revolution, which is a\r\nbig name for a big thing.\r\n\r\nOur country had started with the two little settlements, or colonies,\r\nas they were called, of Jamestown and Plymouth. But it had grown and\r\ngrown until there were now a number of settlements along the coast\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the people who had settled here were\r\nEnglish, and the king of England ruled over them. The king asked all\r\nthese people to send him money, which was called taxes. Now, the money\r\ncollected from taxes was not, of course, for the king to put in his\r\npocketbook to use as he liked. It was supposed to be spent on the\r\npeople who were taxed, to be used for roads, schools, police, and such\r\nthings that are for the good of all.\r\n\r\nSo these people along the coast who were paying money or taxes to the\r\nking far off across the water thought they ought to have a vote to say\r\nhow this money should be spent and on what it should be spent. But they\r\ndid not have a vote, and so they thought they ought not to have to pay\r\ntaxes to the king away off in England.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading citizens of America at this time was a man named\r\nBenjamin Franklin. He was the son of a candlemaker, but from a poor boy\r\nwho had once walked the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of bread\r\nunder each arm he had risen to a very honored position in the country.\r\nHe had learned to be a printer and had started one of the first and\r\nbest newspapers in the United States. He was a great thinker and had\r\ninvented a stove and a lamp and had succeeded in getting electricity\r\nfrom the lightning in the clouds by flying a kite with a wire during a\r\nstorm. He was one of the Wise Men of the West.\r\n\r\nFranklin was sent over to England to try to get the king to change his\r\nmind about taxing the colonies or to bring about some sort of agreement\r\nwith him. But King George was hardheaded, and Franklin was unable to\r\nstop the king from doing what he had made up his mind to do.\r\n\r\nSo the people in America, finding that talking did no good, started in\r\nto fight. They raised an army. Then they tried to find a good man to\r\ncommand the army. Such a leader must be honest and brave; he must have\r\na good mind; he must love his country; and he must be a good fighter.\r\nSo they looked around for a man who had all these qualities, and they\r\nfound one. The man they picked was honest and brave, for when he was a\r\nboy, he had cut down a favorite tree of his father’s just to try a new\r\nhatchet he had been given. In those days to cut down a cherry-tree was\r\na crime for which by law a man could be put to death. When this boy was\r\nasked by his angry father if he had done it he said, “I cannot tell a\r\nlie; I did.” Of course, now you know who it was--George Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George Washington surveying Lord Fairfax’s farm.]\r\n\r\nGeorge learned to be a surveyor--that is, a man who measures land--and\r\nwhen only sixteen years old he was employed to survey the large farm\r\nof Lord Fairfax in Virginia; that showed he had a good mind. He then\r\nhad been a soldier and had fought the Indians bravely and well; that\r\nshowed that he loved his country and was a good fighter. So George\r\nWashington was chosen to lead the American army against the English.\r\n\r\nThe Americans did not at first think of starting a new country. They\r\nsimply wanted the same rights that Englishmen in England had. But\r\nthey soon found out that there was only one way to get those rights,\r\nand that was to start a new country independent of England. So a man\r\nnamed Thomas Jefferson wrote a paper which was called a Declaration of\r\nIndependence--can you say it?--because it declared that the colonies\r\nwere going to be independent of England. There were fifty-six Americans\r\nchosen by the people to sign it. Each one of the signers would have\r\nbeen put to death as a traitor to England if the United States had not\r\nwon, and each signer knew it, yet he signed it nevertheless. But just\r\nsigning this paper didn’t make England give up the colonies. Oh, no!\r\nKing George’s armies tried to stop the colonies from getting away from\r\nthe rule of England.\r\n\r\nWashington had a very small army with which to fight the English army,\r\nand very little money with which to pay the soldiers or to supply them\r\nwith food or clothes or powder and shot. One winter the soldiers nearly\r\nfroze and starved to death, for they had little clothing and hardly any\r\nfood but carrots, and it seemed as if the war could not go on unless\r\nthey got help. Yet Washington kept up their spirits.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin was sent across the ocean, not to England this time\r\nof course, but to France to see if he couldn’t get some help from that\r\ncountry. France hated England because she had lost part of America,\r\nCanada, in the Seven Years’ War, but at first France would not help.\r\nShe took little interest in the fight for Washington’s army had lost a\r\nnumber of battles against the English, and people don’t like to back a\r\nloser. But the year after the Declaration of Independence the American\r\narmy beat the English badly at a place called Saratoga in New York\r\nState. Then the king of France became more interested, and then he sent\r\nhelp to the colonies to carry on the war. A young French nobleman named\r\nLafayette hurried over from France and fought under General Washington\r\nand did so well that he has made a great name for himself.\r\n\r\nEngland, seeing that things were going against her, now wanted to make\r\npeace with the Americans and give them the same rights that English\r\ncitizens had, but it was then too late. At the beginning of the war the\r\nAmericans would have agreed to this and been glad to agree, but now\r\nthey would agree to nothing less than entire independence of England;\r\nand so the War went on, for England would not let the colonies go.\r\n\r\nThe English had been beaten by the Yankees, as they called them in the\r\nNorth, at a place called Saratoga. So then they sent their general,\r\nLord Cornwallis, to the south of our country to see if he could beat\r\nthe people there. General Greene was put in command of the Southern\r\nAmerican soldiers. Lord Cornwallis tried to fight Greene, but Greene\r\nled Cornwallis a merry chase round the country until he was all tired\r\nout and finally went into a little place called Yorktown in Virginia.\r\nHere Cornwallis and his army were caught fast so that they could not\r\nget out. On one side was the American army, and on the water side were\r\nthe French war-ships that had been sent over to help. So Cornwallis had\r\nto surrender.\r\n\r\nKing George then said, “Let us have peace”; and in 1783 the war was\r\nended by a treaty of peace, eight years after it had started, and the\r\ncolonies were independent of England. This was called the Revolutionary\r\nWar, and after it was over our country was called the United States.\r\n\r\nThere were just thirteen of these original colonies that joined as\r\npartners in this Union. That is why there are just thirteen stripes in\r\nour flag. Some people think thirteen is an unlucky number; but our flag\r\nwith its thirteen stripes still waves over the land, and it has brought\r\nus good luck; don’t you think so?\r\n\r\nWashington was made the first President, and so he is called the Father\r\nof His Country; the First in War, the First in Peace, and the First in\r\nthe Hearts of his Countrymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72\r\n\r\nUpside Down (header upside down)\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles and Mumps are very catching.\r\n\r\nSo are Revolutions.\r\n\r\nJust a little later than the Revolution of the thirteen colonies, the\r\npeople in France had a Revolution, too. They saw how successful the\r\nAmericans had been in their fight against the king of England, and so\r\nthey rebelled against their own king and queen in France. This was\r\ncalled the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe reason the French people rebelled against their king was because\r\nthey had very little, and the king and his royal family and nobles\r\nseemed to have everything. Both the Americans and the French rebelled\r\nagainst paying taxes. With the Americans, however, it was a matter of\r\nprinciple more than anything else. Their taxes were not very large,\r\nbut they thought them unjust. The French taxes, however, not only were\r\nunjust but they took almost everything away from the people.\r\n\r\nI have already told you how bad things were under Louis XIV, and they\r\ngot worse until the people could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nAt this time the king of France was Louis XVI, and his queen was\r\nnamed Marie Antoinette. Although the people were so poor they had\r\nhardly anything to eat except a very coarse and bad-tasting kind of\r\nbread called black bread; they were compelled to pay the king and the\r\nnobles money so that they could live in fine style and have “parties”;\r\nand they had to do all sorts of work for them for nothing or next to\r\nnothing. If any one complained he was put in a great prison in Paris\r\ncalled the Bastille and left there to die. In spite of the fact that\r\nall the people were so terribly poor, the king and the queen and their\r\nfriends lived in luxury and extravagance with everything in the world\r\nthey wanted, all paid for by the poor people.\r\n\r\nNeither the king nor his wife was really wicked. They were simply young\r\nand thoughtless. They meant well, but like a great many well-meaning\r\npeople they lacked common sense and did not know how others lived. They\r\ndidn’t seem to understand that people _could_ be poor, for they had so\r\nmuch themselves. Marie Antoinette was told that her subjects had no\r\nbread to eat. “Then why don’t they eat cake?” she is said to have asked.\r\n\r\nTo right the wrongs of the people, a body of many of the best men from\r\nall France gathered together and, calling themselves the National\r\nAssembly, tried to work out some plan to do away with all the injustice\r\nthe people had been suffering. They wanted to make every one free and\r\nequal and give everybody a “say” in the government.\r\n\r\nBut the poor had become so furiously mad at the way they had been\r\ntreated by the rich that they would stand things no longer and a wild\r\nand angry mob of them attacked the old prison of the Bastille. They\r\nbattered down the walls and freed the prisoners and killed the guards\r\nof the Bastille simply because they were servants of the king. Then\r\nthey cut off the heads of the guards and stuck them on poles and,\r\ncarrying them aloft, paraded through the streets of Paris. There were\r\nonly about half a dozen prisoners in the old jail, so that freeing them\r\ndidn’t matter much, but this attack was to show that the people would\r\nno longer allow the king to imprison them.\r\n\r\nThe Bastille was stormed on July 14, 1789. This is the beginning of\r\nwhat is called the French Revolution, and this day is celebrated in\r\nFrance in almost the same way that our Fourth of July is, for it is the\r\nFrench Declaration of Independence against kings.\r\n\r\nLafayette, who was now back in France, the same Lafayette who had\r\nhelped the Americans fight their king, sent the key of the Bastille\r\nover to George Washington as a souvenir that his own country had now\r\noverthrown its king and declared its independence.\r\n\r\nThe king and queen were living in the beautiful palace at Versailles,\r\nthe palace that Louis XIV had built. All the king’s nobles, when they\r\nheard what was taking place in Paris, became frightened and, deserting\r\ntheir king and queen, took to their heels and left the country. They\r\nknew pretty well what was going to happen, and they didn’t wait to see.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the National Assembly drew up what was called a Declaration\r\nof the Rights of Man, which was something like our Declaration of\r\nIndependence. It said that all men were born free and equal, that the\r\npeople should make the laws and the laws should be the same for all.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Declaration of Rights had been made, the mad mob from\r\nParis, ragged and wild-looking, carrying sticks and stones, and\r\ncrying, “Bread, bread!” marched out the ten miles to Versailles, where\r\nLouis and Marie Antoinette were still living. Up the beautiful grand\r\nstaircase of the palace they rushed. The few guards remaining round\r\nthe king were unable to hold them back. They captured the king and\r\nqueen and took them prisoners to Paris. There they kept Louis and Marie\r\nAntoinette prisoners for several years. Once the king and queen tried\r\nto escape in disguise but were caught before they could get out of the\r\ncountry and brought back.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the National Assembly drew up a Constitution--a set\r\nof rules by which the country should be justly governed. This the king\r\nagreed to and signed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: French revolution crowd and guillotine.]\r\n\r\nBut that still wasn’t enough. The people wanted no king at all to rule\r\nover them. So about a year later they started a real republic like our\r\nown, and the king was sentenced to death. A Frenchman had invented\r\na kind of machine with a big knife for chopping off heads. This was\r\ncalled the guillotine, and it was used instead of an ax, for it was\r\nquicker and surer. So the king was taken to the guillotine, and his\r\nhead was cut off.\r\n\r\nBut the people did not settle down quiet and contented when they had\r\ngot rid of their king. They were afraid that those who were in favor\r\nof kings might start another kingdom. The people chose red, white, and\r\nblue as their colors and the “Marseillaise” as their national song; and\r\neverywhere they marched they carried the tricolor, as they called the\r\nthree-colored flag, and as they marched they sang the “Marseillaise.”\r\n\r\nThen began what is called the Reign of Terror, and this is a tale of\r\nblood. A man named Robespierre and two of his friends were leaders in\r\nthis Reign of Terror. Any one whom the people suspected of being in\r\nfavor of kings they caught and beheaded. The queen was one of the first\r\nto have her head cut off. If any one even whispered, “there’s a man,\r\nor there’s a woman, or there’s a child who is in favor of kings,” that\r\nman, woman, or child would be rushed to the guillotine. If any one\r\nsimply hated another and wished to get rid of him, all he had to do was\r\nto point him out as in favor of kings, and off he would be taken to the\r\nguillotine. No one was sure of his life for a day. He never knew what\r\nmoment some personal enemy might accuse him. Hundreds, then thousands,\r\nof suspected people were beheaded, and a special sewer had to be built\r\nto carry off the blood. But the guillotine, fast as it was, was too\r\nslow for the Terrorists. It could cut off but one head at a time, and\r\nso prisoners were lined up and shot down with cannons.\r\n\r\nPeople seemed to have gone wild, crazy, mad! They insulted Christ and\r\nthe Christian religion. They put a pretty woman called the Goddess of\r\nReason on the altar of the beautiful Church of Notre Dame and worshiped\r\nher instead of the Lord. They pulled down statues and pictures of\r\nChrist and the Virgin Mary. In their places they put statues and\r\npictures of their own leaders. The guillotine was put up in place of\r\nthe cross. They did away with Sundays. They made a week ten days long,\r\nand every tenth day they made a holiday instead of Sunday. They stopped\r\ncounting time from Christ’s birth, because they didn’t want anything\r\nthat had to do with Christ, and they began to call the year when the\r\nrepublic was started in 1792 the year 1.\r\n\r\nBut Robespierre wished to rule alone, and he plotted against his two\r\nfriends. One of these he had beheaded, and the other was killed in his\r\nbath-tub by a girl named Charlotte Corday, who was in a rage at what he\r\nhad done. So Robespierre was left alone. At last the people, in fear of\r\nthis man who was such a monstrous and inhuman tyrant, rose up against\r\nhim. When he found that he too, was to be put to death, he tried to\r\ncommit suicide, but, before he could do so he was caught and taken to\r\nthe guillotine, where he went to the same death to which he had sent\r\ncountless others, and the Reign of Terror was ended. It was a pity that\r\nhe hadn’t a thousand lives with which to pay for the thousands of lives\r\nhe had taken away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\nA Little Giant\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the Revolution was stopped.\r\n\r\nIt was stopped by a young soldier only about twenty years old and sixty\r\ninches tall.\r\n\r\nThe Government was holding a meeting in the palace while a mad mob in\r\nthe streets outside were trying to attack the palace. A young soldier\r\nhad been given a few men and told to keep the mob away. The young\r\nsoldier pointed cannons down each street that led to the palace, and\r\nno one dared to show himself. This young soldier was named Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. He made such a fine record that people wanted to know who he\r\nwas and where he came from.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had been born on a little island called Corsica in the\r\nMediterranean Sea. He was born just in time to be a Frenchman, for the\r\nisland of Corsica had belonged to Italy and had only just been given to\r\nFrance a few weeks before he was born. As soon as he was old enough,\r\nhe was sent off to a military school in France. There his French\r\nschoolmates looked upon him as a foreigner and didn’t have much to\r\ndo with him. But Napoleon made high marks in arithmetic, and he loved\r\nhard problems. Once he shut himself up in his room to work over a hard\r\nproblem, and there he stayed for three days and nights until he had\r\nfound the answer.\r\n\r\nNapoleon showed by the way he put an end to the French Revolution that\r\nhe was going to be a fine soldier, and so when he was only twenty-six\r\nyears old he was made a general.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time all the other countries of Europe had kings. France\r\nhad caught the fever of revolution from the Americans all the way\r\nacross the ocean and had got rid of her kings. The kings of these other\r\ncountries were afraid their people might catch the fever of revolution,\r\ntoo. So all of these other countries became enemies of France because\r\nFrance had put an end to her kings.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was sent off to fight Italy. He had to cross the Alps, which\r\nHannibal in the Punic Wars had crossed long before. But Hannibal had no\r\nheavy cannons when he crossed; it seemed impossible for Napoleon’s army\r\nto cross with cannons. Napoleon asked his engineers, the men who were\r\nsupposed to know about such things, if it could be done. They said they\r\nthought it was impossible.\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” Napoleon angrily replied, “is a word found only in the\r\ndictionary of fools.” Then he shouted:\r\n\r\n“There shall be no Alps!” and went ahead and crossed them. His army won\r\nin Italy, and when he returned to France he was greeted by the people\r\nas a conquering hero. But the men who were then governing France were\r\nafraid of him. They feared he might try to make himself king because\r\nhe was so popular with the people. Napoleon, however, asked to be sent\r\nto conquer Egypt because he had an idea he could get the better of the\r\nEnglish there. He thought he might then cut England off from India, the\r\nnew country that they had won in the reign of James I. England had lost\r\nAmerica, but she didn’t want to lose India.\r\n\r\nThe French Government was very glad to get rid of Napoleon, and so they\r\nsent him off to Egypt as he asked. He quickly conquered Egypt as Julius\r\nCæsar had done, but there was no Cleopatra to upset his plans. While\r\nhe was conquering Egypt, his fleet, which was waiting for him at the\r\nmouth of the Nile, was caught and destroyed by the English fleet under\r\na great admiral, if not the greatest that ever lived. His name was Lord\r\nNelson.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had no way to take his army back to France. So he left his\r\narmy in Egypt under command of another. He himself, however, managed\r\nto find a ship to take him back home. When he reached France he found\r\nthat the men who were supposed to be governing were quarreling among\r\nthemselves, and, seeing his chance, he had himself made one of three\r\nmen chosen to rule France. He was called first consul; and there were\r\nsupposed to be two assistant consuls, but the assistants were little\r\nmore than clerks to do Napoleon’s bidding. It was only a very short\r\ntime before he was next made first consul for life. Then, not long\r\nafter that, he became emperor of France and also king of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe other countries of Europe began to fear that Napoleon would conquer\r\nthem, too, and make them also a part of France. So all the other\r\ncountries joined together to beat him. Napoleon planned to conquer\r\nEngland first, and he got ready a fleet to cross over to England. But\r\nhis fleet was caught off Spain near a point called Trafalgar by the\r\nsame English admiral, Lord Nelson, who had beaten him in Egypt. Before\r\nthis battle, Nelson said to his sailors, “England expects that every\r\nman will do his duty,” and they did it. Napoleon’s fleet was utterly\r\ndestroyed, though Nelson himself was killed.\r\n\r\nNapoleon then gave up the idea of conquering England, and he turned his\r\nattention in the opposite direction. He had beaten Spain and Prussia\r\nand Austria. Almost all Europe either belonged to him or had to do\r\nwhat he said. Then he attacked Russia. It was a great mistake he made,\r\nfor Russia was far off, and it was wintertime and very cold. Still, he\r\nmanaged to reach Moscow way off in the center of Russia with his army.\r\nBut the Russians burned the city and destroyed all the food, so that\r\nNapoleon had nothing with which to feed his army. It was terribly cold;\r\nthere were deep snows; and, in retreating, his army suffered enormous\r\nlosses. Napoleon himself soon made a bee-line to Paris leaving his army\r\nto get back the best way they could. Men and horses died of cold and\r\nhunger by the thousands. Napoleon reached Paris, but his fortune had\r\nturned. All of Europe was getting ready to put an end to the tyrant,\r\nand it was not long after this that he was hemmed in and beaten by his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon saw that he was beaten, he signed a paper saying that he\r\nwould give up and leave France. And so he did, sailing away to a little\r\nisland called Elba, just off the coast of Italy, not far from the\r\nisland where he was born.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Napoleon at St. Helena.]\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon on the island of Elba got an idea that all was not lost\r\nand that he might return to France and get back his power again. So all\r\nof a sudden, to the surprise of France and the rest of the world, he\r\nlanded on the coast of France. The French Government at Paris sent an\r\narmy of his old soldiers against him with orders to meet him and bring\r\nhim to Paris in an iron cage. But when his old soldiers met their old\r\ngeneral they went over to his side, and so with them he marched on to\r\nParis. The English and German armies were north of France and preparing\r\nto fight. Napoleon quickly got together an army and went forth to meet\r\nthem. At a little town called Waterloo, Napoleon fought his last\r\nbattle, for there he was utterly beaten by an English general named\r\nWellington. This was the Year 1815. We still speak and probably always\r\nwill speak of any great defeat as “Waterloo.”\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar sentence which reads backward the same as forward.\r\nIt is what Napoleon might have said after all was over. It is:\r\n\r\n ABLE WAS I ERE I SAW ELBA\r\n\r\nAfter Napoleon was beaten at Waterloo, the English took him away and\r\nput him on a little island far off in the ocean where he could not\r\npossibly escape. It was a lonely spot named St. Helena after the mother\r\nof Constantine. Here he lived for six years before he died.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was probably the greatest general that ever lived, but that\r\ndoes not mean that he was the greatest man. Some say he was the worst,\r\nfor just to make himself great, he killed hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople and brought destruction and ruin to the whole of Europe wherever\r\nhe fought his battles.\r\n\r\nThis brings us up into the nineteenth century, for Napoleon died in\r\n1821. How long ago is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74\r\n\r\nFrom Pan and His Pipes to the Phonograph\r\n\r\n\r\n              Frogs croak;\r\n              Cats me-ow;\r\n              Dogs bark;\r\n              Sheep bleat;\r\n              Cows moo;\r\n              Lions roar;\r\n              Hyenas laugh;\r\n  But only birds and people _sing_.\r\n  All other animals simply make noises.\r\n  But people can do what birds cannot.\r\n  They can also make music out of _things_.\r\n\r\nHave you ever made a cigar-box fiddle or a pin piano or musical glasses?\r\n\r\nIn the long-ago story-book times Apollo took a pair of cow-horns and\r\nfastened between them seven strings made from the cow’s skin. This\r\nwas called a lyre. These strings he picked with his fingers or with\r\na quill, making a little tinkling sound that could hardly have been\r\nvery beautiful. Yet Apollo’s son Orpheus is said to have learned from\r\nhis father to play so beautifully on the lyre that the birds and wild\r\nbeasts and even trees and rocks gathered round to hear him.\r\n\r\nPan, the god of the woods, who had goat’s horns and ears and legs and\r\nfeet, tied together several whistles of different lengths and played on\r\nthese as you might on a mouth-organ. This instrument was called Pan’s\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nThe lyre and Pan’s pipes were the two earliest musical instruments.\r\nThe first was a stringed instrument; the second a wind instrument. The\r\nlong strings and long pipes made low notes; the short strings and short\r\npipes made high tones.\r\n\r\nFrom Apollo’s lyre we get the piano with its many, many strings. Did\r\nyou ever look at the inside of a piano and see the many strings of\r\ndifferent lengths? They are, however, not picked as the strings of a\r\nlyre or harp are picked, but hammered by little felt-covered blocks as\r\nyou touch the keys.\r\n\r\nFrom Pan’s pipes we get the great church organ with its pipes like\r\ngiant whistles. You don’t, of course, blow the pipes with your mouth\r\nas you do a whistle. The pipes are so big you must blow them with a\r\nmachine like a tire-pump, and you do this as you touch the keys.\r\n\r\nWe know what the instruments in olden times were like, but we don’t\r\nknow what the music that people made was really like; there were no\r\nphonographs to bottle up the sounds and, when uncorked a thousand\r\nyears later, to pour forth the old notes once again. The music went off\r\ninto thin air and was lost.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the Year 1000 A.D. that music could even be\r\nwritten down. Before then all music was played “by ear,” for there was\r\nno written music. A Benedictine monk named Guy, or, in Italian, Guido,\r\nthought of a way to write down musical notes, and he named the notes\r\ndo, re, mi, fa, and so on. These were the first letters of the words of\r\na hymn to St. John which the monks sang like the scale.\r\n\r\nAnother Italian is sometimes called the “father of modern music.” His\r\nname is Palestrina, and he died about 1600. He set the church service\r\nto music, and the pope ordered all churches to follow it, but the\r\npeople didn’t like his music very much; that is, it was not what we\r\ncall “popular.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until a hundred years later--that is, about 1700--that the\r\nfirst great musician lived who wrote music that was really popular,\r\nthat the people loved, and that we still love to-day.\r\n\r\nHe was a German named Handel. His father was a barber, a dentist, and\r\ndoctor, and he wanted his boy to become a great lawyer. But the only\r\nthing the boy liked was music.\r\n\r\nIn those days there were no pianos. There was a little instrument\r\nwith strings which was played by touching keys. This was called a\r\nclavichord. Sometimes it had legs like a table. Sometimes it had no\r\nlegs and was just laid on a table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handel is found in the attic.]\r\n\r\nHandel, though only six years old, got hold of one of these\r\ninstruments, and, without any one finding out about it, he had it put\r\nup in his room in the attic of his house. After every one had gone to\r\nbed at night he would practise on this clavichord until late, when he\r\nwas supposed to be in bed. One night his family heard sounds up under\r\nthe roof. Wondering what it could be, they took a lantern, and, quietly\r\nclimbing the attic stairs, they suddenly opened the door, and there sat\r\nlittle Handel in his night-clothes on a chair with his feet reaching\r\nonly half-way to the floor, playing on the clavichord.\r\n\r\nAfter that Handel’s father saw it was no use trying to make his son\r\na lawyer. So he got teachers for him, and before long the boy amazed\r\nthe world with his playing. He went to England, lived there, became\r\nan Englishman, and when he died the English people buried him in\r\nWestminster Abbey, a church in which famous Englishmen were buried.\r\n\r\nHandel “set the Bible to music.” These songs with the Bible words\r\nto be sung by a chorus of voices were called _oratorios_, and one\r\nof these oratorios named “The Messiah” is sung almost everywhere at\r\nChristmas-time.\r\n\r\nLiving at the same time with Handel was another German musician named\r\nBach. Bach played divinely on the organ as Handel did on the clavichord\r\nand wrote some of the finest music for the organ that ever has been\r\nwritten. Strange that both Handel and Bach went blind in their old age,\r\nbut to them it was sound, not sight, that counted most. Here is another\r\ngood subject for an argument: would you rather be deaf or blind?\r\n\r\nAlmost all musical geniuses have been musical wonders when they were\r\nstill babies. They have been great musicians even before learning to\r\nread and write.\r\n\r\nOne such genius was born just before Handel died. He was an Austrian\r\nnamed Mozart.\r\n\r\nMozart when only four years old played the piano wonderfully. He also\r\nwrote music--composing, it is called--for others to play.\r\n\r\nMozart’s father and sister played very well, so the three went on a\r\nconcert tour. Mozart, the boy wonder, played before the empress, and\r\neverywhere he went he was treated like a prince, petted and praised and\r\ngiven parties and presents.\r\n\r\nThen he grew up and married, and ever after he had the hardest kind of\r\na time trying to make a living. He composed all sorts of things, plays\r\nwith music called operas, and symphonies, which are written for whole\r\norchestras to play; but he made so little money that when he died he\r\nhad to be buried where they put people who were too poor to have a\r\ngrave for themselves alone. People afterward thought it a shame that\r\nsuch a great composer should have no monument over his grave, but then\r\nit was too late to find where he was buried. A monument was put up, but\r\nto this day no one knows where Mozart’s body lies.\r\n\r\nA German named Beethoven had read the stories of the boy wonder,\r\nMozart, and he thought he, too, would like to have a boy wonder to play\r\nbefore kings and queens. So when his son Louis was only five years old\r\nhe kept the boy practising long hours at the piano until he became\r\nso tired that the tears ran down his cheeks. But Louis Beethoven, or\r\nLudwig, as he was called in German, finally came to be one of the\r\ngreatest musicians that have ever lived. He could sit at the piano and\r\nmake up the most beautiful music as he went along--improvise, as it is\r\ncalled--but he was never satisfied with it when written down. Time and\r\ntime again he would scratch out and rewrite his music until it had been\r\nrewritten often a dozen times.\r\n\r\nBut Beethoven’s hearing began to grow dull. He was worried that he\r\nmight lose it entirely--a terrible thing to happen to any one, but\r\nto one whose hearing was his fortune nothing could be worse. And at\r\nlast he did become deaf. This loss of his hearing made Beethoven\r\nhopelessly sad and bad-tempered, cross with everything and everybody.\r\nNevertheless, he didn’t give up; he kept on composing just the same,\r\neven after he could no longer hear what he had written.\r\n\r\nAnother great and unusual German musician named Wagner lived until\r\n1883. Though he practised all his life, he never could play very well.\r\nBut he composed the most wonderful operas that have ever been written,\r\nand he wrote not only the music but the words, too. He took old myths\r\nand fairy-tales and made them into plays to be sung to music. At first\r\nsome people made fun of his music, for it seemed to them so noisy and\r\n“slam-bangy” and without tune. But people now make fun of those “some\r\npeople” who don’t like it!\r\n\r\nI have told you in other places of painters and poets, of architects\r\nand wise men, of kings and heroes, of wars and troubles. I have put\r\nthis story of music of all ages in one chapter which I have tucked in\r\nhere between the acts, to give you a rest for a moment from wars and\r\nrumors of wars.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I never heard any great musicians play. Now you and I\r\ncan turn on the phonograph any time and hear the music of Palestrina or\r\nMozart, of Beethoven or Wagner, of dozens of other masters, played or\r\nsung to us whenever we wish; the greatest musicians become our slaves.\r\nNo caliph in the “Arabian Nights” could command such service to his\r\npleasure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\nThe Daily Papers of 1854-1865\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you could go up into your grandfather’s attic or the attic of\r\nsomebody else’s grandfather, or would dig down into some old trunk, you\r\nmight find some of the newspapers that were printed during the years\r\nfrom 1854 to 1865. Then you might actually read in these daily papers\r\nthe happenings that I am now going to tell you about. Many people still\r\nalive have taken part in some of these events themselves or know those\r\nwho have. Under the heading, “Foreign News,” you would probably find\r\nsome of the following things told about:\r\n\r\nENGLISH NEWS. At this time the queen of England was named Victoria. She\r\nwas much beloved by her people because she had such a kindly nature and\r\nChristian spirit. She was more like a mother to her people than like a\r\nqueen. She ruled for more than half a century, and the time when she\r\nruled is called the Victorian Age.\r\n\r\nThe English news of 1854 would tell about a war that the English were\r\nthen fighting with Russia. Russia was a long way off, and so the\r\nEnglish had to send their soldiers in boats through the Mediterranean\r\nSea to the end, then past Constantinople in to the Black Sea. There in\r\na little spot of land that jutted out from Russia into the Black Sea\r\nmost of the fighting was done. This little spot of land was called the\r\nCrimea, and the war therefore was called the Crimean War. In this war\r\nin that far-off land thousands of English soldiers died from wounds and\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nNow, there was living in England at the time of this war a lady named\r\nFlorence Nightingale. She was very tender-hearted and always looking\r\nout for and taking care of those that were sick. Even as a little girl\r\nshe had played that her dolls were sick with headache or a broken leg,\r\nand she would bandage the aching head or broken leg and pretend to\r\ntake care of her sick patient. When her dog was ill she nursed him as\r\ncarefully as if he were a human being.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale heard that English soldiers were dying by the\r\nthousands in that distant land far away from home and that there were\r\nno nurses to take care of the wounded. So she got together a number of\r\nladies, and they went out to the Crimea. Before she arrived almost half\r\nthe soldiers who were wounded died--fifty soldiers out of a hundred;\r\nafter she and her nurses came, only two in a hundred died. She went\r\nabout through the camps and over the battlefields at night carrying a\r\nlamp looking for the wounded. The soldiers called her the Lady of the\r\nLamp, and they all loved her.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the war was over and she returned to England, the\r\nGovernment voted to give her a large sum of money for what she had\r\ndone. She, however, refused the money for herself but took it to found\r\na home for training nurses. Nowadays trained nurses are thought almost\r\nas necessary as doctors, and any one who is sick can call in a trained\r\nnurse to take care of him, but at that time there were no trained\r\nnurses and no one had ever heard of such a thing. Florence Nightingale\r\nwas the first to start trained nursing, and so she is looked upon\r\nalmost as a saint by trained nurses.\r\n\r\nIn one battle in the Crimea a company of soldiers mounted on horseback\r\nwere given by mistake an order to attack the enemy. Though they knew it\r\nmeant certain death, they never hesitated but charged, and two-thirds\r\nof them were killed or wounded in less than half an hour. Lord\r\nTennyson, the English poet, has told this story in verse which you may\r\nknow. It is called “The Charge of the Light Brigade.”\r\n\r\nJAPANESE NEWS. Japan is a group of islands near China. Although I have\r\nnot told you about it before, it was an old country, settled in its\r\nways even before Rome was founded. In Europe there have been constant\r\nchanges of kings and rulers and people and countries. But in Japan they\r\nhave had the same line of kings since before Christ.\r\n\r\nJapan wanted no white people in her country, and, with a very few\r\nexceptions, she had always kept them out. But in 1854, the same year\r\nthat England began the Crimean War, an American naval officer named\r\nCommodore Perry went to Japan and made an agreement, or treaty, as\r\nit is called, by which Japan allowed white people to come in and do\r\nbusiness with her people. The Japanese seemed hungry for knowledge, to\r\nlearn how to do things in the white man’s way. When Perry first went to\r\nJapan the Japanese lived the same way they had a thousand years before.\r\nThey knew nothing of the white man’s inventions or ways of living. But\r\nin fifty years’ time they have jumped a thousand years in civilization!\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things you might read about in those old\r\nnewspapers. Such news would probably have taken up little space;\r\nperhaps they would have been found down at the bottom of a column if\r\nthe newspaper were American. But if the paper was printed between 1861\r\nand 1864, the greater part of it would be about a war that was going on\r\nin our own country at that time. This was a war between our own people,\r\na family quarrel, which we call the Civil War.\r\n\r\nTwo parts of our country, the North and the South, did not agree on\r\nseveral matters, chief of which was the question whether the South\r\ncould own slaves. So they went to war with each other. Each side fought\r\nfor what it believed was right, and thousands upon thousands gave their\r\nlives for what they believed. The war lasted for four years, from 1861\r\nto 1865, before it was decided that no one could ever again own slaves\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nSome of you who read these pages had grandfathers or great-grandfathers\r\nwho fought in this war. Some of these fought for the South; some fought\r\nfor the North. Some of them may have died for the South; some of them\r\nmay have died for the North.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States at this time was a man named Abraham\r\nLincoln. Lincoln was a very poor boy who had been born in a log cabin.\r\nHe had taught himself to read by the light of a blazing knot of wood\r\nat night after his day’s work was done. As he was very poor, he had\r\nonly a few books, and these he read over and over again. One of these\r\nbooks was the same “Æsop’s Fables” that you read. When Lincoln was a\r\nyoung man, he became a storekeeper. One day he found that he had given\r\na poor woman a smaller package of tea than she had paid for, and so he\r\nclosed the store and walked many miles to her house in order to return\r\nthe change. People began to call him Honest Abe after that, for he was\r\nalways very honest and kind-hearted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lincoln visiting camp and shaking hands with the\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\nHe studied hard and became a lawyer and at last was elected President\r\nof the United States. One day while he was in a theater watching a play\r\nhe was shot and killed by one of the actors who thought Lincoln had not\r\ndone right in freeing the slaves.\r\n\r\nLincoln was one of our greatest Presidents. Washington started our\r\ncountry; Lincoln prevented its splitting into two parts, and kept it\r\ntogether as one big united land to grow into the great country it now\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\nThree New Postage-Stamps\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are getting pretty close to the present time, to “Now.”\r\n\r\nLet us look backward a minute to see what had been going on in Europe\r\nsince the time of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAfter Napoleon had been sent to Elba, the French had to have another\r\nruler. They wanted their old kings back again. The family name of\r\ntheir old kings was Bourbon. So the French thought they ought to have\r\na Bourbon ruler over them. Accordingly they tried out three Bourbons\r\none after the other, all relatives of their last king, whom they had\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nBut all of them proved no good, the French people had given the Bourbon\r\nfamily a good tryout, and so at last they stopped worrying with kings\r\nand started another republic.\r\n\r\nNow, a republic has a president instead of a king, so that the people\r\nhad to choose a president; and whom do you suppose they picked\r\nout? Why, the nephew of Napoleon. The nephew of Napoleon was named\r\nLouis Napoleon. He had planned and plotted again and again to make\r\nhimself king of France, but again and again he had failed. And now he\r\nwas elected president! But Louis Napoleon didn’t want to be _only_\r\npresident. He wanted to be like his uncle the great Napoleon. He\r\ndreamed of being emperor and conquering Europe, and so it was not long\r\nafter this before he had himself made emperor, and he called himself\r\nNapoleon III.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Napoleon I had a young son who might have been Napoleon II if\r\nhe had lived. The story is, that when Napoleon III was made emperor\r\nhis name was printed simply with three exclamation marks after\r\nit--“Napoleon!!!” and this was by mistake read Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III was jealous of the neighboring country of Prussia. She was\r\ngetting to be too strong, he thought. Prussia had a king at this time\r\nnamed William who was very able himself, and he had an able assistant\r\nor prime minister named Bismarck, who was looking for an excuse to\r\nfight France. So presently a war was started between the two countries\r\nin 1870. Napoleon soon found he had made a bad mistake in picking the\r\nwar with Prussia. Prussia was not _getting_ too strong; she was already\r\ntoo strong.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III was completely beaten by Prussia, and he with a large army\r\nhad to surrender. Then in disgrace he went to live in England.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians marched into Paris and made the French agree to pay them\r\na billion dollars. When some of the French towns said they couldn’t\r\npay, Bismarck lined up the leading citizens of the place and told them\r\nthey would be shot if they didn’t raise the money that was demanded.\r\nSo France paid, and to the wonder and amazement of everybody she paid\r\nthis immense sum in two years’ time. But the French and the French\r\nchildren have never forgotten the way they were made to pay and the way\r\nthey were treated by the Prussians, and so ever since then there has\r\nbeen deadly enmity between these two countries. This war was called the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, as it was between France and Prussia.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of little countries near Prussia. They were called\r\nGerman states. But though their people were related, the countries or\r\nstates were separate. As a result of this war, Prussia was able to join\r\nall these German states together and to make for the first time one\r\nbig, strong, powerful nation called Germany, feared by other countries\r\non account of her great army of fighting men. William was made emperor\r\nof all Germany and called kaiser. He was crowned in the French palace\r\nat Versailles that Louis XIV had built.\r\n\r\nThe French thought the Germans had been able to win this war because\r\nthey had public schools in which all their children were trained, and\r\nbecause of the way their soldiers were drilled. So France set to work\r\nand started public schools everywhere in France and imitated the German\r\nway of drilling their army so that they would be ready for them in the\r\nnext war.\r\n\r\nEver since then France has been a republic with a president and an\r\nAssembly chosen by the people.\r\n\r\nAt that time Italy was not a single country as now but like Germany a\r\ncollection of small states. Some of these were independent, some were\r\nowned by France, some were owned by Austria. The king of one of these\r\nItalian states was Victor Emmanuel. He wanted all the Italian states\r\nto unite and become one single country like our United States. He was\r\nhelped by his prime minister, a very able man named Cavour, and by a\r\nrough but romantic popular hero named Garibaldi, who was called the\r\nhero of the Red Shirt.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi, who had been a candle-maker in New York City, was always\r\npoor and seemed not to care for money. He was so popular that whenever\r\nhe called for soldiers to fight with him for his beloved Italy, they at\r\nonce flocked around him ready to fight to the death.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last these three, Victor Emmanuel, Cavour, and Garibaldi,\r\nsucceeded in making their country one big nation. The Italians erected\r\nmonuments to them and named streets after them. To Victor Emmanuel they\r\nbuilt a magnificent building on a hill in Rome overlooking the city, a\r\nbuilding that was intended to be more beautiful than anything built in\r\nAthens during the time of Pericles or in Italy during the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIf you collect postage-stamps it would be interesting for you to get,\r\nif you can, stamps of these countries at that time, the New French\r\nRepublic, United Germany, and United Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1870]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\nThe Age of Miracles\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may think the Age of Miracles was when Christ lived.\r\n\r\nBut if a man who lived at that time should come back to earth now he\r\nwould think _this_ the Age of Miracles.\r\n\r\nIf he heard you talk over a wire to a person a thousand miles away, he\r\nwould think you a magician.\r\n\r\nIf you showed him people moving and acting on a movie screen, he would\r\nthink you a witch.\r\n\r\nIf he heard you start a band playing by turning on a phonograph, he\r\nwould think you a devil.\r\n\r\nIf he saw you fly through the air in an airplane, he would think you a\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nWe are so used to the telephone, telegraph, and phonograph; to\r\nsteamboats, steam railroads, and trolley-cars; to electric lights,\r\nmotor-cars, moving pictures, radio, and airplanes, that it is hard to\r\nimagine a world in which there were none of these things--absolutely\r\nnone of these things. Yet in the Year 1800 not a single one of these\r\ninventions was known.\r\n\r\nNeither George Washington nor Napoleon ever saw a steam-engine, a\r\nsteam-car, nor a steamboat. They had never used a telephone nor a\r\ntelegraph nor a bicycle. My own grandfather never saw a trolley-car\r\nnor an electric light. Even my father never saw a phonograph, a moving\r\npicture, an automobile, nor a flying-machine.\r\n\r\nMore wonders have been made in the last hundred years than in all the\r\nprevious centuries of the world put together.\r\n\r\nA Scotchman named James Watt was one of the first of these magicians\r\nwhom we call inventors. Watt had watched a boiling kettle on the stove\r\nand noticed that the steam lifted the lid. This gave him an idea that\r\nsteam might lift other things as well as the lid of a tea-kettle. So he\r\nmade a machine in which steam lifted a lid called a piston in such a\r\nway as to turn a wheel. This was the first steam-engine.\r\n\r\nWatt’s steam-engine moved wheels and other things, but it didn’t move\r\nitself. An Englishman named Stephenson put Watt’s engine on wheels and\r\nmade the engine move its own wheels. This was the first locomotive.\r\nSoon funny-looking carriages drawn by funny-looking engines were made\r\nto run on tracks in America. At first these trains ran only a few miles\r\nout from such cities as Baltimore and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThen a young fellow named Robert Fulton thought he could make a boat\r\ngo by putting Watt’s engine on board and making it turn paddle-wheels.\r\nPeople laughed at him and called the boat he was building “Fulton’s\r\nFolly,” which means “foolishness.” But the boat worked, and Fulton\r\nhad the laugh on those who had laughed at him. He called his boat the\r\n_Clermont_, and it made regular trips up and down the river.\r\n\r\nNo one had ever before been able to talk to another far off until\r\nthe telegraph was invented. The telegraph makes a clicking sound.\r\nElectricity flows through a wire from one place to another place\r\nwhich may be a long distance off. If you press a button at one end of\r\nthe wire you stop the electricity flowing through the wire, and the\r\ninstrument at the other end makes a click. A short click is called a\r\ndot, and a long click is called a dash. These dots and dashes stand for\r\nletters of the alphabet, so you can spell out a message by dots and\r\ndashes.\r\n\r\n  A is . --        dot-dash\r\n  B is -- ...      dash-dot-dot-dot\r\n  E is .           dot\r\n  H is ....        dot-dot-dot-dot\r\n  T is --          dash\r\n\r\nAn American painter named Morse invented this wonderful little\r\ninstrument. He built the first telegraph line in America between\r\nBaltimore and Washington, and this was the first message he clicked\r\nacross it: “What hath God wrought!”\r\n\r\nA school-teacher named Bell was trying to find some way of making deaf\r\nchildren hear, and in doing so he invented the telephone. The telephone\r\ncarries words as the telegraph carries clicks. You do not have to know\r\na special alphabet or spell out words by dots and dashes as you do on\r\nthe telegraph. With the telephone any one can talk from one side of\r\nAmerica to the other.\r\n\r\nMany inventions now in every-day use have been partly invented by\r\nseveral people, so that it is hard to say just which one thought of\r\nthe invention first. Several people thought of a way to run a machine\r\nby feeding it electricity. This was the electric motor. Then others\r\nthought of a way to run a machine by exploding gas. This was the motor\r\nused in automobiles.\r\n\r\nElectric lights, such as we use indoors, were invented by Thomas Alva\r\nEdison. Edison is called a wizard, because in the Middle Ages wizards\r\nwere supposed to be able to do and to make all sorts of wonderful and\r\nimpossible things, to turn lead into gold, to make people invisible,\r\nand that sort of thing. But Edison has done things that no wizard of a\r\nfairy-tale had ever even thought of. Edison was a poor boy who sold\r\nnewspapers and magazines on a train. He was interested in all sorts of\r\nexperiments and fitted up a place in the baggage-car where he could\r\nmake experiments. But he made so much of a mess in the car that at last\r\nthe baggage-man kicked Edison’s whole outfit off the train. Edison\r\ninvented many things connected with the phonograph and the movies, and\r\nhe has probably made more useful and important inventions than any\r\nother man who has ever lived, so that he is much greater than those\r\nmere kings who have done nothing but quarrel and destroy--without whom\r\nthe world would have been much better off if they had never lived!\r\n\r\nThousands of people who have lived in the past ages have tried to fly\r\nand failed. Millions of people have said it was impossible to fly and\r\nfoolish to try. Some have even said it was wicked to try, that God\r\nmeant that only birds and angels should fly. At last, after long years\r\nof work and thousands of trials, two American brothers named Wright did\r\nthe impossible. They invented the airplane and flew.\r\n\r\nAn Italian named Marconi invented the radio, and others every day are\r\nstill making wonderful inventions, but you will have to read about\r\nthese yourself, for we are near the end of our history.\r\n\r\nHere is a good subject for an argument or debate: Are we any happier\r\n_with_ all these inventions than people were a thousand years ago\r\n_without_ them?\r\n\r\nLife is faster and more exciting; but it is more difficult and more\r\ndangerous. Instead of enjoying a book curled up in the corner of a\r\nsofa by a crackling fire, we leave a steam radiator and go out to\r\nthe movies. Instead of singing or playing the violin, we turn on the\r\ngraphophone or the player-piano and miss the chief joy in music, the\r\njoy of making it ourselves. Instead of the jogging drive in an old\r\nbuggy behind a horse that goes along through the country-side almost by\r\nhimself, we speed on in dangerous autos, to which we must pay constant,\r\nundivided attention or be wrecked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1905]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78\r\n\r\nGERMANY FIGHTS THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was one of the few without a fight in it. But now,\r\nto make up for that, I must tell you about the greatest and the worst\r\nfight in history.\r\n\r\nThere is a little country in Europe called Serbia. It is next door\r\nto Austria. A young man who lived in Serbia shot an Austrian prince.\r\nLittle Serbia apologized to Austria for what one of her people had\r\ndone. But Austria insisted that the Serbian nation was to blame for\r\nwhat had been done; she refused to accept the apology and started in to\r\npunish Serbia.\r\n\r\nI once saw a little dog snap at a big boy. The owner of the little dog\r\napologized to the big boy for what his dog had done. But the big boy\r\ndid not accept the apology, and he started in to thrash the little\r\nboy for what his dog had done. Presently a crowd gathered round, the\r\nfriends of each boy took sides, and there was a general free-for-all\r\n“scrap.”\r\n\r\nSo it was in this case. One of Austria’s big friends, Germany, took\r\nsides against Serbia, and Russia took the side of Serbia. Ever since\r\nthe time of the Franco-Prussian War and Bismarck and William, Germany\r\nhad been in training for a fight, and so had her neighbors. Nearly all\r\nthe countries of Europe had for years been getting together into two\r\ngroups, made up of the friends and the enemies of Germany; and the two\r\nwere ready to jump at each other as soon as Austria, or Germany, or\r\nanybody else, struck at any one.\r\n\r\nBut Germany didn’t strike at Serbia; Austria didn’t really need her\r\nhelp against Serbia. Germany was sure that France, who was her enemy\r\nand Russia’s friend, would take sides against her; and so she rushed\r\nat France to destroy her before Russia could hit hard from the other\r\nside. Now, to get at France Germany had to get through the little\r\ncountry of Belgium. She and France had agreed that neither would march\r\narmies through Belgium, but when the war began her armies marched in\r\nanyway and pushed aside the Belgians, who tried to stop them. And so\r\nher armies rushed on toward the capital of France, Paris. She got as\r\nfar as a little stream called the Marne, only twenty miles from Paris.\r\nBut here the French under General Foch stopped her army. This battle of\r\nthe Marne is probably the most famous of all the battles you have heard\r\nabout in history, for though the war was not ended for four years after\r\nthis battle, if the Germans had won at the Marne, the war would have\r\nbeen over, with Germany victor, and the rest of the world would have\r\nhad to do what Germany said.\r\n\r\nGermany was the first to use poison gas, trying to smother her enemy;\r\nshe fought with submarines from under the sea; she attacked passenger\r\nships that could not fight back. The English navy was the strongest,\r\nand it was only with submarines that Germany could fight at sea. This\r\nwar was the first one in history in which battles were fought not only\r\non land but up in the air and down under the water.\r\n\r\nEngland took sides with France and Russia--and these were called\r\nAllies--to fight against Germany and Austria, and at first the war was\r\nbetween these countries only. Before the war ended, however, almost all\r\nthe countries of the world had taken sides against Germany, for they\r\nknew that if she won she would be able to tell the rest of the world\r\nwhat to do. Then all of a sudden Russia had a revolution. The Russian\r\npeople killed their ruler, the czar, and his family, and refused to\r\nfight any longer. Things began to look pretty bad for the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe United States did not start into the war until 1917, almost three\r\nyears after it had begun; then she did so because German submarines\r\nwere sinking American passenger ships and killing Americans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Surrender of Germans.]\r\n\r\nAmerica was so far off--three thousand miles away--and across an ocean\r\nthat it seemed impossible that she could do much in the war. But in\r\na very short time she had sent two million soldiers across in ships.\r\nUnder General Pershing they fought great battles. At last Germany was\r\nutterly beaten, and on Armistice day, November 11, 1918, Germany\r\nsigned a paper agreeing to do everything the Allies asked; and so the\r\ngreatest war in history ended. The kaiser went to live in Holland, and\r\nGermany became a republic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1918]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79\r\n\r\nYesterday, To-day, and To-morrow\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a candy shop near where I live. On its sign it says, “Made\r\nFresh Every Hour.” History is being made every day. It is being made\r\nfresh almost every hour. The newsboy even now is calling outside of my\r\nwindow, “Extra! Extra!” Is it a new war? Is it a new discovery? If you\r\nhad clipped head-lines from the papers since the World War, here are\r\nsome of the things you might have pasted in your scrapbook.\r\n\r\n  TREATY OF PEACE\r\n  SIGNED AT VERSAILLES\r\n\r\n  Nations Agree on Terms of Peace\r\n\r\n  The Mohammedan Turks in the East Are\r\n  Again Threatening the Christian\r\n  Nations of the West\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE IRISH FREE\r\n  STATE ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\n  After Centuries of Struggle to Become\r\n  Independent of England, Ireland at\r\n  Last, with England’s Permission, Has\r\n  Set Up a Government of Her Own\r\n\r\n\r\n  COLUMBUS OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n  Read, an American, Crosses Atlantic\r\n  Ocean for First Time in an Airplane;\r\n  Lands at the Azores and Then in\r\n  Portugal; Several Others Soon Follow,\r\n  and the Ocean Is Crossed a Number of\r\n  Times\r\n\r\n\r\n  WOMEN CAN VOTE AT LAST\r\n\r\n  All Through the Ages Women Have Had\r\n  Little or No “Say” in the Government;\r\n  Now, for the First Time, They Can\r\n  Vote in Our Country and in Most\r\n  Other Civilized Countries\r\n\r\n\r\n  STRONG DRINK PROHIBITED\r\n\r\n  The Use of Wine and Strong Drink,\r\n  Which Has Caused So Much Crime,\r\n  Disease, Death and Unhappiness, Has\r\n  Been Forbidden in the United States\r\n  and Limited in Many Other Countries;\r\n  in the Generations to Come, Men Will\r\n  Probably Marvel That There Was Once\r\n  a Time When People Drank Poison for\r\n  Pleasure\r\n\r\nFrom now on you will have to read your history in the daily papers.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, history has been marked by the story of one war after\r\nanother, some big, some small, some short, some long. Almost always a\r\nfight has been going on somewhere. It has been War, War, War; Fight,\r\nFight, Fight. Children scratch, kick, and bite. But the older we get,\r\nthe less do we use our fists and feet to settle quarrels. So fighting\r\nseems to be a sign of childhood--that we are “kids”--and our fights,\r\nthat we call wars, a sign of how young the world really is and we\r\nreally are; a sign that the world is still but a minute or two old.\r\n\r\nNow, we admire and praise as heroes Horatius, Leonidas, Joan of Arc,\r\nand General Foch and those others who have defended their countries\r\nagainst the attacks of the enemy, as we would admire a man who shoots a\r\nburglar or a murderer that attacks his family in the night. But those,\r\nwhether kings, generals, or princes, who do the attacking and take life\r\nwith no other excuse than to add to their power or wealth or glory,\r\nare no better than burglars who go forth with a gun and a blackjack to\r\nwaylay, rob, and murder for the same purpose. War kills, war destroys,\r\nwar costs millions of lives and billions of dollars--money that could\r\nbe used to make us happy, instead of causing bitterness, suffering,\r\nmisery, and unhappiness; blind men and cripples, widows and orphans. No\r\none is better off, not even the winner. It is a terrible game, in which\r\neven the winner loses. And yet in the long run who knows? It may be the\r\nonly way the world can grow!\r\n\r\nBut this is certain: if wars do not end, they will be fought with\r\nsomething more deadly, more terrible than shot and shell. Sooner or\r\nlater, some man of science will invent a disease more catching than\r\nthe terrible plague, more deadly than the Black Death with which to\r\nattack the enemy. But if such a disease is let loose, once started it\r\nwill spread from one being to the next till every one has caught it and\r\ndied and no one will escape. Or he will invent a poison to poison the\r\nair we breathe that will spread like the wind or like wildfire in dry\r\ngrass, and there will be no stopping it. The air that wraps the globe\r\nwill be a sea of poison gas. Every thing that breathes will take only\r\none breath, and every man, woman, and child, every beast of the field,\r\nevery bird and flying thing will drop dead. Or he will invent something\r\na million times more powerful than gunpowder or dynamite--something so\r\nexplosive that when discovered by some Mr. Swartz it will blow him, his\r\nhouse, his town, his country, and the whole world to kingdom come--and\r\nthat will be the end of this little spark off the sun.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have looked through a microscope at what seem to be wars\r\nbetween germs. As germs might look up at the eye of the microscope\r\nthrough which we watch their life-and-death struggles, and wonder what\r\nis up above on the other side looking down at them, so we may look\r\nup at the blue eye of heaven above us and wonder what all-seeing,\r\nall-knowing, all-powerful being up there is watching our own\r\nlife-and-death struggles here below.\r\n\r\nOur little world, which seems so immense to us, is really only a tiny\r\nspeck, only one of countless other specks floating in space; it is like\r\none of the tiny motes which you may see any time in a sunbeam that\r\nshines in at the window. Who has an eye so keen that he can count the\r\nmoving motes in such a beam of light? Who would miss one such grain of\r\ndust if it should disappear? So this grain of dust we call the World\r\nand all of us who live upon it could vanish without ever being noticed!\r\n\r\nThis story ends here, but only for the present, for history is a\r\ncontinued story and will never end.\r\n\r\nIf you were living in the Year 10,000 A.D., as some boy will be, your\r\nhistory would only be just begun when you had reached where we are now.\r\nEven the World War would then seem as long ago as the fights of the\r\nStone Age men seem to us. You might think of us and all the inventions\r\nwe consider so wonderful as we think of the discovery of copper and\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\nWill the history that is written in the Year 10,000 have any wars to\r\ntell about? If the wars on Earth cease, will there be wars with other\r\nworlds?\r\n\r\nAnd if there are no more wars, what will history tell about? Will it\r\nbe new inventions? What kinds? Will it be new discoveries? We know\r\nevery corner of the world now. Will it be the inside of this world or\r\nother new worlds or a spiritual world?\r\n\r\nPerhaps then people will no longer use trains, steamboats, automobiles,\r\nor even flying-machines, but go from place to place as on some magic\r\ncarpet, simply by wishing. Perhaps then they will no longer use\r\nletters, telephones, or telegraphs, or even radio, but read each\r\nother’s thoughts at any distance.\r\n\r\nAnd so on--World without end--AMEN!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRONOUNCING INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list of the most important names in the book tells you on what\r\npage you may find each name and how to
