  "content": "A SHORT HISTORY OF\r\n\r\nMONKS\r\n\r\nAND MONASTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_By_ ALFRED WESLEY WISHART\r\n\r\nSometime _Fellow_ in _Church History_ in _The University of Chicago_\r\n\r\nALBERT BRANDT, PUBLISHER\r\nTRENTON, NEW JERSEY\r\nMDCCCC\r\n\r\n1900\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of this volume is to sketch the history of the monastic\r\ninstitution from its origin to its overthrow in the Reformation period,\r\nfor although the institution is by no means now extinct, its power was\r\npractically broken in the sixteenth century, and no new orders of\r\nimportance or new types have arisen since that time.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will enable one to understand the great difficulties\r\nin the execution of so broad a purpose. It was impracticable in the\r\nmajority of instances to consult original sources, although intermediate\r\nauthorities have been studied as widely as possible and the greatest\r\ncaution has been exercised to avoid those errors which naturally arise\r\nfrom the use of such avenues of information. It was also deemed\r\nunadvisable to burden the work with numerous notes and citations. Such\r\nnotes as were necessary to a true unfolding of the subject will be found\r\nin the appendix.\r\n\r\nA presentation of the salient features of the whole history was\r\nessential to a proper conception of the orderly development of the\r\nascetic ideal. To understand the monastic institution one must not only\r\nstudy the isolated anchorite seeking a victory over a sinful self in the\r\nEgyptian desert or the monk in the secluded cloister, but he must also\r\ntrace the fortunes of ascetic organizations, involving multitudes of\r\nmen, vast aggregations of wealth, and surviving the rise and fall of\r\nempires. Almost every phase of human life is encountered in such an\r\nundertaking. Attention is divided between hermits, beggars,\r\ndiplomatists, statesmen, professors, missionaries and pontiffs. It is\r\nhoped the critical or literary student will appreciate the immense\r\ndifficulties of an attempt to paint so vast a scene on so small a\r\ncanvas. No other claim is made upon his benevolence.\r\n\r\nThere is a process of writing history which Trench describes as \"a moral\r\nwhitewashing of such things as in men's sight were as blackamoors\r\nbefore.\" Religious or temperamental prejudice often obscures the vision\r\nand warps the judgment of even the most scholarly minds. Conscious of\r\nthis infirmity in the ablest writers of history it would be absurd to\r\nclaim complete exemption from the power of personal bias. It is\r\nsincerely hoped, however, that the strongest passion in the preparation\r\nof this work has been that commendable predilection for truth and\r\njustice which should characterize every historical narrative, and that,\r\nwhatever other shortcomings may be found herein, there is an absence of\r\nthat unreasonable suspicion, not to say hatred, of everything monastic,\r\nwhich mars many otherwise valuable contributions to monastic history.\r\n\r\nThe author's grateful acknowledgment is made, for kindly services and\r\ncritical suggestions, to Eri Baker Hulbert, D.D., LL.D., Dean of the\r\nDivinity School, and Professor and Head of the Department of Church\r\nHistory; Franklin Johnson, D.D., LL.D., Professor of Church History and\r\nHomiletics; Benjamin S.

He was a pupil of Cabanel, Mils and Pils. He was\r\n     awarded the second-class medal in 1875, was made Chevalier of\r\n     the Legion of Honor in 1884, received the silver medal at the\r\n     Universal Exposition of 1889, and was created an Officer of\r\n     the Legion of Honor in 1897.

He was an engraver of portraits, landscapes and\r\n     architecture, and a clever manipulator of the burin. For a\r\n     time he held the position of \"Geographical Engraver\" to the\r\n     Departments of Marine, Fortifications and Forests. He was a\r\n     member of the French Geographical and Mathematical\r\n     Societies.]--_Nagler_.\r\n\r\nSAINT DOMINIC, .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    230\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph of Bozzani's painting, preserved in his cell at\r\nSanta Sabina, Rome.

Nagler, however,\r\n     tells of a painter of portraits and historical subjects,\r\n     Carlo Bozzoni by name, who was born in 1607 and died in 1657.\r\n     He was a son of Luciano Bozzoni, a Genoese painter and\r\n     engraver. He is said to have done good work, but no other\r\n     mention is made of him.]\r\n\r\nIGNATIUS DE LOYOLA,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    261\r\n\r\nAfter the engraving by Greatbach, \"from a scarce print by H.\r\nWierz.\" Originally published by Richard Bentley, London, in 1842.\r\n\r\n     [W. Greatbach was a London engraver in the first half of the\r\n     nineteenth century. He worked chiefly for the \"calendars\" and\r\n     \"annuals\" of his time, and did notable work for the general\r\n     book trade of the better class.]\r\n\r\n     [A search of the authorities does not reveal an engraver\r\n     named \"H. Wierz.\" This is probably intended for Hieronymus\r\n     Wierex (or Wierix, according to Bryant), a famous engraver,\r\n     born in 1552, and who is credited by Nagler, in his\r\n     \"Künstler-Lexikon,\" with having produced \"a beautiful and\r\n     rare plate\" of \"St. Ignaz von Loyola.\" The error, if such it\r\n     be, is easily explained by the fact that portrait engravers\r\n     seldom cut the lettering of a plate themselves, but have it\r\n     engraved by others, who have a special aptitude for making\r\n     shapely letters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nADAMS, G.B.: Civilization during the Middle Ages.\r\nARCHER, T.A., and KINGSFORD, CHARLES L.: The Crusaders.\r\nBARROWS, JOHN H., (Editor): The World's Parliment of Religions.\r\nBLUNT, I.J.: Sketches of the Reformation in England.\r\nBLUNT, JOHN HENRY: The Reformation of the Church of England,\r\n  its History, Principles and Results.\r\nBREWER, JOHN SHERREN: The Reign of Henry VIII.\r\nBRYCE, JAMES: The Holy Roman Empire.\r\nBURNET, GILBERT: History of the Reformation of the Church of\r\n  England.\r\nBUTLER, ALBAN: Lives of the Saints.\r\nCARLYLE, THOMAS: Past and Present: The Ancient Monk.

Every great religion in ancient and modern times has\r\nexpressed itself in some form of monastic life.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the institution is lost in antiquity. Its genesis and\r\ngradual progress through the centuries are like the movement of a mighty\r\nriver springing from obscure sources, but gathering volume by the\r\ncontributions of a multitude of springs, brooks, and lesser rivers,\r\nentering the main stream at various stages in its progress. While the\r\nmysterious source of the monastic stream may not be found, it is easy to\r\ndiscover many different influences and causes that tended to keep the\r\nmighty current flowing majestically on. It is not so easy to determine\r\nwhich of these forces was the greatest.\r\n\r\n\"Monasticism,\" says Schaff, \"proceeds from religious seriousness,\r\nenthusiasm and ambition; from a sense of the vanity of the world, and an\r\ninclination of noble souls toward solitude, contemplation, and freedom\r\nfrom the bonds of the flesh and the temptations of the world.\" A strong\r\nascetic tendency in human nature, particularly active in the Orient,\r\nundoubtedly explains in a general way the origin and growth of the\r\ninstitution. Various forms of philosophy and religious belief fostered\r\nthis monastic inclination from time to time by imparting fresh impetus\r\nto the desire for soul-purity or by deepening the sense of disgust with\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIndia is thought by some to have been the birthplace of the institution.\r\nIn the sacred writings of the venerable Hindûs, portions of which have\r\nbeen dated as far back as 2400 B.C., there are numerous legends about\r\nholy monks and many ascetic rules. Although based on opposite\r\nphilosophical principles, the earlier Brahminism and the later system,\r\nBuddhism, each tended toward ascetic practices, and they each boast\r\nto-day of long lines of monks and nuns.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo (Brahmin) ascetic, or naked philosopher, as the Greeks called\r\nhim, exhausted his imagination in devising schemes of self-torture. He\r\nburied himself with his nose just above the ground, or wore an iron\r\ncollar, or suspended weights from his body. He clenched his fists until\r\nthe nails grew into his palms, or kept his head turned in one direction\r\nuntil he was unable to turn it back. He was a miracle-worker, an oracle\r\nof wisdom, and an honored saint. He was bold, spiritually proud, capable\r\nof almost superhuman endurance. We will meet him again in the person of\r\nhis Christian descendant on the banks of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist ascetic was, perhaps, less severe with himself, but the\r\ngeneral spirit and form of the institution was and is the same as among\r\nthe Brahmins. In each religion we observe the same selfish\r\nindividualism,--a desire to save one's own soul by slavish obedience to\r\nascetic rules,--the extinction of natural desires by self-punishment.\r\n\"A Brahmin who wishes to become an ascetic,\" says Clarke, \"must abandon\r\nhis home and family and go live in the forest. His food must be roots\r\nand fruit, his clothing a bark garment or a skin, he must bathe morning\r\nand evening, and suffer his hair to grow.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact to be remembered, however, is that in India, centuries before\r\nthe Christian Era, there existed both phases of Christian monasticism,\r\nthe hermit[A] and the crowded convent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Appendix, Note A.]\r\n\r\nDhaquit, a Chaldean ascetic, who is said to have lived about 2000 B.C.,\r\nis reported to have earnestly rebuked those who tried to preserve the\r\nbody from decay by artificial resources. \"Not by natural means,\" he\r\nsaid, \"can man preserve his body from corruption and dissolution after\r\ndeath, but only through good deeds, religious exercises and offering of\r\nsacrifices,--by invoking the gods by their great and beautiful names, by\r\nprayers during the night, and fasts during the day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Father Bury, a Portuguese missionary, first saw the Chinese bonzes,\r\ntonsured and using their rosaries, he cried out, \"There is not a single\r\narticle of dress, or a sacerdotal function, or a single ceremony of the\r\nRomish church, which the Devil has not imitated in this country.\" I have\r\nnot the courage to follow this streamlet back into the devil's heart.\r\nThe attempt would be too daring. Who invented shaved heads and monkish\r\ngowns and habits, we cannot tell, but this we know: long before Father\r\nBury saw and described those things in China, there existed in India the\r\nGrand Lama or head monk, with monasteries under him, filled with monks\r\nwho kept the three vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. They had\r\ntheir routine of prayers, of fasts and of labors, like the Christian\r\nmonks of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks there were many philosophers who taught ascetic\r\nprinciples. Pythagoras, born about 580 B.C., established a religious\r\nbrotherhood in which he sought to realize a high ideal of friendship.\r\nHis whole plan singularly suggests monasticism. His rules provided for a\r\nrigid self-examination and unquestioning submission to a master. Many\r\nauthorities claim that the influence of the Pythagorean philosophy was\r\nstrongly felt in Egypt and Palestine, after the time of Christ. \"Certain\r\nit is that more than two thousand years before Ignatius Loyola assembled\r\nthe nucleus of his great society in his subterranean chapel in the city\r\nof Paris, there was founded at Crotona, in Greece, an order of monks\r\nwhose principles, constitution, aims, method and final end entitle them\r\nto be called 'The Pagan Jesuits[B].'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Appendix, Note B.]\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Plato, no doubt, had a powerful monastic influence,\r\nunder certain social conditions, upon later thinkers and upon those who\r\nyearned for victory over the flesh. Plato strongly insisted on an ideal\r\nlife in which higher pleasures are preferred to lower. Earthly thoughts\r\nand ambitions are to yield before a holy communion with the Divine. Some\r\nof his views \"might seem like broken visions of the future, when we\r\nthink of the first disciples who had all things in common, and, in later\r\ndays, of the celibate clergy, and the cloisteral life of the religious\r\norders.\" The effect of such philosophy in times of general corruption\r\nupon those who wished to acquire exceptional moral and intellectual\r\npower, and who felt unable to cope with the temptations of social life,\r\nmay be easily imagined. It meant, in many cases, a retreat from the\r\nworld to a life of meditation and soul-conflict. In later times it\r\nexercised a marked influence upon ascetic literature.\r\n\r\nComing closer to Christianity in time and in teaching, we find a Jewish\r\nsect, called Essenes, living in the region of the Dead Sea, which bore\r\nremarkable resemblances to Christian monasticism. The origin and\r\ndevelopment of this band, which numbered four thousand about the time of\r\nChrist, are unknown. Even the derivation of the name is in doubt, there\r\nbeing at least twenty proposed explanations. The sect is described by\r\nPhilo, an Alexandrian-Jewish philosopher, who was born about 25 B.C.,\r\nand by Josephus, the Jewish historian, who was born at Jerusalem A.D.\r\n37. These writers evidently took pains to secure the facts, and from\r\ntheir accounts, upon which modern discussions of the subject are largely\r\nbased, the following facts are gleaned.\r\n\r\nThe Essenes were a sect outside the Jewish ecclesiastical body, bound by\r\nstrict vows and professing an extraordinary purity. While there were no\r\nvows of extreme penance, they avoided cities as centers of immorality,\r\nand, with some exceptions, eschewed marriage. They held aloof from\r\ntraffic, oaths, slave-holding, and weapons of offence. They were strict\r\nSabbath observers, wore a uniform robe, possessed all things in common,\r\nengaged in manual labor, abstained from forbidden food, and probably\r\nrejected the bloody sacrifices of the Temple, although continuing to\r\nsend their thank-offerings. Novitiates were kept on probation three\r\nyears. The strictest discipline was maintained, excommunication\r\nfollowing detection in heinous sins. Evidently the standard of character\r\nwas pure and lofty, since their emphasis on self-mastery did not end in\r\nabsurd extravagances. Their frugal food, simple habits, and love of\r\ncleanliness; combined with a regard for ethical principles, conduced to\r\na high type of life. Edersheim remarks, \"We can scarcely wonder that\r\nsuch Jews as Josephus and Philo, and such heathens as Pliny, were\r\nattracted by such an unworldly and lofty sect.\"\r\n\r\nSome writers maintain that they were also worshipers of the sun, and\r\nhence that their origin is to be traced to Persian sources. Even if so,\r\nthey seemed to have escaped that confused and mystical philosophy which\r\nhas robbed Oriental thought of much power in the realm of practical\r\nlife. Philo says, \"Of philosophy, the dialectical department, as being\r\nin no wise necessary for the acquisition of virtue, they abandon to the\r\nword-catchers; and the part which treats of the nature of things, as\r\nbeing beyond human nature, they leave to speculative air-gazers, with\r\nthe exception of that part of it which deals with the subsistance of God\r\nand the genesis of all things; but the ethical they right well\r\nwork out.\"\r\n\r\nPliny the elder, who lived A.D. 23-79, made the following reference to\r\nthe Essenes, which is especially interesting because of the tone of\r\nsadness and weariness with the world suggested in its praise of this\r\nJewish sect. \"On the western shore (of the Dead Sea) but distant from\r\nthe sea far enough to escape from its noxious breezes, dwelt the\r\nEssenes. They are an eremite clan, one marvelous beyond all others in\r\nthe whole world; without any women, with sexual intercourse entirely\r\ngiven up, without money, and the associates of palm trees. Daily is the\r\nthrong of those that crowd about them renewed, men resorting to them in\r\nnumbers, driven through weariness of existence, and the surges of\r\nill-fortune, to their manner of life. Thus it is that through thousands\r\nof ages--incredible to relate!--their society, in which no one is born,\r\nlives on perennial. So fruitful to them is the irksomeness of life\r\nexperienced by other men.\"\r\n\r\nAdmission to the order was granted only to adults, yet children were\r\nsometimes adopted for training in the principles of the sect. Some\r\nbelieved in marriage as a means of perpetuating the order.\r\n\r\nSince it would not throw light on our present inquiry, the mooted\r\nquestion as to the connection of Essenism and the teachings of Jesus may\r\nbe passed by. The differences are as great as the resemblances and the\r\nweight of opinion is against any vital relation.\r\n\r\nThe character of this sect conclusively shows that some of the elements\r\nof Christian monasticism existed in the time of Jesus, not only in\r\nPalestine but in other countries. In an account of the Therapeutæ, or\r\ntrue devotees, an ascetic body similar to the Essenes, Philo says,\r\n\"There are many parts of the world in which this class may be found....\r\nThey are, however, in greatest abundance in Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Apostolic times various teachings and practices were current that\r\nmay be characterized as ascetic. The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the\r\nColossians, doubtless had in mind a sect or school which despised the\r\nbody and abstained from meats and wine. A false asceticism, gathering\r\ninspiration from pagan philosophy, was rapidly spreading among\r\nChristians even at that early day. The teachings of the Gnostics, a\r\nspeculative sect of many schools, became prominent in the closing days\r\nof the Apostolic age or very soon thereafter. Many of these schools\r\nclaimed a place in the church, and professed a higher life and knowledge\r\nthan ordinary Christians possessed. The Gnostics believed in the\r\ncomplete subjugation of the body by austere treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Montanists, so called after Montanus, their famous leader, arose in\r\nAsia Minor during the second century, when Marcus Aurelius was emperor.\r\nSchaff describes the movement as \"a morbid exaggeration of Christian\r\nideas and demands.\" It was a powerful and frantic protest against the\r\ngrowing laxity of the church. It despised ornamental dress and\r\nprescribed numerous fasts and severities.\r\n\r\nThese facts and many others that might be mentioned throw light on our\r\ninquiry in several ways. They show that asceticism was in the air. The\r\nliterature, philosophy and religion of the day drifted toward an ascetic\r\nscheme of life and stimulated the tendency to acquire holiness, even at\r\nthe cost of innocent joys and natural gratifications. They show that\r\nworldliness was advancing in the church, which called for rebuke and a\r\nreturn to Apostolic Christianity; that the church was failing to satisfy\r\nthe highest cravings of the soul. True, it was well-nigh impossible for\r\nthe church, in the midst of such a powerful and corrupt heathen\r\nenvironment, to keep itself up to its standards.\r\n\r\nIt is a common tradition that in the first three centuries the practices\r\nand spirit of the church were comparatively pure and elevated. Harnack\r\nsays, \"This tradition is false. The church was already secularized to a\r\ngreat extent in the middle of the third century.\" She was \"no longer in\r\na position to give peace to all sorts and conditions of men.\" It was\r\nthen that the great exodus of Christians from the villages and cities to\r\nmountains and deserts began. Although from the time of Christ on there\r\nwere always some who understood Christianity to demand complete\r\nseparation from all earthly pleasures, yet it was three hundred years\r\nand more before large numbers began to adopt a hermit's life as the only\r\nmethod of attaining salvation. \"They fled not only from the world, but\r\nfrom the world within the church. Nevertheless, they did not flee out of\r\nthe church.\"\r\n\r\nWe can now see why no definite cause for the monastic institution can be\r\ngiven and no date assigned for its origin. It did not commence at any\r\nfixed time and definite place. Various philosophies and religious\r\ncustoms traveled for centuries from country to country, resulting in\r\nsingular resemblances and differences between different ascetic or\r\nmonastic sects. Christian monasticism was slowly evolved, and gradually\r\nassumed definite organization as a product of a curious medley of\r\nHeathen-Jewish-Christian influences.\r\n\r\nA few words should be said here concerning the influence of the Bible\r\nupon monasticism. Naturally the Christian hermits and early fathers\r\nappealed to the Bible in support of their teachings and practices. It is\r\nnot necessary, at this point, to discuss the correctness of their\r\ninterpretations. The simple fact is that many passages of scripture were\r\nconsidered as commands to attain perfection by extraordinary sacrifices,\r\nand certain Biblical characters were reverenced as shining monastic\r\nmodels. In the light of the difficulties of Biblical criticism it is\r\neasy to forgive them if they were mistaken, a question to be discussed\r\nfarther on. They read of those Jewish prophets described in Hebrews:\r\n\"They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; ... wandering in deserts\r\nand mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.\" They pointed to\r\nElijah and his school of prophets; to John the Baptist, with his raiment\r\nof camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, whose meat was\r\nlocusts and wild honey. They recalled the commandment of Jesus to the\r\nrich young man to sell all his possessions and give to the poor. They\r\nquoted the words, \"Take no thought for the morrow what ye shall eat and\r\nwhat ye shall drink or wherewithal ye shall be clothed.\" They construed\r\nfollowing Christ to mean in His own words, \"forsaking father, mother,\r\nbrethren, wife, children, houses and lands.\" They pointed triumphantly\r\nto the Master himself, unmarried and poor, who had not \"where to lay his\r\nhead.\" They appealed to Paul's doctrine of marriage. They remembered\r\nthat the Church at Jerusalem was composed of those who sold their\r\npossessions and had all things in common. Whatever these and numerous\r\nother passages may truly mean, they interpreted them in favor of a\r\nmonastic mode of life; they understood them to teach isolation,\r\nfastings, severities, and other forms of rigorous self-denial. Accepting\r\nScripture in this sense, they trampled upon human affection and gave\r\naway their property, that they might please God and save their souls.\r\n\r\nBetween the time of Christ and Paul of Thebes, who died in the first\r\nhalf of the fourth century, and who is usually recognized as the founder\r\nof monasticism, many Christian disciples voluntarily abandoned their\r\nwealth, renounced marriage and adopted an ascetic mode of life, while\r\nstill living in or near the villages or cities. As the corruption of\r\nsociety and the despair of men became more widespread, these anxious\r\nChristians wandered farther and farther away from fixed habitations\r\nuntil, in an excess of spiritual fervor, they found themselves in the\r\ncaves of the mountains, desolate and dreary, where no sound of human\r\nvoice broke in upon the silence. The companions of wild beasts, they\r\nlived in rapt contemplation on the eternal mysteries of this most\r\nstrange world.\r\n\r\nMy task now is to describe some of those recluses who still live in the\r\nbiographies of the saints and the traditions of the church. Ducis, while\r\nreading of these hermits, wrote to a friend as follows: \"I am now\r\nreading the lives of the Fathers of the Desert. I am dwelling with St.\r\nPachomius, the founder of the monastery at Tabenna. Truly there is a\r\ncharm in transporting one's self to that land of the angels--one could\r\nnot wish ever to come out of it.\" Whether the reader will call these\r\nstrange characters angels, and will wish he could have shared their beds\r\nof stone and midnight vigils, I will not venture to say, but at all\r\nevents his visit will be made as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\nIn writing the life of Mahomet, Carlyle said, \"As there is no danger of\r\nour becoming, any of us, Mahometans, I mean to say all the good of\r\nMahomet I justly can.\" So, without distorting the picture that has come\r\ndown to us, I mean to say all the good of these Egyptian hermits that\r\nthe facts will justify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hermits of Egypt_\r\n\r\nEgypt was the mother of Christian monasticism, as she has been of many\r\nother wonders.\r\n\r\nVast solitudes; lonely mountains, honey-combed with dens and caves; arid\r\nvalleys and barren hills; dreary deserts that glistened under the\r\nblinding glare of the sun that poured its heat upon them steadily all\r\nthe year; strange, grotesque rocks and peaks that assumed all sorts of\r\nfantastic shapes to the overwrought fancy; in many places no water, no\r\nverdure, and scarcely a thing in motion; the crocodile and the bird\r\nlazily seeking their necessary food and stirring only as compelled;\r\nunbounded expanse in the wide star-lit heavens; unbroken quiet on the\r\nlonely mountains--a fit home for the hermit, a paradise to the lover of\r\nsolitude and peace.\r\n\r\nOf life under such conditions Kingsley has said: \"They enjoyed nature,\r\nnot so much for her beauty as for her perfect peace. Day by day the\r\nrocks remained the same. Silently out of the Eastern desert, day by day,\r\nthe rising sun threw aloft those arrows of light which the old Greeks\r\nhad named 'the rosy fingers of the dawn.' Silently he passed in full\r\nblaze above their heads throughout the day, and silently he dipped\r\nbehind the Western desert in a glory of crimson and orange, green and\r\npurple.... Day after day, night after night, that gorgeous pageant\r\npassed over the poor hermit's head without a sound, and though sun, moon\r\nand planet might change their places as the years rolled round, the\r\nearth beneath his feet seemed not to change.\" As for the companionless\r\nmen, who gazed for years upon this glorious scene, they too were of\r\nunusual character, Waddington finely says: \"The serious enthusiasm of\r\nthe natives of Egypt and Asia, that combination of indolence and energy,\r\nof the calmest languor with the fiercest passions, ... disposed them to\r\nembrace with eagerness the tranquil but exciting duties of religious\r\nseclusion.\" Yes, here are the angels of Ducis in real flesh and blood.\r\nThey revel in the wildest eccentricities with none to molest or make\r\nafraid, always excepting the black demons from the spiritual world. One\r\ndwells in a cave in the bowels of the earth; one lies on the sand\r\nbeneath a blazing sun; one has shut himself forever from the sight of\r\nman in a miserable hut among the bleak rocks of yonder projecting peak;\r\none rests with joy in the marshes, breathing with gratitude the\r\npestilential vapors.\r\n\r\nSome of these saints became famous for piety and miraculous power.\r\nAthanasius, fleeing from persecution, visited them, and Jerome sought\r\nthem out to learn from their own lips the stories of their lives. To\r\nthese men and to others we are indebted for much of our knowledge\r\nconcerning this chapter of man's history. Less than fifty years after\r\nPaul of Thebes died, or about 375 A.D., Jerome wrote the story of his\r\nlife, which Schaff justly characterizes as \"a pious romance.\" From\r\nJerome we gather the following account: Paul was the real founder of the\r\nhermit life, although not the first to bear the name. During the Decian\r\npersecution, when churches were laid waste and Christians were slain\r\nwith barbarous cruelty, Paul and his sister were bereaved of both their\r\nparents. He was then a lad of sixteen, an inheritor of wealth and\r\nskilled for one of his years in Greek and Egyptian learning. He was of a\r\ngentle and loving disposition. On account of his riches he was denounced\r\nas a Christian by an envious brother-in-law and compelled to flee to the\r\nmountains in order to save his life. He took up his abode in a cave\r\nshaded by a palm that afforded him food and clothing. \"And that no one\r\nmay deem this impossible,\" affirms Jerome, \"I call to witness Jesus and\r\nhis holy angels that I have seen and still see in that part of the\r\ndesert which lies between Syria and the Saracens' country, monks of whom\r\none was shut up for thirty years and lived on barley bread and muddy\r\nwater, while another in an old cistern kept himself alive on five dried\r\nfigs a day.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine how much of the story which follows is\r\nhistorically true. Undoubtedly, it contains little worthy of belief, but\r\nit gives us some faint idea of how these hermits lived. Its chief value\r\nconsists in the fact that it preserves a fragment of the monastic\r\nliterature of the times--a story which was once accepted as a credible\r\nnarrative. Imagine the influence of such a tale, when believed to be\r\ntrue, upon a mind inclined to embrace the doctrines of asceticism. Its\r\npower at that time is not to be measured by its reliability now. Jerome\r\nhimself declares in the prologue that many incredible things were\r\nrelated of Paul which he will not repeat. After reading the following\r\nstory, the reader may well inquire what more fanciful tale could be\r\nproduced even by a writer of fiction.\r\n\r\nThe blessed Paul was now one hundred and thirteen years old, and\r\nAnthony, who dwelt in another place of solitude, was at the age of\r\nninety. In the stillness of the night it was revealed to Anthony that\r\ndeeper in the desert there was a better man than he, and that he ought\r\nto see him. So, at the break of day, the venerable old man, supporting\r\nand guiding his weak limbs with a staff, started out, whither he knew\r\nnot. At scorching noontide he beholds a fellow-creature, half man, half\r\nhorse, called by the poets Hippo-centaur. After gnashing outlandish\r\nutterances, this monster, in words broken, rather than spoken, through\r\nhis bristling lips, points out the way with his right hand and swiftly\r\nvanishes from the hermit's sight. Anthony, amazed, proceeds thoughtfully\r\non his way when a mannikin, with hooked snout, horned forehead and\r\ngoat's feet, stands before him and offers him food. Anthony asks who he\r\nis. The beast thus replies: \"I am a mortal being, and one of those\r\ninhabitants of the desert, whom the Gentiles deluded by various forms of\r\nerror worship, under the name of Fauns and Satyrs.\" As he utters these\r\nand other words, tears stream down the aged traveler's face! He rejoices\r\nover the glory of God and the destruction of Satan. Striking the ground\r\nwith his staff, he exclaims, \"Woe to thee, Alexandria, who, instead of\r\nGod, worshipest monsters! Woe to thee, harlot city, into which have\r\nflowed together the demons of the world! What will you say now? Beasts\r\nspeak of Christ, and you, instead of God, worship monsters.\" \"Let none\r\nscruple to believe this incident,\" says the chronicler, \"for a man of\r\nthis kind was brought alive to Alexandria and the people saw him; when\r\nhe died his body was preserved in salt and brought to Antioch that the\r\nEmperor might view him.\"\r\n\r\nAnthony continues to traverse the wild region into which he had entered.\r\nThere is no trace of human beings. The darkness of the second night\r\nwears away in prayer. At day-break he beholds far away a she-wolf\r\ngasping with parched thirst and creeping into a cave. He draws near and\r\npeers within. All is dark, but perfect love casteth out fear. With\r\nhalting step and bated breath, he enters. After a while a light gleams\r\nin the distant midnight darkness. With eagerness he presses forward, but\r\nhis foot strikes against a stone and arouses the echoes; whereupon the\r\nblessed Paul closes the door and makes it fast. For hours Anthony lay at\r\nthe door craving admission. \"I know I am not worthy,\" he humbly cries,\r\n\"yet unless I see you I will not turn away. You welcome beasts, why not\r\na man? If I fail, I will die here on your threshold.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Such was his constant cry; unmoved he stood,\r\n      To whom the hero thus brief answer made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayers like these do not mean threats, there is no trickery in tears.\"\r\nSo, with smiles, Paul gives him entrance and the two aged hermits fall\r\ninto each other's embrace. Together they converse of things human and\r\ndivine, Paul, close to the dust of the grave, asks, Are new houses\r\nspringing up in ancient cities? What government directs the world?\r\nLittle did this recluse know of his fellow-beings and how fared it with\r\nthe children of men who dwelt in those great cities around the blue\r\nMediterranean. He was dead to the world and knew it no more.\r\n\r\nA raven brought the aged brothers bread to eat and the hours glided\r\nswiftly away. Anthony returned to get a cloak which Athanasius had given\r\nhim in which to wrap the body of Paul. So eager was he to behold again\r\nhis newly-found friend that he set out without even a morsel of bread,\r\nthirsting to see him. But when yet three days' journey from the cave he\r\nsaw Paul on high among the angels. Weeping, he trudged on his way. On\r\nentering the cave he saw the lifeless body kneeling, with head erect and\r\nhands uplifted. He tenderly wrapped the body in the cloak and began to\r\nlament that he had no implements to dig a grave. But Providence sent two\r\nlions from the recesses of the mountain that came rushing with flying\r\nmanes. Roaring, as if they too mourned, they pawed the earth and thus\r\nthe grave was dug. Anthony, bending his aged shoulders beneath the\r\nburden of the saint's body, laid it lovingly in the grave and departed.\r\n\r\nJerome closes this account by challenging those who do not know the\r\nextent of their possessions,--who adorn their homes with marble and who\r\nstring house to house,--to say what this old man in his nakedness ever\r\nlacked. \"Your drinking vessels are of precious stones; he satisfied his\r\nthirst with the hollow of his hand. Your tunics are wrought of gold; he\r\nhad not the raiment of your meanest slave. But on the other hand, poor\r\nas he was, Paradise is open to him; you, with all your gold, will be\r\nreceived into Gehenna. He, though naked, yet kept the robe of Christ;\r\nyou, clad in your silks, have lost the vesture of Christ. Paul lies\r\ncovered with worthless dust, but will rise again to glory; over you are\r\nraised costly tombs, but both you and your wealth are doomed to burning.\r\nI beseech you, reader, whoever you may be, to remember Jerome the\r\nsinner. He, if God would give him his choice, would sooner take Paul's\r\ntunics with his merits, than the purple of kings with their punishment.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the story circulated among rich and poor, appealing with\r\nwondrous force to the hearts of men in those wretched years.\r\n\r\nWhat was the effect upon the mind of the thoughtful? If he believed such\r\nteaching, weary of the wickedness of the age, and moved by his noblest\r\nsentiments, he sold his tunics wrought of gold and fled from his palaces\r\nof marble to the desert solitudes.\r\n\r\nBut the monastic story that most strongly impressed the age now under\r\nconsideration, was the biography of Anthony, \"the patriarch of monks\"\r\nand virtual founder of Christian monasticism. It was said to have been\r\nwritten by Athanasius, the famous defender of orthodoxy and Archbishop\r\nof Alexandria; yet some authorities reject his authorship. It exerted a\r\npower over the minds of men beyond all human estimate. It scattered the\r\nseeds of asceticism wherever it was read. Traces of its influence are\r\nfound all over the Roman empire, in Egypt, Asia Minor, Palestine, Italy\r\nand Gaul. Knowing the character of Athanasius, we may rest assured that\r\nhe sincerely believed all he really recorded (it is much interpolated)\r\nof the strange life of Anthony, and, true or false, thousands of others\r\nbelieved in him and in his story. Augustine, the great theologian of\r\nimmortal fame, acknowledged that this book was one of the influences\r\nthat led to his conversion, and Jerome, whose life I will review later,\r\nwas mightily swayed by it.\r\n\r\nAnthony was born about 251 A.D., in Upper Egypt, of wealthy and noble\r\nparentage. He was a pious child, an obedient son, and a lover of\r\nsolitude and books. His parents died when he was about twenty years old,\r\nleaving to his care their home and his little sister. One day, as he\r\nentered the church, meditating on the poverty of Christ, a theme much\r\nreflected upon in those days, he heard these words read from the pulpit,\r\n\"If thou wouldst be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to\r\nthe poor, and come, follow me.\" As if the call came straight from heaven\r\nto his own soul, he left the church at once and made over his farm to\r\nthe people of the village. He sold his personal possessions for a large\r\nsum, and distributed the proceeds among the poor, reserving a little for\r\nhis sister. Still he was unsatisfied. Entering the church on another\r\noccasion, he heard our Lord saying in the gospel, \"Take no thought for\r\nthe morrow.\" The clouds cleared away. His anxious search for truth and\r\nduty was at an end. He went out and gave away the remnant of his\r\nbelongings. Placing his sister in a convent, the existence of which is\r\nto be noted, he fled to the desert. Then follows a striking statement,\r\n\"For monasteries were not common in Egypt, nor had any monk at all known\r\nthe great desert; but every one who wished to devote himself to his own\r\nspiritual welfare performed his exercise alone, not far from\r\nthe village.\"\r\n\r\nLaboring with his hands, recalling texts of Scripture, praying whole\r\nsleepless nights, fasting for several days at a time, visiting his\r\nfellow saints, fighting demons, so passed the long years away. He slept\r\non a small rush mat, more often on the bare ground. Forgetting past\r\nausterities, he was ever on the search for some new torture and pressing\r\nforward to new and strange experiences. He changed his habitation from\r\ntime to time. Now he lived in a tomb, in company with the silent dead;\r\nthen for twenty years in a deserted castle, full of reptiles, never\r\ngoing out and rarely seeing any one. From each saint he learned some\r\nfresh mode of spiritual training, observing his practice for future\r\nimitation and studying the charms of his Christian character that he\r\nmight reproduce them in his own life; thus he would return richly laden\r\nto his cell.\r\n\r\nBut in all these struggles Anthony had one foe--the arch-enemy of all\r\ngood. He suggests impure thoughts, but the saint repels them by prayer;\r\nhe incites to passion, but the hero resists the fiend with fastings and\r\nfaith. Once the dragon, foiled in his attempt to overcome Anthony,\r\ngnashed his teeth, and coming out of his body, lay at his feet in the\r\nshape of a little black boy. But the hermit was not beguiled into\r\ncarelessness by this victory. He resolved to chastise himself more\r\nseverely. So he retired to the tombs of the dead. One dark night a crowd\r\nof demons flogged the saint until he fell to the ground speechless with\r\ntorture. Some friends found him the next day, and thinking that he was\r\ndead, carried him to the village, where his kinsfolk gathered to mourn\r\nover his remains. But at midnight he came to himself, and, seeing but\r\none acquaintance awake, he begged that he would carry him back to the\r\ntombs, which was done. Unable to move, he prayed prostrate and sang, \"If\r\nan host be laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid.\" The\r\nenraged devils made at him again. There was a terrible crash; through\r\nthe walls the fiends came in shapes like beasts and reptiles. In a\r\nmoment the place was filled with lions roaring at him, bulls thrusting\r\nat him with their horns, creeping serpents unable to reach him, wolves\r\nheld back in the act of springing. There, too, were bears and asps and\r\nscorpions. Mid the frightful clamor of roars, growls and hisses, rose\r\nthe clear voice of the saint, as he triumphantly mocked the demons in\r\ntheir rage. Suddenly the awful tumult ceased; the wretched beings became\r\ninvisible and a ray of light pierced the roof to cheer the prostrate\r\nhero. His pains ceased. A voice came to him saying, \"Thou hast withstood\r\nand not yielded. I will always be thy helper, and will make thy name\r\nfamous everywhere.\" Hearing this he rose up and prayed, and was stronger\r\nin body than ever before.\r\n\r\nThis is but one of numerous stories chronicling Anthony's struggles with\r\nthe devil. Like conflicts were going on at that hour in many another\r\ncave in those great and silent mountains.\r\n\r\nThere are also wondrous tales of his miraculous power. He often\r\npredicted the coming of sufferers and healed them when they came. His\r\nfame for curing diseases and casting out devils became so extensive that\r\nEgypt marveled at his gifts, and saints came even from Rome to see his\r\nface and to hear his words. His freedom from pride and arrogance was as\r\nmarked as his fame was great. He yielded joyful obedience to presbyters\r\nand bishops. His countenance was so full of divine grace and heavenly\r\nbeauty as to render him easily distinguishable in a crowd of monks.\r\nLetters poured in upon him from every part of the empire. Kings wrote\r\nfor his advice, but it neither amazed him nor filled his heart with\r\npride. \"Wonder not,\" said he, \"if a king writes to us, for he is but a\r\nman, but wonder rather that God has written His law to man and spoken to\r\nus by His Son.\" At his command princes laid aside their crowns, judges\r\ntheir magisterial robes, while criminals forsook their lives of crime\r\nand embraced with joy the life of the desert.\r\n\r\nOnce, at the earnest entreaty of some magistrates, he came down from the\r\nmountain that they might see him. Urged to prolong his stay he refused,\r\nsaying, \"Fishes, if they lie long on the dry land, die; so monks who\r\nstay with you lose their strength. As the fishes, then, hasten to the\r\nsea, so must we to the mountains.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the shadows lengthened and waning strength proclaimed that his\r\ndeparture was nigh. Bidding farewell to his monks, he retired to an\r\ninner mountain and laid himself down to die. His countenance brightened\r\nas if he saw his friends coming to see him, and thus his soul was\r\ngathered to his fathers. He is said to have been mourned by fifteen\r\nthousand disciples.\r\n\r\nThis is the story which moved a dying empire. \"Anthony,\" says\r\nAthanasius, \"became known not by worldly wisdom, nor by any art, but\r\nsolely by piety, and that this was the gift of God who can deny?\" The\r\npurpose of such a life was, so his biographer thought, to light up the\r\nmoral path for men, that they might imbibe a zeal for virtue.\r\n\r\nThe \"Life of St. Anthony\" is even more remarkable for its omissions than\r\nfor its incredible tales. While I reserve a more detailed criticism of\r\nits Christian ideals until a subsequent chapter, it may be well to quote\r\nhere a few words from Isaac Taylor. After pointing out some of its\r\ndefects he continues: there is \"not a word of justification by faith;\r\nnot a word of the gracious influence of the Spirit in renewing and\r\ncleansing the heart; not a word responding to any of those signal\r\npassages of Scripture which make the Gospel 'Glad Tidings' to guilty\r\nmen.\" This I must confess to be true, even though I may and do heartily\r\nesteem the saint's enthusiasm for righteousness.\r\n\r\nSo far I have described chiefly the spiritual experiences of these men,\r\nbut the details of their physical life are hardly less interesting.\r\nThere was a holy rivalry among them to excel in self-torture. Their\r\nimaginations were constantly employed in devising unique tests of\r\nholiness and courage. They lived in holes in the ground or in dried up\r\nwells; they slept in thorn bushes or passed days and weeks without\r\nsleep; they courted the company of the wildest beasts and exposed their\r\nnaked bodies to the broiling sun. Macarius became angry because an\r\ninsect bit him and in penitence flung himself into a marsh where he\r\nlived for weeks. He was so badly stung by gnats and flies that his\r\nfriends hardly knew him. Hilarion, at twenty years of age, was more like\r\na spectre than a living man. His cell was only five feet high, a little\r\nlower than his stature. Some carried weights equal to eighty or one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds suspended from their bodies. Others slept\r\nstanding against the rocks. For three years, as it is recorded, one of\r\nthem never reclined. In their zeal to obey the Scriptures, they\r\noverlooked the fact that cleanliness is akin to godliness. It was their\r\nboast that they never washed. One saint would not even use water to\r\ndrink, but quenched his thirst with the dew that fell on the grass. St.\r\nAbraham never washed his face for fifty years. His biographer, not in\r\nthe least disturbed by the disagreeable suggestions of this\r\ncircumstance, proudly says, \"His face reflected the purity of his soul.\"\r\nIf so, one is moved to think that the inward light must indeed have been\r\npowerfully piercing, if it could brighten a countenance unwashed for\r\nhalf a century. There is a story about Abbot Theodosius who prayed for\r\nwater that his monks might drink. In response to his petition a stream\r\nburst from the rocks, but the foolish monks, overcome by a pitiful\r\nweakness for cleanliness, persuaded the abbot to erect a bath, when lo,\r\nthe stream dried. Supplications and repentance availed nothing. After a\r\nyear had passed, the monks, promising never again to insult Heaven by\r\nwishing for a bath, were granted a second Mosaic miracle.\r\n\r\nThus, unwashed, clothed in rags, their hair uncut, their faces unshaven,\r\nthey lived for years. No wonder that to their disordered fancy the\r\ndesert was filled with devils, the animals spake and Heaven sent angels\r\nto minister unto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pillar Saint_\r\n\r\nBut the strangest of all strange narratives yet remains. We turn from\r\nEgypt to Asia Minor to make the acquaintance of that saint whom Tennyson\r\nhas immortalized,--the idol of monarchs and the pride of the\r\nEast,--Saint Simeon Stylites. Stories grow rank around him like the\r\nluxuriant products of a tropical soil. How shall I briefly tell of this\r\nman, whom Theodoret, in his zeal, declares all who obey the Roman rule\r\nknow--the man who may be compared with Moses the Legislator, David the\r\nKing and Micah the Prophet? He lived between the years 390 and 459 A.D.\r\nHe was a shepherd's son, but at an early age entered a monastery. Here\r\nhe soon distinguished himself by his excessive austerities. One day he\r\nwent to the well, removed the rope from the bucket and bound it tightly\r\naround his body underneath his clothes. A few weeks later, the abbot,\r\nbeing angry with him because of his extreme self-torture, bade his\r\ncompanions strip him. What was his astonishment to find the rope from\r\nthe well sunk deeply into his flesh. \"Whence,\" he cried, \"has this man\r\ncome to us, wanting to destroy the rule of this monastery? I pray thee\r\ndepart hence.\"\r\n\r\nWith great trouble they unwound the rope and the flesh with it, and\r\ntaking care of him until he was well, they sent him forth to commence a\r\nlife of austerities that was to render him famous. He adopted various\r\nstyles of existence, but his miracles and piety attracted such crowds\r\nthat he determined to invent a mode of life which would deliver him from\r\nthe pressing multitudes. It is curious that he did not hide himself\r\naltogether if he really wished to escape notoriety; but, no, he would\r\nstill be within the gaze of admiring throngs. His holy and fanciful\r\ngenius hit upon a scheme that gave him his peculiar name. He took up his\r\nabode on the top of a column which was at first about twelve feet high,\r\nbut was gradually elevated until it measured sixty-four feet. Hence, he\r\nis called Simeon Stylites, or Simeon the Pillar Saint.\r\n\r\nOn this lofty column, betwixt earth and heaven, the hermit braved the\r\nheat and cold of thirty years. At its base, from morning to night,\r\nprayed the admiring worshipers. Kings kneeled in crowds of peasants to\r\ndo him homage and ask his blessing. Theodoret says, \"The Ishmaelites,\r\ncoming by tribes of two hundred and three hundred at a time, and\r\nsometimes even a thousand, deny, with shouts, the error of their\r\nfathers, and breaking in pieces before that great illuminator, the\r\nimages which they had worshiped, and renouncing the orgies of Venus,\r\nthey received the Divine sacrament.\" Rude barbarians confessed their\r\nsins in tears. Persians, Greeks, Romans and Saracens, forgetting their\r\nmutual hatred, united in praise and prayer at the feet of this strange\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOnce a week the hero partook of food. Many times a day he bowed his head\r\nto his feet; one man counted twelve hundred and forty-four times and\r\nthen stopped in sheer weariness from gazing at the miracle of endurance\r\naloft. Again, from the setting of the sun to its appearance in the East,\r\nhe would stand unsoothed by sleep with his arms outstretched like\r\na cross.\r\n\r\nIf genius can understand such a life as that and fancy the thoughts of\r\nsuch a soul, Tennyson seems not only to have comprehended the\r\nconsciousness of the Pillar Saint, but also to have succeeded in giving\r\nexpression to his insight. He has laid bare the soul of Simeon in its\r\ncommingling of spiritual pride with affected humility, and of a\r\nconsciousness of meritorious sacrifice with a sense of sin. The Saint\r\nspurns notoriety and the homage of men, yet exults in his control over\r\nthe multitudes.\r\n\r\nThe poet thus imagines Simeon to speak as the Saint is praying God to\r\ntake away his sin:\r\n\r\n     \"But yet\r\n     Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints\r\n     Enjoy themselves in heaven, and men on earth\r\n     House in the shade of comfortable roofs,\r\n     Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,\r\n     And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,\r\n     I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light,\r\n     Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,\r\n     To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints;\r\n     Or in the night, after a little sleep,\r\n     I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet\r\n     With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost.\r\n     I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back;\r\n     A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;\r\n     And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,\r\n     And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:\r\n     O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin.\r\n\r\n     O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;\r\n     A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:\r\n     'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;\r\n     Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,\r\n     That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!\r\n     They think that I am somewhat. What am I?\r\n     The silly people take me for a saint,\r\n     And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:\r\n     And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)\r\n     Have all in all endured as much, and more\r\n     Than many just and holy men, whose names\r\n     Are register'd and calendared for saints.\r\n\r\n     Good people, you do ill to kneel to me.\r\n     What is it I can have done to merit this?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Yet do not rise; for you may look on me,\r\n     And in your looking you may kneel to God.\r\n     Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd?\r\n     I think you know I have some power with Heaven\r\n     From my long penance: let him speak his wish.\r\n\r\n     Yes, I can heal him. Power goes forth from me.\r\n     They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout\r\n     'St. Simeon Stylites.' Why, if so,\r\n     God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,\r\n     God reaps a harvest in thee.  If this be,\r\n     Can I work miracles and not be saved?\"\r\n\r\nOnce, the devil, in shape like an angel, riding in a chariot of fire,\r\ncame to carry Simeon to the skies. He whispered to the weary Saint,\r\n\"Simeon, hear my words, which the Lord hath commanded thee. He has sent\r\nme, his angel, that I may carry thee away as I carried Elijah.\" Simeon\r\nwas deceived, and lifted his foot to step out into the chariot, when the\r\nangel vanished, and in punishment for his presumption an ulcer appeared\r\nupon his thigh.\r\n\r\nBut time plays havoc with saints as well as sinners, and death slays the\r\nstrongest. Bowed in prayer, his weary heart ceased to beat and the eyes\r\nthat gazed aloft were closed forever. Anthony, his beloved disciple,\r\nascending the column, found that his master was no more. Yet, it seemed\r\nas if Simeon was loath to leave the spot, for his spirit appeared to his\r\nweeping follower and said, \"I will not leave this column, and this\r\nblessed mountain. For I have gone to rest, as the Lord willed, but do\r\nthou not cease to minister in this place and the Lord will repay thee\r\nin heaven.\"\r\n\r\nHis body was carried down the mountain to Antioch. Heading the solemn\r\nprocession were the patriarch, six bishops, twenty-one counts and six\r\nthousand soldiers, \"and Antioch,\" says Gibbon, \"revered his bones as\r\nher glorious ornament and impregnable defence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cenobites of the East_\r\n\r\nWe cannot linger with these hermits. I pass now to the cenobitic[C]\r\nlife. We go back in years and return to Egypt. Man is a social animal,\r\nand the social instinct is so strong that even hermits are swayed by its\r\npower and get tired of living apart from one another. When Anthony died\r\nthe deserts were studded with hermitages, and those of exceptional fame\r\nwere surrounded by little clusters of huts and dens. Into these cells\r\ncrowded the hermits who wished to be near their master.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Appendix, Note C.]\r\n\r\nThus, step by step, organized or cenobitic monasticism easily and\r\nnaturally came into existence. The anchorites crawled from their dens\r\nevery day to hear the words of their chief saint,--a practice giving\r\nrise to stated meetings, with rules for worship. Regulations as to\r\nmeals, occupations, dress, penances, and prayers naturally follow.\r\n\r\nThe author of the first monastic rules is said to have been Pachomius,\r\nwho was born in Egypt about the year 292 A.D. He was brought up in\r\npaganism but was converted in early life while in the army. On his\r\ndischarge he retired with a hermit to Tabenna, an island in the Nile. It\r\nis said he never ate a full meal after his conversion, and for fifteen\r\nyears slept sitting on a stone. Natural gifts fitted him to become a\r\nleader, and it was not long before he was surrounded by a congregation\r\nof monks for whom he made his rules.\r\n\r\nThe monks of Pachomius were divided into bands of tens and hundreds,\r\neach tenth man being an under officer in turn subject to the hundredth,\r\nand all subject to the superior or abbot of the mother house. They lived\r\nthree in a cell, and a congregation of cells constituted a laura or\r\nmonastery. There was a common room for meals and worship. Each monk wore\r\na close fitting tunic and a white goatskin upper garment which was never\r\nlaid aside at meals or in bed, but only at the Eucharist. Their food\r\nusually consisted of bread and water, but occasionally they enjoyed such\r\nluxuries as oil, salt, fruits and vegetables. They ate in silence, which\r\nwas sometimes broken by the solemn voice of a reader.\r\n\r\n\"No man,\" says Jerome, \"dares look at his neighbor or clear his throat.\r\nSilent tears roll down their cheeks, but not a sob escapes their lips.\"\r\nTheir labors consisted of some light handiwork or tilling the fields.\r\nThey grafted trees, made beehives, twisted fish-lines, wove baskets and\r\ncopied manuscripts. It was early apparent that as man could not live\r\nalone so he could not live without labor. We shall see this principle\r\nemphasized more clearly by Benedict, but it is well to notice that at\r\nthis remote day provision was made for secular employments. Jerome\r\nenjoins Rusticus, a young monk, always to have some work on hand that\r\nthe devil may find him busy. \"Hoe your ground,\" says he, \"set out\r\ncabbages; convey water to them in conduits, that you may see with your\r\nown eyes the lovely vision of the poet,--\r\n\r\n     \"Art draws fresh water from the hilltop near,\r\n     Till the stream, flashing down among the rocks,\r\n     Cools the parched meadows and allays their thirst.\"\r\n\r\nThere were individual cases of excessive self-torture even among these\r\ncongregations of monks but we may say that ordinarily, organized\r\nmonasticism was altogether less severe upon the individual than\r\nanchoretic life. The fact that the monk was seeking human fellowship is\r\nevidence that he was becoming more humane, and this softening of his\r\nspirit betrayed itself in his treatment of himself. The aspect of life\r\nbecame a little brighter and happier.\r\n\r\nFour objects were comprehended in these monastic roles,--solitude,\r\nmanual labor, fasting and prayer. We need not pity these dwellers far\r\nfrom walled cities and the marts of trade. Indeed, they claim no\r\nsympathy. Religious ideals can make strange transformations in man's\r\ndisposition and tastes. They loved their hard lives.\r\n\r\nThe hermit Abraham said to John Cassian, \"We know that in these, our\r\nregions, there are some secret and pleasant places, where fruits are\r\nabundant and the beauty and fertility of the gardens would supply our\r\nnecessities with the slightest toil. We prefer the wilderness of this\r\ndesolation before all that is fair and attractive, admitting no\r\ncomparison between the luxuriance of the most exuberant soil and the\r\nbitterness of these sands.\" Jerome himself exclaimed, \"Others may think\r\nwhat they like and follow each his own bent. But to me a town is a\r\nprison and solitude paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThe three vows of chastity, poverty and obedience were adopted and\r\nbecame the foundation stones of the monastic institution, to be found in\r\nevery monastic order. There is a typical illustration in Kingsley's\r\nHypatia of what they meant by obedience. Philammon, a young monk, was\r\nconsigned to the care of Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, and a\r\nfactious, cruel man, with an imperious will. The bishop received and\r\nread his letter of introduction and thus addressed its bearer,\r\n\"Philammon, a Greek. You are said to have learned to obey. If so, you\r\nhave also learned to rule. Your father-abbot has transferred you to my\r\ntutelage. You are now to obey me.\" \"And I will,\" was the quick response.\r\n\"Well said. Go to that window and leap forth into the court.\" Philammon\r\nwalked to it and opened it. The pavement was fully twenty feet below,\r\nbut his business was to obey and not to take measurements. There was a\r\nflower in a vase upon the sill. He quietly removed it, and in an instant\r\nwould have leaped for life or death, when Cyril's voice\r\nthundered, \"Stop!\"\r\n\r\nThe Pachomian monks despised possessions of every kind. The following\r\npathetic incident shows the frightful extent to which they carried this\r\nprinciple, and also illustrates the character of that submission to\r\nwhich the novitiate voluntarily assented: Cassian described how Mutius\r\nsold his possessions and with his little child of eight asked admission\r\nto a monastery. The monks received but disciplined him. \"He had already\r\nforgotten that he was rich, he must forget that he was a father.\" His\r\nchild was taken, clothed in rags, beaten and spurned. Obedience\r\ncompelled the father to look upon his child wasting with pain and grief,\r\nbut such was his love for Christ, says the narrator, that his heart was\r\nrigid and immovable. He was then told to throw the boy into the river,\r\nbut was stopped in the act of obeying.\r\n\r\nYet men, women, and even children, coveted this life of unnatural\r\ndeprivations. \"Posterity,\" says Gibbon, \"might repeat the saying which\r\nhad formerly been applied to the sacred animals of the same country,\r\nthat in Egypt it was less difficult to find a god than a man.\" Though\r\nthe hermit did not claim to be a god, yet there were more monks in many\r\nmonasteries than inhabitants in the neighboring villages. Pachomius had\r\nfourteen hundred monks in his own monastery and seven thousand under his\r\nrule. Jerome says fifty thousand monks were sometimes assembled at\r\nEaster in the deserts of Nitria. It was not uncommon for an abbot to\r\ncommand five thousand monks. St. Serapion boasted of ten thousand.\r\nAltogether, so we are told, there were in the fifth century more than\r\none hundred thousand persons in the monasteries, three-fourths of\r\nwhom were men.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Pachomius spread over Egypt into Syria and Palestine. It was\r\ncarried by Athanasius into Italy and Gaul. It existed in various\r\nmodified forms until it was supplanted by the Benedictine rule.\r\n\r\nLeaving Egypt, again we cross the Mediterranean into Asia Minor. Near\r\nthe Black Sea, in a wild forest abounding in savage rocks and gloomy\r\nravines, there dwelt a young man of twenty-six. He had traveled in\r\nEgypt, Syria and Palestine. He had visited the hermits of the desert and\r\nstudied philosophy and eloquence in cultured Athens. In virtue eminent,\r\nin learning profound, this poetic soul sought to realize its ideal in a\r\nlonely and cherished retreat--in a solitude of Pontus.\r\n\r\nThe young monk is the illustrious saint and genius,--Basil the\r\nGreat,--the Bishop of Cæsarea, and the virtual founder of the monastic\r\ninstitution in the Greek church. The forest and glens around his hut\r\nbelonged to him, and on the other bank of the river Iris his mother and\r\nsister were leading similar lives, having abandoned earthly honors in\r\npursuit of heaven. Hard crusts of bread appeased his hunger. No fires,\r\nexcept those which burned within his soul, protected him from the wintry\r\nblast. His years were few but well spent. After a while his powerful\r\nintellect asserted itself and he was led into a clearer view of the true\r\nspiritual life. His practical mind revolted against the gross ignorance\r\nand meaningless asceticism of Egypt. He determined to form an order that\r\nwould conform to the inner meaning of the Bible and to a more sensible\r\nconception of the religious life. For his time he was a wise legislator,\r\na cunning workman and a daring thinker. The modification of his ascetic\r\nideal was attended by painful struggles. Many an hour he spent with his\r\nbosom friend, Gregory of Nazianza, discussing the subject. The middle\r\ncourse which they finally adopted is thus neatly described by Gregory:\r\n\r\n     \"Long was the inward strife, till ended thus:\r\n     I saw, when men lived in the fretful world,\r\n     They vantaged other men, but missed the while\r\n     The calmness, and the pureness of their hearts.\r\n     They who retired held an uprighter post,\r\n     And raised their eyes with quiet strength toward heaven;\r\n     Yet served self only, unfraternally.\r\n     And so, 'twixt these and those, I struck my path,\r\n     To meditate with the free solitary,\r\n     Yet to live secular, and serve mankind.\"\r\n\r\nMonks in large numbers flocked to this mountain retreat of Basil's.\r\nThese he banded together in an organization, the remains of which still\r\nlive in the Greek church. So great is the influence of his life and\r\nteachings, \"that it is common though erroneous to call all Oriental\r\nmonks Basilians.\" His rules are drawn up in the form of answers to two\r\nhundred and three questions. He added to the three monastic vows a\r\nfourth, which many authorities claim now appeared for the first\r\ntime,--namely, that of irrevocable vows--once a monk, always a monk.\r\n\r\nBasil did not condemn marriage, but he believed that it was incompatible\r\nwith the highest spiritual attainments. For the Kingdom of God's sake it\r\nwas necessary to forsake all. \"Love not the world, neither the things of\r\nthe world,\" embraced to his mind the married state. By avoiding the\r\ncares of marriage a man was sure to escape, so he thought, the gross\r\nsensuality of the age. He struck at the dangers which attend the\r\npossession of riches, by enforcing poverty. An abbot was appointed over\r\nhis cloisters to whom absolute obedience was demanded. Everywhere men\r\nneeded this lesson of obedience. The discipline of the armies was\r\nrelaxed. The authority of religion was set at naught; laxity and\r\ndisorder prevailed even among the monks. They went roaming over the\r\ncountry controlled only by their whims. Insubordination had to be\r\nchecked or the monastic institution was doomed. Hence, Basil was\r\nparticular to enforce a respect for law and order.\r\n\r\nAltogether this was an honest and serious attempt to introduce fresh\r\npower into a corrupt age and to faithfully observe the Biblical commands\r\nas Basil understood them. The floods of iniquity were engulfing even the\r\nchurch. A new standard had to be raised and an inner circle of pious and\r\nzealous believers gathered from the multitude of half-pagan Christians,\r\nor all was lost.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of Greek monachism has little interest. In\r\nRussia, at a late date, the Greek monks served some purpose in keeping\r\nalive the national spirit under the Tartar yoke, but the practical\r\nbenefits to the East were few, in comparison with the vigorous life of\r\nthe Western monasticism.\r\n\r\nMontalembert, the brilliant champion of Christian monasticism, becomes\r\nan adverse critic of the system in the East, although it is noteworthy\r\nhe now speaks of monasticism as it appears in the Greek church, which he\r\nholds to be heretical; yet his indictment is quite true: \"They yielded\r\nto all the deleterious impulses of that declining society. They have\r\nsaved nothing, regenerated nothing, elevated nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWe have visited the hermit in the desert and in the monastery governed\r\nby its abbot and its rules. We must view the monk in one other aspect,\r\nthat of theological champion. Here the hermit and the monk of the\r\nmonastery meet on common ground. They were fighters, not debaters;\r\nfighters, not disciplined soldiers; fighters, not persuading Christians.\r\nThey swarmed down from the mountains like hungry wolves. They fought\r\nheretics, they fought bishops, they fought Roman authorities, they\r\nfought soldiers, and fought one another. Ignorant, fanatical and cruel,\r\nthey incited riots, disturbed the public peace and shed the blood\r\nof foes.\r\n\r\nTheological discord was made a thousand times more bitter by their\r\nparticipation in the controversies of the time. Furious monks became the\r\narmed champions of Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria. They insulted the\r\nprefect, drove out the Jews and, to the everlasting disgrace of the\r\nmonks, Cyril and the church, they dragged the lovely Hypatia from her\r\nlecture hall and slew her with all the cruelty satanic ingenuity could\r\ndevise. Against a background of black and angry sky she stands forth, as\r\na soul through whose reason God made himself manifest. Her unblemished\r\ncharacter, her learning and her grace forever cry aloud against an\r\northodoxy bereft alike of reason and of the spirit of the Nazarene.\r\n\r\nThe fighting monks crowded councils and forced decisions. They deposed\r\nhostile bishops or kept their favorites in power by murder and violence.\r\nTwo black-cowled armies met in Constantinople, and amid curses fought\r\nwith sticks and stones a battle of creeds. Cries of \"Holy! Holy! Holy!\"\r\nmingled with, \"It's the day of martyrdom! Down with the tyrant!\" The\r\nwhole East was kept in a feverish state. The Imperial soldiers confessed\r\ntheir justifiable fears when they said, \"We would rather fight with\r\nbarbarians than with these monks.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder our perplexity increases and it seems impossible to determine\r\nwhat these men really did for the cause of truth. We have been unable to\r\ndistinguish the hermit from the beasts of the fields. We hear his\r\ngroans, see his tears, and watch him struggle with demons. We are\r\ndisgusted with his filth, amused at his fancies, grieved at his\r\nsuperstition. We pity his agony and admire his courage. We watch the\r\nprogress of order and rule out of chaos. We see monasteries grow up\r\naround damp caves and dismal huts. We behold Simeon praying among the\r\nbirds of heaven, and look into the face of the young and handsome Basil,\r\nin whom the monastic institution of the East reaches the zenith of\r\nits power.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess a profound reverence for many of these men\r\ndetermined at all hazards to keep their souls unspotted from the world.\r\nI bow before a passion for righteousness ready to part with life itself\r\nif necessary. Yet the gross extravagances, the almost incredible\r\nabsurdities of their unnatural lives compel us to withhold our judgment.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, the strange life of those far-off years is an\r\neloquent testimony to the indestructible craving of the human soul for\r\nself-mastery and soul-purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_MONASTICISM IN THE WEST: ANTE-BENEDICTINE MONKS 340-480 A.D._\r\n\r\nWe are now to follow the fortunes of the monastic system from its\r\nintroduction in Rome to the time of Benedict of Nursia, the founder of\r\nthe first great monastic order.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who made\r\nChristianity the predominant religion in the Roman Empire, died in 337\r\nA.D. Three years later Rome heard, probably for the first time, an\r\nauthentic account of the Egyptian hermits. The story was carried to the\r\nEternal City by Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, one of the most\r\nremarkable characters in the early church, a man of surpassing courage\r\nand perseverance, an intrepid foe of heresy, \"heroic and invincible,\" as\r\nMilton styled him. Twenty of the forty-six years of his official life\r\nwere spent in banishment.\r\n\r\nAthanasius was an intimate friend of the hermit Anthony and a persistent\r\nadvocate of the ascetic ideal. When he fled to Rome, in 340, to escape\r\nthe persecutions of the Arians, he took with him two specimens of\r\nmonastic virtue--Ammonius and Isidore. These hermits, so filthy and\r\nsavage in appearance, albeit, as I trust, clean in heart, excited\r\ngeneral disgust, and their story of the tortures and holiness of their\r\nEgyptian brethren was received with derision. But men who had faced and\r\nconquered the terrors of the desert were not to be so easily repulsed.\r\nAided by other ascetic travelers from the East they persisted in their\r\npropaganda until contempt yielded to admiration. The enthusiasm of the\r\nuncouth hermits became contagious. The Christians in Rome now welcomed\r\nthe story of the recluses as a Divine call to abandon a dissolute\r\nsociety for the peace and joy of a desert life.\r\n\r\nBut before this transformation of public opinion can be appreciated, it\r\nis needful to know something of the social and religious condition of\r\nRome in the days when Athanasius and his hermits walked her streets.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering frightful persecutions for three centuries, the Church\r\nhad at last nominally conquered the Roman Empire; nominally, because\r\nalthough Christianity was to live, the Empire had to die. \"No medicine\r\ncould have prevented the diseased old body from dying. The time had\r\ncome. When the wretched inebriate embraces a spiritual religion with one\r\nfoot in the grave, with a constitution completely undermined, and the\r\nseeds of death planted, then no repentance or lofty aspiration can\r\nprevent physical death. It was so in Rome.\" The death-throes were long\r\nand lingering, as befits the end of a mighty giant, but death was\r\ncertain. There are many facts which explain the inability of a\r\nconquering faith to save a tottering empire, but it is impracticable for\r\nus to enter upon that wide field. Some help may be gained from that\r\nwhich follows.\r\n\r\nOf morals, Rome was destitute. She possessed the material remains and\r\nsuperficial acquirements of a proud civilization, such as great public\r\nhighways, marble palaces, public baths, temples and libraries. Elegance\r\nof manners and acquisitions of wealth indicate specious outward\r\nrefinement. But these things are not sufficient to guarantee the\r\npermanence of institutions or the moral welfare of a nation. In the\r\nsouls of men there was a fatal degeneracy. There was outward prosperity\r\nbut inward corruption.\r\n\r\nProfessor Samuel Dill, in his highly instructive work on \"Roman Society\r\nin the Last Century of the Western Empire,\" points out the fact that\r\nRome's fall was due to economic and political causes as well as to the\r\ndeterioration of her morals. A close study of these causes, however,\r\nwill reveal the presence of moral influences. Professor Dill says: \"The\r\ngeneral tendency of modern inquiry has to discover in the fall of that\r\naugust and magnificent organization, not a cataclysm, precipitated by\r\nthe impact of barbarous forces, but a process slowly prepared and\r\nevolved by internal and economic causes.\" Two of these causes were the\r\ndying out of municipal liberty and self-government, and the separation\r\nof the upper class from the masses by sharp distributions of wealth and\r\nprivilege. It is indeed true that these causes contributed to Rome's\r\nruin; that the central government was weak; that the civil service was\r\noppressive and corrupt; that the aristocratic class was selfish; and\r\nthat the small landed proprietors were steadily growing poorer and\r\nfewer, while, on the contrary, the upper or senatorial class was\r\nincreasing in wealth and power. But after due emphasis has been accorded\r\nto these destructive factors, it yet remains true that the want of\r\npublic spirit and the prevailing cultivated selfishness may be traced to\r\na decline of faith in those religious ideals that serve to stimulate the\r\nmoral life and thus preserve the national integrity.\r\n\r\nSociety was divided into three classes. It is computed that one-half the\r\npopulation were slaves. A large majority of the remainder were paupers,\r\nliving on public charity, and constituting a festering sore that\r\nthreatened the life of the social organism. The rich, who were\r\nrelatively few, squandered princely incomes in a single night, and\r\nexhausted their imaginations devising new and expensive forms of\r\nsensuous pleasure. The profligacy of the nobles almost surpasses\r\ncredibility, so that trustworthy descriptions read like works of\r\nfiction. Farrar says: \"A whole population might be trembling lest they\r\nshould be starved by the delay of an Alexandrian corn ship, while the\r\nupper classes were squandering a fortune at a single banquet, drinking\r\nout of myrrhine and jeweled vases worth hundreds of pounds, and feasting\r\non the brains of peacocks and the tongues of nightingales.\" The\r\nfrivolity of the social and political leaders of Rome, the insane thirst\r\nfor lust and luxury, the absence of seriousness in the face of\r\nfrightful, impending ruin, almost justify the epigram of Silvianus,\r\n\"Rome was laughing when she died.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On that hard pagan world disgust\r\n     And secret loathing fell;\r\n     Deep weariness and sated lust\r\n     Made human life a hell.\r\n     In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,\r\n     The Roman noble lay;\r\n     He drove abroad in furious guise\r\n     Along the Appian Way;\r\n     He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,\r\n     And crowned his hair with flowers\r\n     No easier nor no guicker past\r\n     The impracticable hours.\"\r\n\r\nPagan mythology and Pagan philosophy were powerless to resist this\r\ndownward tendency. Although Christianity had become the state religion,\r\nit was itself in great danger of yielding to the decay that prevailed.\r\nThe Empire was, in fact, but nominally Christian. Thousands of\r\necclesiastical adherents were half pagan in their spirit and practice.\r\nHarnack declares, \"They were too deeply affected by Christianity to\r\nabandon it, but too little to be Christians. Pure religious enthusiasm\r\nwaned, ideals received a new form, and the dependence and responsibility\r\nof individuals became weaker.\" Even ordinary courage had everywhere\r\ndeclined and the pleasures of the senses controlled the heart of\r\nChristian society.\r\n\r\nMany of the men who should have resisted this gross secularization of\r\nthe church, who ought to have set their faces against the departure from\r\napostolic ideals by exalting the standards of the earlier Christianity;\r\nthese men, the clergy of the Christian church, had deserted their post\r\nof duty and surrendered to the prevailing worldliness.\r\n\r\nJerome describes, with justifiable sarcasm, these moral weaklings,\r\ncharged with the solemn responsibility of preaching a pure gospel to a\r\ndying empire. \"Such men think of nothing but their dress; they use\r\nperfumes freely, and see that there are no creases in their leather\r\nshoes. Their curling hair shows traces of the tongs; their fingers\r\nglisten with rings; they walk on tiptoe across a damp road, not to\r\nsplash their feet. When you see men acting that way, think of them\r\nrather as bridegrooms than as clergymen. If he sees a pillow that takes\r\nhis fancy, or an elegant table-cover, or, indeed, any article of\r\nfurniture, he praises it, looks admiringly at it, takes it into his\r\nhand, and, complaining that he has nothing of the kind, begs or rather\r\nextorts it from its owner.\" Such trifling folly was fatal. The times\r\ndemanded men of vigorous spirit, who dared to face the general decline,\r\nand cry out in strong tones against it. The age needed moral warriors,\r\nwith the old Roman courage and love of sacrifice; martyrs willing to rot\r\nin prison or shed their blood in the street, not effeminate men, toying\r\nwith fancy table-covers and tiptoeing across a sprinkled road. \"And as a\r\nbackground,\" says Kingsley, \"to all this seething heap of corruption,\r\nmisrule and misery, hung the black cloud of the barbarians, the Teutonic\r\ntribes from whom we derive our best blood, ever coming nearer and\r\nnearer, waxing stronger and stronger, to be soon the conquerors of the\r\nCæsars and the masters of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were many pure and sincere Christians--a saving remnant. The\r\njoyous alacrity with which men and women responded to the monastic call,\r\nand entered upon careers of self-torture for the sake of deliverance\r\nfrom moral corruption, shows that the spirit of true faith was not\r\nextinct. These seekers after righteousness may be described as \"a dismal\r\nand fanatical set of men, overlooking the practical aims of life,\" but\r\nit is a fair question to ask, \"if they had not abandoned the world to\r\nits fate would they not have shared that fate?\" \"The glory of that age,\"\r\nsays Professor Dill, \"is the number of those who were capable of such\r\nself-surrender; and an age should be judged by its ideals, not by the\r\nmediocrity of conventional religion masking worldly self-indulgence.\r\nThis we have always with us; the other we have not always.\"\r\n\r\nYet the sad fact remains that the transforming power of Christianity was\r\npractically helpless before the surging floods of vice and superstition.\r\nThe noble struggles of a few saints were as straws in a hurricane. The\r\nchurch had all she could do to save herself.\r\n\r\n\"When Christianity itself was in such need of reform,\" says Lord, \"when\r\nChristians could scarcely be distinguished from pagans in love of\r\ndisplay, and in egotistical ends, how could it reform the world? When it\r\nwas a pageant, a ritualism, an arm of the state, a vain philosophy, a\r\nsuperstition, a formula, how could it save, if ever so dominant? The\r\ncorruptions of the church in the fourth century are as well\r\nauthenticated as the purity and moral elevation of Christians in the\r\nsecond century.\" Even in the early days of Christianity the ruin of Rome\r\nwas impending, but, at that time, the adherents of the Christian\r\nreligion were few and poor. They did not possess enough power and\r\ninfluence to save the state. When monasticism came to Rome, the lords of\r\nthe church were getting ready to sit upon the thrones of princes, but\r\nthe dazzling victory of the church was not a spiritual conquest of sin,\r\nso the last ray of hope for the Empire was extinguished. Her fall was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nWith this outlined picture in mind, fancy Athanasius and his monks at\r\nRome. These men despise luxury and contemn riches. They have come to\r\nmake Rome ring with the old war cries,--although they wrestled not\r\nagainst flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness in high\r\nplaces. Terror and despair are on every side, but they are not afraid.\r\nThey know what it means to face the demons of the desert, to lie down at\r\nnight with wild beasts for companions. They have not yielded to the\r\ndepravity of the human heart and the temptations of a licentious age.\r\nThey have conquered sinful appetites by self-abnegation and fasting.\r\nThey come to a distracted society with a message of peace--a peace won\r\nby courageous self-sacrifice. They call men to save their perishing\r\nsouls by surrendering their wills to God and enlisting in a campaign\r\nagainst the powers of darkness. They appeal to the ancient spirit of\r\ncourage and love of hardship. They arouse the dormant moral energies of\r\nthe profligate nobles, proud of the past and sick of the present. The\r\nstory of Anthony admonished Rome that a life of sensuous gratification\r\nwas inglorious, unworthy of the true Roman, and that the flesh could be\r\nmastered by heroic endeavor.\r\n\r\nWomen, who spent their hours in frivolous amusements, welcomed with\r\ngratitude the discovery that they could be happy without degradation,\r\nand joyfully responded to the call of righteousness. \"Despising\r\nthemselves,\" says Kingsley, \"despising their husbands to whom they had\r\nbeen wedded in loveless wedlock, they too fled from a world which had\r\nsated and sickened them.\"\r\n\r\nWoman's natural craving for lofty friendships and pure aspirations found\r\nsatisfaction in the monastic ideal. She fled from the incessant broils\r\nof a corrupt court, from the courtesans that usurped the place of the\r\nwife, from the insolence and selfishness of men who scorned even the\r\nappearance of virtue and did not hesitate to degrade even their wives\r\nand sisters. She would disprove the biting sarcasm of Juvenal,--\r\n\r\n     \"Women, in judgment weak, in feeling strong,\r\n     By every gust of passion borne along.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A woman stops at nothing, when she wears\r\n     Rich emeralds round her neck, and in her ears\r\n     Pearls of enormous size; these justify\r\n     Her faults, and make all lawful in her eye.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore did the women hear with tremulous eagerness the story of the\r\nsaintly inhabitants of the desert, and flinging away their trinkets,\r\nthey hastened to the solitude of the cell, there to mourn their folly\r\nand seek pardon and peace at the feet of the Most High.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the men, born to nobler tasks than fawning upon princes and\r\nsquandering life and fortune in gluttony and debauchery, blushed for\r\nshame, and abandoned forever the company of sensualists and parasites.\r\nPotitianus, a young officer of rank, read the life of Anthony, and cried\r\nto his fellow-soldier: \"Tell me, I pray thee, whither all our labors\r\ntend? What do we seek? For whom do we carry arms? What can be our\r\ngreatest hope in the palace but to be friend to the Emperor? And how\r\nfrail is that fortune! What perils! When shall this be?\" Inspired by the\r\nmonastic story he exchanged the friendship of the Emperor for the\r\nfriendship of God, and the military life lost all its attractiveness.\r\n\r\nA philosopher and teacher hears the same narrative, and his countenance\r\nbecomes grave; he seizes the arm of Alypius, his friend, and earnestly\r\nasks: \"What, then, are we doing? How is this? What hast thou been\r\nhearing? These ignorant men rise; they take Heaven by force, and we,\r\nwith our heartless sciences, behold us wallowing in the flesh and in\r\nour blood! Is it shameful to follow them, and are we not rather\r\ndisgraced by not following them?\" So, disgusted with his self-seeking\r\ncareer, his round of empty pleasures, he, too, is moved by this higher\r\ncall to abandon his wickedness and devote his genius to the cause of\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\nAmbrose, Paulinus, Chrysostom, Basil, Gregory, and many others, holding\r\nimportant official posts or candidates for the highest honors, abandoned\r\nall their chances of political preferment in order to preach the gospel\r\nof ascetic Christianity.\r\n\r\nYes, for good or evil, Rome is profoundly stirred. The pale monk, in all\r\nhis filth and poverty, is the master of the best hearts in the capital.\r\nEvery one in whom aspiration is still alive, who longs for some new\r\nlight, and all who vaguely grope after a higher life, hear his voice and\r\nbecome pliant to his will.\r\n\r\n\"Great historic movements,\" says Grimke, \"are born not in whirlwinds, in\r\nearthquakes, and pomps of human splendor and power, but in the agonies\r\nand enthusiasms of grand, heroic spirits.\" Monastic history, like\r\nsecular, centers in the biographies of such great men as Anthony, Basil,\r\nJerome, Benedict, Francis, Dominic and Loyola. To understand the\r\ncharacter of the powerful forces set in motion by the coming of the\r\nmonks to Rome, it is necessary to know the leading spirits whose\r\npreeminent abilities and lofty personalities made Western monasticism\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\nThe time is about 418 A.D.; the place, a monastery in Bethlehem, near\r\nthe cave of the Nativity. In a lonely cell, within these monastic walls,\r\nwe shall find the man we seek. He is so old and feeble that he has to be\r\nraised in his bed by means of a cord affixed to the ceiling. He spends\r\nhis time chiefly in reciting prayers. His voice, once clear and\r\nresonant, sinks now to a whisper. His failing vision no longer follows\r\nthe classic pages of Virgil or dwells fondly on the Hebrew of the Old\r\nTestament. This is Saint Jerome, the champion of asceticism, the\r\nbiographer of hermits, the lion of Christian polemics, the translator of\r\nthe Bible, and the worthy, brilliant, determined foe of a dissolute\r\nsociety and a worldly church. Although he spent thirty-four years of his\r\nlife in Palestine, I shall consider Jerome in connection with the\r\nmonasticism of the West, for it was in Rome that he exercised his\r\ngreatest influence. His translation of the Scriptures is the Vulgate of\r\nthe Roman church, and his name is enrolled in the calendar of her\r\nsaints. \"He is,\" observes Schaff \"the connecting link between the\r\nEastern and Western learning and religion.\"\r\n\r\nBy charming speech and eloquent tongue Jerome won over the men, but\r\nprincipally the women, of Rome to the monastic life. So powerful was his\r\nmessage when addressed to the feminine heart, that mothers are said to\r\nhave locked their daughters in their rooms lest they should fall under\r\nthe influence of his magnetic voice. It was largely owing to his own\r\nlabors that he could write in after years: \"Formerly, according to the\r\ntestimony of the apostles, there were few rich, few noble, few powerful\r\namong the Christians. Now, it is no longer so. Not only among the\r\nChristians, but among the monks are to be found a multitude of the wise,\r\nthe noble and the rich.\"\r\n\r\nNear to the very year that Athanasius came to Rome, or about 340 A.D.,\r\nJerome was born at Stridon, in Dalmatia, in what is now called the\r\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy. His parents were modestly wealthy and were\r\nslaveholders. His student days were spent in Rome, where he divided his\r\ntime between the study of books and the revels of the streets. One day\r\nsome young Christians induced him to visit the catacombs with them.\r\nHere, before the graves of Christian martyrs, a quiet and holy influence\r\nstole into his heart, that finally led to his conversion and baptism.\r\nEmbracing the monastic ideal, he gathered around him a few congenial\r\nfriends, who joined him in a covenant of rigid abstinence and ascetic\r\ndiscipline. Then followed a year of travel with these companions,\r\nthrough Asia Minor, ending disastrously at Antioch. One of his friends\r\nreturned home, two of them died, and he himself became so sick with\r\nfever that his life was despaired of. Undismayed by these evils, brought\r\non by excessive austerities, he determined to retire to a life\r\nof solitude.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty miles southeast from Antioch was a barren waste of nature\r\nbut a paradise for monks--the Desert of Chalcis. On its western border\r\nwere several monasteries. All about for miles, the dreary solitudes were\r\npeopled with shaggy hermits. They saw visions and dreamed dreams in\r\ncaves infested by serpents and wild beasts. They lay upon the sands,\r\nscorched in summer by the blazing sun, and chilled in winter by the\r\nwinds that blew from snowcapped mountains. For five years, Jerome dwelt\r\namong these demon-fighting recluses. Clad in sackcloth stained by\r\npenitential tears, he toiled for his daily bread, and struggled against\r\nvisions of Roman dancing girls. He was a most industrious reader of\r\nbooks and a great lover of debate. Monks from far and near visited him,\r\nand together they discussed questions of theology and philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut we may not follow this varied and eventful life in all its details.\r\nAfter a year or two spent at Constantinople, and three years at Rome, he\r\nreturned to the East, visiting the hermits of Egypt on his way, and\r\nfinally settled at Bethlehem. His fame soon drew around him a great\r\ncompany of monks. These he organized into monasteries. He built a\r\nhospital, and established an inn for travelers. Lacking the necessary\r\nfunds to carry out his projects, he dispatched his brother to the West\r\nwith instructions to sell what was left of his property, and the\r\nproceeds of this sale he devoted to the cause. While in Bethlehem he\r\nwrote defences of orthodoxy, eulogies of the dead, lives of saints and\r\ncommentaries on the Bible. He also completed his translation of the\r\nScriptures, and wrote numerous letters to persons dwelling in various\r\nparts of the empire.\r\n\r\nJerome rendered great service to monasticism by his literary labors. He\r\ninvested the dullest of lives with a halo of glory; under the magic\r\ntouch of his rhetoric the wilderness became a gladsome place and the\r\ndesert blossomed as the rose. His glowing language transfigured the pale\r\nface and sunken eyes of the starved hermit into features positively\r\nbeautiful, while the rags that hung loosely upon his emaciated frame\r\nbecame garments of lustrous white. \"Oh, that I could behold the desert,\"\r\nhe cries, \"lovelier than any city! Oh, that I could see those lonely\r\nspots made into a paradise by the saints that throng them!\" Without\r\ndetracting from the bitterness of the prospect, he glorifies the courage\r\nthat can face the horrors of the desert, and the heart that can rejoice\r\nmidst the solitude of the seas. Hear him describe the home of Bonosus, a\r\nhermit on an isle in the Adriatic:\r\n\r\n\"Bonosus, your friend, is now climbing the ladder foreshown in Jacob's\r\ndream. He is bearing his cross, neither taking thought for the morrow,\r\nnor looking back at what he has left. Here you have a youth, educated\r\nwith us in the refining accomplishments of the world, with abundance of\r\nwealth and in rank inferior to none of his associates; yet he forsakes\r\nhis mother, his sister, and his dearly loved brother, and settles like a\r\nnew tiller of Eden on a dangerous island, with the sea roaring round its\r\nreefs, while its rough crags, bare rocks and desolate aspect make it\r\nmore terrible still.... He sees the glory of God which even the apostles\r\nsaw not, save in the desert. He beholds, it is true, no embattled towns,\r\nbut he has enrolled his name in the new city. Garments of sackcloth\r\ndisfigure his limbs, yet so he will the sooner be caught up to meet\r\nChrist in the clouds. Round the entire island roars the frenzied sea,\r\nwhile the beetling crags along its winding shores resound as the billows\r\nbeat against them. Precipitous cliffs surround his dreadful abode as if\r\nit were a prison. He is careless, fearless, armed from head to foot in\r\nthe apostles' armor.\"\r\n\r\nListen to these trumpet tones as Jerome calls to a companion of his\r\nyouth in Rome: \"O desert, enamelled with the flowers of Christ! O\r\nretreat, which rejoicest in the friendship of God! What dost thou in the\r\nworld, my brother, with thy soul greater than the world? How long wilt\r\nthou remain in the shadow of roofs, and in the smoky dungeons of cities?\r\nBelieve me, I see here more light.\"\r\n\r\nTo pass hastily over such appeals, coming from distant lands across the\r\nsea to stir the minds of the thoughtful in Rome, is to ignore one of the\r\ncauses which produced the great exodus that followed. He made men see\r\nthat they were living in a moral Sodom, and that if they would save\r\ntheir souls they must escape to the desert. The power of personal\r\ninfluence, of inspiring private letters, can hardly be overemphasized in\r\nstudying the remarkable progress of asceticism. Great awakenings in the\r\nmoral, as in the political or the social world, may be traced to the\r\nprofound influence of individuals, whose prophetic insight and moral\r\nenthusiasm unfold the germ of the larger movements. There may be\r\nwidespread unrest, the ground may be prepared for the seed, but the\r\nimmediate cause of universal uprisings is the clarion call of genius.\r\nThus Luther's was the voice that cried in the wilderness, inciting a\r\nvast host for whom centuries had been preparing.\r\n\r\nBut Jerome's fame as a man of learning, possessing a critical taste and\r\na classic style of rare beauty and simplicity, must not blind us to the\r\ncrowning glory of his brilliant career. He was above all a spiritual\r\nforce. His chief appeal was to the conscience. He warmed the most torpid\r\nhearts by the fervor of his love, and encouraged the most hopeless by\r\nhis fiery zeal and heroic faith. As a promoter of monasticism, he\r\nclashed with the interests of an enfeebled clergy and a corrupt laity.\r\nNothing could swerve him from his course. False monks might draw\r\nterrible rebukes from him, but the conviction that the soul could be\r\ndelivered from captivity to the body only by mortification remained\r\nunshaken. He induced men to break the fetters of society that they\r\nmight, under the more favorable circumstances of solitude, wage war\r\nagainst their unruly passions.\r\n\r\nWhen parents objected to his monastic views, Jerome quoted the saying of\r\nJesus respecting the renunciation of father and mother, and then said:\r\n\"Though thy mother with flowing hair and rent garments, should show thee\r\nthe breasts which have nourished thee; though thy father should lie upon\r\nthe threshold; yet depart thou, treading over thy father, and fly with\r\ndry eyes to the standard of the cross. The love of God and the fear of\r\nhell easily rend the bonds of the household asunder. The Holy Scripture\r\nindeed enjoins obedience, but he who loves them more than Christ loses\r\nhis soul.\"\r\n\r\nJerome vividly portrays his own spiritual conflicts. The deserts were\r\ncrowded with saintly soldiers battling against similar temptations, the\r\nnature of which is suggested by the following excerpt from Jerome's\r\nwritings: \"How often,\" he says, \"when I was living in the desert, in the\r\nvast solitude which gives to hermits a savage dwelling-place, parched by\r\na burning sun, how often did I fancy myself among the pleasures of Rome!\r\nI used to sit alone because I was filled with bitterness. Sack-cloth\r\ndisfigured my unshapely limbs and my skin from long neglect had become\r\nblack as an Ethiopian's. Tears and groans were every day my portion; and\r\nif drowsiness chanced to overcome my struggles against it, my bare\r\nbones, which hardly held together, clashed against the ground. Now\r\nalthough in my fear of hell I had consigned myself to this prison where\r\nI had no companions but scorpions and wild beasts, I often found myself\r\namid bevies of girls. Helpless, I cast myself at the feet of Jesus, I\r\nwatered them with my tears, and I subdued my rebellious body with weeks\r\nof abstinence. I remember how I often cried aloud all night till the\r\nbreak of day. I used to dread my cell as if it knew my thoughts, and\r\nstern and angry with myself, I used to make my way alone into the\r\ndesert. Wherever I saw hollow valleys, craggy mountains, steep cliffs,\r\nthere I made my oratory; there the house of correction for my unhappy\r\nflesh. There, also, when I had shed copious tears and had strained my\r\neyes to heaven, I sometimes felt myself among angelic hosts and sang for\r\njoy and gladness.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt these men were warring against nature. Their yielding to the\r\ntemptation to obtain spiritual dominance by self-flagellation and\r\nfasting may be criticized in the light of modern Christianity.\r\n\"Fanaticism defies nature,\" says F.W. Robertson, \"Christianity refines\r\nit and respects it. Christianity does not denaturalize, but only\r\nsanctifies and refines according to the laws of nature. Christianity\r\ndoes not destroy our natural instincts, but gives them a higher and\r\nnobler direction.\" To all this I must assent, but, at the same time, I\r\ncannot but reverence that pure passion for holiness which led men,\r\ndespairing of acquiring virtue in a degenerate age, to flee from the\r\nworld and undergo such torments to attain their soul's ideal. The form,\r\nthe method of their conflict was transient, the spirit and purpose\r\neternal. All honor to them for their magnificent and terrible struggle,\r\nwhich has forever exalted the spiritual ideal, and commanded men\r\neverywhere to seek first \"the Kingdom of God and its righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nJerome was always fond of the classics, although pagan writers were not\r\nin favor with the early Christians. One night he dreamed he was called\r\nto the skies where he was soundly flogged for reading certain pagan\r\nauthors. This vision interrupted his classical studies for a time. In\r\nlater years he resumed his beloved Virgil; and he vigorously defended\r\nhimself against those who charged him with being a Pagan and an\r\napostate on account of his love for Greek and Roman literature. If his\r\nadmiration for Virgil was the Devil's work, I but give the Devil his due\r\nwhen I declare that much of the charm of Jerome's literary productions\r\nis owing to the inspiration of classic models.\r\n\r\nOur attention must now be transferred from Jerome to the high-born Roman\r\nmatrons, who laid off their silks that they might clothe themselves in\r\nthe humble garb of the nun. As the narrative proceeds I shall let Jerome\r\nspeak as often as possible, that the reader may become acquainted with\r\nthe style of those biographies and eulogies which were the talk of Rome,\r\nand which have been admired so highly by succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nThose who embraced monasticism in Rome did so in one of two ways. Some\r\nsold their possessions, adopted coarse garments, and subsisted on the\r\nplainest food, but they did not leave the city and were still to be seen\r\nupon the streets. Jerome writes to Pammachius: \"Who would have believed\r\nthat a last descendant of the consuls, an ornament of the race of\r\nCamillus, could make up his mind to traverse the city in the black robe\r\nof a monk, and should not blush to appear thus clad in the midst of\r\nsenators.\" Some of those who remained at Rome established a sort of\r\nretreat for their ascetic friends.\r\n\r\nBut another class left Rome altogether. Some took up their abode on the\r\nrugged isles of the Adriatic or the Mediterranean. Large numbers of them\r\nwent to the East, principally to Palestine. Jerome was practically the\r\nabbot of a Roman colony of monks and nuns. Two motives, beside the\r\ngeneral ruling desire to achieve holiness, produced this exodus to the\r\nHoly Land, which culminated centuries later in the crusades. One was a\r\ndesire to see the deserts and caves, the abode of hermits famous for\r\npiety and miracles. Jerome, as I have shown, invested these lonely\r\nretreats and strange characters with a sort of holy romance, and hence,\r\nfaith, mingled with curiosity, led men to the East. Another motive was\r\nthe desire to visit the land of the Saviour, to tread the soil\r\nconsecrated by his labors of love, to live a life of poverty in the land\r\nwhere He had no home He could call his own.\r\n\r\nSt. Paula was one of the women who left Rome and went to Palestine. The\r\nstory of her life is told in a letter designed to comfort her daughter\r\nEustochium at the time of Paula's death. The epistle begins: \"If all the\r\nmembers of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my\r\nlimbs were to be gifted with a human voice, I could still do no justice\r\nto the virtues of the holy and venerable Paula. Of the stock of the\r\nGracchi, descended from the Scipios, she yet preferred Bethlehem to\r\nRome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin.\"\r\nHer husband was of royal blood and had died leaving her five children.\r\nAt his death, she gave herself to works of charity. The poor and sick\r\nshe wrapped in her own blankets. She began to tire of the receptions and\r\nother social duties which her position entailed upon her. While in this\r\nframe of mind, two Eastern bishops were entertained at her home during a\r\ngathering of ecclesiastics. They seem to have imparted the monastic\r\nimpulse, perhaps by the rehearsal of monastic tales, for we are informed\r\nthat at this time she determined to leave servants, property and\r\nchildren, in order to embrace the monastic life.\r\n\r\nLet us stand with her children and kinsfolk on the shore of the sea as\r\nthey take their final farewell of Paula. \"The sails were set and the\r\nstrokes of the rowers carried the vessel into the deep. On the shore\r\nlittle Toxotius stretched forth his hands in entreaty, while Rufina, now\r\ngrown up, with silent sobs besought her mother to wait until she should\r\nbe married. But still Paula's eyes were dry as she turned them\r\nheavenwards, and she overcame her love for her children by her love for\r\nGod. She knew herself no more as a mother that she might approve herself\r\na handmaid of Christ. Yet her heart was rent within her, and she\r\nwrestled with her grief as though she were being forcibly separated from\r\nparts of herself. The greatness of the affection she had to overcome\r\nmade all admire her victory the more. Though it is against the laws of\r\nnature, she endured this trial with unabated faith.\"\r\n\r\nSo the vessel ploughed onward, carrying the mother who thought she was\r\nhonoring God and attaining the true end of being through ruthless\r\nstrangling of maternal love. She visited Syria and Egypt and the islands\r\nof Ponta and Cyprus. At the feet of the hermit fathers she begged their\r\nblessing and tried to emulate the virtues she believed they possessed.\r\nAt Jerusalem she fell upon her face and kissed the stone before the\r\nsepulcher. \"What tears, she shed, what groans she uttered, what grief\r\nshe poured out all Jerusalem knows!\"\r\n\r\nShe established two monasteries at Bethlehem, one of which was for\r\nwomen. Here, with her daughter, she lived a life of rigid abstinence.\r\nHer nuns had nothing they could call their own. If they paid too much\r\nattention to dress Paula said, \"A clean body and a clean dress mean an\r\nunclean soul.\" To her credit, she was more lenient with others than with\r\nherself. Jerome admits she went to excess, and prudently observes:\r\n\"Difficult as it is to avoid extremes, the philosophers are quite right\r\nin their opinion that virtue is a mean and vice an excess, or, as we may\r\nexpress it in one short sentence, in nothing too much.\" Paula swept\r\nfloors and toiled in the kitchen. She slept on the ground, covered by a\r\nmat of goat's hair. Her weeping was incessant. As she meditated over the\r\nScriptures, her tears fell so profusely that her sight was endangered.\r\nJerome warned her to spare her eyes, but she said: \"I must disfigure\r\nthat face which, contrary to God's commandment, I have painted with\r\nrouge, white lead and antimony.\" If this be a sin against the Almighty,\r\nbear witness, O ye daughters of Eve! Her love for the poor continued to\r\nbe the motive of her great liberality. In fact, her giving knew no\r\nbounds. Fuller wisely remarks that \"liberality must have banks as well\r\nas a stream;\" but Paula said: \"My prayer is that I may die a beggar,\r\nleaving not a penny to my daughter and indebted to strangers for my\r\nwinding sheet.\" Her petition was literally granted, for she died leaving\r\nher daughter not only without a penny but overwhelmed in a mass\r\nof debts.\r\n\r\nAs Jerome approaches the description of Paula's death, he says:\r\n\"Hitherto the wind has all been in my favor and my keel has smoothly\r\nploughed through the heaving sea. But now my bark is running upon the\r\nrocks, the billows are mountain high, and imminent shipwreck awaits me.\"\r\nYet Paula, like David, must go the way of all the earth. Surrounded by\r\nher followers chanting psalms, she breathed her last. An immense\r\nconcourse of people attended her funeral. Not a single monk lingered in\r\nhis cell. Thus, the twenty hard years of self-torture for this Roman\r\nlady of culture ended in the rest of the grave.\r\n\r\nUpon her tombstone was placed this significant inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"Within this tomb a child of Scipio lies,\r\n     A daughter of the far-famed Pauline house,\r\n     A scion of the Gracchi, of the stock\r\n     Of Agamemnon's self, illustrious:\r\n     Here rests the lady Paula, well beloved\r\n     Of both her parents, with Eustochium\r\n     For daughter; she the first of Roman dames\r\n     Who hardship chose and Bethlehem for Christ.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting character of that period was Marcella, a beautiful\r\nwoman of illustrious lineage, a descendant of consuls and prefects.\r\nAfter a married life of seven years her husband died. She determined not\r\nto embark on the matrimonial seas a second time, but to devote herself\r\nto works of charity. Cerealis, an old man, but of consular rank, offered\r\nher his fortune that he might consider her less his wife than his\r\ndaughter. \"Had I a wish to marry,\" was her noble reply, \"I should look\r\nfor a husband and not for an inheritance.\" Disdaining all enticements to\r\nremain in society, she began her monastic career with joy and turned\r\nher home into a retreat for women who, like herself, wished to retire\r\nfrom the world. It is not known just what rules governed their\r\nrelations, but they employed the time in moderate fasting, prayers and\r\nalms-giving.\r\n\r\nMarcella lavished her wealth upon the poor. Jerome praises her\r\nphilanthropic labors thus: \"Our widow's clothing was meant to keep out\r\nthe cold and not to show her figure. She stored her money in the\r\nstomachs of the poor rather than to keep it at her own disposal.\" Seldom\r\nseen upon the streets, she remained at home, surrounded by virgins and\r\nwidows, obedient and loving to her mother. Among the high-born women it\r\nwas regarded as degrading to assume the costume of the nun, but she bore\r\nthe scorn of her social equals with humility and grace.\r\n\r\nThis quiet and useful life was rudely and abruptly ended by a dreadful\r\ncatastrophe. Alaric the Goth had seized and sacked Rome. The world stood\r\naghast. The sad news reached Jerome in his cell at Bethlehem, who\r\nexpressed his sorrow in forceful language: \"My voice sticks in my\r\nthroat; and as I dictate, sobs choke my utterance. The city which has\r\ntaken the whole world is itself taken.\" Rude barbarians invaded the\r\nsanctity of Marcella's retreat. They demanded her gold, but she pointed\r\nto the coarse dress she wore to show them she had no buried treasures.\r\nThey did not believe her, and cruelly beat her with cudgels. A few days\r\nafter the saintly heroine of righteousness went to her long home to\r\nenjoy richly-merited rest and peace.\r\n\r\n     \"Who can describe the carnage of that night?\r\n     What tears are equal to its agony?\r\n     Of ancient date a sovran city falls;\r\n     And lifeless in its streets and houses lie\r\n     Unnumbered bodies of its citizens.\r\n     In many a ghastly shape doth death appear.\"\r\n\r\nMarcella and her monastic home fell in the general ruin, but in the\r\nwords of Horace, she left \"a monument more enduring than brass.\" Her\r\nnoble life, so full of kind words and loving deeds, still stirs the\r\nhearts of her sisters who, while they may reject her ascetic ideal,\r\nwill, nevertheless, try to emulate her noble spirit. As Jerome said of\r\nPaula: \"By shunning glory she earned glory; for glory follows virtue as\r\nits shadow; and deserting those who seek it, it seeks those who\r\ndespise it.\"\r\n\r\nStill another woman claims our attention,--Fabiola, the founder of the\r\nfirst hospital. Lecky declares that \"the first public hospital and the\r\ncharity planted by that woman's hand overspread the world, and will\r\nalleviate to the end of time the darkest anguish of humanity.\" She, too,\r\nwas a widow who refused to marry again, but broke up her home, sold her\r\npossessions, and with the proceeds founded a hospital into which were\r\ngathered the sick from the streets. She nursed the sufferers and washed\r\ntheir ulcers and wounds. No task was beneath her, no sacrifice of\r\npersonal comfort too great for her love. Many helped her with their\r\ngold, but she gave herself. She also aided in establishing a home for\r\nstrangers at Portus, which became one of the most famous inns of the\r\ntime. Travelers from all parts of the world found a welcome and a\r\nshelter on landing at this port. When she died the roofs of Rome were\r\ncrowded with those who watched the funeral procession. Psalms were\r\nchanted, and the gilded ceilings of the churches resounded to the music\r\nin commendation of her loving life and labors.\r\n\r\nThese and other characters of like zeal and fortitude exemplify the\r\nspirit of the men and women who interested the West in monasticism. Much\r\nas their errors and extravagances may be deplored, there is no question\r\nthat some of them were types of the loftiest Christian virtues, inspired\r\nby the most laudable motives.\r\n\r\nNoble and true are Kingsley's words: \"We may blame those ladies, if we\r\nwill, for neglecting their duties. We may sneer, if we will, at their\r\nweaknesses, the aristocratic pride, the spiritual vanity, we fancy we\r\ndiscover. We must confess that in these women the spirit of the old\r\nRoman matrons, which seemed to have been dead so long, flashed up for\r\none splendid moment ere it sank into the darkness of the middle ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monasticism and Women_\r\n\r\nThe origin of nunneries was coeval with that of monasteries, and the\r\nhistory of female recluses runs parallel to that of the men. Almost\r\nevery male order had its counterpart in some sort of a sisterhood. The\r\ngeneral moral character of these female associations was higher than\r\nthat of the male organizations. I have confined my treatment in this\r\nwork to the monks, but a few words may be said at this point concerning\r\nfemale ascetics.\r\n\r\nHermit life was unsuited to women, but we know that at a very early date\r\nmany of them retired to the seclusion of convent life. It will be\r\nrecalled that in the biography of St. Anthony, before going into the\r\ndesert he placed his sister in the care of some virgins who were living\r\na life of abstinence, apart from society. It is very doubtful if any\r\nuniform rule governed these first religious houses, or if definitely\r\norganized societies appear much before the time of Benedict. The\r\nvariations in the monastic order among the men were accompanied by\r\nsimilar changes in the associations of women.\r\n\r\nThe history of these sisterhoods discloses three interesting and\r\nnoteworthy facts that merit brief mention:\r\n\r\nFirst, the effect of a corrupt society upon women. As in the case of\r\nmen, women were moved to forsake their social duties because they were\r\nweary of the sensual and aimless life of Rome. Those were the days of\r\nelaborate toilettes, painted faces and blackened eyelids, of intrigues\r\nand foolish babbling. Venial faults--it may be thought--innocent\r\ndisplays of tender frailty; but woman's nature demands loftier\r\nemployments. A great soul craves occupations and recognizes obligations\r\nmore in harmony with the true nobility of human nature. Rome had no\r\nmonitor of the higher life until the monks came with their stories of\r\nheroic self-abnegation and unselfish toil. The women felt the force and\r\ntruth of Jerome's criticism of their trifling follies when he said: \"Do\r\nnot seek to appear over-eloquent, nor trifle with verse, nor make\r\nyourself gay with lyric songs. And do not, out of affectation, follow\r\nthe sickly taste of married ladies, who now pressing their teeth\r\ntogether, now keeping their lips wide apart, speak with a lisp, and\r\npurposely clip their words, because they fancy that to pronounce them\r\nnaturally is a mark of country breeding.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Dill is inclined to discount the testimony of Jerome\r\nrespecting the morals of Roman society. He thinks Jerome exaggerated the\r\nperils surrounding women. He says: \"The truth is Jerome is not only a\r\nmonk but an artist in words; and his horror of evil, his vivid\r\nimagination, and his passion for literary effect, occasionally carry him\r\nbeyond the region of sober fact. There was much to amend in the morals\r\nof the Roman world. But we must not take the leader of a great moral\r\nreformation as a cool and dispassionate observer.\" But this observation\r\namounts to nothing more than a cautionary word against mistaking evils\r\ncommon to all times for special symptoms of excessive immorality.\r\nProfessor Dill practically concedes the truthfulness of contemporary\r\nwitnesses, including Jerome, when he says: \"Yet, after all allowances,\r\nthe picture is not a pleasant one. We feel that we are far away from the\r\nsimple, unworldly devotion of the freedmen and obscure toilers whose\r\nexistence was hardly known to the great world before the age of the\r\nAntonines, and who lived in the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount and in\r\nconstant expectation of the coming of their Lord. The triumphant Church,\r\nwhich has brought Paganism to its knees, is very different from the\r\nChurch of the catacombs and the persecutions.\" The picture which Jerome\r\ndraws of the Roman women is indeed repulsive, and Professor Dill would\r\ngladly believe it to be exaggerated, but, nevertheless, he thinks that\r\n\"if the priesthood, with its enormous influence, was so corrupt, it is\r\nonly probable that it debased the sex which is always most under\r\nclerical influence.\"\r\n\r\nBut far graver charges cling to the memories of the Roman women. Crime\r\ndarkened every household. The Roman lady was cruel and impure. She\r\ndelighted in the blood of gladiators and in illicit love. Roman law at\r\nthis time permitted women to hold and to control large estates, and it\r\nbecame a fad for these patrician ladies to marry poor men, so that they\r\nmight have their husbands within their power. All sorts of alliances\r\ncould then be formed, and if their husbands remonstrated, they, holding\r\nthe purse strings, were able to say: \"If you don't like it you can\r\nleave.\" A profligate himself, the husband usually kept his counsel, and\r\nas a reward, dwelt in a palace. \"When the Roman matrons became the equal\r\nand voluntary companions of their lords,\" says Gibbon, \"a new\r\njurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other partnerships,\r\nmight be dissolved by the abdication of one of the associates.\" I have\r\nbut touched the fringe of a veil I will not lift; but it is easy to\r\nunderstand why those women who cherished noble sentiments welcomed the\r\nmonastic life as a pathway of escape from scenes and customs from which\r\ntheir better natures recoiled in horror.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the fine quality of mercy that distinguishes woman's character\r\ndeserves recognition. Even though she retired to a convent, she could\r\nnot become so forgetful of her fellow creatures as her male companions.\r\nFrom the very beginning we observe that she was more unselfish in her\r\nasceticism than they. It is true the monk forsook all, and to that\r\nextent was self-sacrificing, but in his desire for his own salvation, he\r\nwas prone to neglect every one else. The monk's ministrations were too\r\noften confined to those who came to him, but the nun went forth to heal\r\nthe diseased and to bind up the broken-hearted. As soon as she embraced\r\nthe monastic life we read of hospitals. The desire for salvation drove\r\nman into the desert; a Christ-like mercy and divine sympathy kept his\r\nsister by the couch of pain.\r\n\r\nLastly, a word remains to be said touching the question of marriage. At\r\nfirst, the nun sometimes entered the marriage state, and, of course,\r\nleft the convent; but, beginning with Basil, this practice was\r\ncondemned, and irrevocable vows were exacted. In 407, Innocent I. closed\r\neven the door of penitence and forgiveness to those who broke their vows\r\nand married.\r\n\r\nWidows and virgins alike assumed the veil. Marriage itself was not\r\ndespised, because the monastic life was only for those who sought a\r\nhigher type of piety than, it was supposed, could be attained amid the\r\nordinary conditions of life. But marriage, as well as other so-called\r\nsecular relations, was eschewed by those who wished to make their\r\nsalvation sure. Jerome says: \"I praise wedlock, I praise marriage, but\r\nit is because they give me virgins; I gather the rose from the thorns,\r\nthe gold from the earth, the pearl from the shell.\" He therefore\r\ntolerated marriage among people contented with ordinary religious\r\nattainments, but he thought it incompatible with true holiness.\r\nAugustine admitted that the mother and her daughter may be both in\r\nheaven, but one a bright and the other a dim star. Some writers, as\r\nHelvidius, opposed this view and maintained that there was no special\r\nvirtue in an unmarried life; that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also\r\nthe mother of other children, and as such was an example of Christian\r\nvirtue. Jerome brought out his guns and poured hot shot into the\r\nenemies' camp. In the course of his answer, which contained many\r\nintolerant and acrimonious statements, he drew a comparison between the\r\nmarried and the unmarried state. It is interesting because it reflects\r\nthe opinions of those who disparaged marriage, and reveals the character\r\nof the principles which the early Fathers advocated. It is very evident\r\nfrom this letter against Helvidius that Jerome regarded all secular\r\nduties as interfering with the pursuit of the highest virtue.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" he says, \"there is no difference between one who spends\r\nher time in prayer and fasting, and one who must, at her husband's\r\napproach, make up her countenance, walk with a mincing gait, and feign a\r\nshow of endearment? The virgin aims to appear less comely; she will\r\nwrong herself so as to hide her natural attractions. The married woman\r\nhas the paint laid on before her mirror, and, to the insult of her\r\nMaker, strives to acquire something more than her natural beauty. Then\r\ncome the prattling of infants, the noisy household, children watching\r\nfor her word and waiting for her kiss, the reckoning up of expenses, the\r\npreparation to meet the outlay. On one side you will see a company of\r\ncooks, girded for the onslaught and attacking the meat; there you may\r\nhear the hum of a multitude of weavers. Meanwhile a message is delivered\r\nthat her husband and his friends have arrived. The wife, like a swallow,\r\nflies all over the house. She has to see to everything. Is the sofa\r\nsmooth? Is the pavement swept? Are the flowers in the cup? Is dinner\r\nready? Tell me, pray, amid all this, is there room for the thought\r\nof God?\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Roman married life as it appeared to Jerome. The very duties\r\nand blessings that we consider the glory of the family he despised. I\r\nwill return to his views later, but it is interesting to note the\r\nabsence at this period, of the modern and true idea that God may be\r\nserved in the performance of household and other secular duties. Women\r\nfled from such occupations in those days that they might be religious.\r\nThe disagreeable fact of Peter's marriage was overcome by the assertion\r\nthat he must have washed away the stain of his married life by the blood\r\nof his martyrdom. Such extreme views arose partly as a reaction from and\r\na protest against the dominant corruption, a state of affairs in which\r\nhappy and holy marriages were rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spread of Monasticism in Europe_\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said of monastic life in Rome, were it not now\r\nnecessary to treat of the spread of monasticism in Europe. There are\r\nmany noble characters whom we ought to know, such as Ambrose, one of\r\nChristendom's greatest bishops, who led a life of poverty and strict\r\nabstinence, like his sister Marcella, whom we have met. He it was, of\r\nwhom the Emperor Theodosius said: \"I have met a man who has told me the\r\ntruth.\" Well might he so declare, for Ambrose refused him admission to\r\nthe church at Milan, because his hands were red with the blood of the\r\nmurdered, and succeeded in persuading him to submit to discipline. To\r\nAmbrose may be applied the words which Gibbon wrote of Gregory\r\nNazianzen: \"The title of Saint has been added to his name, but the\r\ntenderness of his heart and the elegance of his genius reflect a more\r\npleasing luster on his memory.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of John, surnamed Chrysostom, who was born at Antioch, in 347,\r\nis exceedingly interesting. He was a young lawyer, who entered the\r\npriesthood after his baptism. He at once set his heart on the monastic\r\nlife, but his mother took him to her chamber, and, by the bed where she\r\nhad given him birth, besought him in fear, not to forsake her. \"My son,\"\r\nshe said in substance, \"my only comfort in the midst of the miseries of\r\nthis earthly life is to see thee constantly, and to behold in thy traits\r\nthe faithful image of my beloved husband, who is no more. When you have\r\nburied me and joined my ashes with those of your father, nothing will\r\nthen prevent you from retiring into the monastic life. But so long as I\r\nbreathe, support me by your presence, and do not draw down upon you the\r\nwrath of God by bringing such evils upon me who have given you no\r\noffence.\" This singularly tender petition was granted, but Chrysostom\r\nturned his home into a monastery, slept on the bare floor, ate little\r\nand seldom, and prayed much by day and by night.\r\n\r\nAfter his mother's death Chrysostom enjoyed the seclusion of a monastic\r\nsolitude for six years, but impairing his health by excessive\r\nself-mortification he returned to Antioch in 380. He rapidly rose to a\r\nposition of commanding influence in the church. His peerless oratorical\r\nand literary gifts were employed in elevating the ascetic ideal and in\r\nunsparing denunciations of the worldly religion of the imperial court.\r\nHe incurred the furious hatred of the young and beautiful Empress\r\nEudoxia, who united her influence with that of the ambitious Theophilus,\r\npatriarch of Alexandria, and Chrysostom was banished from\r\nConstantinople, but died on his way to the remote desert of Pityus. His\r\npowerful sermons and valuable writings contributed in no small degree to\r\nthe spread of monasticism among the Christians of his time.\r\n\r\nThen there was Augustine, the greatest thinker since Plato. \"We shall\r\nmeet him,\" says Schaff, \"alike on the broad highways and the narrow\r\nfoot-paths, on the giddy Alpine heights and in the awful depths of\r\nspeculation, wherever philosophical thinkers before him or after him\r\nhave trod.\" He, too, like all the other leaders of thought in his time,\r\nwas ascetic in his habits. Although he lived and labored for\r\nthirty-eight years at Hippo, a Numidian city about two hundred miles\r\nwest of Carthage, in Africa, Augustine was regarded as the intellectual\r\nhead not only of North Africa but of Western Christianity. He gathered\r\nhis clergy into a college of priests, with a community of goods, thus\r\napproaching as closely to the regular monastic life as was possible to\r\nsecular clergymen. He established religious houses and wrote a set of\r\nrules, consisting of twenty-four articles, for the government of\r\nmonasteries. These rules were superseded by those of Benedict, but they\r\nwere resuscitated under Charlemagne and reappeared in the famous Austin\r\nCanons of the eleventh century. Little did Augustine think that a\r\nthousand years later an Augustinian monk--Luther--would abandon his\r\norder to become the founder of modern Protestantism.\r\n\r\nAugustine published a celebrated essay,--\"On the Labor of Monks,\"--in\r\nwhich he pointed out the dangers of monachism, condemned its abuses, and\r\nended by sighing for the quiet life of the monk who divided his day\r\nbetween labor, reading and prayer, whilst he himself spent his years\r\namid the noisy throng and the perplexities of his episcopate.\r\n\r\nThese men, and many others, did much to further monasticism. But we must\r\nnow leave sunny Africa and journey northward through Gaul into the land\r\nof the hardy Britons and Scots.\r\n\r\nAthanasius, the same weary exile whom we have encountered in Egypt and\r\nin Rome, had been banished by Constantine to Treves, in 336. In 346 and\r\n349 he again visited Gaul. He told the same story of Anthony and the\r\nEgyptian hermits with similar results.\r\n\r\nThe most renowned ecclesiastic of the Gallican church, whose name is\r\nmost intimately associated with the spread of monasticism in Western\r\nEurope, before the days of Benedict, was Saint Martin of Tours. He lived\r\nabout the years 316-396 A.D. The chronicle of his life is by no means\r\ntrustworthy, but that is essential neither to popularity nor saintship.\r\nOnly let a Severus describe his life and miracles in glowing rhetoric\r\nand fantastic legend and the people will believe it, pronouncing him\r\ngreatest among the great, the mightiest miracle-worker of that\r\nmiracle-working age.\r\n\r\nMartin was a soldier three years, against his will, under Constantine.\r\nOne bleak winter day he cut his white military coat in two with his\r\nsword and clothed a beggar with half of it. That night he heard Jesus\r\naddress the angels: \"Martin, as yet only a catechumen has clothed me\r\nwith his garment.\" After leaving the army he became a hermit, and,\r\nsubsequently, bishop of Tours. He lived for years just outside of Tours\r\nin a cell made of interlaced branches. His monks dwelt around him in\r\ncaves cut out of scarped rocks, overlooking a beautiful stream. They\r\nwere clad in camel's hair and lived on a diet of brown bread, sleeping\r\non a straw couch.\r\n\r\nBut Martin's monks did not take altogether kindly to their mode of life.\r\nSeverus records an amusing story of their rebellion against the meager\r\nallowance of food. The Egyptian could exist on a few figs a day. But\r\nthese rude Gauls, just emerging out of barbarism, were accustomed to\r\ndevour great slices of roasted meat and to drink deep draughts of beer.\r\nSuch sturdy children of the northern forests naturally disdained dainty\r\nmorsels of barley bread and small potations of wine. True, Athanasius\r\nhad said, \"Fasting is the food of angels,\" but these ascetic novices, in\r\ntheir perplexity, could only say: \"We are accused of gluttony; but we\r\nare Gauls; it is ridiculous and cruel to make us live like angels; we\r\nare not angels; once more, we are only Gauls.\" Their complaint comes\r\ndown to us as a pathetic but humorous protest of common sense against\r\nascetic fanaticism; or, regarded in another light, it may be considered\r\nas additional evidence of the depravity of the natural man.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all complaints, however, Martin did not abate the severity\r\nof his discipline. As a bishop he pushed his monastic system into all\r\nthe surrounding country. His zeal knew no bounds, and his strength\r\nseemed inexhaustible. \"No one ever saw him either gloomy or merry,\"\r\nremarks his biographer. Amid many embarrassments and difficulties he was\r\never the same, with a countenance full of heavenly serenity. He was a\r\ngreat miracle-worker--that is, if everything recorded of him is true. He\r\ncast out demons, and healed the sick; he had strange visions of angels\r\nand demons, and, wonderful to relate, thrice he raised bodies from\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nBut all conquerors are at last vanquished by the angel of death, and\r\nMartin passed into the company of the heavenly host and the category of\r\nsaints. Two thousand monks attended his funeral. His fame spread all\r\nover Europe. Tradition tells us he was the uncle of Saint Patrick of\r\nIreland. Churches were dedicated to him in France, Germany, Scotland and\r\nEngland. The festival of his birth is celebrated on the eleventh of\r\nNovember. In Scotland this day still marks the winter term, which is\r\ncalled Martinmas. Saint Martin's shrine was one of the most famous of\r\nthe middle ages, and was noted for its wonderful cures. No saint is\r\nheld, even now, in higher veneration by the French Catholic.\r\n\r\nIt is not known when the institution was planted in Spain, but in 380\r\nthe council of Saragossa forbade priests to assume monkish habits.\r\nGermany received the institution some time in the fifth century. The\r\nintroduction of Christianity as well as of monasticism into the British\r\nIsles is shrouded in darkness. A few jewels of fact may be gathered from\r\nthe legendary rubbish. It is probable that before the days of Benedict,\r\nSaint Patrick, independently of Rome, established monasteries in Ireland\r\nand preached the gospel there; and, without doubt, before the birth of\r\nBenedict of Nursia, there were monks and monasteries in Great Britain.\r\nThe monastery of Bangor is said to have been founded about 450 A.D.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Christianity was introduced into Britain before the\r\nclose of the second century, and that monasticism arose some time in the\r\nfifth century. Tertullian, about the beginning of the third century,\r\nboasts that Christianity had conquered places in Britain where the Roman\r\narms could not penetrate. Origen claimed that the power of the Savior\r\nwas manifest in Britain as well as in Muritania. The earliest notice we\r\nhave of a British church occurs in the writings of the Venerable Bede\r\n(673-735 A.D.), a monk whose numerous and valuable works on English\r\nhistory entitle him to the praise of being \"the greatest literary\r\nbenefactor this or any other nation has produced.\" He informs us that a\r\nBritish king--Lucius--embraced Christianity during the reign of the\r\nEmperor Aurelius, and that missionaries were sent from Rome to Britain\r\nabout that time. Lingard says the story is suspicious, since \"we know\r\nnot from what source Bede, at the distance of five centuries, derived\r\nhis information.\" It seems quite likely that there must have been some\r\nChristians among the Roman soldiers or civil officials who lived in\r\nBritain during the Roman occupation of the country. The whole problem\r\nhas been the theme of so much controversy, however, that a fuller\r\ndiscussion is reserved for the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disorders and Oppositions_\r\n\r\nBut was there no protest against the progress of these ascetic\r\nteachings? Did the monastic institution command the unanimous approval\r\nof the church from the outset? There were many and strong outcries\r\nagainst the monks, but they were quickly silenced by the counter-shouts\r\nof praise. Even when rebellion against the system seemed formidable, it\r\nwas popular nevertheless. The lifted hand was quickly struck down, and\r\nvoices of opposition suddenly hushed. Like a mighty flood the movement\r\nswept on,--kings, when so inclined, being powerless to stop it. As Paula\r\nwas carried fainting from the funeral procession of Blæsilla, her\r\ndaughter, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd: \"Is not this\r\nwhat we have often said? She weeps for her daughter, killed with\r\nfasting. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable monks\r\nout of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the Tiber? They\r\nhave misled this unhappy mother; that she is not a nun from choice is\r\nclear. No heathen mother ever wept for her children as she does for\r\nBlæsilla.\" And this is Paula, who, choked with grief, refused to weep\r\nwhen she sailed from her children for the far East!\r\n\r\nUnhappily, history is often too dignified to retail the conversations of\r\nthe dinner-table and the gossip of private life. But this narrative\r\nindicates that in many a Roman family the monk was feared, despised and\r\nhated. Sometimes everyday murmurs found their way into literature and so\r\npassed to posterity. Rutilius, the Pagan poet, as he sails before a\r\nhermit isle in the Mediterranean, exclaims: \"Behold, Capraria rises\r\nbefore us; that isle is full of wretches, enemies of light. I detest\r\nthese rocks scene of a recent shipwreck.\" He then goes on to declare\r\nthat a young and rich friend, impelled by the furies, had fled from men\r\nand gods to a living tomb, and was now decaying in that foul retreat.\r\nThis was no uncommon opinion. But contrast it with what Ambrose said of\r\nthose same isles: \"It is there in these isles, thrown down by God like a\r\ncollar of pearls upon the sea, that those who would escape from the\r\ncharms of dissipation find refuge. Nothing here disturbs their peace,\r\nall access is closed to the wild passions of the world. The mysterious\r\nsound of waves mingles with the chant of hymns; and, while the waters\r\nbreak upon the shores of these happy isles with a gentle murmur, the\r\npeaceful accents of the choir of the elect ascend toward Heaven from\r\ntheir bosom.\" No wonder the Milanese ladies guarded their daughters\r\nagainst this theological poet.\r\n\r\nEven among the Christians there were hostile as well as friendly critics\r\nof monasticism; Jovinian, whom Neander compares to Luther, is a type of\r\nthe former. Although a monk himself, he disputed the thesis that any\r\nmerit lay in celibacy, fasting or poverty. He opposed the worship of\r\nsaints and relics, and believed that one might retain possession of his\r\nproperty and make good use of it. He assailed the dissolute monks and\r\nclaimed that many of Rome's noblest young men and women were withdrawn\r\nfrom a life of usefulness into the desert. He held that there was really\r\nbut one class of Christians, namely, those who had faith in Christ, and\r\nthat a monk could be no more. But Jovinian was far in advance of his\r\nage, and it was many years before the truth of his view gained any\r\nconsiderable recognition. He was severely attacked by Jerome, who called\r\nhim a Christian Epicurean, and was condemned as a heretic by a synod at\r\nMilan, in 390. Thus the reformers were crushed for centuries. The Pagan\r\nEmperor, Julian, and the Christian, Valens, alike tried in vain to\r\nresist the emigration into the desert. Thousands fled, in times of peril\r\nto the state, from their civil and military duties, but the emperors\r\nwere powerless to prevent the exodus.\r\n\r\nThat there were grounds for complaint against the monks we may know from\r\nthe charges made even by those who favored the system. Jerome Ambrose,\r\nAugustine, and in fact almost every one of the Fathers tried to correct\r\nthe growing disorders. We learn from them that many fled from society,\r\nnot to become holy, but to escape slavery and famine; and that many were\r\nlazy and immoral. Their \"shaven heads lied to God.\" Avarice, ambition,\r\nor cowardice ruled hearts that should have been actuated by a love of\r\npoverty, self-sacrifice or courage. \"Quite recently,\" says Jerome, \"we\r\nhave seen to our sorrow a fortune worthy of Croesus brought to light by\r\na monk's death, and a city's alms collected for the poor, left by will\r\nto his sons and successors.\"\r\n\r\nMany monks traveled from place to place selling sham relics. Augustine\r\nwrote against \"those hypocrites who, in the dress of monks, wander about\r\nthe provinces carrying pretended relics, amulets, preservatives, and\r\nexpecting alms to feed their lucrative poverty and recompense their\r\npretended virtue.\" It is to the credit of the Fathers of the church\r\nthat they boldly and earnestly rebuked the vices of the monks and tried\r\nto purge the monastic system of its impurities.\r\n\r\nBut the church sanctioned the monastic movement. She could not have done\r\nanything else. \"It is one of the most striking occurrences in history,\"\r\nsays Harnack, \"that the church, exactly at the time when she was\r\ndeveloping more and more into a legal institution and a sacramental\r\nestablishment, outlined a Christian life-ideal which was incapable of\r\nrealization within her bounds, but only alongside of her. The more she\r\naffiliated herself with the world, the higher and more superhuman did\r\nshe make her ideal.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also noteworthy that this \"life-ideal\" seems to have led,\r\ninevitably, to fanaticism and other excesses, so that even at this early\r\ndate there was much occasion for alarm. Gross immorality was disclosed\r\nas well as luminous purity; indolence and laziness as well as the love\r\nof sacrifice and toil. So we shall find it down through the centuries.\r\n\"The East had few great men,\" says Milman, \"many madmen; the West,\r\nmadmen enough, but still very many, many great men.\" We have met some\r\nmadmen and some great men. We shall meet more of each type.\r\n\r\nAfter 450 A.D., monasticism suffered an eclipse for over half a century.\r\nIt seemed as if the Western institution was destined to end in that\r\nimbecility and failure which overtook the Eastern system. But there came\r\na man who infused new life into the monastic body. He systematized its\r\nscattered principles and concentrated the energies of the wandering and\r\nunorganized monks.\r\n\r\nOur next visit will be to the mountain home of this renowned character,\r\nfifty miles to the west of Rome. \"A single monk,\" says Montalembert, \"is\r\nabout to form there a center of spiritual virtue, and to light it up\r\nwith a splendor destined to shine over regenerated Europe for ten\r\ncenturies to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_THE BENEDICTINES_\r\n\r\nSaint Benedict, the founder of the famous monastic order that bears his\r\nname, was born at Nursia, about 480 A.D. His parents, who were wealthy,\r\nintended to give him a liberal education; but their plans were defeated,\r\nfor at fifteen years of age Benedict renounced his family and fortune,\r\nand fled from his school life in Rome. The vice of the city shocked and\r\ndisgusted him. He would rather be ignorant and holy, than educated and\r\nwicked. On his way into the mountains, he met a monk named Romanus,--the\r\nspot is marked by the chapel of Santa Crocella,--who gave him a\r\nhaircloth shirt and a monastic dress of skins. Continuing his journey\r\nwith Romanus, the youthful ascetic discovered a sunless cave in the\r\ndesert of Subiaco, about forty miles from Rome. Into this cell he\r\nclimbed, and in it he lived three years. It was so inaccessible that\r\nRomanus had to lower his food to him by a rope, to which was attached a\r\nbell to call him from his devotions. Once the Devil threw a stone at the\r\nrope and broke it.\r\n\r\nBut Benedict's bodily escape from the wickedness of Rome did not secure\r\nhis spiritual freedom. \"There was a certain lady of thin, airy shape,\r\nwho was very active in this solemnity; her name was Fancy.\" Time and\r\nagain, he revisited his old haunts, borne on the wings of his\r\nimagination. The face of a beautiful young girl of previous acquaintance\r\nconstantly appeared before him. He was about to yield to the temptation\r\nand to return, when, summoning all his strength, he made one mighty\r\neffort to dispel the illusion forever. Divesting himself of his clothes,\r\nhe rolled his naked body among the thorn-bushes near his cave. It was\r\ndrastic treatment, but it seems to have rid his mind effectually of\r\ndisturbing fancies. This singular self-punishment was used by Godric,\r\nthe Welsh saint, in the twelfth century. \"Failing to subdue his\r\nrebellious flesh by this method, he buried a cask in the earthen floor\r\nof his cell, filled it with water and fitted it with a cover, and in\r\nthis receptacle he shut himself up whenever he felt the titillations of\r\ndesire. In this manner, varied by occasionally passing the night up to\r\nhis chin in a river, of which he had broken the ice, he finally\r\nsucceeded in mastering his fiery nature.\"\r\n\r\nOne day some peasants discovered Benedict at the entrance of his cave.\r\nDeceived by his savage appearance, they mistook him for a wild beast,\r\nbut the supposed wolf proving to be a saint, they fell down and\r\nreverenced him.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the young ascetic attracted throngs of hermits, who took up\r\ntheir abodes near his cell. After a time monasteries were established,\r\nand Benedict was persuaded to become an abbot in one of them. His\r\nstrictness provoked much opposition among the monks, resulting in\r\ncarefully-laid plots to compass the moral ruin of their spiritual guide.\r\nAn attempt to poison him was defeated by a miraculous interposition, and\r\nBenedict escaped to a solitary retreat.\r\n\r\nAgain the moral hero became an abbot, and again the severity of his\r\ndiscipline was resented. This time a wicked and jealous priest sought to\r\nentrap the saint by turning into a garden in which he was accustomed to\r\nwalk seven young girls of exquisite physical charms. When Benedict\r\nencountered this temptation, he fled from the scene and retired to a\r\npicturesque mountain--the renowned Monte Cassino. Let Montalembert\r\ndescribe this celebrated spot among the western Apennines: \"At the foot\r\nof this rock Benedict found an amphitheatre of the time of the Cæsars,\r\namidst the ruins of the town of Casinum, which the most learned and\r\npious of Romans, Varro, that pagan Benedictine, whose memory and\r\nknowledge the sons of Benedict took pleasure in honoring, had rendered\r\nillustrious. From the summit the prospect extended on one side towards\r\nArpinum, where the prince of Roman orators was born, and on the other\r\ntowards Aquinum, already celebrated as the birthplace of Juvenal.... It\r\nwas amidst those noble recollections, this solemn nature, and upon that\r\npredestinated height, that the patriarch of the monks of the West\r\nfounded the capital of the monastic order.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 529 a great stronghold of Paganism in these wild regions\r\ngave way to Benedict's faith. Upon the ruins of a temple to Apollo, and\r\nin a grove sacred to Venus, arose the model of Western monasticism,--the\r\ncloister of Monte Cassino, which was to shine resplendent for a thousand\r\nyears. The limitations of my purpose will prevent me from following in\r\ndetail the fortunes of this renowned retreat, but it may not be out of\r\nplace to glance at its subsequent history.\r\n\r\nMonte Cassino is located three and a half miles to the northeast of the\r\ntown of Cassino, midway between Rome and Naples. About 589 A.D. the\r\nLombards destroyed the buildings, but the monks escaped to Rome, in\r\nfulfilment, so it is claimed, of a prophecy uttered by Benedict. It lay\r\nin ruins until restored by Gregory II. in 719, only to be burned in 884\r\nby the Saracens; seventy years later it was again rebuilt. It afterwards\r\npassed through a variety of calamities, and was consecrated, for the\r\nthird time, by Benedict XII., in 1729. Longfellow quotes a writer for\r\nthe _London Daily News_ as saying: \"There is scarcely a pope or emperor\r\nof importance who has not been personally connected with its history.\r\nFrom its mountain crag it has seen Goths, Lombards, Saracens, Normans,\r\nFrenchmen, Spaniards, Germans, scour and devastate the land which,\r\nthrough all modern history, has attracted every invader.\"\r\n\r\nIt was enriched by popes, emperors and princes. In its palmy days the\r\nabbot was the first baron in the realm, and commanded over four hundred\r\ntowns and villages. In 1866, it shared the fate of all the monasteries\r\nof Italy. It still stands upon the summit of the mountain, and can be\r\nseen by the traveler from the railway in the valley. At present it\r\nserves as a Catholic seminary with about two hundred students. It\r\ncontains a spacious church, richly ornamented with marble, mosaics and\r\npaintings. It has also a famous library which, in spite of bad usage, is\r\nstill immensely valuable. Boccaccio made a visit to the place, and when\r\nhe saw the precious books so vilely mutilated, he departed in tears,\r\nexclaiming: \"Now, therefore, O scholar, rack thy brains in the making of\r\nbooks!\" The library contains about twenty thousand volumes, and about\r\nthirty-five thousand popes' bulls, diplomas and charters. There are also\r\nabout a thousand manuscripts, some of which are of priceless value, as\r\nthey date from the sixth century downward, and consist of ancient\r\nBibles and important medieval literature.\r\n\r\nBenedict survived the founding of this monastery fourteen years. His\r\ntime was occupied in establishing other cloisters, perfecting his rule,\r\nand preaching. Many stories are related of his power over the hearts of\r\nthe untamed barbarians. Galea the Goth, out on a marauding expedition,\r\ndemanded a peasant to give him his treasures. The peasant, thinking to\r\nescape, said he had committed them to the keeping of Benedict. Galea\r\nimmediately ordered him to be bound on a horse and conducted to the\r\nsaint. Benedict was seated at the gateway reading when Galea and his\r\nprisoner arrived. Looking up from his book he fastened his eyes upon the\r\npoor peasant, who was immediately loosed from his bonds. The astonished\r\nGalea, awed by this miracle, fell at the feet of the abbot, and, instead\r\nof demanding gold, supplicated his blessing. Once a boy was drowning,\r\nand, at the command of Benedict, St. Maur, a wealthy young Roman, who\r\nhad turned monk, walked safely out upon the water and rescued the lad.\r\nGregory also tells us many stories of miraculous healing, and of one\r\nresurrection from the dead.\r\n\r\nBenedict's last days were linked with a touching incident. His sister,\r\nScholastica, presided over a convent near his own. They met once a year.\r\nOn his last visit to her, Scholastica begged him to remain and \"speak of\r\nthe joys of Heaven till the morning.\" But Benedict would not listen; he\r\nmust return. His sister then buried her face in her hands weeping and\r\npraying. Suddenly the sky was overcast with clouds, and a terrific storm\r\nburst upon the mountains, which prevented her brother's return. Three\r\ndays later Benedict saw the soul of his sister entering heaven. On March\r\n21, 543, a short time after his sister's death, two monks beheld a\r\nshining pathway of stars over which the soul of Benedict passed from\r\nMonte Cassino to heaven. Such, in brief, is the story preserved for us\r\nin his biography by the celebrated patron of monasticism, Pope\r\nGregory I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rules of Benedict_\r\n\r\nThe rules, _regulae_, of St. Benedict, are worthy of special\r\nconsideration, since they constitute the real foundation of his success\r\nand of his fame. His order was by far the most important monastic\r\nbrotherhood until the thirteenth century. Nearly all the other orders\r\nwhich sprang up during this interval were based upon Benedictine rules,\r\nand were really attempts to reform the monastic system on the basis of\r\nBenedict's original practice. Other monks lived austere lives and worked\r\nmiracles, and some of them formulated rules, but it is to Benedict and\r\nhis rules that we must look for the code of Western monachism. \"By a\r\nstrange parallelism,\" says Putnam, \"almost in the very year in which the\r\ngreat Emperor Justinian was codifying the results of seven centuries of\r\nRoman secular legislation for the benefit of the judges and the\r\nstatesmen of the new Europe, Benedict, on his lonely mountain-top, was\r\ncomposing his code for the regulation of the daily life of the great\r\ncivilizers of Europe for seven centuries to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules consist of a preface and seventy-three chapters. The prologue\r\ndefines the classes of monks, and explains the aim of the \"school of\r\ndivine servitude,\" as Benedict described his monastery. The following is\r\na partial list of the subjects considered: The character of an abbot,\r\nsilence, maxims for good works, humility, directions as to divine\r\nservice, rules for dormitories, penalties, duties of various monastic\r\nofficers, poverty, care of the sick daily rations of food and drink,\r\nhours for meals, fasting, entertainment of guests, and dress. They close\r\nwith the statement that the Benedictine rule is not offered as an ideal\r\nof perfection, or even as equal to the teaching of Cassian or Basil, but\r\nfor mere beginners in the spiritual life, who may thence\r\nproceed further.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine novitiate extended over one year, but was subsequently\r\nincreased to three. At the close of this period the novice was given the\r\nopportunity to go back into the world. If he still persisted in his\r\nchoice, he swore before the bones of the saints to remain forever cut\r\noff from the rest of his fellow beings. If a monk left the monastery, or\r\nwas expelled, he could return twice, but if, after the third admission,\r\nhe severed his connection, the door was shut forever.\r\n\r\nThe monk passed his time in manual labor, copying manuscripts, reading,\r\nfasting and prayer. He was forbidden to receive letters, tokens or\r\ngifts, even from his nearest-relatives, without permission from the\r\nabbot. His daily food allowance was usually a pound of bread, a pint of\r\nwine, cider or ale, and sometimes fish, eggs, fruit or cheese. He was\r\ndressed in a black cowl. His clothing was to be suitable to the climate\r\nand to consist of two sets. He was also furnished with a straw mattress,\r\nblanket, quilt, pillow, knife, pen, needle, handkerchief and tablets. He\r\nwas, in all things, to submit patiently to his superior, to keep\r\nsilence, and to serve his turn in the kitchen. In the older days the\r\nmonks changed their clothes on the occasion of a bath, which used to be\r\ntaken four times a year. Later, bathing was allowed only twice a year,\r\nand the monks changed their clothes when they wished.\r\n\r\nVarious punishments were employed to correct faults. Sometimes the\r\noffender was whipped on the bare shoulders with a thick rod; others had\r\nto lie prostrate in the doorway of the church at each hour, so that the\r\nmonks passed over his body on entering or going out.\r\n\r\nThe monks formerly rose at two o'clock, and spent the day in various\r\noccupations until eight at night, when they retired. The following rules\r\nonce governed St. Gregory's Monastery in England: \"3:45 A.M. Rise. 4\r\nA.M. Matins and lauds, recited; half-hour mental prayer; prime _sung_;\r\nprime B.V.M. recited. 6:30 A.M. Private study; masses; breakfast for\r\nthose who had permission. 8 A.M. Lectures and disputations. 10 A.M.\r\nLittle hours B.V.M., recited; tierce, mass, sext, _sung_. 11:30 A.M.\r\nDinner. 12 noon. None _sung_; vespers and compline B.V.M., recited.\r\n12:30 P.M. Siesta, 1 P.M. Hebrew or Greek lecture. 2 P.M. Vespers\r\n_sung_. 2:30 P.M. Lectures and disputations. 4 P.M. Private study. 6\r\nP.M. Supper. 6:30 P.M. Recreation. 7:30 P.M. Public spiritual reading;\r\ncompline _sung_; matins and lauds B.V.M., recited; half-hour mental\r\nprayer. 8:45 P.M. Retire[D].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Appendix, Note D.]\r\n\r\nSuch a routine suggests a dreary life, but that would depend upon the\r\nmonk's temperament. Regularity of employment kept him healthy, and if he\r\ndid not take his sins too much to heart, he was free from gloom. Hill\r\nvery justly observes: \"Whenever men obey that injunction of labor, no\r\nmatter what their station, there is in the act the element of happiness,\r\nand whoever avoids that injunction, there is always the shadow of the\r\nunfulfilled curse darkening their path.\" Thus, their ideal was \"to\r\nsubdue one's self and then to devote one's self,\" which De Tocqueville\r\npronounces \"the secret of strength.\" How well they succeeded in\r\nrealizing their ideal by the methods employed we shall see later.\r\n\r\nThe term \"order,\" as applied to the Benedictines, is used in a different\r\nsense from that which it has when used of later monastic bodies. Each\r\nBenedictine house was practically independent of every other, while the\r\nhouses of the Dominicans, Franciscans or Jesuits were bound together\r\nunder one head. The family idea was peculiar to the Benedictines. The\r\nabbot was the father, and the monastery was the home where the\r\nBenedictine was content to dwell all his life. In the later monastic\r\nsocieties the monks were constantly traveling from place to place.\r\nTaunton says: \"As God made society to rest on the basis of the family,\r\nso St. Benedict saw that the spiritual family is the surest basis for\r\nthe sanctification of the souls of his monks. The monastery therefore is\r\nto him what the 'home' is to lay-folk.... From this family idea comes\r\nanother result: the very fact that St. Benedict did not found an Order\r\nbut only gave a Rule, cuts away all possibility of that narrowing\r\n_esprit de corps_ which comes so easily to a widespread and\r\nhighly-organized body.\"\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, however, it became necessary\r\nfor the general good of each family to secure some kind of union. The\r\nChapter then came into existence, which was a representative body,\r\ncomposed of the heads of the different houses and ordinary monks\r\nregularly appointed as delegates. To the Chapter were committed various\r\nmatters of jurisdiction, and also the power of sending visitors to the\r\ndifferent abbeys in the pope's name.\r\n\r\nEach society was ruled by an abbot, who governed in Christ's stead.\r\nSometimes the members of the monastery were consulted, the older ones\r\nordinarily, the whole congregation; in important matters. But implicit\r\nobedience to the abbot, as the representative of God, was demanded\r\nby the vows.\r\n\r\nThe abbot was to be elected by the monks. At various periods popes and\r\nprinces usurped this power, but the monks always claimed the right as an\r\noriginal privilege. Carlyle quotes Jocelin on Abbot Samson, who says\r\nthat the monks of St. Edmundsbury were compelled to submit their choice\r\nto Henry II., who, looking at the committee of monks somewhat sternly,\r\nsaid: \"You present to me Samson; I do not know him; had it been your\r\nprior, whom I do know, I should have accepted him; however, I will now\r\ndo as you wish. But have a care of yourselves. By the true eyes of God,\r\nif you manage badly, I will be upon you.\"\r\n\r\nIn Walter Scott's novel, \"The Abbot,\" there is an interesting contrast\r\ndrawn between the ceremonies attending an abbot's installation, when the\r\nmonasteries were in their glory, and the pitiable scenes in the days of\r\ntheir decline, when Mary Stuart was a prisoner in Lochleven. In the\r\nmonastery of Kennaquhair, which had been despoiled by the fury of the\r\ntimes, a few monks were left to mourn the mutilated statues and weep\r\nover the fragments of richly-carved Gothic pillars. Having secretly\r\nelected an abbot, they assembled in fear and trembling to invest him\r\nwith the honors of his office. \"In former times,\" says Scott, \"this was\r\none of the most splendid of the many pageants which the hierarchy of\r\nRome had devised to attract the veneration of the faithful. When the\r\nfolding doors on such solemn occasions were thrown open, and the new\r\nabbot appeared on the threshold in full-blown dignity, with ring and\r\nmitre and dalmatique and crosier, his hoary standard-bearers and\r\njuvenile dispensers of incense preceding him, and the venerable train of\r\nmonks behind him, his appearance was the signal for the magnificent\r\njubilate to rise from the organ and the music-loft and to be joined by\r\nthe corresponding bursts of 'Alleluiah' from the whole assembled\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n\"Now all was changed. Father Ambrose stood on the broken steps of the\r\nhigh altar, barefooted, as was the rule, and holding in his hand his\r\npastoral staff, for the gemmed ring and jewelled mitre had become\r\nsecular spoils. No obedient vassals came, man after man, to make their\r\nhomage and to offer the tribute which should provide their spiritual\r\nsuperior with palfrey and trappings. No bishop assisted at the solemnity\r\nto receive into the higher ranks of the church nobility a dignitary\r\nwhose voice in the legislature was as potent as his own.\"\r\n\r\nWe are enabled by this partially-quoted description to imagine the\r\nimportance attached to the election of an abbot. He became, in feudal\r\ntimes, a lord of the land, the richest man in the community, and a\r\ntremendous power in political councils and parliaments. A Benedictine\r\nabbot once confessed: \"My vow of poverty has given me a hundred thousand\r\ncrowns a year; my vow of obedience has raised me to the rank of a\r\nsovereign prince.\"\r\n\r\nNo new principle seems to be disclosed by the Benedictine rules. The\r\ncommand to labor had been emphasized even in the monasteries of Egypt.\r\nThe Basilian code contained a provision enforcing manual labor, but the\r\nwork was light and insufficient to keep the mind from brooding. The\r\nmonastery that was to succeed in the West must provide for men who not\r\nonly could toil hard, but who must do so if they were to be kept pure\r\nand true; it must welcome men accustomed to the dangerous adventures of\r\npioneer life in the vast forests of the North. The Benedictine system\r\nmet these conditions by a unique combination and application of\r\nwell-known monastic principles; by a judicious subordination of minor\r\nmatters to essential discipline; by bringing into greater prominence\r\nthe doctrine of labor; by tempering the austerities of the cell to meet\r\nthe necessities of a severe climate; and lastly, by devising a scheme of\r\nlife equally adaptable to the monk of sunny Italy and the rude Goth of\r\nthe northern forests.\r\n\r\nIt was the splendid fruition of many years of experiment amid varying\r\nresults. \"It shows,\" says Schaff, \"a true knowledge of human nature, the\r\npractical wisdom of Rome and adaptation to Western customs; it combines\r\nsimplicity with completeness, strictness with gentleness, humility with\r\ncourage and gives the whole cloister life a fixed unity and compact\r\norganization, which, like the episcopate, possessed an unlimited\r\nversatility and power of expansion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Struggle against Barbarism_\r\n\r\nNo institution has contributed as much to the amelioration of human\r\nmisery or struggled as patiently and persistently to influence society\r\nfor good as the Christian church. In spite of all that may be said\r\nagainst the followers of the Cross, it still remains true, that they\r\nhave ever been foremost in the establishment of peace and justice\r\namong men.\r\n\r\nThe problem that confronted the church when Benedict began his labors,\r\nwas no less than that of reducing a demoralized and brutal society to\r\nlaw and order. Chaos reigned, selfishness and lust ruled the hearts of\r\nRome's conquerors. The West was desolated by barbarians; the East\r\ndismembered and worn out by theological controversy. War had ruined the\r\ncommerce of the cities and laid waste the rural districts. Vast swamps\r\nand tracts of brush covered fields once beautiful with the products of\r\nagricultural labor. The minds of men were distracted by apprehensions of\r\nsome frightful, impending calamity. The cultured Roman, the untutored\r\nGoth and the corrupted Christian were locked in the deadly embrace of\r\ndespair. \"Constantly did society attempt to form itself,\" says Guizot,\r\n\"constantly was it destroyed by the act of man, by the absence of the\r\nmoral conditions under which alone it can exist.\"\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding failures and discouragements, the work of\r\nreconstructing society moved painfully on, and among the brave master\r\nbuilders was Benedict of Nursia. \"He found the world, physical and\r\nsocial, in ruins,\" says Cardinal Newman, \"and his mission was to restore\r\nit in the way,--not of science, but of nature; not as if setting about\r\nto do it; not professing to do it by any set time, or by any series of\r\nstrokes; but so quietly, patiently, gradually, that often till the work\r\nwas done, it was not known to be doing. It was a restoration rather than\r\na visitation, correction or conversion. The new world he helped to\r\ncreate was a growth rather than a structure.\"\r\n\r\nBut the chaos created by the irruption of the barbarous nations at this\r\nperiod seriously affected the moral character and influence of the\r\nclergy and the monks. The church seemed unequal to the stupendous\r\nundertaking of converting the barbarians. The monks, as a class, were\r\nlawless and vicious. Benedict himself testifies against them, and\r\ndeclares that they were \"always wandering and never stable; that they\r\nobey their own appetites, whereunto they are enslaved.\" Unable to\r\ncontrol their own desires by any law whatsoever, they were unfitted to\r\nthe task before them. It was imperative, then, that unity and order\r\nshould be introduced among the monasteries; that some sort of a uniform\r\nrule, adapted to the existing conditions, should be adopted, not only\r\nfor the preservation of the monastic institution, but for the\r\npreparation of the monks for their work. Therefore, although the\r\nChristianity of that time was far from ideal, it was, nevertheless, a\r\nreligion within the grasp of the reckless barbarians; and subsequent\r\nevents prove that it possessed a moral power capable of humanizing\r\nmanners, elevating the intellect, and checking the violent temper of\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\nExcepting always the religious services of the Benedictine monks, their\r\ngreatest contribution to civilization was literary and educational[E].\r\nThe rules of Benedict provided for two hours a day of reading, and it\r\nwas doubtless this wise regulation that stimulated literary tastes, and\r\nresulted in the collecting of books and the reproduction of manuscripts.\r\n\"Wherever a Benedictine house arose, or a monastery of any one of the\r\nOrders, which were but offshoots from the Benedictine tree, books were\r\nmultiplied and a library came into existence, small indeed at first, but\r\nincreasing year by year, till the wealthier houses had gathered together\r\ncollections of books that would do credit to a modern university.\"\r\nThere was great danger that the remains of classic literature might be\r\ndestroyed in the general devastation of Italy. The monasteries rescued\r\nthe literary fragments that escaped, and preserved them. \"For a period\r\nof more than six centuries the safety of the literary heritage of\r\nEurope,--one may say of the world,--depended upon the scribes of a few\r\ndozen scattered monasteries.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Appendix, Note E.]\r\n\r\nThe literary services of the earlier monks did not consist in original\r\nproduction, but in the reproduction and preservation of the classics.\r\nThis work was first begun as a part of the prescribed routine of\r\nEuropean monastic life in the monastery at Vivaria, or Viviers, France,\r\nwhich was founded by Cassiodorus about 539. The rules of this cloister\r\nwere based on those of Cassian, who died in the early part of the fifth\r\ncentury. Benedict, at Monte Cassino, followed the example of\r\nCassiodorus, and the Benedictine Order carried the work on for the seven\r\nsucceeding centuries.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus was a statesman of no mean ability, and for over forty years\r\nwas active in the political circles of his time, holding high official\r\npositions under five different Roman rulers. He was also an exceptional\r\nscholar, devoting much of his energy to the preservation of classic\r\nliterature. His magnificent collection of manuscripts, rescued from the\r\nruins of Italian libraries, \"supplied material for the pens of thousands\r\nof monastic scribes.\" If we leave out Jerome, it is to Cassiodorus that\r\nthe honor is due for joining learning and monasticism.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" remarks Schaff, \"that very mode of life, which, in its founder,\r\nAnthony, despised all learning, became in the course of its development\r\nan asylum of culture in the rough and stormy times of the migration and\r\nthe crusades, and a conservator of the literary treasures of antiquity\r\nfor the use of modern times.\"\r\n\r\nCassiodorus, with a noble enthusiasm, inspired his monks to their task.\r\nHe even provided lamps of ingenious construction, that seem to have been\r\nself-trimming, to aid them in their work. He himself set an example of\r\nliterary diligence, astonishing in one of his age.\r\n\r\nPutnam is justified in his praises of this remarkable character when he\r\ndeclares: \"It is not too much to say that the continuity of thought and\r\ncivilization of the ancient world with that of the middle ages was due,\r\nmore than to any other one man, to the life and labors of Cassiodorus.\"\r\n\r\nBut the monk was more than a scribe and a collector of books, he became\r\nthe chronicler and the school-teacher. \"The records that have come down\r\nto us of several centuries of medieval European history are due almost\r\nexclusively to the labors of the monastic chroniclers.\" A vast fund of\r\ninformation, the value of which is impaired, it is true, by much useless\r\nstuff, concerning medieval customs, laws and events, was collected by\r\nthese unscientific historians and is now accessible to the student.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ninth century nearly all the monasteries of Europe\r\nconducted schools open to the children of the neighborhood. The\r\ncharacter of the educational training of the times is not to be judged\r\nby modern standards. A beginning had to be made, and that too at a time\r\n\"when neither local nor national governments had assumed any\r\nresponsibilities in connection with elementary education, and when the\r\nmunicipalities were too ignorant, and in many cases too poor, to make\r\nprovision for the education of the children.\" It is therefore to the\r\nlasting credit of Benedict, inspired no doubt by the example of\r\nCassiodorus, that he commanded his monks to read, encouraged literary\r\nwork, and made provision for the education of the young.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictines rendered a great social service in reclaiming deserted\r\nregions and in clearing forests. \"The monasteries,\" says Maitland,\r\n\"were, in those days of misrule and turbulence, beyond all price, not\r\nonly as places where (it may be imperfectly, but better than elsewhere)\r\nGod was worshipped,... but as central points whence agriculture was to\r\nspread over bleak hills and barren downs and marshy plains, and deal its\r\nbread to millions perishing with hunger and its pestilential train.\"\r\nRoman taxation and barbarian invasions had ruined the farmers, who left\r\ntheir lands and fled to swell the numbers of the homeless. The monk\r\nrepeopled these abandoned but once fertile fields, and carried\r\ncivilization still deeper into the forests. Many a monastery with its\r\nsurrounding buildings became the nucleus of a modern city. The more\r\nawful the darkness of the forest solitudes, the more the monks loved\r\nit. They cut down trees in the heart of the wilderness, and transformed\r\na soil bristling with woods and thickets into rich pastures and ploughed\r\nfields. They stimulated the peasantry to labor, and taught them many\r\nuseful lessons in agriculture. Thus, they became an industrial, as well\r\nas a spiritual, agency for good.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the monks brought them into close contact with nature.\r\nEven the animals became their friends. Numerous stories have been\r\nrelated of their wonderful power over wild beasts and their\r\nconversations with the birds. \"It is wonderful,\" says Bede, \"that he who\r\nfaithfully and loyally obeys the Creator of the universe, should, in his\r\nturn, see all the creatures obedient to his orders and his wishes.\" They\r\nlived, so we are told, in the most intimate relations with the animal\r\ncreation. Squirrels leaped to their hands or hid in the folds of their\r\ncowls. Stags came out of the forests in Ireland and offered themselves\r\nto some monks who were ploughing, to replace the oxen carried off by the\r\nhunters. Wild animals stopped in their pursuit of game at the command of\r\nSt. Laumer. Birds ceased singing at the request of some monks until\r\nthey had chanted their evening prayer, and at their word the feathered\r\nsongsters resumed their music. A swan was the daily companion of St.\r\nHugh of Lincoln, and manifested its miraculous knowledge of his\r\napproaching death by the most profound melancholy. While all the details\r\nof such stories are not to be accepted as literally true, no doubt some\r\nof this poetry of monastic history rests upon interesting and\r\ncharming facts.\r\n\r\nA fuller discussion of the permanent contributions which the monk made\r\nto civilization is reserved for the last chapter. I have somewhat\r\nanticipated a closer scrutiny of his achievements in order to present a\r\nclearer view of his life and labors. His religious duties were, perhaps,\r\nwearisome enough. We might tire of his monotonous chanting and incessant\r\nvigils, but it is gratifying to know that he also engaged in practical\r\nand useful employments. The convent became the house of industry as well\r\nas the temple of prayer. The forest glades echoed to the stroke of the\r\naxe as well as to hymns of praise. Yes, as Carlyle writes of the twelfth\r\ncentury, \"these years were no chimerical vacuity and dreamland peopled\r\nwith mere vaporous phantasms, but a green solid place, that grew corn\r\nand several other things. The sun shone on it, the vicissitudes of\r\nseasons and human fortunes. Cloth was woven and worn; ditches were dug,\r\nfurrowed fields ploughed and houses built.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spread of the Benedictine Rule_\r\n\r\nIt is generally held that Benedict had no presentiment of the vast\r\nhistorical importance of his system; and that he aspired to nothing\r\nbeyond the salvation of his own soul and those of his brethren.\r\n\r\nBut the rule spread with wonderful rapidity. In every rich valley arose\r\na Benedictine abbey. Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, France and Spain\r\nadopted his rule. Princes, moved by various motives, hastened to bestow\r\ngrants of land on the indefatigable missionary who, undeterred by the\r\nwildness of the forest and the fierceness of the barbarian, settled in\r\nthe remotest regions. In the various societies of the Benedictines there\r\nhave been thirty-seven thousand monasteries and one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand abbots. For the space of two hundred and thirty-nine years the\r\nBenedictines governed the church by forty-eight popes chosen from their\r\norder. They boast of two hundred cardinals, seven thousand archbishops,\r\nfifteen thousand bishops and four thousand saints. The astonishing\r\nassertion is also made that no less than twenty emperors and forty-seven\r\nkings resigned their crowns to become Benedictine monks. Their convents\r\nclaim ten empresses and fifty queens. Many of these earthly rulers\r\nretired to the seclusion of the monastery because their hopes had been\r\ncrushed by political defeat, or their consciences smitten by reason of\r\ncrime or other sins. Some were powerfully attracted by the heroic\r\nelement of monastic life, and these therefore spurned the luxuries and\r\nemoluments of royalty, in order by personal sacrifice to achieve\r\nspiritual domination in this life, and to render their future salvation\r\ncertain. But whatever the motive that drew queens and princes to the\r\nmonastic order, the retirement of such large numbers of the nobility\r\nindicates the influence of a religious system which could cope so\r\nsuccessfully with the attractions of the palace and the natural passion\r\nfor political dominion.\r\n\r\nSaint Gregory the Great, the biographer of Benedict, who was born at\r\nRome in 540 A.D. and so was nearly contemporaneous with Benedict was a\r\nzealous promoter of the monastic ideal, and did as much as any one to\r\nadvance its ecclesiastical position and influence. He founded seven\r\nmonasteries with his paternal inheritance, and became the abbot of one\r\nof them. He often expressed a desire to escape the clamor of the world\r\nby retirement to a lonely cell. Inspired by the loftiest estimates of\r\nhis holy office, he sought to reform the church in its spirit and life.\r\nMany of his innovations in the church service bordered upon a dangerous\r\nand glittering pomp; but the musical world will always revere his memory\r\nfor the famous chants that bear his name.\r\n\r\nGregory surrounded himself with monks, and did everything in his power\r\nto promote their interests. He increased the novitiate to two years, and\r\nexempted certain monasteries from the control of the bishops. Other\r\npopes added to these exemptions, and thus widened the breach which\r\nalready existed between the secular clergy and the monks. He also fixed\r\na penalty of lifelong imprisonment for abandonment of the\r\nmonastic life.\r\n\r\nUnder Gregory's direction many missionary enterprises were carried on,\r\nnotably that of Augustine to England. The story runs that one day\r\nGregory saw some men and beautiful children from Britain put up for sale\r\nin the market-place. Deeply sighing, he exclaimed: \"Alas for grief! That\r\nthe author of darkness possesses men of so bright countenance, and that\r\nso great grace of aspect bears a mind void of inward grace!\" He then\r\nasked the children the name of their nation. \"Angles,\" was the reply.\r\n\"It is well,\" he said, \"for they have _angelic_ faces. What is the name\r\nof your province?\" It was answered, \"Deira.\" \"Truly,\" he said,\r\n\"_De-ira-ns,_ drawn from anger, and called to the mercy of Christ. How\r\nis your king called?\" They answered, \"Ælla, or Ella.\" Then he cried\r\n\"_Alleluia!_ it behooves that the praise of God the Creator should be\r\nsung in those parts.\" While it is hard to accept this evidently fanciful\r\nstory in its details, it seems quite probable that the sale of some\r\nEnglish slaves in a Roman market drew the attention of Gregory to the\r\nneeds of Britain.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards, in 596, Gregory commissioned Augustine, prior of\r\nthe monastery of St. Andrew's on the Celian Hill, at Rome, with forty\r\ncompanions, to preach the gospel in Britain. When this celebrated\r\nmissionary landed on the island of Thanet, he found monasticism had\r\npreceded him. But what was the nature of this British monasticism? On\r\nthat question Rome and England are divided.\r\n\r\nThe Romanist declares that no country received the Christian faith more\r\ndirectly from the Church of Rome than did England; that the most careful\r\nstudy of authentic records reveals no doctrinal strife, no diversity of\r\nbelief between the early British monks and the Pope of Rome; that St.\r\nPatrick, of Ireland, and St. Columba, of Scotland, were loyal sons of\r\ntheir Roman mother.\r\n\r\nThe Anglican, on the other hand, believes that Christianity was\r\nintroduced into Britain independently of Rome. As to the precise means\r\nemployed, he has his choice of ten legends. He may hold with Lane that\r\nit is reasonable to suppose one of Paul's ardent converts, burning with\r\nfervent zeal, led the Britons to the cross. Or he may argue with others:\r\n\"What is more natural than to imagine that Joseph of Arimathea, driven\r\nfrom Palestine, sailed away to Britain.\" In proof of this assumption, we\r\nare shown the chapel of St. Joseph, the remains of the oldest Christian\r\nchurch, where the holy-thorn blossoms earlier than in any other part of\r\nEngland. Many Anglicans wisely regard all this as legendary. It is also\r\nheld that St. Patrick and St. Columba were not Romanists, but\r\nrepresented a type of British Christianity, which, although temporarily\r\nsubjected to Rome, yet finally threw off the yoke under Henry VIII. and\r\nreasserted its ancient independence. Still others declare that when\r\nAugustine was made archbishop, the seat of ecclesiastical authority was\r\ntransferred from Rome to Canterbury, and the English church became an\r\nindependent branch of the universal church. It was Catholic, but\r\nnot Roman.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of ascertaining when and by whom Christianity was\r\noriginally introduced into southern Britain must be apparent to every\r\nstudent. But some things may be regarded as historically certain. The\r\nwhole country had been desolated by war when Augustine arrived. For a\r\nhundred and fifty years the brutality and ignorance of the barbarians\r\nhad reigned supreme. All traces of Roman civilization had nearly\r\ndisappeared with the conquest of the heathen Anglo-Saxons. Whatever may\r\nbe thought about the subsequent effects of the triumph of Roman\r\nChristianity, it is due to Rome to recognize the fact that with the\r\ncoming of the Roman missionaries religion and knowledge began a\r\nnew life.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons had destroyed the Christian churches and monasteries,\r\nwhose origin, as we have seen, is unknown. They drove away or massacred\r\nthe priests and monks. Christianity was practically extirpated in those\r\ndistricts subject to the Germanic yoke. But when Augustine landed\r\nBritish monks were still to be found in various obscure parts of the\r\ncountry, principally in Ireland and Wales. Judging from what is known of\r\nthese monks, it is safe to say that their habits and teachings were\r\nbased on the traditions of an earlier Christianity, and that originally\r\nBritish Christianity was independent of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe monks in Britain at the time when Augustine landed differed from the\r\nRoman monks in their tonsures, their liturgy, and the observance of\r\nEaster, although no material difference in doctrine can be established.\r\nThe clergy did not always observe the law of celibacy nor perhaps the\r\nRoman rules of baptism. It is also admitted, even by Catholic\r\nhistorians, that the British monks refused to acknowledge Augustine\r\ntheir archbishop; that this question divided the royal family; and that\r\nthe old British church was not completely subdued until Henry II.\r\nconquered Ireland and Wales. These statements are practically supported\r\nby Ethelred L. Taunton, an authoritative writer, whose sympathy with\r\nRoman monasticism is very strong. He thinks that a few of the British\r\nmonks submitted to Augustine, but of the rest he says: \"They would not\r\nheed the call of Augustine, and on frivolous pretexts refused to\r\nacknowledge him.\" A large body of British monks retired to the monastery\r\nof Bangor, and when King Ethelfrid invaded the district of Wales, he\r\nslew twelve hundred of them in the open field as they were upon their\r\nknees praying for the success of the Britons. It was then that the power\r\nof the last remnants of Celtic or British Christianity was practically\r\nbroken, and the Roman type henceforth gradually acquired the mastery.\r\n\r\nMontalembert says: \"In no other country has Catholicism been persecuted\r\nwith more sanguinary zeal; and, at the same time, none has greater need\r\nof her care.\" While the latter observation is open to dispute, it is\r\ncertainly true that England has never remained quiet under the dominion\r\nof Rome. Goldsmith's tribute to the English character suggests a\r\nreasonable explanation of this historic fact:\r\n\r\n     \"Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state,\r\n     Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,\r\n     True to imagined right, above control,\r\n     While even the peasant boasts those rights to scan,\r\n     And learns to venerate himself as man.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact to be remembered, as we emerge from these ecclesiastical\r\nquarrels and the confusions of this perplexing history, is that the\r\nmonks were the intellectual and religious leaders of those days. They\r\nexercised a profound influence upon English society, and had much to do\r\nwith the establishment of English institutions.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the continent is indebted to England for the\r\ngift of many noble monks who served France and Germany as intellectual\r\nand moral guides, at a time when these countries were in a state of\r\nextreme degradation. Boniface, the Apostle to the Germans, who is\r\nregarded by Neander as the Father of the German church and the real\r\nfounder of the Christian civilization of Germany, was the gift of the\r\nEnglish cloisters, and a native of Devonshire. Alcuin, the\r\necclesiastical prime minister of Charlemagne and the greatest educator\r\nof his time, was born and trained in England. Nearly all the leading\r\nschools of France were founded or improved by this celebrated monk. It\r\nwas largely due to Alcuin's unrivaled energy and splendid talents that\r\nCharlemagne was able to make so many and so glorious educational\r\nimprovements in his empire.\r\n\r\nNotable among the men who introduced the Benedictine rule into England\r\nwas St. Wilfred (634-709 A.D.), who had traveled extensively in France\r\nand Italy, and on his return carried the monastic rule into northern\r\nBritain. He also is credited with establishing a course of musical\r\ntraining in the English monasteries. He was the most active prelate of\r\nhis age in the founding of churches and monasteries, and in securing\r\nuniformity of discipline and harmony with the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous monastic retreats of those days was the wild and\r\nlonely isle of Iona, the Mecca of monks and the monastic capital of\r\nScotland. It is a small island, three miles long and one broad, lying\r\nwest of Scotland. Many kings of Scotland were crowned here on a stone\r\nwhich now forms a part of the British coronation chair. Its great\r\nmonastery enjoyed the distinction from the sixth to the eighth century\r\nof being second to none in its widespread influence in behalf of the\r\nintellectual life of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis monastery was originally founded in the middle of the sixth century\r\nby Columba, the Apostle to Caledonia, an Irish saint actively associated\r\nwith a wonderful intellectual awakening. The rule of the monastery is\r\nunknown, but it is probable that it could not have been, at the first,\r\nof the Benedictine type. Columba's followers traveled as missionaries\r\nand teachers to all parts of Europe, and it is said, they dared to sail\r\nin their small boats even as far as Iceland.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson says in his \"Tour to the Hebrides\": \"We are now treading\r\nthat illustrious island which was once the luminary of the Caledonian\r\nregions, whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits\r\nof knowledge and the blessing of religion. That man is little to be\r\nenvied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon,\r\nor whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.\" The\r\nmonastery which Columba founded here was doubtless of the same character\r\nas the establishments in Ireland. Many of these Celtic buildings were\r\nmade of the branches of trees and supported by wooden props. It was some\r\ntime before properly-constructed wooden churches or monasteries became\r\ngeneral in these wild regions. In such rude huts small libraries were\r\ncollected and the monks trained to preach. Ireland was then the center\r\nof knowledge in the North. Greek, Latin, music and such science as the\r\nmonks possessed were taught to eager pupils. Copies of their manuscripts\r\nare still to be found all over Europe. Their schools were open to the\r\nrich and poor alike. The monks went from house to house teaching and\r\ndistributing literature. As late as the sixteenth century, students from\r\nvarious parts of the Continent were to be found in these Irish schools.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting story related of Columba's literary activities.\r\nIt is said that on one occasion while visiting his master, Finnian, he\r\nundertook to make a clandestine copy of the abbot's Psalter. When the\r\nmaster learned of the fact, he indignantly charged Columba with theft,\r\nand demanded the copy which he had made, on the ground that a copy made\r\nwithout permission of the author was the property of the original owner,\r\nbecause a transcript is the offspring of the original work. Putnam, to\r\nwhom I am indebted for this story, says: \"As far as I have been able to\r\nascertain, this is the first instance which occurs in the history of\r\nEuropean literature of a contention for a copyright.\" The conflict for\r\nthis copyright afterwards developed into a civil war. The copy of the\r\nLatin Psalter \"was enshrined in the base of a portable altar as the\r\nnational relic of the O'Donnell clan,\" and was preserved by that family\r\nfor thirteen hundred years. It was placed on exhibition as late as 1867,\r\nin the museum of the Royal Irish Academy.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to enable the reader to understand something of\r\nthe spirit and labors of the monks in an age characteristically\r\nbarbaric. For five centuries, from the fifth to the tenth, the\r\ncondition of Europe was deplorable. \"It may be doubted,\" says an old\r\nwriter, \"whether the worst of the Cæsars exceeded in dark malignity, or\r\nin capriciousness of vengeance, the long-haired kings of France.\" The\r\nmoral sense of even the most saintly churchmen seems to have been\r\nblunted by familiarity with atrocities and crimes. Brute force was the\r\ncommon method of exercising control and administering justice. The\r\nbarbarians were bold and independent, but cruel and superstitious. Their\r\nfurious natures needed taming and their rude minds tutoring. Even though\r\nduring this period churches and monasteries were raised in amazing\r\nnumbers, yet the spirit of barbarism was so strong that the Christians\r\ncould scarcely escape its influence. The power of Christianity was\r\nmodified by the nature of the people, whose characters it aimed to\r\ntransform. The remarks of William Newton Clarke respecting the\r\nChristians of the first and second centuries are also appropriate to the\r\nperiod under review: \"The people were changed by the new faith, but the\r\nnew faith was changed by the people.\" Christianity \"made a new people,\r\nbetter than it found them, but they in turn made a new Christianity,\r\nwith its strong points illustrated and confirmed in their experience,\r\nbut with weakness brought in from their defects.\"\r\n\r\nYes, the work of civilizing the Germanic nations was a task of herculean\r\nproportions and of tremendous significance. Out of these tribes were to\r\nbe constructed the nations of modern Europe. To this important mission\r\nthe monks addressed themselves with such courage, patience, faith and\r\nzeal, as to entitle them to the veneration of posterity. With singular\r\nwisdom and unflinching bravery they carried on their missionary and\r\neducational enterprises, in the face of discouragements and obstacles\r\nsufficient to dismay the bravest souls. The tenacious strength of those\r\nwild forces that clashed with the tenderer influences of the cloister\r\nshould soften our criticism of the inconsistencies which detract from\r\nthe glory of those early ministers of righteousness and exemplars of\r\ngentleness and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_REFORMED AND MILITARY ORDERS_\r\n\r\nThe monastic institution was never entirely good or entirely bad. In\r\nperiods of general degradation there were beautiful exceptions in\r\nmonasteries ruled by pure and powerful abbots. From the beginning\r\nvarious monasteries soon departed from their discipline by sheltering\r\niniquity and laziness, while other establishments faithfully observed\r\nthe rules. But during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries there was a\r\nwidespread decline in the spirit of devotion and a shameful relaxation\r\nof monastic discipline. Malmesbury, King Alfred, Alcuin, in England, and\r\nmany continental writers, sorrowfully testified against the monks\r\nbecause of their vices, their revelings, their vain and gorgeous\r\nornaments of dress and their waning zeal for virtue. The priests hunted\r\nand fought, prayed, preached, swore and drank as they pleased. \"We\r\ncannot wonder,\" says an anonymous historian, \"that they should commit\r\nthe more reasonable offence of taking wives.\" Disorders were common\r\neverywhere; the monastic vows were sadly neglected. Political and\r\nreligious ideals were lost sight of amid the prevailing confusion and\r\nwild commotion of those dark days. \"It is true,\" says Carlyle, \"all\r\nthings have two faces, a light one and a dark. It is true in three\r\ncenturies much imperfection accumulates; many an ideal, monastic or\r\notherwise, shooting forth into practice as it can, grows to a strange\r\nreality; and we have to ask with amazement, Is this your ideal? For alas\r\nthe ideal has to grow into the real, and to seek out its bed and board\r\nthere, often in a sorry way.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, may be accepted as the usual history of a monastery or a\r\nmonastic order. First, vows of poverty, obedience and chastity zealously\r\ncherished and observed; as a result of loyalty to this ideal, a spirit\r\nof devotion to righteousness is created, and a pure, lofty type of\r\nChristian life is formed, which, if not the highest and truest, is\r\nsufficiently exalted to win the reverence of worldly men and an\r\nextra-ordinary power over their lives and affections. There naturally\r\nfollow numerous and valuable gifts of land and gold. The monks become\r\nrich as well as powerful. Then the decline begins. Vast riches have\r\nalways been a menace to true spirituality. Perhaps they always will be.\r\nThe wealthy monk falls a prey to pride and arrogance; he becomes\r\nluxurious in his habits, and lazy in the performance of duty. Vice\r\ncreeps in and his moral ruin is complete. The transformation in the\r\ncharacter of the monk is accompanied by a change in public opinion. The\r\nmonk is now an eyesore; his splendid buildings are viewed with envy by\r\nsome, with shame by others. Then arise the vehement cries for the\r\ndestruction of his palatial cloister, and the heroic efforts of the\r\nremnant that abide faithful to reform the institution. This has been the\r\npathway over which every monastic order has traveled. As long as there\r\nwas sufficient vitality to give birth to reformatory movements, new\r\nsocieties sprang up as off-shoots of the older orders, some of which\r\nadopted the original rules, while others altered them to suit the views\r\nof the reforming founder. \"For indeed,\" says Trench, \"those orders,\r\nwonderful at their beginning, and girt up so as to take heaven by storm,\r\nseemed destined to travel in a mournful circle from which there was no\r\nescape.\" These facts partly explain the reformatory movements which\r\nappear from the ninth century on.\r\n\r\nThe first great saint to enter the lists against monastic corruption was\r\nBenedict of Aniane (750-821 A.D.), a member of a distinguished family in\r\nsouthern France. The Benedictine rule in his opinion was formed for\r\nnovices and invalids. He attributed the prevailing laxity among the\r\nmonks to the mild discipline. As abbot of a monastery he undertook to\r\nreform its affairs by adopting a system based on Basil of Asia Minor and\r\nPachomius of Egypt. But he leaned too far back for human nature in the\r\nWest, and the conclusion was forced upon him that Benedict of Nursia had\r\nformulated a set of rules as strict as could be enforced among the\r\nWestern monks. Accordingly he directed his efforts to secure a faithful\r\nobservance of the original Benedictine rules, adding, however, a number\r\nof rigid and burdensome regulations. Although at first the monks doubted\r\nhis sanity, kicked him and spat on him, yet he afterwards succeeded in\r\ngathering about three hundred of them under his rule. Several colonies\r\nwere sent out from his monastery, which was built on his patrimonial\r\nestate near Montpellier. His last establishment, which was located near\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, became famous as a center of learning and sanctity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated reform monasteries was the convent of Cluny,\r\nor Clugny, in Burgundy, about fifteen miles from Lyons, which was\r\nfounded by Duke William of Aquitaine in 910. It was governed by a code\r\nbased on the rule of St. Benedict. The monastery began with twelve monks\r\nunder Bruno, but became so illustrious that under Hugo there were ten\r\nthousand monks in the various convents under its rule. It was made\r\nimmediately subject to the pope,--that is, exempt from the jurisdiction\r\nof the bishop. Some idea of its splendid equipment may be formed from\r\nthe fact that it is said, that in 1245, after the council of Lyons, it\r\nentertained Innocent IV., two patriarchs, twelve cardinals, three\r\narchbishops, fifteen bishops, many abbots, St. Louis, King of France,\r\nseveral princes and princesses, each with a considerable retinue, yet\r\nthe monks were not incommoded. It gave to the church three\r\npopes,--Gregory VII., Urban II. and Paschal II.\r\n\r\nFrom his cell at Cluny, Hildebrand, who became the famous Gregory VII.,\r\nlooked out upon a world distracted by war and sunk in vice. \"In\r\nHildebrand's time, while he was studying those annals in Cluny,\" says\r\nThomas Starr King, \"a boy pope, twelve years old, was master of the\r\nspiritual scepter, and was beginning to lead a life so shameful, foul\r\nand execrable that a subsequent pope said, 'he shuddered to\r\ndescribe it.'\"\r\n\r\nConnected with the monastery was the largest church in the world,\r\nsurpassed only a little, in later years, by St. Peter's at Rome. Its\r\nconstruction was begun in 1089 by the abbot Hugo, and it was consecrated\r\nin 1131, under the administration of Peter the Venerable. It boasted of\r\ntwenty-five altars and many costly works of art.\r\n\r\nSo great was the fame and influence of this establishment that numerous\r\nconvents in France and Italy placed themselves under its control, thus\r\nforming \"The Congregation of Cluny.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the administration of Peter the Venerable (1122-1156), this\r\nillustrious house began to succumb to the intoxication of success, and\r\nit steadily declined in character and influence until its property was\r\nconfiscated by the Constituent Assembly, in 1799, and the church sold\r\nfor one hundred thousand francs. It is now in ruin.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of every attempt at reform during the ninth and tenth\r\ncenturies the decline of the continental monasteries continued. Many\r\npersons of royal blood, accustomed to the license of palaces, entered\r\nthe cloister and increased the disorders. The monks naturally respected\r\ntheir blood and relaxed the discipline in their favor. The result was\r\ncostly robes, instead of the simple, monastic garb, riotous living, and\r\na general indifference to spirituality. Spurious monasteries sprang up\r\nwith rich lay-abbots at their head, who made the office hereditary in\r\ntheir families. Laymen were appointed to rich benefices simply that they\r\nmight enjoy the revenues. These lay-abbots even went so far as to live\r\nwith their families in their monasteries, and rollicking midnight\r\nbanquets were substituted for the asceticism demanded by the vows. They\r\ntraveled extensively attended by splendid retinues. Some of the monks\r\nseemed intent on nothing but obtaining charters of privileges and\r\nexemptions from civil and military duties.\r\n\r\nIn England the state of affairs was even more distressing than on the\r\nContinent. The evil effects of the Saxon invasion, the demoralization\r\nthat accompanied the influx of paganism, and the almost complete\r\ndestruction of the religious institutions of British Christianity have\r\nalready been noted. About the year 700, the island was divided among\r\nfifteen petty chiefs, who waged war against one another almost\r\nincessantly. Christianity, as introduced by Augustine, had somewhat\r\nmitigated the ferocity of war, and England had begun to make some\r\napproach toward a respect for law and a veneration for the Christian\r\nreligion, when the Danes came, and with them another period of\r\ndisgraceful atrocities and blighting heathenism. The Danish invasion had\r\nalmost extirpated the monastic institution in the northern districts.\r\nCarnage and devastation reigned everywhere. Celebrated monasteries fell\r\nin ruins and the monks were slain or driven into exile. Hordes of\r\nbarbaric warriors roamed the country, burning and plundering.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of this calamitous period,\" says Lingard, in his \"History\r\nand Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church,\" \"the Anglo-Saxon church\r\npresented a melancholy spectacle to the friends of religion: 1. The\r\nlaity had resumed the ferocious manners of their pagan forefathers. 2.\r\nThe clergy had grown indolent, dissolute and illiterate. 3. The monastic\r\norder had been apparently annihilated. It devolved on King Alfred,\r\nvictorious over his enemies, to devise and apply the remedies for these\r\nevils.\" The good king endeavored to restore the monastic institution,\r\nbut, owing to the lack of candidates for the monastic habit, he was\r\ncompelled to import a colony of monks from Gaul.\r\n\r\nThe moral results of Alfred's reformatory measures, as well as those of\r\nhis immediate successors, were far from satisfactory, although he did\r\nvastly stimulate the educational work of the monastic schools. He\r\ndevoted himself so faithfully to the gathering of traditions, that he is\r\nsaid to be the father of English history. The tide of immorality,\r\nhowever, was too strong to be stemmed in a generation or two. It was a\r\ncentury and a half before there was even an approach to substantial\r\nvictory over the disgraceful abuses among the clergy and the monks.\r\n\r\nThe churchman who is credited with doing most to distinguish the monks\r\nas a zealous and faithful body was Dunstan (924-988 A.D.), first Abbot\r\nof Glastonbury, then Bishop of Winchester, and finally Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. He is the most conspicuous ecclesiastical personage in the\r\nhistory of those dark days, but his character and labors have given rise\r\nto bitter and extensive controversy.\r\n\r\nIt was Dunstan's chief aim to subjugate the Anglo-Saxon church to the\r\npower of Rome, and to correct existing abuses by compelling the clergy\r\nand the monks to obey the rule of celibacy. He was a fervent believer in\r\nthe efficacy of the Benedictine vows, and in the value of clerical\r\ncelibacy as a remedy for clerical licentiousness. Naturally, Protestant\r\nwriters, who hold that papal supremacy never was a blessing in any\r\ncountry or in any age, and who think that clerical celibacy has always\r\nbeen a fruitful source of crime and sin, condemn the reforms of Dunstan\r\nin the most unqualified terms. A statement of a few of the many and\r\nperplexing facts may assist us to form a fairly just judgment of the\r\nman and his work.\r\n\r\nThe principle of sacerdotal celibacy appeared early in the history of\r\nChristianity, and for many centuries it was the subject of sharp\r\ncontention. Roman Catholics themselves have been divided upon it. In\r\nevery Christian country, from the Apostolic period onward, there were\r\npriests and teachers who opposed the imposition of this rule upon the\r\nclergy, and, on the other hand, there were those who practiced and\r\nadvocated celibacy as the indispensable guarantee of spiritual power\r\nand purity.\r\n\r\nWhat the rule of celibacy was at this period, in England, seems\r\nuncertain. Lingard maintains that marriage was always permitted to the\r\nclergy in minor orders, who were employed in various subordinate\r\npositions, but that those in higher orders, whose office it was to\r\nminister at the altar and to offer the sacrifice, were expressly bound\r\nto a life of the strictest continence. During the invasion of the Danes,\r\nwhen confusion reigned, many priests in the higher orders had not only\r\nforsaken their vows of chastity, but had plunged into frightful\r\nimmoralities; and married clerks of inferior orders were raised to the\r\npriesthood to fill the ranks depleted by war. These promoted clerks were\r\npreviously required to separate from their wives, but apparently many of\r\nthem did not do so. Consequently, from several causes, the married\r\npriests became a numerous body, and since the common opinion seems to\r\nhave been that a married priest was disgracing his office, this body was\r\nregarded as a menace to the welfare of the church and the state.\r\n\r\nLea, in his elaborate \"History of Sacerdotal Celibacy,\" holds that the\r\nrule of celibacy was only binding on the regulars, or monks, and that\r\nthe secular priesthood was at liberty to marry. But from several other\r\npassages in his work it seems that he also recognizes the fact that,\r\nwhile marriage was common, it was in defiance of an ancient canon. \"It\r\nis evident,\" he says, \"that the memory of the ancient canons was not\r\nforgotten, and that their observance was still urged by some ardent\r\nchurchmen, but that the customs of the period had rendered them\r\nvirtually obsolete, and that no sufficient means existed of enforcing\r\nobedience. If open scandals and shameless bigamy and concubinage could\r\nbe restrained, the ecclesiastical authorities were evidently content.\r\nCelibacy could not be enjoined as a law, but was rendered attractive by\r\nsurrounding it with privileges and immunities denied to him who yielded\r\nto the temptations of the flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout Western Christendom the law of celibacy was openly and\r\nshamefully trampled upon, and every reformer seemed to think that the\r\nvery first step toward any improvement in clerical morals was to be\r\ntaken by enforcing this rule.\r\n\r\nWhen Dunstan commenced his reforms, the clergy were guilty of graver\r\nsins than that of living in marriage relations. Adultery, bigamy,\r\nswearing, fighting and drinking were the order of the day. The\r\nmonasteries were occupied by secular priests with wives or concubines.\r\nAll the chroniclers of this period agree in charging the monks and\r\nclergy with a variety of dissipations and disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear, therefore, that in Dunstan's view he was doing the\r\nonly right thing in trying to correct the existing abuses by compelling\r\nthe priests to adopt that celibate life without which it was popularly\r\nbelieved the highest holiness and the largest usefulness could not be\r\nattained. In the light of this purpose and this common opinion of his\r\ntime, Dunstan and his mission should be judged.\r\n\r\nDunstan was aided in his work by King Edgar the Pacific, who, by the\r\nway, was himself compelled to go without his crown seven years for\r\nviolating the chastity of a nun. Oswald, the Bishop of Worcester, and\r\nEthelwold, the Bishop of Winchester, were also zealously engaged in the\r\ntask of reform.\r\n\r\nA law was enacted providing that priests, deacons and sub-deacons should\r\nlive chastely or resign. As a result of this law, many priests were\r\nejected from the monasteries and from their official positions. Strict\r\nmonks were put in their places. A strong opposition party was created,\r\nand the ejected clergy aroused such discontent that a civil war was\r\nbarely averted. This state of things continued until the Norman\r\ninvasion, when the monks and secular clergy joined forces in the common\r\ndefence of their property and ecclesiastical rights.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that many writers, misled by legends for which Dunstan\r\nmust not be held responsible, and blinded by religious prejudice, have\r\nunjustly charged him with hypocrisy and even crime. All his methods may\r\nnot be defensible when estimated in the light of modern knowledge, and\r\neven his ideal may be rejected when judged by modern standards of\r\nChristian character, but he must be considered with the moral and\r\nintellectual life of his times in full view. He was a champion of the\r\noppressed, a friend of the poor, an unflinching foe of sinful men in the\r\npulpit or on the throne. His will was inflexible, his independence noble\r\nand his energy untiring. In trying to bring the Anglo-Saxon church into\r\nconformity to Rome he was actuated by a higher motive than the merely\r\nselfish desire for ecclesiastical authority. He regarded this harmony as\r\nthe only remedy for the prevailing disorders. He believed, like many\r\nother churchmen of unquestioned purity and honesty, that it was\r\nnecessary to compel temporal authorities to recognize the power of the\r\nchurch in order to overcome that defiance of moral law which was the\r\nchief characteristic of the kings and princes in that turbulent period.\r\n\r\nWhat the Anglo-Saxon church might have been if the rule of celibacy had\r\nnot been forced upon her, and if she had not submitted to Roman\r\nauthority in other matters, is a theme for speculation only. The fact\r\nis that Dunstan found a church corrupt to the core and left it, as a\r\nresult of his purifying efforts, with some semblance, to say the least,\r\nof moral influence and spiritual purity. Some other kind of\r\necclesiastical polity than that advocated by Dunstan might have achieved\r\nthe same results as his, but the simple fact is that none did. In so far\r\nas Dunstan succeeded in his monastic measures, he laid the foundations\r\nof an ecclesiastical power which afterwards became a serious menace to\r\nthe political freedom of the Anglo-Saxon race. The battle begun by him\r\nraged fiercely between the popes, efficiently supported by the monks,\r\nand the kings of England, with varying fortunes, for many centuries. But\r\nperhaps, under the plans of that benign Providence who presides over the\r\ndestiny of nations, it was essentially in the interests of civilization,\r\nthat the lawlessness of rulers and the vices of the people should be\r\nrestrained by that ecclesiastical power, which, in after years, and at\r\nthe proper time, should be forced to recede to its legitimate sphere and\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated reformatory movement was begun by St. Bruno, who\r\nfounded the Carthusian Order about the year 1086. Ruskin says: \"In\r\ntheir strength, from the foundation of the order at the close of the\r\neleventh century to the beginning of the fourteenth, they reared in\r\ntheir mountain fastnesses and sent out to minister to the world a\r\nsuccession of men of immense mental grasp and serenely authoritative\r\ninnocence, among whom our own Hugh of Lincoln, in his relations with\r\nHenry II. and Coeur de Lion, is to my mind the most beautiful sacerdotal\r\nfigure known to me in history.\"\r\n\r\nBruno, with six companions, established the famous Grand Chartreuse in a\r\nrocky wilderness, near Grenoble, in France, separated from the rest of\r\nthe world by a chain of wild mountains, which are covered with ice and\r\nsnow for two-thirds of the year.\r\n\r\nUntil the time of Guigo (1137), the Grand Chartreuse was governed by\r\nunwritten rules. Thirteen monks only were permitted to live together,\r\nand sixteen converts in the huts at the foot of the hill. The policy of\r\nthis monastery was at first opposed to all connection with other\r\nmonasteries. But applications for admission were so numerous that\r\ncolonies were sent out in various directions, all subject to the mother\r\nhouse. The Carthusians differed in many respects from other orders. The\r\nrules of Dom Guigo indicate that the chief aim was to preclude the monks\r\nfrom intercourse with the world, and largely with each other, for each\r\nmonk had separate apartments, cooked his own food, and so rarely met\r\nwith his brethren, that he was practically a hermit. The clothing\r\nconsisted of a rough hair shirt, worn next the skin, a white cassock\r\nover it, and, when they went out, a black robe. Fasting was observed at\r\nleast three days a week, and meat was strictly forbidden. Respecting\r\ncontact with women Dom Guigo says: \"Under no circumstances whatever do\r\nwe allow women to set foot within our precincts, knowing as we do that\r\nneither wise man, nor prophet, nor judge, nor the entertainer of God,\r\nnor the sons of God, nor the first created of mankind, fashioned by\r\nGod's own hands, could escape the wiles and deceits of women.\"\r\n\r\nBlistering and bleeding, as well as fasting, were employed to control\r\nevil impulses. On the whole, the austerities were as severe as human\r\nnature in that wild and cold region could endure. Yet the prosperity\r\nthat rewarded the piety and labors of the Carthusian monks proved more\r\nthan a match for their rigorous discipline, and in the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century we read charges of laxity and disorder.\r\n\r\nThe Carthusians settled in England in the twelfth century, and had a\r\nfamous monastery in London, since called the Charterhouse. The order was\r\nin many respects the most successful attempt at reform, but as has been\r\nsaid, \"the whole order, and each individual member, is like a\r\npetrifaction from the Middle Ages.\" Owing to its extremely solitary\r\nideal and its severe discipline, it was unfitted to secure extensive\r\ncontrol, or to gain a permanent influence upon the rapidly-developing\r\nEuropean nations. Its chief contributions to modern civilization were\r\nmade by the gift of noble men who passed from the seclusion of the cell\r\ninto the active life of the world, thus practically proving that the\r\nmonks' greatest usefulness was attained when loyalty to their vows\r\nyielded to a broader ideal of Christian character and service.\r\n\r\nThus the months passed into years and the years into centuries. Man was\r\nslowly working out his salvation. Painfully, laboriously he emerged out\r\nof barbarism into the lower forms of civilization; wearily he trudged\r\non his way toward the universal kingdom of righteousness and peace.\r\n\r\nThere were many other attempts at reform which may not even be\r\nmentioned, but one character deserves brief consideration,--Bernard of\r\nClairvaux,--the fairest flower of those corrupt days. The order to which\r\nhe belonged was the Cistercians, so named because their mother house was\r\nat Citeaux (Latin, _Cistercium_), in France. Its members are sometimes\r\ncalled the \"White Monks,\" because of their white tunics. Their\r\nbuildings, with their bare walls and low rafters, were a rebuke to the\r\nsplendid edifices of the richer orders. Austere simplicity characterized\r\ntheir churches, liturgy and habits. Gorgeousness in decoration and\r\nostentation in public services were carefully avoided. They used no\r\npictures, stained glass or images. Once a week they flogged their sinful\r\nbodies. Only four hours' sleep was allowed. Seeking out the wildest\r\nspots and most rugged peaks they built their retreats, beautiful in\r\ntheir simplicity and furnishing some of the finest examples of monastic\r\narchitecture. The order spread into England, where the first\r\nCistercians were characterized by devoutness and poverty. After a while\r\nthe hand of fate wrote of them as it had of so many, \"none were more\r\ngreedy in adding farm to farm; none less scrupulous in obtaining grants\r\nof land from wealthy patrons.\" In general, the order was no better and\r\nno worse than the rest, but its chief glory is derived from the luster\r\nthat was shed upon it by Bernard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAINT BERNARD]\r\n\r\nThis illustrious counselor of kings and Catholic saint was born in\r\nBurgundy in 1091. When about twenty years of age he entered the\r\nmonastery at Citeaux with five of his brothers. His genius might have\r\nsecured ecclesiastical preferment, but he chose to dig ditches, plant\r\nfields and govern a monastery. He entered the cloister at Citeaux\r\nbecause the monks were few and poor, and when it became crowded because\r\nof his fame, and its rule became lax because of the crowds, he left the\r\ncloister to found a home of his own. The abbot selected twelve monks,\r\nfollowing the number of apostles, and at their head placed young\r\nBernard. He led the twelve to the valley of Wormwood, and there, in a\r\ncheerless forest, he established the monastery of Clairvaux, or Clear\r\nValley. His rule was fiercely severe because he himself loved hardships\r\nand rough fare. \"It in no way befits religion,\" he writes, \"to seek\r\nremedies for the body, nor is it good for health either. You may now and\r\nthen take some cheap herb,--such as poor men may,--and this is done\r\nsometimes. But to buy drugs, to hunt up doctors, to take doses, is\r\nunbecoming to religion and hostile to purity.\" His success in winning\r\nmen to the monastic life was almost phenomenal. It was said that\r\n\"mothers hid their sons, wives their husbands, and companions their\r\nfriends, lest they be persuaded by his eloquent message to enter the\r\ncloister.\" \"He was avoided like a plague,\" says one.\r\n\r\nBernard's monks changed the whole face of the country by felling trees\r\nand tilling the ground. Their spiritual power rid the valley of Wormwood\r\nof its robbers, and the district grew rich and prosperous. Thus Bernard\r\nbecame the most famous man of his time. He was the arbiter in papal\r\nelections, the judge in temporal quarrels, the healer of schisms and a\r\npowerful preacher of the crusades. He was the embodiment of all that was\r\nbest in the thought of his age. His weaknesses and faults may largely be\r\nexplained by the fact that no man can rise entirely above the spirit of\r\nhis times and absolutely free himself from all pernicious tendencies.\r\n\"As an advocate for the rights of the church, for the immunities of the\r\nclergy, no less than for the great interests of morality, he was fierce,\r\nintractable, unforgiving, haughty and tyrannical.\" There was, however,\r\nno note of insincerity in his work or writings, and no tinge of\r\nhypocrisy in fervent zeal. He was brave, honest and pure; controlled\r\nalways by a consuming passion for the moral welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nOur chief interest in Bernard relates to his monastic work which shed\r\nundying luster on his name. Vaughan, in his \"Hours with the Mystics,\"\r\nsays of him: \"His incessant cry for Europe is, Better monasteries, and\r\nmore of them. Let these ecclesiastical castles multiply; let them cover\r\nand command the land, well garrisoned with men of God, and then, despite\r\nall heresy and schism, theocracy will flourish, the earth shall yield\r\nher increase, and all people praise the Lord.... Bernard had the\r\nsatisfaction of improving and extending monasticism to the utmost; of\r\nsewing together, with tolerable success, the rended vesture of the\r\npapacy; of suppressing a more popular and more scriptural Christianity\r\nfor the benefit of his despotic order; of quenching for a time, by the\r\nextinction of Abelard, the spirit of free inquiry, and of seeing his\r\nascetic and superhuman ideal of religion everywhere accepted as the\r\ngenuine type of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Dunstans, Brunos and Bernards, the monastic institution\r\nkeeps on crumbling. The edifice will not stand much more propping and\r\ntinkering. While we admire this display of moral force, this commendable\r\nstruggle of fresh courage and new hope against disintegrating forces,\r\nthe conviction gains ground that something is radically wrong with the\r\ninstitution. There is something in it which fosters greed and desperate\r\nambition. \"Is it not a shame,\" we feel compelled to ask, \"that so much\r\nsplendid, chivalrous courage and magnificent energy should be expended\r\nin trying to prevent a structure from falling, which, it seems, could\r\nnot possibly have been saved?\" But while the decay could not be stayed,\r\nwe must admire the noble aims and pious enthusiasm of the reformers who\r\nsought to preserve an institution which to them seemed the only hope of\r\na sinful world.\r\n\r\nDr. Storrs, in his life of Bernard, says: \"His soon-canonized name has\r\nshone starlike in history ever since he was buried; and it will not\r\nhereafter decline from its height or lose its luster, while men continue\r\nto recognize with honor the temper of devoted Christian consecration, a\r\ncharacter compact of noble forces, and infused with self-forgetful love\r\nfor God and man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Military Religious Orders_\r\n\r\nThe life of Bernard forms an appropriate introduction to a consideration\r\nof the Military Religious Orders. Although weary with labor and the\r\nweight of years, he traveled over Europe preaching the second crusade.\r\n\"To kill or to be killed for Christ's sake is alike righteous and alike\r\nsafe,\" this was his message to the world. In spite of the opposition of\r\ncourt advisers, Bernard induced Louis VII. and Conrad of Germany to take\r\nthe crusader's vow. He gave the Knights Templars a new rule and kindled\r\nafresh a zeal for the knighthood. Although the members of the Military\r\nOrders were not monks in the strict sense of the word, yet they were\r\nsoldier-monks, and as such deserve to be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nAt the basis of all monastic orders, as has been pointed out, were the\r\nthree vows of obedience, celibacy and poverty. Certain orders, by adding\r\nto these rules other obligations, or by laying special stress on one of\r\nthe three ancient vows, produced new and distinct types of monastic\r\ncharacter and life.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of the Hospital assumed as their peculiar work the care of\r\nthe sick. The Begging Friars, as will be seen later, were distinguished\r\nby the importance which they attached to the rule of poverty; the\r\nJesuits, by exalting the law of unquestioning obedience. In view of the\r\nwarlike character of the Middle Ages it is strange the soldier-monk did\r\nnot appear earlier than he did. The abbots, in many cases, were feudal\r\nlords with immense possessions which needed protection like secular\r\nproperty, but as this could not be secured by the arts of peace, we find\r\ntraces of the union of the soldier and the monk before the distinct\r\norders professing that character. The immediate cause of such\r\norganizations was the crusades. There were numerous societies of this\r\ncharacter, some of them so far removed from the monastic type as\r\nscarcely to be ranked with monastic institutions. One list mentions two\r\nhundred and seven of these Orders of Knighthood, comprising many\r\nvarieties in theory and practice. The most important were three,--the\r\nKnights of the Hospital, or the Knights of St. John; the Knights\r\nTemplars; and the Teutonic Knights. The Hospitallers wore black mantles\r\nwith white crosses, the Templars white mantles with red crosses, and the\r\nTeutonic Knights white mantles with black crosses. The mantles were in\r\nfact the robe of the monk adorned with a cross. The whole system was\r\nreally a marriage of monasticism and chivalry, as Gibbon says: \"The\r\nfirmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded in the Knights of the Hospital\r\nand of the Temple, that strange association of monastic and military\r\nlife. The flower of the nobility of Europe aspired to wear the cross and\r\nprofess the vows of these orders; their spirit and discipline were\r\nimmortal.\"\r\n\r\nA passage in the Alexiad quoted in Walter Scott's \"Robert of Paris\"\r\nreads: \"As for the multitude of those who advanced toward the great city\r\nlet it be enough to say, that they were as the stars in the heaven or\r\nas the sand of the seashore. They were in the words of Homer, as many as\r\nthe leaves and flowers of spring.\" This figurative description is almost\r\nliterally true. Europe poured her men and her wealth into the East. No\r\none but an eye-witness can conceive of the vast amount of suffering\r\nendured by those fanatical multitudes as they roamed the streets of\r\nJerusalem looking for shelter, or lay starving by the roadside on a\r\nbed of grass.\r\n\r\nThe term Hospitallers was applied to certain brotherhoods of monks and\r\nlaymen. While professing some monastic rule, the members of these\r\nsocieties devoted themselves solely to caring for the sick and the poor,\r\nthe hospitals in those days being connected with the monasteries.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1050 some Italian merchants secured permission to build a\r\nconvent in Jerusalem to shelter Latin pilgrims. The hotels which sprang\r\nup after this were gradually transformed into hospitals for the care of\r\nthe sick and presided over by Benedictine monks. The sick were carefully\r\nnursed and shelter granted to as many as could be accommodated. Nobles\r\nabandoned the profession of arms and, becoming monks, devoted\r\nthemselves to caring for the unfortunate crusaders in these inns. The\r\nwork rapidly increased in extent and importance. In the year 1099,\r\nGodfrey de Bouillon endowed the original hospital, which had been\r\ndedicated to St. John. He also established many other monasteries on\r\nthis holy soil. The monks, most of whom were also knights, formed an\r\norganization which received confirmation from Rome, as \"The Knights of\r\nSt. John of Jerusalem.\" The order rapidly assumed a distinctly military\r\ncharacter, for, to do its work completely, it must not only care for the\r\nsick in Jerusalem, but defend the pilgrim on his way to the Holy City.\r\nThis ended in an undertaking to defend Christendom against Mohammedan\r\ninvasion and in fighting for the recovery of the Holy Sepulcher.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting some of these Palestinian monasteries, a king of Hungary\r\nthus describes his impressions: \"Lodging in their houses, I have seen\r\nthem feed every day innumerable multitudes of poor, the sick laid on\r\ngood beds and treated with great care. In a word, the Knights of St.\r\nJohn are employed sometimes like Martha, in action, and sometimes like\r\nMary, in contemplation, and this noble militia consecrate their days\r\neither in their infirmaries or else in engagements against the enemies\r\nof the cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe Knights Templars were far more militant than the Knights of St.\r\nJohn, but they also were actuated by the monastic spirit. Bernard tried\r\nto inspire this order with a strong Christian zeal so that, as he said,\r\n\"War should become something of which God could approve.\" The success\r\nwhich attended its operations led as usual to its corruption and\r\ndecline. Beginning with a few crusaders leagued together for service and\r\nliving on the site of the ancient Temple at Jerusalem, it soon widened\r\nthe scope of its services and became a powerful branch of the crusading\r\narmy. It was charged by Philip IV. of France, in 1307, with the most\r\nfearful crimes, to sustain or to deny which accusations many volumes\r\nhave been composed. Five years later the order was suppressed and its\r\nvast accumulations transferred to the Knights of St. John. \"The horrible\r\nfate of the Templars,\" says Allen, \"was taken by many as a beginning and\r\nomen of the destruction that would soon pass upon all the hated\r\nreligious orders. And so this final burst of enthusiasm and splendor in\r\nthe religious life was among the prognostics of a state of things in\r\nwhich monasticism must fade quite away.\"\r\n\r\nWondrous changes have taken place in those dark and troubled years since\r\nBenedict began his labors at Monte Cassino, in 529. The monk has prayed\r\nalone in the mountains, and converted the barbarian in the forest. He\r\nhas preached the crusades in magnificent cathedrals, and crossed stormy\r\nseas in his frail bark. He has made the schools famous by his literary\r\nachievements, and taught children the alphabet in the woodland cell. He\r\nhas been good and bad, proud and humble, rich and poor, arrogant and\r\ngentle. He has met the shock of lances on his prancing steed, and\r\ntrudged barefoot from town to town. He has copied manuscripts in the\r\nlonely Scottish isle, and bathed the fevered brow of the pilgrim in the\r\nhospital at Jerusalem. He has dug ditches, and governed the world as the\r\npope of the Church. He has held the plow in the furrow, and thwarted the\r\ndevices of the king. He has befriended the poor, and imposed penance\r\nupon princes. He has imitated the poverty and purity of Jesus, and aped\r\nthe pomp and vice of kings. He has dwelt solitary on cold mountains,\r\nsubsisting on bread, roots and water, and he has surrounded himself with\r\nmenials ready to gratify every luxurious wish, amid the splendor of\r\npalatial cloisters. Still there are new types and phases of monasticism\r\nyet to appear. The monk has other tasks to undertake, for the world is\r\nnot yet sufficiently wearied of his presence to destroy his cloister and\r\nbanish him from the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n_THE MENDICANT FRIARS_\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln only applied a general principle to a specific case when\r\nhe said, \"This nation cannot long endure half slave and half free.\"\r\nGlaring inconsistencies between faith and practice will eventually\r\ndestroy any institution, however lofty its ideal or noble its\r\nfoundation. God suffers long and is kind, but His forbearance is not\r\nlimitless. Monasticism, as has been shown, was never free from serious\r\ninconsistency, from moral dualism. But the power of reform prolonged its\r\nexistence. It was constantly producing fresh models of its ancient\r\nideals. It had a hidden reserve-force from which it supplied shining\r\nexamples of a living faith and a self-denying love, just at the time\r\nwhen it seemed as if the system was about to perish forever. When these\r\nfresh exhibitions of monastic fidelity likewise became tarnished, when\r\nmen had tired of them and predicted the speedy collapse of the\r\ninstitution, forth from the cloister came another body of monkish\r\nrecruits, to convince the world that monasticism was not dead; that it\r\ndid not intend to die; that it was mightier than all its enemies. The\r\nday came, however, when the world lost its confidence in an institution\r\nwhich required such constant reforming to keep it pure, which demanded\r\nso much cleansing to keep it clean. Ideals that could so quickly lose\r\ntheir influence for good came to be looked upon with suspicion.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century we are confronted by the\r\nanomaly of a church grossly corrupt but widely obeyed. She is nearing\r\nthe pinnacle of her power and the zenith of her glory, although the\r\nparochial clergy have sunk into vice and incapacity, and the monks, as a\r\nclass, are lazy, ignorant and notoriously corrupt. Two things,\r\nespecially, command the attention,--first, the immorality and laxity of\r\nthe monks; and second, the growth of heresies and the tendency toward\r\nopen schism. The necessity of reform was clearly apprehended by the\r\nchurch as well as by the heretical parties, but, since the church had\r\nsuch a hold upon society, those who sought to reform the monasteries by\r\nreturning to old beliefs and ancient customs were much more in favor\r\nthan those who left the church and opposed her from the outside. The\r\nimpossibility of substantial, internal reform had not yet come to be\r\ngenerally recognized. As time passed the conviction that it was of no\r\nuse to attempt reforms from the inside gained ground; then the\r\nseparatists multiplied, and the shedding of blood commenced. The world\r\nhad to learn anew that it was futile to put new wine into old bottles or\r\nto patch new cloth on an old garment.\r\n\r\n\"It is the privilege of genius,\" says Trench, \"to evoke a new creation,\r\nwhere to common eyes all appears barren and worn out.\" Francis and\r\nDominic evoked this new creation; but although the monk now will appear\r\nin a new garb, he will prove himself to be about the same old character\r\nwhom the world has known a great many years; when this discovery is made\r\nmonasticism is doomed. Perplexed Europe will anxiously seek some means\r\nof destruction, but God will have Luther ready to aid in the solution of\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Francis Bernardone_, 1182-1226 _A.D._.\r\n\r\nSaint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order, was born at Assisi,\r\na walled town of Umbria, in Italy. His father, Peter Bernardone, or\r\nBernardo, was in France on business when his son was born and named. On\r\nhis return, or, as some say, at a later time, he changed his son's name\r\nfrom John to Francis. His wealth enabled him to supply Francis with the\r\nfunds necessary to maintain his leadership among gay companions.\r\nCatholic writers are fond of describing the early years of their saints\r\nas marked by vice in order to portray them as miracles of grace. It is\r\ntherefore uncertain whether Francis was anything worse than a happy,\r\njoyous lad, who loved fine clothes, midnight songs and parties of\r\npleasure. He was certainly a very popular and courteous lad, very much\r\nin love with the world. During a short service in the army he was taken\r\nprisoner. After his release he fell sick, and experienced a temporary\r\ndisgust with his past life. With his renewed health his love of\r\nfestivities and dress returned.\r\n\r\nWalking out one day, dressed in a handsome new suit, he met a poor and\r\nill-clad soldier; moved to pity, he exchanged his fine clothes for the\r\nrags of the stranger. That night Francis dreamed of a splendid castle,\r\nwith gorgeous banners flying from its ramparts, and suits of armor\r\nadorned with the cross. \"These,\" said a voice, \"are for you and for your\r\nsoldiers.\" We are told that this was intended to be taken spiritually\r\nand was prophetic of the Begging Friars, but Francis misunderstood the\r\ndream, taking it as a token of military achievements. The next day he\r\nset off mounted on a fine horse, saying as he left, \"I shall be a great\r\nprince.\" But his weak frame could not endure such rough usage and he was\r\ntaken sick at Spoleto. Again he dreamed. This time the vision revealed\r\nhis misinterpretation of the former message, and so, on his recovery, he\r\nreturned somewhat crestfallen to Assisi, where he gave his friends a\r\nfarewell feast. Thus at the threshold of his career we note two\r\nimportant facts,--disease and dreams. All through his life he had these\r\nfits of sickness, attended by dreams; and throughout his life he was\r\nguided by these visions. Neander remarks: \"It would be a matter of some\r\nimportance if we could be more exactly informed with regard to the\r\nnature of his disease and the way in which it affected his physical and\r\nmental constitution. Perhaps it might assist us to a more satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the eccentric vein in his life, that singular mixture of\r\nreligious enthusiasm bordering insanity; but we are left wholly in\r\nthe dark.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis now devoted himself to his father's business, but dreams and\r\nvisions continued to distress him. His spiritual fervor increased daily.\r\nHe grieved for the poor and gave himself to the care of the sick,\r\nespecially the lepers. During a visit to Rome he became so sad at the\r\nsight of desperate poverty that he impetuously flung his bag of gold\r\nupon the altar with such force as to startle the worshipers. He went out\r\nfrom the church, exchanged his clothes for a beggar's rags, and stood\r\nfor hours asking alms among a crowd of filthy beggars.\r\n\r\nBut though Francis longed to associate himself in some way with the\r\nlowest classes, he could obtain no certain light upon his duty. While\r\nprostrated before the crucifix, in the dilapidated church of St.\r\nDamian, in Assisi, he heard a voice saying, \"Francis, seest thou not\r\nthat my house is in ruins? Go and restore it for me.\" Again it is said\r\nthat this pointed to his great life-work of restoring spiritual power to\r\nthe church, but he again accepted the message in a literal sense.\r\nDelighted to receive a command so specific, the kneeling Francis\r\nfervently responded, \"With good will, Lord,\" and gladly entered upon the\r\ntask of repairing the church of St. Damian. \"Having fortified himself by\r\nthe sign of the cross,\" he took a horse and a valuable bundle of goods\r\nbelonging to his father and sold both at Falingo. Instead of turning the\r\nproceeds over to his father, Francis offered them to the priest of St.\r\nDamian, who, fearing the father's displeasure, refused to accept the\r\nstolen funds. The young zealot, \"who had utter contempt for money,\"\r\nthrew the gold on one of the windows of the church. Such is the story as\r\ngleaned from Catholic sources. The heretics, who have criticised Francis\r\nfor this conduct, are answered by the following ingenious but dangerous\r\nsophistry: \"It is certainly quite contrary to the ordinary law of\r\njustice for one man to take for himself the property of another; but if\r\nAlmighty God, to whom all things belong, and for whom we are only\r\nstewards, is pleased to dispense with this His own law in a particular\r\ncase, and to bestow what He has hitherto given to one upon another, He\r\nconfers at the same time a valid title to the gift, and it is no robbery\r\nin him who has received it to act upon that title.\"\r\n\r\nFearing his father's wrath, Francis hid himself in the priest's room,\r\nand contemporary authors assure us that when the irate parent entered,\r\nFrancis was miraculously let into the wall. Wading (1731 A.D.) says the\r\nhollow place may still be seen in the wall.\r\n\r\nAfter a month, the young hero, confident of his courage to face his\r\nfather, came forth pale and weak, only to be stoned as a madman by the\r\npeople. His father locked him up in the house, but the tenderer\r\ncompassion of his mother released him from his bonds, and he found\r\nrefuge with the priest. When his father demanded his return, Francis\r\ntore off his clothes and, as he flung the last rag at the feet of his\r\nastounded parent, he exclaimed: \"Peter Bernardone was my father; I have\r\nbut one father, He that is in Heaven.\" The crowd was deeply moved,\r\nespecially when they saw before them the hair shirt which Francis had\r\nsecretly worn under his garments. Gathering up all that was left to him\r\nof his son, the father sadly departed, leaving the young enthusiast to\r\nfight his own way through the world. Many times after that, the parents,\r\nwho tenderly watched over the lad in sickness and prayed for his\r\nrecovery, saw their beloved son leading his barefooted beggars through\r\nthe streets of his native town. But he will never more sing his gay\r\nsongs underneath their roof or sally forth with his merry companions in\r\nsearch of pleasure. Francis was given a laborer's cloak, upon which he\r\nmade the sign of a cross with some mortar, \"thus manifesting what he\r\nwished to be, a half-naked poor one, and a crucified man.\" Such was the\r\nsaint, in 1206, in his twenty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nFrancis now went forth, singing sacred songs, begging his food, and\r\nhelping the sick and the poor. He was employed \"in the vilest affairs of\r\nthe scullery\" in a neighboring monastery. At this time he clothed\r\nhimself in the monk's dress, a short tunic, a leathern girdle, shoes and\r\na staff. He waited upon lepers and kissed their disgusting ulcers. Yet\r\nmore, he instantly cured a dreadfully cancerous face by kissing it. He\r\nate the most revolting messes, reproaching himself for recoiling in\r\nnausea. Thus the pauper of Jesus Christ conquered his pride and\r\nluxurious tastes.\r\n\r\nFrancis finally returned to repair the church of St. Damian. The people\r\nderided, even stoned him, but he had learned to rejoice in abuse. They\r\ndid not know of what stern stuff their fellow-townsman was made. He bore\r\nall their insults meekly, and persevered in his work, carrying stones\r\nwith his own hands and promising the blessing of God on all who helped\r\nhim in his joyful task. His kindness and smiles melted hatred; derision\r\nturned to admiration. \"Many were moved to tears,\" says his biographers,\r\n\"while Francis worked on with cheerful simplicity, begging his\r\nmaterials, stone by stone, and singing psalms about the streets.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after his conversion, or in 1208, while kneeling in the church\r\nof Sta. Maria dei Angeli, he heard the words of Christ: \"Provide neither\r\ngold nor silver nor brass in your purses, neither two coats nor shoes\r\nnor staff, but go and preach.\" Afterwards, when the meaning of these\r\nwords was explained to him, he exclaimed: \"This is what I seek for!\" He\r\nthrew away his wallet, took off his shoes, and replaced his leather\r\ngirdle by a cord. His hermit's tunic appearing too delicate, he put on a\r\ncoarse, gray robe, reaching to his feet, with sleeves that came down\r\nover his fingers; to this he added a hood, covering his head and face.\r\nClothing of this character he wore to the end of his life. This was in\r\n1208, which is regarded as the first year of the Order of St. Francis.\r\nThe next year Francis gave this habit to those who had joined him.\r\n\r\nSo the first and chief of Franciscan friars, unattended by mortal\r\ncompanions, went humbly forth to proclaim the grandeur and goodness of a\r\nGod, who, according to monastic teaching, demands penance and poverty of\r\nhis creatures as the price of his highest favor and richest blessings.\r\nNearly seven hundred long years have passed since that eventful day, but\r\nthe begging Brothers of Francis still traverse those Italian highways\r\nover which the saint now journeyed with meek and joyous spirit.\r\n\r\n     \"He was not yet far distant from his rising\r\n     Before he had begun to make the earth\r\n     Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.\r\n     For he in youth his father's wrath incurred\r\n     For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,\r\n     The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;\r\n     And was before his spiritual court\r\n     _Et coram patre_ unto her united;\r\n     Then day by day more fervently he loved her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     But that too darkly I may not proceed,\r\n     Francis and Poverty for these two lovers\r\n     Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Dante_.\r\n\r\nIn 1210, with eleven companions, his entire band, Francis went to Rome\r\nto secure papal sanction. Pope Innocent III. was walking in a garden of\r\nthe Lateran Palace when a beggar, dusty and pale, confronted him.\r\nProvoked at being disturbed in his thoughts, he drove him away. That\r\nnight it was the pope's turn to dream. He saw a falling church supported\r\nby a poor and miserable man. Of course, that man was Francis. Four or\r\nfive years later the pope will dream the same thing again. Then the poor\r\nman will be Dominic. In the morning he sent for the monk whom he had\r\ndriven from him as a madman the day before. Standing before his holiness\r\nand the college of cardinals, Francis pleaded his cause in a touching\r\nand eloquent parable. His quiet, earnest manner and clear blue eyes\r\nimpressed every one. The pope did not give him formal sanction\r\nhowever--this was left for Honorius III., November 29, 1223--but he\r\nverbally permitted him to establish his order and to continue his\r\npreaching.\r\n\r\nSeveral times Francis set out to preach to the Mohammedans, but failed\r\nto reach his destination. He finally visited Egypt during the siege of\r\nDamietta, and at the risk of his life he went forth to preach to the\r\nsultan encamped on the Nile. He is described by an eye-witness \"as an\r\nignorant and simple man, beloved of God and men.\" His courage and\r\npersonal magnetism won the Mohammedan's sympathy but not his soul.\r\nAlthough Francis courted martyrdom, and offered to walk through fire to\r\nprove the truth of his message, the Oriental took it all too\r\ngood-naturedly to put him to the test, and dismissed him with kindness.\r\n\r\nFrancis was a great lover of birds. The swallows he called his sisters.\r\nA bird in the cage excited his deepest sympathy. It is said he sometimes\r\npreached to the feathered songsters. Longfellow has cast one of these\r\nhomilies into poetic form:\r\n\r\n     \"O brother birds, St. Francis said,\r\n     Ye come to me and ask for bread,\r\n     But not with bread alone to-day\r\n     Shall ye be fed and sent away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Oh, doubly are ye bound to praise\r\n     The great Creator in your lays;\r\n     He giveth you your plumes of down,\r\n     Your crimson hoods, your cloaks of brown.\r\n\r\n     He giveth you your wings to fly\r\n     And breathe a purer air on high,\r\n     And careth for you everywhere,\r\n     Who for yourselves so little care.\"\r\n\r\nLike all ascetics, Francis was tempted in visions. One cold night he\r\nfancied he was in a home of his own, with his wife and children around\r\nhim. Rushing out of his cell he heaped up seven hills of snow to\r\nrepresent a wife, four sons and daughters, and two servants. \"Make\r\nhaste,\" he cried, \"provide clothing for them lest they perish with the\r\ncold,\" and falling upon the imaginary group, he dispelled the vision of\r\ndomestic bliss in the cold embrace of the winter's snow. Mrs. Oliphant\r\npoints out the fact that, unlike most of the hermits and monks, Francis\r\ndreams not of dancing girls, but of the pure love of a wife and the\r\nmodest joys of a home and children. She beautifully says: \"Had he, for\r\none sweet, miserable moment, gone back to some old imagination and seen\r\nthe unborn faces shine beside the never-lighted fire? But Francis does\r\nnot say a word of any such trial going on in his heart. He dissipates\r\nthe dream by the chill touch of the snow, by still nature hushing the\r\nfiery thoughts, by sudden action, so violent as to stir the blood in his\r\nveins; and then the curtain of prayer and silence falls over him, and\r\nthe convent walls close black around.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of the saint on Mount Alverno deserves special\r\nconsideration, not merely on account of its singularity, but also\r\nbecause it affords a striking illustration of the difficulties one\r\nencounters in trying to get at the truth in monastic narratives. Francis\r\nhad retired to Mount Alverno, a wild and rugged solitude, to meditate\r\nupon the Lord's passion. For days he had been almost distracted with\r\ngrief and holy sympathy. Suddenly a seraph with six wings stood before\r\nhim. When the heavenly being departed, the marks of the Crucified One\r\nappeared upon the saint's body. St. Bonaventure says: \"His feet and\r\nhands were seen to be perforated by nails in their middle; the heads of\r\nthe nails, round and black, were on the inside of the hands, and on the\r\nupper parts of the feet; the points, which were rather long, and which\r\ncame out on the opposite sides, were turned and raised above the flesh,\r\nfrom which they came out.\" There also appeared on his right side a red\r\nwound, which often oozed a sacred blood that stained his tunic.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable story has provoked considerable discussion. One's\r\nconclusions respecting its credibility will quite likely be determined\r\nby his general view of numerous similar narratives, and by the degree of\r\nhis confidence in the value of human testimony touching such matters.\r\nThe incongruities and palpable impostures that seriously impair the\r\ngeneral reliability of monkish historians render it difficult to\r\ndistinguish between the truths and errors in their writings.\r\n\r\nSome authorities hold that the marks did not appear on St. Francis, and\r\nthat the story is without foundation. But Roman writers bring forward\r\nthe three early biographers of Francis who claim that the marks did\r\nappear. Pope Alexander IV. publicly averred that he saw the wounds, and\r\npronounced it heresy to doubt the report. Popes Benedict XI., Sixtus\r\nIV., and Sixtus V. consecrated and canonized the impressions by\r\ninstituting a particular festival in their honor. Numerous persons are\r\nsaid to have seen the marks and to have kissed the nails, after the\r\ndeath of the saint. Singularly enough, the Dominicans were inclined to\r\nregard the story as a piece of imposture designed to exalt Francis\r\nabove Dominic.\r\n\r\nBut, if it be admitted that the marks did appear, as it is not\r\nimprobable, how shall the phenomenon be explained? At least four\r\ntheories are held: 1. Fraud; 2. The irresponsible self-infliction of the\r\nwounds; 3. Physical effects due to mental suggestion or some other\r\npsychic cause; 4. Miracle.\r\n\r\n1. The temptation is strong to claim a fraud, especially because the\r\nsame witnesses who testify to the truth of the tale, also relate such\r\nmonstrous, incredible stories, that one is almost forced to doubt\r\neither their integrity or their sanity. But there is no evidence in\r\nsupport of so serious an indictment. After showing that signs and\r\nportents attend every crisis in history, Mrs. Oliphant says: \"Every\r\ngreat spiritual awakening has been accompanied by phenomena quite\r\nincomprehensible, which none but the vulgar mind can attribute to\r\ntrickery and imposture;\" but still she herself remains in doubt about\r\nthe whole story.\r\n\r\n2. Although Mosheim uses the term \"fraud,\" it would seem that he means\r\nrather the irresponsible self-infliction of the wounds. He says: \"As he\r\n[Francis] was a most superstitious and fanatical mortal, it is\r\nundoubtedly evident that he imprinted on himself the holy wounds. Paul's\r\nwords, 'I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus,' may have\r\nsuggested the idea of the fraud.\" The notion certainly prevailed that\r\nFrancis was a sort of second Christ, and a book was circulated showing\r\nhow he might be compared to Christ in forty particulars. There are many\r\nthings in his biography which, if true, indicate that Francis yearned to\r\nimitate literally the experiences of his Lord.\r\n\r\n3. Numerous experiments, conducted by scientific men, have established\r\nthe fact that red marks, swellings, blisters, bleeding and wounds have\r\nbeen produced by mental suggestion. Björnstrom, in his work on\r\n\"Hypnotism,\" after recounting various experiments showing the effect of\r\nthe imagination on the body, says, respecting the _stigmata_ of the\r\nMiddle Ages: \"Such marks can be produced by hypnotism without deceit and\r\nwithout the miracles of the higher powers.\" Prof. Fisher declares:\r\n\"There is no room for the suspicion of deceit. The idea of a strange\r\nphysical effect of an abnormal state is more plausible.\" Trench thinks\r\nthis is a reasonable view in the case of a man like Francis, \"with a\r\ntemperament so irrepressible, of an organization so delicate, permeated\r\nthrough and through with the anguish of the Lord's sufferings,\r\npassionately and continually dwelling on the one circumstance of his\r\ncrucifixion.\" But others, despairing of any rational solution, cut the\r\nGordian knot and declare that \"the kindest thing to think about Francis\r\nis that he was crazy.\"\r\n\r\n4. Roman Catholics naturally reject all explanations that exclude the\r\nsupernatural, for, as Father Candide Chalippe affirms: \"Catholics ought\r\nto be cautious in adopting anything coming from heretics; their opinions\r\nare almost always contagious.\" He therefore holds fast to the miracles\r\nin the lives of the saints, not only because he accepts the evidence,\r\nbut because he believes these wonderful stories \"add great resplendency\r\nto the merits of the saints, and, consequently, give great weight to the\r\nexample they afford us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is altogether probable that each one will continue to view the whole\r\naffair as his predispositions and religious convictions direct; some\r\nunconvinced by traditionary evidence and undismayed by charges of\r\nheresy; others devoutly accepting every monkish miracle and marveling at\r\nthe obstinacy of unbelief.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the event just described Francis was carried on a cot\r\noutside the walls of Assisi, where, lifting his hands he blessed his\r\nnative city. Some few days later, on October 4, 1226, he passed away,\r\nexclaiming, \"Welcome, Sister Death!\"\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of the legends that cluster about his life,\r\nFrancis himself must not be held responsible for all that has been\r\nwritten about him. He himself was no phantom or mythical being, but a\r\nreal, earnest man who, according to his light, tried to serve his\r\ngeneration. As he himself said: \"A man is just so much and no more as he\r\nis in the sight of God.\" \"Francis appears to me,\" says Forsyth, \"a\r\ngenuine, original hero, independent, magnanimous, incorruptible. His\r\npowers seemed designed to regenerate society; but taking a wrong\r\ndirection, they sank men into beggars.\" Through the mist of tradition\r\nthe holy beggar and saintly hero shines forth as a loving, gentle soul,\r\nunkind to none but himself. However his biography may be regarded, his\r\nlife illustrates the beauty and power of voluntary renunciation,--the\r\nfountain not only of religion but of all true nobility of character. He\r\nmay have been ignorant, perhaps grossly so, as Mosheim thinks, but\r\nnevertheless he merits our highest praise for striving honestly to keep\r\nhis vow of poverty in the days when worldly monks disgraced their sacred\r\nprofession by greed, ambition, and lustful indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Franciscan Orders_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orders which Francis founded were of three classes:\r\n\r\n1. Franciscan Friars or Order of Friars Minor, called also Gray or\r\nBegging Friars. The year in which Francis took the habit, 1208, is\r\nreckoned the first year of the order, but the Rule was not given\r\nuntil 1210.\r\n\r\nThis Rule, which has not been preserved, was very simple, and doubtless\r\nconsisted of a group of gospel passages, bearing on the vow of poverty,\r\ntogether with a few precepts about the occupations of the brethren. The\r\npope was not asked to sanction the Rule but only to give his approbation\r\nto the missions of the little band. Some of the cardinals expressed\r\ntheir doubts about the mode of life provided for in the rules. \"But,\"\r\nreplied Giovanni di San Paolo, \"if we hold that to observe gospel\r\nperfection and make profession of it is an irrational and impossible\r\ninnovation, are we not convicted of blasphemy against Christ, the Author\r\nof the Gospel?\"\r\n\r\nThere was also the Rule of 1221, which makes an intermediate stage\r\nbetween the first Rule and that which was approved by the pope November\r\n29, 1223. The Rule of 1210 was thoroughly Franciscan. It was the\r\nexpression of the passionate, fervent soul of Francis. It was the cry of\r\nthe human heart for God and purity. The Rule of 1223 shows that the\r\nchurch had begun to direct the movement. Sabatier says of these two\r\nrules: \"At the bottom of it all is the antinome of law and love. Under\r\nthe reign of law we are the mercenaries of God, bound down to an irksome\r\ntask, but paid a hundred-fold, and with an indisputable right to our\r\nwages.\" Such was the conception underlying the Rule of 1223. That of\r\n1210 is thus described: \"Under the rule of love we are the sons of God,\r\nand co-workers with Him; we give ourselves to Him without bargaining and\r\nwithout expectation; we follow Jesus, not because this is well, but\r\nbecause we cannot do otherwise, because we feel that He has loved us and\r\nwe love Him in our turn.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis would not allow his monks to be called Friars; he preferred\r\nFriars Minor or Little Brothers as a more humble designation[F].\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Appendix, Note F.]\r\n\r\nTen years after the founding of the order, it is claimed, over five\r\nthousand friars assembled in Rome for the general chapter. The monks\r\nlodged in huts made of matting and hence this convention has been called\r\nthe \"Chapter of Mats.\" The order was strongest numerically about fifty\r\nyears after the death of Francis, when it numbered eight thousand\r\nconvents and two hundred thousand monks. Many of its members were highly\r\ndistinguished, such as St. Bonaventura, Duns Scotus, Roger Bacon and\r\nCardinal Ximenes.\r\n\r\n2. Nuns of St. Clara or Poor Claras, dates from 1212, but it did not\r\nreceive its rule from Francis until 1224. The order was founded in the\r\nfollowing manner: Clara, a daughter of a noble family, was distinguished\r\nfor her beauty and by her love for the poor. Francis often met her, and,\r\nin the language of his biographer, \"exhorted her to a contempt of the\r\nworld and poured into her ears the sweetness of Christ.\" Guided, no\r\ndoubt, by his counsel, she stole one night from her home to a\r\nneighboring church where Francis and his beggars were assembled. Her\r\nlong and beautiful hair was cut off, while a coarse woolen gown was\r\nsubstituted for her own rich garments. Standing in the midst of the\r\nragged monks, she renounced the dregs of Babylon and a wicked world,\r\npledging her future to the monastic institution. Out from this little\r\nchurch into the darkness of the night, Francis led this beautiful girl\r\nof seventeen years and committed her to a Benedictine nunnery. Later on\r\nClara became the abbess of a Franciscan convent at St. Damian, and the\r\nSisterhood of St. Clara was established. It was an order of sadness and\r\npenitential tears. It is said that Clara never but once (when she\r\nreceived the blessing of the pope) lifted her eyelids so that the color\r\nof her eyes might be discerned.\r\n\r\n3. The Third Order, called also \"Brotherhood of Penitence,\" was composed\r\nof lay men and women. So many husbands and wives were desirous of\r\nleaving their homes in order to enter the monastic state, that Francis,\r\nnot wishing to break up happy marriages, so it is said, was compelled to\r\ngive these enthusiasts some sort of a rule by which they might\r\ncompromise between their established life and the monastic career. This\r\nstate of things led to the formation, in 1221, of the Third Order of\r\nSt. Francis, or the Order of Tertiaries, in relation to the Friars Minor\r\nand the Poor Claras. Sabatier says this generally-accepted date is\r\nwrong; that it is impossible to fix any date, for that which came to be\r\nknown as the Third Order was born of the enthusiasm excited by the\r\npreaching of Francis soon after his return from Rome in 1210. Candidates\r\nfor admission into this order were required to make profession of all\r\nthe orthodox truths, special care being employed to guard against the\r\nintrusion of heretics. Days of fasting and abstinence were enjoined, and\r\nmembers were urged to avoid profanity, the theater, dancing and\r\nlaw-suits. The order met with astonishing success, cardinals, bishops,\r\nemperors, empresses, kings and queens, gladly enrolling themselves among\r\nthe followers of St. Francis.\r\n\r\n_Dominic de Guzman, 1170-1221 A.D._\r\n\r\nHalf-way between Osma and Aranda in Old Castile, Spain, is a little\r\nvillage known as \"the fortunate Calahorra.\" Here was the castle of the\r\nGuzmans, where Dominic was born. His family was of high rank and\r\ncharacter, a noble house of warriors, statesmen and saints. If we accept\r\nthe legends, his greatness was foreshadowed. Before his birth, his\r\nmother dreamed she saw her son under the figure of a black-and-white\r\ndog, with a torch in his mouth. \"A true dream,\" says Milman, \"for he\r\nwill scent out heresy and apply the torch to the faggots;\" but, as will\r\nbe seen later, this observation does not rest on undisputed evidence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAVURE--RINGLER CO\r\n\r\nSAINT DOMINIC\r\n\r\nFROM A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PAINTING PRESERVED IN HIS CELL IN THE CONVENT\r\nOF SANTA SABINA, AT ROME\r\n\r\nTRENTON: ALBERT BRANDT, PUBLISHER, 1900]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1191, when Spain was desolated by a terrible famine, Dominic\r\nwas just finishing his theological studies. He gave away his money and\r\nsold his clothes, his furniture and even his precious manuscripts, that\r\nhe might relieve distress. When his companions expressed astonishment\r\nthat he should sell his books, Dominic replied: \"Would you have me study\r\noff these dead skins, when men are dying of hunger?\" This noble\r\nutterance is cherished by his admirers as the first saying from his lips\r\nthat has passed to posterity.\r\n\r\nDominic was educated in the schools of Palencia, afterwards a\r\nuniversity, where he devoted six years to the arts and four to theology.\r\nIn 1194, when twenty-five years of age, Dominic became a canon regular,\r\nat Osma, under the rule of St. Augustine. Nine years after he\r\naccompanied his bishop, Don Diego, on an embassy for the king of\r\nCastile. When they crossed the Pyrenees they found themselves in an\r\natmosphere of heresy. The country was filled with preachers of strange\r\ndoctrines, who had little respect for Dominic, his bishop, or their\r\nRoman pontiff. The experiences of this journey inspired in Dominic a\r\ndesire to aid in the extermination of heresy. He was also deeply\r\nimpressed by an important and significant observation. Many of these\r\nheretical preachers were not ignorant fanatics, but well-trained and\r\ncultured men. Entire communities seemed to be possessed by a desire for\r\nknowledge and for righteousness. Dominic clearly perceived that only\r\npreachers of a high order, capable of advancing reasonable argument,\r\ncould overthrow the Albigensian heresy.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, in a few words, to tell the whole story of this\r\nAlbigensian movement. Undoubtedly the term stood for a variety of\r\ntheological opinions, all of which were in opposition to the teachings\r\nof Rome. \"From the very invectives of their enemies,\" says Hallam, \"and\r\nthe acts of the Inquisition, it is manifest that almost every shade of\r\nheterodoxy was found among these dissidents, till it vanished in a\r\nsimple protestation against the wealth and tyranny of the clergy.\" Many\r\nof the tenets of these enthusiasts were undoubtedly borrowed from the\r\nancient Manicheism, and would be pronounced heretical by every modern\r\nevangelical denomination. But associated with those holding such\r\ndoctrines were numerous reformers, whose chief offense consisted in\r\ntheir incipient Protestantism. However heretical any of these sects may\r\nhave been, it is impossible to make them out enemies to the social\r\norder, except as all opponents of established religious traditions\r\ncreate disturbance. \"What these bodies held in common,\" says Hardwick,\r\n\"and what made them equally the prey of the inquisitor, was their\r\nunwavering belief in the corruption of the medieval church, especially\r\nas governed by the Roman pontiffs.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1208 Dominic visited Languedoc a second time, and on his way he\r\nencountered the papal legates returning in pomp to Rome, foiled in their\r\nattempt to crush this growing schism. To them he administered his famous\r\nrebuke: \"It is not the display of power and pomp, cavalcades of\r\nretainers, and richly-houseled palfreys, or by gorgeous apparel, that\r\nthe heretics win proselytes; it is by zealous preaching, by apostolic\r\nhumility, by austerity, by seeming, it is true, but by seeming holiness.\r\nZeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real\r\nsanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth.\" It is extremely\r\nunfortunate for the reputation of Dominic that he ever departed from the\r\nspirit of these noble words, which so clearly state the conditions of\r\ntrue religious progress.\r\n\r\nDominic now gathered about him a few men of like spirit and began his\r\ntask of preaching down heresy. But \"the enticing words of man's wisdom\"\r\nfailed to win the Albigensians from what they believed to be the words\r\nof God. So, unmindful of his admonition to the papal legates, Dominic\r\nobtained permission of Innocent III. to hold courts, before which he\r\nmight summon all persons suspected of heresy. When eloquence and courts\r\nfailed, the pope let loose the \"dogs of war.\" Then followed twenty years\r\nof frightful carnage, during which hundreds of thousands of heretics\r\nwere slain, and many cities were laid waste by fire and sword. \"This was\r\nto punish a fanaticism,\" says Hallam, \"ten thousand times more innocent\r\nthan their own, and errors which, according to the worst imputations,\r\nleft the laws of humanity and the peace of social life unimpaired.\"\r\nPeace was concluded in 1229, but the persecution of heretics went on.\r\n\r\nWhat part Dominic personally had in these bloody proceedings is\r\nlitigated history. His admirers strive to rescue his memory from the\r\ncharge that he was \"a cruel and bloody man.\" It is argued that while the\r\npope and temporal princes carried on the sanguinary war against the\r\nheretics, Dominic confined himself to pleading with them in a spirit of\r\ntrue Christian love. He was a minister of mercy, not an avenging angel,\r\nsword in hand. It has to be conceded that the constant tradition of the\r\nDominican order that Dominic was the first Inquisitor, whether he bore\r\nthe title or not, rests upon good authority. But what was the nature of\r\nthe office as held by the saint? As far as Dominic was concerned, it is\r\nargued by his friends that the office \"was limited to the\r\n_reconciliation_ of heretics and had nothing to do with their\r\n_punishment_.\" It is also claimed that while Dominic did impose\r\npenances, in some cases public flagellation, no evidence can be produced\r\nshowing that he ever delivered one heretic to the flames. Those who were\r\nburned were condemned by secular courts, and on the ground that they\r\nwere not only heretics but enemies of the public peace and perpetrators\r\nof enormous crimes.\r\n\r\nBut while it may not be proved that Dominic himself passed the sentence\r\nof death or applied the torch to the faggots with his own hand, he is by\r\nno means absolved from all complicity in those frightful slaughters, or\r\nfrom all responsibility for the subsequent establishment of the Holy\r\nInquisition. The principles governing the Inquisition were practically\r\nthose upon which Dominic proceeded; the germs of the later atrocities\r\nare to be found in his aims and methods. By what a narrow margin does\r\nDominic escape the charge of cruelty when it is boasted \"that he\r\nresolutely insisted on no sentence being carried out until all means had\r\nbeen tried by which the conversion of a prisoner could be effected.\"\r\nAnother statement also contains an inkling of a significant fact,\r\nnamely, that secular judges and princes were constantly under the\r\ninfluence of the monks and other ecclesiastical persons, who incited\r\nthem to wage war, and to massacre, in the Albigensian war as in other\r\ncrusades against heresy. No word from Dominic can be produced indicating\r\nthat he remonstrated with the pope, or that he tried to stop the\r\ncrusade. In a few instances he seems to have interceded with the crazed\r\nsoldiery for the lives of women and children. But he did not oppose the\r\nbloody crusade itself. He was constantly either with the army or\r\nfollowing in its wake. He often sat on the bench at the trial of\r\ndissenters. He remained the life-long friend of Simon de Montfort, the\r\ncruel agent of the papacy, and he blessed the marriage of his sons and\r\nbaptized his daughter. Special courts for trying heretics were\r\nestablished, previous to the more complete organization of the\r\nInquisition, and in these he held a commission.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Office of the Inquisition was made a permanent tribunal by\r\nGregory IX., in 1233, twelve years after the death of Dominic, and\r\ncuriously enough, in the same year in which he was canonized. The\r\nCatholic Bollandists claim that although the _title_ of Inquisitor was\r\nof later date than Dominic, yet the _office_ was in existence, and that\r\nthe splendor of the Holy Inquisition owes its beginning to that saint.\r\nCertain it is that the administration of the Inquisition was mainly in\r\nthe hands of Dominican monks.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts, Professor Allen is justified in his\r\nconclusions respecting Dominic and his share in the persecution of\r\nheretics: \"Whatever his own sweet and heavenly spirit according to\r\nCatholic eulogists, his name is a synonym of bleak and intolerant\r\nfanaticism. It is fatally associated with the blackest horrors of the\r\ncrusade against the Albigenses, as well as with the infernal skill and\r\ndeadly machinery of the Inquisition.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1214, Dominic established himself, with six followers, in the house\r\nof Peter Cellani, a rich resident of Toulouse. Eleven years of active\r\nand public life had passed since the Subprior of Osma had forsaken the\r\nquietude of the monastery. He now resumed his life of retirement and\r\nsubjected himself and his companions to the monastic rules of prayer and\r\npenance. But the restless spirit of the man could not long remain\r\ncontent with the seclusion and inactivity of a monk's life. The scheme\r\nof establishing an order of Preaching Friars began to assume definite\r\nshape in his mind. He dreamed of seven stars enlightening the world,\r\nwhich represented himself and his six friends. The final result of his\r\ndeliberations was the organization of his order, and the appearance of\r\nDominic in the city of Rome, in 1215, to secure the approval of the\r\npope, Innocent III. Although some describe his reception as \"most\r\ncordial and flattering,\" yet it required supernatural interference to\r\ninduce the pope to grant even his approval of the new order. It was not\r\nformally confirmed until 1216 by Honorius III.\r\n\r\nDominic now made his headquarters at Rome, although he traveled\r\nextensively in the interests of his growing brotherhood of monks. He was\r\nmade Master of the Sacred Palace, an important official post, including\r\namong its functions the censorship of the press. It has ever since been\r\noccupied by members of the Dominican order.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life Dominic is said to have zealously practiced rigorous\r\nself-denial. He wore a hair shirt, and an iron chain around his loins,\r\nwhich he never laid aside, even in sleep. He abstained from meat and\r\nobserved stated fasts and periods of silence. He selected the worst\r\naccommodations and the meanest clothes, and never allowed himself the\r\nluxury of a bed. When traveling, he beguiled the journey with spiritual\r\ninstruction and prayers. As soon as he passed the limits of towns and\r\nvillages, he took off his shoes, and, however sharp the stones or\r\nthorns, he trudged on his way barefooted. Rain and other discomforts\r\nelicited from his lips nothing but praises to God.\r\n\r\nDeath came at the age of fifty-one and found him exhausted with the\r\nausterities and labors of his eventful career. He had reached the\r\nconvent of St. Nicholas, at Bologna, weary and sick with a fever. He\r\nrefused the repose of a bed and bade the monks lay him on some sacking\r\nstretched upon the ground. The brief time that remained to him was\r\nspent in exhorting his followers to have charity, to guard their\r\nhumility, and to make their treasure out of poverty. Lying in ashes upon\r\nthe floor he passed away at noon, on the sixth of August, 1221. He was\r\ncanonized by Gregory IX., in 1234.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dominican Orders_\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Order of the Preaching Friars has already been\r\ndescribed. It is not necessary to dwell upon the constitution of this\r\norder, because in all essential respects it was like that of the\r\nFranciscans. The order is ruled by a general and is divided into\r\nprovinces, governed by provincials. The head of each house is called a\r\nprior. Dominic adopted the rules laid down by St. Augustine, because the\r\npope ordered him to follow some one of the older monastic codes, but he\r\nalso added regulations of his own.\r\n\r\nSoon after the founding of the order, bands of monks were sent out to\r\nParis, to Rome, to Spain and to England, for the purpose of planting\r\ncolonies in the chief seats of learning. The order produced many\r\neminent scholars, some of whom were Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus,\r\nEchard, Tauler and Savonarola.\r\n\r\nAs among the Franciscans, there was also an Order of Nuns, founded in\r\n1206, and a Third Order, called the Militia of Jesus Christ, which was\r\norganized in 1218.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Success of the Mendicant Orders_\r\n\r\nIn 1215, Innocent III. being pope, the Lateran council passed the\r\nfollowing law: \"Whereas the excessive diversity of these [monastic]\r\ninstitutions begets confusion, no new foundations of this sort must be\r\nformed for the future; but whoever wishes to become a monk must attach\r\nhimself to some of the already existing rules.\" This same pope approved\r\nthe two Mendicant orders, urging them, it is true, to unite themselves\r\nto one of the older orders; but, nevertheless, they became distinct\r\norganizations, eclipsing all previous societies in their achievements.\r\nThe reason for this disregard of the Lateran decree is doubtless to be\r\nfound in the alarming condition of religious affairs at that time, and\r\nin the hope held out to Rome by the Mendicants, of reforming the\r\nmonasteries and crushing the heretics.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the numerous and varied efforts to reform the monastic\r\ninstitution and the danger to the church arising from the unwonted\r\nstress laid upon poverty by different schismatic religious societies,\r\nnecessitated the adoption of radical measures by the church to preserve\r\nits influence. At this juncture the Mendicant friars appeared. The\r\nconditions demanded a modification of the monastic principle which had\r\nhitherto exalted a life of retirement. Seclusion in the cloister was no\r\nlonger possible in the view of the remarkable changes in religious\r\nthought and practice.\r\n\r\nInnocent III. was wise enough to perceive the immediate utility of the\r\nnew societies based upon claims to extraordinary humility and poverty.\r\nThe Mendicant orders were, in themselves, not only a rebuke to the\r\nluxurious indolence and shameful laxity of the older orders, but when\r\nsanctioned by the church, the existence of the new societies attested\r\nRome's desire to maintain the highest and the purest standards of\r\nmonastic life. Hence, the Preaching Friars were permitted to reproach\r\nthe clergy and the monks for their vices and corruptions.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of such a band of missionaries,\" says John Stuart Mill,\r\n\"must have been great in rousing and feeding dormant devotional\r\nfeelings. They were not less influential in regulating those feelings,\r\nand turning into the established Catholic channels those vagaries of\r\nprivate enthusiasm which might well endanger the church, since they\r\nalready threatened society itself.\"\r\n\r\nTwo novel monastic features, therefore, now appear for the first time:\r\n1. The substitution of itineracy for the seclusion of the cloister; and\r\n2. The abolition of endowments.\r\n\r\n1. The older orders had their traveling missionaries, but the general\r\npractice was to remain shut up within the monastic walls. The Mendicants\r\nat the start had no particular abiding place, but were bound to travel\r\neverywhere, preaching and teaching. It was distinctly the mission of\r\nthese monks to visit the camps, the towns, cities and villages, the\r\nmarket places, the universities, the homes and the churches, to preach\r\nand to minister to the sick and the poor. They neither loved the\r\nseclusion of the cell nor sought it. Theirs to tramp the dusty roads,\r\nwith their capacious bags, begging and teaching. Only by this itinerant\r\nmethod could the people be reached and the preachers of heresy be\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\n2. One of the chief sources of strength in the heretical sects was the\r\njustness of their attack upon the Catholic monastic orders, whose\r\nimmense riches belied their vows of poverty. The heretics practiced\r\nausterities and adopted a simplicity of life that won the hearts of the\r\npeople, by reason of its contrast to the loose habits of the monks and\r\nclergy. Since it was impossible to reform the older orders, it became\r\nabsolutely essential to the success of the Mendicants that they should\r\nrigorously respect the neglected discipline. As the abuse of the vow of\r\npoverty was particularly common, the Mendicants naturally\r\nemphasized this vow.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that a begging monk was by no means unknown, yet now,\r\nfor the first time, was the practice of mendicity formally adopted by\r\nentire orders. Owing to the excessive multiplication of mendicant\r\nsocieties, Pope Gregory X., at a general council held at Lyons in 1272,\r\nattempted to check the growing evil. The number of Mendicant orders was\r\nconfined to four, viz., the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites\r\nand the Augustinians or Hermits of Augustine. The Council of Trent\r\nconfined mendicity to the Observantines and Capuchins, since the other\r\nsocieties had practically abandoned their original interpretation of\r\ntheir vow of poverty and had acquired permanent property.\r\n\r\nWhen Francis tried to enforce the rule of poverty, his rigor gave rise\r\nto most serious dissensions, which began in his own lifetime and ended\r\nafter his death in open schism. Some of his followers were not pleased\r\nwith his views on that subject. They resisted his extreme strictness,\r\nand after his death they continued to advocate the holding of property.\r\nThe popes tried to settle the quarrel, but ever and anon it broke out\r\nafresh with volcanic fierceness. They finally interpreted the rule of\r\npoverty to mean that the friars could not hold property in their own\r\nnames, but they might enjoy its use. Under this interpretation of the\r\nrule, the beggars soon became very rich. Matthew of Paris said: \"The\r\nfriars who have been founded hardly forty years have built even in the\r\npresent day in England residences as lofty as the palaces of our kings.\"\r\nBut the better element among the Franciscans refused to consent to such\r\na palpable evasion of the rule. A portion of this class separated\r\nthemselves from the Franciscans, rejected their authority, and formed a\r\nnew sect called the _Fratricelli_, or Little Brothers. It is very\r\nimportant to keep the history of this name clearly in mind, for it\r\nfrequently appears in the Reformation period and has been the cause of\r\nmuch misunderstanding. The word \"Fratricelli\" came to be a term of\r\nderision applied to any one affecting the dress or the habits of the\r\nmonks. When heretical sects arose, it was applied to them as a stigma,\r\nbut it was used first by a sect of rigid Franciscans who deserted their\r\norder, adopted this name as their own, and exulted in its use. The\r\nquarrel among the monks led to a variety of complications and is\r\nintricately interwoven with the political and religious history of the\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. \"These rebellious\r\nFranciscans,\" says Mosheim, \"though fanatical and superstitious in some\r\nrespects, deserve an eminent rank among those who prepared the way for\r\nthe Reformation in Europe, and who excited in the minds of the people a\r\njust aversion to Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mendicants were especially active in educational work. This is to be\r\nattributed to several causes. Unquestionably the general and increasing\r\ninterest in theological doctrines and the craving for knowledge affected\r\nthe monastic orders. Europe was just arousing from her medieval\r\nslumbers. The faint rays of the Reformation dawn were streaking the\r\nhorizon. The intellect as well as the conscience was touched by the\r\nSpirit of God. The revolt against moral iniquity was often accompanied\r\nby skepticism concerning the authority and dogmas of the church.\r\nQuestions were being asked that ignorant monks could not answer. Too\r\nlong had the church ignored these symptoms of the approach of a new\r\norder of things. The church was forced to meet the heretics on their own\r\nground, to offset the example of their simplicity and purity of life by\r\nexalting the neglected standards of self-denial, and to silence them, if\r\npossible, by exposing their errors. Then came the Franciscans, with\r\ntheir austere simplicity and their insistence upon poverty. Then also\r\nappeared the Dominicans, or as they were called, \"The Watch-dogs of the\r\nChurch,\" who not only barked the church awake, but tried to devour\r\nthe heretics.\r\n\r\nFrancis halted for some time before giving encouragement to educational\r\nenterprises. A life of devotion and prayer attracted him, because, as he\r\nsaid, \"Prayer purifies the affections, strengthens us in virtue, and\r\nunites us to the sovereign good.\" But, he went on, \"Preaching renders\r\nthe feet of the spiritual man dusty; it is an employment which\r\ndissipates and distracts, and which causes regular discipline to be\r\nrelaxed.\" After consulting Brother Sylvester and Sister Clara, he\r\ndecided to adopt their counsel and entered upon a ministry of preaching.\r\nThe example and success of the Dominicans probably inspired the\r\nFranciscans to give themselves more and more to intellectual work.\r\n\r\nBoth orders received appointments in all the leading universities, but\r\nthey did not gain this ascendency without a severe conflict. The regular\r\nprofessors and the clergy were jealous of them for various causes, and\r\nresisted them at every point. The quarrel between the Dominicans and the\r\nUniversity of Paris is the most famous of these struggles. It began in\r\n1228 and did not end until 1259. The Dominicans claimed the right to two\r\ntheological professorships. One had been taken from them, and a law was\r\npassed that no religious order should have what these friars demanded.\r\nThe Dominicans rebelled and the University passed sentences of\r\nexpulsion. Innocent IV., wishing to become master of Italy, sided with\r\nthe University, but the next month he was dead,--in answer to their\r\nprayers, said the Dominicans, but rumor hinted an even blacker cause.\r\nThe thirty-one years of the struggle dragged wearily on, disturbed by\r\npapal bulls, appeals, pamphlets and university slogans. At last\r\nAlexander IV., in 1255, decided that the Dominicans might have the\r\nsecond professorship and also any other they thought proper. The noise\r\nof conflict now grew louder and boded ill for the peace of the church.\r\nThe pulpits flashed forth fiery utterances. The monks were assailed in\r\nevery quarter. William of Amour published his essay on \"The Perils of\r\nthe Last Times,\" in which he claimed that the perilous times predicted\r\nby the Apostle Paul were now fulfilled by these begging friars. He\r\nexposed their iniquities and bitterly complained of their arrogance and\r\nvice. His book was burned and its author banished. Although meaning to\r\nbe a friend of Rome, he unconsciously contributed his share to the\r\ncoming reform. In 1259, Rome thundered so loud that all Europe was\r\nterrified and the University was awed into submission.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature in the history of their educational\r\nenterprises is the entrance of the Mendicants into England, where they\r\nacted a leading part in the educational and political history of the\r\ncountry. The Dominicans settled first at Oxford, in 1221. The\r\nFranciscans, after a short stay at Canterbury, went to Oxford in 1224.\r\nThe story of how the two Gray friars journeyed from Canterbury to Oxford\r\nruns as follows: \"These two forerunners of a famous brotherhood, being\r\nnot far from Oxford, lost their way and came to a farmhouse of the\r\nBenedictines. It was nearly night and raining. They gently knocked, and\r\nasked admittance for God's sake. The porter gazed on their patched robes\r\nand beggarly aspect and supposed them to be mimics or despised persons.\r\nThe prior, pleased with the tidings, invited them in. But instead of\r\nsportively performing, these two friars insisted, with sedate\r\ncountenances, that they were men of God. Whereat the Benedictines in\r\njealousy, and displeased to be cheated out of their expected fun, kicked\r\nand buffeted the two poor monks and turned them out of doors. One young\r\nmonk pitied them and smuggled them into a hay-loft where we trust they\r\nslept soundly and safe from the cold and rain.\" The two friars finally\r\nreached Oxford and were well received by their Dominican brothers. Such\r\nwas the simple beginning of a brilliant career that was profoundly to\r\naffect the course of English history. Both at Cambridge and Oxford the\r\nmonastic orders exercised a remarkable influence. Traces of their labors\r\nand power may still be seen in the names of the colleges, and in the\r\nreligious portions of the university discipline. They built fine\r\nedifices and manned their schools with the best teachers, so that they\r\nbecame great rivals of the regular colleges which did not have the funds\r\nnecessary to compete with these wealthy beggars. Another cause of their\r\nrapid progress was the exodus of students from Paris to England. During\r\nthe quarrel at Paris, Henry III. of England offered many inducements to\r\nthe students, who left for England in large numbers. Many of them were\r\nprejudiced in favor of the friars, and they naturally drifted to the\r\nmonastic college. The secular clergy charged the friars with inducing\r\nthe college students to enter the monasteries or to turn begging monks.\r\nThe pope, the king, and the parliament became involved in the struggle,\r\nwhich grew more bitter as the years passed. After a while Wyclif\r\nappeared, and when he began his mighty attack upon the friars the joy\r\nwith which the professors viewed the struggle can be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Decline of the Mendicants_\r\n\r\nThe Mendicant friars won their fame by faithful and earnest labors. Men\r\nadmired them because they identified themselves with the lowest of\r\nmankind and heroically devoted themselves to the poor and sick. These\r\n\"sturdy beggars,\" as Francis called his companions, were contrasted with\r\nthe lazy, rich, and, too often, licentious monks of the other orders.\r\nEverywhere the friars were received with veneration and joy. The people\r\nsought burial in their rags, believing that, clothed in the garments of\r\nthese holy beggars, they would enter paradise more speedily.\r\n\r\nInstead of seeking the seclusion of the convent to save his own soul,\r\nthe friar displayed remarkable zeal trying to save mankind. He became\r\nthe arbiter in the quarrels of princes, the prime mover in treaties\r\nbetween nations, and the indispensable counselor in political\r\ncomplications. The pope employed him as his authorized agent in the most\r\ndifficult matters touching the welfare of the church. His influence upon\r\nthe common people is thus described by the historian Green: \"The theory\r\nof government wrought out in the cell and lecture-room was carried over\r\nthe length and breadth of the land by the Mendicant brother begging his\r\nway from town to town, chatting with the farmer or housewife at the\r\ncottage door and setting up his portable pulpit in village green or\r\nmarket-place. The rudest countryman learned the tale of a king's\r\noppression or a patriot's hope as he listened to the rambling,\r\npassionate, humorous discourse of the beggar friar.\"\r\n\r\nBy these methods the Mendicants were enabled to render most efficient\r\nservice to their patrons at Rome in their efforts to establish their\r\ntemporal power. They were, in fact, before the Reformation, just what\r\nthe Jesuits afterwards became, \"the very soul of the hierarchy.\" Yes,\r\nthey were immensely, prodigiously successful. The popes hastened to do\r\nthem honor. Because the friars were such enthusiastic supporters of the\r\nchurch, the popes poured gold and privileges into their capacious\r\ncoffers. Thankful peasants threw in their mites and the admiring noble\r\nbestowed his estates.\r\n\r\nThe secular clergy, with envy and chagrin, awoke to the alarming fact\r\nthat the beggars had won the hearts of the people; their hatred was\r\nincreased by the fact that when the Roman pontiffs enriched these\r\nindefatigable toilers and valiant foes of heresy, they did so at the\r\nexpense of the bishops and clergy, which, perhaps, was robbing Paul to\r\npay Peter.\r\n\r\nBaluzii says: \"No religious order had the distribution of so many and\r\nsuch ample indulgences as the Franciscans. In place of fixed revenues,\r\nlucrative indulgences were placed in their hands.\" So ill-judged was the\r\ndistribution of these favors that discipline was overturned. Many\r\nchurchmen, feeling that their rights were being encroached upon,\r\ncomplained bitterly, and resolved on retaliation. It is just here that a\r\npotent cause of the Mendicant's fall is to be found. He helped to dig\r\nhis own grave.\r\n\r\nHaving elevated monasticism to the zenith of its power, the Mendicant\r\norders, like all the other monastic brotherhoods, entered upon their\r\nshameful decline. The unexampled prosperity, so inconsistent with the\r\noriginal intentions of the founders of the orders, was attended by\r\ncorruptions and excesses. The decrees of councils, the denunciations of\r\npopes and high ecclesiastical dignitaries, the satires of literature,\r\nthe testimony of chroniclers and the formation of reformatory orders,\r\nconstitute a body of irrefragable evidence proving that the lowest level\r\nof sensuality, superstition and ignorance had been reached. The monks\r\nand friars lost whatever vigor and piety they ever possessed.\r\n\r\nIt is again evident that a monk cannot serve God and mammon. Success\r\nruins him. Wealth and popular favor change his character. The people\r\nslowly realize the fact that the fat and lazy medieval monk is not dead,\r\nafter all, but has simply changed his name to that of Begging Friar. As\r\nAllen neatly observes: \"Their gray gown and knotted cord wrapped a\r\nspiritual pride and capacity of bigotry, fully equal to the rest.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, are the \"sturdy beggars\" of Francis, dwelling in palatial\r\nconvents, arrogant and proud, trampling their ideal into the dust. Thus\r\nit came to pass in accordance with the principle stated at the beginning\r\nof this chapter, that when the ideal became a cloak to cover up sham,\r\ndecay had set in, and ruin, even though delayed for years, was sure to\r\ncome. The poor, sad-faced, honest, faithful friar everybody praised,\r\nloved and reverenced. The insolent, contemptuous, rich monk all men\r\nloathed. So a change of character in the friar transformed the songs of\r\npraise into shouts of condemnation. Those golden rays from the morning\r\nsun of the Reformation are ascending toward the highest heaven, and\r\ndaybreak is near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_THE SOCIETY OF JESUS_\r\n\r\nIn many respects it would be perfectly proper to consider the Mendicant\r\norders as the last stage in the evolution of the monastic institution.\r\nAlthough the Jesuitical system rests upon the three vows of poverty,\r\ncelibacy and obedience, yet the ascetic principle is reduced to a\r\nminimum in that society. Father Thomas E. Sherman, the son of the famous\r\ngeneral, and a Jesuit of distinguished ability, has declared: \"We are\r\nnot, as some seem to think, a semi-military band of men, like the\r\nTemplars of the Middle Ages. We are not a monastic order, seeking\r\nhappiness in lonely withdrawal from our fellows. Our enemies within and\r\nwithout the church would like to make us monks, for then we would be\r\ncomparatively useless, since that is not our end or aim.... We are\r\nregulars in the army of Christ; that is, men vowed to poverty, chastity\r\nand obedience; we are a collegiate body with the right to teach granted\r\nby the Catholic church[G].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Appendix, Note G.]\r\n\r\nThe early religious orders were based upon the idea of retirement from\r\nthe world for the purpose of acquiring holiness. But as has already been\r\nshown, the constant tendency of the religious communities was toward\r\nparticipation in the world's affairs. This tendency became very marked\r\namong the friars, who traveled from place to place, and occupied\r\nimportant university positions, and it reaches its culmination in the\r\nSociety of Jesus. Retirement among the Jesuits is employed merely as a\r\npreparation for active life. Constant intercourse with society was\r\nprovided for in the constitution of the order. Bishop John J. Keane, a\r\nRoman Catholic authority, says: \"The clerks regular, instituted\r\nprincipally since the sixteenth century, were neither monks nor friars,\r\nbut priests living in common and busied with the work of the ministry.\r\nThe Society of Jesus is one of the orders of clerks regular.\"\r\n\r\nOther differences between the monastic communities and the Jesuits are\r\nto be observed. The Jesuit discards the monastic gown, and is decidedly\r\naverse to the old monastic asceticism, with its rigorous and painful\r\ntreatment of the body. While the older religious societies were\r\nessentially democratic in spirit and government, the monks sharing in\r\nthe control of the monastic property and participating in the election\r\nof superiors, the Jesuitical system is intensely monarchical, a\r\ndespotism pure and simple. In the older orders, the welfare of the\r\nindividual was jealously guarded and his sanctification was sought.\r\nAmong the Jesuits the individual is nothing, the corporate body\r\neverything. Admission to the monastic orders was encouraged and easily\r\nobtained. The novitiate of the Jesuits is long and difficult. Access to\r\nthe highest grades of the order is granted only to those who have served\r\nthe society many weary years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IGNATIUS DE LOYOLA\r\n\r\nAFTER GREATBACH'S ENGRAVING FROM THE WIERZ PRINT\r\n\r\nBENTON: ALBERT BRANDT, PUBLISHER, 1900]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of such variations from the old monastic type, the Society\r\nof Jesus would doubtless never have appeared, had not the way for its\r\nexistence been paved by previous monastic societies. Its aims and its\r\nmethods were the natural sequence of monastic history. They were merely\r\na development of past experiences, for the objects of the society were\r\npractically the objects of the Mendicants; the vows were the same with a\r\nchange of emphasis. The abandonment of austerities as a means of\r\nsalvation or spiritual power was the natural fruit of past experiments\r\nthat had proved the uselessness of asceticism merely for the sake of\r\nacquiring a spirit of self-denial. The extirpation of heresy undertaken\r\nby Ignatius had already been attempted by the friars, while the\r\neducation of the young had long been carried on with considerable\r\nsuccess by the Benedictine and Dominican monks. The spirit of its\r\nfounder, however, gave the Society of Jesus a unique character, and\r\nmonasticism now passed out from the cell forever. The Jesuit may fairly\r\nbe regarded as a monk, unlike any of his predecessors but nevertheless\r\nthe legitimate fruit of centuries of monastic experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ignatius de Loyola, 1491-1556 A.D._\r\n\r\nInigo Lopez de Recalde, or Loyola, as he is commonly known, was born at\r\nGuipuzcoa, in Spain, in 1491. He was educated as a page in the court of\r\nFerdinand the Catholic. He afterwards became a soldier and led a very\r\nwild life until his twenty-ninth year. During the siege of Pamplona, in\r\n1521, he was severely wounded, and while convalescing he was given lives\r\nof Christ and of the saints to read. His perusal of these stories of\r\nspiritual combat inspired a determination to imitate the glorious\r\nachievements of the saints. For a while the thirst for military renown\r\nand an attraction toward a lady of the court, restrained his spiritual\r\nimpulses. But overcoming these obstacles, he resolutely entered upon his\r\nnew career.\r\n\r\nSometime after he visited the sanctuary of Montserrat, where he hung his\r\nshield and sword upon the altar of the Virgin Mary and gave his oath of\r\nfealty to the service of God. A tablet, erected by the abbot of the\r\nmonastery in commemoration of this event, reads as follows: \"Here,\r\nblessed Ignatius of Loyola, with many prayers and tears, devoted himself\r\nto God and the Virgin. Here, as with spiritual arms, he fortified\r\nhimself in sackcloth, and spent the vigil of the night. Hence he went\r\nforth to found the Society of Jesus, in the year MDXXII.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spending ten months in Manresa, Loyola went on a pilgrimage to the\r\nHoly Land, intending to remain there, but he was sent home by the\r\nEastern monks, and reached Italy in 1524.\r\n\r\nNow began his struggle for an education. At the age of thirty-three he\r\ntook his seat on the school-bench at Barcelona. In 1526 he entered the\r\nUniversity at Alcala. He was here looked upon as a dangerous innovator,\r\nand was imprisoned six weeks, by order of the Inquisition, for preaching\r\nwithout authority, since he was not in holy orders. After his release he\r\nattended the University of Salamanca, but he finally took his degree of\r\nMaster of Arts at the University of Paris, in 1533.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he was several times imprisoned as a dangerous\r\nfanatic, but each time he succeeded in securing a verdict in his favor.\r\nThe hostility to Ignatius and his work forms a strange parallel to the\r\nbitter antagonism which his society has always encountered.\r\n\r\nNine men, among whom was Francis Xavier, afterwards widely renowned, had\r\nbeen chosen with great care, as the companions of Ignatius. He called\r\nthem together in July, 1534, and on August 15th of the same year he\r\nselected six of them and bade them follow him to the Church of the\r\nBlessed Virgin, at Montmartre, in Paris. There and then they bound\r\nthemselves to renounce all their goods, and to make a voyage to\r\nJerusalem, in order to convert the Eastern infidels; if that scheme\r\nproved impracticable, they agreed to offer themselves to the sovereign\r\npontiff for any service he might require of them. War prevented the\r\njourney to the Holy Land, and so, after passing through a variety of\r\nexperiences, Ignatius and his companions met at Rome, to secure the\r\nsanction of Pope Paul III. for the new society. After a year and a half\r\nof deliberation and discussion a favorable decision was reached, which\r\nwas, no doubt, partly facilitated by the growth of the Reformation. The\r\nnew society was chartered on September 27, 1540, for the \"defence and\r\nadvance of the faith.\"\r\n\r\nIgnatius was elected as the general of the order and entered upon his\r\nduties, April 17, 1541. He soon prepared a constitution which was not\r\nadopted until after his death, and then in an amended form. Loyola ended\r\nhis remarkable and stormy career, July 31, 1556.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constitution and Polity of the Order_\r\n\r\nThe _Institutum_, which contains the governing laws of the society, is a\r\ncomplex document consisting of papal bulls and decrees, a list of the\r\nprivileges which have been granted to the order, ten chapters of rules,\r\ndecrees of the general congregations, the plan of studies (_ratio\r\nstudiorum_), and three ascetic writings, of which the Spiritual\r\nExercises of Ignatius constitute the chief part.\r\n\r\nThe society is distributed into six grades: novices, scholastics,\r\ntemporal coadjutors, spiritual coadjutors, professed of the three vows,\r\nand professed of the four vows.\r\n\r\nThe professed form only a small percentage of the entire body, and\r\nconstitute a sort of religious aristocracy, from which the officers of\r\nthe society are selected. Only the professed of the fourth vow, who add\r\nto the three vows a pledge of unconditional obedience to the pope,\r\npossess the full rights of membership. This final grade cannot be\r\nreached until the age of forty-five, so that if the candidate enters the\r\norder at the earliest age permissible, fourteen, he has been on\r\nprobation thirty-one years when he reaches the final grade.\r\n\r\nThe society is ruled by a general, to whom unconditional obedience is\r\nrequired. The provinces, into which the order is divided, are governed\r\nby provincials, who must report monthly to the general. The heads of all\r\nhouses and colleges must report weekly to their provincials. An\r\nelaborate system of checks and espionage is employed to ensure the\r\nperfect working of this complex ecclesiastical machinery. Fraud or\r\nevasion is carefully guarded against, and every possible means is\r\nemployed to enable the general to keep himself fully informed concerning\r\nthe minutest details of the society's affairs.\r\n\r\n_The Vow of Obedience_\r\n\r\nThat which has imparted a peculiar character to the Jesuit and\r\ncontributed more than any other force to his success, is the insistence\r\nupon unquestioning submission to the will of the superior. This emphasis\r\non the vow of obedience deserves, therefore, special consideration.\r\nLoyola, in his \"Spiritual Exercises,\" commanded the novice to preserve\r\nhis freedom of mind, but it is difficult for the fairest critic to\r\nconceive of such a possibility in the light of Loyola's rule of\r\nobedience, which reads: \"I ought not to be my own, but His who created\r\nme, and his too by whose means God governs me, yielding myself to be\r\nmoulded in his hands like so much wax.... I ought to be like a corpse,\r\nwhich has neither will nor understanding, or like a small crucifix,\r\nwhich is turned about at the will of him who holds it, or like a staff\r\nin the hands of an old man, who uses it as may best assist or\r\nplease him.\"\r\n\r\nAs an example of the kind of obedience demanded of the Jesuit, Loyola\r\ncited the obedience of Abraham, who, when he believed that Jehovah\r\ncommanded him to commit the crime of infanticide, was ready to obey. The\r\nthirteenth of the rules appended to the Spiritual Exercises says: \"If\r\nthe Church shall have defined that to be black which to our eyes appears\r\nwhite, we ought to pronounce the thing in question black.\"\r\n\r\nLoyola is reported as having said to his secretary that \"in those who\r\noffer themselves he looked less to purely natural goodness than to\r\nfirmness of character and ability for business.\" But that he did not\r\nmean _independent_ firmness of character is clearly seen in the obvious\r\nattempt of the order to destroy that noble and true independence which\r\nis the crowning glory of a lofty character. The discipline is\r\nmarvelously contrived to \"scoop the will\" out of the individual. Count\r\nPaul von Hoensbroech, who recently seceded from the society, has set\r\nforth his reasons for so doing in two articles which appeared in the\r\n\"Preussische Jahrbücher.\" A most interesting discussion of these\r\narticles, in the \"New World,\" for December, 1894, places the opinions of\r\nthe Count at our disposal. It is quite evident that he is no passionate,\r\nblind foe of the society. His tone is temperate and his praises\r\ncordially given. While recognizing the genius shown in the machinery of\r\nthe society and the nobility of the real aims of the Jesuitical\r\ndiscipline, and while protesting against the unfounded charges of\r\nimpurity, and other gross calumnies against the order, Count Paul\r\nnevertheless maintains that it \"rests on so unworthy a depreciation of\r\nindividuality, and so exaggerated an apprehension of the virtue of\r\nobedience, as to render it unfit for its higher ends.\" The uniform of\r\nthe Jesuit is not an external garb, but such freedom is insignificant in\r\nthe light of the \"veritable strait-jacket,\" which is placed upon the\r\ninward man. The unformed and pliable novice, usually between the ages of\r\nsixteen and twenty, is subjected to \"a skillful, energetic and\r\nunremitting assault upon personal independence.\" Every device that a\r\nshrewd and powerful intellect could conceive of is employed to break up\r\nthe personal will. \"The Jesuit scheme prescribes the gait, the way to\r\nhold the hands, to incline the head, to direct the eyes, to hold and\r\nmove the person.\"\r\n\r\nEvery novice must go through the \"Spiritual Exercises\" in complete\r\nsolitude, twice in his life. They occupy thirty days. The \"Account of\r\nthe Conscience\" is of the very essence of Jesuitism. The ordinary\r\nconfession, familiar to every Catholic, is as nothing compared with this\r\nmarvelous inquiry into the secrets of the human heart and mind. Every\r\nfault, sin, virtue, wish, design, act and thought,--good, bad or\r\nindifferent,--must be disclosed, and this revelation of the inner life\r\nmay be used against him who makes it, \"for the good of the order.\"\r\nThus, after fifteen years of such ingenious and detailed discipline, the\r\nyoung man's intellectual and moral faculties are moulded into Jesuitical\r\nforms. He is no longer his own. He is a pliable and obedient, even\r\nthough it may be a virtuous and brilliant, tool of a spiritual\r\nmaster-mechanic who will use him according to his own purposes, in the\r\ninterest of the society.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits have signally failed to convince the world that the type of\r\ncharacter produced by their system is worthy of admiration. The\r\n\"sacrifice of the intellect\"--a familiar watchword of the Jesuit--is far\r\ntoo high a price to pay for whatever benefits the discipline may confer.\r\nIt is contrary to human nature, and hence to the divine intention, to\r\nkeep a human soul in a state of subordination to another human will. As\r\nVon Hoensbroech says of the society: \"Who gave it a right to break down\r\nthat most precious possession of the individual being, which God gave,\r\nand which man has no authority to take away?\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that no human organization has so magnificently brought to\r\nperfection a unity of purpose and oneness of will. It is also true that\r\na spirit of defiance toward human authority is often accompanied by a\r\ndisobedience of divine law. But the remedy for the abuses of human\r\nfreedom is neither in the annihilation of the will itself, nor in its\r\nmere subjection to some other will irrespective of its moral character.\r\nCarlyle may have been too vehement in some of his censures of Jesuitism,\r\nbut he certainly exposed the fallaciousness of Loyola's views concerning\r\nthe value of mere obedience, at the same time justly rebuking the too\r\nardent admirers of the perverted principle: \"I hear much also of\r\n'obedience,' how that and kindred virtues are prescribed and exemplified\r\nby Jesuitism; the truth of which, and the merit of which, far be it from\r\nme to deny.... Obedience is good and indispensable: but if it be\r\nobedience to what is wrong and false, good heavens, there is no name for\r\nsuch a depth of human cowardice and calamity, spurned everlastingly by\r\nthe gods. Loyalty? Will you be loyal to Beelzebub? Will you 'make a\r\ncovenant with Death and Hell'? I will not be loyal to Beelzebub; I will\r\nbecome a nomadic Choctaw rather, ... anything and everything is\r\nvenial to that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Casuistry of the Jesuits_\r\n\r\nIt is often asserted, even by authoritative writers, that a Jesuit is\r\nbound by his vows to commit either venial or mortal sin at the command\r\nof his superior; and that the maxim, \"The end justifies the means,\" has\r\nnot only been the principle upon which the society has prosecuted its\r\nwork but is also explicitly taught in the rules of the order. There is\r\nnothing in the constitution of the society to justify these two serious\r\ncharges, which are not to be regarded as malicious calumnies, however,\r\nbecause the slovenly Latin in one of the rules on obedience has misled\r\nsuch competent scholars as John Addington Symonds and the historian\r\nRanke. Furthermore, judging from the doctrines of the society as set\r\nforth by many of their theologians and the political conduct of its\r\nrepresentatives, the conclusion seems inevitable that while the society\r\nmay not teach in its rules that its members are bound to obedience even\r\nto the point of sin, yet practically many of its leaders have so held\r\nand its emissaries have rendered that kind of obedience.\r\n\r\nBishop Keane admits that one of the causes for the decline and overthrow\r\nof the society was its marked tendency toward lax moral teaching. There\r\ncan be but little doubt that the Jesuits have ever been indulgent toward\r\nmany forms of sin and even crime, when committed under certain\r\ncircumstances and for the good of the order or \"the greater glory\r\nof God.\"\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to form some sort of an independent judgment on\r\nthis question, it is necessary to say a few words on the subject of\r\ncasuistry and the doctrine of probabilism.\r\n\r\nCasuistry is the application of general moral rules to given cases,\r\nespecially to doubtful ones. The medieval churchmen were much given to\r\ninventing fanciful moral distinctions and to prescribing rules to govern\r\nsupposable problems of conscience. They were not willing to trust the\r\nindividual conscience or to encourage personal responsibility. The\r\nindividual was taught to lean his whole weight on his spiritual adviser,\r\nin other words, to make the conscience of the church his own. As a\r\nresult there grew up a confused mass of precepts to guide the perplexed\r\nconscience. The Jesuits carried this system to its farthest extreme. As\r\nCharles C. Starbuck says: \"They have heaped possibility upon possibility\r\nin their endeavors to make out how far there can be subjective innocence\r\nin objective error, until they have, in more than one fundamental point,\r\nhopelessly confused their own perceptions of both[H].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Appendix, Note H.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of probabilism is founded upon the distinctions between\r\nopinions that are sure, less sure, or more sure. There are several\r\nschools of probabilists, but the doctrine itself practically amounts to\r\nthis: Since uncertainty attaches to many of our decisions in moral\r\naffairs, one must follow the more probable rule, but not always, cases\r\noften arising when it is permissible to follow a rule contrary to the\r\nmore probable one. Furthermore, as the Jesuits made war upon individual\r\nauthority, which was the key-note of the Reformation, and contended for\r\nthe authority of the church, the teaching naturally followed, that the\r\nopinion of \"a grave doctor\" may be looked upon \"as possessing a fair\r\namount of probability, and may, therefore, be safely followed, even\r\nthough one's conscience insist upon the opposite course.\" It is easy to\r\nsee that this opens a convenient door to those who are seeking\r\njustification for conduct which their consciences condemn. No doubt one\r\ncan find plausible excuses for the basest crimes, if he stills the voice\r\nof conscience and trusts himself to confusing sophistry. The glory of\r\nGod, the gravity of circumstances, necessity, the good of the church or\r\nof the order, and numerous other practical reasons can be urged to\r\nremove scruples and make a bad act seem to be a good one. But crime,\r\neven \"for the glory of God,\" is crime still.\r\n\r\nThis disagreeable subject will not be pursued further. To say less than\r\nhas been said would be to ignore one of the most prominent causes of the\r\nJesuits' ruin. To say more than this, even though the facts might\r\nwarrant it, would incur the liability of being classed among those\r\nmalicious fomentors of religious strife, for whom the writer has mingled\r\nfeelings of pity and contempt. The Society of Jesus is not the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, which has suffered much from the burden of\r\nJesuitism--wounds that are scarcely atoned for by the meritorious and\r\nself-sacrificing services on her behalf in other directions. The\r\nProtestant foes have never equaled the Catholic opponents of Jesuitism,\r\neither in their fierce hatred of the system or in their ability to\r\nexpose its essential weakness. A writer in the \"Quarterly Review,\"\r\nSeptember, 1848, says: \"Admiration and detestation of the Jesuits\r\ndivide, as far as feeling is concerned, the Roman Catholic world, with a\r\nschism deeper and more implacable than any which arrays Protestant\r\nagainst Protestant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mission of the Jesuits_\r\n\r\nThe Society of Jesus has been described as \"a naked sword, whose hilt is\r\nat Rome, and whose point is everywhere.\" It is an undisputed historical\r\nfact that Loyola's consuming passion was to accomplish the ruin of\r\nProtestantism, which had twenty years the start of him and was\r\nthreatening the very existence of the Roman hierarchy. It has already\r\nbeen shown that the destruction of heresy was the chief aim of the\r\nDominicans. What the friars failed to attain, Loyola attempted. The\r\nprincipal object of the Jesuits was the maintenance of papal authority.\r\nEven to-day the Jesuit does not hesitate to declare that his mission is\r\nto overthrow Protestantism. The Reformation was inspired by a new\r\nconception of individual freedom. The authority of tradition and of the\r\nchurch was set at naught. Loyola planted his system upon the doctrine of\r\nabsolute submission to authority. The partial success of the Jesuits,\r\nfor they did beat back the Reformation, is no doubt attributable to\r\ntheir fidelity, virtue and learning. Their devotion to the cause they\r\nloved, their willingness to sacrifice life itself, their marvelous and\r\ninstantaneous obedience to the slightest command of their leaders, made\r\nthem a compact and powerful papal army. Their methods, in many\r\nparticulars, were not beyond question, and, whatever their character,\r\nthe order certainly incurred the fiercest hostility of every nation in\r\nEurope, and even of the church itself.\r\n\r\nProfessor Anton Gindely, in his \"History of the Thirty Years' War,\"\r\nshows that Maximilian, of Bavaria, and Ferdinand, of Austria, the\r\nleaders on the Catholic side, were educated by Jesuits. He also fixes\r\nthe responsibility for that war partly upon them in the plainest terms:\r\n\"In a word, they had the consciences of Roman Catholic sovereigns and\r\ntheir ministers in their hands as educators, and in their keeping as\r\nconfessors. They led them in the direction of war, so that it was at the\r\ntime, and has since been called the Jesuits' War.\"\r\n\r\nThe strictures of Carlyle, Macaulay, Thackeray, and Lytton have been\r\nrepeatedly denounced by the Jesuits, but even their shrewd, sophistical\r\ndefences of their order afford ample justification for the attitude of\r\ntheir foes. For example, in a masterful oration, previously quoted from,\r\nin which the virtues of the Jesuits are extolled and defended, Father\r\nSherman says: \"We are expelled and driven from pillar to post because we\r\nteach men to love God.\" He describes Loyola as \"the knightly, the loyal,\r\nthe true, the father of heroes, and the maker of saints, the lover of\r\nthe all-good and the all-beautiful, crowned with the honor of sainthood,\r\nthe best-loved and the best-hated man in all the world, save only his\r\nMaster and ours.\" \"'Twas he that conceived the daring plan of forging\r\nthe weapon to beat back the Reformation.\" No one but a Jesuit could\r\nreconcile the aim of \"preaching the love of God\" with \"beating back the\r\nReformation,\" especially in view of the methods employed.\r\n\r\nNumerous gross calumnies have been circulated against the Society of\r\nJesus. The dread of a return to that deplorable intellectual and moral\r\nslavery of the pre-Reformation days is so intense, that a calm,\r\ndispassionate consideration of Jesuit history is almost impossible. But\r\nafter all just concessions have been made, two indisputable facts\r\nconfront the student: first, the universal antagonism to the order, of\r\nthe church that gave birth to it, as well as of the states that have\r\nsuffered from its meddling in political affairs; and second, the\r\ncomplete failure of the order's most cherished schemes. France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Spain, Great Britain and other nations, have been compelled\r\nin sheer self-defence to expel it from their territories. Such a\r\nsignificant fact needs some other explanation than that the Jesuit has\r\nincurred the enmity of the world merely for preaching the love of God.\r\n\r\nClement XIV., when solemnly pronouncing the dissolution of the order, at\r\nthe time his celebrated bull, entitled \"_Dominus ac Redemptor Noster_\"\r\nwhich was signed July 21, 1773, was made public, justified his action in\r\nthe following terms: \"Recognizing that the members of this society have\r\nnot a little troubled the Christian commonwealth, and that for the\r\nwelfare of Christendom it were better that the order should disappear,\"\r\netc. When Rome thus delivers her _ex cathedra_ opinion concerning her\r\nown order, an institution which she knows better than any one else, one\r\ncannot fairly be charged with prejudice and sectarianism in speaking\r\nevil of it.\r\n\r\nBut while there is much to be detested in the methods of the order,\r\nhistory does not furnish another example of such self-abnegation and\r\nintense zeal as the Jesuits have shown in the prosecution of their aims.\r\nThey planted missions in Japan, China, Africa, Ceylon, Madagascar, North\r\nand South America.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Mendicant friars by their coarseness had disgusted the\r\nupper classes; the affable and cultured Jesuit won their hearts. The\r\nJesuits became chaplains in noble families, learned the secrets of every\r\ngovernment in Europe, and became the best schoolmasters in the age. They\r\nwere to be found in various disguises in every castle of note and in\r\nevery palace. \"There was no region of the globe,\" says Macaulay, \"no\r\nwalk of speculative or active life in which Jesuits were not to be\r\nfound.\" That they were devoted to their cause no one can deny. They were\r\ncareless of life and, as one facetiously adds, of truth also. They\r\neducated, heard confessions, plotted crimes and revolutions, and\r\npublished whole libraries. Worn out by fatigue, the Jesuits still toiled\r\non with marvelous zeal. Though hated and opposed, they wore serene and\r\ncheerful countenances. In a word, they had learned to control every\r\nfaculty and every passion, and to merge every human aspiration and\r\npersonal ambition into the one supreme purpose of conquering an opposing\r\nfaith and exalting the power of priestly authority. They hold up before\r\nthe subjects of the King of Heaven a wonderful example of loving and\r\nuntiring service, which should be emulated by every servant of Christ\r\nwho too often yields an indifferent obedience to Him whom he professes\r\nto love and to serve.\r\n\r\nFrancis Parkman, in his brilliant narrative of \"The Jesuits in North\r\nAmerica,\" presents the following interesting contrast between the\r\nPuritan and the Jesuit: \"To the mind of the Puritan, heaven was God's\r\nthrone; but no less was the earth His footstool; and each in its degree\r\nand its kind had its demands on man. He held it a duty to labor and to\r\nmultiply; and, building on the Old Testament quite as much as on the\r\nNew, thought that a reward on earth as well as in heaven awaited those\r\nwho were faithful to the law. Doubtless, such a belief is widely open to\r\nabuse, and it would be folly to pretend that it escaped abuse in New\r\nEngland; but there was in it an element manly, healthful and\r\ninvigorating. On the other hand, those who shaped the character, and in\r\na great measure the destiny, of New France had always on their lips the\r\nnothingness and the vanity of life. For them, time was nothing but a\r\npreparation for eternity, and the highest virtue consisted in a\r\nrenunciation of all the cares, toils and interests of earth. That such a\r\ndoctrine has often been joined to an intense worldliness, all history\r\nproclaims; but with this we have at present nothing to do. If all\r\nmankind acted on it in good faith, the world would sink into\r\ndecrepitude. It is the monastic idea carried into the wide field of\r\nactive life, and is like the error of those who, in their zeal to\r\ncultivate their higher nature, suffer the neglected body to dwindle and\r\npine, till body and mind alike lapse into feebleness and disease.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the success of the Jesuits in stopping the progress of\r\nthe Reformation, it may be truthfully said that they have failed. The\r\nprinciples of the Reformation dominate the world and are slowly\r\nmodifying the Roman church in America. \"In truth,\" says Macaulay, \"if\r\nsociety continued to hold together, if life and property enjoyed any\r\nsecurity, it was because common sense and common humanity restrained men\r\nfrom doing what the order of Jesus assured them they might with a safe\r\nconscience do.\" Our hope for the future progress of society lies in the\r\nguiding power of this same common sense and common humanity.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the order by Pius VII., August 7th, 1814, while it\r\nrenewed the papal favor, did not allay the hostility of the civil\r\npowers. Various states have expelled them since that time, and wherever\r\nthey labor, they are still the objects of open attack or ill-disguised\r\nsuspicion. Although the order still shows \"some quivering in fingers and\r\ntoes,\" as Carlyle expresses it, the principles of the Reformation are\r\ntoo widely believed, and its benefits too deeply appreciated, to\r\njustify any hope or fear of the ultimate triumph of Jesuitism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retrospect_\r\n\r\nSo the Christian monk has greatly changed since he first appeared in the\r\ndeserts of Nitria, in Egypt. He has come from his den in the mountains\r\nto take his seat in parliaments, and find his home in palaces. He is no\r\nlonger filthy in appearance, but elegant in dress and courtly in manner.\r\nHe has exchanged his rags for jewels and silks. He is no longer the\r\nrecluse of the lonely cliffs, chatting with the animals and gazing at\r\nthe stars. He is a man of the world, with schemes of conquest filling\r\nhis brain and a love of dominion ruling his heart. He is no longer a\r\nditch-digger and a ploughman, but the proud master of councils or the\r\ncultured professor of the university. He still swears to the three vows\r\nof celibacy, poverty and obedience, but they do not mean the same thing\r\nto him that they did to the more ignorant, less cultured, but more\r\ngenuinely frank monk of the desert. Yes, he has all but completely lost\r\nsight of his ancient monastic ideal. He professes the poverty of\r\nChrist, but he cannot follow even so simple a man as his Saint Francis.\r\n\r\nIt is a long way from Jerome to Ignatius, but the end of the journey is\r\nnigh. Loyola is the last type of monastic life, or changing the figure,\r\nthe last great leader in the conquered monastic army. The good within\r\nthe system will survive, its truest exponents will still fire the\r\ncourage and win the sympathy of the devout, but best of all, man will\r\nrecover from its poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n_THE FALL OF THE MONASTERIES_\r\n\r\nThe rise of Protestantism accelerated the decline and final ruin of the\r\nmonasteries. The enthusiasm of the Mendicants and the culture of the\r\nJesuits failed to convince the governments of Europe that monasticism\r\nwas worthy to survive the destruction awaiting so many medieval\r\ninstitutions. The spread of reformatory opinions resulted in a\r\ndetermined and largely successful attack upon the monasteries, which\r\nwere rightly believed to constitute the bulwark of papal power. So\r\nimperative were the popular demands for a change, that popes and\r\ncouncils hastened to urge the members of religious orders to abolish\r\nexisting abuses by enforcing primitive rules. But while Rome practically\r\nfailed in her attempted reformations, the Protestant reformers in church\r\nand state were widely successful in either curtailing the privileges\r\nand revenues of the monks or in annihilating the monasteries.\r\n\r\nSince the sixteenth century the leading governments of Europe, even\r\nincluding those in Catholic countries, have given tangible expression to\r\npopular and political antagonism to monasticism, by the abolition of\r\nconvents, or the withdrawal of immunities and favors, for a long time a\r\nsource of monastic revenue and power. The results of this hostility have\r\nbeen so disastrous, that monasticism has never regained its former\r\nprestige and influence. Several of the older orders have risen from the\r\nruins, and a few new communities have appeared, some of which are\r\ndistinguished by their most laudable ministrations to the poor and the\r\nsick, or by their educational services. Yet notwithstanding the\r\nmodifications of the system to suit the exigencies of modern times, it\r\nseems altogether improbable that the monks will ever again wield the\r\npower they possessed before the Reformation,\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter attention will be confined to the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries under Henry VIII., in England. The suppression in that\r\ncountry was occasioned partly by peculiar, local conditions, and was\r\nmore radical and permanent than the reforms in other lands, yet it is\r\nentirely consistent with our general purpose to restrict this narrative\r\nto English history. Penetrating beneath the varying externalities\r\nattending the ruin of the monasteries in Germany, Spain, France,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy, and other countries, it will be found that the\r\nunderlying cause of the destruction of the monasteries was that the\r\nmonastic ideal conflicted with the spirit of the modern era. A\r\nconspicuous and dramatic example of this struggle between medievalism,\r\nas embodied in the monastic institution, and modern political, social\r\nand religious ideals, is to be found in the dissolution of the English\r\nmonasteries. The narrative of the suppression in England also conveys\r\nsome idea of the struggle that was carried on throughout Europe, with\r\nvarying intensity and results.\r\n\r\nThere is no more striking illustration of the power of the personal\r\nequation in the interpretation of history than that afforded by the\r\nconflicting opinions respecting the overthrow of monasticism in England.\r\nThose who mourn the loss of the monasteries cannot find words strong\r\nenough with which to condemn Henry VIII., whom they regard as\r\n\"unquestionably the most unconstitutional, the most vicious king that\r\never wore the English crown.\" Forgetting the inevitable cost of human\r\nfreedom, and lightly passing over the iniquities of the monastic system,\r\nthey fondly dwell upon the departed glory of the ancient abbeys. They\r\nrecall with sadness the days when the monks chanted their songs of\r\npraise in the chapels, or reverently bent over their books of parchment,\r\nbound in purple and gold, not that they might \"winnow the treasures of\r\nknowledge, but that they might elicit love, compunction and devotion.\"\r\nThe charming simplicity and loving service of the cloister life, in the\r\ndays of its unbroken vows, appeal to such defenders of the monks with\r\nsingular potency.\r\n\r\nTruly, the fair-minded should attempt to appreciate the sorrow, the\r\nindignation and the love of these friends of a ruined institution.\r\nPassionless logic will never enable one to do justice to the sentiments\r\nof those who cannot restrain their tears as they stand uncovered before\r\nthe majestic remains of a Melrose Abbey, or properly to estimate the\r\nmotives and methods of those who laid the mighty monastic institution\r\nin the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Character of Henry VIII_\r\n\r\nBefore considering the actual work of suppression, it may be interesting\r\nto glance at the royal destroyer and his times. The character of Henry\r\nVIII. is utterly inexplicable to many persons, chiefly because they do\r\nnot reflect that even the inconsistencies of a great man may be\r\nunderstood when seen in the light of his times. A masterly and\r\ncomprehensive summary of the virtues and vices of the Tudor monarch, who\r\nhas been described as \"the king, the whole king, and nothing but the\r\nking,\" may be found in \"A History of Crime in England,\" by Luke Owen\r\nPike. The distinguished author shows that in his brutality, his love of\r\nletters, his opposition to Luther, his vacillation in religious\r\nopinions, King Henry reflects with remarkable fidelity the age in which\r\nhe lived, both in its contrasts and its inconsistencies. \"It is only the\r\nprevious history of England which can explain all the contradictions\r\nexhibited in his conduct,--which can explain how he could be rapacious\r\nyet sometimes generous, the Defender of the Faith yet under sentence of\r\nexcommunication, a burner of heretics yet a heretic himself, the pope's\r\nadvocate yet the pope's greatest enemy, a bloodthirsty tyrant yet the\r\nbest friend to liberty of thought in religion, an enthusiast yet a\r\nturncoat, a libertine and yet all but a Puritan. He was sensual because\r\nhis forefathers had been sensual from time immemorial, rough in speech\r\nand action because there had been but few men in Britain who had been\r\notherwise since the Romans abandoned the island. He was superstitious\r\nand credulous because few were philosophical or gifted with intellectual\r\ncourage. Yet he had, what was possessed by his contemporaries, a faint\r\nand intermittent thirst for knowledge, of which he himself hardly knew\r\nthe meaning.\" Henry was shrewd, tenacious of purpose, capricious and\r\nversatile. In spite of his unrestrained indulgences and his monstrous\r\nclaims of power, which, be it remembered, he was able to enforce, and\r\nnotwithstanding any other vices or faults that may be truthfully charged\r\nagainst him, he was, on the whole, a popular king. Few monarchs have\r\never had to bear such a strain as was placed upon his abilities and\r\ncharacter. Rare have been the periods that have witnessed such\r\nconfusion of principles, social, political and religious. Those were the\r\ndays when liberty was at work, \"but in a hundred fantastical and\r\nrepulsive shapes, confused and convulsive, multiform, deformed.\" Blind\r\nviolence and half-way reforms characterized the age because the\r\nprinciples that were to govern modern times were not yet formulated.\r\n\r\nJudged apart from his times Henry appears as an arrogant, cruel and\r\nfickle ruler, whose virtues fail to atone for his vices. But still, with\r\nall his faults, he compares favorably with preceding monarchs and even\r\nwith his contemporaries. If he had possessed less intelligence, courage\r\nand ambition, he would not now be so conspicuous for his vices, but the\r\nhistory of human liberty and free institutions, especially in England,\r\nwould have been vastly different. His praiseworthy traits were not\r\nsufficiently strong to enable him to control his inherited passions, but\r\nthey were too regnant to permit him to submit without a struggle to the\r\nhierarchy which had dominated his country so many centuries. Such was\r\n\r\n                \"the majestic lord,\r\n     That broke the bonds of Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Events Preceding the Suppression_\r\n\r\nMany causes and incidents contributed to the progress of the reformation\r\nin England, and to the demolition of the monasteries. Only a few of them\r\ncan be given here, and they must be stated with a brevity that conveys\r\nno adequate conception of their profound significance.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. ascended the throne, in the year 1509, when eighteen years\r\nof age. In 1517, Luther took his stand against Rome. Four years later\r\nHenry wrote a treatise in defence of the Seven Sacraments and in\r\nopposition to the German reformer. For this princely service to the\r\nchurch the king received the title \"Defender of the Faith\" from Pope\r\nLeo X.\r\n\r\nAbout 1527 it became known that Henry was questioning the validity of\r\nhis marriage with Catharine of Aragon, whom he had married when he was\r\ntwelve years old. She was the widow of his brother Arthur. The king\r\nprofessed conscientious scruples about his marriage, but undoubtedly his\r\ndesire for male offspring, and later, his passion for Anne Boleyn,\r\nprompted him to seek release from his queen. In 1529, Henry and\r\nCatharine stood before a papal tribunal, presided over by Cardinal\r\nWolsey, the king's prime minister, and Cardinal Campeggio, from Rome,\r\nfor the purpose of determining the validity of the royal marriage. The\r\ntrial was a farce. The enraged king laid the blame upon Wolsey, and\r\nretired him from office. The great cardinal was afterwards charged with\r\ntreason, but died broken-hearted, on his way to the Tower, November\r\n29, 1530.\r\n\r\nThe breach between Henry and Rome, complicated by numerous international\r\nintrigues, widened rapidly. Henry began to assume an attitude of bold\r\ndefiance toward the pope, which aroused the animosity of the Catholic\r\nprinces of Europe.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the desire of a large body of the English people to\r\nremain faithful to Rome, the dangers which menaced their country from\r\nabroad and the ecclesiastical abuses at home, which had been a fruitful\r\ncause for complaint for many years, tended to lessen the ancient horror\r\nof heresy and schism, and inclined them to support their king. Another\r\nfactor that assisted in preparing the English people for the\r\ndestruction of the monasteries was Lollardism. As an organized sect, the\r\nLollards had ceased to exist, but the spirit and the doctrines of Wyclif\r\ndid not die. A real and a vital connection existed between the Lollards\r\nof the fourteenth, and the reformers of the sixteenth, centuries. In\r\nHenry's time, many Englishmen held practically the same views of Rome\r\nand of the monks that had been taught by Wyclif[I].\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: Appendix, Note I.]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Henry's subjects, however, while ostensibly\r\nloyal to him, were inwardly full of hot rebellion. The king was\r\nsurrounded with perils. The princes of the Continent were eagerly\r\nawaiting the bull for his excommunication. Henry's throne and his\r\nkingdom might at any moment be given over by the pope to invasion by the\r\ncontinental sovereigns.\r\n\r\nReginald Pole, afterwards cardinal, a cousin of the king, and a strong\r\nCatholic, stood ready to betray the interests of his country to Rome.\r\nWriting to the king, he said: \"Man is against you; God is against you;\r\nthe universe is against you; what can you look for but destruction?\"\r\n\"Dream not, Caesar,\" he encouragingly declared to Emperor Charles V.,\r\n\"that all generous hearts are quenched in England; that faith and piety\r\nare dead. In you is their trust, in your noble nature, and in your zeal\r\nfor God--they hold their land till you shall come.\" Thus, on the\r\ntestimony of a Roman Catholic, there were traitors in England waiting\r\nonly for the call of Charles V., \"To arms!\" Pole was in full sympathy\r\nwith all the factions opposed to the king, and stood ready to aid them\r\nin their resistance. He publicly denounced the king in several\r\ncontinental countries.\r\n\r\nThe monks were especially enraged against Henry. They did all they could\r\nto inflame the people by preaching against him and the reformers. Friar\r\nPeyto, preaching before the king, had the assurance to say to him: \"Many\r\nlying prophets have deceived you, but I, as a true Micah, warn you that\r\nthe dogs will lick your blood as they did Ahab's.\" While the courage of\r\nthis friar is unquestioned, his defiant attitude illustrates the\r\nposition occupied by the monks toward those who favored separation from\r\nRome. The whole country was at white heat. The friends of Rome looked\r\nupon Henry as an incarnate fiend, a servant of the devil and an enemy\r\nof all religion. Many of them opposed him with the purest and best\r\nmotives, believing that the king was really undermining the church of\r\nGod and throwing society into chaos.\r\n\r\nIn 1531, the English clergy were coerced into declaring that Henry was\r\n\"the protector and the supreme head of the church and of the clergy of\r\nEngland,\" which absurd claim was slightly modified by the words, \"in so\r\nfar as is permitted by the law of Christ.\" Chapuys, in one of his\r\ndespatches informing Charles V. of this action of convocation, said that\r\nit practically declared Henry the Pope of England. \"It is true,\" he\r\nwrote, \"that the clergy have added to the declaration that they did so\r\nonly so far as permitted by the law of God. But that is all the same, as\r\nfar as the king is concerned, as if they had made no reservation, for no\r\none will now be so bold as to contest with his lord the importance of\r\nthe reservation.\" Later on, Chapuys says that the king told the pope's\r\nnuncio that \"if the pope would not show him more consideration, he would\r\nshow the world that the pope had no greater authority than Moses, and\r\nthat every claim not grounded on Scripture was mere usurpation; that\r\nthe great concourse of people present had come solely and exclusively to\r\nrequest him to bastinado the clergy, who were hated by both nobles and\r\nthe people.\" (\"Spanish Despatches,\" number 460.)\r\n\r\nParliament, in 1534, conferred on Henry the title \"Supreme Head of the\r\nChurch of England,\" and empowered him \"to visit, and repress, redress,\r\nreform, order, correct, restrain, or amend all errors, heresies, abuses,\r\noffences, contempts, and enormities, which fell under any spiritual\r\nauthority or jurisdiction.\" The \"Act of Succession\" was also passed by\r\nParliament, cutting off Princess Mary and requiring all subjects to take\r\nan oath of allegiance to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt was now an act of treason to deny the king's supremacy. All persons\r\nsuspected of disloyalty were required to sign an oath of allegiance to\r\nHenry, and to Elizabeth as his successor, and to acknowledge the\r\nsupremacy of the king in church and state. This resulted in the death of\r\nsome prominent men in the realm, among them Sir Thomas More. In the\r\npreamble of the oath prescribed by law, the legality of the king's\r\nmarriage with Anne was asserted, thus implying that his former marriage\r\nwith Catharine was unlawful. More was willing to declare his allegiance\r\nto the infant Elizabeth, as the king's successor, but his conscience\r\nwould not permit him to affirm that Catharine's marriage was unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe life of the brilliant and lovable More is another illustration of\r\nthe mental confusions and inconsistencies of that age. As an apostle of\r\nculture he favored the new learning, and yet he viewed the gathering\r\nmomentum of reformatory principles with alarm, and cast in his lot with\r\nthe ultra-conservatives. Four years of his young manhood were spent in a\r\nmonastery. He devoted his splendid talents to a criticism of English\r\nsociety, and recommended freedom of conscience, yet he became an ardent\r\nfoe of reform and even a persecutor of heretics, of whom he said: \"I do\r\nso detest that class of men that, unless they repent, I am the worst\r\nenemy they have.\" When a man, whom even Protestant historians hasten to\r\npronounce \"the glory of his age,\" so magnificent were his talents and so\r\nblameless his character, was tainted with superstition, and sanctioned\r\nthe persecution of liberal thinkers, is it remarkable that inferior\r\nintellects should have been swayed by the brutality and tyranny of\r\nthe times?\r\n\r\nThe unparalleled claims of Henry and his attitude toward the pope made\r\nthe breach between England and Rome complete, but many years of painful\r\ninternal strife and bloodshed were to elapse before the whole nation\r\nsubmitted to the new order of things, and before that subjective freedom\r\nfrom fear and superstition without which formal freedom has little\r\nvalue, was secured.\r\n\r\nThe breach with Rome was essential to the attainment of that religious\r\nand political freedom that England now enjoys. But the first step toward\r\nmaking that separation an accomplished fact, acquiesced in by the people\r\nas a whole, was to break the power of the monastic orders. It may\r\npossibly be true that the same ends would have been eventually attained\r\nby trusting to the slower processes of social evolution, but the history\r\nof the Latin nations of Europe would seem to prove the contrary. As the\r\nfacts stand it would appear that peace and progress were impossible with\r\nthousands of monks sowing seeds of discord, and employing every measure,\r\nfair or foul, to win the country back to Rome. Gairdner and others\r\nargue that Henry was far too powerful a king to have been successfully\r\nresisted by the pope, unless the pope was backed by a union of the\r\nChristian princes, which was then impracticable. That fact may make the\r\nexecution of More, Fisher and the Charterhouse monks inexcusable, but it\r\nby no means proves that Henry would have been strong enough to maintain\r\nhis position if the monasteries had been permitted to exist as centers\r\nof organized opposition to his will. Many of the monks, when pressed by\r\nthe king's agents, took the oath of allegiance. Threats, bribes and\r\nviolence were used to overcome the opposition of the unwilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Monks and the Oath of Supremacy_\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the king's purpose to destroy the whole\r\nmonastic institution was partly the result of the determined resistance\r\nwhich the monks offered to his authority. The contest between the king\r\nand the monks was exceedingly fierce and bloody. Many good men lost\r\ntheir lives and many innocent persons suffered grievously. Perhaps the\r\nmost pathetic incident in the sanguinary struggle between the king and\r\nthe monks was the tragic fall of the Charterhouse of London. The facts\r\nare given at length by Froude, in his \"History of England,\" who bases\r\nhis account on the narrative of Maurice Channey, one of the monks who\r\nescaped death by yielding to the king. The unhappy monk confesses that\r\nhe was a Judas among the apostles, and in a touching account of the ruin\r\nthat came upon his monastic retreat he praises the boldness and fidelity\r\nof his companions, who preferred death to what seemed to them dishonor.\r\n\r\nThe pages of Channey are filled with the most improbable stories of\r\nmiracles, but his charming picture of the cloister life of the\r\nCarthusians is doubtless true to reality. The Carthusian fathers were\r\nthe best fruit of monasticism in England. To a higher degree than any of\r\nthe other monastic orders they maintained a good discipline and\r\npreserved the spirit of their founders. \"A thousand years of the world's\r\nhistory had rolled by,\" says Froude, \"and these lonely islands of prayer\r\nhad remained still anchored in the stream; the strands of the ropes\r\nwhich held them, wearing now to a thread, and very near their last\r\nparting, but still unbroken.\" In view of the undisputed purity and\r\nfearlessness of these noble monks, a recital of their woes will place\r\nthe case for the monastic institution in the most favorable light.\r\n\r\nChanney says the year 1533 was ushered in with signs,--the end of the\r\nworld was nigh. Yes, the monk's world was drawing to a close; the moon,\r\nfor him, was turning into blood, and the stars falling from heaven.\r\n\r\nMore and Fisher were in the Tower. The former's splendid talents and\r\nnoble character still swayed the people. It was no time for trifling;\r\nthe Carthusian fathers must take the oath of allegiance or perish. So\r\none morning the royal commissioners appeared before the monastery door\r\nof the Charterhouse to demand submission. Prior Houghton answered them:\r\n\"I know nothing of the matter mentioned; I am unacquainted with the\r\nworld without; my office is to minister to God, and to save poor souls\r\nfrom Satan.\" He was committed to the Tower for one month. Then Dr.\r\nBonner persuaded the prior to sign with \"certain reservations.\" He was\r\nreleased and went back to his cloister-cell to weep. Calling his monks\r\ntogether he said he was sorry; it looked like deceit, but he desired to\r\nsave his brethren and their order. The commissioners returned; the monks\r\nwere under suspicion; the reservations were disliked, and they must sign\r\nwithout conditions. In great consternation the prior assembled the\r\nmonks. All present cried out: \"Let us die together in our integrity, and\r\nheaven and earth shall witness for us how unjustly we are cut off.\"\r\nPrior Houghton conceived a generous idea. \"If it depends on me alone; if\r\nmy oath will suffice for the house, I will throw myself on the mercy of\r\nGod; I will make myself anathema, and to preserve you from these\r\ndangers, I will consent to the king's will.\" Thus did the noble old man\r\nconsent to go into heaven with a lie on his conscience, hoping to escape\r\nby the mercy of God, because he sought to save the lives of his\r\nbrethren. But all this was of no avail; Cromwell had determined that\r\nthis monastery must fall, and fall it did. The monks prepared for their\r\nend calmly and nobly; beginning with the oldest brother, they knelt\r\nbefore each other and begged forgiveness for all unkindness and offence.\r\n\"Not less deserving,\" says Froude, \"the everlasting remembrances of\r\nmankind, than those three hundred, who, in the summer morning, sate\r\ncombing their golden hair in the passes of Thermopylæ.\" But rebellion\r\nwas blazing in Ireland, and the enemies of the king were praying and\r\nplotting for his ruin. These monks, with More and Fisher, were an\r\ninspiration to the enemies of liberty and the kingdom. Catholic Europe\r\ncrouched like a tiger ready to spring on her prostrate foe. It is sad,\r\nbut these recluses, praying for the pope, instilling a love for the\r\npapacy in the confessional, these honest and conscientious but dangerous\r\nmen must be shorn of their power to encourage rebels. There was a farce\r\nof a trial. Houghton was brought to the scaffold and died protesting his\r\ninnocence. His arm was cut off and hung over the archway of the\r\nCharterhouse, as other arms and heads were hideously hanging over many a\r\nmonastic gate in Merry England. Nine of the monks died of prison fever,\r\nand others were banished. The king's court went into mourning, and Henry\r\nknotted his beard and henceforth would be no more shaven--eloquent\r\nevidence to the world that whatever motive dominated the king's heart,\r\nthese bloody deeds were unpleasantly disturbing. Certainly such a\r\nspectacle as that of a monk's arm nailed to a monastery was never seen\r\nby Englishmen before.\r\n\r\nThe Charterhouse fell, let it be carefully noted, because the monks\r\ncould not and would not acknowledge the king's supremacy, and not\r\nbecause the monks were immoral. Some spies in Cromwell's service offered\r\nto, bring in evidence against six of these monks of \"laziness and\r\nimmorality.\" Cromwell indignantly refused the proposal, saying, \"He\r\nwould not hear the accusation; that it was false, wilfully so.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of these proceedings, and of the beheading of More and Fisher,\r\nawakened the most violent rage throughout Catholic Europe. Henry was\r\ndenounced as the Nero of his times. Paul III. immediately excommunicated\r\nthe king, dissolved all leagues between Henry and the Catholic princes,\r\nand gave his kingdom to any invader. All Catholic subjects were ordered\r\nto take up arms against him. Although these censures were passed, the\r\npope decided to defer their publication, hoping for a peaceful\r\nsettlement. But Henry knew, and the Catholic princes of Europe knew,\r\nthat the blow might fall at any time. He had to make up his mind to go\r\nfurther or to yield unconditionally to the pope. The world soon\r\ndiscovered the temper of the enraged and stubborn monarch. He might\r\nvacillate on speculative questions, but there were no tokens of feeble\r\nhesitancy in his dealings with Rome. The hour of doom for the\r\nmonasteries had struck.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at the character of Henry VIII., the prime mover in\r\nthe attack upon the monasteries, and having surveyed some of the events\r\nleading up to their fall, we are now prepared to consider the actual\r\nwork of suppression, which will be described under the following heads:\r\nFirst, The royal commissioners and their methods of investigation;\r\nSecond, The commissioners' report on the condition of affairs; Third,\r\nThe action of Parliament; Fourth, The effect of the suppression upon the\r\npeople; and Fifth, The use Henry made of the monastic possessions. These\r\nmatters having been set forth, it will then be in order to inquire into\r\nthe justification, real or alleged, of the suppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Royal Commissioners and Their Methods of Investigation_\r\n\r\nThe fall of Sir Thomas More left Thomas Cromwell the chief power under\r\nthe king, and for seven years he devoted his great administrative\r\nabilities to making his royal patron absolute ruler in church and state.\r\n\r\nCromwell, Earl of Essex, was of lowly origin, but his energy and\r\nshrewdness, together with the experience acquired by extensive travels,\r\ncommanded the attention of Cardinal Wolsey, who took him into his\r\nservice. He was successively merchant, scrivener, money-lender, lawyer,\r\nmember of parliament, master of jewels, chancellor, master of rolls,\r\nsecretary of state, vicar-general in ecclesiastical affairs, lord privy\r\nseal, dean of Wells and high chamberlain.\r\n\r\nClose intimacy with Wolsey enabled Cromwell to grasp the full\r\nsignificance of Henry's ambition, and his desire to please his royal\r\nmaster, coupled with his own love of power, prompted him to throw\r\nhimself with characteristic energy into the work of centralizing all\r\nauthority in the hands of the king and of his prime minister. In secular\r\naffairs, this had already been accomplished. The task before him was to\r\nsubdue the church to the throne, to execute which he became the\r\nprotector of Protestantism and the foe of Rome. Green says: \"He had an\r\nabsolute faith in the end he was pursuing, and he simply hews his way to\r\nit, as a woodman hews his way through the forest, axe in hand.\" Froude\r\nsays: \"To him ever belonged the rare privilege of genius to see what\r\nother men could not see, and therefore he was condemned to rule a\r\ngeneration which hated him, to do the will of God and to perish in his\r\nsuccess. He pursued an object, the excellence of which, as his mind saw\r\nit, transcended all other considerations, the freedom of England and the\r\ndestruction of idolatry, and those who, from any motive, noble or base,\r\npious or impious, crossed his path, he crushed and passed on over\r\ntheir bodies.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a general agreement that Cromwell was not a\r\nProtestant. His struggle against the temporal power of the pope fostered\r\nthe reformatory movement, but that did not make Cromwell a Protestant\r\nany more than it did his master, Henry VIII. Foxe describes Cromwell \"as\r\na valiant soldier and captain of Christ,\" but Maitland retorts \"that\r\nFoxe forgot, if he ever knew, who was the father of lies.\"\r\n\r\nWithout doubt Cromwell ruled with an iron hand. He was guilty of\r\naccepting bribes, and, as some maintain, \"was the great patron of\r\nribaldry, and the protector of the low jester and the filthy.\" But,\r\nsadly enough, that is no serious charge against one in his times. It is\r\nsaid that Henry used to say, when a knave was dealt to him in a game of\r\ncards, \"Ah, I have a Cromwell!\" Francis Aidan Gasquet, a Benedictine\r\nmonk, in his valuable work on \"Henry VIII. and the English Monasteries,\"\r\nsays of Cromwell: \"No single minister in England ever exercised such\r\nextensive authority, none ever rose so rapidly, and no one has ever left\r\nbehind him a name covered with greater infamy and disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1535, Henry, as supreme head of the church, appointed Cromwell as his\r\n\"Vicegerent, Vicar-General and Principal Commissary in causes\r\necclesiastical.\" His immediate duty was to enforce recognition of the\r\nking's supremacy. The monks and the clergy were now to be coerced into\r\nsubmission. A royal commission, consisting of Legh, Layton, Ap Rice,\r\nLondon and various subordinates, was appointed to visit the monasteries\r\nand to report on their condition.\r\n\r\nHenry Griffin says in his chronicle: \"I was well acquainted with all the\r\ncommissioners; indeed I knew them well; they were very smart men, who\r\nunderstood the value of money, for they had tasted of adversity. I think\r\nthe priests were the worst of the whole party, although they had a good\r\nreputation at the time, but they were wicked, deceitful men. I am sorry\r\nto speak thus of my own order, but I speak God's truth.\" \"It is a\r\ndreadful undertaking,\" said Lord Clinton. \"Ah! but I have great faith in\r\nthe tact and judgment of the men I am about to select,\"\r\nretorted Cromwell.\r\n\r\nDr. John London was a base tool of Cromwell, and a miserable exponent of\r\nthe reform movement. He joined Gardiner in burning heretics, was\r\nconvicted of adultery at Oxford, was pilloried for perjury and died in\r\njail. The other royal agents were also questionable characters. Dean\r\nLayton wrote the most disgusting letters to Cromwell. Once he informed\r\nhis patron that he prayed regularly for him, prefacing this information\r\nwith the remark, \"I will now tell you something to make you laugh.\"\r\n\r\nFather Gasquet sums up his view of the commissioners in the words of\r\nEdmund Burke: \"It is not with much credulity that I listen to any when\r\nthey speak ill of those whom they are going to plunder. I rather suspect\r\nthat vices are feigned, or exaggerated, when profit is looked for in the\r\npunishment--an enemy is a bad witness; a robber worse.\" Burke\r\nindignantly declares: \"The inquiry into the moral character of the\r\nreligious houses was a mere pretext, a complete delusion, an insidious\r\nand predetermined foray of wholesale and heartless plunder.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the protests from the defenders of the monasteries even before\r\na hearing is granted. \"What,\" say they, \"believe such perjurers,\r\nadulterers and gamblers; men forsworn to bring in a bad report; men who\r\nwere selected because they were worthless characters who could be\r\nrelied on to return false charges against an institution loved by\r\nthe people?\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners began their work at Oxford, in September, 1535. The\r\nwork was vigorously pushed. On reaching the door of a monastery, they\r\ndemanded admittance; if it was not granted, they entered by breaking\r\ndown the gate with an axe. They then summoned the monks before them, and\r\nplied them with questions. An inventory was taken of everything; nothing\r\nescaped their searching eyes. When the king decided to suppress the\r\nlesser monasteries, and ordered a new visitation of the larger ones,\r\nthey seized and sold all they could lay their hands on; \"stained glass,\r\nironwork, bells, altar-cloths, candles, books, beads, images, capes,\r\nbrewing-tubs, brass bolts, spits for cooking, kitchen utensils, plates,\r\nbasins, all were turned into money.\" Many valuable books were destroyed;\r\njewels and gold and silver clasps were torn from old volumes, and the\r\npaper sold as waste; parchment manuscripts were used to scour tubs and\r\ngrease boots. Out of the wreck about a hundred and thirty thousand\r\nmanuscripts have been saved. It must be admitted that the commissioners\r\nwere not delicate in their labors; that they insulted many nuns, robbed\r\nthe monks, violated the laws of decency and humanity, and needlessly\r\nexcited the rage of the people and outraged the religious sentiments of\r\nthe Catholics. They even used sacred altar-cloths for blankets on their\r\nhorses, and rode across the country decorated in priestly and monkish\r\ngarments. There seems to be some ground for the statement that Henry was\r\nignorant, or at least not fully informed, of their unwarranted violence\r\nand gross sacrilege. The abbey of Glastonbury was one of the oldest and\r\nfinest cloisters in England. It was a majestic pile of buildings in the\r\nmidst of gardens and groves covering sixty acres; its aisles were vocal\r\nwith the chanting of monks, who marched in gorgeous processions among\r\nthe tall, gray pillars. The exterior of the buildings was profusely\r\ndecorated with sculpture; monarchs, temple knights, mitered abbots,\r\nmartyrs and apostles stood for centuries in their niches of stone while\r\nprinces came and passed away, while kingdoms rose and fell. The nobles\r\nand bishops of the realm were laid to rest beneath the altars around\r\nwhich many generations of monks had assembled to praise and to pray. The\r\nroyal commissioners one day appeared before the walls. The abbot,\r\nRichard Whiting, who was then eighty-four years of age, was at\r\nSharphorn, another residence of the community. He was brought back and\r\nquestioned. At night when he was in bed, they searched his study for\r\nletters and books, and they claimed to have found a manuscript of\r\nWhiting's arguments against the divorce of the king and Queen Catharine;\r\nit had never been published; they did not know whether the venerable\r\nabbot had such intent or not. Stephen declares the spies themselves\r\nbrought the book into the library. However, the abbot was chained to a\r\ncart and taken to London. The abbey had immense wealth; every Wednesday\r\nand Friday it fed and lodged three hundred boys; it was esteemed very\r\nhighly in the neighborhood and received large donations from the knights\r\nin the vicinity. The abbot was accused of treason for concealing the\r\nsacred vessels; he was old, deaf, and sick, but was allowed no counsel.\r\nHe asked permission to take leave of his monks, and many little\r\norphans; Russell and Layton only laughed. The people heard of his\r\ncaptivity and determined \"to deliver or avenge\" their favorite, but\r\nRussell hanged half a dozen of them and declared that \"law, order and\r\nloyalty were vindicated.\" Whiting's body was quartered, and the pieces\r\nsent to Wells, Bath, Chester and Bridgewater, while his head, adorned\r\nwith his gray hairs clotted by blood, was hung over the abbey gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Report of the Commissioners_\r\n\r\nThe original report of the commissioners does not exist. Burnet declares\r\nthat he saw an extract from it, concerning one hundred and forty-four\r\nhouses, which contained the most revolting revelations. Many of the\r\ncommissioners' letters and various documents touching the suppression\r\nhave been collected and published by the Camden Society. Waiving, for\r\nthe present, the inquiry into the truth of the report, it was in\r\nsubstance as follows:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners reported about one-third of the houses to be fairly\r\nwell conducted, some of them models of excellent management and pure\r\nliving; but the other two-thirds were charged with looseness beyond\r\ndescription. The number of inmates in some cloisters was kept below the\r\nrequired number, that there might be more money to divide among the\r\nmonks. The number of servants sometimes exceeded that of the monks.\r\nAbbots bought and sold land in a fraudulent manner; gifts for\r\nhospitality were misapplied; licentiousness, gaming and drinking\r\nprevailed extensively. Crime and absolution for gold went hand in hand.\r\nOne friar was said to have been the proud father of an illegitimate\r\nfamily of children, but he had in his possession a forged license from\r\nthe pope, who permitted his wandering, \"considering his frailty.\"\r\nFroude, in commenting upon the report, says: \"If I were to tell the\r\ntruth, I should have first to warn all modest eyes to close the book and\r\nread no farther.\"\r\n\r\nAll sorts of pious frauds were revealed. At Hales the monks claimed to\r\nhave the blood of Christ brought from Jerusalem, and not visible to\r\nanyone in mortal sin until he had performed good works, or, in other\r\nwords, paid enough for his absolution. Two monks took the blood of a\r\nduck, which they renewed every week; this they put into a phial, one\r\nside of which consisted of a thin, transparent crystal; the other thick\r\nand opaque; the dark side was shown until the sinner's gold was\r\nexhausted, when, presto! change, the blood appeared by turning the other\r\nside of the phial. Innumerable toe-parings, bones, pieces of skin, three\r\nheads of St. Ursula, and other anatomical relics of departed saints,\r\nwere said to cure every disease known to man. They had relics that could\r\ndrive away plagues, give rain, hinder weeds, and in fact, render the\r\nnatural world the plaything of decaying bones and shreds of dried skin.\r\nThe monks of Reading had an angel with one wing, who had preserved the\r\nspear with which our Lord was pierced. Abbots were found to have\r\nconcubines in or near the monasteries; midnight revels and drunken\r\nfeasts were pleasant pastimes for monks weary with prayers and fasting.\r\nWhile it would be unjust to argue that the existence of \"pious frauds\"\r\naffords a justification for the suppression of the monasteries, it must\r\nbe remembered that they constituted one element in that condition of\r\necclesiastical life that was becoming repugnant to the English people.\r\nFor several generations there had been a marked growth in the hostility\r\ntoward various forms of superstition. True, neither Henry nor Cromwell\r\ncan be accredited with the lofty intention of exterminating\r\nsuperstition, but the attitude of many people toward \"pious frauds\"\r\nhelped to reconcile them to the destruction of the monasteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Action of Parliament_\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners was laid before Parliament in 1536. As\r\nit declared that the smaller monasteries were more corrupt than the\r\nlarger ones, Parliament ordered the suppression of all those houses\r\nwhose revenues were less than two hundred pounds per annum. By this act,\r\nthree hundred and seventy-six houses were suppressed, whose aggregate\r\nrevenue was thirty-two thousand pounds yearly. Movable property valued\r\nat about one hundred thousand pounds was also handed over to the \"Court\r\nof Augmentations of the King's Revenue,\" which was established to take\r\ncare of the estates, revenues and other possessions of the monasteries.\r\nIt is claimed that ten thousand monks and nuns were turned out into the\r\nworld, to find bed and board as best they could. In 1538, two years\r\nlater, the greater monasteries met a similar fate, which was no doubt\r\nhastened by the rebellions that followed the abolition of the smaller\r\nhouses. Many of the abbots and monks were suspected of aiding in the\r\nrebellion against the king's authority by inciting the people to take up\r\narms against him. Apprehending the coming doom, many abbots resigned;\r\nothers were overcome by threats and yielded without a struggle. In many\r\ninstances such monks received pensions varying from fifty-three\r\nshillings and four pence to four pounds a year. The investigations were\r\nconstantly carried on, and all the foul stories that could be gathered\r\nwere given to the people, to secure their approval of the king's action.\r\nWith remorseless zeal the king and his commissioners, supported by\r\nvarious acts of parliament, persevered in their work of destruction,\r\nuntil even the monastic hospitals, chantries, free chapels and\r\ncollegiate churches, fell into the king's hands. By the year 1545, the\r\nruin was complete. The monastic institution of England was no more. The\r\ntotal number of monasteries suppressed is variously estimated, but the\r\nfollowing figures are approximately correct: monasteries, 616; colleges,\r\n90; free chapels, 2,374; and hospitals, 110. The annual income was about\r\none hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which was a smaller sum than was\r\nthen believed to be in the control of the monks. Nearly fifty thousand\r\npersons were driven from the houses, to foment the discontent and to\r\narouse the pity of the people. Such, in brief, was the extent of the\r\nsuppression, but a little reflection will show that these statements of\r\ncold facts convey no conception of the confusion and sorrow that must\r\nhave accompanied this terrific and wholesale assault upon an institution\r\nthat had been accumulating its possessions for eight hundred years. At\r\nthis distance from those tragic events, it is impossible to realize the\r\ndismay of those who stood aghast at this ruthless destruction of such\r\nvenerable establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effect of the Suppression Upon the People_\r\n\r\nFor months the country had seen what was coming; letters from abbots and\r\npriors poured in upon the king and parliament, begging them to spare the\r\nancient strongholds of religion. The churchmen argued: \"If he plunders\r\nthe monasteries, will not his next step be to plunder the churches?\"\r\nThey recalled what Sir Thomas More had said of their sovereign: \"It is\r\ntrue, his majesty is very gracious with me, but if only my head would\r\ngive him another castle in France, it would not be long before it\r\ndisappeared.\" Sympathy for the monks, an inborn conservatism, a natural\r\nlove for ancient institutions, a religious dread of trampling upon that\r\nwhich was held sacred by the church, a secret antipathy to reform, all\r\nthese and other forces were against the suppression. But the report of\r\nthe visitors was appalling, and the fear of the king's displeasure was\r\nwidespread; so the bill was passed amid mingled feelings of joy,\r\nsympathy, hatred, fear, anxiety and uncertainty. The bishops were\r\nsullen; Latimer was disappointed, for he wanted the church to have\r\nthe proceeds.\r\n\r\nOutside of Parliament there was much discontent among the nobles and\r\ngentry of Roman tendencies. Even the indifferent felt bitter against the\r\nking, because it seemed unjust that the monks, who had been sheltered,\r\nhonored and enriched by the people, should be so rudely and so suddenly\r\nturned out of their possessions. A dangerously large portion of the\r\npeople felt themselves insulted and outraged. At first, however, there\r\nwere few who dared to voice their protests. \"As the royal policy\r\ndisclosed itself,\" says Green, \"as the monarchy trampled under foot the\r\ntradition and reverence of ages gone by, as its figure rose, bare and\r\nterrible, out of the wreck of old institutions, England simply held her\r\nbreath. It is only through the stray depositions of royal spies that we\r\ncatch a glimpse of the wrath and hate which lay seething under the\r\nsilence of the people.\" That silence was a silence of terror. To use the\r\nfigure by which Erasmus describes the time, men felt \"as if a scorpion\r\nlay sleeping under every stone.\" They stopped writing, gossiping, going\r\nto confession, and sending presents for the most thoughtless word or\r\ndeed might be tortured into treason against the king by the command\r\nof Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which followed the first attack upon the monasteries was\r\nnot caused wholly by religious sentiments. The nobles regarded Cromwell\r\nas a base-born usurper and yearned for his fall, while the clergy felt\r\noutraged by his monstrous claims of authority in ecclesiastical affairs.\r\nIn a sense the conflict that ensued was but a continuation of the\r\nlong-standing struggle between the king, the barons, and the clergy for\r\nthe supreme power. From the reign of Edward I., the people had commenced\r\nto assert their rights and the struggle had become a four-sided one.\r\n\r\nThese four factions were constantly shifting their allegiance, according\r\nto the varying conditions, and guided by their changing interests. At\r\nthis time, the clergy, the nobles and the people in northern England,\r\nparticularly, combined against the king, although the alliance was not\r\nformidable enough to overcome the forces supporting the king.\r\n\r\nThe secular clergy felt that they were disgraced and coerced into\r\nsubmission. They felt their revenues, their honors, their powers, their\r\nglory, slipping away from them; they joined their mutterings and\r\ndiscontent with that of the monks, and then the fires of the rebellion\r\nblazed forth in the north, where the monasteries were more popular than\r\nin any other part of England.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak occurred in Lincolnshire, in the autumn of 1536. It\r\nwas easily and quickly suppressed. But another uprising in Yorkshire, in\r\nnorthern England, followed immediately, and for a time threatened\r\nserious consequences. Some of the best families in that part of the\r\ncountry joined the revolt, although it is noteworthy that these same\r\nfamilies were afterwards Protestant and Puritan; the rebel army numbered\r\nabout forty thousand men, well equipped for service. Many prominent\r\nabbots and sixteen hundred monks were in the ranks. The masses were\r\nbound by oath \"to stand together for the love which they bore to\r\nAlmighty God, His faith, the Holy Church, and the maintenance thereof;\r\nto the preservation of the king's person and his issue; to the purifying\r\nof the nobility, and to expel all villein blood and evil counsellors\r\nfrom the king's presence; not from any private profit, nor to do his\r\npleasure to any private person, nor to slay or murder through envy, but\r\nfor the restitution of the Church, and the suppression of heretics and\r\ntheir opinions.\" It is clear, from the language of the oath, that the\r\nrebels aimed their blows at Cromwell. The secular clergy hated him\r\nbecause he had shorn them of their power; the monks hated him because he\r\nhad turned them out of their cloisters, and clergy and people loathed\r\nhim as a maintainer of heresy, a low-born foe of the Church. The\r\ninsurgents carried banners on which was printed a crucifix, a chalice\r\nand host, and the five wounds, hence they called themselves \"Pilgrims of\r\nGrace.\" The revolt was headed by Robert Aske, a barrister.\r\n\r\nCromwell acted most cautiously; he selected the strongest men to take\r\nthe field. Richard Cromwell said of one of them, Sir John Russell, \"for\r\nmy lord admiral, he is so earnest in the matter that I dare say he could\r\neat the Pilgrims without salt.\" The Duke of Norfolk was entrusted with\r\nthe command of the king's forces.\r\n\r\nHenry preferred negotiation to battle, in accepting which the rebels\r\nwere doomed. To wait was to fail. Their demands reduced to paper were:\r\n1. The religious houses should be restored. 2. England should be\r\nreunited with Rome. 3. The first fruits and tenths should not be paid to\r\nthe crown. 4. Heretics, meaning Cranmer, Latimer and others, should\r\ncease to be bishops. 5. Catharine's daughter Mary should be restored as\r\nheiress to the crown. These and other demands, the granting of which\r\nwould have meant the death of the Reformation, were firmly refused by\r\nthe king, who marveled that ignorant churls, \"brutes and inexpert folk\"\r\nshould talk of theological and political subjects to him and to\r\nhis council.\r\n\r\nAfter several ineffectual attempts to meet the royal army in battle,\r\npartly due to storms and lack of subsistence, the rebels were induced to\r\ndisperse and a general amnesty was declared. But new insurrections broke\r\nout in various quarters, and the enraged king determined to stamp out\r\nthe smoldering fires of sedition. About seventy-five persons were\r\nhanged, and many prominent men were imprisoned and afterwards executed.\r\nThis effectually suppressed the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe revolt showed the strength of the opponents to the king's will, but\r\nit also proved conclusively that the monarchy was the strongest power in\r\nthe realm; that the star of ecclesiastical domination had set forever in\r\nEngland; that henceforth English kings and not Italian popes were to\r\ngovern the English people. True, the king was carrying things with a\r\nhigh hand, but one reform at a time; the yoke of papal power must first\r\nbe lifted, even if at the same time the king becomes despotic in the\r\nexercise of his increased power. Once free from Rome, constitutional\r\nrights may be asserted and the power of an absolute monarchy judiciously\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Pilgrimage of Grace came the complete overthrow of the\r\nmonastic system by the dissolution of the larger monasteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry's Disposal of Monastic Revenues_\r\n\r\nWhat use did Henry make of the revenues that fell into his hands? As\r\nsoon as the vast estates of the monks were under the king's control, he\r\nwas besieged by nobles, \"praying for an estate.\" They kneeled before\r\nhim and specified what lands they wanted. They bribed Cromwell, who sold\r\nmany of the estates at the rate of a twenty years' purchase, and in some\r\ninstances presented valuable possessions to the king's followers. Many\r\nfamilies, powerful in England at the present time, date the beginning of\r\ntheir wealth and position to the day when their ancestors received their\r\nshare of the king's plunder.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting passage from Sir Edward Coke's Institutes,\r\nshows that Henry sought to quiet the fears of the people by making the\r\nmost captivating promises concerning the decrease of taxes, and other\r\nmagnificent schemes for the general welfare: \"On the king's behalf, the\r\nmembers of both houses were informed in Parliament that no king or\r\nkingdom was safe but where the king had three abilities: 1. To live of\r\nhis own and able to defend his kingdom upon any sudden invasion or\r\ninsurrection. 2. To aid his confederates, otherwise they would never\r\nassist him. 3. To reward his well-deserving servants. Now the project\r\nwas, that if Parliament would give unto him all the abbeys, priories,\r\nfriaries, nunneries, and other monasteries, that forever in time then\r\nto come he would take order that the same should not be converted to\r\nprivate uses, but first, that his exchequer, for the purpose aforesaid,\r\nshould be enriched; secondly, the kingdom should be strengthened by a\r\ncontinual maintenance of forty thousand well-trained soldiers; thirdly,\r\nfor the benefit and ease of the subject, who never afterwards (as was\r\nprojected), in any time to come, should be charged with subsidies,\r\nfifteenths, loans or other common aids; fourthly, lest the honor of the\r\nrealm should receive any diminution of honor by the dissolution of the\r\nsaid monasteries, there being twenty-nine lords of Parliament of the\r\nabbots and priors, ... that the king would create a number of nobles.\"\r\n\r\nThe king was granted the revenues of the monasteries. About half the\r\nmoney was expended in coast defences and a new navy; and much of it was\r\nlavished upon his courtiers. With the exception of small pensions to the\r\nmonks and the establishment of a few benefices, very little of the\r\nsplendid revenue was ever devoted to religious or educational purposes.\r\nSmall sums were set apart for Cambridge, Oxford and new grammar schools.\r\nNot-withstanding the pensions, there was much suffering; it is said\r\nmany of the outcast monks and nuns starved and froze to death by the\r\nroadside. Latimer and others wanted the king to employ the revenues for\r\nreligious purposes, but Henry evidently thought the church had enough\r\nand refused. He did, however, intend to allot eighteen thousand pounds a\r\nyear for eighteen new bishoprics, but once the gold was in his\r\npossession, his pious intentions suffered a decline, and he established\r\nonly six, with inferior endowments, five of which exist to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Was the Suppression Justifiable?_\r\n\r\nIt is quite common to restrict this inquiry to a consideration of the\r\nreport made by the commissioners against the monks, and to the methods\r\nemployed by them in their investigations. The implication is that if the\r\naccusations against the monasteries can be discredited, or if it can be\r\nshown that the motives of the destroyers were selfish and their methods\r\ncruel, then it follows that the overthrow of the monasteries was a most\r\niniquitous and unwarrantable proceeding. Reflection will show that the\r\nquestion cannot be so restricted. It may be found that the monastic\r\ninstitution should have been destroyed, even though the charges against\r\nthe monks were grossly exaggerated, the motives of the king unworthy,\r\nand the means he employed despicable.\r\n\r\nAt the outset a few facts deserve mention. It is usual for Protestants\r\nto recall with pride the glorious heroism of Protestant martyrs, but it\r\nshould be remembered that Roman Catholicism also has had its martyrs.\r\nProtestant powers have not been free from tyranny and bloodshed. That\r\nnoble spirit of self-sacrifice which has glorified many a character in\r\nhistory is not to be despised in one who dies for what we may pronounce\r\nto be false.\r\n\r\nIt must also be granted that the action of the king was not dictated by\r\na pure passion for religious reform. Indeed it is a fair question\r\nwhether Henry may be claimed by the Protestants at all. Aside from his\r\nrejection of the pope's authority, he was thoroughly Catholic in\r\nconviction and in practice. His impatience with the pope's position\r\nrespecting his divorce, his need of money, his love of power, and many\r\nother personal considerations determined his attitude toward\r\nthe papacy.\r\n\r\nIt should also be freely conceded that the royal commissioners were far\r\nfrom exemplary characters, and that they were often insolent and cruel\r\nin the prosecution of their work.\r\n\r\n\"Our posterity,\" says John Bale, \"may well curse this wicked fact of our\r\nage; this unreasonable spoil of England's most noble antiquities.\" \"On\r\nthe whole,\" says Blunt, \"it may be said that we must ever look back on\r\nthat destruction as a series of transactions in which the sorrow, the\r\nwaste, the impiety that were wrought, were enough to make the angels\r\nweep. It may be true that the monastic system had worn itself out for\r\npractical good; or at least, that it was unfitted for those coming ages\r\nwhich were to be so different from the ages that were past. But\r\nslaughter, desecration and wanton destruction, were no remedies for its\r\nsins, or its failings; nor was covetous rapacity the spirit of\r\nreformation.\"\r\n\r\nHume observes that \"during times of faction, especially of a religious\r\nkind, no equity is to be expected from adversaries; and as it was known\r\nthat the king's intention in this visitation was to find a pretext for\r\nabolishing the monasteries, we may naturally conclude that the reports\r\nof the commissioners are very little to be relied upon.\" Hallam declares\r\nthat \"it is impossible to feel too much indignation at the spirit in\r\nwhich the proceedings were conducted.\"\r\n\r\nBut these and other just and honorable concessions in the interests of\r\ntruth, which are to be found on the pages of eminent Protestant\r\nhistorians, are made to prove too much. It must be said that writers\r\nfavorable to monasticism take an unfair advantage of these admissions,\r\nwhich simply testify to a spirit of candor and a love of truth, but do\r\nnot contain the final conclusions of these historians. Employing these\r\nwitnesses to confirm their opinions, the defenders of monasticism\r\nproceed with fervid, glowing rhetoric, breathing devotion and love on\r\nevery page, to paint the sorrows and ruin of the Carthusian Fathers, and\r\nthe abbots of Glastonbury and Reading. They ask, \"Is this your boasted\r\nfreedom, to slay these men in cold blood, not for immorality, but\r\nbecause they honestly did not acknowledge what no Protestant of to-day\r\nadmits, viz.: that King Henry was the Supreme Head of the Church?\"\r\nHaving pointed out the exaggerations in the charges against the monks\r\nand having made us weep for the aged fathers of the Charterhouse, they\r\nskillfully lead the unwary to the conclusion that the suppression should\r\nnever have taken place. This conclusion is illogical. The case is\r\nstill open.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if one cared to indulge in historical reminiscences, he\r\nmight justly express astonishment that Rome should object to an\r\ninvestigation conducted by men whose minds were already made up, or that\r\nshe should complain because force was employed to carry out a needed\r\nreform. Did the commissioners take a few altar-cloths and decorate their\r\nhorses? Did Rome never adorn men in garments of shame and parade them\r\nthrough streets to be mocked by the populace, and finally burned at the\r\nstake? Were the altar-cloths dear to Catholic hearts? Were not the\r\nBibles burned in France, in Germany, in Spain, in Holland, in England,\r\ndear to the hearts of the reformers? But however justifiable such a line\r\nof argument may be, there is little to be gained by charging the sins of\r\nthe past against the men of to-day. Nevertheless, if these facts and\r\nmany like them were remembered, less would be said about the cruelties\r\nthat accompanied the suppression of the monasteries.\r\n\r\nWere the charges against the monks true? It seems impossible to doubt\r\nthat in the main they were, although it should be admitted that many\r\nmonasteries were beyond reproach. Eliminating gross exaggerations, lies\r\nand calumnies, there still remains a body of evidence that compels the\r\nverdict of guilt. The legislation of the church councils, the decrees of\r\npopes, the records of the courts, the reports of investigating\r\ncommittees appointed by various popes, the testimony of the orders\r\nagainst each other, the chronicles, letters and other extant literature,\r\nabound in such detailed, specific charges of monastic corruption that it\r\nis simply preposterous to reject the testimony. All the efforts at\r\nreformation, and they were many, had failed. Many bishops confessed\r\ntheir inability to cope with the growing disorders. It is beyond\r\nquestion that lay robbers were encouraged to perpetrate acts of\r\nsacrilege because the monks were frequently guilty of forgery and\r\nviolence. Commenting upon the impression which monkish lawlessness must\r\nhave made upon the minds of such men as Wyclif, Pike says: \"They saw\r\nwith their own eyes those wild and lawless scenes, the faint reflection\r\nof which in contemporaneous documents may excite the wonder of modern\r\nlawyers and modern moralists.\" The legislation of church and state for a\r\ncentury before Henry VIII. shows that the monks were guilty of brawling,\r\nfrequenting taverns, indulging in licentious pleasures and upholding\r\nunlawful games.\r\n\r\nBonaventura, the General of the Franciscan Order in its earliest days,\r\nand its palmiest, for the first years of a monastic order were always\r\nits best years--this mendicant, their pride and their glory, tells us\r\nthat within fifty years of the death of its founder there were many\r\nmendicants roaming around in disorderly fashion, brazen and shameless\r\nbeggars of scandalous fame. This unenviable record was kept up down to\r\nthe days of Wyclif, who charged the begging friars with representing\r\nthemselves as holy and needy, while they were robust of body, rich in\r\npossessions, and dwelt in splendid houses, where they gave sumptuous\r\nbanquets. What shall one say of the hysterical ravings against Henry of\r\nthe \"Holy Maid of Kent,\" whose fits and predictions were palmed off by\r\nfive ecclesiastics, high in authority, as supernatural manifestations?\r\nWhat must have been the state of monasteries in which such meretricious\r\nschemes were hatched, to deceive silly people, thwart the king and stop\r\nthe movements for reform?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the various attempts to reform or to suppress the monasteries\r\nprior to Henry's time show he was simply carrying out what, in a small\r\nway, had been attempted before. King John, Edward I. and Edward III.,\r\nhad confiscated \"alien priories.\" Richard II. and Henry IV. had made\r\nsimilar raids. In 1410, the House of Commons proposed the confiscation\r\nof all the temporalities held by bishops, abbots and priors, that the\r\nmoney might be used for a standing army, and to increase the income of\r\nthe nobles and secular clergy. It was not done, but the attempt shows\r\nthe trend of public opinion on the question of abolishing the\r\nmonasteries. In 1416, Parliament dissolved the alien priories and vested\r\ntheir estates in the crown. There is extant a letter of Cardinal Morton,\r\nLegate of the Apostolic See, and Archbishop of Canterbury, to the abbot\r\nof St. Albans, one of the mightiest abbeys in all England. It was\r\nwritten as the result of an investigation started by Innocent VIII., in\r\n1489. In this communication the abbot and his monks were charged with\r\nthe grossest licentiousness, waste and thieving. Lina Eckenstein, in her\r\ninteresting work on \"Woman Under Monasticism,\" says: \"It were idle to\r\ndeny that the state of discipline in many houses was bad, but the\r\ncircumstances under which Morton's letter was penned argue that the\r\ncharges made in it should be accepted with some reservation.\" In 1523,\r\nCardinal Wolsey obtained bulls from the pope authorizing the suppression\r\nof forty small monasteries, and the application of their revenues to\r\neducational institutions, on the ground that the houses were homes\r\nneither of religion nor of learning.\r\n\r\nWhat Henry did, every country in Europe has felt called upon to do in\r\none way or another. Germany, Italy, Spain, France have all suppressed\r\nmonasteries, and despite the suffering which attended the dissolution in\r\nEngland, the step was taken with less loss of life and less injury to\r\nthe industrial welfare of the people than anywhere else in Europe[J].\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Appendix, Note J.]\r\n\r\nHooper, who was made a bishop in the reign of Edward VI., expressed the\r\nProtestant view of Henry's reforms in a letter written about the year\r\n1546. \"Our king,\" he says, \"has destroyed the pope, but not popery....\r\nThe impious mass, the most shameful celibacy of the clergy, the\r\ninvocation of saints, auricular confession, superstitious abstinence\r\nfrom meats, and purgatory, were never before held by the people in\r\ngreater esteem than at the present moment.\" In other words, the\r\nindependence of the Church of England was secured by those who, if they\r\nwere not Roman Catholics, were certainly closer in faith to Rome than\r\nthey were to Protestantism. The Protestant doctrines did not become the\r\ndoctrines of the Church of England until the reign of Edward VI., and it\r\nwas many years after that before the separation from Rome was complete\r\nin doctrine as well as respects the authority of the pope.\r\n\r\nThese facts indicate that there must have been other causes for the\r\nsuccess of the English Reformation than the greed or ambition of the\r\nmonarch. Those causes are easily discovered. One of them was the\r\nhostility of the people to the alien priories. The origin of the alien\r\npriories dates back to the Norman conquest. The Normans shared the\r\nspoils of their victory with their continental friends. English\r\nmonasteries and churches were given to foreigners, who collected the\r\nrents and other kinds of income. These foreign prelates had no other\r\ninterest in England than to derive all the profit they could from their\r\npossessions. They appointed whom they pleased to live in their houses,\r\nand the monks, being far away from their superiors, became a source of\r\nconstant annoyance to the English people. The struggle against these\r\nalien priories had been carried on for many years, and so many of them\r\nhad been abolished that the people became accustomed to the seizure of\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money were annually paid to the pope, and the English\r\npeople were loudly complaining of the constant drain on their resources.\r\nIt was a common saying in the reign of Henry III., that \"England is the\r\npope's farm.\" The \"Good Parliament,\" in 1376, affirmed \"that the taxes\r\npaid to the church of Rome amounted to five times as much as those\r\nlevied for the king; ... that the brokers of the sinful city of Rome\r\npromoted for money unlearned and unworthy caitiffs to benefices of the\r\nvalue of a thousand marks, while the poor and learned hardly obtain one\r\nof twenty.\" Various laws, heartily supported by the clergy as well as by\r\nthe civil authorities, were enacted from time to time, aimed at the\r\nabuses of papal power. So steadfast and strong was the opposition to the\r\ninterference of foreigners in English affairs, it would be possible to\r\nshow that there was an evolution in the struggle against Rome that was\r\ncertain to culminate in the separation, whether Henry had accomplished\r\nit or not. What might have occurred if the monks had reformed and the\r\npope withdrawn his claims it is impossible to know. The fact is that the\r\nmonks grew worse instead of better, and the arrogance of foreigners\r\nbecame more unendurable. \"The corruption of the church establishment, in\r\nfact,\" says Lea, \"had reached a point which the dawning enlightenment of\r\nthe age could not much longer endure.... Intoxicated with centuries of\r\ndomination, the muttered thunders of growing popular discontent were\r\nunheeded, and its claims to spiritual and temporal authority were\r\nasserted with increasing vehemence, while its corruptions were daily\r\ndisplayed before the people with more careless cynicism.\" In view of\r\nthis condition of affairs, the existence of which even the adherents of\r\nmodern Rome must acknowledge, one cannot but wonder that the ruin of the\r\nmonasteries should be attributed to Henry's desire \"to overthrow the\r\nrights of women, to degrade matrimony and to practice concubinage.\" Such\r\nan explanation is too superficial; it ignores a multitude of\r\nhistorical facts.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries had to fall if England was to be saved from the horrors\r\nof civil war, if the hand of the pope was to remain uplifted from her,\r\nif the insecure gains of the Reformation were to become established and\r\nglorious achievements; if, in fact, all those benefits accompanying\r\nhuman progress were to become the heritage of succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nWhatever benefits the monks had conferred upon mankind, and these were\r\nneither few nor slight, they had become fetters on the advancement of\r\nfreedom, education and true religion. They were the standing army of the\r\npope, occupying the last and strongest citadel. They were the unyielding\r\nadvocates of an ideal that was passing away. It was sad to see the\r\nCarthusian house fall, but in spite of the high character of its\r\ninmates, it was a part of an institution that stood for the right of\r\nforeigners to rule England. It was unfortunate they had thrown\r\nthemselves down before the car of progress but there they were; they\r\nwould not get up; the car must roll on, for so God himself had decreed,\r\nand hence they were crushed in its advance. Their martyrdom was truly a\r\npoor return for their virtues, but there never has been a moral or\r\npolitical revolution that has furthered the general well-being of\r\nhumanity, in which just and good men have not suffered. It would be\r\ndelightful if freedom and progress could be secured, and effete\r\ninstitutions destroyed or reformed, without the accompaniment of\r\ndisaster and death, but it is not so.\r\n\r\nThe monks stood for opposition to reform, and therefore came into direct\r\nconflict with the king, who was blindly groping his way toward the\r\nfuture, and who was, in fact, the unconscious agent of many reform\r\nforces that concentrated in him. He did not comprehend the significance\r\nof his proceedings. He did not take up the cause of the English people\r\nwith the pure and intelligent motive of encouraging free thought and\r\nfree religion. He did not realize that he was leading the mighty army of\r\nProtestant reformers. He little dreamed that the people whose cause he\r\nchampioned would in turn assert their rights and make it impossible for\r\nan English sovereign to enjoy the absolute authority which he wielded.\r\nTruly \"there is a power, not ourselves,\" making for freedom, progress\r\nand truth.\r\n\r\nThus a number of causes brought on the ruin of the monasteries. Henry's\r\nneed of money; the refusal of the monks to sign the acts of supremacy\r\nand succession; the general drift of reform, and the iniquity of the\r\nmonks. They fell from natural causes and through the operation of laws\r\nwhich God alone controls. As Hill neatly puts it, \"Monasticism was\r\nhealthy, active and vigorous; it became idle, listless and extravagant;\r\nit engendered its own corruption, and out of that corruption\r\ncame death.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Bagot, a Catholic, in a recent article on the question, \"Will\r\nEngland become Catholic?\" which was published in the \"Nuova Antologia,\"\r\nsays: \"Though it is impossible not to blame the so-called Reformers for\r\nthe acts of sacrilege and barbarism through which they obtained the\r\nreligious and political liberty so necessary to the intellectual and\r\nsocial progress of the race, it cannot be denied that no sooner had the\r\npower of the papacy come to an end in England than the English nation\r\nentered upon that free development which has at last brought it to its\r\npresent position among the other nations of the world.\" Mr. Bagot also\r\nadmits that \"the political intrigues and insatiable ambition of the\r\npapacy during the succeeding centuries constituted a perpetual menace\r\nto England.\"\r\n\r\nThe true view, therefore, is that two types of religious and political\r\nlife, two epochs of human history, met in Henry's reign. The king and\r\nthe pope were the exponents of conflicting ideals. The fall of the\r\nmonasteries was an incident in the struggle. \"The Catholics,\" says\r\nFroude, \"had chosen the alternative, either to crush the free thought\r\nwhich was bursting from the soil, or to be crushed by it; and the future\r\nof the world could not be sacrificed to preserve the exotic graces of\r\nmedieval saints.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem is reduced to this, Was the Reformation desirable? Is\r\nProtestantism a curse or a blessing? Would England and the world be\r\nbetter off under the sway of medieval religion than under the influence\r\nof modern Protestantism? If monasticism were a fetter on human liberty\r\nand industry, if the monasteries were \"so many seminaries of\r\nsuperstition and of folly,\" there was but one thing to do--to break the\r\nfetters and to destroy the monasteries. To have succeeded in so radical\r\na reform as that begun by King Henry, with forty thousand monks\r\npreaching treason, would have been an impossibility. Henry cannot be\r\nblamed because the monks chose to entangle themselves with politics and\r\nto side with Rome as against the English nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Results of the Dissolution_\r\n\r\nMany important results followed the fall of the monasteries. The\r\nmajority of the House of Lords was now transferred from the abbots to\r\nthe lay peers. The secular clergy, who had been fighting the monks for\r\ncenturies, were at last accorded their proper standing in the church.\r\nNumerous unjust ecclesiastical privileges were swept aside, and in many\r\nrespects the whole church was strengthened and purified. Credulity and\r\nsuperstition began to decline. Ecclesiastical criminals were no longer\r\nable to escape the just penalty for their crimes. Naturally all these\r\nbeneficent ends were not attained immediately. For a while there was\r\ngreat disorder and distress. Society was disturbed not only by the\r\nstoppage of monastic alms-giving, but the wandering monks, unaccustomed\r\nto toil and without a trade, increased the confusion.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is well to point out that some writers make very\r\nmuch of the poverty relieved by the monks, and claim that the nobles,\r\ninto whose hands the monastic lands fell, did almost nothing to mitigate\r\nthe distresses of the unfortunate. But they ignore the fact that a blind\r\nand undiscriminating charity was the cause, and not the cure, of much of\r\nthe miserable wretchedness of the poor. Modern society has learned that\r\nthe monastic method is wholly wrong; that fraud and laziness are\r\nfostered by a wholesale distribution of doles. The true way to help the\r\npoor is to enable the poor to assist themselves; to teach them trades\r\nand give them work. The sociological methods of to-day are thoroughly\r\nanti-monastic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the infidel Zosimus, quoted by Gibbon, was not far\r\nwrong when he said \"the monks robbed an empire to help a few beggars.\"\r\nThe fact that the religious houses did distribute alms and entertain\r\nstrangers is not disputed; indeed it is pleasant to reflect upon this\r\nnoble charity of the monks; it is a bright spot in their history. But it\r\nis in no sense true that they deserve all the credit for relieving\r\ndistress. They received the money for alms in the shape of rents, gifts\r\nand other kinds of income. Hallam says, \"There can be no doubt that many\r\nof the impotent poor derived support from their charity. But the blind\r\neleemosynary spirit inculcated by the Romish church is notoriously the\r\ncause, not the cure, of beggary and wickedness. The monastic\r\nfoundations, scattered in different countries, could never answer the\r\nends of local and limited succor. Their gates might, indeed, be open to\r\nthose who knocked at them for alms.... Nothing could have a stronger\r\ntendency to promote that vagabond mendicity which severe statutes were\r\nenacted to repress.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems almost ungracious to quote such an observation, because it may\r\nbe distorted into a criticism of charity itself, or made to serve the\r\npurposes of certain anti-Romanists who cannot even spare those noble\r\nwomen who minister to the sick in the home or hospital from their\r\nbigoted criticisms. Small indeed must be the soul of that man who\r\npermits his religious opinions to blind his eyes to the inestimable\r\nservices of those heroic and self-sacrificing women. But even Roman\r\nCatholic students of social problems must recognize the folly of\r\nindiscriminate alms-giving. \"In proportion as justice between man and\r\nman has declined, that form of charity which consists in giving money\r\nhas been more quickened.\" The promotion of industry, the repression of\r\ninjustice, the encouragement of self-reliance and thrift, are needed far\r\nmore than the temporary relief of those who suffer from oppression or\r\nfrom their own wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nSome of those who deplore the fall of the monasteries make much of the\r\nfact that the modern world is menaced by materialism. \"With very rare\r\nexceptions,\" cries Maitre, a French Catholic, \"the most undisguised\r\nmaterialism has everywhere replaced the lessons and recollections of the\r\nspiritual life. The shrill voice of machinery, the grinding of the saw\r\nor the monotonous clank of the piston, is heard now, where once were\r\nheard chants and prayers and confessions. Once the monk freely undid\r\nthe door to let the stranger in, and now we see a sign, 'no admittance,'\r\nlest a greedy rival purloin the tricks of trade.\" Montalembert,\r\nreferring to the ruin of the cloisters in France, grieves thus:\r\n\"Sometimes the spinning-wheel is installed under the ancient sanctuary.\r\nInstead of echoing night and day the praises of God, these dishonored\r\narches too often repeat only the blasphemies of obscene cries.\" The\r\nelement of truth in these laments gives them their sting, but one should\r\nbeware of the fervid rhetoric of the worshipers of medievalism. This\r\ncentury is nobler, purer, truer, manlier, and more humane than any of\r\nthe centuries that saw the greatest triumphs of the monks. They, too,\r\nhad their blasphemies, often under the cloak of piety; they, too, had\r\ntheir obscene cries. Their superstitions and frauds concealed beneath\r\nthose \"dishonored arches\" were infinitely worse than the noise of\r\nmachinery weaving garments for the poor, or producing household comforts\r\nto increase the happiness of the humblest man.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is out of joint, much to justify doleful prophecies,\r\nin the social and religious conditions of the present age, but the\r\nsigns of the times are not all ominous. At all events, nothing would be\r\ngained by a return to the monkish ideals of the past. The hope of the\r\nworld lies in the further development and completer realization of those\r\ngreat principles of human freedom that distinguish this century from the\r\npast. The history of monasticism clearly shows that the monasteries\r\ncould not minister to that development of liberty, truth and justice,\r\nwhich constitute the indispensable condition of human happiness and\r\nhuman progress. Unable to adjust themselves to the new age, unwilling to\r\nwelcome the new light, rejecting the doctrine of individual freedom, the\r\nmonks were forced to retire from the field.\r\n\r\nSo fell in England that institution which, for twelve centuries, had\r\nexercised marvelous dominion over the spiritual and temporal interests\r\nof the continent, and for eight hundred years had suffered or thrived on\r\nEnglish soil. \"The day came, and that a drear winter day, when its last\r\nmass was sung, its last censer waved, its last congregation bent in rapt\r\nand lovely adoration before the altar.\" Its majestic and solemn ruins\r\nproclaim its departed grandeur. Its deeds of mercy, its conflicts with\r\nkings and bishops, its prayers and chants and penances, its virtues and\r\nits vices, its trials and its victories, its wealth and its poverty, all\r\nare gone. Silence and death keep united watch over cloister and tomb. We\r\nshould be ungrateful if we forgot its blessings; we should be untrue if,\r\nignoring its evils, we sought to bring back to life that which God has\r\nlaid in the sepulcher of the dead.\r\n\r\n     \"Where pleasant was the spot for men to dwell,\r\n     Amid its fair broad lands the abbey lay,\r\n     Sheltering dark orgies that were shame to tell,\r\n     And cowled and barefoot beggars swarmed the way,\r\n     All in their convent weeds of black, and white, and gray.\r\n\r\n     From many a proud monastic pile, o'erthrown,\r\n     Fear-struck, the brooded inmates rushed and fled;\r\n     The web, that for a thousand years had grown\r\n     O'er prostrate Europe, in that day of dread\r\n     Crumbled and fell, as fire dissolves the flaxen thread.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Bryant_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n_CAUSES AND IDEALS OF MONASTICISM_\r\n\r\nAll forms of religious character and conduct are grounded in certain\r\ncravings of the soul, which, in seeking satisfaction, are influenced by\r\ntheoretical opinions. The longings of the human heart constitute the\r\nimpulse, or the energy, of religion. The intellectual convictions act as\r\nguiding forces. As a religious type, therefore, the monk was produced by\r\nthe action of certain desires, influenced by specific opinions\r\nrespecting God, the soul, the body, the world and their relations.\r\n\r\nThe existence of monasticism in non-Christian religions implies that\r\nwhatever impetus the ascetic impulses in human nature received from\r\nChristian teaching, there is some broader basis for monastic life than\r\nthe tenets of any creed. Biblical history and Christian theology furnish\r\nsome explanation of the rise of Christian monasticism, but they do not\r\naccount for the monks of ancient India. The teachings of Jesus exerted a\r\nprofound influence upon the Christian monks, but they cannot explain the\r\nOriental asceticism that flourished before the Christ of the New\r\nTestament was born. There must have been some motive, or motives,\r\noperating on human nature as such, a knowledge of which will help to\r\naccount for the monks of Indian antiquity as well as the begging friars\r\nof modern times. It will therefore be in order to begin the present\r\ninquiry by seeking those causes which gave rise to monasticism\r\nin general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causative Motives of Monasticism_\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin of religion itself, it is certain that it is man's\r\ninalienable concern. He is, as Sabatier says, \"incurably religious.\" Of\r\nall the motives ministering to this ruling passion, the longing for\r\nrighteousness and for the favor of God is supreme. The savage only\r\npartially grasps the significance of his spiritual aspirations, and\r\ndimly understands the nature of the God he adores or fears. His worship\r\nmay be confined to frantic efforts to ward off the vengeful assaults of\r\nan angry deity, but however gross his religious conceptions, there is at\r\nthe heart of his religion a desire to live in peaceful relations with\r\nthe Supreme Being.\r\n\r\nAs religion advances, the ethical character of God and the nature of\r\ntrue righteousness are more clearly apprehended. But the idea that moral\r\npurity and fellowship with God are in some way associated with\r\nself-denial has always been held by the religious world. But what does\r\nsuch a conception involve? What must one do to deny self? The answer to\r\nthat question will vastly influence the form of religious conduct. Thus\r\nwhile all religious men may unite in a craving for holiness by a\r\nparticipation in the Divine nature, they will differ widely in their\r\nopinions as to the nature of this desirable righteousness and as to the\r\nmeans by which it may be attained. Roman Catholicism, by the voice of\r\nthe monk, whom it regards as the highest type of Christian living, gives\r\none answer to these questions; Protestantism, protesting against\r\nasceticism, gives a different reply.\r\n\r\nThe desire for salvation was, therefore, the primary cause of all\r\nmonasticism. Many quotations might be given from the sacred writings of\r\nIndia, establishing beyond dispute, that underlying the confusing\r\nvariety of philosophical ideas and ascetic practices of the\r\nnon-Christian monks, was a consuming desire for the redemption of the\r\nsoul from sin. Buddha said on seeing a mendicant, \"The life of a devotee\r\nhas always been praised by the wise. It will be my refuge and the refuge\r\nof other creatures, it will lead us to a real life, to happiness and\r\nimmortality.\"\r\n\r\nDharmapala, in expounding the teachings of the Buddha, at the World's\r\nParliament of Religions, in Chicago, clearly showed that the aim of the\r\nBuddhist is \"the entire obliteration of all that is evil,\" and \"the\r\ncomplete purification of the mind.\" That this is the purpose of the\r\nasceticism of India is seen by the following quotation from Dharmapala's\r\naddress: \"The advanced student of the religion of Buddha when he has\r\nfaith in him thinks: 'Full of hindrances is household life, a path\r\ndefiled by passions; free as the air is the life of him who has\r\nrenounced all worldly things. How difficult is it for the man who dwells\r\nat home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity,\r\nin all its perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me\r\nclothe myself in orange-colored robes and let me go forth from a\r\nhousehold life into the homeless state!'\"\r\n\r\nIn the same parliament, Mozoomdar, the brilliant and attractive\r\nrepresentative of the Brahmo Somaj, in describing \"Asia's Service to\r\nReligion,\" thus stated the motives and spirit of Oriental asceticism:\r\n\"What lesson do the hermitages, the monasteries, the cave temples, the\r\ndiscipline and austerities of the religious East teach the world?\r\nRenunciation. The Asiatic apostle will ever remain an ascetic, a\r\ncelibate, a homeless Akinchana, a Fakeer. We Orientals are all the\r\ndescendants of John the Baptist. Any one who has taken pains at\r\nspiritual culture must admit that the great enemy to a devout\r\nconcentration of mind is the force of bodily and worldly desire.\r\nCommunion with God is impossible, so long as the flesh and its lusts are\r\nnot subdued.... It is not mere temperance, but positive asceticism; not\r\nmere self-restraint, but self-mortification; not mere self-sacrifice,\r\nbut self-extinction; not mere morality, but absolute holiness.\" And\r\nfurther on in his address, Mozoomdar claimed that this asceticism is\r\npractically the essential principle in Christianity and the meaning of\r\nthe cross of Christ: \"This great law of self-effacement, poverty,\r\nsuffering, death, is symbolized in the mystic cross so dear to you and\r\ndear to me. Christians, will you ever repudiate Calvary? Oneness of will\r\nand character is the sublimest and most difficult unity with God.\" The\r\nchief value of these quotations from Mozoomdar lies in the fact that\r\nthey show forth the underlying motive of all asceticism. It would be\r\nunjust to the distinguished scholar to imply that he defends those\r\nextreme forms of monasticism which have appeared in India or in\r\nChristian countries. On the contrary, while he maintains, in his\r\ncharming work, \"The Oriental Christ,\" that \"the height of self-denial\r\nmay fitly be called asceticism,\" he is at the same time fully alive to\r\nits dangerous exaggerations. \"Pride,\" he says, \"creeps into the holiest\r\nand humblest exercises of self-discipline. It is the supremest natures\r\nonly that escape. The practice of asceticism therefore is always\r\nattended with great danger.\" The language of Mozoomdar, however, like\r\nthat of many Christian monastic writers, opens the door to many grave\r\nexcesses. It is another evidence of the necessity for defining what one\r\nmeans by \"self-mortification\" and \"self-extinction.\"\r\n\r\nTurning now to Christian monasticism, it will be found that, as in the\r\ncase of Oriental monasticism the yearning for victory over self was\r\nuppermost in the minds of the best Christian monks. A few words from a\r\nletter written by Jerome to Rusticus, a young monk, illustrates the\r\ntruth of this observation: \"Let your garments be squalid,\" he says, \"to\r\nshow that your mind is white, and your tunic coarse, to show that you\r\ndespise the world. But give not way to pride, lest your dress and your\r\nlanguage be found at variance. Baths stimulate the senses, and are\r\ntherefore to be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nTo keep the mind white, to despise the world, to overcome pride, to stop\r\nthe craving of the senses for gratification,--these were the objects of\r\nthe monks, in order to accomplish which they macerated and starved their\r\nbodies, avoided baths, wore rags, affected humble language and fled from\r\nthe scenes of pleasure. The goal was highly commendable, even if the\r\nmeans employed were inadequate to produce the desired results.\r\n\r\nAll down through the Middle Ages, the idea continued to prevail that the\r\nmonastic life was the highest and purest expression of the Christian\r\nreligion, and that the monks' chances of heaven were much better than\r\nthose of any other class of men. The laity believed them to be a little\r\nnearer God than even the clergy, and so they paid them gold for their\r\nprayers. It will readily be understood that in degenerate times, so\r\nprofitable a doctrine would be earnestly encouraged by the monks. The\r\nknight, whose conscience revolted against his conduct but who could not\r\nbring himself to a complete renunciation of the world, believed that\r\nheaven would condone his faults or crimes if in some way he could make\r\nfriends with the dwellers in the cloister. To this end, he founded\r\nabbeys and sustained monasteries by liberal gifts of gold and land. Such\r\na donation was made in the following language: \"I, Gervais, who belong\r\nto the chivalry of the age, caring for the salvation of my soul, and\r\nconsidering that I shall never reach God by my own prayers and fastings,\r\nhave resolved to recommend myself in some other way to those who, night\r\nand day, serve God by these practices, so that, thanks to their\r\nintercession, I may be able to obtain that salvation which I of myself\r\nam unable to merit.\" Another endowment was made by Peter, Knight of\r\nMaull, in these quaint terms: \"I, Peter, profiting by this lesson, and\r\ndesirous, though a sinner and unworthy, to provide for my future\r\ndestiny, I have desired that the bees of God may come to gather their\r\nhoney in my orchards, so that when their fair hives shall be full of\r\nrich combs, they may be able to remember him by whom the hive\r\nwas given.\"\r\n\r\nThe people believed that the prayers of the monks lifted their souls\r\ninto heaven; that their curses doomed them to the bottomless pit. A\r\nmonastery was the safe and sure road to heaven. The observation of\r\nGibbon respecting the early monks is applicable to all of them: \"Each\r\nproselyte who entered the gates of a monastery was persuaded that he\r\ntrod the steep and thorny path of eternal happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe second cause for monasticism in general was a natural love of\r\nsolitude, which became almost irresistible when reinforced by a despair\r\nof the world's redemption. The poet voiced the feelings of almost every\r\nsoul, at some period in life, when he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,\r\n     Some boundless contiguity of shade,\r\n     Where rumor of oppression or deceit,\r\n     Of unsuccessful or successful war,\r\n     Might never reach me more.\"\r\n\r\nThe longing for solitude accompanied the desire for salvation. An\r\nunconquerable weariness of the world, with its strife and passion,\r\novercame the seeker after God. A yearning to escape the duties of social\r\nlife, which were believed to interfere with one's duty to God, possessed\r\nhis soul. The flight from the world was merely the method adopted to\r\nsatisfy his soul-longings. If such times of degeneracy and rampant\r\niniquity ever return, if humanity is again compelled to stagger under\r\nthe moral burdens that crushed the Roman Empire, without doubt the love\r\nof solitude, which is now held in check by the satisfactions of a\r\ncomparatively pure and peaceful social life, will again arise in its\r\nold-time strength and impel men to seek in waste and lonely places the\r\nvirtues they cannot acquire in a decaying civilization.\r\n\r\nEven amid the delights of human fellowship, and surrounded by so much\r\nthat ministers to restfulness of soul, it is often hard to repress a\r\nlonging to shatter the fetters of custom, to flee from the noise and\r\nconfusion of this hurrying, fretful world, and to pass one's days in a\r\ncoveted retirement, far from the maddening strife and tumult.\r\nMontalembert's profound appreciation of monastic life was never more\r\naptly illustrated than in the following declaration: \"In the depths of\r\nhuman nature there exists without doubt, a tendency instinctive, though\r\nconfused and evanescent, toward retirement and solitude. What man,\r\nunless completely depraved by vice or weighed down by care and cupidity,\r\nhas not experienced once, at least, before his death, the attraction of\r\nsolitude?\"\r\n\r\nWhile the motives just described were unquestionably preeminent among\r\nthe causative factors in monasticism, it should not be taken for granted\r\nthat there were no others, or that either or both of these motives\r\ncontrolled every monk. The personal considerations tending to keep up\r\nthe flight from the world were numerous and active. It would be a\r\nmistake to credit all the monks, and at some periods even a majority of\r\nthem, with pure and lofty purposes. Oftentimes criminals were pardoned\r\nthrough the intercession of abbots on condition that they would retire\r\nto a monastery. The jilted lover and the commercial bankrupt, the\r\ndeserted or bereaved wife, the pauper and the invalid, the social\r\noutcast and the shirker of civic duties, the lazy and the fickle were\r\nall to be found in the ranks of the monastic orders. Ceasing to feel any\r\ninterest in the joys of society, they had turned to the cloister as a\r\nwelcome asylum in the hour of their sorrow or disappointment. To some it\r\nwas an easy way out of the struggle for existence, to others it meant an\r\nend to taxes and to military service, to still others it was a haven of\r\nrest for a weary body or a disappointed spirit. Thus many specific,\r\nindividual considerations acted with the general desires for salvation\r\nand solitude to strengthen and to perpetuate the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beliefs Affecting the Causative Motives_\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter it was shown that a variety of views respecting the\r\nrelation of the body and the soul influenced the origin and development\r\nof Christian monasticism. It will not now be necessary to repeat what\r\nwas there said. The essential teaching of all these false opinions was\r\nthat the body was in itself evil, that the gratification of natural\r\nappetites was inherently wrong, and that true holiness consisted in the\r\ncomplete subjection of the body by self-denial and torture. Jerome\r\ndistinctly taught that what was natural was opposed to God. The Gnostics\r\nand many of the early Christians believed that this world was ruled by\r\nthe devil. The Gnostics held that this opposition of the kingdom of\r\nmatter to God was fundamental and eternal. The Christians, however,\r\nmaintained that the antagonism was temporary, the Lord having given the\r\nworld over to evil spirits for a time. The prevailing opinion among\r\nalmost all schools was that a union with God was only possible to those\r\nwho had extinguished bodily desires.\r\n\r\nThe ascetic theory undoubtedly derived much support from the views held\r\nconcerning the teachings of the Bible. The Oriental monks frequently\r\nquoted from their sacred books to justify their habits and ideals. In\r\nlike manner, the Christian monks believed that they, and they alone,\r\nwere literally obeying the commands of Christ and his apostles. This\r\nphase of the subject will receive attention when the three vows of\r\nmonasticism are considered.\r\n\r\nIn the West, two conditions, one political and social, the other\r\nreligious, set in motion all these spiritual desires and ascetic beliefs\r\ntending toward monasticism. One was the corrupted state, of Roman\r\nsociety and the approaching overthrow of the Roman Empire. The other was\r\nthe secularization of the church.\r\n\r\nMen naturally cling to society as long as there exists any well-founded\r\nhope for its regeneration, but when every expectation for the survival\r\nof righteousness yields to a conviction that doom is inevitable, then\r\nthe flight from the world begins. This was precisely the situation in\r\nthe declining days of Rome and Alexandria, when Christian monasticism\r\ncame into being. The monks believed that the end of the world was nigh,\r\nthat all things temporal and earthly were doomed, and that God's hand\r\nwas against the empire. \"That they were correct in their judgment of the\r\nworld about them,\" says Kingsley, \"contemporary history proves\r\nabundantly. That they were correct, likewise, in believing that some\r\nfearful judgment was about to fall on man, is proved by the fact that it\r\ndid fall.\"\r\n\r\nSo they fled to escape being caught in the ruins of society's tottering\r\nstructure,--fled to make friends with the angels and with God. If one\r\ncannot live purely in the midst of corruption, by all means let him live\r\npurely away from corruption, but let him never forget that his piety is\r\nof a lower order than that which abides uncorrupted in the midst of\r\ndegenerate society. There is much truth in the observation of Charles\r\nReade in \"The Cloister and the Hearth\": \"So long as Satan walks the\r\nwhole earth, tempting men, and so long as the sons of Belial do never\r\nlock themselves in caves but run like ants, to and fro corrupting\r\nothers, the good man that sulks apart, plays the Devil's game, or at\r\nleast gives him the odds.\"\r\n\r\nBut the early Christian monks believed that their safety was only in\r\nflight. It was not altogether an unworthy motive; at least it is easy to\r\nsympathize with these men struggling against odds, of the magnitude of\r\nwhich the modern Christian has only the faintest conception.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that the only true and certain way to secure salvation\r\nis by flight from the world, continued to prevail during the succeeding\r\ncenturies of monastic history, and it can hardly be said to have\r\nentirely disappeared even at the present time. Anselm of Canterbury, in\r\nthe twelfth century, wrote to a young friend reminding him that the\r\nglory of this world was perishing. True, not monks only are saved,\r\n\"but,\" says he, \"who attains to salvation in the most certain, who in\r\nthe most noble way, the man who seeks to love God alone, or he who seeks\r\nto unite the love of God with the love of the world?... Is it rational\r\nwhen danger is on every side, to remain where it is the greatest?\"\r\n\r\nThe Christian church set up an ideal of life which it was impossible to\r\nrealize within her borders, and one which differed in many respects from\r\nthe teachings of Jesus. Her demands involved a renunciation of the\r\nworld, a superiority to all the enticements of bodily appetites, a lofty\r\nscorn of secular bonds and social concerns. A vigorous religious faith\r\nhad conquered a mighty empire, but corruption attended its victory. The\r\nstandard of Christian morals was lowered, or had at least degenerated\r\ninto a cold, formal ideal that no one was expected to realize; hence\r\nnone strove to attain it but the monks. When Roman society with its\r\nselfishness, lust and worldliness, swept in through the open doors of\r\nthe church and took possession of the sanctuary, those who had cherished\r\nthe ascetic ideal gave up the fight against the world, and the flight\r\nfrom the world-church began. They could not tolerate this union of the\r\nchurch with a pagan state and an effete civilization. In some respects,\r\nas a few writers maintain, many of these hermits were like the old\r\nJewish prophets, fighting single-handed against corruption in church and\r\nstate, refusing to yield themselves as slaves to the authority of\r\ninstitutions that had forsaken the ideals of the past.\r\n\r\nThus the conviction that the end of human society was nigh, and that the\r\nchurch could no longer serve as an asylum for the lovers of\r\nrighteousness, with certain philosophical ideas respecting the body, the\r\nworld and God, united to produce the assumption that salvation was more\r\nreadily attainable in the deserts; and Christian monasticism, in its\r\nhermit form, began its long and eventful history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Variations in Monasticism_\r\n\r\nProminent among the causes producing variations in the monastic type was\r\nthe influence of climatic conditions and race characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe monasticism as well as the religion of the East has always differed\r\nfrom the monasticism and the religion of the West. The Eastern mind is\r\nmystical, dreamy, contemplative; the Western mind loves activity, is\r\nintensely practical. Representatives of the Eastern faiths in the recent\r\nParliament of Religions accused the West of materialism, of loving the\r\nbody more than the soul. They affected to despise all material\r\nprosperity, and gloried in their assumed superiority, on account of\r\ntheir love for religious contemplation. This radical difference between\r\nthe races of the East and West is clearly seen in the monastic\r\ninstitution. Benedict embodied in his rules the spirit and active life\r\nof the West, and hence, the monastic system, then in danger of dying, or\r\nstagnating, revived and spread all over Europe. Again, the hermit life\r\nwas ill-adapted to the West. Men could not live out of doors in Europe\r\nand subsist on small quantities of food as in Egypt. The rigors of the\r\nclimate in Europe demanded an adaptation to new conditions.\r\n\r\nBut aside from the differences between Eastern and Western monasticism,\r\nthe Christian institution passed through a variety of changes. The\r\ngrowth of monasticism from the hermit stage to the cloistral life has\r\nalready been described. To what shall the development of the community\r\nsystem be attributed? No religious institution can remain stationary,\r\nunaffected by the changing conditions of the society in which it exists.\r\nThe progress of the intellect, and the development of social, political\r\nand industrial conditions, effect great transformations in religious\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe monastic institution grew up amid the radical changes of European\r\nsociety. In its early days it witnessed the invasion of the barbarians,\r\nwhich swept away old political divisions and destroyed many of the\r\nheritages of an ancient civilization. Then the process of reconstruction\r\nslowly began. New states were forming; nations were crystallizing. The\r\nbarbarian was to lay the foundations of great cities and organize\r\npowerful commonwealths out of wild but victorious tribes. The monk\r\ncould not remain in hiding. He was brother to the roving warrior. The\r\nblood in his veins was too active to permit him to stand still amid the\r\nmighty whirl of events. Without entirely abandoning his cloistral life,\r\nhe became a zealous missionary of the church among the barbarians, a\r\npatron of letters and of agriculture, in short a stirring participant in\r\nthe work of civilization.\r\n\r\nNext came the crusades. Jerusalem was to be captured for Christ and the\r\nchurch. The monk then appeared as a crusade-preacher, a warrior on the\r\nbattle-field, or a nurse in the military hospital.\r\n\r\nThe rise of feudalism likewise wrought a change in the spirit and\r\nposition of the monks. The feudal lord was master of his vassals. \"The\r\ngenius of feudalism,\" says Allen, \"was a spirit of uncontrolled\r\nindependence.\" So the abbot became a feudal lord with immense\r\npossessions and powers. He was no longer the obscure, spiritual father\r\nof a little family of monks, but a temporal lord also, an aristocrat,\r\nruling wide territories, and dwelling in a monastery little different\r\nfrom the castle of the knight and often exceeding it in splendor. With\r\nwealth came ease, and hard upon the heels of ease came laziness,\r\narrogance, corruption.\r\n\r\nThen followed the marvelous intellectual awakening, the moral revival,\r\nthe discoveries and inventions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\nThe human mind at last had aroused itself from a long repose, or turned\r\nfrom a profitless activity into broad and fruitful fields. The\r\ncorruption of the monasteries meant the laxity of vows, the cessation of\r\nministration to the poor and the sick. Then arose the tender and loving\r\nFrancis, with his call to poverty and to service. The independent\r\nexercise of the intellect gave birth to heresies, but the Dominicans\r\nappeared to preach them down.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the secular spirit and the progress of the new learning\r\nwere too much for the old monasticism. The monk had to adapt himself to\r\na new age, an age that is impatient of mere contemplation, that spurns\r\nthe rags of the begging friar and rebels against the fierce intolerance\r\nof the Dominican preaching. So, lastly, came the suave, determined,\r\npractical, cultured Jesuit, ready to comply, at least outwardly, with\r\nall the requirements of modern times. Does the new age reject monastic\r\nseclusion? Very well, the Jesuit throws off his monastic garb and\r\nforsakes his cloister, to take his place among men. Are the ignorance\r\nand the filth of the begging friars offensive? The Jesuit is cultured,\r\naffable and spotlessly clean. Does the new age demand liberty?\r\n\"Liberty,\" cries the Jesuit, \"is the divine prerogative, colossal in\r\nproportion, springing straight from the broad basin of the\r\nsoul's essence!\"\r\n\r\nSuch in its merest outlines is the story of the development of the\r\nmonastic type and its causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fundamental Monastic Vows_\r\n\r\nThe ultimate monastic ideal was the purification of the soul, but when\r\ntranslated into definite, concrete terms, the immediate aim of the monk\r\nwas to live a life of poverty, celibacy and obedience. Riches, marriage\r\nand self-will were regarded as forms of sinful gratification, which\r\nevery holy man should abandon. The true Christian, according to\r\nmonasticism, is poor, celibate and obedient. The three fundamental\r\nmonastic vows should therefore receive special consideration.\r\n\r\n1. The Vow of Poverty. The monks of all countries held the possession of\r\nriches to be a barrier to high spiritual attainments. In view of the\r\nfact that an inordinate love of wealth has proved disastrous to many\r\nnations, and that it is extremely difficult for a rich man to escape the\r\nhardening, enervating and corrupting influences of affluence, the\r\nposition of the monks on this question is easily understood. The\r\nChristian monks based their vow of poverty upon the Bible, and\r\nespecially upon the teachings of Christ, who, though he was rich, yet\r\nfor our sakes became poor. He said to the rich young man, \"Sell all that\r\nthou hast and give to the poor.\" In commissioning the disciples to\r\npreach the gospel He said: \"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass\r\nin your purses; nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, nor\r\nshoes.\" In the discourse on counting the cost of discipleship, He said:\r\n\"So therefore, whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he\r\nhath, he cannot be my disciple.\" He promised rewards to \"every one that\r\nleft houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children,\r\nor lands for my name's sake.\" \"It is easier,\" He once said, \"for a\r\ncamel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the\r\nkingdom of heaven.\" He portrayed the pauper Lazarus as participating in\r\nthe joys of heaven, while the rich Dives endured the torments of the\r\nlost. As reported in Luke, He said, \"Blessed are ye poor.\" He Himself\r\nwas without a place to lay His head, a houseless wanderer upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe apostle James cries to the men of wealth: \"Go to now, ye rich men,\r\nweep and howl, for your miseries that shall come upon you.\" John said:\r\n\"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any\r\nman love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever these passages, and many others of like import, may signify, it\r\nis not at all strange that Christians, living in times when wealth was\r\nabused, and when critical Biblical scholarship was unknown, should have\r\nunderstood Christ to command a life of poverty as an indispensable\r\ncondition of true holiness.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of interpreting Christ's doctrine of wealth. First,\r\nit may be held that Jesus intended His teachings to be literally obeyed,\r\nnot only by His first disciples but by all His followers in subsequent\r\nyears, and that such literal obedience is practicable, reasonable and\r\nconducive to the highest well-being of society. Secondly, it has been\r\nsaid that Jesus was a gentle and honest visionary, who erroneously\r\nbelieved that the possession of riches rendered religious progress\r\nimpossible, but that strict compliance with His commands would be\r\ndestructive of civilization. Laveleye declares that \"if Christianity\r\nwere taught and understood conformably to the spirit of its Founder, the\r\nexisting social organism could not last a day.\" Thirdly, neither of\r\nthese views seems to do justice to the spirit of Christ, for they fail\r\nto give proper recognition to many other injunctions of the Master and\r\nto many significant incidents in his public ministry. Exhaustive\r\ntreatment of this subject is, of course, impossible here. Briefly it may\r\nbe remarked, that Jesus looked upon wealth as tending oftentimes to\r\nfoster an unsocial spirit. Rich men are liable to become enemies of the\r\nbrotherhood Jesus sought to establish, by reason of their covetousness\r\nand contracted sympathies. The rich man is in danger of erecting false\r\nstandards of manhood, of ignoring the highest interests of the soul by\r\nan undue emphasis on the material. Wealth, in itself, is not an evil,\r\nbut it is only a good when it is used to advance the real welfare of\r\nhumanity. Jesus was not intent upon teaching economics. His purpose was\r\nto develop the man. It was the moral value and spiritual influence of\r\nmaterial things that concerned him. Professor Shailer Mathews admirably\r\nstates the true attitude of Jesus towards rich men: \"Jesus was a friend\r\nneither of the working man nor the rich man as such. He calls the poor\r\nman to sacrifice as well as the rich man. He was the Son of Man, not the\r\nson of a class of men. But His denunciation is unsparing of those men\r\nwho make wealth at the expense of souls; who find in capital no\r\nincentive to further fraternity; who endeavor so to use wealth as to\r\nmake themselves independent of social obligations, and to grow fat with\r\nthat which should be shared with society;--for those men who are gaining\r\nthe world but are letting their neighbors fall among thieves and Lazarus\r\nrot among their dogs.\"\r\n\r\nJesus was therefore not a foe to rich men as such, but to that\r\nantisocial, abnormal regard for wealth and its procurements, which leads\r\nto the creation of class distinctions and impedes the full and free\r\ndevelopment of our common humanity along the lines of brotherly love and\r\ncoöperation. A Christian may consistently be a rich man, provided he\r\nuses his wealth in furthering the true interests of society, and\r\nrealizes, as respects his own person, that \"a man's life consisteth not\r\nin the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\" The error of\r\nmonasticism consists in making poverty a virtue and an essential\r\ncondition of the highest holiness. It is true that some callings\r\npreclude the prospect of fortune. The average clergyman cannot hope to\r\namass wealth. The resident of a social settlement may possess capacities\r\nthat would win success in business, but he must forego financial\r\nprospects if he expects to live and labor among the poor. In so far as\r\nthe monks deliberately turned their backs on the material rewards of\r\nhuman endeavors that they might be free to devote themselves to the\r\nservice of humanity, their vow of poverty was creditable and reasonable.\r\nBut they erred when they exalted poverty as of itself commending them in\r\na peculiar degree to the mercy of God.\r\n\r\n2. The Vow of Celibacy. \"The moral merit of celibacy,\" says Allen, \"was\r\nharder to make out of the Scripture, doubtless, since family life is\r\nboth at the foundation of civil society and the source of all the common\r\nvirtues.\" The monks held that Christ and Paul both taught and practiced\r\ncelibacy. In the early and middle ages celibacy was looked upon by all\r\nchurchmen as in itself a virtue. The prevailing modern idea is that\r\nmarriage is a holy institution, in no sense inferior in sacredness to\r\nany ecclesiastical order of life. He who antagonizes it plays into the\r\nhands of the foes to social purity and individual virtue.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of Jerome, Ambrose, and all the early Fathers, respecting\r\nmarriage, are still held by many ecclesiastics. One of them, in\r\ndefending the celibacy of existing religious orders, says: \"Celibacy is\r\nenjoined on these religious orders as a means to greater sanctification,\r\ngreater usefulness, greater absorption in things spiritual, and to\r\nfacilitate readier withdrawal from things earthly.\" He gives two reasons\r\nfor the celibacy of the priesthood, which are all the more interesting\r\nbecause they substantially represent the opinions held by the Christian\r\nmonks in all ages: First, \"That the service of the priest to God may be\r\nundivided and unrestrained.\" In support of this, he quotes I. Cor., 7:\r\n32, 33, which reads: \"But I would have you free from cares. He that is\r\nunmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the\r\nLord: but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how\r\nhe may please his wife.\" And secondly, \"Celibacy,\" according to Trent,\r\n\"is more blessed than marriage.\" He also quotes the words of Christ that\r\nthere are \"eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" He then adds: \"It\r\nis desirable that those called to the ministry of the altar espouse a\r\nlife of continence because holier and more angelic.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that the vow of celibacy was not demanded of\r\nthe clergy in primitive Christian times. It was only after many years of\r\nbitter debate and in response to the growing influence of the monastic\r\nideal, that celibacy finally came to be looked upon as the highest form\r\nof Christian virtue, and was enforced upon the clergy. As in the case of\r\nthe vow of poverty, there certainly can be no reasonable objection to\r\nthe individual adoption of celibacy, if one is either disinclined to\r\nmarriage or feels that he can do better work unmarried. But neither\r\nScripture nor reason justifies the imposition of celibacy upon any man,\r\nnor the view that a life of continence is holier than marriage. It may\r\nbe reverently said that God would be making an unreasonable demand upon\r\nmankind, if the holiness He requires conflicted with the proper\r\nsatisfaction of those impulses He himself has deeply implanted in\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\n3. The Vow of Obedience. The monks were required to render absolute\r\nobedience to the will of their superiors, as the representatives of God.\r\nDom Guigo, in his rules for the Carthusian Order, declares: \"Moreover,\r\nif the Prior commands one of his religious to take more food, or to\r\nsleep for a longer time, in fact, whatever command may be given us by\r\nour Superior, we are not allowed to disobey, lest we should disobey God\r\nalso, who commands us by the mouth of our Superior. All our practices of\r\nmortification and devotion would be fruitless and of no value, without\r\nthis one virtue of obedience, which alone can make them acceptable\r\nto God.\"\r\n\r\nThus a strict and uncomplaining obedience, not to the laws of God as\r\ninterpreted by the individual conscience, but to the judgment and will\r\nof a brother man, was demanded of the monks.\r\n\r\n     \"Theirs not to reason why,\r\n     Theirs not to make reply,\r\n     Theirs but to do and die.\"\r\n\r\nThey were often severely beaten or imprisoned and sometimes mutilated\r\nfor acts of disobedience. While the monks, especially the Friars and\r\nJesuits, carried this principle of obedience to great extremes, yet in\r\nthe barbarous ages its enforcement was sadly needed. Law and order were\r\nwords which the untamed Goth could not comprehend. He had to be taught\r\nhabits of obedience, a respect for the rights of others, and a proper\r\nappreciation of his duty to society for the common good. But while, at\r\nthe beginning, the monastic vow of obedience helped to inculcate these\r\ndesirable lessons, and vastly modified the ferocity of unchecked\r\nindividualism, it tended, in the course of time, to generate a servile\r\nhumility fatal to the largest and freest personal development. In the\r\ninterests of passive obedience, it suppressed freedom of thought and\r\naction. Obedience became mechanical and unreasoning. The consequence was\r\nthat the passion for individual liberty was unduly restrained, and the\r\nextravagant claims of political and ecclesiastical tyrants were greatly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nSuch was the monastic ideal and such were some of the means employed to\r\nrealize it. The ascetic spirit manifests itself in a great variety of\r\nways, but all these visible and changing externals have one common\r\nsource. \"To cherish the religious principle,\" says William E. Channing,\"\r\nsome have warred against their social affections, and have led solitary\r\nlives; some against their senses, and have abjured all pleasure in\r\nasceticism; some against reason, and have superstitiously feared to\r\nthink; some against imagination, and have foolishly dreaded to read\r\npoetry or books of fiction; some against the political and patriotic\r\nprinciples, and have shrunk from public affairs,--all apprehending that\r\nif they were to give free range to their natural emotions their\r\nreligious life would be chilled or extinguished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n_THE EFFECTS OF MONASTICISM_\r\n\r\n\"We read history,\" said Wendell Phillips, \"not through our eyes but\r\nthrough our prejudices.\" Yet if it were possible entirely to lay aside\r\none's prepossessions respecting monastic history, it would still be no\r\neasy task to estimate the influences of the monks upon human life.\r\n\r\nIn every field of thought and activity monasticism wrought good and\r\nevil. Education, industry, government and religion have been both\r\nfurthered and hindered by the monks. What Francis Parkman said of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church is true of the monastic institution: \"Clearly she\r\nis of earth, not of heaven; and her transcendently dramatic life is a\r\ntype of the good and ill, the baseness and nobleness, the foulness and\r\npurity, the love and hate, the pride, passion, truth, falsehood,\r\nfierceness, and tenderness, that battle in the restless heart of man.\"\r\n\r\nA careful and sympathetic survey of monastic history compels the\r\nconclusion that monasticism, while not uniformly a blessing to the\r\nworld, was not an unmitigated evil. The system presents one long series\r\nof perplexities and contradictions. One historian shuts his eyes to its\r\npernicious effects, or at least pardons its transgressions, on the\r\nground that perfection in man or in institutions is unattainable.\r\nAnother condemns the whole system, believing that the sum of its evils\r\nfar outweighs whatever benefits it may have conferred upon mankind.\r\nSchaff cuts the Gordian knot, maintaining that the contradiction is\r\neasily solved on the theory that it was not monasticism, as such, which\r\nhas proved a blessing to the Church and the world. \"It was Christianity\r\nin monasticism,\" he says, \"which has done all the good, and used this\r\nabnormal mode of life as a means of carrying forward its mission of love\r\nand peace.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the diversities of opinion on this subject, and\r\nincidentally to show how difficult it is to present a well-balanced,\r\nsymmetrically fair and just estimate of the monastic institution as a\r\nwhole, contrast the opinions of four celebrated men. Pius IX. refers to\r\nthe, monks as \"those chosen phalanxes of the army of Christ which have\r\nalways been the bulwark and ornament of the Christian republic as well\r\nas of civil society.\" But then he was the Pope of Rome, the Arch-prelate\r\nof the Church. \"Monk,\" fiercely demands Voltaire, \"Monk, what is that\r\nprofession of thine? It is that of having none, of engaging one's self\r\nby an inviolable oath to be a fool and a slave, and to live at the\r\nexpense of others.\" But he was the philosophical skeptic of Paris.\r\n\"Where is the town,\" cries Montalembert, \"which has not been founded or\r\nenriched or protected by some religious community? Where is the church\r\nwhich owes not to them a patron, a relic, a pious and popular tradition?\r\nWherever there is a luxuriant forest, a pure stream, a majestic hill, we\r\nmay be sure that religion has left there her stamp by the hand of the\r\nmonk.\" But this was Montalembert, the Roman Catholic historian, and the\r\navowed champion of the monks. \"A cruel, unfeeling temper,\" writes\r\nGibbon, \"has distinguished the monks of every age and country; their\r\nstern indifference, which is seldom mollified by personal friendship,\r\nis inflamed by religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has\r\nstrenuously administered the holy office of the Inquisition.\" But this\r\nwas Gibbon, the hater of everything monastic. Between these extreme\r\nviews lies a wide field upon which many a deathless duel has been fought\r\nby the writers of monastic history.\r\n\r\nThe variety of judgments respecting the nature and effects of\r\nmonasticism is partly due to the diversity in the facts of its history.\r\nMonasticism was the friend and the foe of true religion. It was the\r\ninspiration of virtue and the encouragement of vice. It was the patron\r\nof industry and the promoter of idleness. It was a pioneer in education\r\nand the teacher of superstition. It was the disburser of alms and a\r\nmany-handed robber. It was the friend of human liberty and the abettor\r\nof tyranny. It was the champion of the common people and the defender of\r\nclass privileges. It was, in short, everything that man was and is, so\r\nvaried were its operations, so complex was its influence, so\r\ncomprehensive was its life.\r\n\r\nOf some things we may be certain. Any religious institution or ideal of\r\nlife that has survived the changes of twelve centuries, and that has\r\nenlisted the enthusiastic services and warmest sympathies of numerous\r\nmen and women who have been honorably distinguished for their\r\nintellectual attainments and moral character, must have possessed\r\nelements of truth and moral worth. A contemptuous treatment of\r\nmonasticism implies either an ignorance of its real history or a wilful\r\ndisregard of the deep significance of its commendable features.\r\n\r\nIt is also certain that while the methods of monasticism, judged by\r\ntheir effects upon the individual and upon society, may be justly\r\ncensured, it is beyond question that many monks, groping their way\r\ntoward the light in an age of ignorance and superstition, were inspired\r\nby the purest motives. \"Conscience,\" observes Waddington, \"however\r\nmisguided, cannot be despised by a reflecting mind. When it leads one to\r\nself-sacrifice and moral fortitude we cannot but admire his spirit,\r\nwhile we condemn his sagacity and method.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effects of Self-Sacrifice Upon the Individual_\r\n\r\nChristianity requires some sort of self-denial as the condition of true\r\nChristian discipleship. Self-love is to yield to a love of others. In\r\nsome sense, the Christian is to become dead to the world and its\r\ndemoralizing pleasures. But this primal demand upon the soul needs to be\r\ninterpreted. What is it to love the world? What is it to keep the body\r\nin subjection? What are harmful indulgences? To give wrong answers to\r\nthese questions is to set up a false ideal; the more strenuously such\r\nfalse ideal is followed, the more disastrous are the consequences. One's\r\nstruggle for moral purity may end in failure, and one's efficiency for\r\ngood may be seriously impaired by a perversion of the principle of\r\nself-abnegation. Unnatural severity and excessive abstinence often\r\nproduce the opposite effect from that intended. Instead of a peaceful\r\nmind there is delirium, and instead of freedom from temptation there are\r\na thousand horrible fiends hovering in the air and ready, at any moment,\r\nto pounce upon their prey. \"The history of ascetics,\" says Martensen,\r\n\"teaches us that by such overdone fasting the fancy is often excited to\r\nan amazing degree, and in its airy domain affords the very things that\r\none thought to have buried, by means of mortification, a magical\r\nresurrection.\" In attempting to subdue the body, many necessary\r\nrequirements of the physical organism were totally ignored. The body\r\nrebelled against such unnatural treatment, and the mind, so closely\r\nrelated to it, in its distraction, gave birth to the wildest fancies.\r\nMen, who would have possessed an ordinarily pure mind in some useful\r\noccupation of life, became the prey of the most lewd and obnoxious\r\nimaginations. Then they fancied themselves vile above their fellows, and\r\nlaid on more stripes, put more thorns upon their pillows, and fasted\r\nmore hours, only to find that instead of fleeing, the devils became\r\nblacker and more numerous.\r\n\r\nSelf-forgetfulness is the key to happiness. The monk thought otherwise,\r\nand slew himself in his vain attempt to fight against nature. He never\r\nlifted his eyes from his own soul. He was always feeling his spiritual\r\npulse, staring at his lean spiritual visage, and tearfully watching his\r\ngrowth in grace. An interest in others and a strong mind in a strong\r\nbody are the best antidotes to religious despair and the temptations of\r\nthe soul. Life in the monastery was generally less severe than in the\r\ndesert's solitude. There was more and better food, shelter, and comfort,\r\nbut there were many unnecessary and unnatural restrictions, even in the\r\nbest days of monasticism. There were too many hours of prayer, too many\r\nneedless regulations for silence, fasting and penance, to produce a\r\nhealthy, vigorous type of religious life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effects of Solitude Upon the Individual_.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that some solitude is essential to our richest\r\nculture. Our higher nature demands time for reflection and meditation.\r\nBut the monks carried this principle to an extreme, and they\r\noverestimated its benefits. \"Ambition, avarice, irresolution, fear, and\r\ninordinate desires,\" says Montaigne, \"do not leave us because we forsake\r\nour native country, they often follow us even to cloisters and\r\nphilosophical schools; nor deserts, nor caves, nor hair shirts, nor\r\nfasts, can disengage us from them.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these passions, which the monks carried with them, their\r\nsolitary life tended to foster spiritual pride, contract sympathy, and\r\nengender an inhumane spirit. True, there were exceptions; but the\r\nsublime characters which survive in monastic history are by no means\r\ntypical of its usual effects. Seclusion did not benefit the average\r\nmonk. Indeed there is something wanting in even the loftiest monastic\r\ncharacters. \"The heroes of monasticism,\" says Allen, \"are not the heroes\r\nof modern life. All put together, they would not furnish out one such\r\nsoul as William of Orange, or Gustavus, or Milton. Independence of\r\nthought and liberty of conscience, they renounced once for all, in\r\ntaking upon them the monastic vow. All the larger enterprises, all the\r\nbroad humanities, which to our mind make a greater career, were rigidly\r\nshut off by a barrier that could not be crossed. All the warmth and\r\nwealth of social and domestic life was a field of forbidden fruit, to be\r\nentered only through the gate of unpardonable sin.\"\r\n\r\nThus self-excluded from a normal life in society, often the subject of\r\nself-inflicted pain, it is no wonder that the monk impaired all the\r\nnobler and manlier feelings of the soul, that he became strangely\r\nindifferent to human affection, that bigotry and pride often sat as\r\njoint rulers on the throne of his heart. He who had trampled on all\r\nfilial relations would scarcely recognize the bonds of human\r\nbrotherhood. He who heard not the prayer of his own mother would not be\r\nlikely to listen to the cry of the tortured heretic for mercy. Man as\r\nman was not reverenced. It was the monk in man who was esteemed. As\r\nMilman puts it, \"Bigotry has always found its readiest and sternest\r\nexecutioners among those who have never known the charities of life.\"\r\n\r\nNor is it a matter of surprise that the monk was spiritually proud. He\r\nwas supposed to stand in the inner circle, a little nearer the throne of\r\nGod than his fellow-mortals. When dead, he was worshiped as a saint and\r\nregarded as an intercessor between God and his lower fellow-creatures.\r\nHis hatred of the base world easily passed over into a sense of\r\nsuperiority and ignoble pride.\r\n\r\n\"True social life,\" says Martensen, \"leads to solitude.\" This truth the\r\nmonks emphasized to the exclusion of the converse, \"true life in\r\nsolitude leads back to society.\" John Tauler, the mystic monk, realized\r\nthis truth when he said: \"If God calls me to a sick person, or to the\r\nservice of preaching, or to any other service of love, I must follow,\r\nalthough I am in the state of highest contemplation.\" The hermits of the\r\ndesert, and too often the monks of the cloister, escaped from all such\r\nservices, and selfishly gave themselves up to saving their own souls by\r\ncontemplation and prayer. Ministration to the needy is the external side\r\nof the inner religious life. It is the fruit of faith and prayer. The\r\nmonk sought solitude, not for the purpose of fitting himself for a place\r\nin society, but for selfish, personal ends. Saint Bruno, in a letter to\r\nhis friend Ralph le Verd, eulogizes the solitude of the monastic cell,\r\nand among other sentiments he gives expression to the following: \"I am\r\nspeaking here of the contemplative life; and although its sons are less\r\nnumerous than those of active life, yet, like Joseph and Benjamin, they\r\nare infinitely dearer to their Father.... O my brother, fear not then to\r\nfly from the turmoil and the misery of the world; leave the storms that\r\nrage without, to shelter yourself in this safe haven.\"\r\n\r\nThus sinful and sorrowing humanity, needing the guidance and comfort\r\nthat holy men can furnish, was forgotten in the desire for personal\r\npeace and future salvation.\r\n\r\nAnother baneful result of isolation was the strangulation of filial\r\nlove. When the monk abandoned the softening, refining influence of women\r\nand children, one side of his nature suffered a serious contraction. An\r\nEgyptian mother stood at the hut of two hermits, her sons. Weeping\r\nbitterly, she begged to see their faces. To her piteous entreaties, they\r\nsaid: \"Why do you, who are already stricken with age, pour forth such\r\ncries and lamentations?\" \"It is because I long to see you,\" she replied.\r\n\"Am I not your mother? I am now an old and wrinkled woman, and my heart\r\nis troubled at the sound of your voices.\" But even a mother's love could\r\nnot cope with their fearful fanaticism., and she went away with their\r\ncold promise that they would meet in heaven. St. John of Calama visited\r\nhis sister in disguise, and a chronicler, telling the story afterwards,\r\nsaid, \"By the mercy of Jesus Christ he had not been recognized, and they\r\nnever met again.\" Many hermits received their parents or brothers and\r\nsisters with their eyes shut. When the father of Simeon Stylites died,\r\nhis widowed mother prayed for entrance into her son's cell. For three\r\ndays and nights she stood without, and then the blessed Simeon prayed\r\nthe Lord for her, and she immediately gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nThese as well as numerous other stories of a similar character that\r\nmight be quoted illustrate the hardening influence of solitude. Instead\r\nof cherishing a love of kindred, as a gift of heaven and a spring of\r\nvirtue, the monk spurned it and trampled it beneath his feet as an\r\nobstacle to his spiritual progress. \"The monks,\" says Milman, \"seem\r\nalmost unconscious of the softening, humanizing effect of the natural\r\naffections, the beauty of parental tenderness and filial love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Monks as Missionaries_\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the barbarians was an indispensable condition of\r\nmodern civilization. Every step forward had to be taken in the face of\r\nbarbaric ignorance and cruelty. In this stupendous undertaking the monks\r\nled the way, displaying in their labors remarkable generalship and\r\nundaunted courage. Whatever may be thought of later monasticism, the\r\nBenedictine monks are entitled to the lasting gratitude of mankind for\r\ntheir splendid services in reducing barbaric Europe to some sort of\r\norder and civilization. But again the mixture of good and evil is\r\nstrangely illustrated. It seems impossible to accord the monks\r\nunqualified praise. The potency of the evil tendencies within their\r\nsystem vitiated every noble achievement. Their methods and practical\r\nideals were so at variance with the true order of nature that every\r\ncommendable victory involved a corresponding obstacle to real social and\r\nreligious progress. The justice of these observations will be more\r\napparent as this inquiry proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monasticism and Civic Duties_\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of a considerable number of men of character and talent\r\nfrom the exercise of civic duties is injurious to the state. The burdens\r\nupon those who remain become heavier, while society is deprived of the\r\nmoral influence of those who forsake their civic responsibilities. When\r\nthe monk, from the outside as it were, attempted to exert an influence\r\nfor good, he largely failed. His ideals of life were not formulated in a\r\nreal world, but in an artificial, antisocial environment. He was unable\r\nto appreciate the political needs of men. He could not enter\r\nsympathetically into their serious employments or innocent delights.\r\nControlled by superstition, and exalting a servile obedience to human\r\nauthority, he became a very unsafe guide in political affairs. He could\r\nnot consistently labor for secular progress, because he had forsaken a\r\nworld in which secular interests were prominent.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that in the early days of monasticism the monks pursued\r\nthe proper course in refusing to become Roman patriots. No human power\r\ncould have averted the ruin which overtook that corrupt world. Perhaps\r\ntheir non-combatant attitude gave them more influence with the\r\nconquerors of Rome, who were to become the founders of modern nations.\r\n\r\nIn later years, the abbots of the principal monasteries occupied seats\r\nin the legislative assemblies of Germany, Hungary, Spain, England,\r\nItaly, and France. In many instances they stood between the violence of\r\nthe nobles and the unprotected vassal. Political monks, inspired by a\r\nnatural breadth of vision and a love of humanity, secured the passage of\r\nwise and humane regulations. Palgrave says: \"The mitre has resisted many\r\nblows which would have broken the helmet, and the crosier has kept more\r\nfoes in awe than the lance. It is, then, to these prelates that we\r\nchiefly owe the maintenance of the form and spirit of free government,\r\nsecured to us, not by force, but by law; and the altar has thus been the\r\ncorner-stone of our ancient constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there is much truth in the foregoing observation, yet on the\r\nother hand, when the influence of the monastic ideal upon civilization\r\nis studied in its deeper aspects, it cannot be justly maintained that\r\nthe final effects of monasticism minister to the development of a normal\r\ncivilization. Industrial, mental and moral progress depend upon a\r\ncertain breadth of mind and energy of soul. Asceticism saps the vitality\r\nof human nature and confines the activity of the mind within artificial\r\nlimits. \"Hence the dreary, sterile torpor,\" says Lecky, \"that\r\ncharacterized those ages in which the ascetic principle has been\r\nsupreme, while the civilizations which have attained the highest\r\nperfection have been those of ancient Greece and modern Europe, which\r\nwere most opposed to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe monks did not hesitate to become embroiled in military quarrels, or\r\nto incite the fiercer passions of men when it suited their purpose.\r\nTheir opposition to kings and princes was often not based on a love of\r\npopular freedom, but on an indisposition to share power with secular\r\nrulers. The legislative enactments against heretics, many of which they\r\ninspired, clearly show that they neither desired nor tolerated liberty\r\nof speech or conduct. They were the Almighty's vicars on earth, before\r\nwhom it was the duty of king and subject to bow down. Vaughan writes of\r\nthe period just prior to the Reformation: \"The great want was freedom\r\nfrom ecclesiastical domination; and from the feeling of the hour,\r\nscarcely any price would be deemed too great to be paid for that\r\nobject.\" The history of modern Jesuitism, against which the legislation\r\nof almost every civilized nation has been directed, affords abundant\r\ntestimony to the inherent hostility of the monastic system, even in its\r\nmodified modern form, to every species of government which in any way\r\nguarantees freedom of thought to its people. This stern fact confronts\r\nthe student, however much he may be inclined to yield homage to the\r\nearly monks. It must be held in mind when one reads this pleasing\r\nsentence from Macaulay: \"Surely a system which, however deformed by\r\nsuperstition, introduced strong moral restraints into communities\r\npreviously governed only by vigor of muscle and by audacity of spirit, a\r\nsystem which taught the fiercest and mightiest ruler that he was, like\r\nhis meanest bondman, a responsible being, might have seemed to deserve a\r\nmore respectful mention from philosophers and philanthropists.\"\r\n\r\nThe general effect of monasticism on the state is, therefore, not to be\r\ndetermined by fixing the gaze on any one century of its history, or by\r\nholding up some humane and patriotic monk as a representative product of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Agricultural Services of the Monks_\r\n\r\nEurope must ever be indebted to Benedict and his immediate followers for\r\ntheir services in reclaiming waste lands, and in removing the stigma\r\nwhich a corrupt civilization had placed upon labor. Benedict came before\r\nthe world saying: \"No person is ever more usefully employed than when\r\nworking with his hands or following the plough, providing food for the\r\nuse of man.\" Care was taken that councils should not be called when\r\nploughing was to be done or wheat to be threshed. Benedict bent himself\r\nto the task of teaching the rich and the proud, the poor and the lazy\r\nthe alphabet of prosperity and happiness. Agriculture was at its lowest\r\nebb. Marshes covered once fertile fields, and the men who should have\r\ntilled the land spurned the plough as degrading, or were too indolent to\r\nundertake the tasks of the farm. The monks left their cells and their\r\nprayers to dig ditches and plough fields. The effect was magical. Men\r\nonce more turned back to a noble but despised industry. Peace and plenty\r\nsupplanted war and poverty. \"The Benedictines,\" says Guizot, \"have been\r\nthe great clearers of land in Europe. A colony, a little swarm of monks,\r\nsettled in places nearly uncultivated, often in the midst of a pagan\r\npopulation--in Germany, for example, or in Brittany; there, at once\r\nmissionaries and laborers, they accomplish their double service, through\r\nperil and fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that history throws a shadow across this pleasing\r\nscene. When labor came to be recognized as honorable and useful, along\r\ncame the begging friars, creating, both by precept and example, a\r\nprejudice against labor and wealth. Rags and laziness came to be\r\nassociated with holiness, and a beggar monk was held up as an ideal and\r\nsacred personage. \"The spirit that makes men devote themselves in vast\r\nnumbers,\" says Lecky, \"to a monotonous life of asceticism and poverty is\r\nso essentially opposed to the spirit that creates the energy and\r\nenthusiasm of industry, that their continued coexistence may be regarded\r\nas impossible.\" But such a fatal mistake could not long captivate the\r\nmind, or cause men to forget Benedict and his industrial ideal. The\r\nblessings of wealth rightly administered, and the dignity of labor\r\nwithout which wealth is impossible, came to be recognized as necessary\r\nfactors in the true progress of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Monks and Secular Learning_\r\n\r\nFor many centuries, as has been previously shown, the monks were the\r\nschoolmasters of Europe. They also preserved the manuscripts of the\r\nclassics, produced numerous theological works, transmitted many pious\r\ntraditions, and wrote some interesting and some worthless chronicles.\r\nThey laid the foundations of several great universities, including those\r\nof Paris, Oxford and Cambridge. For these, and other valuable services,\r\nthe monks merit the praise of posterity. It is, however, too much to\r\naffirm, as Montalembert does, that \"without the monks, we should have\r\nbeen as ignorant of our history as children.\" It is altogether\r\nimprobable that the human mind would have been unproductive in the field\r\nof historical writing had monasticism not existed during the middle\r\nages. While, also, the monks should be thanked for preserving the\r\nclassics, it should not be supposed that all knowledge of Latin and\r\nGreek literature would have perished but for them.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that the literary men of the medieval period should\r\nhave written so little of interest to the modern mind, or that helps us\r\nto an understanding of the momentous events amid which they lived.\r\nUnfortunately the monkish mind was concentrated upon a theology, the\r\npremises of which have been largely set aside by modern science. Their\r\nwritings are so permeated by grotesque superstitions that they are\r\npractically worthless to-day. Their hostility to secular affairs blinded\r\nthem to the tremendous significance of the mighty political and social\r\nmovements of the age.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that the monks never encouraged a love of secular\r\nlearning. They did not try to impart a love of the classics which they\r\npreserved. The spirit of monasticism was ever at war with true\r\nintellectual progress. The monks imprisoned Roger Bacon fourteen years,\r\nand tried to blast his fair name by calling him a magician, merely\r\nbecause he stepped beyond the narrow limits of monkish inquiry. Many\r\nsuffered indignities, privations or death for questioning tradition or\r\nfor conducting scientific researches.\r\n\r\nSo while it is true that the monks rendered many services to the cause\r\nof education, it is also true that their monastic theories tended to\r\nnarrow the scope of intellectual activity. \"This,\" says Guizot, \"is the\r\nfoundation of their instruction; all was turned into commentary of the\r\nScriptures, historical, philosophical, allegorical, moral commentary.\r\nThey desired only to form priests; all studies, whatsoever their nature,\r\nwere directed to this result.\" There was no disinterested love of\r\nlearning; no desire to become acquainted with God's world. In fact, the\r\nold hostility to everything natural characterizes all monastic history.\r\nEurope did not enter upon that broad and noble intellectual development\r\nwhich is the glory of our era, until the right arm of monasticism was\r\nstruck down, the dread of heresy banished from the human mind, and\r\nsecular learning welcomed as a legitimate and elevated field for\r\nmental activity.\r\n\r\nHamilton W. Mabie, in his delightful essay on \"Some Old Scholars,\"\r\ndescribes this step from the gloom of the cloister to the light of God's\r\nworld: \"Petrarch really escaped from a sepulcher when he stepped out of\r\nthe cloister of medievalism, with its crucifix, its pictures of\r\nunhealthy saints, its cords of self-flagellation, and found the heavens\r\nclear, beautiful, and well worth living under, and the world full of\r\ngood things which one might desire and yet not be given over to evil. He\r\nventured to look at life for himself and found it full of wonderful\r\ndignity and power. He opened his Virgil, brushed aside the cobwebs which\r\nmonkish brains had spun over the beautiful lines, and met the old poet\r\nas one man meets another; and lo! there arose before him a new,\r\nuntrodden and wholly human world, free from priestcraft and pedantry,\r\nnear to nature and unspeakably alluring and satisfying.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans and Jesuits set their faces like flint against all\r\neducation tending to liberalize the mind. Here is a passage from a\r\ndocument published by the Jesuits at their first centenary: \"It is\r\nundeniable that we have undertaken a great and uninterrupted war in the\r\ninterests of the Catholic church against heresy. Heresy need never hope\r\nthat the society will make terms with it, or remain quiescent ... No\r\npeace need be expected, for the seed of hatred is born within us. What\r\nHamilcar was to Hannibal, Ignatius is to us. At his instigation, we have\r\nsworn upon the altars eternal war.\" When this proclamation is read in\r\nthe light of history, its meaning stands forth with startling clearness.\r\nAlmost every truth in science and philosophy, no matter how valuable it\r\nwas destined to become as an agent in enhancing the well-being of the\r\nrace, has had to wear the stigma of heresy.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting speculation to imagine what the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of Europe would have been, had secular learning been\r\ncommended by the monks, and the common people encouraged to exercise\r\ntheir minds without fear of excommunication or death. It is sad to\r\nreflect how many great thoughts must have perished still-born in the\r\nstudent's cloister cell, and to picture the silent grief with which\r\nmany a brilliant soul must have repressed his eager imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Charity of the Monks_\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century, a monk named Thieffroy wrote the following: \"It\r\nmatters little that our churches rise to heaven, that the capitals of\r\ntheir pillars are sculptured and gilded, that our parchment is tinted\r\npurple, that gold is melted to form the letters of our manuscripts, and\r\nthat their bindings are set with precious stones, if we have little or\r\nno care for the members of Christ, and if Christ himself lies naked and\r\ndying before our doors.\" This spirit, so charmingly expressed, was never\r\nquite absent from the monkish orders. The monasteries were asylums for\r\nthe hungry during famines, and the sick during plagues. They served as\r\nhotels where the traveler found a cordial welcome, comfortable shelter\r\nand plain food. If he needed medical aid, his wants were supplied.\r\nDuring the black plague, while many monks fled with the multitude,\r\nothers stayed at their posts and were to be found daily in the homes of\r\nthe stricken, ministering to their bodily and spiritual needs. Many of\r\nthem perished in their heroic and self-sacrificing labors.\r\n\r\nAlms-giving was universally enjoined as a sure passport to heaven. The\r\nmost glittering rewards were held out to those who enriched the monks\r\nwith legacies to be used in relief of the poor. It was, no doubt, the\r\nunselfish activities of the monks that caused them to be held in such\r\nhigh esteem; the result was their coffers were filled with more gold\r\nthan they could easily give away. Thus abuses grew up. Bernard said:\r\n\"Piety gave birth to wealth, and the daughter devoured the mother.\"\r\nJacob of Vitry complained that money, \"by various and deceptive tricks,\"\r\nwas exacted from the people by the monks, most of which adhered \"to\r\ntheir unfaithful fingers.\" While Lecky eloquently praises the monks for\r\ntheir beautiful deeds of charity, \"following all the windings of the\r\npoor man's grief,\" still he condones in the strongest terms the action\r\nof Henry VIII. in transferring the monastic funds to his own treasury:\r\n\"No misapplication of this property by private persons could produce as\r\nmuch evil as an unrestrained monasticism.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust, however, to censure the monks for not recognizing\r\nthe evil social effects of indiscriminate alms-giving. While their\r\nsystem was imperfect, it was the only one possible in an age when the\r\nsocial sciences were unknown. It is difficult, even to-day, to restrain\r\nthat good-natured, but baneful, benevolence which takes no account of\r\ncircumstances and consequences, and often fosters the growth of\r\npauperism. The monks kept alive that sweet spirit of philanthropy which\r\nis so essential to all the higher forms of civilization. It is easier to\r\ndiscover the proper methods for the exercise of generous sentiments,\r\nthan to create those feelings or to arouse them when dormant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monasticism and Religion_\r\n\r\nNo doctrine in theology, or practice of religion, has been free from\r\nmonastic influences. An adequate treatment of this theme would require\r\nvolumes instead of paragraphs. A few points, however, may be touched\r\nupon by way of suggestion to those who may wish to pursue the\r\nsubject further.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the monastic ideal was to emphasize the sinfulness of man\r\nand his need of redemption. To get rid of sin--that is the problem of\r\nhumanity. A quaint formula of monastic confession reads: \"I confess all\r\nthe sins of my body, of my flesh, of my bones and sinews, of my veins\r\nand cartilages, of my tongue and lips, of my ears, teeth and hair, of my\r\nmarrow and any other part whatsoever, whether it be soft or hard, wet or\r\ndry.\" This emphasis on man's sinfulness and the need of redemption was\r\nsadly needed in Rome and all down the ages. \"It was a protest,\" says\r\nClarke, \"against pleasure as the end of life ... It proved the reality\r\nof the religious sentiment to a skeptical age.... If this long period of\r\nself-torture has left us no other gain, let us value it as a proof that\r\nin man religious aspiration is innate, unconquerable, and able to\r\ntriumph over all that the world hopes and over all that it fears.\"\r\n\r\nThus the monks helped to keep alive the enthusiasm of religion. There\r\nwas a fervor, a devotion, a spirit of sacrifice, in the system, which\r\nacted as a corrective to the selfish materialism of the early and middle\r\nages. Christian history furnishes many sad spectacles of brutality and\r\nlicentiousness, of insolent pride and uncontrolled greed, masked in the\r\ngarb of religion. Monasticism, by its constant insistence upon poverty\r\nand obedience, fostered a spirit of loyalty to Christ and the cross,\r\nwhich served as a protest, not only against the general laxity of\r\nmorals, but also against the faithlessness of corrupt monks. Harnack\r\nsays: \"It was always monasticism that rescued the church when sinking,\r\nfreed her when secularized, defended her when attacked. It warmed hearts\r\nthat were growing cold, restrained unruly spirits, won back the people\r\nwhen alienated from the church.\" It may have been in harmony with divine\r\nplans, that religion was to have been kept alive and vigorous by\r\nexcessive austerities, even as in later days it needed the stern and\r\nunyielding Puritan spirit, now regarded as too grim and severe, to cope\r\nsuccessfully with the forces of tyranny and sin.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as some are inclined to believe, that this age is losing\r\na definite consciousness of sin, that in the reaction from the\r\nasceticism of the monks and the gloom of the Puritans we are in danger\r\nof minimizing the doctrine of personal accountability to God, then we\r\ncannot afford to ignore the underlying ideal of monasticism. In so far\r\nas monasticism contributed to a normal consciousness of human freedom\r\nand personal guilt, and maintained a grip upon the conscience of the\r\nsinner, it has rendered the cause of true religion a genuine and\r\npermanent service.\r\n\r\nBut the mistake of the monks was twofold. They exaggerated sin, and they\r\nemployed unhealthy methods to get rid of it. Excessive introspection,\r\ninstead of exercising a purifying influence, tends to distort one's\r\nreligious conceptions, and creates an unwholesome type of piety. Man is\r\na sinner, but he also has potential and actual goodness. The monks\r\nfailed to define sin in accordance with facts. Many innocent pleasures\r\nand legitimate satisfactions were erroneously thought to be sinful.\r\nHonorable and useful aspirations that, under wise control, minister to\r\nman's highest development were selected for eradication. \"Every instinct\r\nof human nature,\" says W.E. Channing, \"has its destined purpose in life,\r\nand the perfect man is to be found in the proportionate cultivation of\r\neach element of his character, not in the exaggerated development of\r\nthose faculties which are deemed primarily good, nor in the repression\r\nof those which are evil only when their prominence destroys the balance\r\nof the whole.\"\r\n\r\nBut the methods employed by the monks to get rid of sin afford another\r\nillustration of the fact that noble sentiments and holy aspirations need\r\nto be wisely directed. It is not enough for a mother to love her child;\r\nshe must know how to give that love proper expression. In her attempt to\r\nguide and train her loved one she may fatally mislead him. The modern\r\nemphasis upon method deserves wider recognition than it has received.\r\n\r\nThe applause of the church that sounded so sweet in the ears of the\r\nmonk, as he laid the stripes upon his body, proclaims the high esteem in\r\nwhich penance was held. But the monk cruelly deceived himself. His\r\nself-inflicted tortures developed within his soul an unnatural piety, \"a\r\npiety,\" says White, \"that became visionary and introspective, a theology\r\nof black clouds and lightning and thunder, a superstitious religion\r\nbased on dreams and saint's bones.\" True penitence consists in high and\r\nholy purposes, in pure and unselfish living, and not in disfigurements\r\nand in misery. Dreariness and fear are not the proper manifestations of\r\nthat perfect love which casteth out fear.\r\n\r\nThe influence of monasticism upon the doctrine of atonement for sin\r\nwas, in many respects, prejudicial to the best interests of religion.\r\nThe monks are largely responsible for the theory that sin can be atoned\r\nfor by pecuniary gifts. It may be said that they did not ignore true\r\nfeelings of repentance, of which the gold was merely a tangible\r\nexpression, but the notion widely prevailed that the prayers of the\r\nmonks, purchased by temporal gifts, secured the forgiveness of the\r\ntransgressor. The worship of saints, pilgrimages to shrines, and\r\nreverence for bones and other relics, were assiduously encouraged.\r\n\r\nThus the monkish conception of salvation and of the means by which it is\r\nto be obtained were at variance with any reasonable interpretation of\r\nthe Scriptures and the dictates of human reason. \"It measured virtue,\"\r\nsays Schaff, \"by the quantity of outward exercises, instead of the\r\nquality of the inward disposition, and disseminated self-righteousness\r\nand an anxious, legal, and mechanical religion[K].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: Appendix, Note K.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of future punishment reached its most repulsive and\r\nabnormal developments in the hands of the monks. A vast literature was\r\nproduced by them, portraying, with vivid minuteness, the pangs of hell.\r\nVolcanoes were said to be the portals of the lower world, that heaved\r\nand sighed as human souls were plunged into the awful depths. God was\r\nheld up as a fearful judge, and the saving mercy of Christ himself paled\r\nbefore the rescuing power of his mother. These fearful caricatures of\r\nGod, these detailed, revolting descriptions of pain and anguish, could\r\nnot but have a hardening effect upon the minds of men. \"To those,\" says\r\nLecky, \"who do not regard these teachings as true, it must appear\r\nwithout exception, the most odious in the religious history of the\r\nworld, subversive of the very foundations of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the greatest error of monastic teaching was in its false and\r\nbaneful distinction between the secular and the religious.\r\nUnquestionably the Christian ideal is founded on some form of\r\nworld-renunciation. The teachings and example of Jesus, the lives of the\r\nApostles, and the characters of the early Christians, exhibit in varying\r\nphases the ideal of self-crucifixion. The doctrine of the cross, with\r\nall that it signifies, is the most powerful force in the spread of\r\nChristianity. The spiritual nature of man needs to be trained and\r\ndisciplined. But does this truth lead the Christian to the monastic\r\nmethod? Was the self-renunciation of Jesus like that of the ascetics,\r\nwith their ecstasies and self-punishments? Is God more pleased with the\r\nrecluse who turns from a needy world to shut himself up to prayer and\r\nmeditation, than He is with him who cultivates holy emotions and\r\nheavenly aspirations, while pursuing some honorable and useful calling?\r\nThe answer to these questions discloses the chief fallacy in the\r\nmonastic ideal, the effect of which was the creation of an artificial\r\npiety. There is no special virtue in silence, celibacy, and abstinence\r\nfrom the enjoyment of God's gifts to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe crying need of Christianity to-day is a willingness on the part of\r\nChrist's followers to live for others instead of self. Men and women are\r\nneeded who, like many of the monks and nuns, will identify themselves\r\nwith the toiling multitudes, and who will forego the pleasures of the\r\nworld and the prospects of material gain or social preferment, for the\r\nsake of ministering to a needy humanity. The essence of Christianity is\r\na love to God and man that expresses itself in terms of social service\r\nand self-sacrifice. Monasticism helped to preserve that noble essence\r\nof all true religion. But a revival of the apostolic spirit in these\r\ntimes would not mean a triumph for monasticism. Stripped of its rigid\r\nvows of celibacy, poverty and obedience, monasticism is dead.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of social service, the insistence upon soul-purity, and the\r\ncraving for participation in the divine nature, are the fruits of\r\nChristianity, not of monasticism, which merely sought to carry out the\r\nChristian ideal. But it is not necessary, in order to realize this\r\nideal, to wage war on human nature. True Christianity is perfectly\r\ncompatible with wealth, health and social joys. The realms of industry,\r\npolitics and home-life are a part of God's world. A religious ideal\r\nbased on a distorted view of social life, that involves a renunciation\r\nof human joy and the extinction of natural desires, and that prohibits\r\nthe free exercise of beneficent faculties, as conditions of its\r\nrealization, can never establish its right to permanent and universal\r\ndominion. The faithful discharge of unromantic, secular duties, the\r\nkeeping of one's heart pure in the midst of temptation, and the\r\nunheralded altruism of private life, must ever be as welcome in the\r\nsight of God as the prayers of the recluse, who scorns the world of\r\nsecular affairs.\r\n\r\nTrue religion, the highest religion, is possible beyond the walls of\r\nchurches and convents. The so-called secular employments of business and\r\npolitics, of home and school, may be conducted in a spirit of lofty\r\nconsecration to the Eternal, and so carried on, may, in their way,\r\nminister to the highest welfare of humanity. The old distinction,\r\ntherefore, between the secular and the sacred is pernicious and false.\r\nThere are some other sacred things besides monasteries and prayers.\r\nHuman life itself is holy; so are the commonplace duties of the untitled\r\nhousehold and factory saints.\r\n\r\n     \"God is in all that liberates and lifts,\r\n     In all that humbles, sweetens, and consoles.\"\r\n\r\nModern monasticism has forsaken the column of St. Simeon Stylites and\r\nthe rags of St. Francis. It has given up the ancient and fantastic feats\r\nof asceticism, and the spiritual extravagances of the early monks. The\r\nold monasticism never could have arisen under a religious system\r\ncontrolled by natural and healthful spiritual ideas. It has no\r\nattractions for minds unclouded by superstition. It has lost its hold\r\nupon the modern man because the ancient ideas of God and his world, upon\r\nwhich it thrived, have passed away.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the effects of the monastic institution. Its history is\r\nat once a warning and an inspiration. Its dreamy asceticism, its gloomy\r\ncells, are gone. Its unworldly motives, its stern allegiance to duty,\r\nits protest against self-indulgence, its courage and sincerity, will\r\never constitute the potent energy of true religion. Its ministrations to\r\nthe broken-hearted, and its loving care of the poor, must ever remain as\r\na shining example of practical Christianity. In the simplicity of the\r\nmonk's life, in the idea of \"brotherhood,\" in the common life for common\r\nends, a Christian democracy will always find food for reflection. As the\r\nsocial experiments of modern times reveal the hidden laws of social and\r\nreligious progress, it will be found that in spite of its glaring\r\ndeficiencies, monasticism was a magnificent attempt to realize the ideal\r\nof Christ in individual and social life. As such it merits neither\r\nridicule nor obloquy. It was a heroic struggle with inveterate ignorance\r\nand sin, the history of which flashes many a welcome light upon the\r\nproblems of modern democracy and religion.\r\n\r\nMonastic forms and vows may pass away with other systems that will have\r\ntheir day, but its fervor of faith, and its warfare against human\r\npassion and human greed, its child-like love of the heavenly kingdom\r\nwill never die. The revolt against its superstitions and excesses is\r\njustifiable only in a society that seeks to actualize its underlying\r\nreligious ideal of personal purity and social service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nNOTE A\r\n\r\nThe derivation and meaning of a few monastic terms may be of interest to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nAbbot, from [Greek: abba], literally, father. A title originally given\r\nto any monk, but afterwards restricted to the head or superior of a\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nAnchoret, anchorite, from the Greek, [Greek: anachorêtês], a recluse,\r\nliterally, one retired. In the classification of religious ascetics, the\r\nanchorets were those who were most excessive in their austerities, not\r\nonly choosing solitude but subjecting themselves to the greatest\r\nprivations.\r\n\r\nAscetic, [Greek: askêtês], one who exercises, an athlete. The term was\r\nfirst applied to those practicing self-denial for athletic purposes. In\r\nits ecclesiastical sense, it denotes those who seek holiness through\r\nself-mortification.\r\n\r\nCanon Regular. About A.D. 755, Chrodegangus, Bishop of Metz, gave a\r\ncloister-life law to his clergy, who came to be called canons, from\r\n[Greek: kanôn], rule. The canons were originally priests living in a\r\ncommunity like monks, and acting as assistants to the bishops. They\r\ngradually formed separate and independent bodies. Benedict XII. (1399)\r\ntried to secure a general adoption of the rule of Augustine for these\r\ncanons, which gave rise to the distinction between canons regular (i.e.,\r\nthose who follow that rule), and canons secular (those who do not).\r\n\r\nCenobite, from the Greek, [Greek: koinos], common, and [Greek: bios],\r\nlife; applied to those living in monasteries.\r\n\r\nClerks Regular. This is a title given to certain religious orders\r\nfounded in the sixteenth century. The principal societies are: the\r\nTheatines, founded by Cajetan of Thiene, subsequently Pope Paul IV.;\r\nand Priests of the Oratory, instituted by Philip Neri, of Florence.\r\nThese two orders have been held in high repute, numbering among their\r\nmembers many men of rank and intellect.\r\n\r\nCloister, from the Latin, _Claustra_, that which closes or shuts, an\r\ninclosure; hence, a place of religious retirement, a monastery.\r\n\r\nHermit, or eremite, from the Greek, [Greek: herêmos], desolate,\r\nsolitary. One who dwells alone apart from society, or with but few\r\ncompanions. Not used of those who dwell in cloisters.\r\n\r\nMonastery, comes from the same source as monk. Commonly applied to a\r\nhouse used exclusively by monks. The term, however, strictly includes\r\nthe abbey, the priory, the nunnery, the friary, and in this broad sense\r\nis synonymous with convent, which is from the Latin, _convenire_, to\r\nmeet together.\r\n\r\nMonk, from the Greek, [Greek: mhonos], alone, single. Originally, a man\r\nwho retired from the world for religious meditation. In later use, a\r\nmember of a community. It is used indiscriminately to denote all persons\r\nin monastic orders, in or out of the monasteries.\r\n\r\nNun, from _nouna_, i.e., chaste, holy. \"The word is probably of Coptic\r\norigin, and occurs as early as in Jerome.\" (Schaff).\r\n\r\nRegulars. Until the tenth century it was not customary to regard the\r\nmonks as a part of the clerical order. Before that time they were known\r\nas _religiosi_ or _regulares_. Afterwards a distinction was made between\r\nparish priests, or secular clergy, and the monks, or regular clergy.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information on these and other monastic words, see The\r\nCentury Dictionary and Cyclopedia, and McClintock and Strong's\r\nEncyclopedia.\r\n\r\nNOTE B\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans are likened to the Jesuits probably on account of their\r\nsubmission to Pythagoras as Master, their love of learning and their\r\nausterities. Like the Jesuits, the Pythagorean league entangled itself\r\nwith politics and became the object of hatred and violence. Its\r\nmeeting-houses were everywhere sacked and burned. As a philosophical\r\nschool Pythagoreanism became extinct about the middle of the\r\nfourth century.\r\n\r\nNOTE C\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopædia Brittanica divides the monastic institutions into five\r\nclasses:\r\n\r\n1. Monks. 2. Canons Regular. 3. Military Orders. 4. Friars. 5. Clerks\r\nRegular. All of these have communities of women, either actually\r\naffiliated to them, or formed on similar lines.\r\n\r\nSaint Benedict distinguishes four sorts of monks: 1. Coenobites, living\r\nunder an abbot in a monastery. 2. Anchorites, who retire into the\r\ndesert. 3. Sarabaites, dwelling two or three in the same cell. 4.\r\nGyrovagi, who wander from monastery to monastery. The last two kinds he\r\ncondemns. The Gyrovagi or wandering monks were the pest of convents and\r\nthe disgrace of monasticism. They evaded all responsibilities and spent\r\ntheir time tramping from place to place, living like parasites, and\r\nspreading vice and disorder wherever they went.\r\n\r\nThere were really four distinct stages in the development of the\r\nmonastic institution:\r\n\r\n1. Asceticism. Clergy and laymen practiced various forms of self-denial\r\nwithout becoming actual monks.\r\n\r\n2. The hermit life, which was asceticism pushed to an external\r\nseparation from the world. Here are to be found anchorites, and stylites\r\nor pillar-saints.\r\n\r\n3. Coenobitism, or monastic life proper, consisting of associations of\r\nmonks under one roof, and ruled by an abbot.\r\n\r\n4. Monastic orders, or unions of cloisters, the various abbots being\r\nunder the authority of one supreme head, who was, at first, generally\r\nthe founder of the brotherhood.\r\n\r\nUnder this last division are to be classed the Mendicant Friars, the\r\nMilitary Monks, the Jesuits and other modern organizations. The members\r\nof these orders commenced their monastic life in monasteries, and were\r\ntherefore coenobites, but many of them passed out of the cloister to\r\nbecome teachers, preachers or missionary workers in various fields.\r\n\r\nNOTE D\r\n\r\nMatins. One of the canonical hours appointed in the early church, and\r\nstill observed in the Roman Catholic Church, especially in monastic\r\norders. It properly begins at midnight. The name is also applied to the\r\nservice itself, which includes the Lord's Prayer, the Angelic\r\nSalutation, the Creed and several psalms.\r\n\r\nLauds, a religious service in connection with matins; so called from the\r\nreiterated ascriptions of praise to God in the psalms.\r\n\r\nPrime. The first hour or period of the day; follows after matins and\r\nlauds; originally intended to be said at the first hour after sunrise.\r\n\r\nTierce, terce. The third hour; half-way between sunrise and noon.\r\n\r\nSext. The sixth hour, originally and properly said at midday.\r\n\r\nNone, noon. The ninth hour from sunrise, or the middle hour between\r\nmidday and sunset--that is, about 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nVespers, the next to the last of the canonical hours--the even-song.\r\n\r\nCompline. The last of the seven canonical hours, originally said after\r\nthe evening meal and before retiring to sleep, but in later medieval and\r\nmodern usage following immediately on vespers.\r\n\r\nB.V.M.--Blessed Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nNOTE E\r\n\r\nThe literary and educational services of the monks are described in many\r\nhistories, but the reader will find the best treatment of this subject\r\nin the scholarly yet popular work of George Haven Putnam, \"Books and\r\nTheir Makers During the Middle Ages,\" to which we are largely indebted\r\nfor the facts given in this volume.\r\n\r\nNOTE F\r\n\r\nIn many interesting particulars St. Francis may be compared with General\r\nBooth of the Salvation Army. In their intense religious fervor, in their\r\ninsistence upon obedience, humility, and self-denial, in their services\r\nfor the welfare of the poor, in their love of the \"submerged tenth,\"\r\nthey are alike. True, there are no monkish vows in the Salvation Army\r\nand its doctrines bear a general resemblance to those of other\r\nProtestant communions, but like the old Franciscan order, it is\r\ndominated by a powerful missionary spirit, and its members are actuated\r\nby an unsurpassed devotion to the common people. In the autocratic,\r\nmilitary features of the Army, it more nearly approaches the ideal of\r\nLoyola. It is quite possible that the differences between Francis and\r\nBooth are due more to the altered historical environment than to any\r\nradical diversities in the characters of the two men.\r\n\r\nNOTE G\r\n\r\nThe quotations from Father Sherman are taken from an address delivered\r\nby him in Central Music Hall, Chicago, Illinois, on Monday, February 5,\r\n1894, in which he extolled the virtues of Loyola and defended the aims\r\nand character of the Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\nNOTE H\r\n\r\nThose who may wish to study the casuistry of the Jesuits, as it appears\r\nin their own works, are referred to two of the most important and\r\ncomparatively late authorities: Liguori's \"_Theologia Moralis_,\" and\r\nGury's \"_Compendium Theologioe Moralis_\" and \"_Casus Conscientiæ_.\" Gury\r\nwas Professor of Moral Theology in the College Romain, the Jesuits'\r\nCollege in Rome. His works have passed through several editions. They\r\nwere translated from the Latin into French by Paul Bert, member of the\r\nChamber of Deputies. An English translation of the French rendering was\r\npublished by B.F. Bradbury, of Boston, Massachusetts. The reader is also\r\nreferred to Pascal's \"Provincial Letters\" and to Migne's \"_Dictionnaire\r\nde cas de Conscience_.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE I\r\n\r\nThe student may profitably study the life and teachings of Wyclif in\r\ntheir bearing upon the destruction of the monasteries. Wyclif was\r\ndesignated as the \"Gospel Doctor\" because he maintained that \"the law\r\nof Jesus Christ infinitely exceeds all other laws.\" He held to the right\r\nof private judgment in the interpretation of Scripture, and denied the\r\ninfallibility claimed by the pontiffs. He opposed pilgrimages, held\r\nloosely to image-worship and rejected the system of tithing as it was\r\nthen carried on. Wyclif was also a persistent and public foe of the\r\nmendicant friars. The views of this eminent reformer were courageously\r\nadvocated by his followers, and for nearly two generations they\r\ncontinued to agitate the English people. It is easy to understand,\r\ntherefore, how Wyclif's opinions assisted in preparing the nation for\r\nthe Reformation of the sixteenth century, although it seemed that\r\nLollardy had been everywhere crushed by persecution. The Lollards\r\ncondemned, among other things, pilgrimages to the tombs of the saints,\r\npapal authority and the mass. Their revolt against Rome led in some\r\ninstances to grave excesses.\r\n\r\nNOTE J\r\n\r\nIn France, the religious houses suppressed by the laws of February 13,\r\n1790, and August 18, 1792, amounted (without reckoning various minor\r\nestablishments) to 820 abbeys of men and 255 of women, with aggregate\r\nrevenues of 95,000,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty Years' War in Germany wrought much mischief to the\r\nmonasteries. On the death of Maria Theresa, in 1780, Joseph II., her\r\nson, dissolved the Mendicant Orders and suppressed the greater number of\r\nmonasteries and convents in his dominions.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pope Alexander VII. secured the suppression of many small\r\ncloisters in Italy, he was in favor of a still wider abolition on\r\naccount of the superfluity of religious institutes, and the general\r\ndegeneration of the monks. Various minor suppressions had taken place in\r\nItaly, but it was not until the unification of the kingdom that the\r\nreligious houses were declared national property. The total number of\r\nmonasteries suppressed in Italy, down to 1882, was 2,255, involving an\r\nenormous displacement of property and dispersion of inmates.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the religious houses in Spain dates from the law of June 21,\r\n1835, which suppressed nine hundred monasteries at a blow. The remainder\r\nwere dissolved on October 11th, in the same year.\r\n\r\nNo European country had so many religious houses in proportion to its\r\npopulation and area as Portugal. In 1834 the number suppressed\r\nexceeded 500.\r\n\r\nNOTE K\r\n\r\nThe criticism of Schaff is just in its estimate of the general influence\r\nof the monastic ideal, but there were individual monks whose views of\r\nsin and salvation were singularly pure and elevating. Saint Hugh, of\r\nLincoln, said to several men of the world who were praising the lives of\r\nthe Carthusian monks: \"Do not imagine that the kingdom of Heaven is only\r\nfor monks and hermits. When God will judge each one of us, he will not\r\nreproach the lost for not having been monks or solitaries, but for not\r\nhaving been true Christians. Now, to be a true Christian, three things\r\nare necessary; and if one of these three things is wanting to us, we are\r\nChristians only in name, and our sentence will be all the more severe,\r\nthe more we have made profession of perfection. The three things are:\r\n_Charity in the heart, truth on the lips, and purity of life_; if we are\r\nwanting in these, we are unworthy of the name of Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE
