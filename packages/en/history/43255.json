Divers reasons dictated a change of plan. Of one only need I\r\nspeak. I knew that Mr Round was on the eve of giving to the world his\r\n_Feudal England_, and that thereby he would teach me and others many new\r\nlessons about the scheme and meaning of Domesday Book. That I was well\r\nadvised in waiting will be evident to everyone who has studied his work.\r\nIn its light I have suppressed, corrected, added much. The delay has\r\nalso enabled me to profit by Dr Meitzen's _Siedelung und Agrarwesen der\r\nGermanen_[1], a book which will assuredly leave a deep mark upon all our\r\ntheories of old English history.\r\n\r\nThe title under which I here collect my three Essays is chosen for the\r\npurpose of indicating that I have followed that retrogressive method\r\n'from the known to the unknown,' of which Mr Seebohm is the apostle.\r\nDomesday Book appears to me, not indeed as the known, but as the\r\nknowable. The Beyond is still very dark: but the way to it lies through\r\nthe Norman record. A result is given to us: the problem is to find cause\r\nand process. That in some sort I have been endeavouring to answer Mr\r\nSeebohm, I can not conceal from myself or from others. A hearty\r\nadmiration of his _English Village Community_ is one main source of\r\nthis book. That the task of disputing his conclusions might have fallen\r\nto stronger hands than mine I well know. I had hoped that by this time\r\nProf. Vinogradoff's _Villainage in England_ would have had a sequel.\r\nWhen that sequel comes (and may it come soon) my provisional answer can\r\nbe forgotten. One who by a few strokes of his pen has deprived the\r\nEnglish nation of its land, its folk-land, owes us some reparation. I\r\nhave been trying to show how we can best bear the loss, and abandon as\r\nlittle as may be of what we learnt from Dr Konrad von Maurer and Dr\r\nStubbs.\r\n\r\nFor my hastily compiled Domesday Statistics I have apologized in the\r\nproper place. Here I will only add that I had but one long vacation to\r\ngive to a piece of work that would have been better performed had it\r\nbeen spread over many years. Mr Corbett, of King's College, has already\r\nshown me how by a little more patience and ingenuity I might have\r\nobtained some rounder and therefore more significant figures. But of\r\nthis it is for him to speak.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends whom I wish to thank for their advice and assistance I\r\nam more especially grateful to Mr Herbert Fisher, of New College, who\r\nhas borne the tedious labour of reading all my sheets, and to Mr W. H.\r\nStevenson, of Exeter College, whose unrivalled knowledge of English\r\ndiplomatics has been generously placed at my service.\r\n\r\n                                                  F. W.

The outcome\r\nof that speech was the mission throughout all England of 'barons,'\r\n'legates' or 'justices' charged with the duty of collecting from the\r\nverdicts of the shires, the hundreds and the vills a _descriptio_ of his\r\nnew realm. The outcome of that mission was the _descriptio_ preserved\r\nfor us in two manuscript volumes, which within a century after their\r\nmaking had already acquired the name of Domesday Book. The second of\r\nthose volumes, sometimes known as Little Domesday, deals with but three\r\ncounties, namely Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, while the first volume\r\ncomprehends the rest of England. Along with these we must place certain\r\nother documents that are closely connected with the grand inquest. We\r\nhave in the so-called Inquisitio Comitatus Cantabrigiae, a copy, an\r\nimperfect copy, of the verdicts delivered by the Cambridgeshire jurors,\r\nand this, as we shall hereafter see, is a document of the highest value,\r\neven though in some details it is not always very trustworthy[2]. We\r\nhave in the so-called Inquisitio Eliensis an account of the estates of\r\nthe Abbey of Ely in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and other counties, an\r\naccount which has as its ultimate source the verdicts of the juries and\r\nwhich contains some particulars which were omitted from Domesday\r\nBook[3]. We have in the so-called Exon Domesday an account of Cornwall\r\nand Devonshire and of certain lands in Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire;\r\nthis also seems to have been constructed directly or indirectly out of\r\nthe verdicts delivered in those counties, and it contains certain\r\nparticulars about the amount of stock upon the various estates which are\r\nomitted from what, for distinction's sake, is sometimes called the\r\nExchequer Domesday[4]. At the beginning of this Exon Domesday we have\r\ncertain accounts relating to the payment of a great geld, seemingly the\r\ngeld of six shillings on the hide that William levied in the winter of\r\n1083-4, two years before the deep speech at Gloucester[5]. Lastly, in\r\nthe Northamptonshire Geld Roll[6] we have some precious information\r\nabout fiscal affairs as they stood some few years before the survey[7].\r\n\r\n[Domesday and legal history.]\r\n\r\nSuch in brief are the documents out of which, with some small help from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon dooms and land-books, from the charters of Norman kings\r\nand from the so-called Leges of the Conqueror, the Confessor and Henry\r\nI., some future historian may be able to reconstruct the land-law which\r\nobtained in the conquered England of 1086, and (for our records\r\nfrequently speak of the _tempus Regis Edwardi_) the unconquered England\r\nof 1065. The reflection that but for the deep speech at Gloucester, but\r\nfor the lucky survival of two or three manuscripts, he would have known\r\nnext to nothing of that law, will make him modest and cautious. At the\r\npresent moment, though much has been done towards forcing Domesday Book\r\nto yield its meaning, some of the legal problems that are raised by it,\r\nespecially those which concern the time of King Edward, have hardly been\r\nstated, much less solved. It is with some hope of stating, with little\r\nhope of solving them that we begin this essay. If only we can ask the\r\nright questions we shall have done something for a good end. If English\r\nhistory is to be understood, the law of Domesday Book must be mastered.\r\nWe have here an absolutely unique account of feudalism in two different\r\nstages of its growth, the more trustworthy, though the more puzzling,\r\nbecause it gives us particulars and not generalities.\r\n\r\nPuzzling enough it certainly is, and this for many reasons. Our task may\r\nbe the easier if we state some of those reasons at the outset.\r\n\r\n[Domesday a geld book.]\r\n\r\nTo say that Domesday Book is no collection of laws or treatise on law\r\nwould be needless. Very seldom does it state any rule in general terms,\r\nand when it does so we shall usually find cause for believing that this\r\nrule is itself an exception, a local custom, a provincial privilege.\r\nThus, if we are to come by general rules, we must obtain them\r\ninductively by a comparison of many thousand particular instances. But\r\nfurther, Domesday Book is no register of title, no register of all those\r\nrights and facts which constitute the system of land-holdership. One\r\ngreat purpose seems to mould both its form and its substance; it is a\r\ngeld-book.\r\n\r\n[Danegeld.]\r\n\r\nWhen Duke William became king of the English, he found (so he might well\r\nthink) among the most valuable of his newly acquired regalia, a right to\r\nlevy a land-tax under the name of geld or danegeld. A detailed history\r\nof that tax cannot be written. It is under the year 991 that our English\r\nchronicle first mentions a tribute paid to the Danes[8]; £10,000 was\r\nthen paid to them. In 994 the yet larger sum of £16,000[9] was levied.\r\nIn 1002 the tribute had risen to £24,000[10], in 1007 to £30,000[11], in\r\n1009 East Kent paid £3,000[12]; £21,000 was raised in 1014[13]; in 1018\r\nCnut when newly crowned took £72,000 besides £11,000 paid by the\r\nLondoners[14]; in 1040 Harthacnut took £21,099 besides a sum of £11,048\r\nthat was paid for thirty-two ships[15]. With a Dane upon the throne,\r\nthis tribute seems to have become an occasional war-tax. How often it\r\nwas levied we cannot tell; but that it was levied more than once by the\r\nConfessor is not doubtful[16]. We are told that he abolished it in or\r\nabout the year 1051, some eight or nine years after his accession, some\r\nfifteen before his death. No sooner was William crowned than 'he laid on\r\nmen a geld exceeding stiff.' In the next year 'he set a mickle geld' on\r\nthe people. In the winter of 1083-4 he raised a geld of 72 pence (6\r\nNorman shillings) upon the hide. That this tax was enormously heavy is\r\nplain. Taking one case with another, it would seem that the hide was\r\nfrequently supposed to be worth about £1 a year and there were many\r\nhides in England that were worth far less. But grievous as was the tax\r\nwhich immediately preceded the making of the survey, we are not entitled\r\nto infer that it was of unprecedented severity. It brought William but\r\n£415 or thereabouts from Dorset and £510 or thereabouts from\r\nSomerset[17]. Worcestershire was deemed to contain about 1200 hides and\r\ntherefore, even if none of its hides had been exempted, it would have\r\ncontributed but £360. If the huge sums mentioned by the chronicler had\r\nreally been exacted, and that too within the memory of men who were yet\r\nliving, William might well regard the right to levy a geld as the most\r\nprecious jewel in his English crown. To secure a due and punctual\r\npayment of it was worth a gigantic effort, a survey such as had never\r\nbeen made and a record such as had never been penned since the grandest\r\ndays of the old Roman Empire. But further, the assessment of the geld\r\nsadly needed reform. Owing to one cause and another, owing to privileges\r\nand immunities that had been capriciously granted, owing also, so we\r\nthink, to a radically vicious method of computing the geldable areas of\r\ncounties and hundreds, the old assessment was full of anomalies and\r\niniquities. Some estates were over-rated, others were scandalously\r\nunder-rated. That William intended to correct the old assessment, or\r\nrather to sweep it away and put a new assessment in its stead, seems\r\nhighly probable, though it has not been proved that either he or his\r\nsons accomplished this feat[18]. For this purpose, however, materials\r\nwere to be collected which would enable the royal officers to decide\r\nwhat changes were necessary in order that all England might be taxed in\r\naccordance with a just and uniform plan. Concerning each estate they\r\nwere to know the number of geldable units ('hides' or 'carucates') for\r\nwhich it had answered in King Edward's day, they were to know the number\r\nof plough oxen that there were upon it, they were to know its true\r\nannual value, they were to know whether that value had been rising or\r\nfalling during the past twenty years. Domesday Book has well been called\r\na rate book, and the task of spelling out a land law from the\r\nparticulars that it states is not unlike the task that would lie before\r\nany one who endeavoured to construct our modern law of real property out\r\nof rate books, income tax returns and similar materials. All the lands,\r\nall the land-holders of England may be brought before us, but we are\r\ntold only of such facts, such rights, such legal relationships as bear\r\non the actual or potential payment of geld. True, that some minor\r\npurposes may be achieved by the king's commissioners, though the quest\r\nfor geld is their one main object. About the rents and renders due from\r\nhis own demesne manors the king may thus obtain some valuable\r\ninformation. Also he may learn, as it were by the way, whether any of\r\nhis barons or other men have presumed to occupy, to 'invade,' lands\r\nwhich he has reserved for himself. Again, if several persons are in\r\ndispute about a tract of ground, the contest may be appeased by the\r\ntestimony of shire and hundred, or may be reserved for the king's\r\naudience; at any rate the existence of an outstanding claim may be\r\nrecorded by the royal commissioners. Here and there the peculiar customs\r\nof a shire or a borough will be stated, and incidentally the services\r\nthat certain tenants owe to their lords may be noticed. But all this is\r\ndone sporadically and unsystematically. Our record is no register of\r\ntitle, it is no feodary, it is no custumal, it is no rent roll; it is a\r\ntax book, a geld book.\r\n\r\n[The survey and the geld system.]\r\n\r\nWe say this, not by way of vain complaint against its meagreness, but\r\nbecause in our belief a care for geld and for all that concerns the\r\nassessment and payment of geld colours far more deeply than commentators\r\nhave usually supposed the information that is given to us about other\r\nmatters. We should not be surprised if definitions and distinctions\r\nwhich at first sight have little enough to do with fiscal arrangements,\r\nfor example the definition of a manor and the distinction between a\r\nvillein and a 'free man,' involved references to the apportionment and\r\nthe levy of the land-tax. Often enough it happens that legal ideas of a\r\nvery general kind are defined by fiscal rules; for example, our modern\r\nEnglish idea of 'occupation' has become so much part and parcel of a\r\nsystem of assessment that lawyers are always ready to argue that a\r\ncertain man must be an 'occupier' because such men as he are rated to\r\nthe relief of the poor. It seems then a fair supposition that any line\r\nthat Domesday Book draws systematically and sharply, whether it be\r\nbetween various classes of men or between various classes of tenements,\r\nis somehow or another connected with the main theme of that\r\nbook--geldability, actual or potential.\r\n\r\n[Weight of the danegeld.]\r\n\r\nSince we have mentioned the stories told by the chronicler about the\r\ntribute paid to the Danes, we may make a comment upon them which will\r\nbecome of importance hereafter. Those stories look true, and they seem\r\nto be accepted by modern historians. Had we been told just once that\r\nsome large number of pounds, for example £60,000, was levied, or had the\r\nsame round sum been repeated in year after year, we might well have said\r\nthat such figures deserved no attention, and that by £60,000 our\r\nannalist merely meant a big sum of money. But, as will have been seen,\r\nhe varies his figures from year to year and is not always content with a\r\nround number; he speaks of £21,099 and of £11,048[19]. We can hardly\r\ntherefore treat his statements as mere loose talk and are reluctantly\r\ndriven to suppose that they are true or near the truth. If this be so,\r\nthen, unless some discovery has yet to be made in the history of money,\r\nno word but 'appalling' will adequately describe the taxation of which\r\nhe speaks. We know pretty accurately the amount of money that became due\r\nwhen Henry I. or Henry II. imposed a danegeld of two shillings on the\r\nhide. The following table constructed from the pipe rolls will show the\r\nsum charged against each county. We arrange the shires in the order of\r\ntheir indebtedness, for a few of the many caprices of the allotment will\r\nthus be visible, and our table may be of use to us in other\r\ncontexts[20].\r\n\r\n  APPROXIMATE CHARGE OF A DANEGELD OF TWO SHILLINGS ON THE HIDE IN THE\r\n                      MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n                                 £                             £\r\n          Wiltshire             389   | Cambridge             114\r\n          Norfolk               330   | Derby and Nottingham  110\r\n          Somerset              278   | Hertford              110\r\n          Lincoln               266   | Bedford               110\r\n          Dorset                248   | Kent                  105\r\n          Oxford                242   | Devon                 104\r\n          Essex                 236   | Worcester             101\r\n          Suffolk               235   | Leicester             100\r\n          Sussex                210   | Hereford               94\r\n          Bucks                 205   | Middlesex              85\r\n          Berks                 202   | Huntingdon             71\r\n          Gloucester            190   | Stafford               44\r\n          S.

They had to take\r\nmuch less. When it was last levied, the tax was not bringing in £3500,\r\nso many were the churches and great folk who had obtained temporary or\r\npermanent exemptions from it. We will cite Leicestershire for example.\r\nThe total of the geld charged upon it was almost exactly or quite\r\nexactly £100. On the second roll of Henry II.'s reign we find that £25.\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ have been paid into the treasury, that £22. 8_s._ 3_d._ have\r\nbeen 'pardoned' to magnates and templars, that £51. 8_s._ 2_d._ are\r\nwritten off in respect of waste, and that 16_s._ 0_d._ are still due. On\r\nthe eighth roll the account shows that £62. 12_s._ 7_d._ have been paid\r\nand that £37. 6_s._ 9_d._ have been 'pardoned.' No, what our table\r\ndisplays is the amount that would be raised if all exemptions were\r\ndisregarded and no penny forborne. And now let us turn back to the\r\nchronicle and (not to take an extreme example) read of £30,000 being\r\nraised. Unless we are prepared to bring against the fathers of English\r\nhistory a charge of repeated, wanton and circumstantial lying, we shall\r\nthink of the danegeld of Æthelred's reign and of Cnut's as of an impost\r\nso heavy that it was fully capable of transmuting a whole nation.\r\nTherefore the lines that are drawn by the incidence of this tribute will\r\nbe deep and permanent; but still we must remember that primarily they\r\nwill be fiscal lines.\r\n\r\n[Unstable terminology of the survey.]\r\n\r\nThen again, we ought not to look to Domesday Book for a settled and\r\nstable scheme of technical terms. Such a scheme could not be established\r\nin a brief twenty years. About one half of the technical terms that meet\r\nus, about one half of the terms which, as we think, ought to be\r\nprecisely defined, are, we may say, English terms. They are ancient\r\nEnglish words, or they are words brought hither by the Danes, or they\r\nare Latin words which have long been in use in England and have acquired\r\nspecial meanings in relation to English affairs. On the other hand,\r\nabout half the technical terms are French. Some of them are old Latin\r\nwords which have acquired special meanings in France, some are Romance\r\nwords newly coined in France, some are Teutonic words which tell of the\r\nFrankish conquest of Gaul. In the one great class we place _scira_,\r\n_hundredum_, _wapentac_, _hida_, _berewica_, _inland_, _haga_, _soka_,\r\n_saka_, _geldum_, _gablum_, _scotum_, _heregeat_, _gersuma_, _thegnus_,\r\n_sochemannus_, _burus_, _coscet_; in the other _comitatus_, _carucata_,\r\n_virgata_, _bovata_, _arpentum_, _manerium_, _feudum_, _alodium_,\r\n_homagium_, _relevium_, _baro_, _vicecomes_, _vavassor_, _villanus_,\r\n_bordarius_, _colibertus_, _hospes_. It is not in twenty years that a\r\nsettled and stable scheme can be formed out of such elements as these.\r\nAnd often enough it is very difficult for us to give just the right\r\nmeaning to some simple Latin word. If we translate _miles_ by _soldier_\r\nor _warrior_, this may be too indefinite; if we translate it by\r\n_knight_, this may be too definite, and yet leave open the question\r\nwhether we are comparing the _miles_ of 1086 with the _cniht_ of\r\nunconquered England or with the knight of the thirteenth century. If we\r\nrender _vicecomes_ by _sheriff_ we are making our sheriff too little of\r\na _vicomte_. When _comes_ is before us we have to choose between giving\r\nBritanny an _earl_, giving Chester a _count_, or offending some of our\r\n_comites_ by invidious distinctions. Time will show what these words\r\nshall mean. Some will perish in the struggle for existence; others have\r\nlong and adventurous careers before them. At present two sets of terms\r\nare rudely intermixed; the time when they will grow into an organic\r\nwhole is but beginning.\r\n\r\n[Legal ideas of cent. xi.]\r\n\r\nTo this we must add that, unless we have mistaken the general drift of\r\nlegal history, the law implied in Domesday Book ought to be for us very\r\ndifficult law, far more difficult than the law of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, for the thirteenth century is nearer to us than is the\r\neleventh. The grown man will find it easier to think the thoughts of the\r\nschool-boy than to think the thoughts of the baby. And yet the doctrine\r\nthat our remote forefathers being simple folk had simple law dies hard.\r\nToo often we allow ourselves to suppose that, could we but get back to\r\nthe beginning, we should find that all was intelligible and should then\r\nbe able to watch the process whereby simple ideas were smothered under\r\nsubtleties and technicalities. But it is not so. Simplicity is the\r\noutcome of technical subtlety; it is the goal not the starting point. As\r\nwe go backwards the familiar outlines become blurred; the ideas become\r\nfluid, and instead of the simple we find the indefinite. But difficult\r\nthough our task may be, we must turn to it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [2] Inquisitio Comitatus Cantabrigiae, ed. N. E. Hamilton.

Trithings or ridings appear in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, lathes\r\nin Kent, rapes in Sussex, while leets appear, at least sporadically, in\r\nNorfolk[22]. These provincial peculiarities we must pass by, nor will we\r\npause to comment at any length on the changes in the boundaries of\r\ncounties and of hundreds that have taken place since the date of the\r\nsurvey. Though these changes have been many and some few of them have\r\nbeen large[23], we may still say that as a general rule the political\r\ngeography of England was already stereotyped. And we see that already\r\nthere are many curious anomalies, 'detached portions' of counties,\r\ndiscrete hundreds, places that are extra-hundredal[24], places that for\r\none purpose are in one county and for another purpose in another\r\ncounty[25]. We see also that proprietary rights have already been making\r\nsport of arrangements which in our eyes should be fixed by public law.\r\nEarls, sheriffs and others have enjoyed a marvellous power of taking a\r\ntract of land out of one district and placing it, or 'making it lie' in\r\nanother district[26]. Land is constantly spoken of as though it were the\r\nmost portable of things; it can easily be taken from one vill or hundred\r\nand be added to or placed in or caused to lie in another vill or\r\nhundred. This 'notional movability' of land, if we may use such a term,\r\nwill become of importance to us when we are studying the formation of\r\nmanors.\r\n\r\n[The vill as the geographical unit.]\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, we are concerned with the general truth that\r\nEngland is divided into counties, hundreds or wapentakes and vills. This\r\nis the geographical basis of the survey. That basis, however, is hidden\r\nfrom us by the form of our record. The plan adopted by those who\r\nfashioned Domesday Book out of the returns provided for them by the\r\nking's commissioners is a curious, compromising plan. We may say that in\r\npart it is geographical, while in part it is feudal or proprietary. It\r\ntakes each county separately and thus far it is geographical; but within\r\nthe boundaries of each county it arranges the lands under the names of\r\nthe tenants in chief who hold them. Thus all the lands in Cambridgeshire\r\nof which Count Alan is tenant in chief are brought together, no matter\r\nthat they lie scattered about in various hundreds. Therefore it is\r\nnecessary for us to understand that the original returns reported by the\r\nsurveyors did not reach the royal treasury in this form. At least as\r\nregards the county of Cambridge, we can be certain of this. The hundreds\r\nwere taken one by one; they were taken in a geographical order, and not\r\nuntil the justices had learned all that was to be known of Staplehow\r\nhundred did they call upon the jurors of Cheveley hundred for their\r\nverdict. That such was their procedure we might have guessed even had we\r\nnot been fortunate enough to have a copy of the Cambridgeshire verdicts;\r\nfor, though the commissioners seem to have held but one moot for each\r\nshire, still it is plain that each hundred was represented by a separate\r\nset of jurors[27]. But from these Cambridgeshire verdicts we learn what\r\notherwise we could hardly have known. Within each hundred the survey was\r\nmade by vills[28]. If we suppose the commissioners charging the jurors\r\nwe must represent them as saying, not 'Tell us what tenants in chief\r\nhave lands in your hundred and how much each of them holds,' but 'Tell\r\nus about each vill in your hundred, who holds land in it.' Thus, for\r\nexample, the men of the Armingford hundred are called up. They make a\r\nseparate report about each vill in it. They begin by stating that the\r\nvill is rated at a certain number of hides and then they proceed to\r\ndistribute those hides among the tenants in chief. Thus, for example,\r\nthey say that Abington was rated at 5 hides, and that those 5 hides are\r\ndistributed thus[29]:\r\n\r\n                                                        hides   virgates\r\n  Hugh Pincerna holds of the bishop of Winchester       2-1/2      1/2\r\n  The king                                                1/2\r\n  Ralph and Robert hold of Hardouin de Eschalers        1        1-1/2\r\n  Earl Roger                                                     1\r\n  Picot the sheriff                                                1/2\r\n  Alwin Hamelecoc the bedel holds of the king                      1/2\r\n                                                        _____    _____\r\n                                                        5        0\r\n\r\nNow in Domesday Book we must look to several different pages to get this\r\ninformation about the vill of Abington,--to one page for Earl Roger's\r\nland, to another page for Picot's land, and we may easily miss the\r\nimportant fact that this vill of Abington has been rated as a whole at\r\nthe neat, round figure of 5 hides. And then we see that the whole\r\nhundred of Armingford has been rated at the neat, round figure of 100\r\nhides, and has consisted of six vills rated at 10 hides apiece and eight\r\nvills rated at 5 hides apiece[30]. Thus we are brought to look upon the\r\nvill as a unit in a system of assessment. All this is concealed from us\r\nby the form of Domesday Book.\r\n\r\n[Stability of the vill.]\r\n\r\nWhen that book mentions the name of a place, when it says that Roger\r\nholds Sutton or that Ralph holds three hides in Norton, we regard that\r\nname as the name of a vill; it may or may not be also the name of a\r\nmanor. Speaking very generally we may say that the place so named will\r\nin after times be known as a vill and in our own day will be a civil\r\nparish. No doubt in some parts of the country new vills have been\r\ncreated since the Conqueror's time. Some names that occur in our record\r\nfail to obtain a permanent place on the roll of English vills, become\r\nthe names of hamlets or disappear altogether; on the other hand, new\r\nnames come to the front. Of course we dare not say dogmatically that all\r\nthe names mentioned in Domesday Book were the names of vills; very\r\npossibly (if this distinction was already known) some of them were the\r\nnames of hamlets; nor, again, do we imply that the _villa_ of 1086 had\r\nmuch organization; but a place that is mentioned in Domesday Book will\r\nprobably be recognized as a vill in the thirteenth, a civil parish in\r\nthe nineteenth century. Let us take Cambridgeshire by way of example.\r\nExcluding the Isle of Ely, we find that the political geography of the\r\nConqueror's reign has endured until our own time. The boundaries of the\r\nhundreds lie almost where they lay, the number of vills has hardly been\r\nincreased or diminished. The chief changes amount to this:--A small\r\ntract on the east side of the county containing Exning and Bellingham\r\nhas been made over to Suffolk; four other names contained in Domesday no\r\nlonger stand for parishes, while the names of five of our modern\r\nparishes--one of them is the significant name of Newton--are not found\r\nthere[31]. But about a hundred and ten vills that were vills in 1086\r\nare vills or civil parishes at the present day, and in all probability\r\nthey then had approximately the same boundaries that they have now.\r\n\r\n[Omission of vills.]\r\n\r\nThis may be a somewhat too favourable example of permanence and\r\ncontinuity. Of all counties Cambridgeshire is the one whose ancient\r\ngeography can be the most easily examined; but wherever we have looked\r\nwe have come to the conclusion that the distribution of England into\r\nvills is in the main as old as the Norman conquest[32]. Two causes of\r\ndifficulty may be noticed, for they are of some interest. Owing to what\r\nwe have called the 'notional movability' of land, we never can be quite\r\nsure that when certain hides or acres are said to be in or lie in a\r\ncertain place they are really and physically in that place. They are\r\nreally in one village, but they are spoken of as belonging to another\r\nvillage, because their occupants pay their geld or do their services in\r\nthe latter. Manorial and fiscal geography interferes with physical and\r\nvillar geography. We have lately seen how land rated at five hides was\r\ncomprised, as a matter of fact, in the vill of Abington; but of those\r\nfive hides, one virgate 'lay in' Shingay, a half-hide 'lay in'\r\nLitlington while a half-virgate 'lay and had always lain' in Morden[33].\r\nThis, if we mistake not, leads in some cases to an omission of the names\r\nof small vills. A great lord has a compact estate, perhaps the whole of\r\none of the small southern hundreds. He treats it as a whole, and all the\r\nland that he has there will be ascribed to some considerable village in\r\nwhich he has his hall. We should be rash in supposing that there were no\r\nother villages on this land. For example, in Surrey there is now-a-days\r\na hundred called Farnham which comprises the parish of Farnham, the\r\nparish of Frensham and some other villages. If we mistake not, all that\r\nDomesday Book has to say of the whole of this territory is that the\r\nBishop of Winchester holds Farnham, that it has been rated at 60 hides,\r\nthat it has been worth the large sum of £65 a year and that there are so\r\nmany tenants upon it[34]. We certainly must not draw the inference that\r\nthere was but one vill in this tract. If the bishop is tenant in chief\r\nof the whole hundred and has become responsible for all the geld that\r\nis levied therefrom, there is no great reason why the surveyors should\r\ntrouble themselves about the vills. Thus the simple _Episcopus tenet\r\nFerneham_ may dispose of some 25,000 acres of land. So the same bishop\r\nhas an estate at Chilcombe in Hampshire; but clearly the name\r\n_Ciltecumbe_ covers a wide territory for there are no less than nine\r\nchurches upon it[35]. We never can be very certain about the boundaries\r\nof these large and compact estates.\r\n\r\n[Fission of vills.]\r\n\r\nA second cause of difficulty lies in the fact that in comparatively\r\nmodern times, from the twelfth century onwards, two or three contiguous\r\nvillages will often bear the same name and be distinguished only by what\r\nwe may call their surnames--thus Guilden Morden and Steeple Morden,\r\nStratfield Saye, Stratfield Turgis, Stratfield Mortimer, Tolleshunt\r\nKnights, Tolleshunt Major, Tolleshunt Darcy. Such cases are common; in\r\nsome districts they are hardly exceptional. Doubtless they point to a\r\ntime when a single village by some process of colonization or\r\nsubdivision become two villages. Now Domesday Book seldom enables us to\r\nsay for certain whether the change has already taken place. In a few\r\ninstances it marks off the little village from the great village of the\r\nsame name[36]. In some other instances it will speak, for example, of\r\n_Mordune_ and _Mordune Alia_, of _Emingeforde_ and _Emingeforde Alia_,\r\nor the like, thus showing both that the change has taken place, and also\r\nthat it is so recent that it is recognized only by very clumsy terms. In\r\nCambridgeshire, since we have the original verdicts, we can see that the\r\ntwo Mordens are already distinct; the one is rated at ten hides, the\r\nother at five[37]. On the other hand, we can see that our Great and\r\nLittle Shelford are rated as one vill of twenty hides[38], our Castle\r\nCamps and Shudy Camps as one vill of five hides[39]. Elsewhere we are\r\nleft to guess whether the fission is complete, and the surnames that\r\nmany of our vills ultimately acquire, the names of families which rose\r\nto greatness in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, will often suggest\r\nthat the surveyors saw but one vill where we see two[40]. However, the\r\nbroad truth stands out that England was divided into vills and that in\r\ngeneral the vill of Domesday Book is still a vill in after days[41].\r\n\r\n[The nucleated village and the vill of scattered steads.]\r\n\r\nThe 'vill' or 'town' of the later middle ages was, like the 'civil\r\nparish' of our own day, a tract of land with some houses on it, and this\r\ntract was a unit in the national system of police and finance[42], But\r\nwe are not entitled to make for ourselves any one typical picture of the\r\nEnglish vill. We are learning from the ordnance map (that marvellous\r\npalimpsest, which under Dr Meitzen's guidance we are beginning to\r\ndecipher) that in all probability we must keep at least two types before\r\nour minds. On the one hand, there is what we might call the true village\r\nor the nucleated village. In the purest form of this type there is one\r\nand only one cluster of houses. It is a fairly large cluster; it stands\r\nin the midst of its fields, of its territory, and until lately a\r\nconsiderable part of its territory will probably have consisted of\r\nspacious 'common fields.' In a country in which there are villages of\r\nthis type the parish boundaries seem almost to draw themselves[43]. On\r\nthe other hand, we may easily find a country in which there are few\r\nvillages of this character. The houses which lie within the boundary of\r\nthe parish are scattered about in small clusters; here two or three,\r\nthere three or four. These clusters often have names of their own, and\r\nit seems a mere chance that the name borne by one of them should be also\r\nthe name of the whole parish or vill[44]. We see no traces of very large\r\nfields. On the face of the map there is no reason why a particular group\r\nof cottages should be reckoned to belong to this parish rather than to\r\nthe next. As our eyes grow accustomed to the work we may arrive at some\r\nextremely important conclusions such as those which Meitzen has\r\nsuggested. The outlines of our nucleated villages may have been drawn\r\nfor us by Germanic settlers, whereas in the land of hamlets and\r\nscattered steads old Celtic arrangements may never have been thoroughly\r\neffaced. Towards theories of this kind we are slowly winning our way.\r\nIn the meantime let us remember that a _villa_ of Domesday Book may\r\ncorrespond to one of at least two very different models or may be\r\nintermediate between various types. It may be a fairly large and\r\nagrarianly organic unit, or it may be a group of small agrarian units\r\nwhich are being held together in one whole merely by an external force,\r\nby police law and fiscal law[45].\r\n\r\n[Illustrations by maps.]\r\n\r\nTwo little fragments of 'the original one inch ordnance map' will be\r\nmore eloquent than would be many paragraphs of written discourse. The\r\none pictures a district on the border between Oxfordshire and Berkshire\r\ncut by the Thames and the main line of the Great Western Railway; the\r\nother a district on the border between Devon and Somerset, north of\r\nCollumpton and south of Wiveliscombe. Neither is an extreme example.\r\nTrue villages we may easily find. Cambridgeshire, for instance, would\r\nhave afforded some beautiful specimens, for many of the 'open fields'\r\nwere still open when the ordnance map of that county was made. But\r\nthroughout large tracts of England, even though there has been an\r\n'inclosure' and there are no longer any open fields, our map often shows\r\na land of villages. When it does so and the district that it portrays is\r\na purely agricultural district, we may generally assume without going\r\nfar wrong that the villages are ancient, for during at least the last\r\nthree centuries the predominant current in our agrarian history has set\r\nagainst the formation of villages and towards the distribution of\r\nscattered homesteads. To find the purest specimens of a land of hamlets\r\nwe ought to go to Wales or to Cornwall or to other parts of 'the Celtic\r\nfringe'; very fair examples might be found throughout the west of\r\nEngland. Also we may perhaps find hamlets rather than villages wherever\r\nthere have been within the historic period large tracts of forest land.\r\nVery often, again, the parish or township looks on our map like a\r\nhybrid. We seem to see a village with satellitic hamlets. Much more\r\nremains to be done before we shall be able to construe the testimony of\r\nour fields and walls and hedges, but at least two types of vill must be\r\nin our eyes when we are reading Domesday Book[46].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LAND OF VILLAGES\r\n              _On the border between Oxfordshire and Berkshire._\r\n              [_Between pp._ 16-17]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LAND OF HAMLETS\r\n              _On the border between Somerset and Devon._]\r\n\r\n[Size of the vill.]\r\n\r\nTo say that the _villa_ of Domesday Book is in general the vill of the\r\nthirteenth century and the civil parish of the nineteenth is to say that\r\nthe areal extent of the _villa_ varied widely from case to case. More\r\nimportant is it for us to observe that the number of inhabitants of the\r\n_villa_ varied widely from case to case. The error into which we are\r\nmost likely to fall will be that of making our vill too populous. Some\r\nvills, especially some royal vills, are populous enough; a few contain a\r\nhundred households; but the average township is certainly much smaller\r\nthan this[47]. Before we give any figures, it should first be observed\r\nthat Domesday Book never enables us to count heads. It states the number\r\nof the tenants of various classes, _sochemanni_, _villani_, _bordarii_,\r\nand the like, and leaves us to suppose that each of these persons is, or\r\nmay be, the head of a household. It also states how many _servi_ there\r\nare. Whether we ought to suppose that only the heads of servile\r\nhouseholds are reckoned, or whether we ought to think of the _servi_ as\r\nhaving no households but as living within the lord's gates and being\r\nenumerated, men, women and able-bodied children, by the head--this is a\r\ndifficult question. Still we may reach some results which will enable us\r\nto compare township with township. By way of fair sample we may take the\r\nArmingford hundred of Cambridgeshire, and all persons who are above the\r\nrank of _servi_ we will include under the term 'the non-servile\r\npopulation[48].'\r\n\r\n                     ARMINGFORD HUNDRED.\r\n\r\n                    Non-servile\r\n                    population    Servi    Total\r\n\r\n          Abington        19        0         19\r\n          Bassingbourn    35        3         38\r\n          Clapton         19        0         19\r\n          Croydon         29        0         29\r\n          Hatley          18        3         21\r\n          Litlington      37        6         43\r\n          Melbourn        62        1         63\r\n          Meldreth        44        7         51\r\n          Morden          43       11         54\r\n          Morden Alia     50        0         50\r\n          Shingay         18        0         18\r\n          Tadlow          27        4         31\r\n          Wendy           12        4         16\r\n          Whaddon         44        6         50\r\n                         ---      ---        ---\r\n              Total      457       45        502\r\n\r\n\r\nHere in fourteen vills we have an average of thirty-two non-servile\r\nhouseholds for every vill. Now even in our own day a parish with\r\nthirty-two houses, though small, is not extremely small. But we should\r\nform a wrong picture of the England of the eleventh century if we filled\r\nall parts of it with such vills as these. We will take at random\r\nfourteen vills in Staffordshire held by Earl Roger[49].\r\n\r\n                    Non-servile\r\n                    population    Servi   Total\r\n\r\n          Claverlege      45        0        45\r\n          Nordlege         9        0         9\r\n          Alvidelege      13        0        13\r\n          Halas           40        2        42\r\n          Chenistelei     11        0        11\r\n          Otne             7        1         8\r\n          Nortberie       20        1        21\r\n          Erlide           8        2        10\r\n          Gaitone         16        0        16\r\n          Cressvale       8         0         8\r\n          Dodintone       3         0         3\r\n          Modreshale      5         0         5\r\n          Almentone       8         0         8\r\n          Metford         7         1         8\r\n                        ---       ---       ---\r\n               Total    200         7       207\r\n\r\nHere for fourteen vills we have an average of but fourteen non-servile\r\nhouseholds and the _servi_ are so few that we may neglect them. We will\r\nnext look at a page in the survey of Somersetshire which describes\r\ncertain vills that have fallen to the lot of the bishop of\r\nCoutances[50].\r\n\r\n                         Non-servile\r\n                         population   Servi    Total\r\n\r\n          Winemeresham    8         3       11\r\n          Chetenore       3         1        4\r\n          Widicumbe      21         6       27\r\n          Harpetrev      10         2       12\r\n          Hotune         11         0       11\r\n          Lilebere        6         1        7\r\n          Wintreth        4         2        6\r\n          Aisecome       11         7       18\r\n          Clutone        22         1       23\r\n          Temesbare       7         3       10\r\n          Nortone        16         3       19\r\n          Cliveham       15         1       16\r\n          Ferenberge     13         6       19\r\n          Cliveware       6         0        6\r\n                        ---       ---      ---\r\n                Total   153        36      189\r\n\r\nHere we have on the average but eleven non-servile households for each\r\nvillage, and even if we suppose each _servus_ to represent a household,\r\nwe have not fourteen households. Yet smaller vills will be found in\r\nDevonshire, many vills in which the total number of the persons\r\nmentioned does not exceed ten and near half of these are _servi_. In\r\nCornwall the townships, if townships we ought to call them, are yet\r\nsmaller; often we can attribute no more than five or six families to the\r\nvill even if we include the _servi_.\r\n\r\n[Population of the vills.]\r\n\r\n[Contrast between east and west.]\r\n\r\nUnless our calculations mislead us, the density of the population in the\r\naverage vill of a given county varies somewhat directly with the density\r\nof the population in that county; at all events we can not say that\r\nwhere vills are populous, vills will be few. As regards this matter no\r\nprecise results are attainable; our document is full of snares for\r\narithmeticians. Still if for a moment we have recourse to the crude\r\nmethod of dividing the number of acres comprised in a modern county by\r\nthe number of the persons who are mentioned in the survey of that\r\ncounty, the outcome of our calculation will be remarkable and will point\r\nto some broad truth[51]. For Suffolk the quotient is 46 or thereabouts;\r\nfor Norfolk but little larger[52]; for Essex 61, for Lincoln 67; for\r\nBedford, Berkshire, Northampton, Leicester, Middlesex, Oxford, Kent and\r\nSomerset it lies between 70 and 80, for Buckingham, Warwick, Sussex,\r\nWiltshire and Dorset it lies between 80 and 90; Devon, Gloucester,\r\nWorcester, Hereford are thinly peopled, Cornwall, Stafford, Shropshire\r\nvery thinly. Some particular results that we should thus attain would be\r\ndelusive. Thus we should say that men were sparse in Cambridgeshire, did\r\nwe not remember that a large part of our modern Cambridgeshire was then\r\na sheet of water. Permanent physical causes interfere with the operation\r\nof the general rule. Thus Surrey, with its wide heaths has, as we might\r\nexpect, but few men to the square mile. Derbyshire has many vills lying\r\nwaste; Yorkshire is so much wasted that it can give us no valuable\r\nresult; and again, Yorkshire and Cheshire were larger than they are now,\r\nwhile Rutland and the adjacent counties had not their present\r\nboundaries. For all this however, we come to a very general rule:--the\r\ndensity of the population decreases as we pass from east to west. With\r\nthis we may connect another rule:--land is much more valuable in the\r\neast than it is in the west. This matter is indeed hedged in by many\r\nthorny questions; still whatever hypothesis we may adopt as to the mode\r\nin which land was valued, one general truth comes out pretty plainly,\r\nnamely, that, economic arrangements being what they were, it was far\r\nbetter to have a team-land in Essex than to have an equal area of arable\r\nland in Devon.\r\n\r\n[Small vills.]\r\n\r\nBetween eastern and western England there were differences visible to\r\nthe natural eye. With these were connected unseen and legal differences,\r\npartly as causes, partly as effects. But for the moment let us dwell on\r\nthe fact that many an English vill has very few inhabitants. We are to\r\nspeak hereafter of village communities. Let us therefore reflect that a\r\ncommunity of some eight or ten householders is not likely to be a highly\r\norganized entity. This is not all, for these eight or ten householders\r\nwill often belong to two, three or four different social and economic,\r\nif not legal, classes. Some may be sokemen, some _villani_, _bordarii_,\r\n_cotarii_, and besides them there will be a few _servi_. If a vill\r\nconsists, as in Devonshire often enough it will, of some three\r\n_villani_, some four _bordarii_ and some two _servi_, the\r\n'township-moot,' if such a moot there be, will be a queer little\r\nassembly, the manorial court, if such a court there be, will not have\r\nmuch to do. These men can not have many communal affairs; there will be\r\nno great scope for dooms or for by-laws; they may well take all their\r\ndisputes into the hundred court, especially in Devonshire where the\r\nhundreds are small. Thus of the visible vill of the eleventh century and\r\nits material surroundings we may form a wrong notion. Often enough in\r\nthe west its common fields (if common fields it had) were not wide\r\nfields; the men who had shares therein were few and belonged to various\r\nclasses. Thus of two villages in Gloucestershire, Brookthorpe and\r\nHarescombe, all that we can read is that in Brostrop there were two\r\nteams, one _villanus_, three _bordarii_, four _servi_, while in\r\nHersecome there were two teams, two _bordarii_ and five _servi_[53].\r\nMany a Devonshire township can produce but two or three teams. Often\r\nenough our 'village community' will be a heterogeneous little group\r\nwhose main capital consists of some 300 acres of arable land and some 20\r\nbeasts of the plough.\r\n\r\n[Importance of the east.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must be careful not to omit from our view the\r\nrich and thickly populated shires or to imagine or to speak as though we\r\nimagined that a general theory of English history can neglect the East\r\nof England. If we leave Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk out of account\r\nwe are to all appearance leaving out of account not much less than a\r\nquarter of the whole nation[54]. Let us make three groups of counties:\r\n(1) a South-Western group containing Devon, Somerset, Dorset and\r\nWiltshire: (2) a Mid-Western group containing the shires of Gloucester,\r\nWorcester, Hereford, Salop, Stafford and Warwick: (3) an Eastern group\r\ncontaining Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. The first of these groups\r\nhas the largest; the third the smallest acreage. In Domesday Book,\r\nhowever, the figures which state their population seem to be\r\nthese[55]:--\r\n\r\n          South-Western Group:    49,155\r\n          Mid-Western Group:      33,191\r\n          Eastern Group:          72,883\r\n\r\nThese figures are so emphatic that they may cause us for a moment to\r\ndoubt their value, and on details we must lay no stress. But we have\r\nmaterials which enable us to check the general effect. In 1297 Edward I.\r\nlevied a lay subsidy of a ninth[56]. The sums borne by our three groups\r\nof counties were these:--\r\n\r\n                                    £\r\n          South-Western Group:    4,038\r\n          Mid-Western Group:      3,514\r\n          Eastern Group:          7,329\r\n\r\nThere is a curious resemblance between these two sets of figures. Then\r\nin 1377 and 1381 returns were made for a poll-tax[57]. The number of\r\npolls returned in our three groups were these:--\r\n\r\n                                  1377      1381\r\n          South-Western Group:   183,842   106,086\r\n          Mid-Western Group:     158,245   115,679\r\n          Eastern Group:         255,498   182,830\r\n\r\nNo doubt all inferences drawn from medieval statistics are exceedingly\r\nprecarious; but, unless a good many figures have conspired to deceive\r\nus, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk were at the time of the Conquest\r\nand for three centuries afterwards vastly richer and more populous than\r\nany tract of equal area in the West.\r\n\r\n[Manorial and non-manorial vills.]\r\n\r\nAnother distinction between the eastern counties and the rest of England\r\nis apparent. In many shires we shall find that the name of each vill is\r\nmentioned once and no more. This is so because the land of each vill\r\nbelongs in its entirety to some one tenant in chief. We may go further:\r\nwe may say, though at present in an untechnical sense, that each vill is\r\na manor. Such is the general rule, though there will be exceptions to\r\nit. On the other hand, in the eastern counties this rule will become the\r\nexception. For example, of the fourteen vills in the Armingford hundred\r\nof Cambridgeshire there is but one of which it is true that the whole\r\nof its land is held by a single tenant in chief. In this county it is\r\ncommon to find that three or four Norman lords hold land in the same\r\nvill. This seems true not only of Cambridgeshire but also of Essex,\r\nSuffolk, Norfolk, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, and some parts of\r\nYorkshire. Even in other districts of England the rule that each vill\r\nhas a single lord is by no means unbroken in the Conqueror's day and we\r\ncan see that there were many exceptions to it in the Confessor's. A\r\ncareful examination of all England vill by vill would perhaps show that\r\nthe contrast which we are noting is neither so sharp nor so ancient as\r\nat first sight it seems to be: nevertheless it exists.\r\n\r\n[The distribution of free men and serfs.]\r\n\r\nA better known contrast there is. The eastern counties are the home of\r\nliberty[58]. We may divide the tillers of the soil into five great\r\nclasses; these in order of dignity and freedom are (1) _liberi homines_,\r\n(2) _sochemanni_, (3) _villani_, (4) _bordarii_, _cotarii_ etc., (5)\r\n_servi_. The two first of these classes are to be found in large numbers\r\nonly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire\r\nand Northamptonshire. We shall hereafter see that Cambridgeshire also\r\nhas been full of sokemen, though since the Conquest they have fallen\r\nfrom their high estate. On the other hand, the number of _servi_\r\nincreases pretty steadily as we cross the country from east to west. It\r\nreaches its maximum in Cornwall and Gloucestershire; it is very low in\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Derby, Leicester, Middlesex, Sussex; it descends to\r\nzero in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. This descent to zero may fairly warn\r\nus that the terms with which we are dealing may not bear precisely the\r\nsame meaning in all parts of England, or that a small class is apt to be\r\nreckoned as forming part of a larger class. But still it is clear enough\r\nthat some of these terms are used with care and express real and\r\nimportant distinctions.\r\n\r\n[The classification of men.]\r\n\r\nOf this we are assured by a document which seems to reproduce the\r\nwording of the instructions which defined the duty of at least one party\r\nof royal commissioners[59]. We are about to speak of the mode in which\r\nthe occupants of the soil are classified by Domesday Book, and therefore\r\nthis document deserves our best attention. It runs thus:--The King's\r\nbarons inquired by the oath of the sheriff of the shire and of all the\r\nbarons and of their Frenchmen and of the whole hundred, the priest,\r\nreeve and six _villani_ of every vill, how the mansion (_mansio_) is\r\ncalled, who held it in the time of King Edward, who holds it now, how\r\nmany hides, how many plough-teams on the demesne, how many plough-teams\r\nof the men, how many _villani_, how many _cotarii_, how many _servi_,\r\nhow many _liberi homines_, how many _sochemanni_, how much wood, how\r\nmuch meadow, how much pasture, how many mills, how many fisheries, how\r\nmuch has been taken away therefrom, how much added thereto, and how much\r\nthere is now, how much each _liber homo_ and _sochemannus_ had and\r\nhas:--All this thrice over, to wit as regards the time of King Edward,\r\nthe time when King William gave it, and the present time, and whether\r\nmore can be had thence than is had now[60].\r\n\r\n[Basis of classification.]\r\n\r\nFive classes of men are mentioned and they are mentioned in an order\r\nthat is extremely curious:--_villani_, _cotarii_, _servi_, _liberi\r\nhomines_, _sochemanni_. It descends three steps, then it leaps from the\r\nvery bottom of the scale to the very top and thence it descends one\r\nstep. A parody of it might speak of the rural population of modern\r\nEngland as consisting of large farmers, small farmers, cottagers, great\r\nlandlords, small landlords. But a little consideration will convince us\r\nthat beneath this apparent caprice there lies some legal principle. We\r\nshall observe that these five species of tenants are grouped into two\r\ngenera. The king wants to know how much each _liber homo_, how much each\r\n_sochemannus_ holds; he does not want to know how much each _villanus_,\r\neach _cotarius_, each _servus_ holds. Connecting this with the main\r\nobject of the whole survey, we shall probably be brought to the guess\r\nthat between the sokeman and the villein there is some broad distinction\r\nwhich concerns the king as the recipient of geld. May it not be\r\nthis:--the villein's lord is answerable for the geld due from the land\r\nthat the villein holds, the sokeman's lord is not answerable, at least\r\nhe is not answerable as principal debtor for the geld due from the land\r\nthat the sokeman holds? If this be so, the order in which the five\r\nclasses of men are mentioned will not seem unnatural. It proceeds\r\noutwards from the lord and his _mansio_. First it mentions the persons\r\nseated on land for the geld of which he is responsible, and them it\r\narranges in an 'order of merit.' Then it turns to persons who, though in\r\nsome way or another connected with the lord and his _mansio_, are\r\nthemselves tax-payers, and concerning them the commissioners are to\r\ninquire how much each of them holds. Of course we can not say that this\r\ntheory is proved by the statement that lies before us; but it is\r\nsuggested by that statement and may for a while serve us as a working\r\nhypothesis. If this theory be sound, then we have here a distinction of\r\nthe utmost importance. For one mighty purpose, the purpose that is\r\nuppermost in King William's mind, the _villanus_ is not a landowner, his\r\nlord is the landowner; on the other hand the _sochemannus_ is a\r\nlandowner, and is taxed as such. We are not saying that this is a purely\r\nfiscal distinction. In legal logic the lord's liability for the geld\r\nthat is apportioned on the land occupied by his villeins may be rather\r\nan effect than a cause. A lawyer might argue that the lord must pay\r\nbecause the occupier is his _villanus_, not that the occupier is a\r\n_villanus_ because the lord pays. And yet, as we may often see in legal\r\nhistory, there will be action and reaction between cause and effect. The\r\ngeld is no trifle. Levied at that rate of six shillings on the hide at\r\nwhich King William has just now levied it, it is a momentous force\r\ncapable of depressing and displacing whole classes of men. In 1086 this\r\ntax is so much in everybody's mind that any distinction as to its\r\nincidence will cut deeply into the body of the law.\r\n\r\n[Our course.]\r\n\r\nNow this classification of men we will take as the starting point for\r\nour enterprise. If we could define the _liber homo_, _sochemannus_,\r\n_villanus_, _cotarius_, _servus_, we should have solved some of the\r\ngreat legal problems of Domesday Book, for by the way we should have had\r\nto define two other difficult terms, namely _manerium_ and _soca_. It\r\nwould then remain that we should say something of the higher strata of\r\nsociety, of earls and sheriffs, of barons, knights, thegns and their\r\ntenures, of such terms as _alodium_ and _feudum_, of the general theory\r\nof landownership or landholdership. We will begin with the lowest order\r\nof men, with the _servi_, and thence work our way upwards. But our\r\ncourse can not be straightforward. There are so many terms to be\r\nexplained that sometimes we shall be compelled to leave a question but\r\npartially answered while we are endeavouring to find a partial answer\r\nfor some yet more difficult question.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [22] D.

On the other hand, if\r\n       they are known merely by family names such as _Styles's_,\r\n       _Nokes's_, _Johnson's_ or the like, this, though not conclusive\r\n       evidence of, is compatible with their modernity. Meitzen thinks\r\n       that in Kent and along the southern shore the German invaders\r\n       founded but few villages. The map does not convince me that\r\n       this inference is correct.\r\n\r\n  [47] When more than five-and-twenty team-lands or thereabouts are\r\n       ascribed to a single place, we shall generally find reason to\r\n       believe that what is being described is not a single vill.

We have tried to make sure that no tenant in chief\r\n       save the bishop had land in any of these vills, and this we\r\n       think fairly certain, except as regards Harptree and Norton.\r\n       There are now two Harptrees, East and West, and four or more\r\n       Nortons.\r\n\r\n  [51] We take the figures from Ellis, Introduction, ii. 417 ff.\r\n\r\n  [52] Very possibly this figure is too low. There is reason to think\r\n       that some of the free men and sokemen of these counties get\r\n       counted twice or thrice over because they hold land under\r\n       several different lords. On the other hand Ellis (Introduction,\r\n       ii. 491) would argue that the figure is too high. But the words\r\n       _Alii ibi tenent_ which occur at the end of numerous entries\r\n       mean, we believe, not that there are in this vill other\r\n       unenumerated tillers of the soil, but that the vill is divided\r\n       between several tenants in chief.\r\n\r\n  [53] D.

Perhaps,\r\n       for example, carucates, not hides, were mentioned in the\r\n       instructions given to those commissioners who were to visit the\r\n       carucated counties. Perhaps the non-appearance of _servi_ in\r\n       Yorkshire and Lincolnshire may be due to no deeper cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Serfs._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The serfs in Domesday Book.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of some 25,000 serfs is recorded. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury _servus_ and _villanus_ are, at least among lawyers, equivalent\r\nwords. The only unfree man is the 'serf-villein' and the lawyers are\r\ntrying to subject him to the curious principle that he is the lord's\r\nchattel but a free man in relation to all but his lord[61]. It is far\r\notherwise in Domesday Book. In entry after entry and county after county\r\nthe _servi_ are kept well apart from the _villani_, _bordarii_,\r\n_cotarii_. Often they are mentioned in quite another context to that in\r\nwhich the _villani_ are enumerated. As an instance we may take a manor\r\nin Surrey[62]:--'In demesne there are 5 teams and there are 25 _villani_\r\nand 6 _bordarii_ with 14 teams. There is one mill of 2 shillings and one\r\nfishery and one church and 4 acres of meadow, and wood for 150 pannage\r\npigs, and 2 stone-quarries of 2 shillings and 2 nests of hawks in the\r\nwood and 10 _servi_.' Often enough the _servi_ are placed between two\r\nother sources of wealth, the church and the mill. In some counties they\r\nseem to take precedence over the _villani_; the common formula is 'In\r\ndominio sunt _a_ carucae et _b_ servi et _c_ villani et _d_ bordarii cum\r\n_e_ carucis.' But this is delusive; the formula is bringing the _servi_\r\ninto connexion with the demesne teams and separating them from the teams\r\nof the tenants. We must render it thus--'On the demesne there are _a_\r\nteams and _b_ servi; and there are _c_ villani and _d_ bordarii with _e_\r\nteams.' Still we seem to see a gently graduated scale of social classes,\r\n_villani_, _bordarii_, _cotarii_, _servi_, and while the jurors of one\r\ncounty will arrange them in one fashion, the jurors of another county\r\nmay adopt a different scheme. Thus in their classification of mankind\r\nthe jurors will sometimes lay great stress on the possession of plough\r\noxen. In Hertfordshire we read:--'There are 6 teams in demesne and 41\r\n_villani_ and 17 _bordarii_ have 20 teams ... there are 22 _cotarii_ and\r\n12 _servi_[63].'--'The priest, 13 _villani_ and 4 _bordarii_ have 6\r\nteams ... there are two _cotarii_ and 4 _servi_[64].'--'The priest and\r\n24 _villani_ have 13 teams ... there are 12 _bordarii_, 16 _cotarii_ and\r\n11 _servi_[65].' A division is in this instance made between the people\r\nwho have oxen and the people who have none; _villani_ have oxen,\r\n_cotarii_ and _servi_ have none; sometimes the _bordarii_ stand above\r\nthis line, sometimes below it.\r\n\r\n[Legal position of the serf.]\r\n\r\nOf the legal position of the _servus_ Domesday Book tells us little or\r\nnothing; but earlier and later documents oblige us to think of him as a\r\nslave, one who in the main has no legal rights. He is the _theów_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon dooms, the _servus_ of the ecclesiastical canons. But though\r\nwe do right in calling him a slave, still we might well be mistaken were\r\nwe to think of the line which divides him from other men as being as\r\nsharp as the line which a mature jurisprudence will draw between thing\r\nand person. We may well doubt whether this principle--'The slave is a\r\nthing, not a person'--can be fully understood by a grossly barbarous\r\nage. It implies the idea of a person, and in the world of sense we find\r\nnot persons but men.\r\n\r\n[Degrees of serfdom.]\r\n\r\nThus degrees of servility are possible. A class may stand, as it were,\r\nhalf-way between the class of slaves and the class of free men. The\r\nKentish law of the seventh century as it appears in the dooms of\r\nÆthelbert[66], like many of its continental sisters, knows a class of\r\nmen who perhaps are not free men and yet are not slaves; it knows the\r\n_læt_ as well as the _theów_. From what race the Kentish _læt_ has\r\nsprung, and how, when it comes to details, the law will treat him--these\r\nare obscure questions, and the latter of them can not be answered unless\r\nwe apply to him what is written about the _laeti_, _liti_ and _lidi_ of\r\nthe continent. He is thus far a person that he has a small wergild but\r\npossibly he is bound to the soil. Only in Æthelbert's dooms do we read\r\nof him. From later days, until Domesday Book breaks the silence, we do\r\nnot obtain any definite evidence of the existence of any class of men\r\nwho are not slaves but none the less are tied to the land. Of men who\r\nare bound to do heavy labour services for their lords we do hear, but we\r\ndo not hear that if they run away they can be captured and brought\r\nback. As we shall see by and by, Domesday Book bears witness to the\r\nexistence of a class of _buri_, _burs_, _coliberti_, who seem to be\r\ndistinctly superior to the _servi_, but distinctly inferior to the\r\nvilleins, bordiers and cottiers. It is by no means impossible that they,\r\nwithout being slaves, are in a very proper and intelligible sense unfree\r\nmen, that they have civil rights which they can assert in courts of law,\r\nbut that they are tied to the soil. The gulf between the seventh and the\r\neleventh centuries is too wide to allow of our connecting them with the\r\n_læt_ of Æthelbert's laws, but still our documents are not exhaustive\r\nenough to justify us in denying that all along there has been a class\r\n(though it can hardly have been a large class) of men who could not quit\r\ntheir tenements and yet were no slaves. As we shall see hereafter,\r\nliberty was in certain contexts reckoned a matter of degree; even the\r\n_villanus_, even the _sochemannus_ was not for every purpose _liber\r\nhomo_. When this is so, the _theów_ or _servus_ is like to appear as the\r\nunfreest of persons rather than as no person but a thing.\r\n\r\n[Prædial element in serfage.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we may guess that from a remote time there has been\r\nin the condition of the _theów_ a certain element of praediality. The\r\nslaves have not been worked in gangs nor housed in barracks[67]. The\r\n_servus_ has often been a _servus casatus_, he has had a cottage or even\r\na manse and yardland which _de facto_ he might call his own. There is\r\nhere no legal limitation of his master's power. Some slave trade there\r\nhas been; but on the whole it seems probable that the _theów_ has been\r\nusually treated as annexed to a tenement. The duties exacted of him from\r\nyear to year have remained constant. The consequence is that a free man\r\nin return for a plot of land may well agree to do all that a _theów_\r\nusually does and see in this no descent into slavery. Thus the slave\r\ngets a chance of acquiring what will be as a matter of fact a\r\n_peculium_. In the seventh century the church tried to turn this matter\r\nof fact into matter of law. 'Non licet homini,' says Theodore's\r\nPenitential, 'a servo tollere pecuniam, quam ipse labore suo\r\nadquesierit[68].' We have no reason for thinking that this effort was\r\nvery strenuous or very successful, or that the law of the eleventh\r\ncentury allowed the _servus_ any proprietary rights; and yet he might\r\noften be the occupier of land and of chattels with which, so long as he\r\ndid his customary services, his lord would seldom meddle.\r\n\r\n[The serf in criminal law.]\r\n\r\nIn the third place, we may believe that for some time past police law\r\nand punitive law have been doing something to conceal, if not to\r\nobliterate, the line which separates the slave from other men. A mature\r\njurisprudence may be able to hold fast the fundamental principle that a\r\nslave is not a person but a thing, while at the same time it both limits\r\nthe master's power of abusing his human chattel and guards against those\r\ndangers which may arise from the existence of things which have wills,\r\nand sometimes bad wills, of their own. But an immature jurisprudence is\r\nincapable of this exploit. It begins to play fast and loose with its\r\nelementary notions. It begins to punish the criminous slave without\r\nbeing quite certain as to how far it is punishing him and how far it is\r\npunishing his master. Confusion is easy, for if the slave be punished by\r\ndeath or mutilation, his master will suffer, and a pecuniary mulct\r\nexacted from the slave is exacted from his master. Learned writers have\r\ncome to the most opposite opinions as to the extent to which the\r\nAnglo-Saxon dooms by their distribution of penalties recognize the\r\npersonality of the _theów_. But this is not all. For a long time past\r\nthe law has had before it the difficult problem of dealing with crimes\r\nand delicts committed by poor and economically dependent free men, men\r\nwho have no land of their own, who are here to-day and gone to-morrow,\r\n'men from whom no right can be had.' It has been endeavouring to make\r\nthe lords answerable to a certain extent for the misdeeds of their free\r\nretainers. If a slave is charged with a crime his master is bound to\r\nproduce him in court. But the law requires that the lord shall in very\r\nsimilar fashion produce his free 'loaf eater,' his mainpast, nay, it has\r\nbeen endeavouring to enforce the rule that every free man who has no\r\nland of his own shall have a lord bound to produce him when he is\r\naccused. Also it has been fostering the growth of private justice. The\r\nlord's duty of producing his men, bond and free, has been becoming the\r\nduty of holding a court in which his men, free and bond, will answer for\r\nthemselves. How far this process had gone in the days of the Confessor\r\nis a question to which we shall return[69].\r\n\r\n[Serf and villein.]\r\n\r\nFor all this however, we may say with certainty that in the eleventh\r\ncentury the _servi_ were marked off from all other men by definite legal\r\nlines. What is more, we may say that every man who was not a _theów_ was\r\nin some definite legal sense a free man. This sharp contrast is put\r\nbefore us by the laws of Cnut as well as by those of his predecessors.\r\nIf a freeman works on a holiday, he pays for it with his _healsfang_; if\r\na _theówman_ does the like, he pays for it with his hide or his\r\nhide-geld[70]. Equally sharp is the same distinction in the Leges\r\nHenrici, and this too in passages which, so far as we know, are not\r\nborrowed from Anglo-Saxon documents. For many purposes 'aut servus aut\r\nliber homo' is a perfect dilemma. There is no confusion whatever between\r\nthe _villani_ and the _servi_. The _villani_ are 'viles et inopes\r\npersonae' but clearly enough they are _liberi homines_. So also in the\r\nQuadripartitus, the Latin translation of the ancient dooms made in Henry\r\nI.'s reign, there is no confusion about this matter; the _theówman_\r\nbecomes a _servus_, while _villanus_ is the equivalent for _ceorl_. The\r\nNorman writers still tell how according to the old law of the English\r\nthe _villanus_ might become a thegn if he acquired five hides of\r\nland[71]; at times they will put before us _villani_ and _thaini_ or\r\neven _villani_ and _barones_ as an exhaustive classification of free\r\nmen[72].\r\n\r\n[The serf of the Leges.]\r\n\r\nLet us learn what may be learnt of the _servus_ from the Leges Henrici.\r\nEvery man is either a _liber homo_ or a _servus_[73]. Free men are\r\neither two-hundred-men or twelve-hundred-men; perhaps we ought to add\r\nthat there is also a class of six-hundred-men[74]. A serf becomes such\r\neither by birth or by some event, such as a sale into slavery, that\r\nhappens in his lifetime[75]. Servile blood is transmitted from father to\r\nchild; some lords hold that it is also transmitted by mother to\r\nchild[76]. If a slave is to be freed this should be done publicly, in\r\ncourt, or church or market, and lance and helmet or other the arms of\r\nfree men should be given him, while he should give his lord thirty\r\npence, that is the price of his skin, as a sign that he is henceforth\r\n'worthy of his hide.' On the other hand, when a free man falls into\r\nslavery then also there should be a public ceremony. He should put his\r\nhead between his lord's hands and should receive as the arms of slavery\r\nsome bill-hook or the like[77]. Public ceremonies are requisite, for the\r\nstate is endangered by the uncertain condition of accused criminals; the\r\nlords will assert at one moment that their men are free and at the next\r\nmoment that these same men are slaves[78]. The descent of a free man\r\ninto slavery is treated as no uncommon event; the slave may well have\r\nfree kinsfolk[79]. But, to come to the fundamental rule, the _villanus_,\r\nthe meanest of free men, is a two-hundred-man, that is to say, if he be\r\nslain the very substantial wergild of 200 Saxon shillings or £4 must be\r\npaid to his kinsfolk[80], while a man-bót of 30 shillings is paid to his\r\nlord[81]. But if a _servus_ be slain his kinsfolk receive the\r\ncomparatively trifling sum of 40 pence while the lord gets the man-bót\r\nof 20 shillings[82]. That the serf's kinsfolk should receive a small sum\r\nneed not surprise us. Germanic law has never found it easy to carry the\r\nprinciple that the slave is a chattel to extreme conclusions; but the\r\npayment seems trifling and half contemptuous; at any rate the life of\r\nthe villein is worth the life of twenty-four serfs[83]. Then again, it\r\nis by no means certain that a lord can not kill his serf with impunity.\r\n'If,' says our text, 'a man slay his own serf, his is the sin and his is\r\nthe loss':--we may interpret this to mean that he has sinned but sinned\r\nagainst himself[84]. Then again, for the evil deeds of his slave the\r\nmaster is in some degree responsible. If my slave be guilty of a petty\r\ntheft not worthy of death, I am bound to make restitution; if the crime\r\nbe a capital one and he be taken handhaving, then he must 'die like a\r\nfree man[85].' If my slave be guilty of homicide, my duty is to set him\r\nfree and hand him over to the kindred of the slain, but apparently I may\r\npurchase his life by a sum of 40 shillings, a sum much less than the\r\n_wer_ of the slain man[86]. We must not be too hard on the owners of\r\ndelinquent slaves. There are cases, for example, in which, several\r\nslaves having committed a crime, one of them chosen by lot must suffer\r\nfor the sins of all[87]. Our author is borrowing from the laws of\r\nseveral different centuries and does not arrive at any neat result; nor\r\nmust we wonder at this, for the problems presented to jurisprudence by\r\nthe crimes and delicts of slaves are very intricate. Then again, we have\r\nthe rule that if free men and serfs join in a crime, the whole guilt is\r\nto be attributed to the free: he who joins with a slave in a theft has\r\nno companion[88]. On the whole, though the slave is likely to have as a\r\nmatter of fact a _peculium_ of his own, a _peculium_ out of which he may\r\nbe able to pay for his offences and even perhaps to purchase his\r\nliberty[89], the _servus_ of our Leges seems to be in the main a\r\nrightless being. We look in vain for any trace of that idea of the\r\nrelativity of servitude which becomes the core of Bracton's\r\ndoctrine[90]. At the same time we observe that many, perhaps most, of\r\nthe rules which mark the slavish condition of the serf are ancient rules\r\nand rules that are becoming obsolete. In the twelfth century the old\r\nsystem of _wer_ and _bót_ is already vanishing, though an antiquarian\r\nlawyer may yet try to revivify it. When it disappears altogether before\r\nthe new law, which holds every grave crime to be a felony, and punishes\r\nalmost every felony with death[91], many grand differences between the\r\nvillein and the serf will have perished. The gallows is a great\r\nleveller.\r\n\r\n[Return to the _servus_ of Domesday.]\r\n\r\nIf now we recur to the days of the Conquest, we cannot doubt that the\r\nlaw knew a definite class of slaves, and marked them off by many\r\ndistinctions from the _villani_ and _cotarii_, and even from the\r\n_coliberti_. Sums that seem high were being paid for men whose freedom\r\nwas being purchased[92]. At Lewes the toll paid for the sale of an ox\r\nwas a halfpenny; on the sale of a man it was fourpence[93]. In later\r\ndocuments we may sometimes see a distinction well drawn. Thus in the\r\nBlack Book of Peterborough, compiled in 1127 or thereabouts, we may read\r\nhow on one of his manors the abbot has eight herdsmen (_bovarii_), how\r\neach of them holds ten acres, has to do labour services and render\r\nloaves and poultry. And then we read that each of them must pay one\r\npenny for his head if he be a free man (_liber homo_), while he pays\r\nnothing if he be a _servus_[94]. This is a well-drawn distinction. Of\r\ntwo men whose economic position is precisely the same, the one may be\r\nfree, the other a slave, and it is the free man, not the slave, who has\r\nto pay a head-penny. Now when the Conqueror's surveyors, or rather the\r\njurors, call a man a _servus_ they are, so it seems to us, thinking\r\nrather of his legal status than of his position in the economy of a\r\nmanor. At any rate we ought to observe that the economic stratification\r\nof society may cut the legal stratification. We are accustomed perhaps\r\nto suppose that while the _villani_ have lands that are in some sense\r\ntheir own, while they support themselves and their families by tilling\r\nthose lands, the _servus_ has no land that is in any sense his own, but\r\nis fed at his lord's board, is housed in his lord's court, and spends\r\nall his time in the cultivation of his lord's demesne lands. Such may\r\nhave been the case in those parts of England where we hear of but few\r\n_servi_; those few may have been inmates of the lord's house and have\r\nhad no plots of their own. But such can hardly have been the case in the\r\nsouth-western counties; the _servi_ are too many to be menials. Indeed\r\nit would seem that these _servi_ sometimes had arable plots, and had\r\noxen, which were to be distinguished from the demesne oxen of their\r\nlords--not indeed as a matter of law, but as a matter of economic\r\nusage[95]. It is plain that the legal and the economic lines may\r\nintersect one another; the menial who is fed by the lord and who must\r\ngive his whole time to the lord's work may be a free man; the slave may\r\nhave a cottage and oxen and a plot of arable land, and labour for\r\nhimself as well labouring for his lord. Hence a perplexed and uncertain\r\nterminology:--the _servus_ who has land and oxen may be casually called\r\na _villanus_[96], and we cannot be sure that no one whom our record\r\ncalls a _servus_ has the wergild of a free man. Nor can we be sure that\r\nthe enumeration of the _servi_ is always governed by one consistent\r\nprinciple. In the shires of Gloucester, Hereford and Worcester we read\r\nof numerous _ancillae_--in Worcestershire of 677 _servi_ and 101\r\n_ancillae_[97]--and this may make us think that in this district all the\r\nable-bodied serfs are enumerated, whether or no they have cottages to\r\nthemselves[98]. We may strongly suspect that the king's commissioners\r\nwere not much interested in the line that separated the _villani_ from\r\nthe _servi_, since the lord was as directly answerable for the geld of\r\nany lands that were in the occupation of his villeins as he was for the\r\ngeld of those plots that were tilled for him by his slaves. That there\r\nshould have been never a _theów_ in all Yorkshire and Lincolnshire is\r\nhardly credible, and yet we hear of no _servi_ in those counties.\r\n\r\n[Disappearance of _servi_.]\r\n\r\nThis being so, we encounter some difficulty if we would put just the\r\nright interpretation on a remarkable fact that is visible in Essex. The\r\ndescription of that county tells us not only how many _villani_,\r\n_bordarii_ and _servi_ there are now, but also how many there were in\r\nKing Edward's day, and thus shows what changes have taken place during\r\nthe last twenty years. Now on manor after manor the number of villeins\r\nand bordiers, if of them we make one class, has increased, while the\r\nnumber of _servi_ has fallen. We take 100 entries (four batches of 25\r\napiece) and see that the number of _villani_ and _bordarii_ has risen\r\nfrom 1486 to 1894, while the number of _servi_ has fallen from 423 to\r\n303. We make another experiment with a hundred entries. This gives the\r\nfollowing result:--\r\n\r\n                           1066    1086\r\n               Villani     1273    1247\r\n               Bordarii     810    1241\r\n               Servi        384     312\r\n\r\nThis decrease in the number of _servi_ seems to be pretty evenly\r\ndistributed throughout the county[99]. We shall not readily ascribe the\r\nchange to any mildheartedness of the lords. They are Frenchmen, and in\r\nall probability they have got the most they could out of a mass of\r\npeasantry made malleable and manageable by the Conquest. We may rather\r\nbe entitled to infer that there has been a considerable change in rural\r\neconomy. For the cultivation of his demesne land the lord begins to rely\r\nless and less on the labour of serfs whom he feeds, more and more upon\r\nthe labour of tenants who have plots of their own and who feed\r\nthemselves. From this again we may perhaps infer that the labour\r\nservices of the _villani_ and _bordarii_ are being augmented. But at any\r\nrate it speaks ill of their fate, that under the sway of foreigners, who\r\nmay fairly be suspected of some harshness and greed, their inferiors,\r\nthe true _servi_, are somewhat rapidly disappearing. However, it is by\r\nno means impossible that with a slavery so complete as that of the\r\nEnglish _theów_ the Normans were not very familiar in their own\r\ncountry[100].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [61] Hist.

Maurer holds that the Anglo-Saxon slave is in the main\r\n       a chattel, that _e.g._ the master must answer for the delicts\r\n       of his slave in the same way that the owner answers for damage\r\n       done by his beasts, and that this liability can be clearly\r\n       marked off from the duty of the lord of free retainers who is\r\n       merely bound to produce them in court.

Compare\r\n       Ancient Laws of Wales, i. 239, 511; the bondman has no\r\n       _galanas_ (wergild) but if injured he receives a _saraad_; 'the\r\n       saraad of a bondman is twelve pence, six for a coat for him,\r\n       three for trousers, one for buskins, one for a hook and one for\r\n       a rope, and if he be a woodman let the hook-penny be for an\r\n       axe.'

Eng. Law, i. 53-4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Villeins._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The boors or coliberts.]\r\n\r\nNext above the _servi_ we see the small but interesting class of _buri_,\r\n_burs_ or _coliberti_. Probably it was not mentioned in the writ which\r\nset the commissioners their task, and this may well be the reason why it\r\nappears as but a very small class. It has some 900 members; still it is\r\nrepresented in fourteen shires: Hampshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorset,\r\nSomerset, Devon, Cornwall, Buckingham, Oxford, Gloucester, Worcester,\r\nHereford, Warwick, Shropshire--in short, in the shires of Wessex and\r\nwestern Mercia. Twice over our record explains--a piece of rare good\r\nfortune--that _buri_ and _coliberti_ are all one[101]. In general they\r\nare presented to us as being akin rather to the _servi_ than to the\r\n_villani_ or _bordarii_, as when we are told, 'In demesne there is one\r\nvirgate of land and there are 3 teams and 11 _servi_ and 5 _coliberti_,\r\nand there are 15 _villani_ and 15 _bordarii_ with 8 teams[102].' But\r\nthis rule is by no means unbroken; sometimes the _coliberti_ are\r\nseparated from the _servi_ and a precedence over the _cotarii_ or even\r\nover the _bordarii_ is given them. Thus of a Wiltshire manor it is\r\nwritten, 'In demesne there are 8 teams and 20 _servi_ and 41 _villani_\r\nand 30 _bordarii_ and 7 _coliberti_ and 74 _cotarii_ have among them all\r\n27 teams[103].' Again of a Warwickshire manor, 'There is land for 26\r\nteams; in demesne are 3 teams and 4 _servi_ and 43 _villani_ and 6\r\n_coliberti_ and 10 _bordarii_ with 16 teams[104].' A classification\r\nwhich turns upon legal status is cut by a classification which turns\r\nupon economic condition. The _colibertus_ we take to be an unfreer man\r\n(how there come to be degrees of freedom is a question to be asked by\r\nand by) than the _cotarius_ or the _bordarius_, but on a given manor he\r\nmay be a more important person, for he may have plough beasts while the\r\n_cotarius_ has none, he may have two oxen while the _bordarius_ has but\r\nan ox.\r\n\r\n[The Continental colibert.]\r\n\r\n[The English boor.]\r\n\r\nIn calling him a _colibertus_ the Norman clerks are giving him a foreign\r\nname, the etymological origin of which is very dark[105]; but this much\r\nseems plain, that in the France of the eleventh century a large class\r\nbearing this name had been formed out of ancient elements, Roman\r\n_coloni_ and Germanic _liti_, a class which was not rightless (for it\r\ncould be distinguished from the class of _servi_, and a _colibertus_\r\nmight be made a _servus_ by way of punishment for his crimes) but which\r\nyet was unfree, for the _colibertus_ who left his lord might be pursued\r\nand recaptured[106]. As to the Englishman upon whom this name is\r\nbestowed we know him to be a _gebúr_, a boor, and we learn something of\r\nhim from that mysterious document entitled 'Rectitudines Singularum\r\nPersonarum[107].' His services, we are told, vary from place to place;\r\nin some districts he works for his lord two days a week and during\r\nharvest-time three days a week; he pays gafol in money, barley, sheep\r\nand poultry; also he has ploughing to do besides his week-work; he pays\r\nhearth-penny; he and one of his fellows must between them feed a dog. It\r\nis usual to provide him with an outfit of two oxen, one cow, six sheep,\r\nand seed for seven acres of his yardland, and also to provide him with\r\nhousehold stuff; on his death all these chattels go back to his lord.\r\nThus the boor is put before us as a tenant with a house and a yardland\r\nor virgate, and two plough oxen. He will therefore play a more important\r\npart in the manorial economy than the cottager who has no beasts. But he\r\nis a very dependent person; his beasts, even the poor furniture of his\r\nhouse, his pots and crocks, are provided for him by his lord. Probably\r\nit is this that marks him off from the ordinary _villanus_ or\r\n'townsman,' and brings him near the serf. In a sense he may be a free\r\nman. We have seen how the law, whether we look for it to the code of\r\nCnut or to the Leges Henrici, is holding fast the proposition that every\r\none who is not a _theówman_ is a free man, that every one is either a\r\n_liber homo_ or a _servus_. We have no warrant for denying to the boor\r\nthe full wergild of 200 shillings. He pays the hearth-penny, or Peter's\r\npenny, and the document that tells us this elsewhere mentions this\r\npayment as the mark of a free man[108]. And yet in a very true and\r\naccurate sense he may be unfree, unfree to quit his lord's service. All\r\nthat he has belongs to his lord; he must be perpetually in debt to his\r\nlord; he could hardly leave his lord without being guilty of something\r\nvery like theft, an abstraction of chattels committed to his charge.\r\nVery probably if he flies, his lord has a right to recapture him. On the\r\nother hand, so dependent a man will be in a very strict sense a tenant\r\nat will. When he dies not only his tenement but his stock will belong to\r\nthe lord; like the French _colibert_ he is _mainmortable_. At the same\r\ntime, to one familiar with the cartularies of the thirteenth century the\r\nrents and services that this boor has to pay and perform for his virgate\r\nwill not appear enormous. If we mistake not, many a _villanus_ of Henry\r\nIII.'s day would have thought them light. Of course any such comparison\r\nis beset by difficulties, for at present we know all too little of the\r\nhistory of wages and prices. Nevertheless the intermediation of this\r\nclass of _buri_ or _coliberti_ between the serfs and the villeins of\r\nDomesday Book must tend to raise our estimate both of the legal freedom\r\nand of the economic welfare of that great mass of peasants which is now\r\nto come before us[109].\r\n\r\n[Villani, bordarii, cotarii.]\r\n\r\nThat great mass consists of some 108,500 _villani_, some 82,600\r\n_bordarii_, and some 6,800 _cotarii_ and _coscets_[110]. Though in manor\r\nafter manor we may find representatives of each of these three classes,\r\nwe can see that for some important purpose they form but one grand\r\nclass, and that the term _villanus_ may be used to cover the whole genus\r\nas well as to designate one of its three species. In the Exon Domesday\r\na common formula, having stated the number of hides in the manor and the\r\nnumber of teams for which it can find work, proceeds to divide the land\r\nand the existing teams between the demesne and the _villani_--the\r\n_villani_, it will say, have so many hides and so many teams. Then it\r\nwill state how many _villani_, _bordarii_, _cotarii_ there are. But it\r\nwill sometimes fall out that there are no _villani_ if that term is to\r\nbe used in its specific sense, and so, after having been told that the\r\n_villani_ have so much land and so many teams, we learn that the only\r\n_villani_ on this manor are _bordarii_[111]. The lines which divide the\r\nthree species are, we may be sure, much rather economic than legal\r\nlines. Of course the law may recognise them upon occasion[112], but we\r\ncan not say that the _bordarius_ has a different status from that of the\r\n_villanus_. In the Leges both fall under the term _villani_; indeed, as\r\nhereafter will be seen, that term has sometimes to cover all men who are\r\nnot _servi_ but are not noble. Nor must we suppose that the economic\r\nlines are drawn with much precision or according to any one uniform\r\npattern. Of _villani_ and _bordarii_ we may read in every county;\r\n_cotarii_ or _coscets_ in considerable numbers are found only in Kent,\r\nSussex, Surrey, Middlesex, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Berkshire,\r\nHertford and Cambridge, though they are not absolutely unknown in\r\nBuckingham, in Devon, in Hereford, Worcester, Shropshire, Yorkshire. We\r\ncan not tell how the English jurors would have expressed the distinction\r\nbetween _bordarii_ and _cotarii_, for while the _cot_ is English, the\r\n_borde_ is French. If we are entitled to draw any inference from the\r\ndistribution of the cottiers, it would be that the smallest of small\r\ntenements were to be found chiefly along the southern shore; but then\r\nthere are no _cotarii_ in Hampshire, plenty in Sussex, Surrey, Wiltshire\r\nand Dorset. Again, in the two shires last mentioned some distinction\r\nseems to be taken between the _coscets_ and the _cotarii_, the former\r\nbeing superior to the latter[113]. Two centuries later we find a similar\r\ndistinction among the tenants of Worcester Priory. There are _cotmanni_\r\nwhose rents and services are heavier, and whose tenements are\r\npresumably larger than those of the _cotarii_, though the difference is\r\nnot very great[114].\r\n\r\n[Size of the villain's tenement.]\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of distinctions such as these is well illustrated by the\r\nfailure of the term _bordarius_ (and none is more prominent in Domesday\r\nBook) to take firm root in this country[115]. The successors of the\r\n_bordarii_ seem to become in the later documents either _villani_ with\r\nsmall or cottiers with large tenements. Distinctions which turn on the\r\namount of land that is possessed or the amount of service that is done\r\ncannot be accurately formulated and forced upon a whole country. Perhaps\r\nin general we may endow the _villanus_ of Domesday Book with a virgate\r\nor quarter of a hide, while we ascribe to the _bordarius_ a less\r\nquantity and doubt whether the _cotarius_ usually had arable land. But\r\nthe survey of Middlesex, which is the main authority touching this\r\nmatter, shows that the _villanus_ may on occasion have a whole\r\nhide[116], that is four virgates, and that often he has but half a\r\nvirgate; it shows us that the _bordarius_, though often he has but four\r\nor five acres, may have a half virgate, that is as much as many a\r\n_villanus_[117]; it shows us that the _cotarius_ may have five acres,\r\nthat is as much as many a _bordarius_[118], though he will often have no\r\nmore than a croft[119]. In Essex we hear of _bordarii_ who held no\r\narable land[120]. Nor dare we lay down any stern rule about the\r\npossession of plough beasts. It would seem as if sometimes the\r\n_bordarius_ had oxen, while sometimes he had none[121]. The _villanus_\r\nmight have two oxen, but he might have more or less. We may find that\r\nin Cornwall a single team of eight is forthcoming where there are[122]\r\n\r\n               3 villani, 4 bordarii, 2 servi\r\n               2    \"     2    \"      3   \"\r\n               0    \"     5    \"      2   \"\r\n               1    \"     5    \"      1   \"\r\n               2    \"     5    \"      4   \"\r\n               2    \"     3    \"      1   \"\r\n               3    \"     6    \"      3   \"\r\n\r\nIn some Gloucestershire manors every villein seems to have a full plough\r\nteam[123]. Merely economic grades are essentially indefinite. Who could\r\nhave defined a 'cottage' in the eleventh century? Who can define one\r\nnow[124]?\r\n\r\n[Villeins and cottiers.]\r\n\r\nIn truth the vast class of men that we are examining must have been\r\nheterogeneous to a high degree. Not only were some members of it much\r\nwealthier than others, but in all probability some were economically\r\nsubject to others. So it was in later days. In the thirteenth century we\r\nmay easily find a manor in which the lord is paying hardly any wages. He\r\ngets nearly all his agricultural work done for him by his villeins and\r\nhis cottiers. Out of his cottiers however he will get but one day's work\r\nin the week. If then we ask what the cottiers are doing during the rest\r\nof their time, the answer surely must be that they are often working as\r\nhired labourers on the villein's virgates, for a cottier can not have\r\nspent five days in the week over the tillage of his poor little\r\ntenement. It is a remarkable feature of the manorial arrangement that\r\nthe meanest of the lord's _nativi_ are but rarely working for him. Thus\r\nif we were to remove the lord in order that the village community might\r\nbe revealed, we should still see not only rich and poor, but employers\r\nand employed, villagers and 'undersettles.'\r\n\r\n[Freedom and unfreedom of _villani_.]\r\n\r\nNow all these people are in a sense unfree, while yet in some other\r\nsense they are free. Let us then spend a short while in discussing the\r\nvarious meanings that freedom may have in a legal classification of the\r\nsorts and conditions of men. When we have put out of account the\r\nrightless slave, who is a thing, it still remains possible to say that\r\nsome men are unfree, while others are free, and even that freedom is a\r\nmatter of degree. But we may use various standards for the measurement\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\n[Meaning of freedom.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the first place we shall think of what German writers call\r\n_Freizügigkeit_, the power to leave the master whom one has been\r\nserving. This power our ancestors would perhaps have called\r\n'fare-worthiness[125].' If the master has the right to recapture the\r\nservant who leaves his service, or even if he has the right to call upon\r\nthe officers of the state to pursue him and bring him back to his work,\r\nthen we may account this servant an unfree man, albeit the relation\r\nbetween him and his master has been created by free contract. Such\r\nunfreedom is very distinct from rightlessness. As a freak of\r\njurisprudence we might imagine a modern nobleman entitled to reduce by\r\nforce and arms his fugitive butler to well-paid and easy duties, while\r\nall the same that butler had rights against all the world including his\r\nmaster, had access to all courts, and could even sue for his wages if\r\nthey were not punctually paid. If we call him unfree, then freedom will\r\nlook like a matter of degree, for the master's power to get back his\r\nfugitive may be defined by law in divers manners. May he go in pursuit\r\nand use force? Must he send a constable or sheriff's officer? Must he\r\nfirst go to court and obtain a judgment, 'a decree for specific\r\nperformance' of the contract of service? The right of recapture seems to\r\nshade off gradually into a right to insist that a breach of the contract\r\nof service is a criminal offence to be punished by fine or imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThen, again, there may seem to us to be more of unfreedom in the case of\r\none who was born a servant than in the case of one who has contracted to\r\nserve, though we should note that one may be born to serve without being\r\nborn rightless.\r\n\r\nMore to the point than these obvious reflections will be the remark that\r\nin the thirteenth century we learn to think of various spheres or planes\r\nof justice. A right good in one sphere may have no existence in\r\nanother. The rights of the villeins in their tenements are sanctioned by\r\nmanorial justice; they are ignored by the king's courts. Here, again,\r\nthe ideas of freedom and unfreedom find a part to play. True that in the\r\norder of legal logic freedom may precede royal protection; a tenure is\r\nprotected because it is free; still men are soon arguing that it is free\r\nbecause it is protected, and this probably discloses an idea which lies\r\ndeep[126]:--the king's courts, the national courts, are open to the\r\nfree; we approach the rightlessness of the slave if our rights are\r\nrecognized only in a court of which our lord is the president.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth century will also supply us with the notion that\r\ncontinuous agricultural service, service in which there is a\r\nconsiderable element of uncertainty, is unfree service. Where from day\r\nto day the lord's will counts for much in determining the work that his\r\ntenants must do, such tenants, even if they be free men, are not holding\r\nfreely. But uncertainty is a matter of degree, and therefore unfreedom\r\nmay easily be regarded as a matter of degree[127].\r\n\r\nThen, again, in the law books of the Norman age we see distinct traces\r\nof a usage which would make _liber_ or _liberalis_ an equivalent for our\r\n_noble_, or at least for our _gentle_. The common man with the wergild\r\nof 200 shillings, though indubitably he is no _servus_, is not\r\n_liberalis homo_[128].\r\n\r\nLastly, in our thirteenth century we learn that privileges and\r\nexceptional immunities are 'liberties' and 'franchises.' What is our\r\ndefinition of a liberty, a franchise? A portion of royal power in the\r\nhands of a subject. In Henry III.'s day we do not say that the Earl of\r\nChester is a freer man, more of a _liber homo_, than is the Earl of\r\nGloucester, but we do say that he has more, greater, higher liberties.\r\n\r\nTherefore we shall not be surprised if in Domesday Book what we read of\r\nfreedom, of free men, of free land is sadly obscure. Let us then observe\r\nthat the _villanus_ both is and is not a free man.\r\n\r\n[The villein as free.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the usual terminology of the Leges, everyone who is above\r\nthe rank of a _servus_, but below the rank of a thegn, is a _villanus_.\r\nThe _villanus_ is the non-noble _liber homo_. All those numerous\r\nsokemen of the eastern counties whom Domesday ranks above the _villani_,\r\nall those numerous _liberi homines_ whom it ranks above the sokemen,\r\nare, according to this scheme, _villani_ if they be not thegns. And this\r\nscheme is still of great importance, for it is the scheme of _bót_ and\r\n_wer_. By what have been the most vital of all the rules of law, all\r\nthese men have been massed together; each of them has a _wer_ of two\r\nhundred shillings[129]. This, we may remark in passing, is no trivial\r\nsum, though the shillings are the small Saxon shillings of four pence or\r\nfive pence. There seems to be a good deal of evidence that for a long\r\ntime past the ox had been valued at 30 pence, the sheep at 5 pence[130].\r\nAt this rate the ceorl's death must be paid for by the price of some\r\ntwenty-four or thirty oxen. The sons of a _villanus_ who had but two\r\noxen must have been under some temptation to wish that their father\r\nwould get himself killed by a solvent thegn. Very rarely indeed do the\r\nLeges notice the sokeman or mention _liberi homines_ so as to exclude\r\nthe _villani_ from the scope of that term[131]. Domesday Book also on\r\noccasion can divide mankind into slaves and free men. It does so when it\r\ntells us that on a Gloucestershire manor there were twelve _servi_ whom\r\nthe lord had made free[132]. It does so again when it tells us that in\r\nthe city of Chester the bishop had eight shillings if a free man, four\r\nshillings if a serf, did work upon a festival[133]. So in a description\r\nof the manor of South Perrott in Somerset we read that a certain custom\r\nis due to it from the manor of 'Cruche' (Crewkerne), namely, that every\r\nfree man must render one bloom of iron. We look for these free men at\r\n'Cruche' and see no one on the manor but _villani_, _bordarii_,\r\n_coliberti_ and _servi_[134]. Of the Count of Mortain's manor of\r\nBickenhall it is written that every free man renders a bloom of iron at\r\nthe king's manor of Curry; but at Bickenhall there is no one above the\r\ncondition of a _villanus_[135]. Other passages will suggest that the\r\n_villanus_ sometimes is and sometimes is not _liber homo_. On a Norfolk\r\nmanor we find free villeins, _liberi villani_[136].\r\n\r\n[The villein as unfree.]\r\n\r\nFor all this, however, there must be some very important sense in which\r\nthe _villanus_ is not free. In the survey of the eastern counties he is\r\nseparated from the _liberi homines_ by the whole class of _sochemanni_.\r\n'In this manor,' we are told, 'there was at that time a free man with\r\nhalf a hide who has now been made one of the villeins[137].' At times\r\nthe word _francus_ is introduced so as to suggest for a moment that,\r\nthough the villein may be _liber homo_, he is not _francus_[138]. But\r\nthis suggestion, even if it be made, is not maintained, and there are\r\nhundreds of passages which implicitly deny that the villein is _liber\r\nhomo_. But then these passages draw the line between freedom and\r\nunfreedom at a point high in the legal scale, a point far above the\r\nheads of the _villani_. At least for the main purposes of Domesday Book\r\nthe free man is a man who holds land freely. Let us observe what is said\r\nof the men who have been holding manors. The formula will vary somewhat\r\nfrom county to county, but we shall often find four phrases used as\r\nequivalent, '_X_ tenuit et liber homo fuit,' '_X_ tenuit ut liber homo,'\r\n'_X_ tenuit et cum terra sua liber fuit,' '_X_ tenuit libere[139].' But\r\nthis freeholding implies a high degree of freedom, freedom of a kind\r\nthat would have shocked the lawyers of a later age.\r\n\r\n[Anglo-Saxon 'freeholding.']\r\n\r\nWith some regrets we must leave the peasants for a while in order that\r\nwe may glance at the higher strata of society. We may take it as certain\r\nthat, at least in the eyes of William's ministers, the ordinary holder\r\nof a manor in the time of the Confessor had been holding it under\r\n(_sub_) some lord, if not of (_de_) some lord. But then the closeness of\r\nthe connexion between him and his lord, the character of the relation\r\nbetween lord, man and land, had varied much from case to case. Now these\r\nmatters are often expressed in terms of a calculus of personal freedom.\r\nBut let us begin with some phrases which seem intelligible enough. The\r\nman can, or he can not, 'sell or give his land'; he can, or he can not,\r\n'sell or give it without the licence of his lord'; he can sell it if he\r\nhas first offered it to his lord[140]; he can sell it on paying his lord\r\ntwo shillings[141]. This seems very simple:--the lord can, or (as the\r\ncase may be) can not, prevent his tenant from alienating the land; he\r\nhas a right of preemption or he has a right to exact a fine when there\r\nis a change of tenants. But then come phrases that are less in harmony\r\nwith our idea of feudal tenure. The man can not sell his land 'away\r\nfrom' his lord[142], he can not give or sell it 'outside' a certain\r\nmanor belonging to his lord[143], or, being the tenant of some church,\r\nhe can not 'separate' his land from the church[144], or give or sell it\r\noutside the church[145].\r\n\r\n[Freeholding and the lord's rights.]\r\n\r\nWe have perhaps taken for granted under the influence of later law that\r\nan alienation will not impair the lord's rights, and will but give him a\r\nnew instead of an old tenant. But it is not of any mere substitution\r\nsuch as this that these men of the eleventh century are thinking. They\r\nhave it in their minds that the man may wish, may be able, utterly to\r\nwithdraw his land from the sphere of his lord's rights. Therefore in\r\nmany cases they note with some care that the man, though he can give or\r\nsell his land, can not altogether put an end to such relation as has\r\nexisted between this land and his lord. He can sell, but some of the\r\nlord's rights will 'remain,' in particular the lord's 'soke' over the\r\nland (for the present let us say his jurisdiction over the land) will\r\nremain[146]. The purchaser will not of necessity become the 'man' of\r\nthis lord, will not of necessity owe him any _servitium_ or\r\n_consuetudo_, but will come under his jurisdiction[147]. Interchanging\r\nhowever with these phrases[148], we have others which seem to point to\r\nthe same set of distinctions, but to express them in terms of personal\r\nfreedom. The man can, or else he can not, withdraw from his lord, go\r\naway from his lord, withdraw from his lord's manor; he can or he can not\r\nwithdraw with his land; he can or can not go to another lord, or go\r\nwherever he pleases[149]. Some of these phrases will, if taken\r\nliterally, seem to say that the persons of whom they are used are tied\r\nto the soil; they can not leave the land, or the manor, or the soke.\r\nProbably in some of these cases the bond between man and lord is a\r\nperpetual bond of homage and fealty, and if the man breaks that bond by\r\nrefusing the due obedience or putting himself under another lord, he is\r\nguilty of a wrong[150]. But of pursuing him and capturing him and\r\nreducing him to servitude there can be no talk. Many of these persons\r\nwho 'can not recede' are men of wealth and rank, of high rank that is\r\nrecognized by law, they are king's thegns or the thegns of the churches,\r\nthey are 'twelve-hundred men[151].' However, it is not the man's power\r\nto leave his lord so much as the power to leave his lord and take his\r\nland with him, that these phrases bring to our notice; or rather the\r\nassumption is made that no one will want to leave his lord if he must\r\nalso leave his land behind him. And then this power of taking land from\r\nthis lord and bringing it under another lord is conceived as an index of\r\npersonal freedom. Thus we read: 'These men were so free that they could\r\ngo where they pleased[152],' and again, 'Four sokemen held this land,\r\nof whom three were free, while the fourth held one hide but could not\r\ngive or sell it[153].' Not that no one is called a _liber homo_ unless\r\nhe has this power of 'receding' from his lord; far from it; all is a\r\nmatter of degree; but the free man is freer if he can 'go to what lord\r\nhe pleases,' and often enough the phrases 'X tenuit et liber homo fuit,'\r\n'X tenuit libere,' 'X tenuit ut liber homo' seem to have no other\r\nmeaning than this, that the occupant of the land enjoyed the liberty of\r\ntaking it with him whithersoever he would. Therefore there is no\r\ntautology in saying that the holder of the land was a thegn and a free\r\nman, though of course there is a sense, there are many senses, in which\r\nevery thegn is free[154]. All this talk of the freedom that consists in\r\nchoosing a lord and subjecting land to him may well puzzle us, for it\r\npuzzled the men of the twelfth century. The chronicler of Abingdon abbey\r\nhad to explain that in the old days a free man could do strange\r\nthings[155].\r\n\r\n[The scale of freeholding.]\r\n\r\nComparisons may be instituted between the freedom of one free man and\r\nthat of another:--'Five thegns held this land of Earl Edwin and could go\r\nwith their land whither they would, and below them they had four\r\nsoldiers, who were as free as themselves[156].' A high degree of liberty\r\nis marked when we are told that, 'The said men were so free that they\r\ncould sell their land with soke and sake wherever they would[157].' But\r\nthere are yet higher degrees of liberty. Of Worcestershire it is\r\nwritten, 'When the king goes upon a military expedition, if anyone who\r\nis summoned stays at home, then if he is so free a man that he has his\r\nsake and soke and can go whither he pleases with his land, he with all\r\nhis land shall be in the king's mercy[158].' The free man is the freer\r\nif he has soke and sake, if he has jurisdiction over other men.\r\nExceptional privileges, immunities from common burdens, are already\r\nregarded as 'liberties.' This is no new thing; often enough when the\r\nAnglo-Saxon land books speak of freedom they mean privilege.\r\n\r\n[Free land.]\r\n\r\nThe idea of freedom is equally vague and elastic if, instead of applying\r\nit to men, we apply it to land or the tenure of land. Two _bordarii_ are\r\nnow holding a small plot; 'they themselves held it freely in King\r\nEdward's day[159].' Here no doubt there has been a fall; but how deep a\r\nfall we can not be sure. To say that a man's land is free may imply far\r\nmore freedom than freehold tenure implies in later times; it may imply\r\nthat the bond between him and his lord, if indeed he has a lord, is of a\r\npurely personal character and hardly gives the lord any hold over the\r\nland[160]. But this is not all. Perfect freedom is not attained so long\r\nas the land owes any single duty to the state. Often enough--but exactly\r\nhow often it were no easy task to tell--the _libera terra_ of our record\r\nis land that has been exempted even from the danegeld; it is highly\r\nprivileged land[161]. Let us remember that at the present day, though\r\nthe definition of free land or freehold land has long ago been fixed, we\r\nstill speak as though free land might become freer if it were 'free of\r\nland-tax and tithe rent-charge.'\r\n\r\n[The unfreedom of the villein.]\r\n\r\nIf now we return to the _villanus_ and deny that he is _liber homo_ and\r\ndeny also that he is holding freely, we shall be saying little and using\r\nthe laxest of terms. There are half-a-dozen questions that we would fain\r\nask about him, and there will be no harm in asking them, though Domesday\r\nBook is taciturn.\r\n\r\n[Can the villein be pursued?]\r\n\r\nIs he free to quit his lord and his land, or can he be pursued and\r\ncaptured? No one word can be obtained in answer to this question. We can\r\nonly say that in Henry II.'s day the ordinary peasant was regarded by\r\nthe royal officials as _ascriptitius_; the land that he occupied was\r\nsaid to be part of his lord's demesne; his chattels were his\r\nlord's[162]. But then this was conceived to be, at least in some degree,\r\nthe result of the Norman Conquest and subsequent rebellions of the\r\npeasantry[163]. To this we may add that in one of our sets of Leges, the\r\nFrench Leis of William the Conqueror, there are certain clauses which\r\nwould be of great importance could we suppose that they had an\r\nauthoritative origin, and which in any case are remarkable enough. The\r\n_nativus_ who flies from the land on which he is born, let none retain\r\nhim or his chattels; if the lords will not send back these men to their\r\nland the king's officers are to do it[164]. On the other hand, the\r\ntillers of the soil are not to be worked beyond their proper rent; their\r\nlord may not remove them from their land so long as they perform their\r\nright services[165]. Whether or no we suppose that in the writer's\r\nopinion the ordinary peasant was a _nativus_ (of _nativi_ Domesday Book\r\nhas nothing to say) we still have law more favourable to the peasant\r\nthan was the common law of Bracton's age:--a tiller who does his\r\naccustomed service is not to be ejected; he is no tenant at will.\r\n\r\n[Rarity of flight.]\r\n\r\nHereafter we shall show that the English peasants did suffer by the\r\nsubstitution of French for English lords. But the question that we have\r\nasked, so urgent, so fundamental, as it may seem to us, is really one\r\nwhich, as the history of the Roman _coloni_ might prove, can long remain\r\nunanswered. Men may become economically so dependent on their lords, on\r\nwealthy masters and creditors, that the legal question whether they can\r\nquit their service has no interest. Who wishes to leave his all and go\r\nforth a beggar into the world? On the whole we can find no evidence\r\nwhatever that the men of the Confessor's day who were retrospectively\r\ncalled _villani_ were tied to the soil. Certainly in Norman times the\r\ntradition was held that according to the old law the _villanus_ might\r\nacquire five hides of land and so 'thrive to thegn-right[166].'\r\n\r\n[The villein and seignorial justice.]\r\n\r\nOur next question should be whether he was subject to seignorial\r\njustice. This is part of a much wider question that we must face\r\nhereafter, for seignorial justice should be treated as a whole. We must\r\nhere anticipate a conclusion, the proof of which will come by and by,\r\nnamely, that the _villanus_ sometimes was and sometimes was not the\r\njusticiable of a court in which his lord or his lord's steward presided.\r\nAll depended on the answer to the question whether his lord had 'sake\r\nand soke.' His lord might have justiciary rights over all his tenants,\r\nor merely over his _villani_, or he might have no justiciary rights, for\r\nas yet 'sake and soke' were in the king's gift, and the mere fact that a\r\nlord had 'men' or tenants did not give him a jurisdiction over them.\r\n\r\n[The villein and national justice.]\r\n\r\nWith this question is connected another, namely, whether the _villani_\r\nhad a _locus standi_ in the national courts. We have seen six _villani_\r\ntogether with the priest (undoubtedly a free man) and the reeve of each\r\nvill summoned to swear in the great inquest[167]. One of the most famous\r\nscenes recorded by our book is that in which William of Chernet claimed\r\na Hampshire manor on behalf of Hugh de Port and produced his witnesses\r\nfrom among the best and eldest men of the county; but Picot, the sheriff\r\nof Cambridgeshire, who was in possession, replied with the testimony of\r\nvilleins and mean folk and reeves, who were willing to support his case\r\nby oath or by ordeal[168]. Again, in Norfolk, Roger the sheriff claimed\r\na hundred acres and five _villani_ and a mill as belonging to the royal\r\nmanor of Branfort, and five _villani_ of the said manor testified in his\r\nfavour and offered to make whatever proof anyone might adjudge to them,\r\nbut the half-hundred of Ipswich testified that the land belonged to a\r\ncertain church of St. Peter that Wihtgar held, and he offered to\r\nderaign this[169]. Certainly this does not look as if _villani_ were\r\nexcluded from the national moots. But a rule which valued the oath of a\r\nsingle thegn as highly as the oath of six ceorls would make the ceorl\r\nbut a poor witness and tend to keep him out of court[170]. The men who\r\nare active in the communal courts, who make the judgments there, are\r\nusually men of thegnly rank; but to go to court as a doomsman is one\r\nthing, to go as a litigant is another[171].\r\n\r\n[The villein and his land.]\r\n\r\nWe may now approach the question whether, and if so in what sense, the\r\nland that the _villanus_ occupies is his land. Throughout Domesday Book\r\na distinction is sedulously maintained between the land of the villeins\r\n(_terra villanorum_) and the land that the lord has _in dominio_. Let us\r\nnotice this phrase. Only the demesne land does the lord hold _in\r\ndominio_, in ownership. The delicate shade of difference that Bracton\r\nwould see between _dominicum_ and _dominium_ is not as yet marked. In\r\nlater times it became strictly correct to say that the lord held in\r\ndemesne (_in dominico suo_) not only the lands which he occupied by\r\nhimself or his servants, but also the lands held of him by villein\r\ntenure[172]. This usage appears very plainly in the Dialogue on the\r\nExchequer. 'You shall know,' says the writer, 'that we give the name\r\ndemesnes (_dominica_) to those lands that a man cultivates at his own\r\ncost or by his own labour, and also to those which are possessed in his\r\nname by his _ascriptitii_; for by the law of this kingdom not only can\r\nthese _ascriptitii_ be removed by their lords from the lands that they\r\nnow possess and transferred to other places, but they may be sold and\r\ndispersed at will; so that rightly are both they and the lands which\r\nthey cultivate for the behalf of their lords accounted to be\r\n_dominia_[173].' Far other is the normal, if not invariable, usage of\r\nDomesday Book. The _terrae villanorum_, the _silvae villanorum_, the\r\n_piscariae villanorum_, the _molini villanorum_--for the villeins have\r\nwoods and fisheries and mills--these the lord does not hold _in\r\ndominio_[174]. Then again the oxen of the villeins are carefully\r\ndistinguished from the oxen of the demesne, while often enough they are\r\nnot distinguished from the oxen of those who in every sense are free\r\ntenants[175]. Now as regards both the land and the oxen we seem put to\r\nthe dilemma that either they belong to the lord or else they belong to\r\nthe villeins. We cannot avoid this dilemma, as we can in later days, by\r\nsaying that according to the common law the ownership of these things is\r\nwith the lord, while according to the custom of the manor it is with the\r\nvilleins, for we believe that a hall-moot, a manorial court, is still a\r\nsomewhat exceptional institution.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we can hardly doubt that both in their land and in their\r\noxen the villeins have had rights protected by law. Let us glance once\r\nmore at the scheme of _bót_ and _wer_ that has been in force. A villein\r\nis slain; the _manbót_ payable to his lord is marked off from the much\r\nheavier _wergild_ that is payable to his kindred. If all that a villein\r\ncould have belonged to his lord such a distinction would be idle.\r\n\r\n[The villein's land and the geld.]\r\n\r\nStill we take it that for one most important purpose the villein's land\r\nis the lord's land:--the lord must answer for the geld that is due from\r\nit. Not that the burden falls ultimately on the lord. On the contrary,\r\nit is not unlikely that he makes his villeins pay the geld that is due\r\nfrom his demesne land; it is one of their services that they must\r\n'defend their lord's inland' against the geld. But over against the\r\nstate the lord represents as well the land of his villeins as his own\r\ndemesne land. From the great levy of 1084 the demesne lands of the\r\nbarons had been exempted[176], but no doubt they had been responsible\r\nfor the tax assessed on the lands held by their _villani_. We much doubt\r\nwhether the collectors of the geld went round to the cottages of the\r\nvilleins and demanded here six pence and there four pence; they\r\npresented themselves at the lord's hall and asked for a large sum. Nay,\r\nwe believe that very often a perfectly free tenant paid his geld to his\r\nlord, or through his lord[177]. Hence arrangements by which some hides\r\nwere made to acquit other hides; such, for example, was the arrangement\r\nat Tewkesbury; there were fifty hides which had to acquit the whole\r\nninety-five hides from all geld and royal service[178]. And then it\r\nmight be that the lord, enjoying a special privilege, was entitled to\r\ntake the geld from his tenants and yet paid no geld to the king; thus\r\ndid the canons of St. Petroc in Cornwall[179] and the monks of St.\r\nEdmund in Suffolk[180]. But as regards lands occupied by villeins, the\r\nking, so it seems to us, looks for his geld to the lord and he does not\r\nlook behind the lord. This is no detail of a fiscal system. A potent\r\nforce has thus been set in motion. He who pays for land,--it is but fair\r\nthat he should be considered the owner of that land. We have a hint of\r\nthis principle in a law of Cnut:--'He who has \"defended\" land with the\r\nwitness of the shire, is to enjoy it without question during his life\r\nand on his death may give or sell it to whom he pleases[181].' We have\r\nanother hint of this principle in a story told by Heming, the monk of\r\nWorcester:--in Cnut's time but four days of grace were given to the\r\nlandowner for the payment of the geld; when these had elapsed, anyone\r\nwho paid the geld might have the land[182]. It is a principle which, if\r\nit is applied to the case of lord and villein, will attribute the\r\nownership of the land to the lord and not to the villein.\r\n\r\n[The villein's services.]\r\n\r\nAnd then we would ask: What services do the villeins render? A deep\r\nsilence answers us, and as will hereafter be shown, there are many\r\nreasons why we should not import the information given us by the\r\nmonastic cartularies, even such early cartularies as the Black Book of\r\nPeterborough, into the days of the Confessor. No doubt the villeins\r\nusually do some labour upon the lord's demesne lands. In particular they\r\nhelp to plough it. A manor, we can see, is generally so arranged that\r\nthe ratio borne by the demesne oxen to the demesne land will be smaller\r\nthan that borne by the villeins' oxen to the villeins' land. Thus, to\r\ngive one example out of a hundred, in a Somersetshire manor the lord has\r\nfour hides and three teams, the villeins have two hides and three\r\nteams[183]. But then the lord gets some help in his agriculture from\r\nthose who are undoubtedly free tenants. The teams of the free tenants\r\nare often covered by the same phrase that covers the teams of the\r\nvilleins[184]. Radknights who are _liberi homines_ plough and harrow at\r\nthe lord's court[185]. The very few entries which tell us of the labour\r\nof the villeins are quite insufficient to condemn the whole class to\r\nunlimited, or even to very heavy work. On a manor in Herefordshire there\r\nare twelve bordiers who work one day in the week[186]. On the enormous\r\nmanor of Leominster there are 238 _villani_ and 85 _bordarii_. The\r\n_villani_ plough and sow with their own seed 140 acres of their lord's\r\nland and they pay 11 pounds and 52 pence[187]. On the manor of Marcle,\r\nwhich also is in Herefordshire, there are 36 _villani_ and 10 _bordarii_\r\nwith 40 teams. These _villani_ plough and sow with their own seed 80\r\nacres of wheat and 71 of oats[188]. At Kingston, yet another manor in\r\nthe same county, 'the _villani_ who dwelt there in King Edward's day\r\ncarried venison to Hereford and did no other service, so says the\r\nshire[189].' On one Worcestershire manor of Westminster Abbey 10\r\nvilleins and 10 bordiers with 6 teams plough 6 acres and sow them with\r\ntheir own seed; on another 8 villeins and 6 bordiers with 6 teams do the\r\nlike by 4 acres[190]. This is light work. Casually we are told of\r\nburgesses living at Tamworth who have to work like the other villeins of\r\nthe manor of Drayton to which they are attached[191], and we are told of\r\nmen on a royal manor who do such works for the king as the reeve may\r\ncommand[192]; but, curiously enough, it is not of any villeins but of\r\nthe Bishop of Worcester's riding men (_radmanni_) that it is written\r\n'they do whatever is commanded them[193].'\r\n\r\n[Money rents paid by villeins.]\r\n\r\nWith our thirteenth century cartularies before us, we might easily\r\nunderrate the amount of money that was already being paid as the rent of\r\nland at the date of the Conquest. In several counties we come across\r\nsmall groups of _censarii_, _censores_, _gablatores_ who pay for their\r\nland in money, of _cervisarii_ and _mellitarii_ who bring beer and\r\nhoney. Renders in kind, in herrings, eels, salmon are not uncommon, and\r\nsometimes they are 'appreciated,' valued in terms of money. The pannage\r\npig or the grass swine, which the villeins give in return for mast and\r\nherbage, is often mentioned. Throughout Sussex it seems to be the custom\r\nthat the lord should have 'for herbage' one pig from every villein who\r\nhas seven pigs[194]. But money will be taken instead of swine, oxen or\r\nfish[195]. The _gersuma_, the _tailla_, the theoretically free gifts of\r\nthe tenants, are sums of money. But often enough the _villanus_ is\r\npaying a substantial money rent. We have seen how at Leominster villeins\r\nplough and sow 140 acres for their lord and pay a rent of more than\r\n£11[196]. At Lewisham in Kent the Abbot of Gand has a manor valued at\r\n£30; of this £2 is due to the profits of the port while two mills with\r\n'the gafol of the rustics' bring in £8. 12_s._[197] Such entries as the\r\nfollowing are not uncommon--there is one villein rendering\r\n30_d._[198]--there is one villein rendering 10_s._[199]--46 _cotarii_\r\nwith one hide render 30 shillings a year[200]--the villeins give 13_s._\r\n4_d._ by way of _consuetudo_[201]. No doubt it would be somewhat rare to\r\nfind a villein discharging all his dues in money--this is suggested when\r\nwe are told how on the land of St. Augustin one Wadard holds a large\r\npiece 'de terra villanorum' and yet renders no service to the abbot save\r\n30_s._ a year[202]. At least in one instance the villeins seem to be\r\nholding the manor in farm, that is to say, they are farming the demesne\r\nland and paying a rent in money or in provender[203]. We dare not\r\nrepresent the stream of economic history as flowing uninterruptedly from\r\na system of labour services to a system of rents. We must remember that\r\nin the Conqueror's reign the lord very often had numerous serfs whose\r\nwhole time was given to the cultivation of his demesne. In the\r\nsouth-western counties he will often have two, three or more serfs for\r\nevery team that he has on his demesne, and, while this is so, we can not\r\nsafely say that his husbandry requires that the villeins should be\r\nlabouring on his land for three or four days in every week.\r\n\r\n[The English for _villanus_.]\r\n\r\nAs a last question we may ask: What was the English for _villanus_? It\r\nis a foreign word, one of those words which came in with the Conqueror.\r\nSurely, we may argue, there must have been some English equivalent for\r\nit. Yet we have the greatest difficulty in finding the proper term. True\r\nthat in the Quadripartitus and the Leges _villanus_ generally represents\r\n_ceorl_; _ceorl_ when it is not rendered by _villanus_ is left\r\nuntranslated in some such form as _cyrliscus homo_. But then _ceorl_\r\nmust be a wider word than the _villanus_ of Domesday Book, for it has\r\nto cover all the non-noble free men; it must comprehend the numerous\r\n_sochemanni_ and _liberi homines_ of northern and eastern England. This\r\nin itself is not a little remarkable; it makes us suspect that some of\r\nthe lines drawn by Domesday Book are by no means very old; they can not\r\nbe drawn by any of those terms that have been current in the Anglo-Saxon\r\ndooms or which still are current in the text-books that lawyers are\r\ncompiling. To suppose that _villanus_ is equivalent to _gebúr_ is\r\nimpossible; we have the best warrant for saying that the Latin for\r\n_gebúr_ is not _villanus_ but _colibertus_[204]. Nor can we hold that\r\nthe _villanus_ is a _geneat_. In the last days of the old English\r\nkingdom the _geneat_, the 'companion,' the 'fellow,' appears as a\r\nhorseman who rides on his lord's errands; we must seek him among the\r\n_radmanni_ and _rachenistres_ and _drengi_ of Domesday Book[205]. We\r\nshall venture the guess that when the Norman clerks wrote down\r\n_villanus_, the English jurors had said _túnesman_. As a matter of\r\netymology the two words answer to each other well enough; the _villa_ is\r\nthe _tún_, and the men of the _villa_ are the men of the _tún_. In the\r\nenlarged Latin version of the laws of Cnut, known as Instituta Cnuti,\r\nthere is an important remark:--tithes are to be paid both from the lands\r\nof the thegn and from the lands of the villeins--'tam de dominio\r\nliberalis hominis, id est þegenes, quam de terra villanorum, id est\r\ntuumannes (_corr._ tunmannes)[206].' Then in a collection of dooms known\r\nas the Northumbrian Priests' Law there is a clause which orders the\r\npayment of Peter's pence. If a king's thegn or landlord (_landrica_)\r\nwithholds his penny, he must pay ten half-marks, half to Christ, half to\r\nthe king; but if a _túnesman_ withholds it, then let the landlord pay it\r\nand take an ox from the man[207]. A very valuable passage this is. It\r\nshows us how the lord is becoming responsible for the man's taxes: if\r\nthe tenant will not pay them, the lord must. It is then in connexion\r\nwith this responsibility of the lord that the term _townsman_ meets us,\r\nand, if we mistake not, it is the lord's responsibility for geld that is\r\nthe chief agent in the definition of the class of _villani_. The\r\npressure of taxation, civil and ecclesiastical, has been forming new\r\nsocial strata, and a new word, in itself a vague word, is making its way\r\ninto the vocabulary of the law[208].\r\n\r\n[Summary.]\r\n\r\nThe class of villeins may well be heterogeneous. It may well contain (so\r\nwe think) men who, or whose ancestors, have owned the land under a\r\npolitical supremacy, not easily to be distinguished from landlordship,\r\nthat belongs to the king; and, on the other hand, it may well contain\r\nthose who have never in themselves or their predecessors been other than\r\nthe tenants of another man's soil. In some counties on the Welsh march\r\nthere are groups of _hospites_ who in fact or theory are colonists whom\r\nthe lord has invited onto his land[209]; but this word, very common in\r\nFrance, is not common in England. Our record is not concerned to\r\ndescribe the nature or the origin of the villein's tenure; it is in\r\nquest of geld and of the persons who ought to be charged with geld, and\r\nso it matters not whether the lord has let land to the villein or has\r\nacquired rights over land of which the villein was once the owner.\r\nTherefore we lay down no broad principle about the rights of the\r\nvillein, but we have suggested that taken in the mass the _villani_ of\r\nthe Confessor's reign were far more 'law-worthy' than were the _villani_\r\nof the thirteenth century. We can not treat either the legal or the\r\neconomic history of our peasantry as a continuous whole; it is divided\r\ninto two parts by the red thread of the Norman Conquest. That is a\r\ncatastrophe. William might do his best to make it as little of a\r\ncatastrophe as was possible, to insist that each French lord should have\r\nprecisely the same rights that had been enjoyed by his English\r\n_antecessor_; it may even be that he endeavoured to assure to those who\r\nwere becoming _villani_ the rights that they had enjoyed under King\r\nEdward[210]. Such a task, if attempted, was impossible. We hear indeed\r\nthat the English 'redeemed their lands,' but probably this refers only\r\nto those English lords, those thegns or the like, who were fortunate\r\nenough to find that a ransom would be accepted[211]. We have no warrant\r\nfor thinking that the peasants, the common 'townsmen,' obtained from\r\nthe king any covenanted mercies. They were handed over to new lords, who\r\nwere very free in fact, if not in theory, to get out of them all that\r\ncould be got without gross cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Depression of the villeins.]\r\n\r\nWe are not left to speculate about this matter. In after days those who\r\nwere likely to hold a true tradition, the great financier of the\r\ntwelfth, the great lawyer of the thirteenth century, believed that there\r\nhad been a catastrophe. As a result of the Conquest, the peasants, at\r\nall events some of the peasants, had fallen from their free estate; free\r\nmen, holding freely, they had been compelled to do unfree services[212].\r\nBut if we need not rely upon speculation, neither need we rely upon\r\ntradition. Domesday Book is full of evidence that the tillers of the\r\nsoil are being depressed.\r\n\r\n[The Normans and the peasants.]\r\n\r\nHere we may read of a free man with half a hide who has now been made\r\none of the villeins[213], there of the holder of a small manor who now\r\ncultivates it as the farmer of a French lord _graviter et\r\nmiserabiliter_[214], and there of a sokeman who has lost his land for\r\nnot paying geld, though none was due[215]; while the great Richard of\r\nTonbridge has condescended to abstract a virgate from a villein or a\r\nvillein from a virgate[216]. But, again, it is not on a few cases in\r\nwhich our record states that some man has suffered an injustice that we\r\nwould rely. Rather we notice what it treats as a quite common event.\r\nFree men are being 'added to' manors to which they did not belong. Thus\r\nin Suffolk a number of free men have been added to the manor of\r\nMontfort; they pay no 'custom' to it before the Conquest, but now they\r\npay £15; Ælfric who was reeve under Roger Bigot set them this\r\ncustom[217]. Hard by them were men who used to pay 20 shillings, but\r\nthis same Ælfric raised their rent to 100 shillings[218]. 'A free man\r\nheld this land and could sell it, but Waleran father of John has added\r\nhim to this manor[219]':--Entries of this kind are common. The utmost\r\nrents are being exacted from the farmers:--this manor was let for three\r\nyears at a rent of £12 and a yearly gift of an ounce of gold, but all\r\nthe farmers who took it were ruined[220]--that manor was let for £3.\r\n15_s_. but the men were thereby ruined and now it is valued at only\r\n45_s._[221] About these matters French and English can not agree:--this\r\nmanor renders £70 by weight, but the English value it at only £60 by\r\ntale[222]--the English fix the value at £80, but the French at\r\n£100[223]--Frenchmen and Englishmen agree that it is worth £50, but\r\nRichard let it to an Englishman for £60, who thereby lost £10 a year, at\r\nthe very least[224]. 'It can not pay,' 'it can hardly pay,' 'it could\r\nnot stand' the rent, such are the phrases that we hear. If the lord gets\r\nthe most out of the farmer to whom he has leased the manor, we may be\r\nsure that the farmer is making the most out of the villeins.\r\n\r\n[Depression of the sokemen.]\r\n\r\nBut the most convincing proof of the depression of the peasantry comes\r\nto us from Cambridgeshire. The rural population of that county as it\r\nexisted in 1086 has been classified thus[225]:--\r\n\r\n                    sochemanni   213\r\n                    villani     1902\r\n                    bordarii    1428\r\n                    cotarii      736\r\n                    servi        548\r\n\r\nBut we also learn that the Cambridgeshire of the Confessor's day had\r\ncontained at the very least 900 instead of 200 sokemen[226]. This is an\r\nenormous and a significant change. Let us look at a single village. In\r\nMeldreth there is a manor; it is now a manor of the most ordinary kind;\r\nit is rated at 3 hides and 1 virgate, but contains 5 team-lands; in\r\ndemesne are half a hide and one team, and 15 _bordarii_ and 3 _cotarii_\r\nhave 4 teams, and there is one _servus_. But before the Conquest this\r\nland was held by 15 sokemen; 10 of them were under the soke of the Abbey\r\nof Ely and held 2 hides and half a virgate; the other 5 held 1 hide and\r\nhalf a virgate and were the men of Earl Ælfgar[227]. What has become of\r\nthese fifteen sokemen? They are now represented by fifteen bordiers and\r\nfive cottiers; and the demesne land of the manor is a new thing. The\r\nsokemen have fallen, and their fall has brought with it the\r\nconsolidation of manorial husbandry and seignorial power. At Orwell Earl\r\nRoger has now a small estate; a third of it is in demesne, while the\r\nresidue is held by 2 villeins and 3 bordiers, and there is a serf there.\r\nThis land had belonged to six sokemen, and those six had been under no\r\nless than five different lords; two belonged to Edith the Fair, one to\r\nArchbishop Stigand, one to Robert Wimarc's son, one to the king, and one\r\nto Earl Ælfgar[228]. Displacements such as this we may see in village\r\nafter village. No one can read the survey of Cambridgeshire without\r\nseeing that the freer sorts of the peasantry have been thrust out, or\r\nrather thrust down.\r\n\r\n[Further illustrations of depression.]\r\n\r\nEvidence so cogent as this we shall hardly find in any part of the\r\nrecord save that which relates to Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. But\r\ngreat movements of the kind that we are examining will hardly confine\r\nthemselves within the boundaries of a county. A little variation in the\r\nformula which tells us who held the land in 1066 may hide from us the\r\ntrue state of the case. We can not expect that men will be very accurate\r\nin stating the legal relationships that existed twenty years ago. Since\r\nthe day when King Edward was alive and dead many things have happened,\r\nmany new words and new forms of thought have become familiar. But taking\r\nthe verdicts as we find them, there is still no lack of evidence. In\r\nEssex we may see the _liberi homines_ disappearing[229]. But we need not\r\nlook only to the eastern counties. At Bromley, in Surrey, Bishop Odo has\r\na manor of 32 hides, 4 of which had belonged to 'free men' who could go\r\nwhere they pleased, but now there are only villeins, cottiers, and\r\nserfs[230]. We turn the page and find Odo holding 10 hides which had\r\nbelonged to 'the alodiaries of the vill[231].' In Kent Hugh de Port is\r\nholding land that was held by 6 free men who could go whither they\r\nwould; there are now 6 villeins and 14 bordiers there, with one team\r\nbetween them[232]. Students of Domesday were too apt to treat the\r\n_antecessores_ of the Norman lords as being in all cases lords of\r\nmanors. Lords of manors, or rather holders of manors, they often were,\r\nbut as we shall see more fully hereafter, when we are examining the term\r\n_manerium_, such phrases are likely to deceive us. Often enough they\r\nwere very small people with very little land. For example these six free\r\nmen whom Hugh de Port represents had only two and a half team-lands. We\r\npass by a few pages and find Hugh de Montfort with a holding which\r\ncomprises but one team-land and a half; he has 4 villeins and 2 bordiers\r\nthere. His _antecessores_ were three free men, who could go whither they\r\nwould[233]. They had need for but 12 oxen; they had no more land than\r\nthey could easily till, at all events with the help of two or three\r\ncottagers or slaves. To all appearance they were no better than\r\npeasants. They or their sons may still be tilling the land as Hugh's\r\nvilleins. When we look for such instances we very easily find them. The\r\ncase is not altered by the fact that the term 'manor' is given to the\r\nholdings of these _antecessores_. In Sussex an under-tenant of Earl\r\nRoger has an estate with four villeins upon it. His _antecessores_ were\r\ntwo free men who held the land as two manors. And how much land was\r\nthere to be divided between the two? There was one team-land. Such\r\nholders of _maneria_ were tillers of the soil, peasants, at best\r\nyeomen[234]. If they were of thegnly rank, this again does not alter the\r\ncase. When in the survey of Dorset we read how four thegns held two\r\nteam-lands, how six thegns held two team-lands, eight thegns two\r\nteam-lands, nine thegns four team-lands, eleven thegns four\r\nteam-lands[235], we can not of course be certain that each of these\r\ngroups of co-tenants had but one holding; but thegnly rank is inherited,\r\nand if a thegn will have nine or ten sons there will soon be tillers of\r\nthe soil with the wergild of twelve hundred shillings. Now if these\r\nthings are being done in the middling strata of society, if the sokemen\r\nare being suppressed or depressed in Cambridgeshire, the alodiaries in\r\nSussex, what is likely to be the fate of the poor? They will have to\r\ntill their lord's demesne _graviter et miserabiliter_. He can afford to\r\ndispense with serfs, for he has villeins.\r\n\r\n[The peasants on the royal demesne.]\r\n\r\nA last argument must be added. What we see in the thirteenth century of\r\nthe ancient demesne of the crown[236] might lead us to expect that in\r\nDomesday Book 'the manors of St. Edward' would stand out in bold\r\nrelief. Instead of a population mainly consisting of villeins shall we\r\nnot find upon them large numbers of sokemen, the ancestors of the men\r\nwho in after days will be protected by the little writ of right and the\r\n_Monstraverunt_? Nothing of the kind. The royal manor differs in no such\r\nmode as this from any other manor. If it lies in a county in which other\r\nmanors have sokemen, then it may or may not have sokemen. If it lies in\r\na county in which other manors have no sokemen, it will have none.\r\nCambridgeshire is a county in which there are some, and have been many,\r\nsokemen; there is hardly a sokeman upon the ancient demesne. In after\r\ndays the men of Chesterton, for example, will have all the peculiar\r\nrights attributed by lawyers to the sokemen of St. Edward. But St.\r\nEdward, if we trust Domesday Book, had never a sokeman there; he had two\r\nvilleins and a number of bordiers and cottiers[237]. It seems fairly\r\nclear that from an early time, if not from the first days of the\r\nConquest onwards, the king was the best of landlords. The tenants of\r\nthose manors that were conceived as annexed to the crown, those tenants\r\none and all, save the class of slaves which was disappearing, got a\r\nbetter, a more regular justice than that which the villeins of other\r\nlords could hope for. It was the king's justice, and therefore--for\r\nthe king's public and private capacities were hardly to be distinguished\r\n--it was public justice, and so became formal justice, defined by writs,\r\nadministered in the last resort by the highest court, the ablest\r\nlawyers. And so sokemen disappear from private manors. Some of them as\r\ntenants in free socage may maintain their position; many fall down into\r\nthe class of tenants in villeinage. On the ancient demesne the sokemen\r\nmultiply; they appear where Domesday knew them not; for those who are\r\nprotected by royal justice can hardly (now that villeinage implies a\r\nprecarious tenure) be called villeins, they must be 'villein sokemen' at\r\nthe least. Whether or no we trust the tradition which ascribes to the\r\nConqueror a law in favour of the tillers of the soil, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that the _villani_ and _bordarii_ whom Domesday Book shows us on\r\nthe royal manors are treated as having legal rights in their holdings.\r\nAnd if this be true of them, it should be true of their peers upon other\r\nmanors. Yes, it should be true; the manorial courts that are arising\r\nshould do impartial justice even between lord and villeins; but who is\r\nto make it true?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [101] D.

B. i. 179 b, Heref.: 'Villani dant de\r\n        consuetudine 13 sol. et 4 den. et [sex] coliberti reddunt 3\r\n        sextarios frumenti et ordei et 2 oves et dimidiam cum agnis et\r\n        2 den. et unum obolum.' D. B. i. 165: 'et in Glouucestre 1\r\n        burgensis reddens 5 den. et 2 coliberti reddentes 34 den.' In\r\n        a charter coming from Bishop Denewulf (K. 1079) we read of\r\n        three wite-theówmen who were boor-born and three who were\r\n        theów-born.\r\n\r\n  [110] Ellis, Introduction, ii. 511-14.\r\n\r\n  [111] For examples see D. B. iv. 211 and the following pages.\r\n\r\n  [112] Leg. Hen. 81, § 3: 'Quidam villani qui sunt eiusmodi\r\n        leierwitam et blodwitam et huiusmodi minora forisfacta emerunt\r\n        a dominis suis, vel quomodo meruerunt de suis et in suos,\r\n        quorum fletgefoth vel overseunessa est 30 den.; cothseti 15\r\n        den.; servi 6 den.'\r\n\r\n  [113] D. B. i. 71, Haseberie: '5 villani et 13 coscez et 2 cotarii.'\r\n        Ibid. 80 b: Chinestanestone: '18 villani et 14 coscez et 4\r\n        cotarii.'\r\n\r\n  [114] Worcester Register, 59 b (Sedgebarrow): four _cotmanni_, each\r\n        of whom pays 20_d._ or works one day a week and two in autumn;\r\n        two _cottarii_, each of whom pays 12_d._ or works one day a\r\n        week. Ibid. 69 b (Shipston): two _cotmanni_, each of whom pays\r\n        3_s._ or works like a virgater; two _cottarii_, each of whom\r\n        pays 13_d._ Ibid. 76 a (Cropthorn): two _cotmanni_, each of\r\n        whom pays 2_s._ or works like a _cottarius_; two _cottarii_,\r\n        each of whom pays 18_d._ or works one day a week.\r\n\r\n  [115] Vinogradoff, Villainage, 149, gives a few instances of its\r\n        occurrence; but it seems to be very rare.\r\n\r\n  [116] D. B. i. 127 b, Fuleham: 'Ibi 5 villani quisque 1 hidam.'\r\n        There are a good many other instances.\r\n\r\n  [117] D. B. i. 130, Hamntone; 'et 4 bordarii quisque de dimidia\r\n        virga.'\r\n\r\n  [118] D. B. i. 127, Herges: 'et 2 cotarii de 13 acris.'\r\n\r\n  [119] D. B. i. 127 b, Fuleham: 'et 22 cotarii de dimidia hida et 8\r\n        cotarii de suis hortis.'\r\n\r\n  [120] D. B. ii. 75 b: 'et 5 bordarii super aquam qui non tenent\r\n        terram.'\r\n\r\n  [121] D. B. i. 163 b, Turneberie: 'et 42 villani et 18 radchenistre\r\n        cum 21 carucis et 23 bordarii et 15 servi et 4 coliberti.'\r\n        Ibid. 164, Hechanestede: 'et 5 villani et 8 bordarii cum 6\r\n        carucis; ibi 6 servi.'\r\n\r\n  [122] D. B. iv. 215-223; on p. 223 there are two _villani_ with one\r\n        ox.\r\n\r\n  [123] D. B. i. 164, Tedeneham: 'Ibi erant 38 villani habentes 38\r\n        carucas.' Ibid. 164 b, Nortune, '15 villani cum 15 carucis;\r\n        Stanwelle, 5 villani cum 5 carucis.'\r\n\r\n  [124] Malden, Domesday Survey of Surrey (Domesday Studies, ii.) 469,\r\n        says that in Surrey '_bordarii_ and _cotarii_ only occur once\r\n        together upon the same manor, and very seldom in the same\r\n        hundred.... There are three hundreds, Godalming, Wallington\r\n        and Elmbridge, where the _cotarii_ are nearly universal to the\r\n        exclusion of _bordarii_. In the others the _bordarii_ are\r\n        nearly or quite universal, to the exclusion of the _cotarii_.'\r\n\r\n  [125] Thorpe, Diplomatarium, 623. King Eadwig declares that a\r\n        certain church-ward of Exeter is 'free and fare-worthy.'\r\n\r\n  [126] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 341 ff.\r\n\r\n  [127] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 354-8.\r\n\r\n  [128] Liebermann, Instituta Cnuti, Transact. Roy. Hist. Soc. vii.\r\n        93.\r\n\r\n  [129] Leg. Will. Conq. I. 8: 'La were del thein 20 lib. in\r\n        Merchenelahe, 25 lib. in Westsexenelahe. La were del vilain\r\n        100 sol. en Merchenelahe e ensement en Westsexene.' Leg. Henr.\r\n        70, § 1: 'In Westsexa quae caput regni est et legum, twyhindi,\r\n        i.e. villani, wera est 4 lib.; twelfhindi, i.e. thaini, 25\r\n        lib.' Ibid. 76, § 2: 'Omnis autem wera liberorum est aut\r\n        servorum ... liberi alii twyhindi, alii syxhindi, alii\r\n        twelfhindi'; § 6, twihindus = cyrliscus = villanus. As to the\r\n        100 shillings in the first of these passages, see Schmid, p.\r\n        676. There is some other evidence that the equation, 1 Norman\r\n        shilling = 2 English shillings, was occasionally treated as\r\n        correct enough. As to the six-hynde man, see Schmid, p. 653;\r\n        we may doubt whether he existed in the eleventh century, but\r\n        according to the Instituta Cnuti the _radchenistres_ of the\r\n        west may have been six-hynde. We must not draw from Alfred's\r\n        treaty with the Danes (Schmid, p. 107) the inference that the\r\n        normal ceorl was seated on _gafol-land_. This international\r\n        instrument is settling an exceptionally high tariff for the\r\n        maintenance of the peace. Every man, whatever his rank, is to\r\n        enjoy the handsome wergild of 8 half-marks of pure gold,\r\n        except the Danish lysing and the English ceorl who is seated\r\n        on gafol-land; these are to have but the common wer of 200\r\n        shillings. The parallel passage in Æthelred's treaty (Schmid,\r\n        p. 207) sets £30 on every free man if he is killed by a man of\r\n        the other race. See Schmid, p. 676.\r\n\r\n  [130] Ine, 55: a sheep with a lamb until a fortnight after Easter is\r\n        worth 1 shilling. Æthelstan, VI. 6: a horse 120 pence, an ox\r\n        30 pence, a cow 20, a sheep 1 shilling (5 pence). Ibid. 8, §\r\n        5: an ox 30 pence. Schmid, App. I. c. 7: a horse 30 shillings,\r\n        a mare 20 shillings, an ox 30 pence, a cow 24 pence, a swine 8\r\n        pence, a sheep 1 shilling, a goat 2 pence, a man (i.e. a\r\n        slave) 1 pound. Schmid, App. iii. c. 9: a sheep or 3 pence. D.\r\n        B. i. 117 b: an ox or 30 pence. D. B. i. 26: Tolls at Lewes;\r\n        for a man 4 pence, an ox a halfpenny. This preserves the\r\n        equation that we have already seen, namely, 1 slave = 8 oxen.\r\n        Thus the full team is worth one pound. On the twelfth century\r\n        Pipe Rolls the ox often costs 3 shillings (= 36 pence) or even\r\n        more.\r\n\r\n  [131] In Leg. Will. Conq. I. 16, we hear of the _forisfacturae_\r\n        (probably the 'insult fines') due to archbishops, bishops,\r\n        counts, barons and sokemen; the baron has 10 shillings, the\r\n        sokeman 40 pence. In the same document, c. 20, § 2, we read of\r\n        the reliefs of counts, barons, vavassors and villeins. Leg.\r\n        Edw. Conf. 12, § 4, speaks of the _manbót_ due in the Danelaw;\r\n        on the death of a _villanus_ or a _socheman_ 12 ores are paid,\r\n        on the death of a _liber homo_ 3 marks.\r\n\r\n  [132] D. B. i. 167 b, Heile: 'ibi erant 12 servi quos Willelmus\r\n        liberos fecit.'\r\n\r\n  [133] D. B. i. 263: 'Si quis liber homo facit opera in die feriato\r\n        inde episcopus habet 8 solidos. De servo autem vel ancilla\r\n        feriatum diem infringente, habet episcopus 4 solidos.' Compare\r\n        Cnut, II. 45.\r\n\r\n  [134] D. B. i. 86: 'Huic manerio reddebatur T. R. E. de Cruche per\r\n        annum consuetudo, hoc est 6 oves cum agnis totidem, et quisque\r\n        liber homo i. blomam ferri.' South Perrott had belonged to the\r\n        Confessor, Crewkerne to Edith, probably 'the rich and fair.'\r\n        For the description of Cruche see D. B. i. 86 b. As to the\r\n        'bloom' of iron see Ellis, Introduction, i. 136.\r\n\r\n  [135] D. B. i. 92. See also p. 87 b, the account of Seveberge.\r\n\r\n  [136] D. B. ii. 145.\r\n\r\n  [137] D. B. ii. 1: 'In hoc manerio erat tunc temporis quidam liber\r\n        homo de dimidia hida qui modo effectus est unus de villanis.'\r\n\r\n  [138] Thus D. B. i. 127, Mid.: 'inter francos et villanos 45\r\n        carucae'; Ibid. 70, Wilts: '4 villani et 3 bordarii et unus\r\n        francus cum 2 carucis'; Ibid. 241, Warw.: 'Ibi sunt 3\r\n        francones homines cum 4 villanis et 3 bordariis.' Sometimes\r\n        _francus_ may be an equivalent for _francigena_; e.g. i. 254\r\n        b, where in one entry we have _unus francigena_ and in the\r\n        next _unus francus homo_. But an Englishman may be _francus_;\r\n        ii. 54 b 'accepit 15 acras de uno franco teigno et misit cum\r\n        terra sua.' However, it is not an insignificant fact that the\r\n        very name of Frenchman (_francigena_) must have suggested free\r\n        birth.\r\n\r\n  [139] For examples see the surveys of Warwick, Stafford and\r\n        Shropshire.\r\n\r\n  [140] D. B. ii. 260: 'et 7 homines qui possent vendere terram suam\r\n        si eam prius obtulissent domino suo.'\r\n\r\n  [141] D. B. ii. 278 b: 'si vellent recedere daret quisque 2\r\n        solidos.' Ibid. 207: 'et possent recedere si darent 2\r\n        solidos.'\r\n\r\n  [142] D. B. ii. 435: 'Et super Vlnoht habuit commendationem\r\n        antecessor R. Malet, teste hundredo, et non potuit vendere nec\r\n        dare _de eo_ terram suam.' Ibid. 397: 'viderunt eum iurare\r\n        quod non poterat dare [vel] vendere terram suam _ab_\r\n        antecessore Ricardi.'\r\n\r\n  [143] D. B. i. 145: 'Hoc manerium tenuit Aluuinus homo Estan, non\r\n        potuit dare nec vendere extra Brichelle manerium Estani.'\r\n\r\n  [144] D. B. i. 133: 'Hanc terram tenuit Aluric Blac 2 hidas de\r\n        Abbate Westmonasterii T. R. E.: non poterat separare ab\r\n        aecclesia.'\r\n\r\n  [145] D. B. ii. 216 b: 'Ita est in monasterio quod nec vendere nec\r\n        forisfacere potest extra ecclesia.'\r\n\r\n  [146] For example, D. B. i. 201: 'terram suam vendere potuerunt,\r\n        soca vero remansit Abbati.' D. B. ii. 78: 'et poterant vendere\r\n        terram set soca et saca remanebat antecessori Alberici.' Ibid.\r\n        ii. 92 b: 'unus sochemannus fuit in hac terra de 15 acris quas\r\n        poterat vendere, set soca iacebat in Warleia terra S. Pauli.'\r\n\r\n  [147] But the _consuetudo_, rent or the like, may 'remain': D. B.\r\n        ii. 181 b: 'et possent vendere terram suam set consuetudo\r\n        remanebat in manerio.' And so the _commendatio_ may 'remain';\r\n        ii. 357 b: 'Hi poterant dare et vendere terram, set saca et\r\n        soca et commendatio remanebant Sancto [Eadmundo].'\r\n\r\n  [148] For example, D. B. i. 201: 'Homines Abbatis de Ely fuerunt et\r\n        4 terram suam _vendere potuerunt_, soca vero remansit Abbati,\r\n        et quartus 1 virgam et dimidiam habuit et _recedere non\r\n        potuit_.' See the important evidence produced by Round, Feudal\r\n        England, 24, as to the equivalence of these phrases.\r\n\r\n  [149] One of the commonest terms is _recedere_--'potuit\r\n        recedere'--'non potuit recedere'; i. 41, 'non potuit cum terra\r\n        _recedere ad alium dominum_'; i. 56 b, '10 liberi homines T.\r\n        R. E. tenebant 12 hidas et dimidiam de terra eiusdem manerii\r\n        sed _inde recedere_ non poterant'; ii. 19 b, 'non poterant\r\n        _recedere a terra_ sine licentia Abbatis'; ii. 57 b, 'non\r\n        poterant recedere _ab illo manerio_'; ii. 66, 'non poterant\r\n        _removere_ ab illo manerio'; ii. 41, 'non poterant _recedere a\r\n        soca_ Wisgari'; ii. 41 b, 'nec poterant _abire_ sine iussu\r\n        domini'; i. 66 b, 'qui tenuit T. R. E. non poterat ab\r\n        aecclesia diverti [separari]'; ii. 116, 'unus [burgensis] erat\r\n        ita dominicus ut non posset _recedere nec homagium facere_\r\n        sine licentia [Stigandi]'; ii. 119, 'de istis hominibus erant\r\n        36 ita dominice Regis Edwardi ut non possent _esse homines\r\n        cuiuslibet_ sed semper tamen consuetudo regis remanebat preter\r\n        herigete.' A remarkable form is, ii. 57 b, 'non potuit istam\r\n        terram mittere in aliquo loco nisi in abbatia.' Then 'potuit\r\n        ire quo voluit,' 'non potuit ire quolibet' are common enough.\r\n\r\n  [150] Ine, c. 39: He who leaves his lord without permission pays\r\n        sixty shillings to his lord.\r\n\r\n  [151] For example, D. B. i. 41: 'Tres taini tenuerunt de episcopo et\r\n        non potuerunt ire quolibet.'\r\n\r\n  [152] D. B. i. 35 b, Tornecrosta.\r\n\r\n  [153] D. B. i. 212 b, Stanford.\r\n\r\n  [154] D. B. i. 249 b: 'Tres taini tenuerunt et liberi homines\r\n        fuerunt'; 256, 'Ipsi taini liberi erant'; 259 b, 'Quatuor\r\n        taini tenuerunt ante eum et liberi fuerunt.'\r\n\r\n  [155] Chron. Abingd. i. 490: 'Nam quidam dives, Turkillus nomine,\r\n        sub Haroldi comitis testimonio et consultu, de se cum sua\r\n        terra quae Kingestun dicitur, ecclesiae Abbendonensi et abbati\r\n        Ordrico homagium fecit; licitum quippe libero cuique, illo in\r\n        tempore, sic agere erat.'\r\n\r\n  [156] D.

'Haec terra libera fuit et\r\n        quieta ab omni geldo et regali servitio'; 170, 'Una hida et\r\n        dimidia libera a geldo.' When after reading these passages we\r\n        come upon the following (167 b), 'Isdem W. tenet Tatinton:\r\n        Ulgar tenuit de rege Edwardo: haec terra libera est,' and when\r\n        we observe that the land is not hidated, we shall probably\r\n        infer that 'This land is free' means 'This land is exempt from\r\n        geld, and (perhaps) from all other royal service.'\r\n\r\n  [162] Dialogus, i. c. 11; ii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n  [163] Dialogus, i. c. 10.\r\n\r\n  [164] Will. Conq. I. 30, 31: 'Si les seignurages ne facent altri\r\n        gainurs venir a lour terre, la justise le facet.' The Latin\r\n        version is ridiculous: 'Si domini terrarum non procurent\r\n        _idoneos_ cultores ad terras suas colendas, iustitiarii hoc\r\n        faciant.' The translator seems to have been puzzled by the\r\n        word _altri_ or _autrui_.\r\n\r\n  [165] Ibid. 29.\r\n\r\n  [166] Schmid, App. v.; vii., 2, §§ 9-11; Pseudoleges Canuti, 60-1\r\n        (Schmid, p. 431).\r\n\r\n  [167] D. B. iv. 497.\r\n\r\n  [168] D. B. i. 44 b: 'Istam terram calumpniatur Willelmus de\r\n        Chernet, dicens pertinere ad manerium de Cerneford feudum\r\n        Hugonis de Port per hereditatem sui antecessoris et de hoc\r\n        suum testimonium adduxit de melioribus et antiquis hominibus\r\n        totius comitatus et hundredi; et Picot contraduxit suum\r\n        testimonium de villanis et vili plebe et de prepositis, qui\r\n        volunt defendere per sacramentum vel dei iudicium, quod ille\r\n        qui tenuit terram liber homo fuit et potuit ire cum terra sua\r\n        quo voluit. Sed testes Willelmi nolunt accipere legem nisi\r\n        regis Edwardi usque dum diffiniatur per regem.' It seems\r\n        possible that William's witnesses wished to insist on the\r\n        ancient rule that the oath of one thegn would countervail the\r\n        oaths of six ceorls. This was the old English law (_lex\r\n        Edwardi_) on which they relied.\r\n\r\n  [169] D.

B. iv. 75 we have\r\n        _dominicatus Regis_, for the king's demesne. There is already\r\n        a slight ambiguity about the term _dominium_. We may say that\r\n        a church has a manor _in dominio_, meaning thereby that the\r\n        manor as a whole is held by the church itself and is not held\r\n        of it by any tenant; and then we may go on to say that only\r\n        one half of the land comprised in this manor is held by the\r\n        church _in dominio_. Cf. Hist. Eng. Law, ii. 126.\r\n\r\n  [175] For example, D. B. i. 159: 'Nunc in dominio 3 carucae et 6\r\n        servi, et 26 villani cum 3 bordariis et 15 liberi homines\r\n        habent 30 carucas.'

They will be villeins, bordiers,\r\ncottiers, 'boors' or serfs. Here and there we may find a few persons who\r\nare described as _liberi homines_. In some of the western counties,\r\nGloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Shropshire, there are _rachenistres_ or\r\n_radmans_; between the Ribble and the Mersey we may find a party of\r\n_drengs_. Still it is generally true that two of those five classes that\r\nseem to have been mentioned in King William's writ[239], the\r\n_sochemanni_ and the _liberi homines_, are largely represented only in\r\ncertain counties. They are to be seen in Essex, yet more thickly in\r\nSuffolk and Norfolk. In Lincolnshire nearly half of the rural population\r\nconsists of sokemen, though there is no class of persons described as\r\n_liberi homines_. There are some sokemen in Yorkshire, but they are not\r\nvery numerous and there are hardly any _liberi homines_. We have seen\r\nhow in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire the sokemen have fared ill; but\r\nstill some are left there. Traces of them may be found in Hertford and\r\nBuckingham; they are thick in Leicester, Nottingham and Northampton;\r\nthere are some in Derbyshire. There have been sokemen in Middlesex[240]\r\nand in Surrey[241]; but they have been suppressed; a few remain in\r\nKent[242]; so we should be rash were we to find anything\r\ncharacteristically Scandinavian in the sokemen. Even in Suffolk they are\r\nsuffering ill at the hands of their new masters[243], while in\r\nCambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire they have been suppressed or\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\n[Lord and man.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to enter on a difficult task, a discussion of the relation\r\nwhich exists between these _sochemanni_ and _liberi homines_ on the one\r\nhand and their lord upon the other. The character of this relation\r\nvaries from case to case. We may distinguish three different bonds by\r\nwhich a man may be bound to a lord, a personal bond, a tenurial bond, a\r\njurisdictional or justiciary bond. But the language of Domesday Book is\r\nnot very patient of this analysis. However in the second volume we very\r\nfrequently come upon two ideas which are sharply contrasted with each\r\nother; the one is expressed by the term _commendatio_, the other by the\r\nterm _soca_[244]. To these we must add the great vague term\r\n_consuetudo_, and we shall also have to consider the phrases which\r\ndescribe the various degrees of that freedom of 'withdrawing himself\r\nwith his land' that a man may enjoy.\r\n\r\n[Bonds between lord and man.]\r\n\r\nIn order that we may become familiar with the use made of these terms\r\nand phrases we will transcribe a few typical entries:\r\n\r\n     Two free men, of whom Ælfwin had not even the commendation[245].\r\n\r\n     Of these men Harold had not even the commendation[246].\r\n\r\nThus commendation seems put before us as the slightest bond that there\r\ncan be between lord and man. Very often we are told that the lord had\r\nthe commendation and nothing more[247]. Thus it is contrasted with the\r\nsoke:--\r\n\r\n     His predecessor had only the commendation of this, and Harold had\r\n     the soke[248].\r\n\r\n     Of these six free men St Benet had the soke, and of one of them the\r\n     commendation[249].\r\n\r\nAnd the commendation is contrasted with the 'custom,' the _consuetudo_,\r\nperhaps we might say the 'service':--\r\n\r\n     Of the said sokeman Ralph Peverel had a custom of 3 shillings a\r\n     year, but in the Confessor's time his ancestor had only the\r\n     commendation[250].\r\n\r\n     R. Malet claims 18 free men, 3 of them by commendation, and the\r\n     rest for all custom[251].\r\n\r\nAnd the soke is contrasted with the _consuetudo_:--\r\n\r\n     To this manor belong 4 men for all custom, and other 4 for soke\r\n     only[252].\r\n\r\nIn a given case all these bonds may be united:--\r\n\r\n     There are 7 sokemen who are the Saint's men with sake and soke and\r\n     all custom[253].\r\n\r\n     Over this man the Saint has sake and soke and commendation with all\r\n     custom[254].\r\n\r\nThen if the man 'withdraws,' or gives or sells his land, we often read\r\nof the soke 'remaining'; we sometimes read of the commendation, the\r\ncustom, the service 'remaining.'\r\n\r\n     These free men could sell or give their land, but the commendation\r\n     and the soke and sake would remain to St Edmund[255].\r\n\r\n     These men could sell their land, but the soke would remain to the\r\n     Saint and the service (_servitium_), whoever might be the\r\n     buyer[256].\r\n\r\n     They could give and sell their land, but the soke and the\r\n     commendation and the service would remain to the Saint[257].\r\n\r\nBut after all, these distinctions are not maintained with rigour, for\r\nthe soke is sometimes spoken of as though it were a species of\r\n_consuetudo_. We have a tangled skein in our hands.\r\n\r\n[Commendation.]\r\n\r\nThe thread that looks as if it would be the easiest to unravel, is that\r\nwhich is styled 'mere commendation.' The same idea is expressed\r\nby other phrases--'he committed himself to Bishop Herman for his\r\ndefence[258]'--'they submitted themselves with their land to the abbey\r\nfor defence[259]'--'he became the man of Goisfrid of his own free\r\nwill[260]'--'she put herself with her land in the hand of the\r\nqueen[261].' 'Homage' is not a common term in Domesday Book, but if,\r\nwhen speaking of the old time, it says, as it constantly does, that one\r\nperson was the man of another, no doubt it is telling us of a\r\nrelationship which had its origin in an oath and a symbolic\r\nceremony[262]. 'She put herself into the hands of the queen'--we should\r\ntake these words to mean just what they say. An Anglo-Saxon oath of\r\nfealty (_hyldáð_) has been preserved[263]. The swearer promises to be\r\nfaithful and true to his lord, to love all that his lord loves and\r\neschew all that his lord eschews. He makes no distinct reference to any\r\nland, but he refers to some compact which exists between him and his\r\nlord:--He will be faithful and true on condition that his lord treats\r\nhim according to his deserts and according to the covenant that has been\r\nestablished between them.\r\n\r\n[Commendation and protection.]\r\n\r\nTo all seeming there need not be any land in the case; and, if the man\r\nhas land, the act of commendation will not give the lord as a matter of\r\ncourse any rights in that land. Certainly Domesday Book seems to assume\r\nthat in general every owner or holder of land must have had a lord. This\r\nassumption is very worthy of notice. A law of Æthelstan[264] had said\r\nthat lordless men 'of whom no right could be had' were to have lords,\r\nbut this command seems aimed at the landless folk, not at those whose\r\nland is a sufficient surety for their good behaviour. The law had not\r\ndirectly commanded the landed men to commend themselves, but it had\r\nsupplied them with motives for so doing[265]. What did a man gain by\r\nthis act of submission? Of advantages that might be called 'extra-legal'\r\nwe will say nothing, though in the wild days of Æthelred the Unready,\r\nand even during the Confessor's reign, there was lawlessness enough to\r\nmake the small proprietor wish that he had a mightier friend than the\r\nlaw could be. But there were distinct legal advantages to be had by\r\ncommendation. In the first place, the life of the great man's man was\r\nprotected not only by a _wer-gild_, but by a _man-bót_:--a _man-bót_ due\r\nto one who had the power to exact it; and if, as one of our authorities\r\nassures us, the amount of the _man-bót_ varied with the rank of the\r\nlord[266], this would help to account for a remarkable fact disclosed by\r\nDomesday Book, namely, that the chosen lord was usually a person of the\r\nvery highest rank, an earl, an archbishop, the king. Then, again, if the\r\nman got into a scrape, his lord might be of service to him. Suppose the\r\nman accused of theft: in certain cases he might escape with a single,\r\ninstead of a triple ordeal, if he had a lord who would swear to his good\r\ncharacter[267]. In yet other cases his lord would come forward as his\r\ncompurgator; perhaps he was morally bound to do so; and, being a man of\r\nhigh rank, would swear a crushing oath. And within certain limits that\r\nwe can not well define the lord might warrant the doings of his man,\r\nmight take upon himself the task of defending an action to which his man\r\nwas subjected[268]. What the man has sought by his submission is\r\n_defensio_, _tuitio_; the lord is his _defensor_, _tutor_, _protector_,\r\n_advocatus_, in a word, his warrantor[269].\r\n\r\n[Commendation and warranty.]\r\n\r\nOf warranty we are accustomed to think chiefly in connexion with the\r\ntitle to land:--the feoffor warrants the feoffee in his enjoyment of the\r\ntenement. But to all appearance in the eleventh century it is rather as\r\nlord than as giver, seller or lender, that the vouchee comes to the\r\ndefence of his man. If the land is conceived as having once been the\r\nwarrantor's land, this may be but a fiction:--the man has given up his\r\nland and then taken it again merely in order that he may be able to say\r\nwith some truth that he has it by his lord's gift. But we can not be\r\nsure that as yet any such fiction is necessary. 'I will defend any\r\naction that is brought against you for this land':--as yet men see no\r\nreason why such a promise as this, if made with due ceremony, should not\r\nbe enforced. A certain amount of 'maintenance' is desirable in their\r\neyes and laudable.\r\n\r\n[Commendation and tenure.]\r\n\r\nThough we began with the statement that where there is commendation\r\nthere may yet be no land in the case, we have none the less been already\r\nled to the supposition that often enough land does get involved in this\r\nnexus between man and lord. No doubt a landless man may commend himself\r\nand get no land in return for his homage; but with such an one Domesday\r\nBook is not concerned. The cases in which it takes an interest are those\r\nin which a landholder has commended himself. Now we dare not say that a\r\nlandholder can never commend himself without commending his land\r\nalso[270]. Howbeit, the usual practice certainly is that a man who\r\nsubmits or commits himself for 'defence' or 'protection' shall take his\r\nland with him; he 'goes with his land' to a lord. Very curious are some\r\nof the instances which show how large a liberty men have enjoyed of\r\ntaking land wherever they please. 'Tostig bought this land from the\r\nchurch of Malmesbury for three lives':--in this there is nothing\r\nstrange; leases for three lives granted by churches to thegns have been\r\ncommon. But of course we should assume that during the lease the land\r\ncould have no other lord than the church of Malmesbury. Not so, however,\r\nfor during his lease Tostig 'could go with that land to whatever lord he\r\npleased[271].' In Essex there was before the Conquest a man who held\r\nland; that land in some sort belonged to the Abbey of Barking, and could\r\nnot be separated from the abbey; but the holder of it was the man\r\n('merely the man' say the jurors) of one Leofhild the predecessor of\r\nGeoffrey de Mandeville[272]. In this last case we may satisfy ourselves\r\nby saying that a purely personal relation is distinguished from a\r\ntenurial relation; the man of Leofhild is the tenant of the abbey. But\r\nwhat of Tostig's case? Land that he holds of the church of Malmesbury,\r\nand that too by no perpetual tenure, he can commend to another lord.\r\nFrom the man's point of view, protection, defence, warranty, is the\r\nessence of commendation, and the warranty that he chiefly needs is the\r\nwarranty of his possession, of the title by which he holds his land. It\r\ncan not but be therefore that the lord to whom he commends himself and\r\nhis land, should be in some sort his landlord.\r\n\r\n[The lord's interest in commendation.]\r\n\r\nNot that he need pay rent, or perform other services in return for the\r\nland. The land is his land; he has not obtained it from his lord; on the\r\ncontrary he has carried it to his lord. Mere commendation is therefore\r\ndistinguished by a score of entries from a relation that involves the\r\npayment of _consuetudines_. Doubtless however the lord obtains 'a\r\nvaluable consideration' for all that he gives. Part of this will\r\nprobably lie without the legal sphere. He has a sworn retainer who will\r\nfight whenever he is told to fight. But even the law allows the man to\r\ngo great lengths in his lord's defence[273]. In a rough age happy is\r\nthe lord who has many sworn to defend him. When at a later time we see\r\nthat the claimant of land must offer proof 'by the body of a certain\r\nfree man of his,' we are taught that the lords have relied upon the\r\ntestimony and the strong right arms of their vassals. That in all cases\r\nthe lord got more than this we can not say, though perhaps commendation\r\ncarried with it the right to the heriot, the horse and armour of the\r\ndead man[274]. The relation is often put before us as temporary.\r\nNumerous are the persons who 'can seek lords where they choose' or who\r\ncan 'go with their land wherever they please.' How large a liberty these\r\nphrases accord to lord and man it were hard to tell. We can not believe\r\nthat either party to the contract could dissolve it just at the moment\r\nwhen the other had some need to enforce it; but still at other times the\r\nman might dissolve it, and we may suppose that the lord could do so too.\r\nBut the connexion might be of a more permanent kind. Perhaps in most\r\ncases in which we are told that a man can not withdraw his land from his\r\nlord the bond between them is regarded as something other than\r\ncommendation--there is commendation and something more. But this is no\r\nuniversal truth. You might be the lord's man 'merely by commendation'\r\nand yet be unable to sell your land without the lord's leave[275]. At\r\nany rate, in one way and another 'the commendation' is considered as\r\ncapable of binding the land. The commended man will be spoken of as\r\nholding the land under (_sub_) his lord, if not of (_de_) his lord[276].\r\nIn many cases if he sells the land 'the commendation will remain to his\r\nlord'--by which is meant, not that the vendor will continue to be the\r\nman of that lord (for the purposes of the Domesday Inquest this would\r\nbe a matter of indifference) but that the lord's rights over the land\r\nare not destroyed. The purchaser comes to the land and finds the\r\ncommendation inhering in it[277].\r\n\r\n[The seignory over the commended.]\r\n\r\nAnd so, again, the lord's rights under the commendation seem to\r\nconstitute an alienable and heritable seignory. It is thus that we may\r\nbest explain the case, very common in East Anglia, in which a man is\r\ncommended half to one and half to another lord[278]. Thus we read of a\r\ncase in which a free man was commended, as to one-third to Wulfsige, and\r\nas to the residue to Wulfsige's two brothers[279]. In this instance it\r\nseems clear that the commendation has descended to three co-heirs. In\r\nother cases a lord may have made over his rights to two religious\r\nhouses; thus we hear of a man who is common to the Abbots of Ely and\r\nSt. Edmund's[280]. In some cases a man may, in others he may not, be\r\nable to prevent himself being transferred from lord to lord, or from\r\nancestor to heir. What passes by alienation or inheritance may be\r\nregarded rather as a right to his commendation than as the commendation\r\nitself[281]. Of course there is nothing to hinder one from being the man\r\nof several different lords. Ælfric Black held lands of the Abbot of\r\nWestminster which he could not separate from the church, but for other\r\nlands he was the man of Archbishop Stigand[282]. Already a lofty edifice\r\nis being constructed; _B_, to whom _C_ is commended, is himself\r\ncommended to _A_; and in this case a certain relation exists between _C_\r\nand _A_; _C_ is 'sub-commended' to _A_[283].\r\n\r\n[Commendation and service.]\r\n\r\nIn a given case the somewhat vague obligation of the commended man may\r\nbe rendered definite by a bargain which imposes upon him the payment of\r\nrent or the performance of some specified services. When this is so, we\r\nshall often find that the land is moving, if we may so speak, not from\r\nthe man but from the lord. The man is taking land from the lord to hold\r\nduring good behaviour[284], or for life[285], or for lives. A form of\r\nlease or loan (_lǽn_) which gives the land to the lessee and to two or\r\nthree successive heirs of his, has from of old been commonly used by\r\nsome of the great churches[286]. Also we see landowners giving up their\r\nland to the churches and taking it back again as mere life tenants.\r\nDuring their lives the church is to have some 'service,' or at least\r\nsome 'recognition' of its lordship, while after their deaths the church\r\nwill have the land in demesne[287]. This is something different from\r\nmere commendation. We see here the _feuda oblata_ or _beneficia oblata_\r\nwhich foreign jurists have contrasted with _feuda_ or _beneficia data_.\r\nThe land is brought into the bargain by the man, not by the lord. But\r\noften the land comes from the lord, and the tenancy is no merely\r\ntemporary tenancy; it is heritable. The king has provided his thegns\r\nwith lands; the earls, the churches have provided their thegns with\r\nlands, and these thegns have heritable estates, and already they are\r\nconceived as holding them of (_de_) the churches, the earls, the king.\r\nBut we must not as yet be led away into any discussion about the\r\narchitecture of the very highest storeys of the feudal or vassalic\r\nedifice. It must at present suffice that in humbler quarters there has\r\nbeen much letting and hiring of land. The leases, if we choose to call\r\nthem so, the gifts, if we choose to call them so, have created heritable\r\nrights and perdurable relationships.\r\n\r\n[Land-loans and services.]\r\n\r\nThere is no kind of service that can not be purchased by a grant or\r\nlease of land. Godric's wife had land from the king because she fed his\r\ndogs[288]. Ælfgyfu the maiden had land from Godric the sheriff that she\r\nmight teach his daughter orfrey work[289]. The monks of Pershore\r\nstipulate that their dominion shall be recognized by 'a day's farm' in\r\nevery year, that is, that the lessee shall once a year furnish the\r\nconvent with a day's victual[290]. The king's thegns between the Ribble\r\nand the Mersey have 'like villeins' to make lodges for the king, and\r\nfisheries and deer-hays, and must send their reapers to cut the king's\r\ncrops at harvest time[291]. The radmen and radknights of the west must\r\nride on their lord's errands and make themselves generally useful; they\r\nplough and harrow and mow, and do whatever is commanded them[292].\r\n\r\n[The man's _consuetudines_.]\r\n\r\nBut we would here speak chiefly of the lowly 'free men' and sokemen of\r\nthe eastern counties. Besides having their commendation and their soke,\r\nthe lord very often has what is known as their _consuetudo_ or their\r\n_consuetudines_. Often they are the lord's men _de omni consuetudine_.\r\nIn all probability the word when thus employed, when contrasted with\r\ncommendation on the one hand and with soke on the other, points to\r\npayments and renders to be made in money and in kind and to services of\r\nan agricultural character. Of such services only one stands out\r\nprominently; it is very frequently mentioned in the survey of East\r\nAnglia; it is fold-soke, _soca faldae_. The man must not have a fold of\r\nhis own; his sheep must lie in the lord's fold. It is manure that the\r\nlord wants; the demand for manure has played a large part in the history\r\nof the human race. Often enough this is the one _consuetudo_, the one\r\ndefinite service, that the lord gets out of his free men[293]. And then\r\na man who is _consuetus ad faldam_, tied to his lord's fold, is hardly\r\nto be considered as being in all respects a 'free' man. Those who are\r\nnot 'fold-worthy' are to be classed with those who are not 'moot-worthy'\r\nor 'fyrd-worthy.' We are tempted to say that a man's _caput_ is\r\ndiminished by his having to seek his lord's fold, just as it would be\r\ndiminished if he were excluded from the communal courts or the national\r\nhost[294]. From the nature of this one _consuetudo_ and from the\r\nprominence that is given to it, we may guess the character of the other\r\n_consuetudines_. Suit to the lord's mill would be analogous to suit to\r\nhis fold[295]. Of 'mill-soke' we read nothing, but often enough a\r\nsurprisingly large part of the total value of a manor is ascribed to its\r\nmill, and we may argue that the lord has not invested capital in a\r\ncostly undertaking without making sure of a return. We may well suppose\r\nthat like the radmen of the west the free men and sokemen of the east\r\ngive their lord some help in his husbandry at harvest time. From a\r\ndocument which comes to us from the abbey of Ely, and which is slightly\r\nolder than the Domesday Inquest, we learn that certain of St.\r\nEtheldreda's sokemen in Suffolk had nothing to do but to plough and\r\nthresh whenever the abbot required this of them; others had to plough\r\nand weed and reap, to carry the victual of the monks to the minster and\r\nfurnish horses whenever called upon to do so[296]. This seems to point\r\nrather to 'boon-days' than to continuous 'week-work,' and we observe\r\nthat the sokemen of the east like the radmen of the west have horses.\r\nOccasionally we learn that a sokeman has to pay an annual sum of money\r\nto his lord; sometimes this looks like a substantial rent, sometimes\r\nlike a mere 'recognition'; but the words that most nearly translate our\r\n'rent,' _redditus_, _census_, _gablum_ are seldom used in this context.\r\nAll is _consuetudo_.\r\n\r\n[Nature of _consuetudines_.]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting word. We perhaps are eager to urge the dilemma that\r\nin these cases the land must have been brought into the bargain either\r\nby the lord or by the tenant:--either the lord is conceived as having\r\nlet land to the tenant, or the theory is that the tenant has commended\r\nland to the lord. But the dilemma is not perfect. It may well be that\r\nthis relationship is thought of as having existed from all time; it may\r\nwell be that this relationship, though under slowly varying forms, has\r\nreally existed for several centuries, and has had its beginning in no\r\ncontract, in no bargain. In origin the rights of the lord may be the\r\nrights of kings and ealdormen, rights over subjects rather than rights\r\nover tenants. The word _consuetudo_ covers taxes as well as rents, and,\r\nif the sokeman has to do work for his lord, very often, especially in\r\nCambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, he has to do work for the king or for\r\nthe sheriff also. If he has to do carrying service for the lord, he has\r\nto do carrying service (_avera_) for the sheriff also or in lieu thereof\r\nto pay a small sum of money[297]. And another aspect of this word\r\n_consuetudo_ is interesting to us. Land that is burdened with customs is\r\ncustomary land (_terra consuetudinaria_)[298]. As yet this term does not\r\nimply that the tenure, though protected by custom, is not protected by\r\nlaw; there is no opposition between law and custom; the customary tenant\r\nof Domesday Book is the tenant who renders customs, and the more customs\r\nhe renders the more customary he is[299].\r\n\r\n[Justiciary _consuetudines_.]\r\n\r\nThis word _consuetudo_ is the widest of words. Perhaps we find the best\r\nequivalent for _consuetudines_ in our own vague 'dues[300].' It covers\r\nwhat we should call rents; it covers what we should call rates and\r\ntaxes; but further it covers what we should call the proceeds and\r\nprofits of justice. Let us construe a few entries. At Romney there are\r\nburgesses who in return for the service that they do on the sea are quit\r\nof all customs except three, namely, larceny, peace-breach and\r\nambush[301]. In Berkshire King Edward gave to one of his foresters half\r\na hide of land free from all custom, except the king's forfeiture, such\r\nas larceny, homicide, hám-fare and peace-breach[302]. In what sense can\r\na crime be a custom? In a fiscal sense. A crime is a source of revenue.\r\nIn what sense should we wish to have our land free of crimes, free even,\r\nif this be possible, of larceny and homicide? In this sense:--we should\r\nwish that no money whatever should go out of our land, neither by way of\r\nrent, nor by way of tax, rate, toll, nor yet again by way of\r\n_forisfactura_, of payment for crime committed. We should wish also that\r\nour land with the tenants on it should be quit or quiet (_quieta_) from\r\nthe incursions of royal and national officers, whether they be in search\r\nof taxes or in search of criminals and the fines due from criminals, and\r\nwe should also like to put those fines in our own pockets. Justice\r\ntherefore takes its place among the _consuetudines_: 'larceny' is a\r\nsource of income. A lord who has 'his customs,' is a lord who has among\r\nother sources of revenue, justice or the profits of justice[303].\r\n'Justice or the profits of justice,' we say, for our record does not\r\ncare to distinguish between them. It is thinking of money while we are\r\nengaged in questioning it about the constitution and competence of\r\ntribunals. It gives us but crooked answers. However, we must make the\r\nbest that can be made of them, and in particular must form some opinion\r\nabout the _consuetudines_ known as _sake_ and _soke_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [238] We shall see hereafter that some of these so-called 'manors'\r\n        are but small plots and their holders small folk.\r\n\r\n  [239] See above p. 24.\r\n\r\n  [240] D.

There are free men, apparently 120 in number,\r\n        of whom it is written: 'Hii liberi homines qui tempore regis\r\n        Eduardi pertinebant in soca de Bercolt, unusquisque gratis\r\n        dabat preposito per annum 4 tantum denarios, et reddebat socam\r\n        sicut lex ferebat, et quando Rogerius Bigot prius habuit\r\n        vicecomitatum statuerunt ministri sui quod redderent 15 libras\r\n        per annum, quod non faciebant T.

A certain civil jurisdiction belongs to\r\nthe lord as such; if he has tenants enough to form a court, he is at\r\nliberty to hold a court of and for his tenants. This kind of seignorial\r\njustice we call specifically feudal justice. But very often a lord has\r\nother and greater powers than the feudal principle would give him; in\r\nparticular he has the view of frankpledge and the police justice that\r\nthe view of frankpledge implies. All such powers must in theory have\r\ntheir origin in grants made by the king; they are franchises. With\r\nfeudal justice therefore we contrast 'franchisal' justice[304].\r\n\r\n[Private jurisdiction in the Leges.]\r\n\r\nNow if we go back to the Norman period we shall begin to doubt whether\r\nthe feudal principle--the principle which as a matter of course gives\r\nthe lord justiciary powers over his tenants--is of very ancient\r\norigin[305]. The state of things that then existed should be revealed to\r\nus by the Leges Henrici; for, if that book has any plan at all, it is a\r\ntreatise on the law of jurisdiction, a treatise on 'soke.' To this topic\r\nthe writer constantly returns after many digressions, and the leading\r\ntheme of his work is found in the following sentence:--'As to the soke\r\nof pleas, there is that which belongs properly and exclusively to the\r\nroyal fiscus; there is that which it participates with others; there is\r\nthat which belongs to the sheriffs and royal bailiffs as comprised in\r\ntheir ferms; there is that which belongs to the barons who have soke and\r\nsake[306].' But, when all has been said, the picture that is left on our\r\nminds is that of a confused conflict between inconsistent and indefinite\r\nprinciples, and very possibly the compiler in giving us such a picture\r\nis fulfilling the duty of a faithful portrayer of facts, though he does\r\nnot satisfy our demand for a rational theory.\r\n\r\n[Soke in the _Leges Henrici_.]\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it seems plain that there is a seignorial justice which\r\nis not 'franchisal.' Certain persons have a certain 'soke' apart from\r\nany regalities which may have been expressly conceded to them by the\r\nking. But it is not clear that the legal basis of this soke is the\r\nsimple feudal principle stated above, namely, that jurisdiction springs\r\nfrom the mere fact of tenure. An element of which we hear little in\r\nlater days, is prominent in the Leges, the element of rank or personal\r\nstatus. 'The archbishops, bishops, earls and other 'powers'\r\n(_potestates_) have sake and soke, toll, team and infangenethef in their\r\nown lands[307].' Here the principle seems to be that men of a certain\r\nrank have certain jurisdictional powers, and the vague term _potestates_\r\nmay include in this class all the king's barons. But then the\r\nfreeholding _vavassores_ have a certain jurisdiction, they have the\r\npleas which concern _wer_ and _wíte_ (that is to say 'emendable' pleas)\r\nover their own men and their own property, and sometimes over another\r\nman's men who have been arrested or attached in the act of\r\ntrespass[308]. Whatever else we may think of these _vavassores_, they\r\nare not barons and probably they are not immediate tenants of the\r\nking[309]. It is clear, however, that there may be a 'lord' with 'men'\r\nwho yet has no sake or soke over them[310]. We are told indeed that\r\nevery lord may summon his man to stand to right in his court, and that\r\nif the man be resident in the remotest manor of the honour of which he\r\nholds, he still must go to the plea[311]. Here for a moment we seem to\r\nhave a fairly clear announcement of what we call the simple feudal\r\nprinciple, unadulterated by any element of personal rank; still our text\r\nsupposes that the lord in question is a great man, he has no mere manor\r\nbut an honour or several honours. On the whole, our law seems for the\r\ntime to be taking the shape that French law took. If we leave out of\r\nsight the definitely granted franchisal powers, then we may say that a\r\nbaron or the holder of a grand fief has 'high justice,' or if that term\r\nbe too technical, a higher justice, while the vavassor has 'low justice'\r\nor a lower justice. But in this province, as in other provinces, of\r\nEnglish law personal rank becomes of less and less importance. The rules\r\nwhich would determine it and its consequences are never allowed to\r\nbecome definite, and in the end a great generalization surmounts all\r\ndifficulties:--every lord has a certain civil justice over his tenants;\r\nwhatsoever powers go beyond this, are franchises.\r\n\r\n[Kinds of soke in the _Leges_.]\r\n\r\nAs to the sort of jurisdiction that a lord of our Leges has, we can make\r\nno statement in general terms. Such categories as 'civil' and 'criminal'\r\nare too modern for use. We must of course except the pleas of the crown,\r\nof which a long and ungeneralized list is set before us[312]. We must\r\nexcept the pleas of the church. We must except certain pleas which\r\nbelong in part to the king and in part to the church[313]. Then we\r\nobserve that the justice of an archbishop, bishop or earl, probably the\r\njustice of a baron also, extends as high as _infangenethef_, while that\r\nof a vavassor goes no higher than such offences as are emendable. The\r\nwhole matter however is complicated by royal grants. The king may grant\r\naway a demesne manor and retain not only 'the exclusive soke' (i.e. the\r\nsoke over the pleas of the crown), but also 'the common soke' in his\r\nhand[314], and a great man may by purchase acquire soke (for example, we\r\nmay suppose, the hundredal soke) over lands that are not his own[315].\r\nThen again, we may suspect that what is said of 'soke' in general does\r\nnot apply to any jurisdiction that a lord may exercise over his _servi_\r\nand _villani_. As to the _servi_, very possibly the lord's right over\r\nthem is still conceived as proprietary rather than jurisdictional, while\r\nfor his _villani_ (_serf_ and _villein_ are not yet convertible terms)\r\nthe lord, whatever his rank may be, will probably hold a 'hallmoot[316]'\r\nand exercise that 'common soke' which does not infringe the royal\r\npreserves. On the whole, the law of the thirteenth century seems to\r\nevolve itself somewhat easily out of the law of these Leges, the process\r\nof development being threefold: (1) the lord's rank as bishop, abbot,\r\nearl, baron, becomes unimportant; (2) the element of tenure becomes\r\nall-important; the mere fact that the man holds land of the lord makes\r\nhim the lord's justiciable; thus a generalization becomes possible which\r\npermits even so lowly a person as a burgess of Dunstable to hold a court\r\nfor his tenants[317]; (3) the obsolescence of the old law of _wíte_ and\r\n_wer_, the growth of the new law of felony, the emergence in Glanvill's\r\nbook of the distinction between criminal and civil pleas as a grand\r\nprimary distinction, the introduction of the specially royal processes\r\nof presentment and inquest, bring about a new apportionment of the field\r\nof justice and a rational demarcation of feudal from franchisal powers.\r\nStill when we see the lords, especially the prelates of the church,\r\nrelying upon prescription for their choicest franchises[318], we may\r\nlearn (if such a lesson be needed) that new theories could not master\r\nall the ancient facts.\r\n\r\n[The Norman kings and private jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nWhether the Conqueror or either of his sons would have admitted that any\r\njustice could be done in England that was not his justice, we may fairly\r\ndoubt. They issued numerous charters which had no other object than that\r\nof giving or confirming to the donees 'their sake and soke,' and, so far\r\nas we can see, there is no jurisdiction, at least none over free men,\r\nthat is not accounted to be 'sake and soke.' Occasionally it is said\r\nthat the donees are to have 'their court.' However far the feudalization\r\nof justice had gone either in Normandy or in England before the\r\nConquest, the Conquest itself was likely to conceal from view the\r\nquestion whether or no all seignorial jurisdiction is delegated from\r\nabove; for thenceforward every lay tenant in chief, as no mere matter of\r\ntheory, but as a plain matter of fact, held his land by a title derived\r\nnewly and immediately from the king. Thus it would be easy for the king\r\nto maintain that, if the lords exercised jurisdictional powers, they did\r\nso by virtue of his grant, an expressed grant or an implied grant.\r\nGradually the process of subinfeudation would make the theoretical\r\nquestion prominent and pressing, for certainly the Norman nobles\r\nconceived that, even if their justice was delegated to them by the king,\r\nno rule of law prevented them from appointing sub-delegates. If they\r\nclaimed to give away land, they claimed also to give away justice, and\r\nno earnest effort can have been made to prevent their doing this[319].\r\n\r\n[Sake and soke in Domesday Book.]\r\n\r\nReturning from this brief digression, we must consider _sake_ and _soke_\r\nas they are in Domesday Book. For a moment we will attend to the words\r\nthemselves[320]. Of the two _soke_ is by far the commoner; indeed we\r\nhardly ever find _sake_ except in connexion with _soke_, and when we do,\r\nit seems just an equivalent for _soke_. We have but an alliterative\r\njingle like 'judgment and justice[321].' Apparently it matters little or\r\nnothing whether we say of a lord that he has _soke_, or that he has\r\n_sake_, or that he has _soke_ and _sake_. But not only is _soke_ the\r\ncommoner, it is also the wider word; we can not substitute _sake_ for it\r\nin all contexts. Thus, for example, we say that a man renders _soke_ to\r\nhis lord or to his lord's manor; also we say that a piece of land is a\r\n_soke_ of such and such a manor; no similar use is made of _sake_.\r\n\r\n[Meaning of _sake_.]\r\n\r\nNow as a matter of etymology _sake_ seems the easier of the two words.\r\nIt is the Anglo-Saxon _sacu_, the German _Sache_, a thing, a matter, and\r\nhence a 'matter' or 'cause' in the lawyer's sense of these terms, a\r\n'matter' in dispute between litigants, a 'cause' before the court. It is\r\nstill in use among us, for though we do not speak of a sake between two\r\npersons, we do speak of a man acting for another's sake, or for God's\r\nsake, or for the sake of money[322]. In Latin therefore _sake_ may be\r\nrendered by _placitum_:--'Roger has sake over them' will become\r\n'Rogerius habet placita super eos[323]'; Roger has the right to hold\r\nplea over them. Thus easily enough _sake_ becomes the right to have a\r\ncourt and to do justice.\r\n\r\n[Meaning of _soke_.]\r\n\r\nAs to _soke_, this has a very similar signification, but the route by\r\nwhich it attains that signification is somewhat doubtful. We must start\r\nwith this that _soke_, _socna_, _soca_, is the Anglo-Saxon _sócn_ and\r\nhas for its primary meaning a _seeking_. It may become connected with\r\njustice or jurisdiction by one or by both of two ways. One of these is\r\nexplained by a passage in the Leges Henrici which says that the king\r\nhas certain causes or pleas 'in socna i.e. quaestione sua.' The king has\r\ncertain pleas within his investigation, or his right to investigate. A\r\nlater phrase may help us:--the king is entitled to 'inquire of, hear and\r\ndetermine' these matters[324]. But the word might journey along another\r\npath which would lead to much the same end. It means seeking, following,\r\nsuing, making suit, _sequi_, _sectam facere_. The duty known as _soca\r\nfaldae_ is the duty of seeking the lord's fold. Thus _soca_ may be the\r\nduty of seeking or suing at the lord's court and the correlative right\r\nof the lord to keep a court and exact suit. Without denying that the\r\nword has traversed the first of the two routes, the route by way of\r\n'investigation'--in the face of the Leges Henrici we can hardly deny\r\nthis--we may confidently assert that it has traversed the second, the\r\nroute by way of 'suit.' There are several passages which assure us that\r\n_soke_ is a genus of which _fold-soke_ is a species. Thus:--'Of these\r\nmen Peter's predecessor had fold-soke and commendation and Stigand had\r\nthe other soke[325].' In a document which is very closely connected with\r\nthe great survey we find what seems to be a Latin translation of our\r\nword. The churches of Worcester and Evesham were quarrelling about\r\ncertain lands at Hamton. Under the eye of the king's commissioners they\r\ncame to a compromise, which declared that the fifteen hides at Hamton\r\nbelonged to the bishop of Worcester's hundred of Oswaldslaw and ought to\r\npay the king's geld and perform the king's services along with the\r\nbishop and ought 'to seek the said hundred for pleading':--_requirere ad\r\nplacitandum_, this is the main kind of 'seeking' that _soke_\r\nimplies[326]. If we look back far enough in the Anglo-Saxon dooms,\r\nthere is indeed much to make us think that the act of seeking a lord and\r\nplacing oneself under his protection, and the consequences of that act,\r\nthe relation between man and lord, the fealty promised by the one, the\r\nwarranty due from the other, have been known as _sócn_[327]. If so, then\r\nthere may have been a time when commendation and soke were all one. But\r\nthis time must be already ancient, for although we do not know what\r\nEnglish word was represented by _commendatio_, still there is no\r\ndistinction more emphatically drawn by Domesday Book than that between\r\n_commendatio_ and _soca_.\r\n\r\n[Soke as jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nNow when we meet with _soca_ in the Leges Henrici we naturally construe\r\nit by some such terms as 'jurisdiction,' 'justice,' 'the right to hold a\r\ncourt.' We have seen that the author of that treatise renders it by the\r\nLatin _quaestio_. We also meet the following phrases which seem clear\r\nenough:--'Every cause shall be determined in the hundred, or in the\r\ncounty, or in the hallmoot of those who have soke, or in the courts of\r\nthe lords[328]'; '... according to the soke of pleas, which some have in\r\ntheir own land over their own men, some over their own men and\r\nstrangers, either in all causes or in some causes[329]': ... 'grithbrice\r\nor hámsócn or any of those matters which exceed their soke and\r\nsake[330]': 'in capital causes the soke is the king's[331].' So again\r\nour author explains that though a baron has soke this will not give him\r\na right to justice over himself; no one, he says, can have his own\r\nforfeiture; no one has a soke of impunity:--'nullus enim socnam habet\r\nimpune peccandi[332].' The use that Domesday Book makes of the word may\r\nnot be quite so clear. Sometimes we are inclined to render it by _suit_,\r\nin particular when fold-soke is contrasted with 'other soke.' But very\r\ngenerally we must construe it by _justice_ or by _justiciary rights_,\r\nthough we must be careful not to introduce the seignorial court where it\r\ndoes not exist, and to remember that a lord may be entitled to receive\r\nthe wites or fines incurred by his criminous men without holding a court\r\nfor them. Those men may be tried and condemned in a hundred court, but\r\nthe wite will be paid to their lord. Then the word is applied to tracts\r\nof land. A tract over which a lord has justiciary power, or a\r\nwite-exacting power, is his _soke_, and very often his _soke_ is\r\ncontrasted with those other lands over which he has rights of a more\r\ndefinitely proprietary kind. But we must turn from words to law.\r\n\r\n[Seignorial justice before the Conquest.]\r\n\r\nAlready before the Conquest there was plenty of seignorial justice in\r\nEngland. The greatest of the Anglo-Saxon lords had enjoyed wide and high\r\njusticiary rights. Naturally it is of the rights of the churches that we\r\nhear most, for the rights that they had under King Edward they still\r\nclaim under King William. Foremost among them we may notice the church\r\nof Canterbury. On the great day at Penenden Heath, Lanfranc proved that\r\nthroughout the lands of his church in Kent the king had but three\r\nrights; all other justice was in the hands of the archbishop[333]. In\r\nWarwickshire the Archbishop of York has soke and sake, toll and team,\r\nchurch-scot and all other 'forfeitures' save those four which the king\r\nhas throughout the whole realm[334]. These four forfeitures are probably\r\nthe four reserved pleas of the crown that are mentioned in the laws of\r\nCnut--_mundbryce_, _hámsócn_, _forsteal_ and _fyrdwíte_[335]. But even\r\nthese rights though usually reserved to the king may have been made over\r\nto the lord. In Yorkshire neither king nor earl has any 'custom' within\r\nthe lands of St. Peter of York, St. John of Beverley, St. Wilfrid of\r\nRipon, St. Cuthbert of Durham and the Holy Trinity. We are asked\r\nspecially to note that in this region there are four royal highways,\r\nthree by land and one by water where the king claims all forfeitures\r\neven when they run through the land of the archbishop or of the\r\nearl[336]. Within his immense manor of Taunton the Bishop of Winchester\r\nhas pleas of the highest class, and three times a year without any\r\nsummons his men must meet to hold them[337]. In Worcestershire seven of\r\nthe twelve hundreds into which the county is divided are in the heads of\r\nfour great churches; Worcester has three, Westminster two, Evesham one,\r\nPershore one. Westminster holds its lands as freely as the king held\r\nthem in his demesne; Pershore enjoys all the pleas of the free men; no\r\nsheriff can claim anything within the territory of St. Mary of\r\nWorcester, neither in any plea, nor in any other matter[338]. In East\r\nAnglia we frequently hear of the reserved pleas of the crown. In this\r\nDanish district they are accounted to be six in number; probably they\r\nare _griðbrice_, _hámsócn_, _fihtwíte_ and _fyrdwíte_, outlaw's-work\r\nand the receipt of outlaws[339]. Often we read how over the men of some\r\nlord the king and the earl have 'the six forfeitures,' or how 'the soke\r\nof the six forfeitures' lies in some royal manor[340]. But then there is\r\na large tract in which these six forfeitures belong to St. Edmund; some\r\nother lord may have sake and soke in a given parcel of that tract, but\r\nthe six forfeitures belong to St. Edmund; they are indeed 'the six\r\nforfeitures of St. Edmund[341].' Other arrangements were possible. We\r\nhear of men over whom St. Benet had three forfeitures[342]. The lawmen\r\nof Stamford had sake and soke within their houses and over their men,\r\nsave geld, heriot, larceny and forfeitures exceeding 40 ores of\r\nsilver[343]. Certain burgesses of Romney serve the king on the sea, and\r\ntherefore they have their own forfeitures, save larceny, peace-breach\r\nand forsteal, and these belong, not to the king, but to the\r\narchbishop[344]. Sometimes King William will be careful to limit his\r\nconfirmation of a lord's sake and soke to the 'emendable forfeitures,'\r\nthe offences which can be paid for with money[345].\r\n\r\n[Soke as a regality.]\r\n\r\nThat in the Confessor's day justiciary rights could only be claimed by\r\nvirtue of royal grants, that they did not arise out of the mere relation\r\nbetween lord and man, lord and tenant, or lord and villein, seems to us\r\nfairly certain. In the first place, as already said, soke is frequently\r\ncontrasted with commendation. In the second place, as we turn over the\r\npages of our record, we shall see it remarked of some man, who held a\r\nmanor in the days before the Conquest, that he had it with sake and\r\nsoke, and the remark is made in such a context that thereby he is\r\nsingled out from among his fellows[346]. Thus it is said of a little\r\ngroup of villeins and sokemen in Essex that 'their lord had sake and\r\nsoke[347].' Not that we can argue that a lord has no soke unless it is\r\nexpressly ascribed to him. The surveyors have no great interest in this\r\nmatter. Sometimes such a phrase as 'he held it freely' seems to serve as\r\nan equivalent for 'he held it with sake and soke[348].' It is said of\r\nthe Countess Judith, a lady of exalted rank, that she had a manse in\r\nLincoln without sake and soke[348]. Then we are told that throughout the\r\ncity of Canterbury the king had sake and soke except in the lands of the\r\nHoly Trinity (Christ Church), St. Augustin, Queen Edith, and three\r\nother lords[350]. We have a list of fifteen persons who had sake and\r\nsoke in the two lathes of Sutton and Aylesford[351], a list of\r\nthirty-five persons who had sake and soke, toll and team in Lincolnshire\r\n(it includes the queen, a bishop, three abbots and two earls[352]), and\r\na list of nineteen persons who had similar rights in the shires of Derby\r\nand Nottingham[353]. Such lists would have been pointless had any\r\ngeneralization been possible. Then in East Anglia it is common enough to\r\nfind that the men who are reckoned to be the _liberi homines_ of some\r\nlord are under the soke of another lord or render their soke to the king\r\nand the earl, that is to say, to the hundred court. Often enough it is\r\nsaid somewhat pointedly that the men over whom the king and the earl\r\nhave soke are _liberi homines_, and this may for a moment suggest that\r\nthe lord as a matter of course has soke over such of his men as are not\r\nranked as 'free men'; possibly it may suggest that freedom in this\r\ncontext implies subjection to a national as opposed to a seignorial\r\ntribunal[354]. But on the one hand a lord often enough has soke over\r\nthose who are distinctively 'free men[355],' while on the other hand, as\r\nwill be explained below, he has not the soke over his sokeman[356].\r\n\r\n[Soke over villeins.]\r\n\r\nBut we must go further and say that the lord has not always the soke\r\nover his villeins. This is a matter of much importance. An entry\r\nrelating to a manor in Suffolk seems to put it beyond doubt:--In the\r\nhundred and a half of Sanford Auti a thegn held Wenham in King Edward's\r\ntime for a manor and three carucates of land; there were then nine\r\n_villani_, four _bordarii_ and one _servus_ and there were two teams on\r\nthe demesne; Auti had the soke over his demesne and the soke of the\r\nvilleins was in Bercolt[357]. Now Bercolt, the modern Bergholt, was a\r\nroyal manor, the seat of a great court, which had soke over many men in\r\nthe neighbouring villages. To all seeming it was the court for the\r\nhundred, or 'hundred-and-a-half,' of Sanford[358]. Here then we seem to\r\nhave villeins who are not under the soke of their lord but are the\r\njusticiables of the hundred court. In another case, also from Suffolk,\r\nit is said of the lord of a manor that he had soke 'only over the\r\ndemesne of his hall,' and this seems to exclude from the scope of his\r\njusticiary rights the land held by thirty-two villeins and eight\r\nbordiers[359]. We may find the line drawn at various places. Not very\r\nunfrequently in East Anglia a lord has the soke over those men who are\r\nbound to his sheep-fold, while those who are 'fold-worthy' attend the\r\nhundred court[360]. In one case a curious and instructive distinction is\r\ntaken:--'In Farwell lay in King Edward's day the sake and soke of all\r\nwho had less than thirty acres, but of all who had thirty acres the soke\r\nand sake lay in the hundred[361].' In this case the line seems to be\r\ndrawn just below the virgater, no matter the legal class to which the\r\nvirgater belongs. To our thinking it is plain enough that many a\r\n_manerium_ of the Confessor's day had no court of its own. As we shall\r\nsee hereafter, the manors are often far too small to allow of our\r\nendowing each of them with a court. When of a Cheshire manor we hear\r\nthat 'this manor has its pleas in its lord's hall' we are being told of\r\nsomething that is exceptional[362]. In the thirteenth century no one\r\nwould have made such a remark. In the eleventh the _halimote_ or\r\n_hall-moot_ looks like a novelty.\r\n\r\n[Private soke and hundredal soke.]\r\n\r\nSeignorial justice is as yet very closely connected with the general\r\nscheme of national justice. Frequently the lord who has justice has a\r\nhundred. We remember how seven of the twelve hundreds of Worcestershire\r\nare in the hands of four great churches[363]. St. Etheldreda of Ely has\r\nthe soke of five and a half hundreds in Suffolk[364]. In Essex Swain had\r\nthe half-hundred of Clavering, and the pleas thereof brought him in\r\n25_s._ a year[365]. In Nottinghamshire the Bishop of Lincoln had all the\r\ncustoms of the king and the earl throughout the wapentake of\r\nNewark[366]. The monks of Battle Abbey claimed that the sake and soke of\r\ntwenty-two hundreds and a half and all royal 'forfeitures' were annexed\r\nto their manor of Wye[367]. But further--and this deserves\r\nattention--when the hundredal jurisdiction was not in the hands of some\r\nother lord, it was conceived as belonging to the king. The sake and soke\r\nof a hundred or of several hundreds is described as 'lying in,' or being\r\nannexed to, some royal manor and it is farmed by the farmer of that\r\nmanor. Oxfordshire gives us the best example of this. The soke of four\r\nand a half hundreds belongs to the royal manor of Bensington, that of\r\ntwo hundreds to Headington, that of two and a half to Kirtlington, that\r\nof three to Upton, that of three to Shipton, that of two to Bampton,\r\nthat of two to Bloxham and Adderbury[368]. What we see here we may see\r\nelsewhere also[369]. If then King William gives the royal manor of Wye\r\nto his newly founded church of St. Martin in the Place of Battle, the\r\nmonks will contend that they have obtained as an appurtenance the\r\nhundredal soke over a large part of the county of Kent[370].\r\n\r\n[Hundredal and manorial soke.]\r\n\r\nThe law seems as yet, if we may so speak, unconscious of the fact that\r\nunderneath or beside the hundredal soke a new soke is growing up. It\r\nseems to treat _the_ soke over a man or over a piece of land as an\r\nindivisible thing that must 'lie' somewhere and can not be in two places\r\nat once. It has indeed to admit that while one lord has the soke, the\r\nking or another lord may have certain reserved and exalted\r\n'forfeitures,' the three forfeitures or the four or the six, as the case\r\nmay be[371]; but it has no classification of courts. The lord's court,\r\nif it be not the court of an ancient hundred, is conceived as the court\r\nof a half-hundred, or of a quarter of a hundred[372], or as the court of\r\na district that has been carved out from a hundred[373]. Thus Stigand\r\nhad the soke of the half-hundred of Hersham, save Thorpe which belonged\r\nto St. Edmund, and Pulham which belonged to St. Etheldreda[374]; thus\r\nalso the king had the soke of the half-hundred of Diss, except the land\r\nof St. Edmund, where he shared the soke with the saint, and except the\r\nlands of Wulfgæt and of Stigand[375]. But it is impossible to maintain\r\nthis theory. The hundred is becoming full of manors, within each of\r\nwhich a lord is exercising or endeavouring to exercise a soke over all,\r\nor certain classes, of his men. It is possible that in Lincolnshire we\r\nsee the beginnings of a differentiating process; we meet with the word\r\n_frisoca_, _frigsoca_, _frigesoca_. Whether this stands for 'free\r\nsoken,' or, as seems more likely, for 'frið soken,' soke in matters\r\nrelating to the peace, it seems to mark off one kind of soke from other\r\nkinds[376]. We have to remember that in later days the relation of the\r\nmanorial to the hundredal courts is curious. In no accurate sense can we\r\nsay that the court of the manor is below the court of the hundred. No\r\nappeal, no complaint of false judgment, lies from the one to the other;\r\nand yet, unless the manor enjoys some exceptional privilege, it is not\r\nextra-hundredal and its jurisdiction in personal causes is over-lapped\r\nby the jurisdiction of the hundred court: the two courts arise from\r\ndifferent principles[377]. In Domesday Book the feudal or tenurial\r\nprinciple seems still struggling for recognition. Already the Norman\r\nlords are assuming a soke which their _antecessores_ did not enjoy[378].\r\nAs will be seen below, they are enlarging and consolidating their manors\r\nand thereby rendering a manorial justice possible and profitable.\r\nWhether we ought to hold that the mere shock and jar of conquest and\r\ndispossession was sufficient to set up the process which covered our\r\nland with small courts, or whether we ought to hold that an element of\r\nforeign law worked the change, is a question that will never be answered\r\nunless the Norman archives have yet many secrets to tell. The great\r\n'honorial' courts of later days may be French; still it is hardly in\r\nthis region that we should look for much foreign law. It is in English\r\nwords that the French baron of the Conqueror's day must speak when he\r\nclaims justiciary rights. But that the process was far from being\r\ncomplete in 1086 seems evident.\r\n\r\n[The seignorial court.]\r\n\r\nMany questions about the distribution and the constitution of the courts\r\nwe must leave unsolved. Not only does our record tell us nothing of\r\ncourts in unambiguous words, but it hardly has a word that will answer\r\nto our 'court.' The term _curia_ is in use, but it seems always to\r\nsignify a physical object, the lord's house or the court-yard around it,\r\nnever an institution, a tribunal[379]. Almost all that we are told is\r\nconveyed to us under the cover of such words as _sake_, _soke_,\r\n_placita_, _forisfacturae_. We know that the Bishop of Winchester has a\r\ncourt at Taunton, for his tenants are bound to come together thrice a\r\nyear to hold his pleas without being summoned[380]. This phrase--'to\r\nhold his pleas'--seems to tell us distinctly enough that the suitors are\r\nthe doomsmen of the court. Then, again, we have the well-known story of\r\nwhat happened at Orwell in Cambridgeshire. In that village Count Roger\r\nhad a small estate; he had land for a team and a half. This land had\r\nbelonged to six sokemen. He had borrowed three of them from Picot the\r\nsheriff in order that they might hold his pleas, and having got them he\r\nrefused to return them[381]. That the court that he wished to hold was a\r\ncourt merely for his land at Orwell is highly improbable, but he had\r\nother lands scattered about in the various villages of the Wetherly\r\nhundred, though in all his tenants amounted to but 14 villeins, 42\r\nbordiers, 15 cottiers, and 4 serfs. We can not draw the inference that\r\nmen of the class known as sokemen were necessary for the constitution of\r\na court, for at the date of the survey there was no sokeman left in all\r\nRoger's land in Cambridgeshire; the three that he borrowed from Picot\r\nhad disappeared or were reckoned as villeins or worse. Still he held a\r\ncourt and that court had doomsmen. But we can not argue that every lord\r\nwho had soke, or sake and soke, had a court of his own. It may be that\r\nin some cases he was satisfied with claiming the 'forfeitures' which his\r\nmen incurred in the hundred courts. This is suggested to us by what we\r\nread of the earl's third penny.\r\n\r\n[Soke and the earl's third penny.]\r\n\r\nIn the county court and in every hundred court that has not passed into\r\nprivate hands, the king is entitled to but two-thirds of the proceeds of\r\njustice and the earl gets the other third, except perhaps in certain\r\nexceptional cases in which the king has the whole profit of some\r\nspecially royal plea. The soke in the hundred courts belongs to the king\r\nand the earl. And just as the king's rights as the lord of a hundredal\r\ncourt become bound up with, and are let to farm with, some royal manor,\r\nso the earl's third penny will be annexed to some comital manor. Thus\r\nthe third penny of Dorsetshire was annexed to Earl Harold's manor of\r\nPireton[382], and the third penny of Warwickshire to Earl Edwin's manor\r\nof Cote[383]. Harold had a manor in Herefordshire to which belonged the\r\nthird penny of three hundreds[384]; Godwin had a manor in Hampshire to\r\nwhich belonged the third penny of six hundreds[385]; the third penny of\r\nthree Devonian hundreds belonged to the manor of Blackpool[386]. Now, at\r\nleast in some cases, the king could not by his grants deprive the earl\r\nof his right; the grantee of soke had to take it subject to the earl's\r\nthird penny. Thus for the shires of Derby and Nottingham we have a list\r\nof nineteen persons who were entitled to the king's two-pence, but only\r\nthree of them were entitled to the earl's penny[387]. The monks of\r\nBattle declared that throughout many hundreds in Kent they were entitled\r\nto 'the king's two-pence'; the earl's third penny belonged to Odo of\r\nBayeux[388]. And so of certain 'free men' in Norfolk it is said that\r\n'their soke is in the hundred for the third penny[389].' A man commits\r\nan offence; he incurs a _wíte_; two-thirds of it should go to his lord;\r\none-third to the earl: in what court should he be tried? The answer that\r\nDomesday Book suggests by its silence is that this is a matter of\r\nindifference; it does not care to distinguish between the right to hold\r\na court and the right to take the profits of justice. Just once the veil\r\nis raised for a moment. In Suffolk lies the hundred of Blything; its\r\nhead is the vill of Blythburgh where there is a royal manor[390]. Within\r\nthat hundred lies the considerable town of Dunwich, which Edric holds as\r\na manor. Now in Dunwich the king has this custom that two or three men\r\nshall go to the hundred court if they be duly summoned, and if they make\r\ndefault they shall pay a fine of two ores, and if a thief be caught\r\nthere he shall be judged there and corporeal justice shall be done in\r\nBlythburgh and the lord of Dunwich shall have the thief's chattels.\r\nApparently in this case the lord of Dunwich will see to the trying but\r\nnot to the hanging of the thief; but, at any rate, a rare effort is here\r\nmade to define how justice shall be done[391]. The rarity of such\r\nefforts is very significant. Of course Domesday Book is not a treatise\r\non jurisdiction; still if there were other terms in use, we should not\r\nbe for ever put off with the vague, undifferentiated _soke_. On the\r\nwhole, we take it that the lord who enjoyed soke had a right to keep a\r\ncourt if he chose to do so, and that generally he did this, though he\r\nwould be far from keeping a separate court for each of his little\r\nmanors; but if his possessions were small he may have contented himself\r\nwith attending the hundred court and claiming the fines incurred by his\r\nmen. Sometimes a lord seems to have soke only over his own demesne\r\nlands[392]; in this case the wites that will come to him will be few. We\r\nmay in later times see some curious compromises. If a thief is caught on\r\nthe land of the Prior of Canterbury at Brook in Kent, the borhs-elder\r\nand frank-pledges of Brook are to take him to the court of the hundred\r\nof Wye, which belongs to the Abbot of Battle. Then, if he is not one of\r\nthe Prior's men, he will be judged by the hundred. But if he is the\r\nPrior's man, then the bailiff of Brook will 'crave the Prior's court.'\r\nThe Prior's folk will then go apart and judge the accused, a few of the\r\nhundredors going with them to act as assessors. If the tribunal thus\r\nconstituted cannot agree, then once more the accused will be brought\r\nback into the hundred and will there be judged by the hundredors in\r\ncommon. In this instance we see that even in Henry II.'s day the Prior\r\nhas not thoroughly extricated his court from the hundred moot[393].\r\n\r\n[Soke and house-peace.]\r\n\r\nIt seems possible that a further hint as to the history of soke is given\r\nus by certain entries relating to the boroughs. It will already have\r\nbecome apparent that if there is soke over men, there is also soke over\r\nland: if men 'render soke' so also acres 'render soke.' We can see that\r\na very elaborate web of rules is thus woven. One man strikes another.\r\nBefore we can tell what the striker ought to pay and to whom he ought\r\nto pay it, we ought to know who had soke over the striker, over the\r\nstricken, over the spot where the blow was given, over the spot where\r\nthe offender was attached or arrested or accused. 'The men of Southwark\r\ntestify that in King Edward's time no one took toll on the strand or in\r\nthe water-street save the king, and if any one in the act of committing\r\nan offence was there challenged, he paid the amends to the king, but if\r\nwithout being challenged he escaped under a man who had sake and soke,\r\nthat man had the amends[394].' Then we read how at Wallingford certain\r\nowners of houses enjoyed 'the gafol of their houses, and blood, if blood\r\nwas shed there and the man was received inside before he was challenged\r\nby the king's reeve, except on Saturday, for then the king had the\r\nforfeiture on account of the market; and for adultery and larceny they\r\nhad the forfeiture in their houses, but the other forfeitures were the\r\nking's[395].' We can not hope to recover the intricate rules which\r\ngoverned these affairs, rules which must have been as intricate as those\r\nof our 'private international law.' But the description of Wallingford\r\ntells us of householders who enjoy the 'forfeitures' which arise from\r\ncrimes committed in their own houses, and a suspicion may cross our\r\nminds that the right to these forfeitures is not in its origin a purely\r\njurisdictional or justiciary right. However, these householders are\r\ngreat people (the Bishop of Salisbury, the Abbot of St Albans are among\r\nthem), their town houses are considered as appurtenant to their rural\r\nmanors and the soke over the manor comprehends the town house. And so\r\nwhen we read how the twelve lawmen of Stamford had sake and soke within\r\ntheir houses and over their own men 'save geld, and heriot, and\r\ncorporeal forfeitures to the amount of 40 ores of silver and larceny' we\r\nmay be reading of rights which can properly be described as\r\njusticiary[396].\r\n\r\n[Soke in houses.]\r\n\r\nBut a much more difficult case comes before us at Warwick[397]. We first\r\nhear of the town houses that are held by great men as parts of their\r\nmanors, and then we hear that 'besides these houses there are in the\r\nborough nineteen burgesses who have nineteen houses with sake and soke\r\nand all customs.' Now we can not easily believe that the burgess's house\r\nis a jurisdictional area, or that in exacting a mulct from one who\r\ncommits a crime in that house the burgess will be playing the magistrate\r\nor exercising a right to do justice or take the profits of justice by\r\nvirtue of a grant made to him by the king. Rather we are likely to see\r\nhere a relic of the ancient 'house-peace[398].' If you commit an act of\r\nviolence in a man's house, whatever you may have to pay to the person\r\nwhom you strike and to the king, you will also have to make amends to\r\nthe owner of the house, even though he be but a ceorl or a boor, for you\r\nhave broken his peace[399]. The right of the burgess to exact a mulct\r\nfrom one who has shed blood or committed adultery within his walls may\r\nin truth be a right of this kind, and yet, like other rights to other\r\nmulcts, it is now conceived as an emanation of sake and soke. If in the\r\neleventh century we hear but little of this householder's right, may\r\nthis not be because the householder has surrendered it to his lord, or\r\nthe lord has usurped it from the householder, and thus it has gone to\r\nswell the mass of the lord's jurisdictional rights? At Broughton in\r\nHuntingdonshire the Abbot of Ramsey has a manor with some sokemen upon\r\nit 'and these sokemen say that they used to have legerwite\r\n(fornication-fine), bloodwite and larceny up to fourpence, and above\r\nfourpence the Abbot had the forfeiture of larceny[400].' Various\r\ninterpretations may be set upon this difficult passage. We may fashion\r\nfor ourselves a village court (though there are but ten sokemen) and\r\nsuppose that the commune of sokemen enjoyed the smaller fines incurred\r\nby any of its members. But we are inclined to connect this entry with\r\nthose relating to Wallingford and to Warwick and to believe that each\r\nsokeman has enjoyed a right to exact a sum of money for the breach of\r\nhis peace. The law does not clearly mark off the right of the injured\r\nhousefather from the right of the offended magistrate. How could it do\r\nso? If you commit an act of violence you must pay a wite to the king.\r\nWhy so? Because you have wronged the king by breaking his peace and he\r\nrequires 'amends' from you. With this thought in our minds we may now\r\napproach an obscure problem.\r\n\r\n[Vendible soke.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that seignorial justice is regarded as having its origin in\r\nroyal grants, and in the main this seems true. We hardly state an\r\nexception to this rule if we say that grantees of justice become in\r\ntheir turn grantors. Not merely could the earl who had soke grant this\r\nto one of his thegns, but that thegn would be said to hold the soke\r\n'under' or 'of' the earl. Justice, we may say, was already being\r\nsubinfeudated[401]. But now and again we meet with much more startling\r\nstatements. Usually if a man over whom his lord has soke 'withdraws\r\nhimself with his land,' or 'goes elsewhere with his land,' the lord's\r\nsoke over that land 'remains': he still has jurisdictional rights over\r\nthat land though it is commended to a new lord. We may be surprised at\r\nbeing very frequently told that this is the case, for we can hardly\r\nimagine a man having power to take his land out of one sphere of justice\r\nand to put it into another. But that some men, and they not men of high\r\nrank, enjoyed this power seems probable. Of a Hertfordshire manor we\r\nread: 'In this manor there were six sokemen, men of Archbishop Stigand,\r\nand each had one hide, and they could sell, saving the soke, and one of\r\nthem could even sell his soke with the land[402].' This case may be\r\nexceptional; there may have been a very unusual compact between the\r\narchbishop and this egregiously free sokeman; but the frequency with\r\nwhich we are told that on a sale the soke 'remains' does not favour this\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\n[Soke and mund.]\r\n\r\nWe seem driven to the conclusion that in some parts of the country the\r\npractice of commendation had been allowed to interfere even with\r\njurisdictional relationships: that there were men who could 'go with\r\ntheir land to what lord they chose' and carry with them not merely their\r\nhomage, but also their suit of court and their 'forfeitures.' This may\r\nseem to us intolerable. If it be true, it tells us that the state has\r\nbeen very weak; it tells us that the national scheme of justice has been\r\ntorn to shreds by free contract, that men have had the utmost difficulty\r\nin distinguishing between property and political power, between personal\r\nrelationships and the magistracy to which land is subject. But unless we\r\nare mistaken, the house-peace in its decay has helped to produce this\r\nconfusion. In a certain sense a mere ceorl has had what is now called a\r\nsoke,--it used to be called a _mund_ or _grið_--over his house and over\r\nhis loaf-eaters: that is to say, he has been entitled to have money paid\r\nto him if his house-peace were broken or his loaf-eaters beaten. This\r\nright he has been able to transfer to a lord. In one way or another it\r\nhas now come into the lord's hand and become mixed up with other rights.\r\nIn Henry I.'s day a lawyer will be explaining that if a villein receives\r\nmoney when blood is shed or fornication is committed in his house, this\r\nis because he has purchased these forfeitures from his lord[403]. This\r\nreverses the order of history.\r\n\r\n[Soke and jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the best explanation that we can give of the men who sell their\r\nsoke with their land. No doubt we are accusing Domesday Book of being\r\nvery obscure, of using a single word to express some three or four\r\ndifferent ideas. In some degree the obscurity may be due to the fact\r\nthat French justiciars and French clerks have become the exponents of\r\nEnglish law. But we may gravely doubt whether Englishmen would have\r\nproduced a result more intelligible to us. One cause of difficulty we\r\nmay perhaps remove. In accordance with common wont we have from time to\r\ntime spoken of seignorial jurisdiction. But if the word _jurisdiction_\r\nbe strictly construed, then in all likelihood there never has been in\r\nthis country any seignorial jurisdiction. It is not the part of the lord\r\nto declare the law (_ius dicere_); 'curia domini debet facere iudicia et\r\nnon dominus[404].' From first to last this seems to be so, unless we\r\ntake account of theories that come to us from a time when the lord's\r\ncourt was fast becoming an obsolete institution[405]. So it is in\r\nDomesday Book. In the hundred court the sheriff presides; it is he that\r\nappoints a day for the litigation, but the men of the hundred, the men\r\nwho come together 'to give and receive right,' make the judgments[406].\r\nThe tenants of the Bishop of Winchester 'hold the bishops' pleas' at\r\nTaunton; Earl Roger borrows sokemen 'to hold his pleas[407].' Thus the\r\nerection of a new court is no very revolutionary proceeding; it passes\r\nunnoticed. If once it be granted that all the justiciary profits arising\r\nfrom a certain group of men or tract of land are to go to a certain\r\nlord, it is very much a matter of indifference to kings and sheriffs\r\nwhether the lord holds a court of his own or exacts this money in the\r\nhundred court. Indeed, a sheriff may be inclined to say 'I am not going\r\nto do your justice for nothing; do it yourself.' So long as every lord\r\nwill come to the hundred court himself or send his steward, the sheriff\r\nwill have no lack of capable doomsmen. Then the men of the lord's\r\nprecinct may well wish for a court at their doors; they will be spared\r\nthe long journey to the hundred court; they will settle their own\r\naffairs and be a law unto themselves. Thus we ought not to say that the\r\nlax use of the word _soke_ covers a confusion between 'jurisdiction' and\r\nthe profits of 'jurisdiction,' and if we say that the confusion is\r\nbetween justice and the profits of justice, we are pointing to a\r\ndistinction which the men of the Confessor's time might regard as\r\nsomewhat shadowy. In any case their lord is to have their wites; in any\r\ncase they will get the judgment of their peers; what is left to dispute\r\nabout is mere geography, the number of the courts, the demarcation of\r\njusticiary areas. We may say, if we will, that far-sighted men would not\r\nhave argued in this manner, for seignorial justice was a force mighty\r\nfor good and for ill; but it has not been proved to our satisfaction\r\nthat the men who ruled England in the age before the Conquest were\r\nfar-sighted. Their work ended in a stupendous failure.\r\n\r\n[Soke and commendation.]\r\n\r\nTo the sake and soke of the old English law we shall have to return once\r\nmore in our next essay. Our discussion of the sake and soke of Domesday\r\nBook was induced by a consideration of the various bonds which may bind\r\na man to a lord. And now we ought to understand that in the eastern\r\ncounties it is extremely common for a man to be bound to one lord by\r\ncommendation and to another lord by soke. Very often indeed a man is\r\ncommended to one lord, while the soke over him and over his land 'lies\r\nin' some hundred court which belongs to another lord or is still in the\r\nhands of the king and the earl. How to draw with any exactness the line\r\nbetween the rights given to the one lord by the commendation and to the\r\nother lord by the soke we can not tell. For instance, we find many men\r\nwho can not sell their land without the consent of a lord. This we may\r\nusually regard as the result of some term in the bargain of\r\ncommendation; but in some cases it may well be the outcome of soke. Thus\r\nat Sturston in Norfolk we see a free man of St Etheldreda of Ely; his\r\nsake and soke belong to Archbishop Stigand's manor of Earsham (Sturston\r\nand Earsham lie some five miles apart); now this man if he wishes to\r\ngive or sell his land must obtain the licence both of St Etheldreda and\r\nof Stigand[408]. And so as regards the forfeiture of land. We are\r\nperhaps accustomed to think of the escheat _propter delictum tenentis_\r\nas having its origin in the ideas of homage and tenure rather than in\r\nthe justiciary rights of the lord. Howbeit there is much to make us\r\nthink that the right to take the land of one who has forfeited that land\r\nby crime was closely connected with the right to other wites or\r\n_forisfacturae_. 'Of all the thegns who hold land in the Well wapentake\r\nof Lincolnshire, St Mary of Lincoln had two-thirds of every\r\n_forisfactura_ and the earl the other third; and so of their heriots;\r\nand so if they forfeited their land, two-thirds went to St Mary and the\r\nremainder to the earl[409].' St Mary has not enfeoffed these thegns; but\r\nby some royal grant she has two-thirds of the soke over them. In\r\nSuffolk one Brungar held a small manor with soke. He was a 'free man'\r\ncommended to Robert Wimarc's son; but the sake and soke over him\r\nbelonged to St Edmund. Unfortunately for Brungar, stolen horses were\r\nfound in his house, and we fear that he came to a bad end. At any rate\r\nhe drops out of the story. Then St Edmund's Abbot, who had the sake and\r\nsoke, and Robert, who had the commendation, went to law, and right\r\ngladly would we have heard the plea; but they came to some compromise\r\nand to all seeming Robert got the land[410]. If we are puzzled by this\r\nlabyrinthine web of legal relationships, we may console ourselves with\r\nthe reflection that the Normans also were puzzled by it. They seem to\r\nhave felt the necessity of attributing the lordship of land to one lord\r\nand one only (though of course that lord might have another lord above\r\nhim), of consolidating soke with commendation, homage with justice, and\r\nin the end they brought out a simple and symmetrical result, albeit to\r\nthe last the relation of seignorial to hundredal justice is not to be\r\nexplained by any elegant theory of feudalism.\r\n\r\n[Sokemen and free men.]\r\n\r\nYet another problem shall be stated, though we have little hope of\r\nsolving it. The writ, or rather one of the writs, which defined the\r\nscope of the survey seems to have spoken of _liberi homines_ and\r\n_sochemanni_ as of two classes of men that were to be distinguished from\r\neach other. In Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk this distinction is often\r\ndrawn. In one and the same manor we shall find both 'free men' and\r\nsokemen[411]; we may even hear of sokemen who formerly were 'free\r\nmen[412].' But the import of this distinction evades us. Sometimes it is\r\nsaid of sokemen that they 'hold freely[413].' We read that four sokemen\r\nheld this land of whom three were free, while the fourth had one hide\r\nbut could not give or sell it[414]. This may suggest that the principle\r\nof the division is to be found in the power to alienate the land, to\r\n'withdraw' with the land to another lord[415]. There may be truth in the\r\nsuggestion, but we can not square it with all our cases[416]. Often\r\nenough the 'free man' can not sell without the consent of his lord[417].\r\nWe have just met with a 'free man' who had to obtain the consent both of\r\nthe lord of his commendation and of the lord of his soke[418]. On the\r\nother hand, the sokeman who can sell without his lord's leave is no rare\r\nbeing[419], and it was of a sokeman that we read how he could sell, not\r\nonly his land, but also his soke[420].\r\n\r\n[Difference between 'free men' and sokemen.]\r\n\r\nAgain, we dare not say that while the 'free man' is the justiciable of a\r\nnational court, the soke over the sokeman belongs to his lord. Neither\r\nside of this proposition is true. Very often the soke over the 'free\r\nman' belongs to a church or to some other lord[421], who may or may not\r\nbe his lord by commendation[422]. Very often the lord has not the soke\r\nover his sokemen. This may seem a paradox, but it is true. We make it\r\nclearer by saying that you may have a man who is your man and who is a\r\nsokeman, but yet you have no soke over him; his soke 'lies' or 'is\r\nrendered' elsewhere. This is a common enough phenomenon, but it is apt\r\nto escape attention. When we are told that a certain English lord had a\r\nsokeman at a certain place, we must not jump to the conclusion that he\r\nhad soke over that man of his. Thus in Hertfordshire Æthelmær held a\r\nmanor and in it there were four sokemen; they were, we are told, his\r\n_homines_: but over two of them the king had sake and soke[423]. Unless\r\nwe are greatly mistaken, the soke of many of the East Anglian sokemen,\r\nno matter whose men they were, lay in the hundred courts. This prevents\r\nour saying that a sokeman is one over whom his lord has soke, or one who\r\nrenders soke to his lord. We may doubt whether the line between the\r\nsokemen and the 'free men' is drawn in accordance with any one\r\nprinciple. Not only is freedom a matter of degree, but freedom is\r\nmeasured along several different scales. At one time it is to the power\r\nof alienation or 'withdrawal' that attention is attracted, at another to\r\nthe number or the kind of the services and 'customs' that the man must\r\nrender to his lord. When we see that in Lincolnshire there is no class\r\nof 'free men' but that there are some eleven thousand sokemen, we shall\r\nprobably be persuaded that the distinction drawn in East Anglia was of\r\nno very great importance to the surveyors or the king. It may have been\r\na matter of pure personal rank. These _liberi homines_ may have enjoyed\r\na wergild of more than 200 shillings, for in the Norman age we see\r\ntraces of a usage which will not allow that any one is 'free' if he is\r\nnot noble[424]. But perhaps when the Domesday of East Anglia has been\r\nfully explored, hundred by hundred and vill by vill, we shall come to\r\nthe conclusion that the 'free men' of one district would have been\r\ncalled sokemen in another district[425].\r\n\r\n[Holdings of the sokemen.]\r\n\r\nSome of these sokemen and 'free men' had very small tenements. Let us\r\nlook at a list of tenants in Norfolk. 'In Carleton were 2 free men with\r\n7 acres. In Kicklington were 2 free men with 2 acres. In Forncett 1 free\r\nman with 2 acres. In Tanaton 4 free men with 4 acres. In Wacton 2 free\r\nmen with 1-1/2 acres. In Stratton 1 free man with 4 acres. In Moulton 3\r\nfree men with 5 acres. In Tibenham 2 free men with 7 acres. In Aslacton\r\n1 free man with 1 acre[426].' These eighteen free men had but sixteen\r\noxen among them. We think it highly probable that in the survey of East\r\nAnglia one and the same free man is sometimes mentioned several times;\r\nhe holds a little land under one lord, and a little under another lord;\r\nbut in all he holds little. Then again, we see that these small freemen\r\noften have a few bordiers or even a few free men 'below them[427].' And\r\nthen we observe that, while some of them are spoken of as having\r\nbelonged to the manors of their lords, others are reported to have had\r\nmanors of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [304] Hist.

According to him 'la justice rendue par\r\n        les seigneurs' (my seignorial justice) is either 'la justice\r\n        seigneuriale' (my franchisal justice) or 'la justice féodale'\r\n        (my feudal justice).\r\n\r\n  [305] See Liebermann, Leges Edwardi, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  [306] Leg.

Robert of Ouilly for Osney, ibid. p. 251: 'Volo ...\r\n        quod habeant curiam ipsorum liberam de suis hominibus de\r\n        omnimodis transgressionibus et defaltis, et quieti sint tam\r\n        ipsi quam eorum tenentes de omnimodis curiae meae sectis.'\r\n\r\n  [320] See Liebermann, Leg.

In the Inquisitio\r\n        Eliensis (e.g. Hamilton, p. 109) _saca_ is sometimes used\r\n        instead of _soca_ in the common formula 'sed soca remansit\r\n        abbati.' In D.

On the whole we take this nonsense to\r\n        mean that my right of soke is my right to do justice in case\r\n        any one seeks (by way of legal proceedings) anything in my\r\n        land, even though the accusation that he brings be one of\r\n        theft, and even though the stolen goods have not been found on\r\n        the thief. Already the word is a prey to the etymologist.\r\n\r\n  [325] D.

Another\r\n        account of the same transaction, ibid. 77, says 'et\r\n        [episcopus] deraciocinavit socam et sacam de Hamtona ad suum\r\n        hundred Osuualdeslauue quod ibi debent placitare et geldum et\r\n        expeditionem et cetera legis servitia de illis 15 hidis secum\r\n        debent persolvere.'\r\n\r\n  [327] Schmid, Glossar. s. v. _sócen_. The word, it would seem, first\r\n        makes its way into the vocabulary of the law as describing the\r\n        act of seeking a sanctuary and the protection that a criminal\r\n        gains by that act. A forged charter of Edgar for Thorney\r\n        Abbey, Red Book of Thorney, Camb. Univ.

We may construe these terms by breach of the\r\n        king's special peace, attacks on houses, ambush, neglect of\r\n        the summons to the host. In Hereford, D. B. i. 179, the king\r\n        is accounted to have three pleas, breach of his peace,\r\n        hámfare, which is the same as hámsócn, and forsteal; and\r\n        besides this he receives the penalty from a man who makes\r\n        default in military service.\r\n\r\n  [336] D.

Dipl. iv. p. 233. The odd word _burgheristh_ looks like a\r\n        corrupt form of _burhgrið_ (the peace of the _burh_), or of\r\n        _burhgerihta_ (burh-rights, borough-dues), which word occurs\r\n        in the English document.\r\n\r\n  [338] D.

Perhaps when in other parts of England\r\n        the pleas of the crown are reckoned to be but four, it is\r\n        treated as self-evident that the outlaw falls into the king's\r\n        hand, as also the man who harbours an outlaw. If _fihtwíte_ is\r\n        the right word, we must suppose with Schmid (p. 586) that a\r\n        _fihtwíte_ was only paid when there was homicide. A fine for\r\n        mere fighting or drawing blood would not have been a reserved\r\n        plea.\r\n\r\n  [340] D.

What is a manor? The word _manerium_ appears on page after page\r\nof Domesday Book, but to define its meaning will task our patience.\r\nPerhaps we may have to say that sometimes the term is loosely used, that\r\nit has now a wider, now a narrower compass, but we can not say that it\r\nis not a technical term. Indeed the one statement that we can safely\r\nmake about it is that, at all events in certain passages and certain\r\ncontexts, it is a technical term.\r\n\r\n['Manor' a technical term.]\r\n\r\nWe may be led to this opinion by observing that in the description of\r\ncertain counties--Middlesex, Buckingham, Bedford, Cambridge, Huntingdon,\r\nDerby, Nottingham, Lincoln, York--the symbol _M_ which represents a\r\nmanor, is often carried out into the margin, and is sometimes contrasted\r\nwith the _S_ which represents a soke and the _B_ which represents a\r\nberewick. This no doubt has been done--though it may not have been very\r\nconsistently done--for the purpose of guiding the eye of officials who\r\nwill turn over the pages in search of manors. But much clearer evidence\r\nis forthcoming. Throughout the survey of Essex it is common to find\r\nentries which take such a form as this: 'Thurkil held it for two hides\r\nand for one manor'; 'Brithmær held it for five hides and for one manor';\r\n'Two free men who were brothers held it for two hides and for two\r\nmanors'; 'Three free men held it for three manors and for four hides and\r\ntwenty-seven acres[428].' In Sussex again the statement '_X_ tenuit pro\r\nuno manerio[429]' frequently occurs. Such phrases as 'Four brothers held\r\nit for two manors, Hugh received it for one manor[430],'--'These four\r\nmanors are now for one manor[431],'--'Then there were two halls, now it\r\nis in one manor[432],'--'A certain thegn held four hides and it was a\r\nmanor[433],'--are by no means unusual[434]. A clerk writes 'Elmer\r\ntenuit' and then is at pains to add by way of interlineation 'pro\r\nmanerio[435].' 'Eight thegns held this manor, one of them, Alwin, held\r\ntwo hides for a manor; another, Ulf, two hides for a manor; another,\r\nAlgar, one hide and a half for a manor; Elsi one hide, Turkill one hide,\r\nLodi one hide, Osulf one hide, Elric a half-hide[436]'--when we read\r\nthis we feel sure that the scribe is using his terms carefully and that\r\nhe is telling us that the holdings of the five thegns last mentioned\r\nwere not manors. And then Hugh de Port holds Wallop in Hampshire 'for\r\nhalf a manor[437].' But let us say at once that at least one rule of\r\nlaw, or of local custom, demands a definition of a _manerium_. In the\r\nshires of Nottingham and Derby a thegn who has more than six manors pays\r\na relief of £8 to the king, but if he has only six manors or less, then\r\na relief of 3 marks to the sheriff[438]. It seems clear therefore that\r\nnot only did the Norman rulers treat the term _manerium_ as an accurate\r\nterm charged with legal meaning, but they thought that it, or rather\r\nsome English equivalent for it, had been in the Confessor's day an\r\naccurate term charged with legal meaning.\r\n\r\n[The word _manerium_.]\r\n\r\nThe term _manerium_ seems to have come in with the Conqueror[439],\r\nthough other derivatives from the Latin verb _manere_, in particular\r\n_mansa_, _mansio_, _mansiuncula_ had been freely employed by the scribes\r\nof the land-books. But these had as a rule been used as representatives\r\nof the English _hide_, and just for this reason they were incapable of\r\nexpressing the notion that the Normans desired to express by the word\r\n_manerium_. In its origin that word is but one more name for a house.\r\nThroughout the Exeter Domesday the word _mansio_ is used instead of the\r\n_manerium_ of the Exchequer record, and even in the Exchequer record we\r\nmay find these two terms used interchangeably:--'Three free men belonged\r\nto this _manerium_; one of them had half a hide and could withdraw\r\nhimself without the licence of the lord of the _mansio_[440].' If we\r\nlook for the vernacular term that was rendered by _manerium_, we are\r\nlikely to find it in the English _heal_. Though this is not connected\r\nwith the Latin _aula_, still these two words bearing a similar meaning\r\nmeet and are fused in the _aula_, _haula_, _halla_ of Domesday Book.\r\n\r\n[Manor and hall.]\r\n\r\nNow this term stands in the first instance for a house and can be\r\nexchanged with _curia_. You may say that there is meadow enough for the\r\nhorses of the _curia_[441], and that there are three horses in the\r\n_aula_[442]; you may speak indifferently of a mill that serves the\r\nhall[443], or of the mill that grinds the corn of the court[444]. But\r\nfurther, you may say that in Stonham there are 50 acres of the demesne\r\nland of the hall in Creeting, or that in Thorney there are 24 acres\r\nwhich belong to the hall in Stonham[445], or that Roger de Rames has\r\nlands which once were in the hall of St Edmund[446], or that in the hall\r\nof Grantham there are three carucates of land[447], or that Guthmund's\r\nsake and soke extended only over the demesne of his hall[448]. We feel\r\nthat to such phrases as these we should do no great violence were we to\r\nsubstitute 'manor' for 'hall.' Other phrases serve to bring these two\r\nwords very closely together. One and the same page tells us, first, that\r\nHugh de Port holds as one manor what four brothers held as two manors,\r\nand then, that on another estate there is one hall though of old there\r\nwere two halls[449]:--these two stories seem to have the same point.\r\n'Four brothers held this; there was only one hall there[450].' 'Two\r\nbrothers held it and each had his hall; now it is as one manor[451].'\r\n'In these two lands there is but one hall[452].' 'Then there were two\r\nhalls; now it is in one manor[453].' 'Ten manors; ten thegns, each had\r\nhis hall[454].' 'Ingelric set these men to his hall.... Ingelric added\r\nthese men to his manor[455].'\r\n\r\n[Difference between manor and hall.]\r\n\r\nWe do not contend that _manerium_ and _halla_ are precisely equivalent.\r\nNow and again we shall be told of a _manerium sine halla_[456] as of\r\nsome exceptional phenomenon. The term _manerium_ has contracted a shade\r\nof technical meaning; it refers, so we think, to a system of taxation,\r\nand thus it is being differentiated from the term _hall_. Suppose, for\r\nexample, that a hall or manor has meant a house from which taxes are\r\ncollected, and that some one removes that house, houses being very\r\nportable things[457]: 'by construction of law,' as we now say, there\r\nstill may be a hall or manor on the old site; or we may take advantage\r\nof the new wealth of words and say that, though the hall has gone, the\r\nmanor remains: to do this is neater than to say that there is a\r\n'constructive' hall where no hall can be seen. Then again, _manerium_ is\r\nproving itself to be the more elastic of the two terms. We may indeed\r\nspeak of a considerable stretch of land as belonging to or even as\r\n'being in' a certain hall, and this stretch may include not only land\r\nthat the owner of the hall occupies and cultivates by himself or his\r\nservants, but also land and houses that are occupied by his\r\nvilleins[458]: still we could hardly talk of the hall being a league\r\nlong and a league wide or containing a square league. Of _manerium_,\r\nhowever, we may use even such phrases as those just mentioned[459]. For\r\nall this, we can think of no English word for which _manerium_ can\r\nstand, save _hall_; _tún_, it is clear enough, was translated by\r\n_villa_, not by _manerium_.\r\n\r\n[Size of the _maneria_.]\r\n\r\nIf now we turn from words to look at the things which those words\r\nsignify, we shall soon be convinced that to describe a typical\r\n_manerium_ is an impossible feat, for on the one hand there are enormous\r\n_maneria_ and on the other hand there are many holdings called\r\n_maneria_ which are so small that we, with our reminiscences of the law\r\nof later days, can hardly bring ourselves to speak of them as manors. If\r\nwe look in the world of sense for the essence of the _manerium_ we shall\r\nfind nothing that is common to all _maneria_ save a piece of\r\nground--very large it may be, or very small--held (in some sense or\r\nanother) by a single person or by a group of co-tenants, for even upon a\r\nhouse we shall not be able to insist very strictly. After weary\r\narithmetical labours we might indeed obtain an average manor; we might\r\ncome to the conclusion that the average manor contained so many hides or\r\nacres, possibly that it included land occupied by so many sokemen,\r\nvilleins, bordiers, serfs; but an average is not a type, and the\r\nuselessness of such calculations will soon become apparent.\r\n\r\n[A large manor.]\r\n\r\nWe may begin by looking at a somewhat large manor. Let it be that of\r\nStaines in Middlesex, which is held by St Peter of Westminster[460]. It\r\nis rated at 19 hides but contains land for 24 plough-teams. To the\r\ndemesne belong 11 hides and there are 13 teams there. The villeins have\r\n11 teams. There are:--\r\n\r\n           3 villeins with a half-hide apiece.\r\n           4 villeins with a hide between them.\r\n           8 villeins with a half-virgate apiece.\r\n          36 bordiers with 3 hides between them.\r\n           1 villein with 1 virgate.\r\n           4 bordiers with 40 acres between them.\r\n          10 bordiers with 5 acres apiece.\r\n           5 cottiers with 4 acres.\r\n           8 bordiers with 1 virgate.\r\n           3 cottiers with 9 acres.\r\n          13 serfs.\r\n          46 burgesses paying 40 shillings a year.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 mills of 64 shillings and one fish-weir of 6_s._ 8_d._ and\r\none weir which renders nothing. There is pasture sufficient for the\r\ncattle of the vill. There is meadow for the 24 teams, and in addition to\r\nthis there is meadow worth 20_s._ a year. There is wood for 30 pigs;\r\nthere are 2 arpents of vineyard. To this manor belong four berewicks.\r\nAltogether it is worth £35 and formerly it was worth £40.--This is a\r\nhandsome manor.--The next manor that is mentioned would be a fairer\r\nspecimen. It is Sunbury held by St Peter of Westminster[461]. It is\r\nrated at 7 hides and there is land for but 6 teams. To the demesne\r\nbelong 4 hides and there is one team there. The villeins have 4 teams.\r\nThere are:--\r\n\r\n               A priest with a half-virgate.\r\n               8 villeins with a virgate apiece.\r\n               2 villeins with a virgate.\r\n               5 bordiers with a virgate.\r\n               5 cottiers.\r\n               1 serf.\r\n\r\nThere is meadow for 6 teams and pasture enough for the cattle of the\r\nvill. Altogether it is worth £6 and has been worth £7. Within this one\r\ncounty of Middlesex we can see wide variations. There are manors which\r\nare worth £50 and there are manors which are not worth as many\r\nshillings. The archbishop's grand manor at Harrow has land for 70\r\nteams[462]; the Westminster manor of Cowley has land for but one team\r\nand the only tenants upon it are two villeins[463].\r\n\r\n[Enormous manors. Leominster.]\r\n\r\nBut far larger variations than these are to be found. Let us look at a\r\nfew gigantic manors. Leominster in Herefordshire had been held by Queen\r\nEdith together with sixteen members[464]. The names of these members are\r\ngiven and we may find them scattered about over a wide tract of\r\nHerefordshire. In this manor with its members there were 80 hides. In\r\nthe demesne there were 30 teams. There were 8 reeves and 16 beadles and\r\n8 radknights and 238 villeins, 75 bordiers and 82 male and female serfs.\r\nThese in all had 230 teams; so that with the demesne teams there were no\r\nless than 260. Further there were Norman barons paying rents to this\r\nmanor. Ralph de Mortemer for example paid 15_s._ and Hugh de Lacy 6_s._\r\n8_d._ It is let to farm at a rent of £60 and besides this has to support\r\na house of nuns; were it freed from this duty, it might, so thinks the\r\ncounty, be let at a rent of £120. It is a most interesting manor, for we\r\nsee strong traces of a neat symmetrical arrangement:--witness the 16\r\nmembers, 8 reeves, 8 radknights, 16 beadles; very probably it has a\r\nWelsh basis[465]. But we have in this place to note that it is called a\r\nmanor, and for certain purposes it is treated as a single whole. For\r\nwhat purposes? Well, for one thing, it is let to farm as a single whole.\r\nThis, however, is of no very great importance, for landlords and farmers\r\nmay make what bargains they please. But also it is taxed as a single\r\nwhole. It is rated at the nice round figures of 80 hides.\r\n\r\n[Berkeley.]\r\n\r\n[Tewkesbury.]\r\n\r\nNo less handsome and yet more valuable is Berkeley in\r\nGloucestershire[466]. It brought in a rent of £170 of refined money. It\r\nhad eighteen members which were dispersed abroad over so wide a field\r\nthat a straight line of thirty miles would hardly join their uttermost\r\npoints[467]. 'All the aforesaid members belong to Berkeley.' There were\r\n29 radknights, 162 villeins, 147 bordiers, 22 coliberts, 161 male and\r\nfemale serfs, besides some unenumerated men of the radknights; on the\r\ndemesne land were 54-1/2 teams; and the tenants had 192. Tewkesbury also\r\nis a splendid manor. 'When it was all together in King Edward's time it\r\nwas worth £100,' though now but £50 at the most can be had from it and\r\nin the turmoil of the Conquest its value fell to £12[468]. It was a\r\nscattered unit, but still it was a unit for fiscal purposes. It was\r\nreckoned to contain 95 hides, but the 45 which were in demesne were quit\r\nof geld, and matters had been so arranged that all the geld on the\r\nremaining 50 hides had, as between the lord and his various tenants,\r\nbeen thrown on 35 of those hides. The 'head of the manor' was at\r\nTewkesbury; the members were dispersed abroad; but 'they gelded in\r\nTewkesbury[469].'\r\n\r\n[Taunton.]\r\n\r\nNo list of great manors would be complete without a notice of\r\nTaunton[470]. 'The bishop of Winchester holds Tantone or has a mansion\r\ncalled Tantone. Stigand held it in King Edward's day and it gelded for\r\n54 hides and 2-1/2 virgates. There is land for 100 teams, and besides\r\nthis the bishop in his demesne has land for 20 teams which never\r\ngelded.' 'With all its appendages and customs it is worth £154. 12_d._'\r\n'Tantone' then is valued as a whole and it has gelded as a whole. But\r\n'Tantone' in this sense covers far more than the borough which bears\r\nthat name; it covers many places which have names of their own and had\r\nnames of their own when the survey was made[471]. We might speak of the\r\nbishop of Exeter's manor of Crediton in Devon which is worth £75 and in\r\nwhich are 264 villeins and 73 bordiers[472], or of the bishop of\r\nWinchester's manor of Chilcombe in Hampshire where there are nine\r\nchurches[473]; but we turn to another part of England.\r\n\r\n[Large manors in the midlands.]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to see a midland manor with many members we may look at\r\nRothley in Leicestershire[474]. The vill of Rothley itself is not very\r\nlarge and it is separately valued at but 62_s._ But 'to this manor\r\nbelong the following members,' and then we read of no less than\r\ntwenty-one members scattered over a large area and containing 204\r\nsokemen who with 157 villeins and 94 bordiers have 82 teams and who pay\r\nin all £31. 8_s._ 1_d._ Their rents are thus reckoned as forming a\r\nsingle whole. In Lincolnshire Earl Edwin's manor of Kirton had 25\r\nsatellites, Earl Morcar's manor of Caistor 16, the Queen's manor of\r\nHorncastle 15[475]. A Northamptonshire manor of 27 hides lay scattered\r\nabout in six hundreds[476].\r\n\r\n[Town-houses and berewicks attached to manors.]\r\n\r\nIt is common enough to see a town-house annexed to a rural manor.\r\nSometimes a considerable group of houses or 'haws' in the borough is\r\ndeemed to 'lie in' or form part of a manor remote from its walls. Thus,\r\nto give but two examples, twelve houses in London belong to the Bishop\r\nof Durham's manor of Waltham in Essex; twenty-eight houses in London to\r\nthe manor of Barking[477]. Not only these houses but their occupants are\r\ndeemed to belong to the manor; thus 80 burgesses in Dunwich pertain to\r\none of the Ely manors[478]. The berewick (_bereuita_)[479] also\r\nfrequently meets our eye. Its name seems to signify primarily a wick, or\r\nvillage, in which barley is grown; but, like the barton (_bertona_) and\r\nthe grange (_grangia_) of later days, it seems often to be a detached\r\nportion of a manor which is in part dependent on, and yet in part\r\nindependent of, the main body. Probably at the berewick the lord has\r\nsome demesne land and some farm buildings, a barn or the like, and the\r\nvilleins of the berewick are but seldom called upon to leave its limits;\r\nbut the lord has no hall there, he does not consume its produce upon the\r\nspot, and yet for some important purposes the berewick is a part of the\r\nmanor. The berewick might well be some way off from the hall; a manor\r\nin Hampshire had three berewicks on the mainland and two in the Isle of\r\nWight[480].\r\n\r\n[Manor and soke.]\r\n\r\nThen again in the north and east the manor is often the centre of an\r\nextensive but very discrete territory known as its soke. One says that\r\ncertain lands are 'soke' or are 'the soke,' or are 'in the soke' of such\r\na manor, or that 'their soke belongs' to such a manor. One contrasts the\r\nsoke of the manor with the 'inland' and with the berewicks[481]. The\r\nsoke in this context seems to be the territory in which the lord's\r\nrights are, or have been, of a justiciary rather than of a proprietary\r\nkind[482]. The manor of the eastern counties is a discrete, a dissipated\r\nthing. Far from lying within a ring fence, it often consists of a small\r\nnucleus of demesne land and villein tenements in one village, together\r\nwith many detached parcels in many other villages, which are held by\r\n'free men' and sokemen. In such a case we may use the term _manerium_\r\nnow in a wider, now in a narrower sense. In valuing the manor, we hardly\r\nknow whether to include or exclude these free men. We say that the manor\r\n'with the free men' is worth so much[483], or that the manor 'without\r\nthe free men' is worth so much[484], that the manor is worth £10 and\r\nthat the free men pay 40 shillings[485], that Thurmot had soke over the\r\nmanor and over three of the free men while the Abbot of Ely had soke\r\nover the other three[486].\r\n\r\n[Minute manors.]\r\n\r\nFrom one extreme we may pass to the other extreme. If there were huge\r\nmanors, there were also tiny manors. Let us begin in the south-west of\r\nEngland. Quite common is the manor which is said to have land for but\r\none team; common also is the manor which is said to have land for but\r\nhalf a team. This means, as we believe, that the first of these manors\r\nhas but some 120 acres of arable, while the second has but 60 acres or\r\nthereabouts. 'Domesday measures' are, it is well known, the matter of\r\nmany disputes; therefore we will not wholly rely upon them, but will\r\nlook at some of these 'half-team' manors and observe how much they are\r\nworth, how many tenants and how much stock they have upon them.\r\n\r\n     (i) A Somersetshire manor[487]. Half the land is in demesne; half\r\n     is held by 7 bordiers. The only plough beasts are 4 oxen on the\r\n     demesne; there are 3 beasts that do not plough, 20 sheep, 7 acres\r\n     of underwood, 20 acres of pasture. It is worth 12_s._, formerly it\r\n     was worth 10_s._\r\n\r\n     (ii) A Somersetshire manor[488]. A quarter of the land is in\r\n     demesne; the rest is held by 2 villeins and 3 bordiers. The men\r\n     have one team; apparently the demesne has no plough-oxen. No other\r\n     animals are mentioned. There are 140 acres of wood, 41 acres of\r\n     moor, 40 acres of pasture. It is worth 12_s._ 6_d._ and has been\r\n     worth 20_s._\r\n\r\n     (iii) A Somersetshire manor[489]. All the land, save 10 acres, is\r\n     in demesne; 2 bordiers hold the 10 acres. There is a team on the\r\n     demesne; there are 2 beasts that do not plough, 7 pigs, 16 sheep, 4\r\n     acres of meadow, 7 of pasture. Value, 6_s._\r\n\r\n     (iv) A Somersetshire manor[490]. The whole of the arable is in\r\n     demesne; the only tenant is a bordier. There are 4 plough-oxen and\r\n     11 goats and 7 acres of underwood. Value, 6_s._\r\n\r\n     (v) A Devonshire manor[491]. To all seeming all is in demesne and\r\n     there are no tenants. There are 4 plough-beasts, 15 sheep, 5 goats,\r\n     4 acres of meadow. Value, 3_s._\r\n\r\n     (vi) A Devonshire manor[492]. Value, 3_s._ All seems to be in\r\n     demesne; we see no tenants and no stock.\r\n\r\nWe have been at no great pains to select examples, and yet smaller\r\nmanors may be found, manors which provide arable land for but two oxen.\r\nThus\r\n\r\n     (vii) A Somersetshire manor[493] occupied by one villein. We read\r\n     nothing of any stock. Value, 15_d._\r\n\r\n     (viii) A Somersetshire manor[494] with 3 bordiers on it. Value,\r\n     4_s._\r\n\r\n     (ix) A Somersetshire manor[495] with one bordier on it. Value,\r\n     30_d._\r\n\r\nThe lowest value of a manor in this part of the world is, so far as we\r\nhave observed, one shilling; that manor to all appearance was nothing\r\nbut a piece of pasture land[496]. Yet each of these holdings is a\r\n_mansio_, and the Bishop of Winchester's holding at Taunton is a\r\n_mansio_.\r\n\r\n[Small manors in the east.]\r\n\r\nFrom one side of England we will journey to the other side; from Devon\r\nand Somerset to Essex and Suffolk. We soon observe that in describing\r\nthe holdings of the 'free men' and sokemen of this eastern district as\r\nthey were in King Edward's day, our record constantly introduces the\r\nterm _manerium_. A series of entries telling us how 'a free man held _x_\r\nhides or carucates or acres' will ever and anon be broken by an entry\r\nthat tells us how 'a free man held _x_ hides or carucates or acres for a\r\nmanor'[497]. We soon give up counting the cases in which the manor is\r\nrated at 60 acres. We begin counting the cases in which it is rated at\r\n30 acres and find them numerous; we see manors rated at 24 acres, at 20,\r\nat 15, at 12 acres. But this, it may be said, tells us little, for these\r\nmanors may be extravagantly underrated[498]. Let us then look at a few\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n     (i) In Espalle Siric held 30 acres for a manor; there were always 3\r\n     bordiers and one team and 4 acres of meadow; wood for 60 pigs and\r\n     13 beasts. It was then worth 10_s._[499]\r\n\r\n     (ii) In Torentuna Turchetel a free man held 30 acres for a manor;\r\n     there were always 2 bordiers and one team and a half. It is worth\r\n     10_s._[500]\r\n\r\n     (iii) In Bonghea Godric a free man held 30 acres for a manor; there\r\n     were 1 bordier and 1 team and 2 acres of meadow. It was then worth\r\n     8_s_.[501]\r\n\r\n     (iv) Three free men and their mother held 30 acres for a manor.\r\n     There was half a team. Value, 5_s._[502]\r\n\r\n     (v) In Rincham a free man held 30 acres for a manor. There were\r\n     half a team and one acre of meadow. Value, 5_s._[503]\r\n\r\n     (vi) In Wenham Ælfgar a free man held 24 acres for a manor. Value,\r\n     4_s._[504]\r\n\r\n     (vii) In Torp a free man held 20 acres for a manor. One team; wood\r\n     for 5 pigs. Value, 40_d._[505]\r\n\r\n     (viii) In Tudenham Ælfric the deacon, a free man, held 12 acres for\r\n     a manor. One team, 3 bordiers, 2 acres of meadow, 1 rouncey, 2\r\n     beasts that do not plough, 11 pigs, 40 sheep. Value, 3_s._[506]\r\n\r\nWe are not speaking of curiosities; the sixty acre manor was very common\r\nin Essex, the thirty acre manor was no rarity in Suffolk.\r\n\r\n[The manor as a peasant's holding.]\r\n\r\nNow it is plain enough that the 'lord' of such a manor,--or rather the\r\nholder of such a manor, for there was little lordship in the case,--was\r\noften enough a peasant, a tiller of the soil. He was under soke and\r\nunder commendation; commended it may be to one lord, rendering soke to\r\nanother. Sometimes he is called a sokeman[507]. But he has a manor.\r\nSometimes he has a full team, sometimes but half a team. Sometimes he\r\nhas a couple of bordiers seated on his land, who help him in his\r\nhusbandry. Sometimes there is no trace of tenants, and his holding is by\r\nno means too large to permit of his cultivating it by his own labour and\r\nthat of his sons. No doubt in the west country even before the Conquest\r\nthese petty _mansiones_ or _maneria_ were being accumulated in the hands\r\nof the wealthy. The thegn who was the _antecessor_ of the Norman baron,\r\nsometimes held a group, a geographically discontinuous group, of petty\r\nmanors as well as some more substantial and better consolidated estates.\r\nBut still each little holding is reckoned a manor, while in the east of\r\nEngland there is nothing to show that the nameless free men who held the\r\nmanors which are said to consist of 60, 40, 30 acres had usually more\r\nthan one manor apiece. When therefore we are told that already before\r\nthe Conquest England was full of manors, we must reply: Yes, but of what\r\nmanors[508]?\r\n\r\n[Definition of a manor.]\r\n\r\nNow were the differences between various manors a mere difference in\r\nsize and in value, a student of law might pass them by. Our notion of\r\nownership is the same whether it be applied to the largest and most\r\nprecious, or to the smallest and most worthless of things. But in this\r\ncase we have not to deal with mere differences in size or value. The\r\nexamples that we have given will have proved that few, if any,\r\npropositions of legal import will hold good of all _maneria_. We must\r\nexpressly reject some suggestions that the later history of our law may\r\nmake to us. 'A manor has a court of its own':--this is plainly untrue.\r\nTo say nothing of extreme cases, of the smallest of the manors that we\r\nhave noticed, we can not easily believe that a manor with less than ten\r\ntenants has a court of its own, yet the number of such manors is\r\nexceedingly large. 'A manor has freehold tenants':--this of course we\r\nmust deny, unless we hold that the _villani_ are freeholders. 'A manor\r\nhas villein or customary tenants':--even this proposition, though true\r\nof many cases, we can not accept. Not only may we find a manor the only\r\ntenants upon which are _liberi homines_[509], but we are compelled to\r\nprotest that a manor need not have any tenants at all. 'A manor must\r\ncontain demesne land':--this again we can not believe. In one case we\r\nread that the whole manor is being farmed by the villeins so that there\r\nis nothing in demesne[510], while in other cases we are told that there\r\nis nothing in demesne and see no trace of any recent change[511]. Thus,\r\none after another, all the familiar propositions seem to fail us, and\r\nyet we have seen good reason to believe that _manerium_ has some exact\r\nmeaning. It remains that we should hazard an explanation.\r\n\r\n[The manor and the geld.]\r\n\r\nA manor is a house against which geld is charged. To the opinion that in\r\nsome way or another the definition of a manor is intimately connected\r\nwith the great tax we shall be brought by phrases such as the following:\r\n'Richard holds Fivehide of the Earl which Brihtmær held in King Edward's\r\ntime for forty acres and for a manor[512].'--'Two free men who were\r\nbrothers, Bondi and Ælfric held it for two hides and for two\r\nmanors[513].' When we say that a man holds land 'as' or 'for' (_pro_)\r\nforty acres, we mean that his holding, be its real size what it may, is\r\nrated to the geld at forty acres. If we add the words 'and as (or for)\r\none manor,' surely we are still speaking of the geld. For one moment the\r\nthought may cross our minds that, besides a tax on land, there has been\r\nan additional tax on 'halls,' on houses of a certain size or value; but\r\nthis we soon dismiss as most unlikely. To raise but one out of many\r\nobjections: had there been such a house-tax, it would have left plain\r\ntraces of itself in those 'Geld Inquests' of the south-western counties\r\nthat have come down to us. Rather we regard the matter thus:--The geld\r\nis a land-tax, a tax of so much per hide or carucate. In all likelihood\r\nit has been assessed according to a method which we might call the\r\nmethod of subpartitioned provincial quotas. The assumption has been made\r\nthat a shire or other large district contains a certain number of hides;\r\nthis number has then been apportioned among the hundreds of that shire,\r\nand the number allotted to each hundred has been apportioned among the\r\nvills of that hundred. The common result is that some neat number of\r\nhides, five, ten or the like is attributed to the vill[514]. This again\r\nhas been divided between the holdings in that vill. Ultimately it is\r\nsettled that for fiscal purposes a given holding contains, or must be\r\ndeemed to contain, this or that number of hides, virgates, or acres.\r\nThus far the system makes no use of the _manerium_. But it now has to\r\ndiscover some house against which a demand may be made for every\r\nparticular penny of geld. Despite the 'realism' of the system, it has to\r\nface the fact that, after all, taxes must be paid by men and not by\r\nland. Men live in houses. It seeks the tax-payer in his house. Now, were\r\nall the occupiers of land absolute owners of the land that they\r\noccupied, even were it true that every acre had some one person as its\r\nabsolute owner, the task would be simple. A schedule of five columns,\r\nsuch we are familiar with, would set forth 'Owner's Name,' 'Place of\r\nResidence,' 'Description of Geldable Property,' 'Hidage,' 'Amount due.'\r\nBut the occupier is not always the owner; what is more, there is no\r\nabsolute ownership. Two, three, four persons will be interested in the\r\nland; the occupier will have a lord and that lord a lord; the occupier\r\nmay be a serf, a villein, a sokeman; there is commendation to be\r\nconsidered and soke and all the infinite varieties of the power to\r\n'withdraw' the land from the lord. Rude and hard and arbitrary lines\r\nmust be drawn. Of course the state will endeavour to collect the geld in\r\nbig sums. It will endeavour to make the great folk answer for the geld\r\nwhich lies on any land that is in any way subject to their power; thus\r\nthe cost of collecting petty sums will be saved and the tax will be\r\ncharged on men who are solvent. The central power may even hold out\r\ncertain advantages to the lord who will become responsible for the geld\r\nof his tenants or justiciables or commended men. The hints that we get\r\nin divers counties that the lord's 'inland' has borne no geld seem to\r\npoint in this direction, though the arrangements about this matter seem\r\nto have varied from shire to shire[515]. On the pipe rolls of a later\r\nday we see that the geld charged against the magnates is often\r\n'pardoned.' For one reason the king can not easily tax the rich; for\r\nanother he can not easily tax the poor; so he gets at the poor through\r\nthe rich. The small folk will gladly accept any scheme that will keep\r\nthe tax-collector from their doors, even though they purchase their\r\nrelief by onerous promises of rents and services. The great men, again,\r\nmay find advantage in such bargains; they want periodical rents and\r\nservices, and in order to obtain them will accept a certain\r\nresponsibility for occasional taxes. This process had gone very far on\r\nthe eve of the Conquest. Moreover the great men had enjoyed a large\r\nliberty of paying their geld where they pleased, of making special\r\ncompositions with the king, of turning some wide and discrete territory\r\ninto a single geld-paying unit, of forming such 'manors' as Taunton or\r\nBerkeley or Leominster.\r\n\r\n[Classification of men for the geld.]\r\n\r\nIn King Edward's day, the occupiers of the soil might, so it seems to\r\nus, be divided by the financier into three main classes. In the first\r\nclass we place the man who has a manor. He has, that is, a house at\r\nwhich he is charged with geld. He may be a great man or a small, an earl\r\nor a peasant; he may be charged at that house with the geld of a hundred\r\nhides or with the geld of fifteen acres. In the second class we place\r\nthe villeins, bordiers, cottiers. The geld apportioned to the land that\r\nthey occupy is demanded from their lord at his manor, or one of his\r\nmanors. How he recoups himself for having to make this payment, that is\r\nhis concern; but he is responsible for it to the king, not as guarantor\r\nbut as principal debtor. But then, at least in the east and north, there\r\nare many men who fall into neither of these classes. They are not\r\nvilleins, they are sokemen or 'free men'; but their own tenements are\r\nnot manors; they belong to or 'lie in' some manor of their lord. These\r\nmen, we think, can be personally charged with the geld; but they pay\r\ntheir geld at their lord's hall and he is in some measure bound to exact\r\nthe payment.\r\n\r\n[Proofs of connexion between the manor and the geld.]\r\n\r\nAny thing that could be called a strict proof of this theory we can not\r\noffer; but it has been suggested by many facts and phrases which we can\r\nnot otherwise explain. In the first place, our record seems to assume\r\nthat every holding either is a manor or forms part of a manor[516]. Then\r\nwe are told how lands 'geld' at or in some manor or at the _caput\r\nmanerii_. Thus lands which lie many miles away from Tewkesbury, but\r\nwhich belong to the manor of Tewkesbury, 'geld in Tewkesbury[517].'\r\nSometimes the same information is conveyed to us by a phrase that\r\ndeserves notice. A piece of land is said to 'defend itself' in or at\r\nsome manor, or, which is the same thing, to have its _wara_ or render\r\nits _wara_, that is to say, its defence, its answer to the demand for\r\ngeld, there[518]. 'In Middleton two sokemen had 16 acres of land and\r\nthey rendered their _wara_ in the said Middleton, but they could give\r\nand sell their land to whom they pleased[519].' When we are told that\r\ncertain lands are _in warnode Drogonis_ or _in warnode Archiepiscopi_,\r\nit is meant that the lands belong to Drogo or the Archbishop for the\r\npurpose of 'defence' against the geld[520]. It is not sufficient that\r\nland should be taxed, it must be taxed 'in' some place, which may be\r\nremote from that in which, as a matter of physical fact, it lies[521].\r\nOne clear case of a free tenant paying his geld to his lord is put\r\nbefore us:--'Leofwin had half a hide and could withdraw with his land\r\nand he paid geld to his lord and his lord paid nothing[522].' Besides\r\nthis we have cases in which the lord enjoys the special privilege of\r\ncollecting the geld from his tenants and keeping it for his own\r\nuse[523]. A remarkable Kentish entry tells us that at Peckham the\r\narchbishop had an estate which had been rated at six sullungs, and then\r\nthat 'of the land of this manor a certain man of the archbishop held a\r\nhalf-sullung which in King Edward's day gelded with these six sullungs,\r\nalthough being free land it did not belong to the manor save for the\r\npurpose of the scot[524].' Here we have land so free that the one\r\nconnexion between it and the manor to which it is attributed consists in\r\nthe payment of geld--it gelds along with the other lands of the manor.\r\nIn the great lawsuit between the churches of Worcester and Evesham about\r\nthe lands at Hamton, the former contended that these lands should pay\r\ntheir geld along with the other estates of the bishop[525].\r\n\r\n[Land gelds in a manor.]\r\n\r\nLet us observe the first question that the commissioners are to ask of\r\nthe jurors. What is the name of the _mansio_? Every piece of geldable\r\nland is connected with some _mansio_, at which it gelds. Let us observe\r\nhow the commissioners and the jurors proceed in a district where the\r\n_villae_ and the _mansiones_ or _maneria_ are but rarely coincident. The\r\njurors of the Armingford hundred of Cambridgeshire are speaking of their\r\ncountry vill by vill. They come to the vill of Abington[526]. Abington,\r\nthey say, was rated at five hides. Of these five hides the king has a\r\nhalf-hide; this lies in Litlington. Earl Roger has one virgate; this\r\nlies in his manor of Shingay. Picot the sheriff has a half-virgate; this\r\nlies and has always lain in Morden. In what sense important to the\r\ncommissioners or their master can a bundle of strips scattered about in\r\nthe fields of Abington be said to lie in Litlington, in Shingay, or in\r\nMorden? We answer that it gelds there.\r\n\r\n[Geld and hall.]\r\n\r\nHence the importance of the hall. It is the place where geld is demanded\r\nand paid. A manor without a hall is a thing to be carefully noted,\r\notherwise some geld may be lost[527]. A man's land has descended to his\r\nthree sons: if 'there is only one hall,' but one demand for geld need be\r\nmade; if 'each has his hall,' there must be three separate demands. When\r\nwe are told that two brothers held land and that each had his house\r\n(_domus_) though they dwelt in one court (_curia_), a nice problem is\r\nbeing put before us:--Two halls, or one hall--Two manors or one\r\nmanor[528]?\r\n\r\n[The petty manors.]\r\n\r\nThe petty _maneria_ of Suffolk, what can they be but holdings which geld\r\nby themselves? The holders of them are not great men, they have no\r\ntenants or just two or three bordiers; sometimes they can not 'withdraw'\r\ntheir lands from their lords. But still they pay their own taxes at\r\ntheir own houses.\r\n\r\n[The lord and his man's taxes.]\r\n\r\nIn supposing that forces have been at work which tend to make the lord\r\nresponsible for the taxes of his men, we are not without a warrant in\r\nthe ancient dooms. 'If a king's thegn or a lord of land (_landrica_)\r\nneglects to pay the Rome penny, let him forfeit ten half-marks, half to\r\nChrist, half to the king. If a \"townsman\" withholds the penny, let the\r\nlord of the land pay the penny and take an ox from the man, and if the\r\nlord neglects to do this, then let Christ and the king receive the full\r\n_bót_ of 12 ores[529].' The right of doing justice is also the duty of\r\ndoing justice. It is natural that the lord with soke should become a\r\ntax-gatherer, and he will gladly guarantee the taxes if thereby he can\r\nprevent the king's officers from entering his precinct and meddling with\r\nhis justiciables. At no time has the state found it easy to collect\r\ntaxes from the poor; over and over again it has been glad to avail\r\nitself of the landlord's intermediation[530].\r\n\r\n[Distinction between villeins and sokemen.]\r\n\r\nOur theory that while the lord is directly and primarily responsible for\r\nthe geld of his villeins, he is but subsidiarily responsible for the\r\ngeld of those of his sokemen or 'free men' who are deemed to belong to\r\nhis manor, is founded in part on what we take to have been the wording\r\nof King William's writ[531], in part on the form taken by the returns\r\nmade thereto. The writ draws a marked line between the villein and the\r\nsokeman. The king wishes to know how much land each sokeman, each _liber\r\nhomo_, holds; he does not care that any distinction should be drawn\r\nbetween the lord's demesne lands and the lands of the villeins. And, on\r\nthe whole, his commands are obeyed. A typical entry in the survey of\r\nEast Anglia will first describe in one mass the land held by the lord\r\nand his villeins, will tell us how many carucates this land is rated at,\r\nhow many teams there are on the demesne, and how many the men have, then\r\nit will enumerate sheep and pigs and goats, and then, as it were in an\r\nappendix, it will add that so many sokemen belong to this manor and that\r\nbetween them they hold so many carucates or acres[532]. In Suffolk even\r\nthe names of these humble tenants are sometimes recorded[533]. And then,\r\nwe have seen[534] that there is some doubt as to whether or no these men\r\nare or are not to be reckoned as part of the manor for all purposes. We\r\nhave to say that the manor 'with the free men,' or 'without the free\r\nmen' is worth so much.\r\n\r\n[The lord's subsidiary liability.]\r\n\r\nAfter all, we are only supposing that the fashion in which the danegeld\r\nwas put in charge resembled in some of its main outlines the fashion in\r\nwhich a very similar tax was put in charge under Richard I. In 1194 the\r\nland-tax that was levied for the payment of the king's ransom seems to\r\nhave been assessed according to the hidage stated in Domesday Book[535].\r\nThen in 1198 a new assessment was made. We are told that the king\r\nordained that every baron should with the sheriffs aid distrain his men\r\nto pay the tax cast upon them, and that if, owing to the baron's\r\ndefault, distresses were not made, then the amount due from the baron's\r\nmen should be seized from the baron's own demesne and he should be left\r\nto recoup himself as best he could[536]. Now it is a liability of this\r\nsort that we are venturing to carry back into the Confessor's day. The\r\nlord is responsible to the state as principal, and indeed as sole,\r\ndebtor for so much of the geld as is due from his demesne land and from\r\nthe land of his _villani_, while as regards any lands of 'free men' or\r\nsokemen which are attached to his manor, his liability is not primary\r\nnor absolute; he is bound to take measures to make these men pay their\r\ntaxes; if he fails in this duty, then their taxes will become due from\r\nhis demesne[537].\r\n\r\n[Manors distributed to the Frenchmen.]\r\n\r\nWhen we read that in Nottinghamshire the relief of the thegn who had six\r\nmanors or less was three marks, while his who had more than six manors\r\nwas eight pounds[538], this may seem to hint that some inferior limit\r\nwas set to the size of the manor. If so, it was drawn at a very low\r\npoint in the scale of tenements. Possibly some general rule had\r\ncompelled all men who held less than a bovate or half-virgate to 'add'\r\nthemselves to the manor of some lord. But the Nottinghamshire rule is\r\nrude and arbitrary. He who has seven houses against which geld is\r\ncharged is a big man. On the other hand, it is probable that the Norman\r\nlords brought with them some notion, and not a very modest notion, of\r\nwhat a reasonably sufficient _manerium_ should be. The king has in some\r\ncases rewarded them by a promise of ten or twenty manors without\r\nspecifying very carefully what those manors are to be like. He has\r\npromised Count Eustace a hundred manors[539]. Thus we would explain a\r\nnot uncommon class of entries:--'fourteen free men commended to Wulfsige\r\nwere delivered to Rainald to make up (_ad perficiendum_) this manor of\r\nCarlington[540].'--'in Berningham a free man held 20 acres of land and\r\nthis was delivered to Walter Giffard to make up Letheringsett[541].'--\r\n'Peter claims the land which belonged to seventeen free men as having\r\nbeen delivered to him to make up this manor[542].'--'This land was\r\ndelivered to Peter to make up some, but his men do not know what,\r\nmanor[543].' The small 'free men' of the east have been 'added to'\r\nmanors to which they did not belong in King Edward's day. A few of the\r\nfree men of Suffolk still 'remain in the king's hand' ready to be\r\ndelivered out to complete the manors of their conquerors[544]. Here too\r\nwe may perhaps find the explanation of the entry which says that Hugh de\r\nPort held Wallop 'for half a manor[545].' The king has promised him a\r\ndozen or score of manors; and this estate at Wallop worth but fifteen\r\nshillings a year, really no gentleman would take it for a manor.\r\n\r\n[Summary.]\r\n\r\nSuch then is the best explanation that we can offer of the _manerium_ of\r\nDomesday Book. About details we may be wrong, but that this term has a\r\ntechnical meaning which is connected with the levy of the danegeld we\r\ncan not doubt. It loses that meaning in course of time because the\r\ndanegeld gives way before newer forms of taxation. It never again\r\nacquires a technical meaning until the late days when retrospective\r\nlawyers find the essence of a manor in its court[546].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [428] D.

Glastonbury Rentalia, 39: 'Thomas\r\n        de Wika tenet 5 acras et 50 oves matrices et 12 vaccas ...\r\n        Philippus de Wika tenet unum ferlingum et 50 oves matrices et\r\n        12 vaccas.'

But instances\r\n        may be found in many other parts of England. Thus in Sussex,\r\n        i. 24, two free men held as two manors land rated at a hide\r\n        and sufficient for one team; it is now tilled by four\r\n        villeins. In the Isle of Wight, D. B. i. 39 b, five free men\r\n        held as five manors land sufficient for two teams; it is now\r\n        tilled by four villeins. In Gloucestershire, D. B. i. 170, is\r\n        a manor worth ten shillings with two serfs upon it; also a\r\n        manor rated at one virgate. In Derbyshire, D. B. i. 274 b,\r\n        land sufficient for four teams and rated as four carucates had\r\n        formed eight manors. In Nottinghamshire, D. B. i. 285 b, land\r\n        sufficient for a team and a half and valued at ten shillings\r\n        had formed five manors for five thegns, each of whom had his\r\n        hall.\r\n\r\n  [509] D.

To\r\n        say of the second of these two plots that it neither is a\r\n        manor nor yet belongs to a manor, is to say that it is\r\n        shirking the geld. D. B. i. 48: 'Walerannus tenet Dene....\r\n        Ista tera non adiacet ulli suo manerio.' Here _suo_ =\r\n        _Waleranni_.

The baron's _homines_\r\n        we take to be freeholders; he would be absolutely liable for\r\n        the tax cast upon his villeinage. As to the tax of 1198 see\r\n        Eng. Hist. Rev. iii. 501, 701; iv. 105, 108.\r\n\r\n  [537] In Dial. de Scac. ii. 14, the author tells us that until\r\n        recently if a baron who owed money to the crown was insolvent,\r\n        the goods of his knights could be seized. The idea of\r\n        subsidiary liability is not too subtle for the time.\r\n\r\n  [538] Above, p. 108.\r\n\r\n  [539] D.

(1) Some\r\n        manors are free of geld, and therefore to make our definition\r\n        correct we ought to say that a manor is a tenement which\r\n        either pays its geld at a single place or which would do so\r\n        were it not freed from the tax by some special privilege. A\r\n        _manerium_ does not cease to be a _manerium_ by being freed\r\n        from geld. (2) In later days we may well find a manor holden\r\n        of another manor, so that a plot of land may be within two\r\n        manors. If this usage of the term can be traced back into\r\n        Domesday Book as a common phenomenon, then our doctrine is in\r\n        great jeopardy. But we have noticed no passage which clearly\r\n        and unambiguously says that a tract of land was _at one and\r\n        the same time_ both a _manerium_ and also a part of another\r\n        _manerium_. To this we must add that of the distribution of\r\n        _maneria_ T. R. E. we only obtain casual and very imperfect\r\n        tidings. If T. R. W. a free man has been 'added to' a\r\n        _manerium_, the commissioners have no deep interest in the\r\n        inquiry whether T. R. E. his tenement was itself an\r\n        independent _manerium_. A great simplification has been\r\n        effected and the number of _maneria_ has been largely reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Manor and Vill._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Manorial and non-manorial vills.]\r\n\r\nAfter what has now been said, it is needless to repeat that in Domesday\r\nBook the _manerium_ and the _villa_ are utterly different things[547].\r\nIn a given case the two may coincide, and throughout a great tract of\r\nEngland such cases were common and we may even say that they were\r\nnormal. But in the east this was not so. We may easily find a village\r\nwhich taken as a whole has been utterly free from seignorial domination.\r\nOrwell in Cambridgeshire will be a good example[548].\r\n\r\n[The vill of Orwell.]\r\n\r\nIn King Edward's day this vill of Orwell was rated at 4 hides: probably\r\nit was somewhat underrated for at the date of the survey it was deemed\r\ncapable of finding land for nearly 6 teams. The following table will\r\nshow who held the four hides before the Conquest:--\r\n\r\n                                                H.     V.

But then how slight an interest it was! Every\r\none of the tenants was free to 'withdraw himself,' 'to give or sell his\r\nland.' Now we can not say that all of them were peasants. Achil the man\r\nof Harold seems to have had other lands in the neighbouring villages of\r\nHarlton and Barrington[550]. It is probable that Turbert, Edith's man,\r\nhad another virgate at Kingston[551]: he was one of the jurors of the\r\nhundred in which Orwell lay[552]. Sigar the man of Æsgar was another\r\njuror, and held land at Thriplow, Foxton, Haslingfield and Shepreth; he\r\nseems to have been his lord's steward[553]. But we may be fairly certain\r\nthat the unnamed sokemen tilled their own soil, though perhaps they had\r\nhelp from a few cottagers. And they can not have been constantly\r\nemployed in cultivating the demesne lands of their lords. They must go\r\nsome distance to find any such demesne lands. The Wetherley hundred, in\r\nwhich Orwell lies, is full of the sokemen of these great folk: Waltheof,\r\nfor example, has 3 men in Comberton, 4 in Barton, 3 in Grantchester, 1\r\nin Wratworth: but he has no demesne land, and if he had it, he could not\r\nget it tilled by these scattered tenants. The Fair Edith has half a hide\r\nin Haslingfield and we are told that this belongs to the manor of\r\nSwavesey. Now at Swavesey Edith has a considerable manor[554], but it\r\ncan not have got much in the way of labour out of a tenant who lived at\r\nHaslingfield, for the two villages are a long ten miles apart. As to the\r\nking's sokemen, their only recorded services are the _avera_ and the\r\n_inward_. The former seems to be a carrying service done at the\r\nsheriff's bidding and to be only exigible when the king comes into the\r\nshire, while _inward_ seems to be the duty of forming a body guard for\r\nthe king while he is in the shire:--if in any year the king did not\r\ncome, a small sum of money was taken instead[555].\r\n\r\n[A Cambridgeshire hundred.]\r\n\r\nLest it should be thought that in picking out the village of Orwell we\r\nhave studiously sought a rare case, we will here set out in a tabular\r\nform what we can learn of the state of the hundred in which Orwell lies.\r\nThe Wetherley hundred contained twelve vills: it was a land of true\r\nvillages which until very lately had wide open fields[556]. In the\r\nConfessor's day the lands in it were allotted thus:--\r\n\r\n                CAMBRIDGESHIRE. WETHERLEY HUNDRED[557].\r\n\r\n  I. COMBERTON.

In no one case was\r\nthe whole of a village coincident with a manor, with a lord's estate.\r\nThe king had considerable manors in Comberton and Haslingfield. Sigar\r\nhad a manor at Haslingfield; the church of Chatteris had a manor at\r\nBarrington besides some land at Shepreth; Wimpole was divided between\r\nEdith and Earl Gyrth; Harlton between Achil and Godman. But in Barton,\r\nGrantchester, Shepreth, Orwell, Wratworth, Whitwell and Arrington we see\r\nnothing manorial, unless we hold ourselves free to use that term of a\r\nlittle tenement which to all appearance might easily be cultivated by\r\nthe labour of one household, at all events with occasional help supplied\r\nby a few cottagers. Indeed it is difficult to say what profit some of\r\nthe great people whose names we have mentioned were deriving from those\r\nof their men who dwelt in the Wetherley hundred. We take the Mercian\r\nearl for example[563]. One of the sokemen of Grantchester, four of the\r\nsokemen of Barrington, one of the sokemen of Shepreth, one of the\r\nsokemen of Orwell, one of the sokemen of Wratworth, two of the sokemen\r\nof Whitwell were Ælfgar's men. That Ælfgar got a little money or a\r\nlittle provender out of them is probable, that they did some carrying\r\nservice for him is possible and perhaps they aided him at harvest time\r\non some manor of his in another part of the county; but that they were\r\nnot the tillers of his land seems clear[564].\r\n\r\n[The sokeman and seignorial justice.]\r\n\r\nWhat is more, our analysis of this Wetherley hundred enables us to drive\r\nhome the remark that very often a sokeman was not the sokeman of his\r\nlord or, in other words, that he was not under seignorial justice[565].\r\nÆlfgar had ten sokemen scattered about in six villages. Did he hold a\r\ncourt for them? We think not. Did they go to the court of some distant\r\nmanor? We think not. The court they attended was the Wetherley\r\nhundred-moot. One of the sokemen in Arrington was in a somewhat\r\nexceptional position--exceptional, that is, in this hundred. Not only\r\nwas he the man of the Abbot of Ely, but his soke belonged to the Abbot;\r\nand if he sold his tenement, and this he could do without the Abbot's\r\nconsent, the soke over his land would 'remain' to the Abbot[566]. He was\r\nnot only his lord's man but his lord's justiciable and probably attended\r\nsome court outside the hundred. But for the more part these men of\r\nWetherley were not the justiciables of their lords. It was a very free\r\nhundred when the Normans came there: much too free for the nation's\r\nwelfare we may think, for these sokemen could go with their land to what\r\nlord they pleased. Also be it noted in passing that the churches have\r\nlittle in Wetherley.\r\n\r\n[Changes in the Wetherley hundred.]\r\n\r\nIn 1086 there had been a change. The sokemen had disappeared. The Norman\r\nlords had made demesne land where their English _antecessores_ possessed\r\nnone. Count Roger had instituted a seignorial court at Orwell. He had\r\nborrowed three sokemen 'to hold his pleas' from Picot the sheriff and\r\nhad refused to give them up again[567]. Apparently they had sunk to the\r\nlevel of _villani_. Two centuries afterwards we see the hundred of\r\nWetherley once more. There is villeinage enough in it. The villein at\r\nOrwell, for example, holds only 10 acres but works for his lord on 152\r\ndays in the year, besides boon-days[568]. And yet we should go far\r\nastray if we imposed upon these Cambridgeshire villages that neat\r\nmanorial system which we see at its neatest and strongest in the\r\nabbatial cartularies. The villages do not become manors. The manors are\r\nsmall. The manors are intermixed in the open fields. There are often\r\nfreeholders in the village who are not the tenants of any lord who has a\r\nmanor there. A villein will hold two tenements of two lords. The villein\r\nof one lord will be the freeholder of another. The 'manorial system' has\r\nbeen forced upon the villages, but it fits them badly[569].\r\n\r\n[Manorialism in Cambridgeshire.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the common field of a Cambridgeshire village\r\nwas often a very maze of proprietary rights, and yet the village was an\r\nagrarian whole. Let us take, for example, Duxford as it stood in the\r\nreign of Edward I.[570] We see 39 villein tenements each of which has\r\nfourteen acres in the fields. These tenements are divided between five\r\ndifferent manors. Four of our typical 'townsmen' hold of Henry de Lacy,\r\nwho holds of Simon de Furneaux, who holds of the Count of Britanny, who\r\nholds of the king. Two hold of Ralph of Duxford, who holds of Basilia\r\nwife of Baldwyn of St George, who holds of William Mortimer, who holds\r\nof Simon de Furneaux, who holds of the Count of Britanny, who holds of\r\nthe king. Eight hold of the Templars, who hold of Roger de Colville, who\r\nholds of the Earl of Albemarle, who holds of the king. Nine hold of\r\nWilliam le Goyz, who holds of Henry of Boxworth, who holds of Richard de\r\nFreville, who holds of the king. Sixteen hold of John d'Abernon, who\r\nholds of the Earl Marshal, who holds of the king. Three of the greatest\r\n'honours' in England are represented. Three monasteries and two\r\nparochial churches have strips in the fields. And yet there are normal\r\ntenements cut according to one pattern, tenements of fourteen acres the\r\nholders of which, though their other services may differ, pay for the\r\nmore part an equal rent[571]. The village seems to say that it must be\r\none, though the lords would make it many. And then we look back to the\r\nConfessor's day and we see that a good part of Duxford was held by\r\nsokemen[572].\r\n\r\n[The sokemen and the manors.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall be guilty of needless repetition; but what is written\r\nin Domesday Book about _maneria_ is admirably designed for the deception\r\nof modern readers whose heads are full of 'the manorial system.'\r\nTherefore let us look at two Hertfordshire villages. In one of them\r\nthere is a _manerium_ which Ralph Basset holds of Robert of Ouilly[573].\r\nIt has been rated at 4, but is now rated at 2 hides. There is land for 4\r\nteams. In demesne are 2 teams; and 3-1/2 _villani_ with 2 sokemen of 1\r\nhide and 5 _bordarii_ have 2 teams. There are 1 cottager and 1 serf and\r\na mill of 10 shillings and meadow for 3 teams. It is now worth £3; in\r\nKing Edward's day it was worth £5. Now here, we say, is a pretty little\r\nmanor of the common kind. Let us then explore its past history. 'Five\r\nsokemen held this manor.' Yes, we say, before the Conquest this manor\r\nwas held in physically undivided shares by five lords. Their shares were\r\nsmall and they were humble people; but still they had a manor. But let\r\nus read further. 'Two of them were the men of Brihtric and held 1-1/2\r\nhides; other two were the men of Osulf the son of Frane and held 1-1/2\r\nhides; and the fifth was the man of Eadmer Atule and held a hide.' We\r\nwill at once finish the story and see how Robert of Ouilly came by this\r\nmanor. 'No one of these five sokemen belonged to his _antecessor_ Wigot;\r\nevery one of them might sell his land. One of them bought (i.e.\r\nredeemed) his land for nine ounces of gold from King William, so the men\r\nof the hundred say, and afterwards turned for protection to Wigot.' So\r\nRobert's title to this manor is none of the best. But are we sure that\r\nbefore the Conquest there was anything that we should call a manor?\r\nThese five sokemen who have unequal shares, who have three different\r\nlords, who hold in all but 4 team-lands, whose land is worth but £5, do\r\nnot look like a set of coparceners to whom a 'manor' has descended. When\r\nRobert of Ouilly has got his manor there are upon it 2 sokemen, 3\r\nvilleins, 5 _bordarii_, a cottager and a serf. It was not a splendid\r\nmanor for five lords.\r\n\r\n[Hertfordshire sokemen.]\r\n\r\nWe turn over a few pages. Hardouin of Eschalers has a manor rated at\r\n5-1/2 hides[574]. It contains land for 8 teams. In demesne are 2 hides\r\nless 20 acres, and 3 teams; 11 _villani_ with the priest and 5\r\n_bordarii_ have 5 teams. There are 4 cottagers and 6 serfs. It is worth\r\n£9; in the Confessor's day it was worth £10. Who held this manor in the\r\npast? Nine sokemen held it. Rather a large party of joint lords, we say;\r\nbut still, families will grow. Howbeit, we must finish the\r\nsentence:--'Of these, one, Sired by name, was the man of Earl Harold and\r\nheld 1 hide and 3 virgates for a manor; another, Alfred, a man of Earl\r\nÆlfgar, held 1-1/2 hides for a manor; and the other seven were sokemen\r\nof King Edward and held 2 hides and 1 virgate and they supplied the\r\nsheriff with 9 pence a year or 2-1/4 _averae_ (carrying services).' No,\r\nwe have not been reading of the joint holders of a 'manor'; we have been\r\nreading of peasant proprietors. Two of them were substantial folk; each\r\nof the two held a _manerium_ at which geld was paid; the other seven\r\ngelded at one of the king's _maneria_ under the view of his bailiffs.\r\n_Maneria_ there have been everywhere; but 'manors' we see in the making.\r\nHardouin has made one under our eyes.\r\n\r\n[The small _maneria_.]\r\n\r\nWe hear the objection that, be it never so humble, a manor is a manor.\r\nBut is that truism quite true? If all that we want for the constitution\r\nof a manor is a proprietor of some land who has a right to exact from\r\nsome other man, or two or three other men, the whole or some part of the\r\nlabour that is necessary for the tillage of his soil, we may indeed see\r\nmanors everywhere and at all times. Even if we introduce a more\r\ncharacteristically medieval element and demand that the tillers shall be\r\nneither menial servants nor labourers hired for money, but men who make\r\ntheir living by cultivating for their own behoof small plots which the\r\nproprietor allows them to occupy, still we shall have the utmost\r\ndifficulty if we would go behind manorialism. But suppose for a moment\r\nthat we have a village the land of which is being held by nine sokemen,\r\neach of whom has a hide or half-hide scattered about in the open fields,\r\nand each of whom controls the labour of a couple of serfs, shall we not\r\nbe misleading the public and ourselves if we speak of nine manors or\r\neven of nine 'embryo manors'? At any rate it is clear enough that if\r\nthese estates of the sokemen are 'embryo manors,' then these embryos\r\nwere deposited in the common fields. In that case the common fields, the\r\nhides and yard-lands of the village are not the creatures of\r\nmanorialism.\r\n\r\n[The Danes and freedom.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen free villages; we have seen a free hundred. We might have\r\nfound yet freer hundreds had we gone to Suffolk. We have chosen\r\nCambridgeshire because Cambridgeshire can not be called a Danish county,\r\nexcept in a sense in which, notwithstanding the wasted condition of\r\nYorkshire, about one half of the English nation lived in Danish\r\ncounties. When men divide up England between the three laws, they place\r\nCambridgeshire under the Danelaw; but to that law they subject about one\r\nhalf of the inhabitants of England. There may have been many men of\r\nScandinavian race in Cambridgeshire; but we find hundreds not\r\nwapentakes, hides not carucates, while among the names of villages there\r\nare few indeed which betray a Scandinavian origin. The Wetherley hundred\r\nwas not many miles away from the classic fields of Hitchin[575].\r\n\r\n[The Danish counties.]\r\n\r\nBut in truth we must be careful how we use our Dane. Yorkshire was a\r\nDanish county in a sense in which Cambridgeshire was not Danish; it was\r\na land of trithings and wapentakes, a land without hides, where many a\r\nvillage testified by its name to a Scandinavian settlement. And yet to\r\nall appearance it was in the Confessor's day a land where the manors\r\nstood thick[576]. Then we have that wonderful contrast between Yorkshire\r\nand Lincolnshire which Ellis summed up in these figures:--\r\n\r\n                    Sochemanni      Villani       Bordarii\r\n     Lincolnshire     11,503         7,723         4,024\r\n     Yorkshire           447         5,079         1,819\r\n\r\nPerhaps this contrast would have been less violent if Yorkshire had not\r\nbeen devastated: but violent it is and must be. It will provoke the\r\nremark that the 'faults' (if any faults there be) in a truly economic\r\nstratification of mankind are not likely to occur just at the boundaries\r\nof the shires, whereas so long as each county has a court from which\r\nthere is no appeal to any central tribunal, we may expect to find that\r\nlines which have their origin in fiscal practice will be sharp lines and\r\nwill coincide with the metes and bounds of jurisdictional districts.\r\n\r\n[The contrast between villeins and sokemen.]\r\n\r\nNor should it escape remark that the names by which a grand distinction\r\nis expressed are in their origin very loose terms and etymologically\r\nill-fitted to the purpose that they are serving. In English the\r\n_villanus_ is the _túnesman_ or, as we should say, the villager. And yet\r\nto all seeming the sokeman is essentially a villager. What is more the\r\nland where the sokemen and 'free men' lived was a land of true villages,\r\nof big villages, of limitless 'open fields,' whereas the hamleted west\r\nwas servile. Then again _sokeman_ is a very odd term. If it signified\r\nthat the man to whom it is applied was always the justiciable of the\r\nlord to whom he was commended, we could understand it. Even if this man\r\nwere always the justiciable of a court that had passed into private\r\nhands, we could still understand it. But apparently there are plenty of\r\nsokemen whose soke 'is' or 'lies' in those hundred courts that have no\r\nlord but the king. The best guess that we can make as to the manner in\r\nwhich they have acquired their name is that in an age which is being\r\npersuaded that some 'service' must be done by every one who holds land,\r\nsuit of court appears as the only service that is done by all these men.\r\nThey may owe other services; but they all owe suit of court. If so we\r\nmay see their legal successors in those freeholders of the twelfth\r\ncentury who are 'acquitting' their lords and their villages by doing\r\nsuit at the national courts[577]. But when a new force comes into play\r\n(and the tribute to the pirate was a new and a powerful force) new lines\r\nof demarcation must be drawn, new classes of men must be formed and\r\nwords will be borrowed for the purpose with little care for\r\netymological niceties. One large and widely-spread class may find a name\r\nfor itself in a district where the ordinary 'townsmen' or villagers are\r\nno longer treated as taxpayers responsible to the state, while some\r\npractice peculiar to a small part of the country may confer the name of\r\n'sokemen' on those tillers of the soil who are rated to the geld. We are\r\nnot arguing that this distinction, even when it first emerged, implied\r\nnothing that concerned the economic position of the villein and the\r\nsokeman. The most dependent peasants would naturally be the people who\r\ncould not be directly charged with the geld, and the peasants who could\r\nnot pay the geld would naturally become dependent on those who would pay\r\nit for them; still we are not entitled to assume that the fiscal scheme\r\naccurately mirrored the economic facts, or that the varying practice of\r\ndifferent moots and different collectors may not have stamped as the\r\nvilleins of one shire those who would have been the sokemen of\r\nanother[578].\r\n\r\n[Free villages.]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, any theory of English history must face the free, the\r\nlordless, village and must account for it as for one of the normal\r\nphenomena which existed in the year of grace 1066. How common it was we\r\nshall never know until the material contained in Domesday Book has been\r\ngeographically rearranged by counties, hundreds and vills. But whether\r\ncommon or no, it was normal, just as normal as the village which was\r\ncompletely subject to seignorial power. We have before us villages\r\nwhich, taken as wholes, have no lords. What is more, it seems obvious\r\nenough that, unless there has been some great catastrophe in the past,\r\nsome insurrection of the peasants or the like, the village of\r\nOrwell--and other villages might be named by the dozen--has never had a\r\nlord. Such lordships as exist in it are plainly not the relics of a\r\ndominion which has been split up among divers persons by the action of\r\ngifts and inheritances. The sokemen of Orwell have worshipped every\r\nrising sun. One has commended himself to the ill-fated Harold, another\r\nto the ill-fated Waltheof, a third has chosen the Mercian Ælfgar, a\r\nfourth has placed himself under the aspiring Archbishop; yet all are\r\nfree to 'withdraw.' We have here a very free village indeed, for its\r\nmembers enjoy a freedom of which no freeholder of the thirteenth century\r\nwould even dream, and in a certain sense we have here a free village\r\ncommunity. How much communalism is there? Of this most difficult\r\nquestion only a few words will now be said, for our guesses about remote\r\nages we will yet a while reserve.\r\n\r\n[Village communities.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we can not doubt that the 'open field system' of\r\nagriculture prevails as well in the free villages as in those that are\r\nunder the control of a lord. The sokeman's hide or virgate is no\r\nring-fenced 'close' but is composed of many scattered strips. Again, we\r\ncan hardly doubt that the practice of 'co-aration' prevailed. The\r\nsokeman had seldom beasts enough to make up a team. It is well known\r\nthat the whole scheme of land-measurements which runs through Domesday\r\nBook is based upon the theory that land is ploughed by teams of eight\r\noxen. It is perhaps possible that smaller teams were sometimes employed;\r\nbut when we read that a certain man 'always ploughed with three\r\noxen[579],' or 'used to plough with two oxen but now ploughs with half a\r\nteam[580],' or 'used to plough with a team but now ploughs with two\r\noxen[581],' we are reading, not of small teams, but of the number of\r\noxen that the man in question contributed towards the team of eight that\r\nwas made up by him and his neighbours. When of a piece of land in\r\nBedfordshire it is said that 'one ox ploughs there,' this means that the\r\nland in question supplies but one ox in a team of eight[582]; and here\r\nand not in any monstrous birth do we find the explanation of 'terra est\r\ndimidio bovi et ibi est semibos[583]':--there is a sixteenth part of a\r\nteamland and its tenant along with some other man provides an ox. There\r\nmay have been light ploughs as well as heavy ploughs, but the heavy\r\nplough must have been extremely common, since the term 'plough team'\r\n(_caruca_) seems invariably to mean a team of eight.\r\n\r\n[The villagers as co-owners.]\r\n\r\nThen one notable case meets our eye in which the ownership of land, of\r\narable land, seems to be attributed to a village community. In\r\nGoldington, a village in Bedfordshire, Walter now holds a hide; there is\r\nland for one team and meadow for half a team. 'The men of the vill held\r\nthis land in common and could sell it[584].' Apparently the men of the\r\nvill were Ælfwin Sac a man of the Bishop of Lincoln who held half a\r\nteam-land and 'could do what he liked with it,' nine sokemen who held\r\nthree team-lands between them, three other sokemen who held three\r\nteam-lands, and Ælfmær a man of Asgil who held three team-lands[585].\r\nHow it came about that these men, besides holding land in severalty,\r\nheld a tract in common, we are left to guess. Nor can we say whether\r\nsuch a case was usual or unusual. Very often in Little Domesday we meet\r\nan entry which tells how _x_ free men held _y_ acres and had _z_ teams;\r\nfor example, how 15 free men held 40 acres and had 2 teams[586]. In\r\ngeneral we may well suppose that each of them held his strips in\r\nseveralty, but we dare not say that such a phrase never points to\r\nco-ownership.\r\n\r\n[The waste land of the vill.]\r\n\r\nThen as to such part of the land as is not arable:--Even in the free\r\nvillage a few enclosed meadows will probably be found; but the pasture\r\nground lies open for 'the cattle of the vill.' At the date of the\r\nsurvey, though several Norman lords have estates in one vill, the common\r\nformula used in connexion with each estate is, not 'there is pasture for\r\nthe cattle of this manor, or of this land,' but 'there is pasture for\r\nthe cattle of the vill.' Occasionally we read of 'common pasture' in a\r\ncontext which shows that the pasture is common not to several manorial\r\nlords but to the villeins of one lord[587]. In the hundred of Coleness\r\nin Suffolk there is a pasture which is common to all the men of the\r\nhundred[588]. But, as might be expected, we hear little of the mode in\r\nwhich pasture rights were allotted or regulated. Such rights were\r\nprobably treated as appurtenances of the arable land:--'The canons of\r\nWaltham claim as much wood as belongs to one hide[589].' If the rights\r\nof user are known, no one cares about the bare ownership of pasture land\r\nor wood land:--it is all one whether we say that Earl Edwin is entitled\r\nto one third of a certain wood or to every third oak that grows\r\ntherein[590].\r\n\r\n[Co-ownership of mills.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the ownership of a mill is divided into so many shares that we\r\nare tempted to think that this mill has been erected at the cost of the\r\nvill. In Suffolk a free man holds a little _manerium_ which is composed\r\nof 24 acres of land, 1-1/2 acres of meadow and 'a fourth part of the\r\nmill in every third year[591]':--he takes his turn with his neighbours\r\nin the enjoyment of the revenue of the mill. We may even be led to\r\nsuspect that the parish churches have sometimes been treated as\r\nbelonging to the men of the vill who have subscribed to erect or to\r\nendow them. In Suffolk a twelfth part of a church belongs to a petty\r\n_manerium_ which contains 30 acres and is cultivated by two bordiers\r\nwith a single team[592]. When a parish church gets its virgate by 'the\r\ncharity of the neighbours[593],' when nine free men give it twenty acres\r\nfor the good of their souls[594], we may see in this some trace of\r\ncommunal action.\r\n\r\n[The system of virgates in a free village.]\r\n\r\nIncidentally we may notice that the system of virgate holdings seems\r\nquite compatible with an absence of seignorial control. In the free\r\nvillage, for example in Orwell, we shall often find that one man has\r\ntwice, thrice or four times as much as another man:--the same is the\r\ncase in the manorialized villages of Middlesex, where a villein may have\r\nas much as a hide or as little as a half-virgate; but all the holdings\r\nwill bear, at least in theory, some simple relation to each other. Thus\r\nin Orwell the virgates are divided into thirds and quarters, and in\r\nseveral instances a man has four thirds of a virgate. In Essex and East\r\nAnglia, though we may find many irregular and many very small holdings,\r\ntenements of 60, 45, 40, 30, 20, 15 acres are far commoner than they\r\nwould be were it not that a unit of 120 acres will very easily break\r\ninto such pieces. Domesday Book takes no notice of family law and its\r\n'vendere potuit' merely excludes the interference of the lord and does\r\nnot imply that a man is at liberty to disappoint his expectant heirs.\r\nVery possibly there has been among the small folk but little giving or\r\nselling of land.\r\n\r\n[The virgates and inheritance.]\r\n\r\nNor is a law which gives the dead man's land to all his sons as co-heirs\r\na sufficient force to destroy the system of hides and virgates when once\r\nit is established by some original allotment. In the higher ranks of\r\nsociety we see large groups of thegns holding land in common, holding as\r\nthe Normans say 'in parage.' We can hardly doubt that they are co-heirs\r\nholding an inheritance that has not been physically partitioned[595].\r\nSometimes it is said of a single man that he holds in parage[596]. This\r\ngives us a valuable hint. Holding in parage implies that one of the\r\n'pares,' one of the parceners,--as a general rule he would be the eldest\r\nof them--is answerable to king and lord for the services due from the\r\nland, while his fellows are bound only to him; they must help him to\r\ndischarge duties for which he is primarily responsible[597]. This seems\r\nthe import of such passages as the following--'Five thegns held two\r\nbovates; one of them was the _senior_ (the elder, and we may almost\r\nsay the lord) of the others[598]'--'Eight thegns held this manor;\r\none of them Alli, a man of King Edward, was the _senior_ of the\r\nothers[599]'--'Godric and his brothers held three carucates; two of\r\nthem served the third[600]'--'Chetel and Turver were brothers and\r\nafter the death of their father they divided the land, but so that\r\nChetel in doing the king's service should have help from Turver his\r\nbrother[601]'--'Siwate, Alnod, Fenchel and Aschil divided the land of\r\ntheir father equally, and they held in such wise that if there were need\r\nfor attendance in the king's host and Siwate could go, his brothers were\r\nto aid him [with money and provisions]; and on the next occasion another\r\nbrother was to go and Siwate like the rest was to help him; and so on\r\ndown the list; but Siwate was the king's man[602].' No doubt similar\r\narrangements were made by co-heirs of lowlier station[603]. The\r\nintegrity of the tenement is maintained though several men have an\r\ninterest in it. In relation to the lord and the state one of them\r\nrepresents his fellows. When the shares become very small, some of the\r\nclaimants might be bought out by the others[604].\r\n\r\n[The farm.]\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the village, we must once more notice that the Canons\r\nof St Paul's have let their manor of Willesden to the villeins[605].\r\nThis leads us to speculate as to the incidence and collection of those\r\ngreat provender rents of which we read when royal manors are described.\r\nIn King Edward's day a royal manor is often charged with the whole or\r\nsome aliquot share of a 'one night's farm,' that is one day's victual\r\nfor the king's household. Definite amounts of bread, cheese, malt, meat,\r\nbeer, honey, wool have to be supplied; thus, for example, Cheltenham\r\nmust furnish three thousand loaves for the king's dogs and King's Barton\r\nmust do the like[606]. Then too Edward the sheriff receives as the\r\nprofits of the shrievalty of Wiltshire, 130 pigs, 32 bacons, certain\r\nquantities of wheat, malt, oats, and honey, 400 chicken, 1600 eggs, 100\r\ncheeses, 100 lambs, 52 fleeces[607]. Between the king and the men of the\r\nmanor, no doubt there stands a farmer, either the sheriff or some other\r\nperson, who is bound to supply the due quantity of provender; but to say\r\nthat this is so does not solve the problem that is before us. We have\r\nstill to ask how this due quantity is obtained from the men of the\r\nvillage. It is a quantity which can be expressed by round figures; it is\r\n3000 dog-cakes, or the like. We do not arrive at these pretty results by\r\nadding up the rents due from individuals. Again, just in the counties\r\nwhich are the homes of freedom we hear much of sums of money that are\r\npaid to a lord by way of free will offering[608]. In Norfolk and Suffolk\r\nthe villagers will give a yearly _gersuma_, in Lincoln they will pay a\r\nyearly _tailla_, and this will be a neat round sum; very often it is 20\r\nshillings, or 40 or 10.\r\n\r\n[Round sums raised from the villages.]\r\n\r\nIn this particular we seem to see an increase of something that may be\r\ncalled communalism, as we go backwards. Of course in the cartularies of\r\na later age we may discover round sums of money which, under the names\r\nof 'tallage' or 'aid' are imposed upon the vill as a whole; but in\r\ngeneral we may accept the rule that tributes to be paid by the vill as a\r\nwhole, in money or in kind, are not of recent origin. They are more\r\nprominent in the oldest than in other documents. As examples, we may\r\nnotice the 'cornage' of the Boldon Book--one vill renders 20 shillings,\r\nanother 30 shillings for cornage[609]; also the contributions of sheep,\r\npoultry, bread and cloth which the vills of Peterborough Abbey bring to\r\nthe monks on the festival of their patron saint--one vill supplying ten\r\nrams and twenty ells of cloth, another four rams, five ells of cloth,\r\nten chicken and three hundred loaves[610]. But then we have to notice\r\nthat a village which has to pay a provender rent or even a _tailla_ or\r\n_gersuma_ is not altogether a free village. Its communal action is\r\ncalled out by seignorial pressure.\r\n\r\n[The township and police law.]\r\n\r\nAnd as we go backwards the township seems to lose such definiteness as\r\nis given to it by the police law of the thirteenth century[611]. This\r\nwas to be expected, for such law implies a powerful, centralized state,\r\nwhich sends its justices round the country to amerce the townships and\r\ncompel these local communities to do their duties. Once and once only\r\ndoes the township appear in the Anglo-Saxon dooms. This is in a law of\r\nEdgar. If a man who is on a journey buys cattle, then on his return home\r\nhe must turn them onto the common pasture, 'with the witness of the\r\ntownship.' If he fails to do so, then after five nights the townsmen are\r\nto give information to the elder of the hundred, and in that case they\r\nand their cattle-herd will be free of blame, and the man who brought the\r\ncattle into the town will forfeit them, half to the lord and half to\r\nthe hundred. If, on the other hand, the townsmen fail in the duty of\r\ngiving information, their herd will pay for it with his skin[612]. The\r\ntownship has very little organization of which the state can make use.\r\nIt does not seem even to have an 'elder' or head-man, and, from the\r\nthreat of a flogging, we may gather that its common herdsman will be a\r\nslave. Purchases of cattle can not be made 'with the witness of the\r\ntownship'; the purchaser ought to seek out two or three of those twelve\r\nstanding witnesses who are appointed for every hundred[613]. So again,\r\nin the twelfth century we see the finder of a stray beast bringing it\r\ninto the vill; he conducts it to the church-door and tells his story to\r\nthe priest, the reeve and as many of the best men of the vill as can be\r\ngot together. Then the reeve sends to the four neighbouring vills, calls\r\nin from each the priest, the reeve and three or four men and recounts\r\nthe tale in their presence. Then on the following day he goes to the\r\nhead-man of the hundred and puts the whole matter before him and\r\ndelivers up the beast to him, unless indeed the place where it was found\r\nstraying was within the domain of some lord who had sake and soke[614].\r\nHere again, the organization of the township appears to be of a most\r\nrudimentary kind. It has no court, unless its lord has sake and soke; it\r\nhas no power to detain an estray for safe custody. In this very simple\r\ncase it requires the help of other vills and must transmit the cause to\r\nthe hundred court. And so again, though there may be some reason for\r\nthinking that at one time the murder fine--the fine payable if the\r\nslayer of a foreigner was not arrested--was primarily exigible from the\r\nvill in which the corpse was found, the hundred being but subsidiarily\r\nliable, still this rule seems to have been soon abandoned and the burden\r\nof the fine, a fine far too heavy for a single vill, was cast upon the\r\nhundred[615]. For all this, however, the law knew and made use of the\r\ntownship. The Domesday commissioners required the testimony of the\r\npriest, the reeve and six _villani_ of every vill. So soon as the law\r\nabout suit to the hundred court becomes at all plain, the suit is due\r\nrather from vills than from men, and the burden is discharged by the\r\nlord of the vill or his steward, or, if neither of them can attend,\r\nthen by the priest, the reeve and four of the vill's best men[616].\r\n\r\n[The free village and Norman government.]\r\n\r\nHow could these requirements be met by a vill which had no lord? It\r\nwould be a fair remark that the existence of such vills is not\r\ncontemplated by the Norman rulers. The men who will represent the vill\r\nbefore the Domesday commissioners will in their eyes be _villani_. This\r\nassumption is becoming true enough. We have seen Orwell full of sokemen;\r\nin 1086 there is never a sokeman in it; there is no one in it who is\r\nabove the rank of a villein. Count Roger and Walter Giffard, Count Alan\r\nand Geoffrey de Mandeville can make such arrangements about the suit of\r\nOrwell, the reeveship of Orwell, as they think fit. Everywhere the\r\nFrenchmen are consolidating their manors, creating demesne land where\r\ntheir English _antecessores_ had none, devising scientific frontiers,\r\ndoing what in them lies to make every vill a manor. Thus is evolved that\r\nstate of things which comes before us in the thirteenth century. The\r\nwork of the foreigners was done so completely that we can see but very\r\nlittle of the institutions that they swept away.\r\n\r\n[Organization of the free village.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, we shall do well not to endow the free township\r\nof the Confessor's day with much organization. We may be certain that,\r\nat least as a general rule, it had no court; we may doubt very gravely\r\nwhether it always had any elder, head-man, or reeve. Often it was a\r\nsmall and yet a heterogeneous, and a politically distracted body. Some\r\nof its members might be attached to the house of Godwin, some had sworn\r\nto live and die for the house of Leofric. Just because it is free it has\r\nfew, if any, communal payments to make. Only if it comes under a single\r\nlord will it have to render a provender rent, a _tailla_ or _gersuma_.\r\nAs a sphere for communal action there remains only the regulation of the\r\narable lands, the woods and waste. We can not say for certain that these\r\ngive scope for much regulation. The arable strips are held in severalty;\r\nif by chance some of them are held in common, this in all probability is\r\na case rather of co-ownership than of communal ownership. The pasture\r\nrights may well be regarded as appurtenances of the arable strips. The\r\npractice of 'co-aration' need not be enforced by law; the man who will\r\nnot help his neighbours must be content to see his own land unploughed.\r\nThe course of agriculture is fixed and will not be often or easily\r\naltered. The 'realism' which roots every right and duty in a definite\r\npatch of soil, the rapid conversion of new arrangements into immemorial\r\ncustoms, the practice of taking turn and turn about, the practice of\r\ncasting lots, these will do much towards settling questions such as our\r\nmodern imaginations would solve by means of a village council. No doubt,\r\nfrom time to time a new departure is made; new land is reclaimed from\r\nthe waste, perhaps the pasture rights are stinted or redistributed, a\r\nmill is built or a church is endowed;--but all this requires no periodic\r\nassemblies, no organization that we dare call either permanent or legal.\r\nOnce in five years or so there may be something to be done, and done it\r\nwill be by a resolution of the villagers which is or calls itself an\r\nunanimous resolution. If the Cambridgeshire townships had been\r\nlandowning corporations, each of them would have passed as a single unit\r\ninto the hands of some Norman baron. But this did not happen. On the\r\ncontrary, the Norman barons had to content themselves with intermixed\r\nstrips; the strips of Ælfgar's men went to Count Roger, the strips of\r\nEdith's men went to Count Alan. We are far from denying the existence of\r\na communal sentiment, of a notion that somehow or another the men of the\r\nvill taken as a whole owned the lands of the vill, but this sentiment,\r\nthis notion, if strong was vague. There were no institutions in which it\r\ncould realize itself, there was no form of speech or thought in which it\r\ncould find an apt expression. It evaded the grasp of law. At the touch\r\nof jurisprudence the township became a mere group of individuals, each\r\nwith his separate rights[617].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [547] D.

Nor, it is to be hoped, will\r\n        etymological guesses lead him to believe that the compound\r\n        householder held a compound house. He will say that a landlord\r\n        'compounded for' the rates of the aforesaid householder.\r\n        _Mutatis mutandis_ may not the villein have been the compound\r\n        householder of the eleventh century?\r\n\r\n  [579] D.

Henr. 7 § 7.\r\n\r\n  [617] It is possible that the entry (i. 204) which tells how the\r\n        sokemen of Broughton enjoyed the smaller _wites_ points to a\r\n        free village court; but we have put another interpretation\r\n        upon this; see above, p. 99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _The Feudal Superstructure._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The higher ranks of men.]\r\n\r\nIt remains that we should speak very briefly of the higher ranks of men\r\nand the tenure by which they held their land. Little accurate\r\ninformation can be extorted from our record. The upper storeys of the\r\nold English edifice have been demolished and a new superstructure has\r\nbeen reared in their stead. It is not the office of Domesday Book to\r\ntell us much even of the new nobility, of the services which the counts\r\nand barons are to render to the king in return for their handsome\r\nendowments:--as to the old nobility, that has perished. Still there are\r\nsome questions that we ought to ask.\r\n\r\n[Dependent tenure.]\r\n\r\nThe general theory that all land tenure, except indeed the tenure by\r\nwhich the king holds land in demesne, is dependent tenure, seems to be\r\nimplied, not only by many particular entries, but also by the whole\r\nscheme of the book. Every holder of land, except the king, holds it of\r\n(_de_) some lord, and therefore every acre of land that is not royal\r\ndemesne can be arranged under the name of some tenant in chief. Even a\r\nchurch will hold its land, if not of the king, then of some other\r\nlord[618]. The terms of the tenure are but very rarely described, for\r\nDomesday Book is no feodary. Just now and again a tenure _in elemosina_\r\nis noticed and in some of these cases this term seems already to bear\r\nthe technical sense that it will have in later days; the tenant owes a\r\nspiritual, but no secular service[619]. A few instances of what later\r\nlawyers would call a 'tenure by divine service,' as distinct from a\r\ntenure in frank-almoin, may be found[620]. A few words here and there\r\nbetray the existence of tenure by knight's service and of castle\r\nguard[621]. In the _servientes Regis_ who have been enfeoffed in divers\r\ncounties we may see the predecessors of the tenants by serjeanty[622].\r\nWe shall remark, however, the absence of those abstract terms which are\r\nto become the names of the various tenures. We read of _servientes_,\r\n_sochemanni_, _villani_, _burgenses_, but not of _seriantia_[623],\r\n_socagium_, _villenagium_, _burgagium_. As we pursue our retrogressive\r\ncourse through the middle ages, we do not find that the law of personal\r\ncondition becomes more and more distinct from the law of land tenure; on\r\nthe contrary, the two become less and less separable.\r\n\r\n[_Feudum._]\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that a feudal tenure was the only kind of\r\nland tenure that the Norman conquerors could conceive. In a certain\r\nsense this may be true, but we should have preferred to say that\r\nprobably they could not easily conceive a kind of tenure that was not\r\ndependent:--every one who holds land (except he be the king) holds it of\r\nsomeone else. The adjective 'feudal' was not in their vocabulary, and\r\ntheir use of the word _feudum_--occasionally we meet the older\r\n_feum_[624]--is exceedingly obscure. Very rarely does it denote a tenure\r\nor a mass of rights; usually, though it may connote rights of a certain\r\norder, it denotes a stretch of land; thus we may read of the fee of the\r\nBishop of Bayeux, thereby being meant the territory which the bishop\r\nholds. Occasionally, however, we hear of a man holding land _in feudo_.\r\nOne instance may be enough to show that such a phrase did not imply\r\nmilitary tenure:--'William the Chamberlain held this manor _in feudo_ of\r\nthe Queen [Matilda] at a rent of £3 a year and after her death he held\r\nit in the same fashion of the king[625].' All sense of militariness, and\r\nall sense of precariousness, that the word has ever had in its\r\ncontinental history, seems to be disappearing. Already the process has\r\nbegun which will make it applicable to every person who has heritable\r\nrights in land. William the Chamberlain is, we take it, already a fee\r\nfarmer, that is, a rent-paying tenant with heritable rights[626]. As to\r\nthe word _beneficium_, which _feum_ or _feudum_ has been supplanting, we\r\nshall hardly find it with its old meaning. It seems to be holding its\r\nown only within the sphere of ecclesiastical rights, where the\r\n'benefice' will survive until our own day[627].\r\n\r\n[_Alodium._]\r\n\r\nA yet more interesting and equally foreign word is not unfrequently\r\nused, namely, _alodium_. The Norman commissioners deemed that a large\r\nnumber of English tenants in Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire and some\r\nin Berkshire had been _alodiarii_ or _aloarii_ and had held _in alodium_\r\nor _sicut alodium_. The appearance of this term in one district and in\r\none only is far from proving that there had been anything peculiar in\r\nthe law of that district. It may well be a mere chance that the _liberi\r\nhomines_ of other counties are not called _alodiaries_. Still in\r\nHampshire, where alodiaries abounded, it was not every free man holding\r\nland who had an _alod_[628]. Perhaps we shall be right in thinking that\r\nthe term pointed to heritability:--the free man who holds land but has\r\nno _alod_ has only an estate for life. Certainly it does not mean that\r\nthe tenant has no lord. The alodiary may hold his alod 'of' his\r\nlord[629]; he may owe service to his lord[630]; he may pay a\r\nrelief[631]; he may have no power 'to withdraw himself with his land'\r\nfrom his lord[632]. The Norman lawyers had no speculative objection to\r\nthe existence of alodiaries; it in no way contradicted such doctrine of\r\ntenure as they had formed. In 1086 there were still alodiaries in\r\nBerkshire[633], and in royal charters of a much later day there is talk\r\nof the alodiaries of Kent as of an existing class[634]. It is just\r\npossible that William's commissioners saw some difference between\r\nholding _in feudo_ and holding _in alodio_. If ever they contrasted the\r\ntwo words, they may have hinted that while the _feudum_ has been given\r\nby the lord to the man, the _alodium_ has been brought by the man to the\r\nlord; but we can not be very certain that they ever opposed these terms\r\nto each other[635]. Such sparse evidence as we can obtain from Normandy\r\nstrengthens our belief that the wide, the almost insuperable, gulf that\r\nmodern theorists have found or have set between 'alodial ownership' and\r\n'feudal tenure' was not perceptible in the eleventh century[636]. It can\r\nbe no part of our task to trace the history of these terms _alodium_ and\r\n_feudum_ behind the date at which they are brought into England, but\r\nhereafter we shall see that here in England a process had been at work\r\nwhich, had these terms been in use, would have brought the alod very\r\nnear to the feud, the feud very near to the alod.\r\n\r\n[Application of the formula of dependent tenure.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this process had gone somewhat further in Normandy\r\nthan in England. It is probable that the Normans knew that in imposing\r\nupon all English lands 'the formula of dependent tenure' they were\r\nsimplifying matters. They seem to think, and they may be pretty right in\r\nthinking, that every English land-holder had held his land under (_sub_)\r\nsome lord; but apparently they do not think that every English\r\nland-holder had held his land of (_de_) some lord. Not unfrequently they\r\nshow that this is so. Thus one Sigar holds a piece of Cambridgeshire\r\n_of_ Geoffrey de Mandeville; he used to hold it _under_ Æsgar the\r\nStaller[637]. We catch a slight shade of difference between the two\r\nprepositions; _sub_ lays stress on the lord's power, which may well be\r\nof a personal or justiciary, rather than of a proprietary kind, while\r\n_de_ imports a theory about the origin of the tenure; it makes the\r\ntenant's rights look like derivative rights:--it is supposed that he\r\ngets his land from his lord. And at least in the eastern counties--so\r\nit may well have seemed to the Normans--matters sadly needed\r\nsimplification. Even elsewhere and when a large estate is at stake they\r\ncan not always get an answer to the question 'Of whom was this land\r\nholden[638]?' Still they thought that some of the greatest men in the\r\nrealm had held their lands, or some of their lands, of the king or of\r\nsomeone else. The formulas which are used throughout the description of\r\nHampshire and some other counties seem to assume that every holder of a\r\nmanor, at all events if a layman, had held it _of_ the king, if he did\r\nnot hold it _of_ another lord. Tenure _in feudo_ again they regarded as\r\nno innovation[639]. They saw the work of subinfeudation:--Brihtmær held\r\nland of Azor and Azor of Harold; we may well suppose that Harold held it\r\n_of_ the king and that some villeins held part of it of Brihtmær, and\r\nthus we see already a feudal ladder with no less than five rungs[640].\r\nThey saw that the thegns owed 'service' to their lords[641]. They saw\r\nthe heriot; they sometimes called it a relief[642]. We can not be sure\r\nthat this change of names imported any change in the law; when a burgess\r\nof Hereford died the king took a heriot, but if he could not get the\r\nheriot he took the dead man's land[643]. They saw that in certain cases\r\nan heir had to 'seek' his ancestor's lord if he wished to enjoy his\r\nancestor's land[644]. They saw that many a free man could not give or\r\nsell his land without his lord's consent. They saw that great and\r\npowerful men could not give or sell their land without the king's\r\nconsent[645].\r\n\r\n[Military tenure.]\r\n\r\nThey saw something very like military tenure. No matter with which we\r\nhave to deal is darker than the constitution of the English army on the\r\neve of its defeat. We may indeed safely believe that no English king had\r\never relinquished the right to call upon all the free men of his realm\r\nto resist an invader. On the other hand, it seems quite clear that, as a\r\nmatter of fact, 'the host' was no longer 'the nation in arms.' The\r\ncommon folk of a shire could hardly be got to fight outside their shire,\r\nand ill-armed troops of peasants were now of little avail. The only army\r\nupon which the king could habitually rely was a small force. The city of\r\nOxford sent but twenty men or twenty pounds[646]: Leicester sent twelve\r\nmen[647]: Warwick sent ten[648]. In Berkshire the law was that, if the\r\nking called out the host, one soldier (_miles_) should go for every five\r\nhides and should receive from each hide four shillings as his stipend\r\nfor two months' service. If the man who was summoned made default, he\r\nforfeited all his land to the king; but there were cases in which he\r\nmight send one of his men as a substitute, and for a default committed\r\nby his substitute he suffered no forfeiture, but only a fine of fifty\r\nshillings[649]. It is probable that a similar 'five hide rule' obtained\r\nthroughout a large part of England. The borough of Wilton was bound to\r\nsend twenty shillings or one man 'as for an honour of five hides[650].'\r\nWhen an army or a fleet was called out, Exeter 'served to the amount of\r\nfive hides[651].' All this points to a small force of well armed\r\nsoldiers. For example, 'the five hide rule' would be satisfied if\r\nWorcestershire sent a contingent of 240 men. But not only was the army\r\nsmall; it was a territorial army; it grew out of the soil.\r\n\r\n[The army and the land.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight this 'five hide rule' may seem to have in it little that\r\nis akin to a feudal system of knights' fees. We may suppose that it will\r\nwork thus:--The host is summoned; the number of hides in each hundred is\r\nknown. To despatch a company of soldiers proportioned to the number of\r\nthe hides, for example twenty warriors if the hundred contains just one\r\nhundred hides, is the business of the hundred court and the question\r\n'Who must go?' will be answered by election, rotation or lot. But it is\r\nnot probable that the territorializing process will stop here, and this\r\nfor several reasons. An army that can not be mobilized without the\r\naction of the hundred moots is not a handy force. While the hundredors\r\nare deliberating the Danes or Welshmen will be burning and slaying. Also\r\na king will not easily be content with the responsibility of a\r\nfluctuating and indeterminate body of hundredors; he will insist, if he\r\ncan, that there must be some one person answerable to him for each unit\r\nof military power. A serviceable system will not have been established\r\nuntil the country is divided into 'five-hide-units,' until every man's\r\nholding is such an unit, or is composed of several such units, or is an\r\naliquot share of such an unit. Then again the holdings with which the\r\nrule will have to deal are not homogeneous; they are not all of one and\r\nthe same order. It is not as though to each plot of land there\r\ncorresponded some one person who was the only person interested in it;\r\nthe occupiers of the soil have lords and again those lords have lords.\r\nThe king will insist, if he can, that the lords who stand high in this\r\nscale must answer to him for the service that is due from all the lands\r\nover which they exercise a dominion, and then he will leave them free to\r\nsettle, as between themselves and their dependants, the ultimate\r\nincidence of the burden:--thus room will be made for the play of free\r\ncontract. At all events when, as is not unusual, some lord is the lord\r\nof a whole hundred and of its court, the king will regard him as\r\npersonally liable for the production of the whole contingent that is due\r\nfrom that hundred. In this way a system will be evolved which for many\r\npractical purposes will be indistinguishable from the system of knights'\r\nfees, and all this without any help from the definitely feudal idea\r\nthat military service is the return which the tenant makes to the lord\r\nfor the gift of land that the lord has made to the tenant.\r\n\r\n[Feudalism and army service.]\r\n\r\nThat this process had already done much of its work when the old English\r\narmy received its last summons, we can not doubt, though it is very\r\npossible that this work had been done sporadically. We see that the land\r\nwas being plotted out into five-hide-units. In one passage the Norman\r\nclerks call such a unit an honour, an 'honour of five hides[652].' There\r\nis an old theory based upon legal texts that such an honour qualifies\r\nits lord or owner to be a thegn. If a ceorl prospers so that he has five\r\nhides 'to the king's útware,' that is, an estate rated as five hides for\r\nmilitary purposes, he is worthy of a thegn's wergild[653]. Then the\r\nAnglo-Saxon charters show us how the kings have been endowing their\r\nthegns with tracts of territory which are deemed to contain just five or\r\nsome multiple of five hides[654]. The thegn with five hides will have\r\ntenants below him; but none of them need serve in the host if their lord\r\ngoes, as he ought to go, in person. Then each of these territorial units\r\ncontinues to owe the same quantum of military service, though the number\r\nof persons interested in it be increased or diminished, and thus the\r\nultimate incidence of the duty becomes the subject-matter of private\r\narrangements. That is the point of a story from Lincolnshire which we\r\nhave already recounted:--A man's land descends to his four sons; they\r\ndivide it equally and agree to take turns in doing the military service\r\nthat is due from it; but only the eldest of them is to be the king's\r\nman[655]. Then we see that the great nobles lead or send to the war all\r\nthe _milites_ that are due from the lands over which they have a\r\nseignory. There are already wide lands which owe military service--we\r\ncan not put it otherwise--to the bishop of Winchester as lord of\r\nTaunton:--they owe 'attendance in the host along with the men of the\r\nbishop[656].' The churches of Worcester and Evesham fell out about\r\ncertain lands at Hamton; one of the disputed questions was whether or\r\nno Hamton ought to do its military service 'in the bishop's hundred of\r\nOswaldslaw' or elsewhere[657]. This question we take to be one of great\r\nimportance to the bishop. Lord of the triple hundred of Oswaldslaw, lord\r\nof three hundred hides, he is bound to put sixty warriors into the field\r\nand he is anxious that men who ought to be helping him to make up this\r\ntale shall not be serving in another contingent.\r\n\r\n[Default of service.]\r\n\r\nBut from Worcestershire we obtain a still more precious piece of\r\ninformation. The custom of that county is this:--When the king summons\r\nthe host and his summons is disregarded by one who is a lord with\r\njurisdiction, 'by one who is so free a man that he has sake and soke and\r\ncan go with his land where he pleases,' then all his lands are in the\r\nking's mercy. But if the defaulter be the man of another lord and the\r\nlord sends a substitute in his stead, then he, the defaulter, must pay\r\nforty shillings to his lord,--to his lord, not to the king, for the king\r\nhas had the service that was due; but if the lord does not send a\r\nsubstitute, then the forty shillings which the defaulter pays to the\r\nlord, the lord must pay to the king[658]. A feudalist of the straiter\r\nsort might well find fault with this rule. He might object that the lord\r\nought to forfeit his land, not only if he himself fails to attend the\r\nhost, but also if he fails to bring with him his due tale of _milites_.\r\nFeudalism was not perfected in a day. Still here we have the root of the\r\nmatter--the lord is bound to bring into the field a certain number of\r\n_milites_, perhaps one man from every five hides, and if he can not\r\nbring those who are bound to follow him, he must bring others or pay a\r\nfine. His man, on the other hand, is bound to him and is not bound to\r\nthe king. That man by shirking his duty will commit no offence against\r\nthe king. The king is ceasing to care about the ultimate incidence of\r\nthe military burden, because he relies upon the responsibility of the\r\nmagnates. How this system worked in the eastern counties where the power\r\nof the magnates was feebler, we can not tell. It is not improbable that\r\none of the forces that is attaching the small free proprietors to the\r\nmanors of their lords is this 'five hide rule'; they are being compelled\r\nto bring their acres into five-hide-units, to club together under the\r\nsuperintendence of a lord who will answer for them to the king, while as\r\nto the villeins, so seldom have they fought that they are ceasing to be\r\n'fyrd-worthy[659].' But in the west we have already what in substance\r\nare knights' fees. The Bishop of Worcester held 300 hides over which he\r\nhad sake and soke and all customs; he was bound to put 60 _milites_ into\r\nthe field; if he failed in this duty he had to pay 40 shillings for each\r\ndeficient _miles_. At the beginning of Henry II.'s reign he was charged\r\nwith 60 knights' fees[660].\r\n\r\n[The new military service.]\r\n\r\nWe are not doubting that the Conqueror defined the amount of military\r\nservice that was to be due to him from each of his tenants in chief, nor\r\nare we suggesting that he paid respect to the rule about the five hides,\r\nbut it seems questionable whether he introduced any very new principle.\r\nA new theoretic element may come to the front, a contractual\r\nelement:--the tenant in chief must bring up his knights because that is\r\nthe service that was stipulated for when he received his land. But we\r\ncannot say that even this theory was unfamiliar to the English. The\r\nrulers of the churches had been giving or 'loaning' lands to thegns. In\r\nso doing they had not been dissipating the wealth of the saints without\r\nreceiving some 'valuable consideration' for the gift or the loan\r\n(_lǽn_); they looked to their thegns for the military service that\r\ntheir land owed to the king. To this point we must return in our next\r\nessay; but quite apart from definitely feudal bargains between the king\r\nand his magnates, between the magnates and their dependants, a\r\ndefinition of the duty of military service which connects it with the\r\nownership of land (and to such a definition men will come so soon as the\r\nwell-armed few can defeat the ill-armed many) will naturally produce a\r\nstate of things which will be patient of, even if it will not engender,\r\na purely feudal explanation. If one of the men to whom the Bishop of\r\nWorcester looks for military service makes a default, the fine that is\r\ndue from him will go to the bishop, not to the king. Why so? One\r\nexplanation will be that the bishop has over him a sake and soke of the\r\nvery highest order, which comprehends even that _fyrd-wíte_, that fine\r\nfor the neglect of military duty, which is one of the usually reserved\r\npleas of the crown[661]. Another explanation will be that this man has\r\nbroken a contract that he made with the bishop and therefore owes amends\r\nto the bishop:--to the bishop, not to the king, who was no party to the\r\ncontract. Sometimes the one explanation will be the truer, sometimes the\r\nother. Sometimes both will be true enough. As a matter of fact, we\r\nbelieve that these men of the Bishop of Worcester or their predecessors\r\nin title have solemnly promised to do whatever service the king demands\r\nfrom the bishop[662]. Still we can hardly doubt which of the two\r\nexplanations is the older, and, if we attribute to the Norman invaders,\r\nas perhaps we may, a definite apprehension of the theory that knight's\r\nservice is the outcome of feudal compacts, this still leaves open the\r\ninquiry whether the past history of military service in Frankland had\r\nnot been very like the past history of military service in England.\r\nAlready in the days of Charles the Great the duty of fighting the\r\nEmperor's battles was being bound up with the tenure of land by the\r\noperation of a rule very similar to that of which we have been speaking.\r\nThe owner of three (at a later time of four) manses was to serve; men\r\nwho held but a manse apiece were to group themselves together to supply\r\nsoldiers. Then at a later time the feudal theory of free contract was\r\nbrought in to explain an already existing state of things[663].\r\n\r\n[The thegns.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this matter is another thorny topic, namely, the\r\nstatus of the thegn and the relation of the thegn to his lord. In the\r\nConfessor's day many _maneria_ had been held by thegns; some of them\r\nwere still holding their lands when the survey was made and were still\r\ncalled thegns. The king's thegns were numerous, but the queen also had\r\nthegns, the earls had thegns, the churches had thegns and we find thegns\r\nascribed to men who were neither earls nor prelates but themselves were\r\nthegns[664]. Many of the king's thegns were able to give or sell the\r\nlands that they held, 'to go to whatever lord they pleased[665].' On the\r\nother hand, many of the thegns of the churches held lands which they\r\ncould not 'withdraw' from the churches[666]; in other words 'the\r\nthegn-lands' of the church could not be separated from the church[667].\r\nThe Conqueror respected the bond that tied them to the church. The Abbot\r\nof Ely complained to him that the foreigners had been abstracting the\r\nlands of St. Etheldreda. His answer was that her demesne manors must at\r\nonce be given back to her, while as for the men who have occupied her\r\nthegnlands, they must either make their peace with the abbot or\r\nsurrender their holdings[668]. Thus the abbot seems to have had the\r\nbenefit of that forfeiture which his thegns incurred by espousing the\r\ncause of Harold. We see therefore that the relation between thegn, lord\r\nand land varied from case to case. The land might have proceeded from\r\nthe lord and be held of the lord by the thegn as a perpetually\r\ninheritable estate, or as an estate granted to him for life, or granted\r\nto him and two successive heirs[669]; on the other hand, the lord's hold\r\nover the land might be slight and the bond between thegn and lord might\r\nbe a mere commendation which the thegn could at any time dissolve.\r\nAgain, the relation between thegn and lord is no longer conceived as a\r\nmenial, 'serviential' or ministerial relation. The _Taini Regis_ are\r\noften contrasted with the _Servientes Regis_[670]. The one trait of\r\nthegnship which comes out clearly on the face of our record is that the\r\nthegn is a man of war[671]. But even this trait is obscured by language\r\nwhich seems to show that there has been a great redistribution of\r\nmilitary service. Though there is no Latin word that will translate\r\n_thegn_ except _miles_, though these two terms are never contrasted with\r\neach other, and though there are thegns still existing, still of these\r\ntwo terms one belongs to the old, the other to the new order of\r\nthings[672]. Thus thegnship is already becoming antiquated and we are\r\nleft to guess from older dooms and later Leges what was its essence in\r\nthe days of King Edward.\r\n\r\n[Nature of thegnship.]\r\n\r\nThe task is difficult for we can see that this institution has undergone\r\nmany changes in the course of a long history and yet can not tell how\r\nmuch has remained unchanged. We begin by thinking of thegnship as a\r\nrelation between two men. The thegn is somebody's thegn. The household\r\nof the great man, but more especially the king's household, is the\r\ncradle of thegnship. The king's thegns are his free servants--servants\r\nbut also companions. In peace they have duties to perform about his\r\ncourt and about his person; they are his body-guard in war. Then the\r\nking--and other great lords follow his example--begins to give lands to\r\nhis thegns, and thus the nature of the thegnship is modified. The thegn\r\nno longer lives in his lord's court; he is a warrior endowed with land.\r\nThen the thegnship becomes more than a relationship, it becomes a\r\nstatus. The thegn is a 'twelve hundred man'; his wergild and his oath\r\ncountervail those of six ceorls. This status seems to be hereditary; the\r\nthegn's sons are 'dearer born' than are the sons of the ceorl[673]. But\r\nwe can not tell how far this principle is carried. We can not easily\r\nreconcile this hereditary transmission of thegn-right with the original\r\nprinciple that thegnship is a relation between two men. We may have\r\nthegns who are nobody's thegns, or else we may have persons entitled to\r\nthe thegnly wergild who yet are not thegns. What is more, since the law\r\nwhich regulates the inheritance of land does not favour the first-born,\r\nwe may have poor thegns and landless thegns. Yet another principle comes\r\ninto play. A duty of finding well armed warriors for the host is being\r\nterritorialized; every five hides should find a soldier. The thegn from\r\nof old has to attend the host with adequate equipment; the men who under\r\nthe new system have to attend the host with horse and heavy armour are\r\nusually thegns. Then the man who has five hides, and who therefore ought\r\nto put a warrior into the field, is a thegn or is entitled to be a\r\nthegn. The ceorl obtains the thegnly wergild if he has an estate rated\r\nfor military purposes at five hides. Another version of this tradition\r\nrequires of the ceorl who 'thrives to thegn-right' five hides of his own\r\nland, a church, a kitchen, a house in the _burh_, a special office in\r\nthe king's hall. To be 'worthy of thegn-right' may be one thing, to be a\r\nthegn, another. To be a thegn one must be some one's thegn. The\r\nprosperous ceorl will be no thegn until he has put himself under some\r\nlord. But the bond between him and his lord may be dissoluble at will\r\nand may hardly affect his land. It is, we repeat, very difficult to\r\ndiscover how these various principles were working together, checking\r\nand controlling each other in the first half of the eleventh century.\r\nSeveral inconsistent elements seem to be blended. There is the element\r\nof hereditary caste:--the thegn transmits thegnly blood to his\r\noffspring. There is the element of personal relationship:--he is the\r\nthegn of some lord and owes fealty to that lord. There is the military\r\nelement:--he is a warrior who has horse and heavy armour and is bound to\r\nfight the nation's battles. Connected with this last there is the\r\nproprietary element:--each five hides must send a warrior to the host;\r\nthe man with five hides is entitled to become, perhaps he may be\r\ncompelled to become a thegn, a warrior[674].\r\n\r\n[The thegns of Domesday.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we gather from Domesday Book that the military element is\r\nsubduing the others. The thegn is the man who for one reason or another\r\nis a warrior. For one reason or another, we say; for the class of thegns\r\nis by no means homogeneous. On the one hand, we see the thegns of the\r\nchurches, who have been endowed by the prelates in order that they may\r\ndo the military service due from the ecclesiastical lands. Many of the\r\nprelates have thegns, and for the creation of thegnlands by the churches\r\nit would not be easy to find any explanation save that which we have\r\nalready found in the territorialization of military service. The thegn\r\nmight pay some annual 'recognition' to the church, he might send his\r\nlabourers to help his lord for a day or two at harvest time; but we may\r\nbe sure that he was not rack-rented and that, if military service be\r\nleft out of account, the church was a loser by endowing him. Here the\r\nland proceeds from the lord to the thegn; the thegn can not give or sell\r\nit; the holder of that land can have no lord but the church; if he\r\nforfeits the land, he forfeits it to the church. But, on the other hand,\r\nwe see numerous king's thegns who are able 'to go to what lord they\r\nplease.' We may see in them landed proprietors who by the play of 'the\r\nfive hide rule' have become bound to serve as warriors. We may be fairly\r\ncertain that they have not been endowed by the king, otherwise they\r\nwould not enjoy the liberty, that marvellous liberty, of leaving him, of\r\nputting themselves under the protection and the banner of some earl or\r\nsome prelate. Not that every thegn will (if we may borrow phrases from a\r\nlater age) possess a full 'thegn's fee' or owe the service of a whole\r\nwarrior. Large groups of thegns we may see who obviously are brothers or\r\ncousins enjoying in undivided shares the inheritance of some dead\r\nancestor. They may take it in turns to go to the war; the king may hold\r\nthe eldest of them responsible for all the service; but each of them\r\nwill be called a thegn, will be entitled to a thegnly wergild and swear\r\na thegnly oath. Still, on the whole, the thegn of Domesday Book is a\r\nwarrior, and he holds--though perhaps along with his coparceners--land\r\nthat is bound to supply a warrior.\r\n\r\n[Greater and lesser thegns.]\r\n\r\nIn the main all thegns seem to have the same legal status, though they\r\nmay not be all of equal rank. All of them seem to have the wergild of\r\ntwelve hundred shillings. A law of Cnut, after describing the heriot of\r\nthe earl, distinguishes two classes of thegns; there is 'the king's\r\nthegn who is nighest to him' and whose heriot includes four horses and\r\n50 mancuses of gold, and 'the middle thegn' or 'less thegn' from whom he\r\ngets but one horse and one set of arms or £2.[675] This law should we\r\nthink be read in connexion with the rule that is recorded by Domesday\r\nBook as prevailing in the shires of Derby and Nottingham:--the thegn who\r\nhad fewer than seven manors paid a relief of 3 marks to the sheriff,\r\nwhile he who had seven and upwards paid £8 to the king[676]. A rude line\r\nis drawn between the richer and the poorer thegns of the king. The\r\nformer deal immediately with the king and pay their reliefs directly to\r\nhim; the latter are under the sheriff and their reliefs are comprised in\r\nhis farm. Thus the wealthy thegns, like the _barones maiores_ of later\r\ndays, are 'nigher to' the king than are the 'less-thegns' or those\r\n_barones minores_ who in a certain sense are their successors.\r\n\r\n[The great lords.]\r\n\r\nThe kings, the earls and the churches have of course many demesne\r\nmanors. Of the ecclesiastical estates we shall speak in our next essay,\r\nfor they can be best examined in the light that is cast upon them by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon charters. Here we will merely observe that some of the\r\nchurches have not only large, but well compacted territories. The abbey\r\nof St. Etheldreda, for example, besides having outlying manors, holds\r\nthe two hundreds which make up the isle of Ely; her property in\r\nCambridgeshire is valued at £318[677]. The earls also are rich in\r\ndemesne manors and so is the king.\r\n\r\n[The king as landlord.]\r\n\r\nKing William is much richer than King Edward was. The Conqueror has been\r\nchary in appointing earls and consequently he has in his hand, not only\r\nthe royal manors, but also a great many comital manors, to say nothing\r\nof some other estates which, for one reason or another, he has kept to\r\nhimself. Edward had been rich, but when compared with his earls he had\r\nnot been extravagantly rich. In Somersetshire, for example, there were\r\ntwelve royal manors which may have brought in a revenue of £500 or\r\nthereabouts, while there were fifteen comital manors which were worth\r\nnearly £300[678]. The royal demesne had been a scattered territory; the\r\nking had something in most shires, but was far richer in some than in\r\nothers. It was not so much in the number of his manors as in their size\r\nand value that he excelled the richest of his subjects. Somehow or\r\nanother he had acquired many of those vills which were to be the smaller\r\nboroughs and the market towns of later days. We may well suppose that\r\nfrom of old the vills that a king would wish to get and to keep would be\r\nthe flourishing vills, but again we can not doubt that many a vill has\r\nprospered because it was the king's.\r\n\r\n[The ancient demesne.]\r\n\r\nAmong the manors which William holds in the south-west a distinction is\r\ndrawn by the Exeter Domesday. The manors which the Confessor held are\r\n'The King's Demesne which belongs to the kingdom,' while those which\r\nwere held by the house of Godwin are the 'Comital Manors[679].' So in\r\nEast Anglia certain manors are distinguished as pertaining or having\r\npertained to the kingdom or kingship, the _regnum_ or _regio_[680]. This\r\ndoes not seem to have implied that they were inalienably annexed to the\r\ncrown, for King Edward had given some of them away. Neither when it\r\nspeaks of the time of William, nor when it speaks of the time of Edward,\r\ndoes our record draw any clear line between those manors which the king\r\nholds as king and those which he holds in his private capacity, though\r\nit may just hint that certain ancient estates ought not to be alienated.\r\nThe degree in which the various manors of the crown stood outside the\r\nnational system of finance, justice and police we can not accurately\r\nascertain. Some, but by no means all, pay no geld. Of some it is said\r\nthat they have never paid geld. Perhaps in these ingeldable manors we\r\nmay see those which constituted the royal demesne of the West Saxon\r\nkings at some remote date. Of the king's vill of Gomshall in Surrey it\r\nis written: 'the villeins of this vill were free from all the affairs of\r\nthe sheriff[681],' as though it were no general truth that with a royal\r\nmanor the sheriff had nothing to do.\r\n\r\n[The comital manors.]\r\n\r\nAs with the estates of the king, so with the estates of the earls, we\r\nfind it impossible to distinguish between private property and official\r\nproperty. Certain manors are regarded as the 'manors of the shire'\r\n(_mansiones de comitatu_[682]); certain vills are 'comital vills[683],'\r\nthey belong to 'the consulate[684].' Hereditary right tempered by\r\noutlawry was fast becoming the title by which the earldoms were holden.\r\nThe position of the house of Leofric in Mercia was far from being as\r\nstrong as the position of the house of Rolf in Normandy, and yet we may\r\nbe sure that King Harold would not have been able to treat the sons of\r\nÆlfgar as removable officers. But one of the best marked features of\r\nDomesday Book, a feature displayed on page after page, the enormous\r\nwealth of the house of Godwin, seems only explicable by the supposition\r\nthat the earlships and the older ealdormanships had carried with them a\r\ntitle to the enjoyment of wide lands. That enormous wealth had been\r\nacquired within a marvellously short time. Godwin was a new man: nothing\r\ncertain is known of his ancestry. His daughter's marriage with the king\r\nwill account for something; Harold's marriage with the daughter of\r\nÆlfgar will account for something, for instance, for manors which Harold\r\nheld in the middle of Ælfgar's country[685]; and a great deal of simple\r\nrapacity is laid to the charge of Harold by jurors whose testimony is\r\nnot to be lightly rejected[686]; but the greater part of the land\r\nascribed to Godwin, his widow and his sons, seems to consist of\r\n_comitales villae_.\r\n\r\n[Private rights and governmental revenues.]\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the earls is a matter of great importance. If we subtract\r\nthe estates of the king, the estates of the earls, and the estates of\r\nthe churches--and, as we shall see hereafter, the churches had obtained\r\nthe bulk of their wealth directly from the kings,--if we subtract again\r\nthe lands which the king, the earls, the churches have granted to their\r\nthegns, the England of 1065 will not appear to us a land of very great\r\nlandowners, and we may obtain a valuable hint as to one of the origins\r\nof feudalism. A vast amount of land is or has recently been held by\r\noffice-holders, by the holders of the kingship, the earlships, or the\r\nealdormanships. We seem to see their proprietary rights arising in the\r\nsphere of public law, growing out of governmental rights, which however\r\nthemselves are conceived as being in some sort proprietary. Many a\r\npassage in Domesday Book will suggest to us that a right to take tribute\r\nand a right to take the profits of justice have helped to give the king\r\nand the earls their manors and their seignories. Even in his own demesne\r\nmanors the king is apt to appear rather as a tribute taker than as a\r\nlandowner. Manors of very unequal size and value have had to supply him\r\nwith equal quantities of victuals; each has to give 'a night's farm'\r\nonce a year. Then from the counties at large he has taken a tribute;\r\nfrom Oxfordshire, for example, £10 for a hawk, 20 shillings for a\r\nsumpter horse, £23 for dogs and 6 sesters of honey[687]; from\r\nWorcestershire £10 or a Norway hawk, 20 shillings for a sumpter\r\nhorse[688]; from Warwickshire £23 for 'the dog's custom,' 20 shillings\r\nfor a sumpter horse, £10 for a hawk and 24 sesters of honey[689]. The\r\nfarm of the county that the sheriff pays is made up out of obscure old\r\nitems of this sort. Many men who are not the king's tenants must assist\r\nhim in his hunting, must help in the erection of his deer-hays[690].\r\nThen there are the _avera_ and the _inwards_ that are exacted by the\r\nking or his sheriff from sokemen who are not the king's men. The sheriff\r\nalso is entitled to provender rents; out of 'the revenues which belong\r\nto the shrievalty' of Wiltshire, Edward of Salisbury gets pigs, wheat,\r\nbarley, oats, honey, poultry, eggs, cheeses, lambs and fleeces; and\r\nbesides this he seems to have 'reveland' which belongs to him as\r\nsheriff[691]. Then we see curious payments in money and renders in kind\r\nmade to some royal or some comital manor by the holders of other manors.\r\nIn Devonshire, Charlton which belongs to the Bishop of Coutances,\r\nHoniton which belongs to the Count of Mortain, Smaurige which belongs to\r\nRalph de Pomerai, Membury which belongs to William Chevre, Roverige\r\nwhich belongs to St. Mary of Rouen, each of these manors used to pay\r\ntwenty pence a year to the royal manor of Axminster[692]. In\r\nSomersetshire there are manors which have owed _consuetudines_, masses\r\nof iron and sheep and lambs to the royal manors of South Perrott and\r\nCury, or the comital manors of Crewkerne and Dulverton[693]. Then again,\r\nwe find that pasture rights are connected with justiciary\r\nrights:--Godwin had a manor in Hampshire to which belonged the third\r\npenny of six hundreds, and in all the woods of those six hundreds he had\r\nfree pasture and pannage[694]; the third penny of three hundreds in\r\nDevonshire and the third animal of the moorland pastures were annexed to\r\nthe manor of Molland[695]. Many things seem to indicate that the\r\ndistinction between private rights and governmental powers has been but\r\nfaintly perceived in the past.\r\n\r\n[The English state.]\r\n\r\nIf now we look at that English state which is the outcome of a purely\r\nEnglish history, we see that it has already taken a pyramidal or conical\r\nshape. It is a society of lords and men. At its base are the cultivators\r\nof the soil, at its apex is the king. This cone is as yet but low. Even\r\nat the end of William's reign the peasant seldom had more than two lords\r\nbetween him and the king, but already in the Confessor's reign he might\r\nwell have three[696]. Also the cone is obtuse: the angle at its apex\r\nwill grow acuter under Norman rulers. We can indeed obtain no accurate\r\nstatistics, but the number of landholders who were King Edward's men\r\nmust have been much larger than the tale of the Norman tenants in chief.\r\nIn the geographical distribution of the large estates under William\r\nthere is but little more regularity than there was under his\r\npredecessor. In Cheshire and in Shropshire the Conqueror formed two\r\ngreat fiefs for Hugh of Avranches and Roger of Montgomery, well\r\ncompacted fiefs, the like of which England had not yet seen. But the\r\nunits which William found in existence and which he distributed among\r\nhis followers were for the more part discrete units, and seldom did the\r\nNorman baron acquire as his honour any wide stretch of continuous\r\nterritory. Still a great change took place in the substance of the cone,\r\nor if that substance is made up of lords and men and acres, then in the\r\nnature of, or rather the relation between, the forces which held the\r\natoms together. Every change makes for symmetry, simplicity,\r\nconsolidation. Some of these changes will seem to us predestined. To\r\nspeculate as to what would have happened had Harold repelled the invader\r\nwould be vain, and certainly we have no reason for believing that in\r\nthat case the formula of dependent tenure would ever have got hold of\r\nevery acre of English land and every right in English land. The law of\r\n'land loans' (_Lehnrecht_) would hardly have become our only land law,\r\nhad not a conqueror enjoyed an unbounded power, or a power bounded only\r\nby some reverence for the churches, of deciding by what men and on what\r\nterms every rood of England should be holden. Had it not been for this,\r\nwe should surely have had some _franc alleu_ to oppose to the _fief_,\r\nsome _Eigen_ to oppose to the _Lehn_. But if England was not to be for\r\never a prey to rebellions and civil wars, the power of the lords over\r\ntheir men must have been--not indeed increased, but--territorialized;\r\nthe liberty of 'going with one's land to whatever lord one chose' must\r\nhave been curtailed. As yet the central force embodied in the kingship\r\nwas too feeble to deal directly with every one of its subjects, to\r\ngovern them and protect them. The intermediation of the lords was\r\nnecessary; the state could not but be pyramidal; and, while this was so,\r\nthe freedom that men had of forsaking one lord for another, of forsaking\r\neven the king for the ambitious earl, was a freedom that was akin to\r\nanarchy. Such a liberty must have its wings clipt; free contract must be\r\ntaught to know its place; the lord's hold over the man's land must\r\nbecome permanent. This change, if it makes at first for a more definite\r\nfeudalism, or (to use words more strictly) if it substitutes feudalism\r\nfor vassalism, makes also for the stability of the state, for the\r\nincrease of the state's power over the individual, and in the end for\r\nthe disappearance of feudalism. The freeholder of the thirteenth\r\ncentury is much more like the subject of a modern state than was the\r\nfree man of the Confessor's day who could place himself and his land\r\nunder the power and warranty of whatever lord he chose. Lordship in\r\nbecoming landlordship begins to lose its most dangerous element; it is\r\nceasing to be a religion, it is becoming a 'real' right, a matter for\r\nprivate law. Again, we may guess, if we please, that but for the Norman\r\nConquest the mass of the English peasantry would never have fallen so\r\nlow as fall it did. The 'sokemen' would hardly have been turned into\r\n'villeins,' the 'villeins' would hardly have become 'serfs.' And yet the\r\nvilleins of the Confessor's time were in a perilous position. Already\r\nthey were occupying lands which for two most important purposes were\r\nreckoned the lands of their lords, lands for which their lords gelded,\r\nlands for which their lords fought. Even in an English England the time\r\nmight have come when the state, refusing to look behind their lords,\r\nwould have left the protection of their rights to a _Hofrecht_, to 'the\r\ncustom of the manor.'\r\n\r\n[Last words.]\r\n\r\nIt is, we repeat it, vain to speculate about such matters, for we know\r\ntoo little of the relative strength of the various forces that were at\r\nwork, and an accident, a war, a famine, may at any moment decide the\r\nfate, even the legal fate, of a great class. And above all there is the\r\nunanswerable question whether Harold or any near successor of his would\r\nor could have done what William did so soon as the survey was\r\naccomplished, when he proved that, after all, the pyramid was no pyramid\r\nand that every particle of it was in immediate contact with him, and\r\n'there came to him all the land-sitting men who were worth aught from\r\nover all England, whosesoever men they were, and they bowed themselves\r\nto him, and became this man's men[697].'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [618] D.

Ib. 20 b:\r\n        'Abbas de Grestain tenet de Comite 2 hidas in Bedingham.'\r\n\r\n  [619] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 220.\r\n\r\n  [620] D. B. i. 218 b: 'Rex vero Willelmus sibi postea in elemosina\r\n        concessit, unde pro anima Regis et Regine omni ebdomada 2\r\n        feria missam persolvit.' D.

Ib. 32: 'servitium unius\r\n        militis.' Ib. 151 b: 'inveniebat 2 loricatos in custodiam de\r\n        Windesores.'\r\n\r\n  [622] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 268.\r\n\r\n  [623] But D. B. i. 218 b gives us 'tenet in ministerio Regis.'\r\n\r\n  [624] D. B. i. 4 b: 'De terra huius manerii tenet Godefridus in feuo\r\n        dimid. solin.' Ib. 36 b: 'Humfridus Camerarius tenet de feuo\r\n        Reginae Cumbe.' Ib. 336 b: 'Ipsam [domum] clamat Normannus\r\n        Crassus de feuo Regis.'\r\n\r\n  [625] D. B. i. 129 b: 'Postea Willelmus Camerarius tenuit de Regina\r\n        in feudo pro 3 lib. per annum de firma, et post mortem Reginae\r\n        eodem modo tenuit de Rege.'\r\n\r\n  [626] But, as in general a farmer would have no heritable rights,\r\n        holding in fee may be contrasted with holding in farm. D. B.\r\n        i. 230 b: 'Has terras habet Goduinus de Rege ad firmam, Dislea\r\n        vero tenet de Rege in feudo.' So again it may be contrasted\r\n        with the husband's rights in his wife's marriage portion. D.\r\n        B. i. 214 b: 'De ista terra tenet Pirotus 3 hidas de maritagio\r\n        suae feminae et unam hidam et terciam partem unius hidae tenet\r\n        in feudum de Nigello.'\r\n\r\n  [627] D. B. i. 158: Robert de Ouilly holds forty-two houses in\r\n        Oxford, some meadow-land and a mill 'cum beneficio S. Petri,'\r\n        i.e. together with the benefice of S. Peter's church.\r\n        Elsewhere, i. 273, we read that King William gave a manor to\r\n        the monks of Burton 'pro beneficio suo'; but the meaning of\r\n        this is by no means clear.\r\n\r\n  [628] D. B. i. 44 b: 'Duo liberi homines tenuerunt de Alwino sed non\r\n        fuit alod.' The same phrase occurs on f. 46.\r\n\r\n  [629] D. B. i. 22: 'Aluuard et Algar tenuerunt de Rege pro 2\r\n        maneriis in alodia ... Ælueua tenuit de Rege Edwardo sicut\r\n        alodium.' Ib. 26: 'Godwinus Comes tenuit et de eo 7 aloarii.'\r\n\r\n  [630] D. B. i. 60 b: 'Duo alodiarii tenuerunt T. R. E. ... unus\r\n        servivit Reginae, alter Bundino.'\r\n\r\n  [631] D. B. i. 1: 'Quando moritur alodiarius, Rex inde habet\r\n        relevationem terrae.'\r\n\r\n  [632] D. B. i. 52 b: 'Has hidas tenuerunt 7 alodiarii de Episcopo\r\n        nec poterant recedere alio vel ab illo.'\r\n\r\n  [633] D. B. i. 63 b: 'Ibi sunt 5 alodiarii.'\r\n\r\n  [634] See charter of John for St Augustin's, Canterbury, Rot. Cart.\r\n        p. 105: 'omnes allodiarios quos eis habemus datos.' This\r\n        phrase seems to descend through a series of charters from two\r\n        charters of the Conqueror in which the 'swa fele þegna swa ic\r\n        heom togeleton habbe' of the one appears in the other as\r\n        'omnes allodiarios.' If so, we get from the Conqueror's own\r\n        chancery the equation þegn=alodiarius. Hist. Mon. S. August.\r\n        349-50.\r\n\r\n  [635] D. B. i. 23: in two successive entries we have 'Offa tenuit de\r\n        Episcopo in feudo.... Almar tenuit de Goduino Comite in\r\n        alodium.' So again, i. 59: 'Blacheman tenuit de Heraldo Comite\r\n        in alodio.... Blacheman tenuit in feudo T. R. E.' The\r\n        suggestion has been made that _alodium_ represents\r\n        _book-land_; see Pollock, Land Laws, ed. 3. p. 27; Eng. Hist.\r\n        Rev. xi. 227; but we gravely doubt whether the humbler\r\n        _alodiarii_ had books. The author of the Quadripartitus\r\n        renders _bócland_ by _terra hereditaria_, _terra\r\n        testimentalis_, _terra libera_, and even by _feudum_ (Edg. II.\r\n        2); _alodium_ occurs in the Instituta Cnuti. After this we can\r\n        hardly say for certain that D. B. does not use _alodium_ and\r\n        _feodum_ as equivalents, both representing a heritable estate,\r\n        as absolute an ownership of land as is conceivable.\r\n\r\n  [636] Hist. Eng.

At completeness\r\nwe must not aim, and in our first words we ought to protest that no\r\ngeneral theory will tell the story of every or any particular town[698].\r\n\r\n[The borough in cent. xiii.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century a legal, though a wavering, line is drawn\r\nbetween the borough and the mere vill or rural township[699]. It is a\r\nwavering line, for stress can be laid now upon one and now upon another\r\nattribute of the ancient and indubitable boroughs, and this selected\r\nattribute can then be employed as a test for the claims of other towns.\r\nWhen in Edward I.'s day the sheriffs are being told to bid every borough\r\nsend two burgesses to the king's parliaments, there are somewhat more\r\nthan 150 places to which such summonses will at times be addressed,\r\nthough before the end of the middle ages the number of 'parliamentary\r\nboroughs' will have shrunk to 100 or thereabouts[700]. Many towns seem\r\nto hover on the border line and in some cases the sheriff has been able\r\nto decide whether or no a town shall be represented in the councils of\r\nthe realm. Yet if we go back to the early years of the tenth century, we\r\nshall still find this contrast between the borough and the mere township\r\nexisting as a contrast whence legal consequences flow. Where lies the\r\ncontrast? What is it that makes a borough to be a borough? That is the\r\nproblem that we desire to solve. It is a legal problem. We are not to\r\nask why some places are thickly populated or why trade has flowed in\r\nthis or that channel. We are to ask why certain vills are severed from\r\nother vills and are called boroughs.\r\n\r\n[The number of the boroughs.]\r\n\r\nWe may reasonably wish, however, since mental pictures must be painted,\r\nto know at the outset whereabouts the line will be drawn, and whether\r\nwhen we are speaking of the Conqueror's reign and earlier times we shall\r\nhave a large or a small number of boroughs on our hands. Will it be a\r\nhundred and fifty, or a hundred, or will it be only fifty? At once we\r\nwill say that some fifty boroughs stand out prominently and will demand\r\nour best attention, though a second and far less important class was\r\nalready being formed.\r\n\r\n[The aid-paying boroughs of cent. xii.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the twelfth century the Exchequer was treating certain\r\nplaces in an exceptional fashion. It was subjecting them to a special\r\ntax in the form of an _auxilium_ or _donum_. This fact we may take as\r\nthe starting point for our researches. Now if we read the unique Pipe\r\nRoll of Henry I.'s reign and the earliest Pipe Rolls of Henry II.'s we\r\nobserve that an 'aid' or a 'gift' is from time to time collected from\r\nthe 'cities and boroughs,' and if we put down the names of the towns\r\nwhich are charged with this impost, we obtain a remarkable result[701].\r\nSpeaking broadly we may say that the only towns which pay are 'county\r\ntowns.' For a large part of England this is strictly true. We will\r\nfollow the order of Domesday Book, beginning however with its second\r\nzone. If London is in Middlesex[702], it is Middlesex's one borough. In\r\nHertfordshire is Hertford. In Buckinghamshire is Buckingham, but no aid\r\ncan be expected from it. In Oxfordshire is Oxford. In Gloucestershire is\r\nGloucester, but Winchcombe also asserts its burghal rank. In\r\nWorcestershire is Worcester, while Droitwich appears occasionally with a\r\nsmall gift. Hereford is the one borough of Herefordshire. Turning to the\r\nthird zone, we pass rapidly through Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire,\r\nBedfordshire and Northamptonshire; each has its borough. This will be\r\ntrue of Leicestershire also; but Leicester is by this time so completely\r\nin the hands of its earl that the king gets nothing from it. Nor, it\r\nwould seem, does he get anything from Warwick. Half in Warwickshire,\r\nhalf in Staffordshire lies Tamworth; Stafford also pays. At times\r\nBridgenorth appears beside Shrewsbury. Nothing is received from Chester,\r\nfor it is the head of a palatinate. Derby, Nottingham and York are the\r\nonly representatives of their shires. Lincolnshire has Stamford on its\r\nborder as well as Lincoln in its centre. Norfolk has Thetford as well as\r\nNorwich; but Suffolk has only Ipswich and Essex only Colchester.\r\n\r\n[Aid-paying boroughs in the south.]\r\n\r\nIn the southern zone matters are not so simple. Kent contains Canterbury\r\nand Rochester; Surrey contains Guildford and Southwark; Sussex only\r\nChichester. Hampshire has Winchester; Southampton is receiving special\r\ntreatment. Wallingford represents Berkshire. When we get to Wiltshire\r\nand Dorset we are in the classical land of small boroughs. There are\r\nvarious little towns whose fate is in the balance; Marlborough and Calne\r\nseem for the moment to be the most prominent. In Somersetshire, whatever\r\nmay have been true in the past, Ilchester is standing out as the one\r\nborough that pays an aid. Exeter has now no second in Devonshire. If\r\nthere is a borough in Cornwall, it makes no gift to the king.\r\n\r\n[List of aids.]\r\n\r\nWe may obtain some notion of the relative rank of these towns if we set\r\nforth the amounts with which they are charged in 1130 and in 1156,\r\nthough the materials for this comparison are unfortunately incomplete.\r\n\r\n                           Pipe Roll     Pipe Roll\r\n                           31 Hen.

We\r\nhave made no mention of flourishing seaports, of Dover, Hastings,\r\nBristol, Yarmouth. Nor is this a list of all the places that are\r\ncasually called _burgi_ on rolls of Henry II.'s reign. That name is\r\ngiven to Scarborough, Knaresborough, Tickhill, Cirencester and various\r\nother towns. New tests of 'burgality' (if we may make that word) are\r\nemerging and old tests are becoming obsolete. We see too that some towns\r\nare dropping out of the list of aid-paying boroughs. In 1130 Wallingford\r\nhas thrice failed to pay its aid of £15 and the whole debt of £45 must\r\nbe forgiven to the burgesses _pro paupertate eorum_[706]. So Wallingford\r\ndrops out of this list. Probably Buckingham has dropped out at an\r\nearlier time for a similar reason. But still this list, especially in\r\nthe form that it takes in Henry I.'s time, is of great importance to\r\nthose who are going to study the boroughs of Domesday Book. It looks\r\nlike a traditional list. It deals out nice round sums. It is\r\nendeavouring to keep Wallingford on a par with Gloucester and above\r\nNorthampton. It is retaining Winchcombe.\r\n\r\n[The boroughs in Domesday.]\r\n\r\nIf we make the experiment, we shall discover that this catalogue really\r\nis a good prologue to Domesday Book. We will once more visit the\r\ncounties which form the second zone. The account that our record gives\r\nof Hertfordshire has a preface. That preface deals with the borough of\r\nHertford and precedes even the list of the Hertfordshire tenants in\r\nchief. Buckingham in Buckinghamshire and Oxford in Oxfordshire are\r\nsimilarly treated. In Gloucestershire the city of Gloucester and the\r\nborough of Winchcombe are described before the body of the county is\r\ntouched. In Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Cambridgeshire,\r\nHuntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire,\r\nWarwickshire, Staffordshire[707], Shropshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire,\r\nNottinghamshire[708] and Yorkshire the same procedure is adopted: the\r\naccount of the shire's city or borough precedes the account of the\r\nshire. In Lincolnshire the description of the county is introduced by\r\nthe description of Lincoln and Stamford; also of Torksey, which had\r\nbeen a place of military importance and seems to have been closely\r\nunited with the city of Lincoln by some governmental bond[709].\r\nConvenient arrangement is not the strong point of 'Little Domesday'; but\r\nwhat is said therein of Colchester is said at the very end of the survey\r\nof Essex, while Norwich, Yarmouth and Thetford stand at the end of the\r\nroyal estates in Norfolk, and Ipswich stands at the end of the royal\r\nestates in Suffolk.\r\n\r\n[Southern boroughs in Domesday.]\r\n\r\nIf now we enter the southern zone and keep in our minds the scheme that\r\nwe have seen prevailing in the greater part of England, we shall observe\r\nthat the account of Kent has a prologue touching Dover, Canterbury and\r\nRochester. In Berkshire an excellent account of Wallingford precedes the\r\nrubric _Terra Regis_. Four places in Dorset are singled out for\r\nprefatory treatment, namely, Dorchester, Bridport, Wareham and\r\nShaftesbury. In Devon Exeter stands, if we may so speak, above the line,\r\nand stands alone, though Barnstaple, Lidford and Totness are reckoned as\r\nboroughs. Of the other counties there is more to be said. If we compare\r\nthe first page of the survey of Somerset with the first pages that are\r\ndevoted to its two neighbours, Dorset and Devon, we shall probably come\r\nto the conclusion that the compilers of the book scrupled to put any\r\nSomerset vill on a par with Exeter, Dorchester, Bridport, Wareham and\r\nShaftesbury. In each of the three cases the page is mapped out in\r\nprecisely the same fashion. The second column is headed by _Terra\r\nRegis_. A long way down in the first column begins the list of tenants\r\nin chief. The upper part of the first column contains in one case the\r\naccount of Exeter, in another the account of the four Dorset boroughs,\r\nbut in the third case, that of Somerset, it is left blank. In Wiltshire\r\nMalmesbury and Marlborough stand above the line; but, if we look to the\r\nfoot of the page, we shall suspect that the compilers can not easily\r\nforce their general scheme upon this part of the country. In Surrey no\r\nplace stands above the line. Guildford is the first place mentioned on\r\nthe _Terra Regis_; Southwark seems to be inadequately treated on a later\r\npage. The case of Sussex is like that of Somerset; the list of the\r\ntenants in chief is preceded by a blank space. In Hampshire a whole\r\ncolumn is left blank. On a later page the borough of Southampton has a\r\ncolumn to itself; in the next column stands the _Terra Regis_ of the\r\nIsle of Wight. And now let us turn back to the Middlesex that we have as\r\nyet ignored. Nearly two columns, to say nothing of some precedent pages,\r\nare void[710].\r\n\r\n[The boroughs and the plan of Domesday Book.]\r\n\r\nNow we must not be led away into speculations which would be vain. We\r\nmust not, for example, inquire whether the information that had been\r\nobtained touching London and Winchester was too bulky to fill a room\r\nthat had been left for it. We must not inquire whether something was to\r\nbe said of Chichester or Hastings, of Ilchester or of Bristol that has\r\nnot been said. But apparently we may attribute to King William's\r\nofficials a certain general idea. It is an idea which suits the greater\r\npart of England very well, though they find difficulties in their way\r\nwhen they endeavour to impose it on some of the counties that lie south\r\nof the Thames. The broad fact stands clear that throughout the larger\r\npart of England the commissioners found a town in each county, and in\r\ngeneral one town only, which required special treatment. They do not\r\nlocate it on the _Terra Regis_; they do not locate it on any man's land.\r\nIt stands outside the general system of land tenure.\r\n\r\n[The borough on no man's land.]\r\n\r\nFor a while, then, let us confine our attention to these county towns,\r\nand we shall soon see why it is that they are rarely brought under any\r\nrubric which would describe them as pieces of the king's soil or pieces\r\nof some one else's soil. The trait to which we allude we shall call (for\r\nwant of a better term) the tenurial heterogeneity of the burgesses. In\r\nthose boroughs that are fully described we seldom, if ever, find that\r\nall the burgesses have the same landlord. Of course there is a sense in\r\nwhich, according to the view of the Domesday surveyors and of all later\r\nlawyers, every inch of borough land is held of one landlord, namely, the\r\nking; but in that sense every inch of England has the same landlord. The\r\nfact that we would bring into relief is this, that normally the\r\nburgesses of the borough do not hold their burgages immediately of one\r\nand the same lord; they are not 'peers of a tenure'; the group that they\r\nconstitute is not a tenurial group. Far rather we shall find that,\r\nthough there will be some burgesses holding immediately of the king,\r\nthere will be others whose titles can be traced to the king only through\r\nthe medium of other lords. And the mesne lord will often be a very great\r\nman, some prelate or baron with a widespread honour. Within the borough\r\nhe will, to use the language of Domesday Book, 'have' or 'hold' a small\r\ngroup of burgesses, and sometimes they will be reckoned as annexed to or\r\nas 'lying in' some manor distant from the town. It seems generally\r\nexpected that the barons of the county should have a few burgages apiece\r\nin the county town. This arrangement does not look new. Seemingly the\r\ngreat men of an earlier day, the _antecessores_ of the Frenchmen, have\r\nowned town-houses: not so much houses for their own use, as houses or\r\n'haws' (_hagae_) in which they could keep a few 'burgesses.'\r\n\r\n[Heterogeneous tenures in the boroughs.]\r\n\r\nSome examples of this remarkable arrangement should be given. First we\r\nwill look at Oxford. The king has many houses; the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury has 7; the Bishop of Winchester 9; the Bishop of Bayeux 18;\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln 30; the Bishop of Coutances 2; the Bishop of\r\nHereford 3; the Abbot of St Edmund's 1; the Abbot of Abingdon 14; the\r\nAbbot of Eynsham 13. And so with the worldly great:--the Count of\r\nMortain has 10; Count Hugh has 7; the Count of Evreux 1; Robert of\r\nOuilly 12; Roger of Ivry 15; Walter Giffard 17:--but we need not repeat\r\nthe whole long list[711].\r\n\r\nIt is so at Wallingford; King Edward had 8 virgates on which were 276\r\nhouses, and they paid him £11 rent; Bishop Walkelin of Winchester has\r\n27, which pay 25 shillings; the Abbot of Abingdon has two acres, on\r\nwhich are 7 houses paying 4 shillings; Milo Crispin has 20 houses, which\r\npay 12 shillings and 10 pence; and so forth[712]. Further, it is said\r\nthat the Bishop's 27 houses are valued in Brightwell; and, turning to\r\nthe account of Brightwell, there, sure enough, we find mention of the 25\r\nshillings which these houses pay[713]. Milo's 20 houses are said to 'lie\r\nin' Newnham; he has also in Wallingford 6 houses which are in Hazeley, 1\r\nwhich is in Stoke, 1 which is in Chalgrove, one acre with 6 houses which\r\nis in Sutton, one acre with 11 houses which is in Bray; 'all this land'\r\nwe are told 'belongs to Oxfordshire, but nevertheless it is in\r\nWallingford.' Yes, Milo's manor of Chalgrove lies five, his manor of\r\nHazeley lies seven miles from Wallingford; nevertheless, houses which\r\nare physically in Wallingford are constructively in Chalgrove and\r\nHazeley. That we are not dealing with a Norman novelty is in this case\r\nextremely plain. Wallingford is a border town. We read first of the\r\nBerkshire landowners who have burgesses within it. There follows a list\r\nof the Oxfordshire 'thegns' who hold houses in Wallingford. Archbishop\r\nLanfranc and Count Hugh appear in this context as 'thegns' of\r\nOxfordshire.\r\n\r\n[Examples of heterogeneity.]\r\n\r\nWhen we have obtained this clue, we soon begin to see that what is true\r\nof Oxford and Wallingford is true even of those towns of which no\r\nsubstantive description is given us. Thus there are 'haws' or\r\ntown-houses in Winchester which are attached to manors in all corners of\r\nHampshire, at Wallop, Clatford, Basingstoke, Eversley, Candover,\r\nStrathfield, Minstead and elsewhere. Some of the manors to which the\r\nburghers of London were attached are not, even in our own day, within\r\nour monstrous town; there are some at Banstead and Bletchingley in\r\nSurrey, at Waltham and Thurrock in Essex. But in every quarter we see\r\nthis curious scheme. At Warwick the king has in his demesne 113 houses,\r\nand his barons have 112[714]. Of the barons' houses it is written:\r\n'These houses belong to the lands which the barons hold outside the\r\nborough and are valued there.' Or turn we to a small town:--at\r\nBuckingham the barons have 26 burgesses; no one of them has more than\r\n5.[715] The page that tells us this presents to us an admirable contrast\r\nbetween Buckingham and its future rival. Aylesbury is just an ordinary\r\nroyal manor and stands under the rubric _Terra Regis_. Buckingham is a\r\nvery petty townlet; but it is a borough, and Count Hugh and the Bishop\r\nof Coutances, Robert of Ouilly, Roger of Ivry, Arnulf of Hesdin and\r\nother mighty men have burgesses there. As a climax we may mention the\r\ncase of Winchcombe. The burgages in this little town were held by many\r\ngreat people. About the year 1100 the king had 60; the Abbot of\r\nWinchcombe 40; the Abbot of Evesham 2; the Bishop of Hereford 2; Robert\r\nof Bellême 3; Robert Fitzhamon 5, and divers other persons of note had\r\nsome 29 houses among them[716]. However poor, however small Winchcombe\r\nmay have been, it radically differed from the common manor and the\r\ncommon village.\r\n\r\n[Burgesses attached to manors.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen above how in the Conqueror's day the Abbey of Westminster\r\nhad a manor at Staines[717] and how that manor included 48 burgesses who\r\npaid 40_s._ a year. Were those burgesses really in Staines, and was\r\nStaines a borough? No, they were in the city of London. The Confessor\r\nhad told his Middlesex thegns how he willed that St Peter and the\r\nbrethren at Westminster should have the manor (_cotlif_) of Staines with\r\nthe land called Staninghaw (_mid ðam lande Stæningehaga_) within London\r\nand all other things that had belonged to Staines[718]. Is not the guess\r\npermissible that Staining Lane in the City of London[719], wherein stood\r\nthe church of St Mary, Staining, was so called, not 'because stainers\r\nlived in it,' but because it once contained the haws of the men of\r\nStaines? We must be careful before we find boroughs in Domesday Book,\r\nfor its language is deceptive. Perhaps we may believe that really and\r\nphysically there were forty-six burgesses in the vill of St Albans[720];\r\nbut, after what we have read of Staines, can we be quite sure that these\r\nburgesses were not in London? The burgesses who de iure 'are in' one\r\nplace are often _de facto_ in quite another place.\r\n\r\n[Tenure of the borough and tenure of land within the borough.]\r\n\r\nWe may for a moment pass over two centuries and turn to the detailed\r\naccount of Cambridge given to us by the Hundred Rolls, the most\r\nelaborate description that we have of any medieval borough. Now in one\r\nsense the 'vill' or borough of Cambridge belongs to the king, and, under\r\nhim, to the burgesses, for they hold it of him _in capite_ at a fee-farm\r\nrent. But this does not mean that each burgess holds his tenement of the\r\ncorporation or _communitas_ of burgesses, which in its turn holds every\r\nyard of land of the king in chief. It does not even mean that each\r\nburgess holds immediately of the king, the _communitas_ intervening as\r\nfarmer of the king's rents[721]. No, the titles of the various burgesses\r\ngo up to the king by many various routes. Some of them pay rents to the\r\nofficers of the borough who are the king's farmers; but many of them do\r\nnot. The Chancellor and Masters of the University, for example, hold\r\nthree messuages in the vill of Cambridge; 'but' say the sworn burgesses\r\n'what they pay for the same, we do not know and can not discover[722].'\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Domesday Book shows us that the Count of\r\nBritanny had ten burgesses in Cambridge[723]. Count Alan's houses will\r\nnever be held in chief of the crown by any burgess: they will form part\r\nof the honour of Richmond to the end of time. We may take another\r\nexample which will show the permanence of proprietary arrangements in\r\nthe boroughs. From an account of Gloucester which comes to us from the\r\nyear 1100 or thereabouts we learn that there were 300 houses in the\r\nking's demesne and 313 belonging to other lords. From the year 1455 we\r\nhave another account which tells of 310 tenements paying landgavel to\r\nthe king's farmers and 346 which pay them nothing[724].\r\n\r\n[The king and other landlords.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no further examples are needed. But this tenurial heterogeneity\r\nseems to be an attribute of all or nearly all the very ancient boroughs,\r\nthe county towns. In some cases the king was the landlord of far the\r\ngreater number of the burgesses. In other cases the bishop became in\r\ncourse of time the lord of some large quarter of a town in which his\r\ncathedral stood. At Canterbury and Rochester, at Winchester and\r\nWorcester, this process had been at work from remote days; the bishops\r\nhad been acquiring land and 'haws' within the walls[725]. But we can see\r\nthat in Henry I.'s day there were still four earls who were keeping up\r\ntheir interest in their burgesses at Winchester[726]. In the later\r\nmiddle ages we may, if we will, call these places royal boroughs and the\r\nking's 'demesne boroughs,' for the burgesses derive their 'liberties'\r\ndirectly from the king. But we must keep these ancient boroughs well\r\napart from any royal manors which the king has newly raised to burghal\r\nrank. In the latter he will be the immediate landlord of every burgess;\r\nin the former a good deal of rent will be paid, not to him, nor to the\r\ncommunity as his farmers, but to those who are filling the shoes of the\r\nthegns of the shire.\r\n\r\n[The oldest burh.]\r\n\r\nThis said, we will turn back our thoughts to the oldest days. The word\r\nthat deserves our best attention is _burh_, the future _borough_, for\r\nlittle good would come of an attempt to found a theory upon the Latin\r\nwords, such as _civitas_, _oppidum_ and _urbs_ which occur in some of\r\nthose magniloquent land-books[727]. Now it seems fairly clear that for\r\nsome long time after the Germanic invasions the word _burh_ meant merely\r\na fastness, a stronghold, and suggested no thick population nor any\r\npopulation at all. This we might learn from the map of England. The\r\nhill-top that has been fortified is a _burh_. Very often it has given\r\nits name to a neighbouring village[728]. But, to say nothing of hamlets,\r\nwe have full two hundred and fifty parishes whose names end in _burgh_,\r\n_borough_ or _bury_, and in many cases we see no sign in them of an\r\nancient camp or of an exceptionally dense population. It seems a mere\r\nchance that they are not _tons_ or _hams_, _worths_ or _thorpes_. Then\r\nagain, in Essex and neighbouring shires it is common to find that in the\r\nvillage called _X_ there is a squire's mansion or a cluster of houses\r\ncalled _X-bury_. Further, we can see plainly from our oldest laws that\r\nthe palisade or entrenchment around a great man's house is a _burh_.\r\nThus Alfred: The king's _burh-bryce_ (the sum to be paid for breaking\r\nhis _burh_) is 120 shillings, an archbishop's 90 shillings, another\r\nbishop's 60 shillings, a twelve-hundred man's 30 shillings, a\r\nsix-hundred-man's 15 shillings, a ceorl's edor-bryce (the sum to be paid\r\nfor breaking his hedge) 5 shillings[729]. The ceorl, whose _wer_ is 200\r\nshillings, will not have a _burh_, he will only have a hedge round his\r\nhouse; but the man whose _wer_ is 600 shillings will probably have some\r\nstockade, some rude rampart; he will have a _burh_.\r\n\r\n[The king's burh.]\r\n\r\nWe observe the heavy _bót_ of 120 shillings which protects the king's\r\n_burh_. May we not see here the very first stage in the legal history of\r\nour boroughs? We pass over some centuries and we read in a statement of\r\nthe Londoners' customs that a man who is guilty of unlawful violence\r\nmust pay the king's _burh-bryce_ of five pounds[730]. And then the\r\nDomesday surveyors tell us how at Canterbury every crime committed in\r\nthose streets which run right through the city is a crime against the\r\nking, and so it is if committed upon the high-roads outside the city for\r\nthe space of one league, three perches and three feet[731]. This curious\r\naccuracy over perches and feet sends us to another ancient\r\ndocument:--'Thus far shall the king's peace (_grið_) extend from his\r\n_burhgeat_ where he is sitting towards all four quarters, namely, three\r\nmiles, three furlongs, three acre-breadths, nine feet, nine\r\nhand-breadths, nine barley-corns[732].' And then we remember how Fleta\r\ntells us that the verge of the king's palace is twelve leagues in\r\ncircumference, and how within that ambit the palace court, the king's\r\nmost private court, has jurisdiction[733].\r\n\r\n[The special peace of the burh.]\r\n\r\nHas not legal fiction been at work since an early time? Has not the\r\nsanctity of the king's house extended itself over a group of houses? The\r\nterm _burh_ seems to spread outwards from the defensible house of the\r\nking and with it the sphere of his _burh-bryce_ is amplified. Within the\r\nborough there reigns a special peace. This has a double meaning:--not\r\nonly do acts which would be illegal anywhere become more illegal when\r\nthey are done within the borough, but acts which would be legal\r\nelsewhere, are illegal there. King Edmund legislating against the\r\nblood-feud makes his _burh_ as sacred as a church; it is a sanctuary\r\nwhere the feud may not be prosecuted[734]. If in construing such a\r\npassage we doubt how to translate _burh_, whether by _house_ or by\r\n_borough_, we are admitting that the language of the law does not\r\ndistinguish between the two. The Englishman's house is his castle, or,\r\nto use an older term, his _burh_; the king's borough is the king's\r\nhouse, for his house-peace prevails in its streets[735].\r\n\r\n[The town and the burh.]\r\n\r\nOur oldest laws seem to know no _burh_ other than the strong house of a\r\ngreat (but he need not be a very great) man. Early in the tenth century,\r\nhowever, the word had already acquired a new meaning. In Æthelstan's day\r\nit seems to be supposed by the legislator that a moot will usually be\r\nheld in a _burh_. If a man neglects three summonses to a moot, the\r\noldest men of the _burh_ are to ride to his place and seize his\r\ngoods[736]. Already a _burh_ will have many men in it. Some of them will\r\nbe elder-men, aldermen. A moot will be held in it. Very possibly this\r\nwill be the shire-moot, for, since there is riding to be done, we see\r\nthat the person who ought to have come to the moot may live at a\r\ndistance[737]. A little later the _burh_ certainly has a moot of its\r\nown. Edgar bids his subjects seek the _burh-gemót_ as well as the\r\n_scyr-gemót_ and the _hundred-gemót_. The borough-moot is to be held\r\nthrice a year[738]. At least from this time forward, the borough has a\r\ncourt. An important line is thus drawn between the borough and the mere\r\n_tún_. The borough has a court; the village has none, or, if the\r\nvillages are getting courts, this is due to the action of lords who\r\nhave sake and soke and is not commanded by national law. National law\r\ncommands that there shall be a moot thrice a year in every _burh_.\r\n\r\n[The building of boroughs.]\r\n\r\nThe extension of the term _burh_ from a fortified house to a fortified\r\ngroup of houses must be explained by those who are skilled in the\r\nhistory of military affairs. It is for them to tell us, for example, how\r\nmuch use the Angles and Saxons in the oldest days made of the entrenched\r\nhill-tops, and whether the walls of the Roman towns were continuously\r\nrepaired[739]. Howbeit, a time seems to have come, at latest in the\r\nstruggle between the Danish invaders and the West-Saxon kings, when the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of what we might call fortified towns was\r\nseen to be a matter of importance. There was to be a cluster of\r\ninhabited dwellings which as a whole was to be made defensible by ditch\r\nand mound, by palisade or wall. Edward the Elder and the Lady of the\r\nMercians were active in this work. Within the course of a few years\r\nburgs were 'wrought' or 'timbered' at Worcester, Chester, Hertford,\r\nWitham in Essex, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Eddisbury,\r\nWarbury, Runcorn, Buckingham, Towcester, Maldon, Huntingdon[740].\r\nWhatever may be meant by the duty of repairing burgs when it is\r\nmentioned in charters coming from a somewhat earlier time, it must for\r\nthe future be that of upholding those walls and mounds that the king and\r\nthe lady are rearing. The land was to be burdened with the maintenance\r\nof strongholds. The land, we say. That is the style of the land-books.\r\nLand, even though given to a church, is not to be free (unless by\r\nexceptional favour) of army-service, bridge-work and borough-bettering\r\nor borough-fastening. Wall-work[741] is coupled with bridge-work; to the\r\nduty of maintaining the county bridges is joined the duty of\r\nconstructing and repairing the boroughs. Shall we say the 'county\r\nboroughs'?\r\n\r\n[The shire and its borough.]\r\n\r\nLet us ask ourselves how the burden that is known as _burh-bót_, the\r\nduty that the Latin charters call _constructio_, _munitio_,\r\n_restauratio_, _defensio_, _arcis_ (for _arx_ is the common term) will\r\nreally be borne. Is it not highly probable, almost certain, that each\r\nparticular tract of land will be ascript to some particular _arx_ or\r\n_castellum_[742], and that if, for instance, there is but one _burh_ in\r\na shire, all the lands in that shire must help to better that _burh_.\r\nApportionment will very likely go further. The man with five hides will\r\nknow how much of the mound or the wall he must maintain, how much\r\n'wall-work' he must do. We see how the old bridge-work becomes a burden\r\non the estates of the county landowners. From century to century the\r\nCambridgeshire landowners contribute according to their hidage to repair\r\nthe most important bridge of their county, a bridge which lies in the\r\nmiddle of the borough of Cambridge. Newer arrangements, the rise of\r\ncastles and of borough communities, have relieved them from the duty of\r\n'borough-fastening;' but the bridge-work is apportioned on their lands.\r\n\r\n[Military geography.]\r\n\r\nThe exceedingly neat and artificial scheme of political geography that\r\nwe find in the midlands, in the country of the true 'shires,' forcibly\r\nsuggests deliberate delimitation for military purposes. Each shire is to\r\nhave its borough in its middle. Each shire takes its name from its\r\nborough. We must leave it for others to say in every particular case\r\nwhether and in what sense the shire is older than the borough or the\r\nborough than the shire: whether an old Roman chester was taken as a\r\ncentre or whether the struggles between Germanic tribes had fixed a\r\ncircumference. But a policy, a plan, there has been, and the outcome of\r\nit is that the shire maintains the borough[743].\r\n\r\nThere has come down to us in a sadly degenerate form a document which we\r\nshall hereafter call 'The Burghal Hidage[744].' It sets forth, so we\r\nbelieve, certain arrangements made early in the tenth century for the\r\ndefence of Wessex against Danish inroads. It names divers strongholds,\r\nand assigns to each a large number of hides. A few of the places that it\r\nmentions we have not yet found on the map. Beginning in the east of\r\nSussex and following the order of the list, we seem to see Hastings,\r\nLewes, Burpham (near Arundel), Chichester, Porchester, Southampton,\r\nWinchester, Wilton, Tisbury (or perhaps Chisenbury), Shaftesbury,\r\nTwyneham, Wareham, Bredy, Exeter, Halwell near Totness, Lidford,\r\nBarnstaple, Watchet, Axbridge; then Langport and Lyng (which defend the\r\nisle of Athelney), Bath, Malmesbury, Cricklade, Oxford, Wallingford,\r\nBuckingham, Eastling near Guildford, and Southwark. Corrupt and\r\nenigmatical though this catalogue may be, it is of the highest\r\nimportance. It shows how in the great age of burg-building the\r\nstrongholds had wide provinces which in some manner or another were\r\nappurtenant to them, and it may also give us some precious hints about\r\nplaces in Wessex which once were national burgs but which forfeited\r\ntheir burghal character in the tenth century. Guildford seems to have\r\nrisen at the expense of Eastling and Totness at the expense of Halwell,\r\nwhile Tisbury, Bredy and Watchet (if we are right in fancying that they\r\nare mentioned) soon lost caste. Lyng is not a place which we should have\r\nnamed among the oldest of England's burgs, and yet we have all read how\r\nAlfred wrought a 'work' at Athelney. In Wessex burgs rise and fall\r\nsomewhat rapidly. North of the Thames the system is more stable. Also it\r\nis more artificial, for north of the Thames civil and military geography\r\ncoincide.\r\n\r\n[The shire's wall-work.]\r\n\r\nLet us now look once more at the Oxford of Domesday Book. The king has\r\ntwenty 'mural houses[745]' which belonged to Earl Ælfgar; they pay\r\n13_s._ 2_d._ He has a house of 6_d._ which is constructively at Shipton;\r\none of 4_d._ at Bloxham; one of 30_d._ at Risborough and two of 4_d._ at\r\nTwyford in Buckinghamshire. 'They are called mural houses because, if\r\nthere be need and the king gives order, they shall repair the wall.'\r\nThere follows a list of the noble houseowners, an archbishop, six\r\nbishops, three earls and so forth. 'All the above hold these houses free\r\nbecause of the reparation of the wall. All the houses that are called\r\n\"mural\" were in King Edward's time free of everything except army\r\nservice and wall-work.' Then of Chester we read this[746]:--'To repair\r\nthe wall and the bridge, the reeve called out one man from every hide\r\nin the county, and the lord whose man did not come paid 40_s_. to the\r\nking and earl.' The duty of maintaining the bulwark of the county's\r\nborough is incumbent on the magnates of the county. They discharge it by\r\nkeeping haws in the borough and burgesses in those haws[747].\r\n\r\n[Henry the Fowler and the German burgs.]\r\n\r\nWe may doubt whether the duty of the county to its borough has gone no\r\nfarther than mere 'wall-work.' A tale from the older Saxony may come in\r\nwell at this point. When the German king Henry the Fowler was building\r\nburgs in Saxony and was playing the part that had lately been played in\r\nEngland by Edward and Æthelflæd, he chose, we are told, the ninth man\r\nfrom among the _agrarii milites_; these chosen men were to live in the\r\nburgs; they were to build dwellings there for their fellows\r\n(_confamiliares_) who were to remain in the country tilling the soil and\r\ncarrying a third of the produce to the burgs, and in these burgs all\r\n_concilia_ and _conventus_ and _convivia_ were to be held[748]. Modern\r\nhistorians have found in this story some difficulties which need not be\r\nnoticed here. Only the core of it interests us. Certain men are clubbed\r\ntogether into groups of nine for the purpose of maintaining the burg as\r\na garrisoned and victualled stronghold in which all will find room in\r\ncase a hostile inroad be made.\r\n\r\n[The shire thegns and their town houses.]\r\n\r\nTurning to England we shall not forget how in the year 894 Alfred\r\ndivided his forces into two halves; half were to take the field, half to\r\nremain at home, besides the men who were to hold the burgs[749]; but at\r\nall events we shall hardly go astray if we suggest that the thegns of\r\nthe shire have been bound to keep houses and retainers in the borough of\r\ntheir shire and that this duty has been apportioned among the great\r\nestates[750]. We find that the baron of Domesday Book has a few\r\nburgesses in the borough and that these few burgesses 'belong' in some\r\nsense or another to his various rural manors. Why should he keep a few\r\nburgesses in the borough and in what sense can these men belong some to\r\nthis manor and some to that? To all appearance this arrangement is not\r\nmodern. King Edmund conveyed to his thegn Æthelweard an estate of seven\r\nhides at Tistead in Hampshire and therewith the haws within the burg of\r\nWinchester that belonged to those seven hides[751]. When the Bishop of\r\nWorcester loaned out lands to his thegns, the lands carried with them\r\nhaws in the 'port' of Worcester[752]. We have all read of the ceorl who\r\n'throve to thegn-right.' He had five hides of his own land, a church and\r\na kitchen, a bell-tower and a _burh-geat-setl_, which, to our thinking,\r\nis just a house in the 'gate,' the street of the _burh_[753]. He did not\r\nacquire a town-house in order that he might enjoy the pleasures of the\r\ntown. He acquired it because, if he was to be one of the great men of\r\nthe county, he was bound to keep in the county's _burh_ retainers who\r\nwould do the wall-work and hoard provisions sent in to meet the evil day\r\nwhen all men would wish to be behind the walls of a _burh_.\r\n\r\n[The knights in the borough.]\r\n\r\nWe have it in our modern heads that the medieval borough is a sanctuary\r\nof peace, an oasis of 'industrialism' in the wilderness of 'militancy.'\r\nNow a sanctuary of peace the borough is from the very first. An\r\nexceptional and exalted peace reigns over it. If you break that peace\r\nyou incur the king's _burh-bryce_. But we may strongly suspect that the\r\nfirst burg-men, the first _burgenses_, were not an exceptionally\r\npeaceful folk. Those _burhwaras_ of London who thrashed Swegen[754] and\r\nchose kings were no sleek traders; nor must we speak contemptuously of\r\n'trained bands of apprentices' or of 'the civic militia.' In all\r\nprobability these burg-men were of all men in the realm the most\r\nprofessionally warlike. Were we to say that in the boroughs the knightly\r\nelement was strong we might mislead, for the word _knight_ has had\r\nchivalrous adventures. However, we may believe that the _burgensis_ of\r\nthe tenth century very often was a _cniht_, a great man's _cniht_, and\r\nthat if not exactly a professional soldier (professional militancy was\r\nbut beginning) he was kept in the borough for a military purpose and was\r\nperhaps being fed by the manor to which he belonged. These knights\r\nformed gilds for religious and convivial purposes. At Cambridge there\r\nwas a gild of thegns, who were united in blood-brotherhood. We can not\r\nbe certain that all these thegns habitually lived in Cambridge. Perhaps\r\nwe should rather say that already a Cambridgeshire club had its\r\nhead-quarters in Cambridge and there held its 'morning-speeches' and its\r\ndrinking bouts. These thegns had 'knights' who seem to have been in some\r\nsort inferior members of the gild and to have been bound by its\r\nrules[755]. Then we hear of 'knight-gilds' at London and Canterbury and\r\nWinchester[756]. Such gilds would be models for the merchant-gilds of\r\nafter-days, and indeed when not long after the Conquest we catch at\r\nCanterbury our first glimpse of a merchant-gild, its members are calling\r\nthemselves knights: knights of the chapman-gild[757]. Among the knights\r\nwho dwelt in the burg such voluntary societies were the more needful,\r\nbecause these men had not grown up together as members of a community.\r\nThey came from different districts and had different lords. In this\r\nheterogeneity we may also see one reason why a very stringent peace, the\r\nking's own house-peace, should be maintained, and why the borough should\r\nhave a moot of its own. When compared with a village there is something\r\nartificial about the borough.\r\n\r\n[_Buhr-bót_ and castle-guard.]\r\n\r\nThis artificiality exercised an influence over the later fate of the\r\nboroughs. The ground had been cleared for the growth of a new kind of\r\ncommunity, one whose members were not bound together by feudal,\r\nproprietary, agricultural ties. But the strand that we have been\r\nendeavouring to trace is broken at the Conquest. The castle arises. It\r\nis garrisoned by knights who are more heavily armed and more\r\nprofessionally militant than were their predecessors. The castle is now\r\nwhat wants defending; the knights who defend it form no part of the\r\nburghal community, and perhaps 'the castle fee' is in law no part of the\r\nborough. And yet let us see how in the twelfth century the king's castle\r\nat Norwich was manned. It was manned by the knights of the Abbot of St\r\nEdmund's. One troop served there for three months and then was relieved\r\nby another, and those who were thus set free went home to the manors\r\nwith which the abbot had enfeoffed them and which they held by the\r\nservice of castle-guard[758]. Much in this arrangement is new; the\r\ncastle itself is new; but it is no new thing, we take it, that the\r\n_burh_ should be garrisoned by the knights of abbots or earls. And who\r\nbuilt the castles, who built the Tower of London? Let us read what the\r\nchronicler says of the year 1097:--Also many shires which belonged to\r\nLondon for work[759] were sorely harassed by the wall that they wrought\r\naround the tower, and by the bridge, which had been nearly washed away,\r\nand by the work of the king's hall that was wrought at Westminster.\r\nThere were shires or districts which from of old owed this work or work\r\nof this kind to London-bury[760].\r\n\r\n[Borough and market.]\r\n\r\nLong before the Conquest, however, a force had begun to play which was\r\nto give to the boroughs their most permanent characteristic. They were\r\nto be centres of trade. We must not exclude the hypothesis that some\r\nplaces were fortified and converted into burgs because they were already\r\nthe focuses of such commerce as there was. But the general logic of the\r\nprocess we take to have been this:--The king's _burh_ enjoys a special\r\npeace: Even the men who are going to or coming from it are under royal\r\nprotection: Therefore within its walls men can meet together to buy and\r\nsell in safety: Also laws which are directed against theft command that\r\nmen shall not buy and sell elsewhere: Thus a market is established:\r\nTraders begin to build booths round the market-place and to live in the\r\nborough. A theory has indeed been brilliantly urged which would find the\r\nlegal germ of the borough rather in a market-peace than in the peace of\r\na burg[761]. But this doctrine has difficulties to meet. A market-peace\r\nis essentially temporary, while the borough's peace is eternal. A market\r\ncourt, if it arises, will have a jurisdiction only over bargains made\r\nand offences committed on market-days, whereas the borough court has a\r\ngeneral competence and hears pleas relating to the property in houses\r\nand lands. Here in England during the Angevin time the 'franchise,' or\r\nroyally granted right, of holding a market is quite distinct from the\r\nlegal essence of the borough. Lawful markets are held in many places\r\nthat are not boroughs; indeed in the end by calling a place 'a mere\r\nmarket-town' we should imply that it was no borough. Already in Domesday\r\nBook this seems to be the case. Markets are being held and market-tolls\r\nare being taken in many vills which are not of burghal rank[762].\r\nPerhaps also we may see the borough-peace and the market-peace lying\r\nside by side. In the Wallingford of the Confessor's day there were many\r\npersons who had sake and soke within their houses. If any one spilt\r\nblood and escaped into one of those houses before he was attached, the\r\nowner received the blood-wite. But it was not so on Saturdays, for then\r\nthe money went to the king 'because of the market[763].' Thus the king's\r\nborough-peace seems to be intensified on market-days; on those days it\r\nwill even penetrate the houses of the immunists. So at Dover some\r\nunwonted peace or 'truce' prevailed in the town from St. Michael's Day\r\nto St. Andrew's: that is to say, during the herring season[764].\r\n\r\n[Establishment of markets.]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a market is not one of those indefinite phenomena\r\nwhich the historian of law must make over to the historian of economic\r\nprocesses. It is a definite and a legal act. The market is established\r\nby law. It is established by law which prohibits men from buying and\r\nselling elsewhere than in a duly constituted market. To prevent an easy\r\ndisposal of stolen goods is the aim of this prohibition. Our\r\nlegislators are always thinking of the cattle-lifter. At times they seem\r\nto go the full length of decreeing that only in a 'port' may anything be\r\nbought or sold, unless it be of trifling value; but other dooms would\r\nalso sanction a purchase concluded before the hundred court. He who buys\r\nelsewhere runs a risk of being treated as a thief if he happens to buy\r\nstolen goods[765]. Official witnesses are to be appointed for this\r\npurpose in every hundred and in every _burh_: twelve in every hundred\r\nand small _burh_, thirty-three in a large _burh_[766]. Here once more we\r\nsee the _burh_ co-ordinated with the hundred. A by-motive favours this\r\nestablishment of markets. Those who traffic in the safety of the king's\r\n_burh_ may fairly be asked to pay some toll to the king. They enjoy his\r\npeace; perhaps also the use of royal weights and measures, known and\r\ntrustworthy, is another part of the valuable consideration that they\r\nreceive. First and last throughout the history of the boroughs toll is a\r\nmatter of importance[767]. It gives the king a revenue from the borough,\r\na revenue that he can let to farm. Also, though we do not think that the\r\nborough court was in its origin a mere market court, the disputes of the\r\nmarket-place will provide the borough court with plentiful litigation,\r\nand in this quarter also the king will find a new source of income.\r\nAmong the old land-books that which speaks most expressly of the profits\r\nof jurisdiction as the subject-matter of a gift is a charter which\r\nconcerns the town of Worcester. Æthelred and Æthelflæd, the ealdorman\r\nand lady of the Mercians, have, at the request of the bishop, built a\r\n_burh_ at Worcester, and they declare that of all the rights that\r\nappertain to their lordship both in market (_on ceapstowe_) and in\r\nstreet, within the _burh_ and without, they have given half to God and\r\nSt. Peter, with the witness of King Alfred and all the wise of Mercia.\r\nThe lord of the church is to have half of all, be it land-fee, or\r\nfiht-wite, stealing, wohceapung (fines for buying or selling contrary to\r\nthe rules of the market) or borough-wall-scotting[768]. Quite apart\r\nfrom the rent of houses, there is a revenue to be gained from the\r\nborough.\r\n\r\n[Moneyers in the burh.]\r\n\r\nAnother rule has helped to define the borough, and this rule also has\r\nits root among the regalia. No one, says King Æthelstan, is to coin\r\nmoney except in a port; in Canterbury there may be seven moneyers, four\r\nof the king, two of the bishop, one of the abbot; in Rochester three,\r\ntwo of the king, one of the bishop; in London-borough eight; in\r\nWinchester six; in Lewes two; in Hastings one; in Chichester one; in\r\nHampton two; in Wareham two; in Exeter two; in Shaftesbury two, and in\r\neach of the other boroughs one[769]. Already, then, a _burh_ is an\r\nentity known to the law: every _burh_ is to have its moneyer.\r\n\r\n[_Burh_ and _port_.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus to consider the _burh_ (1) as a stronghold, a place of\r\nrefuge, a military centre: (2) as a place which has a moot that is a\r\nunit in the general, national system of moots: (3) as a place in which a\r\nmarket is held. When in the laws this third feature is to be made\r\nprominent, the _burh_ is spoken of as a _port_, and perhaps from the\r\nfirst there might be a _port_ which was not a _burh_[770]. The word\r\n_port_ was applied to inland towns. To this usage of it the _portmoot_\r\nor _portmanmoot_ that in after days we may find in boroughs far from the\r\ncoast bears abiding testimony. On the other hand, except on the seaside,\r\nthis word has not become a part of many English place names[771]. If, as\r\nseems probable, it is the Latin _portus_, we apparently learn from the\r\nuse made of it that at one time the havens (and some of those havens may\r\nnot have been in England) were the only known spots where there was much\r\nbuying and selling. But be it remembered that a market-place, a\r\n_ceap-stow_, does not imply a resident population of buyers and\r\nsellers; it does not imply the existence of retailers[772].\r\n\r\n[Military and commercial elements in the borough.]\r\n\r\nWe can not analyse the borough population; we can not weigh the\r\ncommercial element implied by _port_ or the military element implied by\r\n_burh_; but to all seeming the former had been rapidly getting the upper\r\nhand during the century which preceded the making of Domesday Book. If\r\nwe are on the right track, there was a time when the thegns of the shire\r\nmust have regarded their borough haws rather as a burden than as a\r\nsource of revenue. They kept those haws because they were bound to keep\r\nthem. On the other hand, the barons of the Conqueror's day are deriving\r\nsome income from these houses. Often it is very small. Count Hugh, for\r\nexample, has just one burgess at Buckingham who pays him twenty-six\r\npence a year[773]. All too soon, it may be, had the boroughs put off\r\ntheir militancy. Had they retained it, England might never have been\r\nconquered. Houses which should have been occupied by 'knights,' were\r\noccupied by chapmen.\r\n\r\n[The borough and agriculture.]\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole difficulty. Even if we could closely watch the\r\nchange which substitutes a merchant or shopkeeper for a 'knight' as the\r\ntypical burg-man or burgess, we should still have to investigate an\r\nagrarian problem. Very likely we ought to think that even on the eve of\r\nthe Conquest the group of men which dwells within the walls is often a\r\ngroup which by tilling the soil produces a great part of its own food,\r\nthough some men may be living by handicraft or trade and some may still\r\nbe supported by those manors to which they 'belong.' In one case the\r\ninstitutions that are characteristic of _burh_ and _port_ may have been\r\nsuperimposed upon those of an ancient village which had common fields.\r\nIn another an almost uninhabited spot may have been chosen as the site\r\nfor a stronghold. In the former and, as we should fancy, the commoner\r\ncase a large choice is open to the constructive historian, for he may\r\nsuppose that the selected village was full of serfs or full of free\r\nproprietors, that the soil was royal demesne or had various landlords.\r\nIn one instance he may think that he sees the coalescence of several\r\nlittle communities that were once distinct; in another the gradual\r\noccupation of a space marked out by Roman walls. The one strong hint\r\nthat is given to us by Domesday Book and later documents is that our\r\ngeneralities should be few and that, were this possible, each borough\r\nshould be separately studied.\r\n\r\n[Burgesses as cultivators.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, quite half of the burgesses in any of those county towns that\r\nare fully described in the survey are the king's own burgesses, and in\r\nsome cases his share is very large. This suggests that the land on which\r\nthe borough stands has been royal land and that the king provided the\r\nshire thegns with sites for their haws. For their haws they have\r\nsometimes been paying him small rents. On the other hand, at Leicester,\r\nthough the king has some 40 houses, the great majority belong to Hugh of\r\nGrantmesnil. He has about 80 houses which pertain to 17 different manors\r\nand which may in the past have been held by many different thegns; but\r\nhe also holds 110 houses which are not allotted to manors and which have\r\nprobably come to him as the representative of the earls and ealdormen of\r\nan older time[774]. This looks as if in this case the soil had been not\r\nroyal but 'comital' land at the time when the place was fortified and\r\nwhen the landowners of the shire, including perhaps the king, were\r\nobliged to build houses within the wall. But though we fully admit that\r\neach of our boroughs has lived its own life, our evidence seems to point\r\nto the conclusion that in those truly ancient boroughs of which we have\r\nbeen speaking, though there might be many inhabitants who held and who\r\ncultivated arable land lying without the walls, there were from a remote\r\ntime other burgesses who were not landowners and were not\r\nagriculturists and yet were men of importance in the borough. If we\r\nlook, for example, at the elaborate account of Colchester we shall first\r\nread the names of the king's burgesses. 'Of these 276 burgesses of the\r\nking, the majority have one house and a plot of land of from one to\r\ntwenty-five acres; some possess more than one house and some have none;\r\nthey had in all 355 houses and held 1296 acres of land[775]'. But these\r\nwere not the only burgesses. Various magnates had houses which were\r\nannexed to their rural manors. Count Eustace (to name a few) had 12,\r\nGeoffrey de Mandeville 2, the Abbot of Westminster 4, the Abbess of\r\nBarking 3, and seemingly to these houses no strips in the arable fields\r\nwere attached[776]. Thus, though many of the burgesses may till the\r\nsoil, the borough community is not an agrarian community. We can not\r\ntreat it as a village community that has prospered and slowly changed\r\nits habits. A new principle has been introduced, an element of\r\nheterogeneity. The men who meet each other in court and market, the men\r\nwho will hereafter farm the court and market, are not the shareholders\r\nin an agricultural concern.\r\n\r\n[Burgage tenure.]\r\n\r\nThat tenurial heterogeneity of which we have been speaking had another\r\nimportant effect. When in later days a rural manor is being raised to\r\nthe rank of a _liber burgus_, the introduction of 'burgage tenure' seems\r\nto be regarded as the very essence of the enfranchisement[777]. Probably\r\nthis feature had appeared in many boroughs at an early date. The lord\r\nwith lands in Oxfordshire may have been bound to keep a few houses and\r\nretainers in Oxford. If, however, the commercial element in the town\r\nbegan to get the better of the military element, if Oxford became a\r\ncentre of trade, then a house in Oxford could be let for a money rent.\r\nIn Domesday Book the barons are drawing rents from their borough houses.\r\nIf any return is to be made by the occupier to the owner it will take\r\nthe form of a money rent; it can hardly take another form. Thus tenure\r\nat a money rent would become the typical tenure of a burgage tenement.\r\nIt will be a securely heritable tenure, because the landlord is an\r\nabsentee and has too few tenants in the town to require the care of a\r\nresident reeve. But there may have been many dwellers in some of the\r\nboroughs who were bound to help in the cultivation of a stretch of royal\r\nor episcopal demesne that lay close to the walls. In the west some of\r\nthe king's burgesses seem to have been holding under onerous terms. At\r\nShrewsbury, which lies near the border of Wales where every girl's\r\nmarriage gave rise to an _amobyr_, a maid had to pay ten, a widow twenty\r\nshillings when she took a husband, and a relief of ten shillings was due\r\nwhen a burgess died[778]. At Hereford the reeve's consent was necessary\r\nwhen a burgage was to be sold, and he took a third of the price. When a\r\nburgess died the king got his horse and arms (these Hereford burgesses\r\nwere fighting men); if he had no horse, then ten shillings 'or his land\r\nwith the houses.' Any one who was too poor to do his service might\r\nabandon his tenement to the reeve without having to pay for it. Such an\r\nentry as this seems to tell us that the services were no trivial return\r\nfor the tenement[779].\r\n\r\n[Eastern and western boroughs.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we may see at Stamford what seem to be the remains of\r\na very free group of settlers, presumably Danes. The town contains among\r\nother houses 77 houses of sokemen 'who hold their lands in demesne and\r\nseek lords wherever they please, and over whom the king has nothing but\r\nwite and heriot and toll.' These may be the same persons who hold 272\r\nacres of land and pay no rent for it[780]. At Norwich, again, we seem to\r\nhear of a time when the burgesses were free to commend themselves to\r\nwhomever they would, and were therefore living in houses which were all\r\ntheir own, and for which they paid no rent[781]. It is very possible\r\nthat, so far as landlordly rights are concerned, there was as much\r\ndifference between the eastern and the western towns as there was\r\nbetween the eastern and the western villages. Still if we look at\r\nborough after borough, tenure at a money rent is the tenure of the\r\nburgage houses that we expect to find, and such a tenure, even if in its\r\norigin it has been precarious, is likely to become heritable and\r\nsecure. As to the shire thegns, they have in some cases paid to the king\r\nsmall rents for their haws; but in others, for example at Oxford, tenure\r\nby wall-work has been their tenure, and when in other towns we find them\r\npaying rent to the king we may perhaps see commuted wall-work.\r\n\r\n[Common property of the burgesses.]\r\n\r\n[The community as landholders.]\r\n\r\nTraces are few in Domesday Book of any property that can be regarded as\r\nthe property of a nascent municipal corporation, and even of any that\r\ncan be called the joint or common property of the burgesses. In general\r\neach burgess holds his house in the town of the king or of some other\r\nlord by a several title, and, if he has land in the neighbouring fields,\r\nthis also he holds by a several title. 'In the borough of Nottingham\r\nthere were in King Edward's day 183 burgesses and 19 _villani_. To this\r\nborough belong 6 carucates of land for the king's geld and one meadow\r\nand certain small woods ... This land was divided between 38 burgesses\r\nand [the king] received 75_s_. 7_d_. from the rent of the land and the\r\nworks of the burgesses.' 'In the borough of Derby there were in King\r\nEdward's day 243 resident burgesses.... To this borough belong 12\r\ncarucates of land for the geld, but they might be ploughed by 8 teams.\r\nThis land was divided among 41 burgesses who had 12 teams[782].' In\r\nthese cases we see plainly enough that such arable land as is in any way\r\nconnected with the borough has been held by but a few out of the total\r\nnumber of the burgesses. Therefore we must deal cautiously with entries\r\nthat are less explicit. When, for example, in the description of\r\nStamford we read 'Lagemanni et burgenses habent cclxxii. acras sine omni\r\nconsuetudine[783],' we must not at once decide that there is any\r\nownership by the burgesses as a corporation, or any joint ownership, or\r\neven that all the burgesses have strips in these fields, though\r\napparently the burgesses who have strips pay no rent for them. This is\r\nthe fact and the only fact that the commissioners desire to record. They\r\ndo not care whether every burgess has a piece, or whether (as was\r\ncertainly the case elsewhere) only some of them held land outside the\r\nwalls. When of Norwich we read 'et in burgo tenent burgenses xliii.\r\ncapellas[784],' we do not suppose that all the Norwich burghers have\r\nchapels, still less that they hold the forty-three chapels as\r\nco-owners, still less that these chapels belong to a corporation. We\r\nremember that the Latin language has neither a definite nor an\r\nindefinite article. Therefore when of 80 acres at Canterbury, which are\r\nnow held by Ralph de Colombiers, we read 'quas tenebant burgenses in\r\nalodia de rege,' we need not suppose that these acres had belonged to\r\n_the_ (i.e. to all the) burgesses of Canterbury[785]. So of Exeter it is\r\nwritten: 'Burgenses Exoniae urbis habent extra civitatem terram xii.\r\ncaruc[arum] quae nullam consuetudinem reddunt nisi ad ipsam civitatem.'\r\nThis, though another interpretation is possible, may only mean that\r\nthere are outside the city twelve plough-lands which are held by\r\nburgesses whose rents go to make up that sum of £18 which is paid to the\r\nking, or rather in part to the sheriff and in part to the queen dowager,\r\nas the ferm of the city[786]. Concerning Colchester there is an entry\r\nwhich perhaps ascribes to the community of burgesses the ownership or\r\nthe tenancy of fourscore acres of land and of a strip eight perches in\r\nwidth surrounding the town wall; but this entry is exceedingly\r\nobscure[787]. Another dark case occurs at Canterbury. We are told that\r\nthe burgesses or certain burgesses used to hold land of the king 'in\r\ntheir gild[788].' Along with this we must read another passage which\r\nstates how in the same city the Archbishop has twelve burgesses and\r\nthirty-two houses which 'the clerks of the vill hold in their gild.'\r\nApparently in this last case we have a clerical club or fraternity\r\nholding land, and the burgher's gild may be of much the same nature, a\r\nvoluntary association. Not very long after the date of Domesday, for\r\nAnselm was still alive, an exchange of lands was made between the\r\nconvent (_hired_, _familia_) of Christ Church and the 'cnihts' of the\r\nchapman gild of Canterbury. The transaction takes place between the\r\n'hired' on the one hand, the 'heap' (for such is the word employed) on\r\nthe other. The witnesses to this transaction are Archbishop Anselm and\r\nthe 'hired' on the one hand, Calveal the portreeve and 'the eldest men\r\nof the heap' on the other[789]. But to see a municipal corporation in\r\nthe burghers' gild of Domesday Book would be very rash. We do not know\r\nthat all the burghers belonged to it or that it had any governmental\r\nfunctions[790].\r\n\r\n[Rights of common.]\r\n\r\nWe may of course find that a group of burgesses has 'rights of common;'\r\nbut rights of common, though they are rights which are to be enjoyed in\r\ncommon, are apt to be common rights in no other sense, for each commoner\r\nhas a several title to send his beasts onto the pasture. Thus 'all the\r\nburgesses of Oxford have pasture in common outside the wall which brings\r\nin [to the king] 6_s._ 8_d[791]._' The soil is the king's; the burgesses\r\npay for the right of grazing it. The roundness of the sum that they pay\r\nseems indeed to hint at some arrangement between the king and the\r\nburgesses taken in mass; but probably each burgess, and the lord of each\r\nburgess, regards a right of pasture as appurtenant to a burgage\r\ntenement. The case is striking, for we have seen how heterogeneous a\r\ngroup these Oxford burgesses were[792]. No less than nine prelates, to\r\nsay nothing of earls and barons, had burgesses in the city. We must\r\ngreatly doubt whether there is any power in any assembly of the\r\nburgesses to take from the Bishop of Winchester or the Count of Mortain\r\nthe customary rights of pasture that have been enjoyed by the tenants of\r\nhis tenements.\r\n\r\n[Absence of communalism in the boroughs.]\r\n\r\nWe might perhaps have guessed that the boroughs would be the places of\r\nall others in which such communalism as there was in the ancient village\r\ncommunity would maintain and develop itself, until in course of time the\r\nborough corporation, the ideal borough, would stand out as the owner of\r\nlands which lay within and without the wall. But, if we have not been\r\ngoing astray, we may see why this did not happen, at least in what we\r\nmay call the old national boroughs. The burgensic group was not\r\nhomogeneous enough. We may suppose that some members of it had inherited\r\narable strips and pasture rights from the original settlers; but others\r\nwere 'knights' who had been placed in the haws of the shire-thegns, or\r\nwere merchants and craftsmen who had been attracted by the market, and\r\nfor them there would be no room in an old agrarian scheme. Indeed it is\r\nnot improbable that, even as regards rights of pasture, there was more\r\ndifference between burgess and burgess than there was between villager\r\nand villager. In modern times it is not unknown that some of the\r\nburgesses will have pasture rights, while others will have none, and in\r\nthose who are thus favoured we may fancy that we see the successors in\r\ntitle of the king's tenants who turned out their beasts on the king's\r\nland[793].\r\n\r\n[The borough community and its lord.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the boroughs a group of men is formed whose\r\nprinciple of cohesion is not to be found in land tenure. The definition\r\nof a burgess may involve the possession of a house within or hard by the\r\nwalls; but the burgesses do not coalesce as being the tenants or the men\r\nof one lord; and yet coalesce they will. They are united in and by the\r\nmoot and the market-place, united under the king in whose peace they\r\ntraffic; and then they are soon united over against the king, who exacts\r\ntoll from them and has favours to grant them. They aspire to farm their\r\nown tolls, to manage their own market and their own court. The king's\r\nrights are pecuniary rights; he is entitled to collect numerous small\r\nsums. Instead of these he may be willing to take a fixed sum every year,\r\nor, in other words, to let his rights to farm.\r\n\r\n[The farm of the borough.]\r\n\r\nThis step seems to have been very generally taken before the Conquest.\r\nAlready the boroughs were farmed. Now the sums which the king would draw\r\nfrom a borough would be of several different kinds. In the first place,\r\nthere would be the profits of the market and of the borough court. In\r\nthe second place, there would be the gafol, the 'haw-gavel' and\r\n'land-gavel' arising from tenements belonging to the king and occupied\r\nby burgesses. In the third place, there might be the danegeld; but the\r\ndanegeld was a tax, an occasional tax, and for the moment we may leave\r\nit out of our consideration. Now the profits of the market and court\r\nseem to have been farmed. The sums that they bring in to the king are\r\nround sums. The farmer seems to have been the sheriff or in some cases\r\nthe king's portreeve. We can find no case in which it is absolutely\r\nclear to our minds that the borough itself, the _communitas burgi_, is\r\nreckoned to be the king's farmer. Again, the king's gafol, that is his\r\nburgage rents, may be farmed: they are computed at a round sum. Thus at\r\nHuntingdon ten pounds are paid by way of land-gafol, and we may be\r\nfairly certain that the sum of the rents of the individual burgesses who\r\nheld their tenements immediately of the king (there were other burgesses\r\nwho belonged to the Abbot of Ramsey) did not exactly make up this neat\r\nsum[794]. In this case, however, the sum due to the king from his\r\nfarmer, probably the sheriff, in respect of the land-gafol is expressly\r\ndistinguished from the sum that he has to pay for the farm of the\r\nborough (_firma burgi_):--at least in its narrowest sense, the _burgus_\r\nwhich is farmed is not a mass of lands and houses, it is a market and a\r\ncourt[795]. But, though we find no case in which the community of the\r\nborough is unambiguously treated as the king's farmer, there are cases\r\nin which it seems to come before us as the sheriff's farmer. 'The\r\nburgesses' of Northampton pay to the sheriff £30. 10_s._ per\r\nannum:--'this belongs to his farm[796].' The sheriff of Northamptonshire\r\nis liable to the king for a round sum as the farm of the shire, but\r\n'the burgesses' of Northampton are liable to the sheriff for a round\r\nsum. This may mean that for this round sum they are jointly and\r\nseverally liable, while, on the other hand, they collect the tolls and\r\nfines, perhaps also the king's burgage rents, and have an opportunity of\r\nmaking profit by the transaction.\r\n\r\n[The sheriff and the borough's farm.]\r\n\r\nWe must not be in haste to expel the sheriff from the boroughs of the\r\nshire, or to bring the burgesses into immediate contact with the king's\r\ntreasury. We must remember that at the beginning of Henry II.'s reign\r\nthere is scarcely an exception to the rule that the boroughs of the\r\nshire are in the eyes of auditors at the Exchequer simply parts of that\r\ncounty which the sheriff farms. So far as the farm is concerned, the\r\nroyal treasury knows nothing of any boroughs[797]. The sheriff of\r\nGloucestershire, for example, accounts for a round sum which is the farm\r\nof his county; neither he nor any one else accounts to the king for any\r\nfarm of the borough of Gloucester. If, as is most probable, the borough\r\nis being farmed, it is being farmed by some person or persons to whom,\r\nnot the king, but the sheriff has let it for a longer or shorter period\r\nat a fixed rent. Here, again, we see the likeness between a borough and\r\na hundred. The king lets the shire to farm; the shire includes hundreds\r\nand boroughs; the sheriff 'lets the hundreds to farm; the sheriff lets\r\nthe boroughs to farm.' A few years later a new arrangement is made. The\r\nking begins to let the borough of Gloucester to farm. A sum of £50\r\n(blanch) is now deducted from the rent that the sheriff has been paying\r\nfor his shire, and, on the other hand, Osmund the reeve accounts for\r\n£55, which is the rent of the borough. We must not antedate a change\r\nwhich is taking place very gradually in the middle of the twelfth\r\ncentury. Nor must we at once reject the inference that, as the bailiffs\r\nto whom the sheriff lets the hundreds are chosen by him, so also the\r\nbailiffs or portreeves to whom he lets the boroughs are or have been\r\nchosen by him. It seems very possible that one of the first steps\r\ntowards independence that a borough takes is that its burgesses induce\r\nthe sheriff to accept their nominee as his farmer of the town if they in\r\nmass will make themselves jointly and severally liable for the rent.\r\nThese movements take place in the dark and we can not date them; but to\r\nantedate them would be easy.\r\n\r\n[The community and the geld.]\r\n\r\nWe also see that the 'geld' that the borough has to pay is a round sum\r\nthat remains constant from year to year. Cambridge, for example, is\r\nassessed at a hundred hides, Bedford at half a hundred[798]. Now we have\r\ngood reason to believe that, in the open country also, a round sum of\r\ngeld or (and this is the same thing) a round number of hides had been\r\nthrown upon the hundreds, that the sum thrown upon a hundred was then\r\npartitioned among the vills, and that the sum thrown upon a vill was\r\npartitioned among the persons who held land in the vill. In the open\r\ncountry, however, when once the partition had been made, the number of\r\nhides that was cast upon the land of any one proprietor seems to have\r\nbeen fixed for good and all[799]. If we suppose, for example, that a\r\nvill had been assessed at ten hides and that five of those units had\r\nbeen assigned to a certain Edward, then Edward or his successors in\r\ntitle would always have to pay for five hides, and would have to pay for\r\nno more although the other proprietors in the vill obtained an exemption\r\nfrom the tax or were insolvent. In short, the tax though originally\r\ndistributed by a partitionary method was not repartitionable. On the\r\nother hand, in the boroughs a more communal arrangement seems to have\r\nprevailed. In some sense or another, the whole borough, no matter what\r\nits fortunes might be, remained answerable for the twenty, fifty or a\r\nhundred hides that had been imposed upon it. Such a difference would\r\nnaturally arise. In the open country the taxational hidation was\r\nsupposed to represent and did represent, albeit rudely, a state of facts\r\nthat had once existed. The man who was charged with a hide ought in\r\ntruth to have had one of those agrarian units that were commonly known\r\nas hides. But when a borough was charged with hides, a method of\r\ntaxation that was adapted to and suggested by rural arrangements was\r\nbeing inappropriately applied to what had become or would soon become\r\nan urban district. Thus the gross sum that is cast upon the borough does\r\nnot split itself once and for all into many small sums each of which\r\ntakes root in a particular tenement. The whole sum is exigible from the\r\nwhole borough every time a geld is imposed. It is repartitionable.\r\n\r\n[Partition of taxes.]\r\n\r\nFor all this, however, we must be careful not to see more communalism or\r\nmore local self-government than really exists. At first sight we may\r\nthink that we detect a communal or a joint liability of all the\r\nburgesses for the whole sum that is due from the borough in any one\r\nyear. 'The English born' burgesses of Shrewsbury send up a piteous\r\nwail[800]. They still have to pay the whole geld as they paid it in the\r\nConfessor's day, although the earl has taken for his castle the sites of\r\nfifty-one houses, and other fifty houses are waste, and forty-three\r\nFrench burgesses hold houses which used to pay geld, and the earl has\r\ngiven to the abbey, which he has founded, thirty-nine burgesses who used\r\nto pay geld along with the others. But, when we examine the matter more\r\nclosely, we may doubt whether there is here any joint and several (to\r\nsay nothing of any corporate) liability. Very various are the modes in\r\nwhich a land-tax or house-tax may be assessed and levied. Suppose a tax\r\nof £100 imposed upon a certain district in which there are a hundred\r\nhouses. Suppose it also to be law that, though some of these houses come\r\nto the hands of elemosynary corporations (which we will imagine to enjoy\r\nan immunity from taxation) still the whole £100 must be raised annually\r\nfrom the householders of the district. For all this, we have not as yet\r\ndecided that any householder will ever be liable, even in the first\r\ninstance, for more than his own particular share of the £100. A\r\nreadjustment of taxation there must be. It may take one of many forms.\r\nThere may be a revaluation of the district, and the £100 may be newly\r\napportioned by some meeting of householders or some government officer.\r\nBut, again, the readjustment may be automatic. Formerly there were 100\r\nhouses to pay £100. Now there are 90 houses to pay £100. That each of\r\nthe 90 must pay ten-ninths of a pound is a conclusion that the rule of\r\nthree draws for us. In the middle ages an automatic readjustment was all\r\nthe easier because of the common assumption that the value of lands and\r\nhouses was known to every one and that one virgate in a manor was as\r\ngood as another, one 'haw' in a borough as good as another[801]. We do\r\nnot say that the complaint of the burgesses at Shrewsbury points to no\r\nmore than an automatic readjustment of taxation which all along has been\r\na taxation of individuals; still the warning is needful that the\r\nexaction at regular or irregular intervals of a fixed amount from a\r\ndistrict, or from the householders or inhabitants of a district, an\r\namount which remains constant though certain portions of the district\r\nobtain immunity from the impost, does not of necessity point to any kind\r\nof liability that is not the liability of one single individual for\r\nspecific sums which he and he only has to pay; nor does it of necessity\r\npoint to any self-governing or self-assessing assembly of\r\ninhabitants[802].\r\n\r\n[No corporation implied by the farming of the borough.]\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to the case of Northampton, it certainly seems to\r\ntell us of a composition, not indeed between the burgesses and the king,\r\nbut between the burgesses and the sheriff. 'The burgesses of Northampton\r\npay to the sheriff £30. 10_s._' We may believe that 'the burgesses' who\r\npay this sum have a chance of making a profit. If so, 'the burgesses'\r\nare already beginning to farm 'the borough.' From this, nevertheless, we\r\nmust not leap to corporate liability or corporate property. Very likely\r\nthe sheriff regards every burgess of Northampton as liable to him for\r\nthe whole £30. 10_s._; very certainly, as we think, he does not look for\r\npayment merely to property which belongs, not to any individual burgess\r\nnor to any sum of individual burgesses, but to 'the borough' of\r\nNorthampton. Nor if the burgesses make profit out of tolls and fines,\r\ndoes it follow that they have a permanent common purse; they may divide\r\nthe surplus every year[803], or we may suspect them of drinking the\r\nprofits as soon as they are made.\r\n\r\n[Borough and county organization.]\r\n\r\nEntries which describe the limits that are set to the duty of military\r\nor of naval service may seem more eloquent. Thus of Dover we are told\r\nthat the burgesses used to supply twenty ships for fifteen days in the\r\nyear with twenty-one men in each ship, and that they did this because\r\nthe king had released to them his sake and soke[804]. Here we seem to\r\nread of a definite transaction between the king of the one part and the\r\nborough of the other part, and one which implies a good deal of\r\ngovernmental organization in the borough. We would say nothing to lessen\r\nthe just force of such a passage, which does not stand alone[805]; but\r\nstill there need be but little more organization in the borough of Dover\r\nthan there is in Berkshire. It was the custom of that county that, when\r\nthe king summoned his host, only one soldier went from every five hides,\r\nwhile each hide provided him with four shillings for his equipment and\r\nwages[806]. We may guess that in a county such a scheme very rapidly\r\n'realized' itself and took root in the soil, that in a borough there was\r\nless 'realism,' that there were more frequent readjustments of the\r\nburden; but the difference is a difference of degree.\r\n\r\n[Government of the boroughs.]\r\n\r\nOf anything that could be called the constitution of the boroughs, next\r\nto nothing can we learn. We may take it that in most cases the king's\r\nfarmer was the sheriff of the shire; in some few cases, as for example\r\nat Hereford, the reeve of the borough may have been directly accountable\r\nto the king[807]. We know no proof that in any case the reeve was an\r\nelected officer. Probably in each borough a court was held which was a\r\ncourt for the borough; probably it was, at least as a general rule,\r\nco-ordinate with a hundred court, and indeed at starting the borough\r\nseems to be regarded as a vill which is also a hundred[808]. The action\r\nof this court, however, like the action of other hundred courts, must as\r\ntime went on have been hampered by the growth of seignorial justice. The\r\nsake and soke which a lord might have over his men and over his lands\r\nwere certainly not excluded by the borough walls. He had sometimes been\r\nexpressly told that he might enjoy these rights 'within borough and\r\nwithout borough.' It is difficult for us to realize the exact meaning\r\nthat 'sake and soke' would bear when ascribed to a prelate or thegn who\r\nhad but two or three houses within the town. Perhaps in such cases the\r\ntown houses were for jurisdictional purposes deemed to be situate within\r\nsome rural manor of their lord. But in a borough a lord might have a\r\ncompact group of tenants quite large enough to form a petty court. In\r\nsuch a case the borough court would have the seignorial courts as\r\nrivals, and many a dispute would there be. At Lincoln one Tochi had a\r\nhall which undoubtedly was free 'from all custom'; but he had also\r\nthirty houses over which the king had toll and forfeiture. So the\r\nburgesses swore; but a certain priest was ready to prove by ordeal that\r\nthey swore falsely[809]. In these cases the lord's territory would\r\nappear in later times as a little 'liberty' lying within the borough\r\nwalls. The middle ages were far spent before such liberties had become\r\nmere petty nuisances[810]. In the old cathedral towns, such as\r\nCanterbury and Winchester, the bishop's jurisdictional powers and\r\nimmunities were serious affairs, for the bishop's tenants were\r\nnumerous[811]. Nevertheless, in the great and ancient boroughs, the\r\nboroughs which stand out as types and models, there was from a very\r\nremote time a court, a borough-moot or portman-moot, which was not\r\nseignorial, a court which was a unit in a national system of courts.\r\n\r\n[The borough court.]\r\n\r\nOf the form that the borough court took we can say little. Perhaps at\r\nfirst it would be an assembly of all the free burg-men or port-men. As\r\nits business increased in the large boroughs, as it began to sit once a\r\nweek instead of thrice a year, a set of persons bound to serve as\r\ndoomsmen may have been formed, a set of aldermen or lawmen whose offices\r\nmight or might not be hereditary, might or might not 'run with' the\r\npossession of certain specific tenements. A 'husting' might be formed,\r\nthat is, a house-thing as distinct from a 'thing' or court held in the\r\nopen air. Law required that there should be standing witnesses in a\r\nborough, before whom bargains and sales should take place. Such a demand\r\nmight hasten the formation of a small body of doomsmen. In Cambridge\r\nthere were lawmen of thegnly rank[812]; in Lincoln there were twelve\r\nlawmen[813]; in Stamford there had been twelve, though at the date of\r\nDomesday Book there were but nine[814]; we read of four _iudices_ in\r\nYork[815], and of twelve _iudices_ in Chester[816]. So late as 1275 the\r\ntwelve lawmen of Stamford lived on in the persons of their heirs or\r\nsuccessors. There are, said a jury, twelve men in Stamford who are\r\ncalled lawmen because their ancestors were in old time the judges of the\r\nlaws (_iudices legum_) in the said town; they hold of the king in chief;\r\nby what service we do not know; but you can find out from Domesday\r\nBook[817]. Over the bodies of these, presumably Danish, lawmen there has\r\nbeen much disputation. We know that taken individually the lawmen of\r\nLincoln were holders of heritable franchises, of sake and soke. We know\r\nthat among the twelve _iudices_ of Chester were men of the king, men of\r\nthe earl, men of the bishop; they had to attend the 'hundred,' that is,\r\nwe take it, the borough court. We know no more; but it seems likely that\r\nwe have to deal with persons who collectively form a group of doomsmen,\r\nwhile individually each of them is a great man, of thegnly rank, with\r\nsake and soke over his men and his lands; his office passes to his\r\nheir[818]. On the whole, however, we must doubt whether the generality\r\nof English boroughs had arrived at even this somewhat rudimentary stage\r\nof organization. In 1200 the men of Ipswich, having received a charter\r\nfrom King John, decided that there should be in their borough twelve\r\nchief portmen, 'as there were in the other free boroughs in England,'\r\nwho should have full power to govern and maintain the town and to render\r\nthe judgments of its court[819]. Now Ipswich has a right to be placed in\r\nthe class of ancient boroughs, of county towns, and yet to all\r\nappearance it had no definite class of chief men or doomsmen until the\r\nyear 1200. Still we ought not to infer from this that the town moot had\r\nbeen in practice a democratic institution. There may be a great deal of\r\noligarchy, and oligarchy of an oppressive kind, though the ruling class\r\nhas never been defined by law. Domesday Book allows us to see in various\r\ntowns a large number of poor folk who can not pay taxes or can only pay\r\na poll tax. We must be chary of conceding to this crowd any share in the\r\ndooms of the court[820].\r\n\r\n[Definition of the borough.]\r\n\r\nBut what concerns the government of the boroughs has for the time been\r\nsufficiently said by others. In our few last words we will return to our\r\nfirst theme, the difference between the borough and the mere township.\r\n\r\n[Mediatized boroughs.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Domesday Book a prominent position is conceded to\r\ncertain towns. They are not brought under any rubric which would place\r\nthem upon the king's or any other person's land. It must now be\r\nconfessed that there are some other towns that are not thus treated and\r\nthat none the less are called boroughs. If, however, we remember that\r\nburgesses often are in law where they are not in fact, the list that we\r\nshall make of these boroughs will not be long. Still such boroughs exist\r\nand a few words should be said about them. They seem to fall into two\r\nclasses, for they are described as being on the king's land or on the\r\nland of some noble or prelate. Of the latter class we will speak first.\r\nIt does not contain many members and in some cases we can be certain\r\nthat in the Confessor's day the borough in question had no other lord\r\nthan the king. Totness is a case in point. It now falls under the title\r\n_Terra Judhel de Tottenais_; but we are told that King Edward held it in\r\ndemesne[821]. In Sussex we see that Steyning, Pevensey and Lewes are\r\ncalled _burgi_[822], Steyning is placed on the land of the Abbot of\r\nFécamp, Pevensey on that of the Count of Mortain and Lewes on that of\r\nWilliam of Warenne; but at Lewes there have been many haws appurtenant\r\nto the rural manors of the shire thegns[823]. In Kent the borough of\r\nHythe seems to be completely under the archbishop[824]. He has burgesses\r\nat Romney over whom he has justiciary rights, but they serve the\r\nking[825]. The 'little borough called Fordwich' belonged to the Abbot of\r\nSt Augustin. But of this we know the history. The Confessor gave him\r\nthe royal two-thirds, while the bishop of Bayeux as the successor of\r\nEarl Godwin gave him the comital one-third[826]. Further north, Louth in\r\nLincolnshire and Newark in Nottinghamshire seem to be accounted\r\nboroughs; they both belong to the bishop of Lincoln; but in the case of\r\nNewark (which was probably an old _burh_) we may doubt whether his title\r\nis very ancient[827]. We are told that at Tatteshall, the Pontefract of\r\nlater days[828], there are sixty 'minute burgesses,' that is, we take\r\nit, burgesses in a small way. Ilbert de Lacy is now their lord; but here\r\nagain we may suspect a recent act of mediatization[829]. Grantham in\r\nLincolnshire is placed on the Terra Regis; it had belonged to Queen\r\nEdith; there were, however, seventy-seven tofts in it which belonged to\r\n'the sokemen of the thegns,' that is, to the sokemen of the thegns of\r\nthe shire[830]. Then in Suffolk we see that Ipswich is described at the\r\nend of the section which deals with the royal estates; a similar place\r\nis found for Norwich, Yarmouth and Thetford in the survey of\r\nNorfolk[831]. But for Dunwich we must look elsewhere. There were\r\nburgesses at Dunwich; but to all seeming the royal rights over the town\r\nhad passed into the hands of Eadric of Laxfield[832]. The successor of\r\nthe same Eadric has burgesses among his tenants at Eye[833]. There are\r\nburgesses at Clare, though Clare belongs altogether to the progenitor of\r\nthe lordly race which will take its name from this little town[834]. But\r\nat least in this last case, the burgesses may be new-comers, or rather\r\nperhaps we may see that an old idea is giving way to a newer idea of a\r\nborough, and that if men engaged in trade or handicraft settle round a\r\nmarket-place and pay money-rents to a lord they will be called\r\nburgesses, though the town is no national fortress. At Berkhampstead 52\r\nburgesses are collected in a _burbium_, but they may be as new as the\r\ntwo _arpents_ of vineyard[835]. We must not say dogmatically that never\r\nin the days before the Conquest had a village become a borough while it\r\nhad for its one and only landlord some person other than the king, some\r\nbishop, or some thegn. This may have happened at Taunton. In 1086 there\r\nwere burgesses at Taunton and it enjoyed 'burh-riht,' and yet from a\r\nvery remote time it had belonged to the bishops of Winchester. But the\r\ncases in which we may suppose that a village in private hands became a\r\n_burgus_ and that this change took place before the Norman invasion seem\r\nto be extremely few. In these few the cause of the change may have been\r\nthat the king by way of special favour imposed his _burhgrið_ upon the\r\ntown and thereby augmented the revenue of its lord[836].\r\n\r\n[Boroughs on the king's land.]\r\n\r\nAs to the boroughs that are regarded as standing on the king's land,\r\nthese also seem to be few and for the more part they are small. There\r\nare burgesses at Maldon[837]; but Maldon is not placed by the side of\r\nColchester[838]; it is described among the royal estates. There are\r\nburgesses at Bristol[839]; but Bristol is not placed beside Gloucester\r\nand Winchcombe. Perhaps we should have heard more of it, if it had not,\r\nlike Tamworth, stood on the border of two counties. In the south-west\r\nthe king's officials seem to be grappling with difficulties as best they\r\nmay. In Dorset they place Dorchester, Bridport, Wareham and Shaftesbury\r\nabove the rubric _Terra Regis_[840], and we can not find that they\r\nreckon any other place as a borough. In Devonshire we see Exeter above\r\nthe line; Lidford and Barnstaple, however, are called boroughs though\r\nthey are assigned to the king's land, and (as already said) Totness is a\r\nborough, though it is mediatized and is described among the estates of\r\nits Breton lord[841]. No borough in Somerset is placed above the line,\r\nthough we learn that the king has 107 burgesses in Ilchester who pay him\r\n20 shillings[842], and that he and others have burgesses at Bath[843].\r\nPerhaps the space that stands vacant before the list of the tenants in\r\nchief should have been filled with some words about these two towns.\r\nAxbridge, Langport and Milborne seem to be boroughs; Axbridge and\r\nLangport occur in that list of ancient fortresses which we have called\r\nThe Burghal Hidage[844]. Wells was an episcopal, Somerton a royal manor;\r\nwe have no reason for calling either of them a borough. In Hampshire\r\nanother of the ancient fortresses, Twyneham (the modern Christ Church)\r\nis still called _burgus_, but seems to be finding its level among the\r\nroyal manors[845]. In Wiltshire Malmesbury and Marlborough are placed\r\nabove the line. We learn that the king receives £50 from the _burgus_ of\r\nWilton[846], and we also learn incidentally that various lords have\r\nburgesses in that town; for example, the bishop of Salisbury has\r\nburgesses in Wilton who belong to his manor of Salisbury[847]. Old\r\nSalisbury ('old Sarum' as we foolishly call it) seems to be a mere\r\nmanor belonging to the bishop; but the king receives its third penny.\r\nHe receives also the third penny of Cricklade, which we have named\r\nbefore now as one of the old Wessex strongholds, and several of the\r\ncounty magnates had burgesses there. On the other hand Calne, Bedwind\r\nand Warminster are reckoned to be manors on the king's land. Burgesses\r\nbelong to them; but whether those burgesses are really resident in them\r\nmay not be quite certain[848]. Devizes we can not find. That puzzles\r\nshould occur in this quarter is what our general theory might lead us to\r\nexpect. In the old home of the West-Saxon kings there may well have been\r\ntowns which had long ago secured the name and the peace of royal burgs,\r\nthough they manifested none of that tenurial heterogeneity which is the\r\ncommon mark of a borough. A town, a village, which not only belonged to\r\nthe king but contained a palace or house in which he often dwelt, would\r\nenjoy his special peace, and might maintain its burghal dignity long\r\nafter there was little, if any, real difference between it and other\r\nmanors or villages of which the king was the immediate landlord. Already\r\nin 1086 there may have been 'rotten boroughs,' boroughs that were rotten\r\nbefore they were ripe[849].\r\n\r\n[Attributes of the borough.]\r\n\r\nA borough belongs to the genus _villa_ (_tún_). In age after age our\r\ntask is to discover its _differentia_, and the task is hard because, as\r\nage succeeds age, changes in law and changes in fact are making the old\r\ndistinctions obsolete while others are becoming important. Let us\r\nobserve, then, that already when Domesday Book was in the making those\r\nancient attributes of which we have been speaking were disappearing or\r\nwere fated soon to disappear. We have thought of the typical borough as\r\na fortified town maintained by a district for military purposes. But\r\nalready the shire thegns have been letting their haws at a rent and\r\nprobably have been letting them to craftsmen and traders. Also the time\r\nhas come for knight-service and castles and castle-guard. We have\r\nthought of the typical borough as the sphere of a special peace. But the\r\nday is at hand when a revolution in the criminal law will destroy the\r\nold system of _wer_ and _wíte_ and _bót_, and the king's peace will\r\nreign always and everywhere[850]. We have thought of the typical borough\r\nas a town which has a court. But the day is at hand when almost every\r\nvillage will have its court, its manorial court. New contrasts, however,\r\nare emerging as the old contrasts fade away. Against a background of\r\nvilleinage and week-work, the borough begins to stand out as the scene\r\nof burgage tenure. The service by which the burgess holds his tenement\r\nis a money rent. This may lead to a large increase in the number of\r\nboroughs. If a lord enfranchises a manor, abolishes villein customs,\r\ntakes money rents, allows his tenants to farm the court and perhaps also\r\nto farm a market that he has acquired from the king, he will be said to\r\ncreate a _liber burgus_[851]. Merchant gilds, elected bailiffs, elected\r\nmayors and common seals will appear and will complicate the question.\r\nThere will follow a time of uncertainty and confusion when the sheriffs\r\nwill decide as suits them best which of the smaller towns are boroughs\r\nand which are not.\r\n\r\n[Classification of boroughs.]\r\n\r\nIf the theory that we have been suggesting is true, all or very nearly\r\nall our ancient boroughs (and we will draw the line of ancientry at the\r\nConquest) are in their inception royal boroughs. The group of burgesses\r\nwhen taken as a whole had no superior other than the king. His was the\r\npeace that prevailed in the streets; the profits of the court and of the\r\nmarket were his, though they were farmed by a reeve. Rarely, however,\r\nwas he the landlord of all the burgesses. In general not a few of them\r\nlived in houses that belonged to the thegns of the shire. We must be\r\ncareful therefore before we speak of these towns as 'boroughs on the\r\nroyal demesne.' For the more part, the compilers of Domesday Book have\r\nrefused to place them on the _Terra Regis_. In course of time some of\r\nthem will be currently spoken of as boroughs on or of the royal demesne.\r\nThe rights of those who represent the thegns of the shire will have\r\nbecome mere rights to rent, and, their origin being forgotten, they will\r\neven be treated as mere rent-charges[852]. The great majority of the\r\nburgesses will in many instances be the king's immediate tenants and he\r\nwill be the only lord of that incorporeal thing, 'the borough,' the only\r\nman who can grant it a charter or let it to farm. But we must\r\ndistinguish between these towns and those which at the Conquest were\r\nmanors on the king's land. These latter, if he enfranchises them, will\r\nbe boroughs on the royal demesne in an exacter sense. So, again, we must\r\ndistinguish between those ancient boroughs which the king has mediatized\r\nand those manors of mesne lords which are raised to the rank of\r\nboroughs. We have seen that from the ancient borough the king received a\r\nrevenue of tolls and fines. Therefore he had something to give away. He\r\ncould mediatize the borough. Domesday Book shows us that this had\r\nalready been done in a few instances[853]. At a later time some even of\r\nthe county towns passed out of the king's hands into the hands of earls.\r\nThis happened at Leicester and at Warwick. The earl succeeded to the\r\nking's rights, and the burgesses had to go to the earl for their\r\nliberties and their charters. But such cases are very distinct from\r\nthose in which a mesne lord grants an enfranchising charter to the men\r\nof a place which has hitherto been one of his manors, and by speaking of\r\nboroughs which are 'on the land of mesne lords' we must not confuse two\r\nclasses of towns which have long had different histories. In the ancient\r\nboroughs there is from the first an element that we must call both\r\nartificial and national. The borough does not grow up spontaneously; it\r\nis made; it is 'wrought'; it is 'timbered.' It has a national purpose;\r\nit is maintained 'at the cost of the nation' by the duty that the shire\r\nowes to it. This trait may soon have disappeared, may soon have been\r\nforgotten, but a great work had been done. In these nationally supported\r\nand heterogeneously peopled towns a new kind of community might wax and\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [698] A sketch of the principal argument of this section was\r\n        published in Eng. Hist. Rev., xi. 13, as a review of\r\n        Keutgen's Untersuchungen über den Ursprung der deutschen\r\n        Stadtverfassung. The origin of the French and German towns\r\n        has become the theme of a large and very interesting\r\n        literature.

B. iv. 531 ff.\r\n\r\n  [727] In the A.-S. land-books the word _civitas_ is commonly applied\r\n        to Worcester, Winchester, Canterbury, and other such places,\r\n        which are both bishops' sees and the head places of large\r\n        districts. But (K. v. p. 180) Gloucester is a _civitas_, and\r\n        for some time after the Conquest it is rather the county town\r\n        than the cathedral town that bears this title. Did any one\r\n        ever speak of Selsey or Sherborne as a _civitas_? In 803 (K.\r\n        v. p. 65) the bishops of Canterbury, Lichfield, Leicester,\r\n        Sidnacester, Worcester, Winchester, Dunwich, London and\r\n        Rochester style themselves bishops of _civitates_, while those\r\n        of Hereford, Sherborne, Elmham and Selsey do not use this\r\n        word. But an inference from this would be rash.\r\n\r\n  [728] An interesting example is this. In 779 Offa conveys to a thegn\r\n        land at Sulmonnesburg. The boundaries mentioned in the charter\r\n        are those of the present parish of Bourton-on-the-Water.\r\n        'Sulmonnesburg ... is the ancient camp close to Bourton which\r\n        gave its name to the Domesday Hundred of Salmanesberie, and at\r\n        a gap in the rampart of which a Court Leet was held till\r\n        recently.'

As regards the names of hills and of\r\n        villages named from hills there may occasionally be some\r\n        difficulty in marking off those which go back to _beorh_\r\n        (_berry_, _berrow_, _barrow_) from those which go back to\r\n        _burh_ (_burgh_, _borough_, _bury_). Mr Stevenson tells me\r\n        that in the West of England the termination _-borough_\r\n        sometimes represents _-beorh_.\r\n\r\n  [729] Alfred, 40; Ine, 45.\r\n\r\n  [730] Aethelr. IV. 4. The Quadripartitus is our only authority for\r\n        these _Instituta_; but Dr Liebermann (Quadrip. p. 138) holds\r\n        that the translator had in front of him a document written\r\n        before the Conquest. Schmid would read _borh-bryce_; see p.\r\n        541; but this emendation seems needless. Has not the sum been\r\n        Normanized? The king's _burh-bryce_ used to be 120 (i.e. in\r\n        English 'a hundred') shillings, and a hundred _Norman_\r\n        shillings make £5. So according to the Berkshire custom (D. B.\r\n        i. 56 b) he who by night breaks a _civitas_ pays 100 shillings\r\n        to the king and not (it is noted) to the sheriff.\r\n\r\n  [731] D.

One result of\r\n        this moot was that two plots of land inside the walls, with\r\n        hythes outside the walls, were given by the king, the one to\r\n        the church of Canterbury, the other to the church of\r\n        Worcester.

But this document will hardly be older\r\n        than, if so old as, cent. x., by which time we should suppose\r\n        that _burh_ more often pointed to a borough than to a strong\r\n        house. We may guess that in the latter sense it was supplanted\r\n        by the _hall_ of which we read a great deal in Domesday. See\r\n        above, p. 109. However, it does not seem certain that O.

B. i. 173 it is\r\n        said that the Bishop of Worcester had received the third penny\r\n        of the borough. Apparently in the Confessor's day he received\r\n        £6, the third of a sum of £18. As to the early history of\r\n        markets, see the paper contributed by Mr C. I. Elton to the\r\n        Report of the Royal Commission on Market Rights, 1889.\r\n\r\n  [769] Æthelstan, II. 14.\r\n\r\n  [770] The general equivalence of _port_ and _burh_ we may perhaps\r\n        infer from Æthelstan, II. 14: No one is to coin money outside\r\n        a _port_, and there is to be a moneyer in every _burh_.\r\n\r\n  [771] Stockport, Langport, Amport, Newport-Pagnell, Milborne Port,\r\n        Littleport are instances. But a very small river might be\r\n        sufficient to make a place a haven.\r\n\r\n  [772] Seemingly if this O.-E. _port_ is not Lat. _portus_, it is\r\n        Lat. _porta_, and there is some fascination about the\r\n        suggestion that the _burh-geat_, or in modern German the\r\n        _Burg-gasse_, in which the market is held, was described in\r\n        Latin as _porta burgi_. In A.D. 762 (K. i. p. 133) we have a\r\n        house 'quae iam ad Quenegatum urbis Dorouernis in foro posita\r\n        est.' In A.D. 845 (K. ii. p. 26) we find a 'publica strata' in\r\n        Canterbury 'ubi appellatur Weoweraget,' that is, the gate of\r\n        the men of Wye. But what we have to account for is the\r\n        adoption of _port_ as an English word, and if our ancestors\r\n        might have used _geat_, they need not have borrowed. In A.D.\r\n        857 (K. ii. p. 63) the king bestows on the church of Worcester\r\n        certain liberties at a spot in the town of London, 'hoc est,\r\n        quod habeat intus liberaliter modium et pondera et mensura\r\n        sicut in porto mos est ad fruendum.' To have public weights\r\n        and measures is characteristic of a _portus_ (= haven). The\r\n        word may have spread outwards from London. Dr Stubbs (Const.\r\n        Hist. i. 439) gives a weighty vote for _porta_; but the\r\n        continental usage deserves attention. Pirenne, Revue\r\n        historique, lvii. 75: 'Toutes les villes anciennes [en\r\n        Flandre] s'y forment au bord des eaux et portent le nom\r\n        caractéristique de _portus_, c'est-à-dire de débarcadères.\r\n        C'est de ce mot _portus_ que vient le mot flamand _poorter_,\r\n        qui désigne le bourgeois.'

B. i. 336.\r\n\r\n  [781] D. B. ii. 116. See also the case of Thetford (D. B. ii. 119),\r\n        where there had been numerous burgesses who could choose their\r\n        lords.\r\n\r\n  [782] D.

In 923 (K. v. p. 186) we hear of land outside\r\n        Canterbury called _Burhuuare bocaceras_, apparently acres\r\n        booked to [certain] burgesses.\r\n\r\n  [786] D. B. i. 100.\r\n\r\n  [787] D. B. ii. 107: 'In commune burgensum iiii. xx. acrae terrae;\r\n        et circa murum viii. percae; de quo toto per annum habent\r\n        burgenses lx. sol. ad servicium regis si opus fuerit, sin\r\n        autem, in commune dividunt.' As to this most difficult\r\n        passage, see Round, Antiquary, vol. vi. (1882) p. 97. Perhaps\r\n        the most natural interpretation of it is that the community or\r\n        commune of the burgesses holds this land and receives by way\r\n        of rent from tenants, to whom it is let, the sum of 60\r\n        shillings a year, which, if this be necessary, goes to make up\r\n        what the borough has to pay to the king, or otherwise is\r\n        divisible among the burgesses. But, as Mr Round rightly\r\n        remarks, 60 shillings for this land would be a large rent.\r\n\r\n  [788] D. B. i. 2: 'Ipsi quoque burgenses habebant de rege 33 acras\r\n        terrae in gildam suam.' Another version says, '33 agros terre\r\n        quos burgenses semper habuerunt in gilda eorum de donis omnium\r\n        regum.' The document here cited is preserved in a cartulary of\r\n        St Augustin, and is printed in Larking, Domesday of Kent, App.\r\n        35. It is closely connected with the Domesday Survey and is of\r\n        the highest interest.\r\n\r\n  [789] Gross, Gild Merchant, ii. 37.\r\n\r\n  [790] We do not even know for certain that when our record says that\r\n        the burgesses and the clerks held land 'in gildam suam,' more\r\n        was meant than that the land was part of their geldable\r\n        property. See Gross, Gild Merchant, i. 189. In the Exon\r\n        Domesday the geld is _gildum_.\r\n\r\n  [791] D. B. i. 154.\r\n\r\n  [792] See above, p. 179.\r\n\r\n  [793] In modern York the freemen inhabiting the different wards had\r\n        rights of pasture varying from ward to ward: Appendix to\r\n        Report of Municipal Corporations' Commissioners, 1835, p.\r\n        1745. York is one of the towns in which we may perhaps suppose\r\n        that there has been a gradual union of several communities\r\n        which were at one time agrarianly distinct. See D. B. i. 298.\r\n        Dr Stubbs seems to regard this as a common case and speaks of\r\n        'the townships which made up the _burh_' (Const. Hist. i.\r\n        101). We can not think that the evidence usually points in\r\n        this direction, and have grave doubts as to the existence\r\n        within the walls of various communities that were called\r\n        townships. Within borough walls we must not leap from parish\r\n        to township.\r\n\r\n  [794] D. B. i. 203. As to the whole of this matter see Mr Round's\r\n        paper on Domesday Finance in Domesday Studies, vol. i.\r\n\r\n  [795] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 635.\r\n\r\n  [796] D. B. i. 219.\r\n\r\n  [797] The case of London is anomalous; but not so anomalous as it is\r\n        often supposed to be. On this point see Round, Geoffrey de\r\n        Mandeville, 347 ff. On the Pipe Roll of 2 Hen. II. (pp. 24,\r\n        28) the citizens of Lincoln are accounting for a farm of £180,\r\n        while the sheriff in consequence of this arrangement is\r\n        credited with £140 (blanch) when he accounts for the farm of\r\n        the shire. This is as yet a rare phenomenon.\r\n\r\n  [798] As to the round sums cast on the boroughs, see Round in\r\n        Domesday Studies, i. 117 ff.; also Round, Feudal England, 156.\r\n\r\n  [799] This may not have been the case in East Anglia.\r\n\r\n  [800] D. B. i. 252.\r\n\r\n  [801] D. B. i. 298. Of York we read: 'In the geld of the city are 84\r\n        carucates of land, each of which gelds as much as one house in\r\n        the city.' This seems to point to an automatic adjustment. To\r\n        find out how much geld any house pays, divide the total sum\r\n        that is thrown upon York by the number of houses + 84.\r\n\r\n  [802] Mr Round (Domesday Studies, i. 129) who has done more than\r\n        anyone else for the elucidation of the finance of Domesday,\r\n        has spoken of 'the great Anglo-Saxon principle of _collective\r\n        liability_.' This may be a useful term, provided that we\r\n        distinguish (_a_) liability of a corporation for the whole tax\r\n        whenever it is levied; (_b_) joint and several liability of\r\n        all the burgesses for the whole tax whenever it is levied;\r\n        (_c_) liability of each burgess for a share of the whole tax,\r\n        the amount that he must pay in any year being affected by an\r\n        increase or decrease in the number of contributories.\r\n\r\n  [803] See the entry touching Colchester, above, p. 201, note 787.\r\n\r\n  [804] D. B. i. 1.\r\n\r\n  [805] D. B. i. 238. The custom of Warwick was that when the king\r\n        made an expedition by land ten burgesses of Warwick should go\r\n        for all the rest. He who did not go when summoned [summoned by\r\n        whom?] paid 100 shillings to the king; [so his offence was\r\n        against the king not against the town.] And if the king went\r\n        against his enemies by sea, they sent him four boat-swains or\r\n        four pounds in money.\r\n\r\n  [806] D. B. i. 56 b.\r\n\r\n  [807] D. B. i. 179.\r\n\r\n  [808] At Chester (D. B. i. 262 b) the twelve civic _iudices_ paid a\r\n        fine if they were absent without excuse from the 'hundret.'\r\n        This seems to mean that their court was called a hundred moot.\r\n        It is very possible that, at least in the earliest time, the\r\n        moot that was held in the borough had jurisdiction over a\r\n        territory considerably larger than the walled space, and in\r\n        this case the urban would hardly differ from the rural\r\n        hundred. A somewhat new kind of 'hundred' might be formed\r\n        without the introduction of any new idea.\r\n\r\n  [809] D. B. i. 336.\r\n\r\n  [810] Hist. Eng.

B. ii. 286 b; for Beccles, 369 b.\r\n\r\n  [835] D. B. i. 136 b: 'In burbio huius villae 52 burgenses.' The\r\n        word _burbium_ looks as if some one had argued that as\r\n        _suburbium_ means an annex to a town, therefore _burbium_ must\r\n        mean a town. But the influence of _burh_, _burg_, _bourg_ may\r\n        be suspected. A few pages back (132) the _burgum_ of Hertford\r\n        seems to be spoken of as 'hoc suburbium.' It is of course to\r\n        be remembered that _burgus_ or _burgum_ was a word with which\r\n        the Normans were familiar: it was becoming the French _bourg_.\r\n        It is difficult to unravel any distinctively French thread in\r\n        the institutional history of our boroughs during the Norman\r\n        age; but the little knot of traders clustered outside a lord's\r\n        castle at Clare or Berkhampstead, at Tutbury, Wigmore or\r\n        Rhuddlan may have for its type rather a French _bourg_ than an\r\n        English _burh_. Indeed at Rhuddlan (i. 269) the burgesses have\r\n        received the law of Breteuil.\r\n\r\n  [836] For Taunton, see D. B. i. 87 b: 'Istae consuetudines pertinent\r\n        ad Tantone: burgeristh, latrones, pacis infractio, hainfare,\r\n        denarii de hundred, denarii S. Petri, ciricieti.' Compare the\r\n        document which stands as K. 897 (iv. 233): 'Ðæt is ærest ...\r\n        seo men redden into Tantune cirhsceattas and burhgerihtu.' See\r\n        also K. 1084 (v. 157): 'ut episcopi homines [apud Tantun] tam\r\n        nobiles quam ignobiles ... hoc idem ius in omni haberent\r\n        dignitate quo regis homines perfruuntur, regalibus fiscis\r\n        commorantes.'\r\n\r\n  [837] D. B. ii. 5 b.\r\n\r\n  [838] D. B. ii. 104.\r\n\r\n  [839] D. B. i. 163.\r\n\r\n  [840] D. B. i. 75.\r\n\r\n  [841] D. B. i. 100, 108 b.\r\n\r\n  [842] D. B. i. 86 b.\r\n\r\n  [843] D.

B. 66.\r\n\r\n  [848] The burgesses belonging to Ramsbury are really at Cricklade:\r\n        D. B. i. 66.\r\n\r\n  [849] It seems very possible that already before the Conquest some\r\n        boroughs had fallen out of the list. In cent. x. we read, for\r\n        example, of a _burh_ at Towcester and of a _burh_ at Witham in\r\n        Essex. We must not indeed contend that a shire-supported town\r\n        with tenurial heterogeneity came into existence wherever\r\n        Edward the Elder or the Lady of the Mercians 'wrought a\r\n        _burh_.' But still during a time of peace the walls of a petty\r\n        _burh_ would be neglected, and, if the great majority of the\r\n        inhabitants were the king's tenants, there would be little to\r\n        distinguish this place from a royal village of the common\r\n        kind. See for Towcester, D. B. i. 219 b; for Witham, D. B. ii.\r\n        1 b. In later days we may see an old borough, such as\r\n        Buckingham, falling very low and sending no burgesses to\r\n        parliament. It will be understood that we have not pledged\r\n        ourselves to any list of the places that were boroughs in\r\n        1066. There are difficult cases such as that of St Albans; see\r\n        above, p. 181. But, we are persuaded that few places were\r\n        deemed _burgi_, except the shire towns.\r\n\r\n  [850] A last relic of the old borough peace may be found in\r\n        Britton's definition of burglary (i. 42): 'Burglars are those\r\n        who feloniously in time of peace break churches, or the houses\r\n        of others, or the walls or gates of our cities or boroughs\r\n        (_de nos citez ou de nos burgs_).'\r\n\r\n  [851] By a charter of enfranchisement a lord might introduce burgage\r\n        tenure and abolish 'servile customs'; but it must be, to say\r\n        the least, doubtful whether he could, without the king's\r\n        licence, confer upon a village the public status of a borough\r\n        and e.g. authorize it to behave like a hundred before the\r\n        justices in eyre. This is one of the reasons why sheriffs can\r\n        draw the line where they please, and why some towns which have\r\n        been enfranchised never obtain a secure place in the list of\r\n        parliamentary boroughs.\r\n\r\n  [852] Hist. Eng. Law, i. 630. When it is being said that if land in\r\n        the borough escheats, it always escheats to the king, the\r\n        mesne tenures are already being forgotten within the borough,\r\n        just as in modern times we have forgotten them in the open\r\n        country. The burgher's power of devising his land made escheat\r\n        a rare event, and so destroyed the evidence of mesne tenure.\r\n\r\n  [853] See above, p. 212. Also the king might give away an undivided\r\n        share of the borough. Apparently the church of Worcester had\r\n        received the third penny of the city ever since the day when\r\n        the _burh_ was wrought by the ealdorman and lady of the\r\n        Mercians. See above, p. 194.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSAY II.\r\n\r\nENGLAND BEFORE THE CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Object of this Essay.]\r\n\r\nNo one can spend patient hours in examining the complex web disclosed by\r\nDomesday Book without making some theories, at least some guesses, about\r\nthe political, social and economic threads of which that web has been\r\nwoven. But if we here venture to fashion and state a few such theories\r\nor such guesses, it is with no hope that they will be a complete\r\nexplanation of old English history. For, in the first place, we are to\r\nspeak mainly of the things of the law, of legal ideas and legal forms,\r\nand once for all we may protest that we have no wish to overestimate\r\ntheir importance. The elaborate and long continued development to which\r\nwe point when we speak of 'feudalism,' can not be fully explained by any\r\ndiscussion of legal ideas and legal forms. On the other hand, it can not\r\nbe fully explained without such discussion, for almost all that we can\r\nknow about it is to be found in legal documents. In the second place, we\r\nare to make a selection. Certain phases of our oldest legal history,\r\nnotably those which are called 'constitutional,' have been so fully\r\ntreated by classical books, that at the present moment there is no good\r\nreason why we should traverse the ground that has been covered.\r\nTherefore if, for example, we say little or nothing of the ancient\r\nGermanic _comitatus_ or of the relationship between lord and man in so\r\nfar as it is a merely personal relationship, this will not be because we\r\nhave overlooked these matters; it will be because there is nothing to be\r\ngained by our repeating what has been well and sufficiently said by Dr\r\nKonrad Maurer, Dr Reinhold Schmid, Dr Stubbs and others. And if, again,\r\nwe lay great stress on what may be called the ecclesiastical phase of\r\nthe feudalizing process, this will not be because we think it the only\r\nphase, it will be because we think that too little attention has been\r\npaid by English writers to the influence which the churches exercised\r\nupon temporal affairs by means of their endowments. The day for an\r\nartistically proportioned picture of the growth of feudalism has not yet\r\ncome; the day for a quantitative analysis of the elements of feudalism\r\nmay never come; for the present we must be content if we can bring out a\r\nfew new truths or set a few old truths in a new light. The vast and\r\nintricate subject may be approached from many different quarters. If we\r\ncan make some little progress along our chosen path, we shall be all the\r\nmore willing to admit that progress along other paths is possible.\r\n\r\n[Fundamental controversies as to Anglo-Saxon history.]\r\n\r\nIt can not but be, however, that this part of our work should be\r\ncontroversial, though it need not be polemical. We are told that 'in\r\nspite of all the labour that has been spent on the early history of\r\nEngland, scholars are still at variance upon the most fundamental of\r\nquestions: the question whether that history began with a population of\r\nindependent freemen or with a population of dependent serfs[854]'. Some\r\nexception may be taken to this statement. No one denies that for the\r\npurposes of English history slavery is a primitive institution, nor that\r\nin the seventh and eighth centuries there were many slaves in England.\r\nOn the other hand, no one will assert that we can ascertain, even\r\napproximately, the ratio that the number of slaves bore to the number of\r\nfree men. Moreover such terms as 'dependent' and 'independent' are not\r\nwords that we can profitably quarrel over, since they are inexact and\r\nambiguous. For all this, however, it may well be said that there are two\r\nmain theories before the world. The one would trace the English manor\r\nback to the Roman villa, would think of the soil of England as being\r\ntilled from the first mainly by men who, when they were not mere slaves,\r\nwere _coloni_ ascript to the land. The other would postulate the\r\nexistence of a large number of free men who with their own labour tilled\r\ntheir own soil, of men who might fairly be called free 'peasant\r\nproprietors' since they were far from rich and had few slaves or\r\nservants, and yet who were no mere peasants since they habitually bore\r\narms in the national host. What may be considered for the moment as a\r\nvariant on this latter doctrine would place the ownership of the soil,\r\nor of large tracts of the soil, not in these free peasants taken as\r\nindividuals, but in free village communities.\r\n\r\n[The Romanesque theory unacceptable.]\r\n\r\nNow we will say at once that the first of these theories we can not\r\naccept if it be put forward in a general form, if it be applied to the\r\nwhole or anything like the whole of England. Certainly we are not in a\r\nposition to deny that in some cases, a Roman villa having come into the\r\nhands of a Saxon chieftain, he treated the slaves and _coloni_ that he\r\nfound upon it in much the same way as that in which they had been\r\ntheretofore treated, though even in such a case the change was in all\r\nprobability momentous, since large commerce and all that large commerce\r\nimplies had perished. But against the hypothesis that this was the\r\ngeneral case the English language and the names of our English villages\r\nare the unanswered protest. It seems incredible that the bulk of the\r\npopulation should have been of Celtic blood and yet that the Celtic\r\nlanguage should not merely have disappeared, but have stamped few traces\r\nof itself upon the speech of the conquerors.[855] This we regard as an\r\nobjection which goes to the root of the whole matter and which throws\r\nupon those who would make the English nation in the main a nation of\r\nCeltic bondmen, the burden of strictly proving their thesis. The German\r\ninvaders must have been numerous. The Britons were no cowards. They\r\ncontested the soil inch by inch. The struggle was long and arduous. What\r\nthen, we must ask, became of the mass of the victors? Surely it is\r\nimpossible that they at once settled down as the 'dependent serfs' of\r\ntheir chieftains. Again, though it is very likely that where we find a\r\nland of scattered steads and of isolated hamlets, there the Germanic\r\nconquerors have spared or have been unable to subdue the Britons or have\r\nadapted their own arrangements to the exterior framework that was\r\nprovided by Celtic or Roman agriculture, still, until Meitzen[856] has\r\nbeen refuted, we are compelled to say that our true villages, the\r\nnucleated villages with large 'open fields,' are not Celtic, are not\r\nRoman, but are very purely and typically German. But this is not all.\r\nHereafter we shall urge some other objections. The doctrine in question\r\nwill give no rational explanation of the state of things that is\r\nrevealed to us by the Domesday Survey of the northern and eastern\r\ncounties and it will give no rational explanation of seignorial justice.\r\nThis being so, we seem bound to suppose that at one time there was a\r\nlarge class of peasant proprietors, that is, of free men who tilled the\r\nsoil that they owned, and to discuss the process which substitutes for\r\npeasant proprietorship the manorial organization.\r\n\r\n[Feudalism as a normal stage.]\r\n\r\nThough we can not deal at any length with a matter which lies outside\r\nthe realm of legal history, we ought at once to explain that we need not\r\nregard this change as a retrogression. There are indeed historians who\r\nhave not yet abandoned the habit of speaking of feudalism as though it\r\nwere a disease of the body politic. Now the word 'feudalism' is and\r\nalways will be an inexact term, and, no doubt, at various times and\r\nplaces there emerge phenomena which may with great propriety be called\r\nfeudal and which come of evil and make for evil. But if we use the term,\r\nand often we do, in a very wide sense, if we describe several centuries\r\nas feudal, then feudalism will appear to us as a natural and even a\r\nnecessary stage in our history: that is to say, if we would have the\r\nEngland of the sixteenth century arise out of the England of the eighth\r\nwithout passing through a period of feudalism, we must suppose many\r\nimmense and fundamental changes in the nature of man and his\r\nsurroundings. If we use the term in this wide sense, then (the barbarian\r\nconquests being given us as an unalterable fact) feudalism means\r\ncivilization, the separation of employments, the division of labor, the\r\npossibility of national defence, the possibility of art, science,\r\nliterature and learned leisure; the cathedral, the scriptorium, the\r\nlibrary, are as truly the work of feudalism as is the baronial castle.\r\nWhen therefore we speak, as we shall have to speak, of forces which make\r\nfor the subjection of the peasantry to seignorial justice and which\r\nsubstitute the manor with its villeins for the free village, we\r\nshall--so at least it seems to us--be speaking not of abnormal forces,\r\nnot of retrogression, not of disease, but in the main of normal and\r\nhealthy growth. Far from us indeed is the cheerful optimism which\r\nrefuses to see that the process of civilization is often a cruel\r\nprocess; but the England of the eleventh century is nearer to the\r\nEngland of the nineteenth than is the England of the seventh--nearer by\r\njust four hundred years.\r\n\r\n[Feudalism as progress and as retrogress.]\r\n\r\nThis leads to a remark which concerns us more deeply. As regards the\r\nlegal ideas in which feudalism is expressed a general question may be\r\nraised. If we approach them from the standpoint of modern law, if we\r\napproach them from the standpoint of the classical Roman law, they are\r\nconfused ideas. In particular no clear line is drawn between public and\r\nprivate law. Ownership is _dominium_; but governmental power,\r\njurisdictional power, these also are _dominium_. Office is property;\r\ntaxes are rents; governmental relationships arise _ex contractu_. Then\r\nwithin the province of private law the ideas are few; these few have\r\nhard work to do; their outlines are blurred. One _dominium_ rises above\r\nanother _dominium_, one seisin over another seisin. Efforts after\r\nprecision made in comparatively recent times by romanizing lawyers serve\r\nonly to show how vague was the subject-matter with which they had to\r\ndeal. They would give the lord a _dominium directum_, the vassal a\r\n_dominium utile_; but then, when there has been further subinfeudation,\r\nthis vassal will have a _dominium utile_ as regards the lord paramount,\r\nbut a _dominium directum_ as regards the sub-vassal. So again, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, the gift of land shades off into the 'loan' of\r\nland, the 'loan' into the gift. The question then occurs whether we are\r\nright in applying to this state of things such a word as 'confusion,' a\r\nword which implies that things that once were distinct have wrongfully\r\nor unfortunately been mixed up with each other, a word which implies\r\nerror or retrogression.\r\n\r\n[Progress and retrogress in the history of legal ideas.]\r\n\r\nNow, no doubt, from one point of view, namely that of universal history,\r\nwe do see confusion and retrogression. Ideal possessions which have been\r\nwon for mankind by the thought of Roman lawyers are lost for a long\r\nwhile and must be recovered painfully. Lines that have been traced with\r\nprecision are smudged out, and then they must be traced once more. If we\r\nregard western Europe as a whole, this retrogression appears as a slow\r\nchange. How slow--that is a much controverted question. There are, for\r\nexample, historians who would have us think of the Gaul of Merovingian\r\ntimes as being in the main governed by Roman ideas and institutions,\r\nwhich have indeed been sadly debased, but still are the old ideas and\r\ninstitutions. There are other historians who can discover in this same\r\nGaul little that is not genuinely German and barbarous. But at any rate,\r\nit must be admitted that somehow or another a retrogression takes\r\nplace, that the best legal ideas of the ninth and tenth centuries are\r\nnot so good, so modern, as those of the third and fourth. If, however,\r\nwe take a narrower view and fix our eyes upon the barbarian hordes which\r\ninvade a Roman province, shall we say that their legal thought gradually\r\ngoes to the bad, and loses distinctions which it has once apprehended?\r\nTo turn to our own case--Shall we say that Englishmen of the eighth\r\ncentury mark the line that divides public from private law, while\r\nEnglishmen of the eleventh century can not perceive it?\r\n\r\n[The contact of barbarism and civilization.]\r\n\r\nNo one perhaps to such a question would boldly say: Yes. And yet, when\r\nit comes to a treatment of particulars, an affirmative answer seems to\r\nbe implied in much that has been written even by modern historians. They\r\nbegin at the beginning and attribute precise ideas and well-defined law\r\nto the German conquerors of Britain. If they began with the eleventh\r\ncentury and thence turned to the earlier time, they might come to\r\nanother opinion, to the opinion that in the beginning all was very\r\nvague, and that such clearness and precision as legal thought has\r\nattained in the days of the Norman Conquest has been very gradually\r\nattained and is chiefly due to the influence which the old heathen world\r\nworking through the Roman church has exercised upon the new. The process\r\nthat is started when barbarism is brought into contact with civilization\r\nis not simple. The hitherto naked savage may at once assume some part of\r\nthe raiment, perhaps the hat, of the white man. When after a while he\r\nputs these things aside and learns to make for himself clothes suitable\r\nto the climate in which he lives and the pursuits in which he is\r\nengaged, we see in this an advance, not a relapse; and yet he has\r\nabandoned some things that belong to the white man. Even so when our\r\nkings of the eighth century set their hands to documents written in\r\nLatin and bristling with the technical terms of Roman law, to documents\r\nwhich at first sight seem to express clear enough ideas of ownership and\r\nalienation, we must not at once assume that they have grasped these\r\nideas. In course of time men will evolve formulas which will aptly fit\r\ntheir thought, for example, the 'feudal' charter of feoffment with its\r\n_tenendum de me_ and its _reddendo mihi_. Externally it will not be so\r\nRoman or (we may say it) so modern a document as was the land-book of\r\nthe eighth century, and yet in truth there has been progress not\r\nretrogress. Words that Roman lawyers would have understood give way\r\nbefore words which would have been nonsense to them, _feoffamentum_,\r\n_liberatio seisinae_ and the like. This is as it should be. Men are\r\nlearning to say what they really mean.\r\n\r\n[Our materials.]\r\n\r\nAnd now let us remember that our materials for the legal history of the\r\nlong age which lies behind Domesday Book are scanty. A long age it is,\r\neven if we measure it only from the date of Augustin's mission. The\r\nConqueror stands midway between Æthelbert and Elizabeth. To illustrate\r\nfive hundred years of legal history we have only the dooms and the\r\nland-books. The dooms are so much taken up with the work of keeping the\r\npeace and punishing theft that they tell us little of the structure of\r\nsociety or of the feudalizing process, while as to what they imply it is\r\nbut too easy for different men to form different opinions. Some twelve\r\nhundred land-books or charters, genuine and spurious, are our best,\r\nalmost our only, evidence, and it must needs be that they will give us\r\nbut a partial and one-sided view of intricate and many-sided facts[857].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [854] Ashley, Introduction to Fustel de Coulanges, Origin of\r\n        Property in Land, p. vii.\r\n\r\n  [855] The gradual disappearance in recent times of the Irish\r\n        language is no parallel case, for this is a triumph of the\r\n        printing press.

A model has been lately set by Prof. Napier\r\n        and Mr Stevenson in their edition of the Crawford Collection\r\n        of Early Charters, Oxford, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Book-land and the Land-book._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The lands of the churches.]\r\n\r\nNow these charters or land-books are, with hardly any exceptions,\r\necclesiastical title-deeds. Most of them are deeds whereby lands were\r\nconveyed to the churches; some are deeds whereby lands were conveyed to\r\nmen who conveyed them to the churches. Partial, one-sided and in details\r\nuntrustworthy though the testimony that they bear may be, there is still\r\none general question that they ought to answer and we ought to ask.\r\nDomesday Book shows us many of the churches as the lords of wide and\r\ncontinuous tracts of land. Now about this important element in the\r\nfeudal structure the land-books ought to tell us something. They ought\r\nto tell us how the churches acquired their territories; they ought to\r\ntell us what class of men made gifts of land to the churches; they ought\r\nto tell us whether those gifts were of big tracts or of small pieces.\r\nFor example, let us remember how Domesday Book shows us that four\r\nminsters, Worcester, Evesham, Pershore and Westminster, were lords of\r\nseven-twelfths of Worcestershire, that the church of Worcester was lord\r\nof one quarter of that shire and lord of the triple hundred of\r\nOswaldslaw. How did that church become the owner of a quarter of a\r\ncounty, to say nothing of lands in other shires? We ought to be able to\r\nanswer this question in general terms, for among the charters that have\r\ncome down to us there is no series which is longer, there is hardly a\r\nlong series which is of better repute, than the line of the land-books\r\nwhich belonged to the church of Worcester. They come to us for the more\r\npart in the form of a cartulary compiled not long after the Conquest by\r\nthe monk Heming at the instance of Bishop Wulfstan[858].\r\n\r\n[How the churches acquired their lands.]\r\n\r\nNow the answer that they give to our question is this:--With but few\r\nexceptions, the donors of these lands were kings or under-kings, kings\r\nor under-kings of the Mercians, kings of the English, and the gifts were\r\nlarge gifts. Very often the charter comprised a tract of land which in\r\nDomesday Book appears as a whole vill or as several contiguous vills.\r\nSeldom indeed is the subject-matter of the gift described as being a\r\n_villa_ or a _vicus_:--the king merely says that he gives so many manses\r\nor the land of so many _manentes_ at a certain place. Still, if we\r\ncompare these charters with Domesday Book, we shall become convinced\r\nthat very often the land given was of wide extent. For example, Domesday\r\nBook tells us that the church of Worcester holds Sedgebarrow\r\n(Seggesbarue) where it has four hides for geld, but eight plough teams.\r\nHow was this acquired? The monks answer that three centuries ago, in\r\n777, Aldred the under-king of the Hwiccas gave them _viculum qui\r\nnuncupatur aet Segcesbaruue iiii. mansiones_, that land having been\r\ngiving to him by Offa king of the Mercians in order that the soul of the\r\n_subregulus_ might have something done for it[859]. In the Conqueror's\r\nreign the Archbishop of Canterbury held a great estate in Middlesex of\r\nwhich Harrow was the centre, and which contained no less than 100 hides.\r\nAlready in 832 the archbishop or his church had 104 hides at\r\nHarrow[860]. Here we will state our belief, its grounds will appear in\r\nanother essay, that the 'manses' that the kings throw about by fives and\r\ntens and twenties, are no small holdings, but hides each of which\r\ncontains, or is for fiscal purposes deemed to contain, some 120 acres of\r\narable land together with stretches, often wide stretches, of wood,\r\nmeadow and waste, the extent of which varies from case to case. From the\r\nseventh century onwards the kings are giving large territories to the\r\nchurches. One instance is beyond suspicion, for Bede attests it. In 686\r\nor thereabouts Æthelwealh king of the South Saxons gave to Bishop\r\nWilfrid the land of eighty-seven families in the promontory of Selsey,\r\nand among its inhabitants were two hundred and fifty male and female\r\nslaves[861]. This gift comprised a spacious tract of country; it\r\ncomprised what then were, or what afterwards became, the sites of many\r\nvillages[862]. But to whichever of our oldest churches we turn, the\r\nstory that it proclaims in its title-deeds is always the same:--We\r\nobtained our lands by means of royal grants; we obtained them not in\r\nlittle pieces, here a few acres and there a few, but in great pieces.\r\nCanterbury and Winchester echo the tale that is told by Worcester.\r\nAnother example may be given. It is one that has been carefully examined\r\nof late. In 739 King Æthelheard of Wessex gave to Forthhere bishop of\r\nSherborne twenty _cassati_ at the place called 'Cridie.' Thereby he\r\ndisposed of what now are 'the parishes of Crediton, Newton St. Cyres,\r\nUpton Pyne, Brampford Speke, Hittesleigh, Drewsteignton, Colebrooke,\r\nMorchard Bishop, Sandford, Kennerleigh and the modern parish of\r\nSherwood, part of Cheriton Bishop, and possibly the whole of\r\nClannaborough.' He disposed of the whole and more than the whole of the\r\nmodern 'hundred' of Crediton[863]. Then, to choose one last instance, it\r\nis said that already in 679 Osric of the Hwiccas gave to an abbess\r\n_centum manentes qui adiacent civitati quae vocatur Hát Bathu_[864]. It\r\nis not unlikely that this means that a king newly converted to\r\nChristianity disposed by one deed of many square leagues of land,\r\nnamely, of the hundred of Bath[865]. The kingdom of the Hwiccas was not\r\nboundless. If Osric executed a few more charters of this kind he would\r\nsoon have 'booked' it all.\r\n\r\n[The earliest books.]\r\n\r\nLet us then examine with some care the charters that come to us from the\r\nearliest period, a period which shall begin with the year 600 and end\r\nwith the year 750. From this time we have some forty charters\r\nsufficiently genuine for our present purpose. With hardly an exception\r\nthe grantor is a king or an under-king, while the grantee is a dead\r\nsaint, a church, a bishop, an abbot, or a body of monks. If the grantee\r\nis a layman, the gift is made to him in order that he may found a\r\nminster. If this purpose is not expressed, it is to be understood. Thus\r\nin 674 or thereabouts Wulfhere king of the Mercians gives five manses to\r\nhis kinsman Berhtferth as a perpetual inheritance. Berhtferth is to have\r\nfull power to give them to whom he pleases, and we are not told that he\r\nproposes to devote them to pious uses. Nevertheless, the king makes the\r\ngift 'for the love of Almighty God and of his faithful servant St.\r\nPeter[866].' In other cases the lay donee is to hold the land 'by church\r\nright' or 'by minster right[867].' Indeed there seems to be no single\r\ndeed of this period which does not purport upon its face to be in some\r\nsort an ecclesiastical act, an act done for the good of the\r\nchurch[868].\r\n\r\n[Exotic character of the book.]\r\n\r\nThese charters are documents of ecclesiastical origin; they are also\r\ndocuments of foreign origin. The bishops and abbots have brought or have\r\nimported models from abroad. The 'books' that they induce the kings to\r\nsign are full of technical phrases which already have an ancient\r\nhistory. By way of illustration we will notice one point at which there\r\nis an instructive resemblance and an instructive contrast. On the\r\nContinent a grantor of lands ends his conveyance with a 'penal\r\nstipulation.' If an heir of his controverts the deed, he is to pay a\r\ncertain sum, and none the less the conveyance is to remain in full\r\nforce. In England we can not thus stipulate for a pecuniary penalty; the\r\nland-book is still so purely an ecclesiastical affair that the\r\npunishment of its violator must be left to the church and to God. So\r\ninstead of stipulating that he shall pay money, we stipulate that he\r\nshall be excommunicated and, if impenitent, damned, but we do not forget\r\nto add that none the less the conveyance shall remain as valid and\r\neffectual as ever. 'If anyone,' says Eadric of Kent, 'shall attempt to\r\ngo against this gift, let him be separated from all Christianity and the\r\nbody and blood of Jesus Christ, _manentem hanc donationis chartulam[869]\r\nin sua nihilominus firmitate_.' Such words may look somewhat out of\r\nplace in their new surroundings; but they are part of a venerable\r\nformula.[870]\r\n\r\n[The book purports to confer ownership.]\r\n\r\nBut what is the model to which in the last resort these documents go\r\nback? A conveyance by a Roman landowner. He has in the land full and\r\nabsolute _dominium_ and is going to transfer this to another. Let us\r\nobserve that the recorded motive which prompts a king to set his cross,\r\nor rather Christ's cross, to a land-book is a purely personal motive. He\r\nwishes to save his soul, he desires pardon for his crimes[871]. Of the\r\nwelfare of his realm he says nothing; but his soul must be saved.\r\nSometimes he will give land to an under-king or to an ealdorman, for\r\nthey also have souls and may desire salvation[872]. He is acting as a\r\nprivate landowner might act. Then he uses terms and phrases which belong\r\nto the realm of pure private law. He asserts in the most energetic of\r\nall the words that the law of the lower empire could provide that he\r\nis a landowner and that he is going to transfer landownership. The\r\nland in question is _tellus mea_[873] or it is _terra iuris mei_[874].\r\nThen it is the very land itself that he gives, the land of so many\r\nmanses, 'with all the appurtenances, fields, pastures, woods, marshes.'\r\nIt is no mere right over the land that he gives, but the very soil\r\nitself. Next let us observe the terms in which the act of conveyance is\r\nstated:--_perpetualiter trado et de meo iure in tuo transscribo terram\r\n... ut tam tu quam posteri tui teneatis, possideatis et quaecunque\r\nvolueris de eadem terra facere liberam habeatis potestatem_[875]. The\r\nLatin language of the time had no terms more potent or precise than\r\nthese. Or again: _aliquantulam agri partem ... Waldhario episcopo in\r\ndominio donare decrevimus_[876]. Or again: _aeternaliter et\r\nperseverabiliter possideat abendi vel dandi cuicumque eligere\r\nvoluerit_[877]. But it is needless to multiply examples.\r\n\r\n[Does the book really confer ownership?]\r\n\r\nNo doubt then, if we bring to the interpretation of these instruments\r\nthe ideas of an earlier or of a later time, the ideas of ancient Rome or\r\nof modern Europe, we see the king as a landowner conferring on the\r\nchurches landownership pure and simple. The fact on which our\r\nconstitutional historians have laid stress, namely, that sometimes (for\r\nwe must not overstate the case) the king says that the bishops and his\r\ngreat men are consenting to his deed, important though it may be in\r\nother contexts, is of little moment here. The king is put before us as\r\nthe owner of the land conveyed; it is, he says, _terra mea, terra iuris\r\nmei_. The rule, if rule it be, that he must not give away his land\r\nwithout the consent of bishops and nobles in no way denies his\r\nownership. However, we are at the moment more concerned with the fact,\r\nor seeming fact, that what he gives to the churches is ownership and\r\nnothing less.\r\n\r\n[The book really conveys a superiority.]\r\n\r\nBut if we loyally accept this seeming fact and think it over, to what\r\nconclusions shall we not be brought, when we remember how wide were the\r\nlands which the churches acquired from the kings, when we think once\r\nmore how by virtue of royal gifts the church of Worcester acquired a\r\nquarter of a county? When these lands were given to the church were they\r\nwaste lands? It is plain that this was not the common case. Already\r\nthere were manses, there were arable fields, there were meadows, there\r\nwere tillers of the soil. One of two conclusions seems to follow. Either\r\nthe king really did own these large districts, and the tillers of the\r\nsoil were merely his slaves or _coloni_, who were conveyed along with\r\nthe soil, or else the clear and emphatic language of the charters sadly\r\nneeds explanation. Now if we hold by the letter of the charters, if we\r\nsay that the king really does confer landownership upon the churches,\r\nthere will be small room left for any landowners in England save the\r\nkings, the churches and perhaps a few great nobles. This is a theory\r\nwhich for many reasons we can not adopt; no one can adopt it who is not\r\nprepared to believe that Britain was conquered by a handful of\r\nchieftains without followers. The only alternative course seems that of\r\nsaying that many of the land-books even of the earliest period, despite\r\ntheir language, convey not the ownership of land, but (the term must be\r\nallowed us) a 'superiority' over land and over free men.\r\n\r\n[A modern analogy.]\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment remember that the wording of a modern English\r\nconveyance might easily delude a layman or a foreigner. An impecunious\r\nearl, we will say, sells his ancient family estate. We look at the deed\r\nwhereby this sale is perfected. The Earl of _A._ grants unto _B. C._ and\r\nhis heirs all the land delineated on a certain map and described in a\r\ncertain schedule. That in substance is all that the deed tells us. We\r\nlook at the map; we see a tract of many thousand acres, which, besides a\r\ngrand mansion, has farm-houses, cottages, perhaps, entire villages upon\r\nit. The schedule tells us the names of the fields and of the\r\nfarm-houses. Like enough no word will hint that any one lives in the\r\nhouses and cottages, or that any one, save the seller, has any right of\r\nany kind in any part of this wide territory. But what is the truth?\r\nPerhaps a hundred different men, farmers and cottagers, have rights of\r\ndifferent kinds in various portions of the tract. Some have leases, some\r\nhave 'agreements for leases,' some hold for terms of years, some hold\r\nfrom year to year, some hold at will. The rights of these tenants\r\nstand, as it were, between the purchaser and the land that he has\r\nbought. He has bought the benefit, and the burden also, of a large mass\r\nof contracts. But of these things his conveyance says nothing[878]. And\r\nso again, in the brief charters of the thirteenth century a feoffor will\r\nsay no more than that he has given _manerium meum de Westona_, as though\r\nthe manor of Weston were some simple physical object like a black horse,\r\nand yet under analysis this _manerium_ turns out to be a complex tangle\r\nof rights in which many men, free and villein, are concerned.\r\n\r\n[Conveyance of superiority in early times.]\r\n\r\nBut it will be said that all this is the result of 'feudalism.' It\r\nimplies just that dismemberment of the _dominium_ which is one of\r\nfeudalism's main characteristics. Undoubtedly in the twelfth century the\r\nfree tenant in fee simple who holds land 'in demesne' can have, must\r\nhave, a lord above him, who also holds and is seised of that land and\r\nwho will speak of the land as his. But we are now in the age before\r\nfeudalism, in the seventh and eighth centuries. Are we to believe that\r\nthe free owner of Kemble's 'ethel, hid, or alod' might have above him,\r\nperhaps always had above him, not merely a lord (for a personal relation\r\nof patronage between lord and man is not to the point), but a landlord:\r\none who would speak of that 'ethel, hid or alod' as _terra iuris mei_:\r\none who to save his soul would give that land to a church and tell the\r\nbishop or abbot to do whatever he pleased with it? If we believe this,\r\nshall we not be believing that so far as English history can be carried\r\nthere is no age before 'feudalism'?\r\n\r\n[Illustrations.]\r\n\r\nWe will glance for a moment at two transactions which took place near\r\nthe end of the seventh century. Bede tells how Æthelwealh king of the\r\nSouth Saxons was persuaded to become a Christian by Wulfhere king of the\r\nMercians. The Mercian received the South Saxon as his godson and by way\r\nof christening-gift gave him two provinces, namely the Isle of Wight and\r\nthe territory of the Meanwari in Wessex, perhaps the hundreds of Meon in\r\nHampshire[879]. Then the same Bede tells us that the same Æthelwealh\r\ngave to Bishop Wilfrid a land of eighty-seven families, to wit, the\r\npromontory of Selsey: he gave it with its fields and its men, among whom\r\nwere two hundred and fifty male and female slaves[880]. A modern reader\r\nwill perhaps see here two very different transactions. In the one case\r\nhe sees 'the cession of a province' by one king to another, and possibly\r\nhe thinks how Queen Victoria ceded Heligoland to her imperial\r\ngrandson:--the act is an act of public law, a transfer of sovereignty.\r\nIn the other case he sees a private act, the gift of an estate for pious\r\nuses. But Bede and his translator saw little, if any, difference between\r\nthe two gifts: in each case Bede says 'donavit'; the translator in the\r\none case says 'forgeaf,' in the other 'geaf and sealde.' Now it will\r\nhardly be supposed that the Isle of Wight had no inhabitants who were\r\nnot the slaves or the _coloni_ of the king, and, that being so, we are\r\nnot bound to suppose that there were no free landowners in the\r\npromontory of Selsey. May it not be that what Æthelwealh had to give and\r\ngave to Wilfrid was what in our eyes would be far rather political power\r\nthan private property?\r\n\r\n[What had the king to give?]\r\n\r\nBut over the free land of free landowners what rights had the king which\r\nhe could cede to another king or to a prelate, saying withal that the\r\nsubject of his gift was land? He had, as we think, rights of two kinds\r\nthat were thus alienable; we may call them fiscal rights and justiciary\r\nrights, though such terms must be somewhat too precise when applied to\r\nthe vague thought of the seventh and eighth centuries. Of justiciary\r\nrights we shall speak below. As to the rights that we call fiscal, we\r\nfind that the king is entitled to something that he calls _tributum_,\r\n_vectigal_, to something that he calls _pastus_, _victus_, the king's\r\n_feorm_; also there is military service to be done, and the king, when\r\nmaking a gift, may have a word to say about this.\r\n\r\n[The king's alienable rights.]\r\n\r\nNow it must at once be confessed that the charters of this early period\r\nseldom suggest any such confusion between political power and ownership\r\nas that which we postulate. Still from time to time hints are given to\r\nus that should not be ignored. Thus a Kentish king shortly after the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century gave to the church of Rochester twenty\r\nploughlands, not only 'with the fields, woods, meadows, pastures,\r\nmarshes and waters thereto pertaining,' but also 'with the _tributum_\r\nwhich was paid thence to the king[881].' Such a phrase would hardly be\r\nappropriate if the king were giving land of which he was the absolute\r\nowner, land cultivated for him by his slaves.\r\n\r\n[Military service as a burden on land.]\r\n\r\nA little more light is thrown on the matter by the first rude specimens\r\nof a clause that is to become common in after times, the clause of\r\nimmunity. Already in the seventh century Wulfhere of Mercia, having made\r\na gift of five manses, adds: 'Let this land remain free to all who have\r\nit, from all earthly hardships, known or unknown, except fastness and\r\nbridge and the common host[882].' So in 732 a king of Kent says: 'And no\r\nroyal due shall be found in it henceforth, saving such as is common to\r\nall church lands in this Kent[883].' Æthelbald of Mercia says: 'By my\r\nroyal power I decree that it be free for ever from all tribute of\r\nsecular payments, labours and burdens, so that the said land may render\r\nservice to none but Almighty God and the church[884].' Yet more\r\ninstructive, if we may rely upon it, is the foundation charter of\r\nEvesham Abbey. Æthelweard has given twelve manses: he then says, 'I\r\ndecree that for the future this land be free from all public tribute,\r\npurveyance, royal works, military service (_ab omni publico vectigali, a\r\nvictu, ab expeditione, ab opere regio_) so that all things in that place\r\nwhich are valuable and useful may serve the church of St. Mary, that is\r\nto say, the brethren serving [God] there; save this, that if in the\r\nisland belonging to the said land there shall chance to be an unusual\r\nsupply of mast, the king may have pasture for fattening one herd of\r\npigs, but beyond this no pasture shall be set out for any prince or\r\npotentate[885].' Now in the first place, these charters speak as though\r\nmilitary service is due from land:--I (says the king) declare this land\r\nto be free from the 'fyrd,' from the _expeditio_--or--I declare that it\r\nis free from all earthly burdens, except military service and the duty\r\nof repairing bridge and burh. We are not saying that there is already\r\nmilitary tenure, but we do say that already the 'fyrd' is conceived as a\r\nburden on land, in so much that the phrase 'This land is--or is not--to\r\nbe free of military service' has a meaning. But after all, land never\r\nfights: men fight. Of what men then is the king speaking when he says\r\nthat the land is, or is not, free from the _expeditio_? Not of the\r\ndonees themselves, for they are bishops and monks and serve in no army\r\nbut God's. Not of the slaves who are on the land, for they are not\r\n'fyrd-worthy.' He is speaking of free men who live on the land; he is\r\ndeclaring that when he has, if so modern a term be suffered, 'attorned'\r\nthem to the church, they will still have to serve in warfare, or he is\r\ndeclaring that they will be free even from this duty to the state in\r\norder that the land may be the more absolutely at the service of God and\r\nHis stewards.\r\n\r\n[The king's _feorm_.]\r\n\r\nThen military service, along with the duty of repairing bridges and\r\nfastnesses, belongs to a genus of dues, of which unfortunately we get\r\nbut a vague description. There are _vectigalia publica_, _opera regia_,\r\n_onera saecularia_, there is _tributum_, there is _victus_. How much of\r\nthe information that we get about these matters from later days we may\r\ncarry back with us to the earliest period it is difficult to say.\r\nApparently the king, the under-king, even the ealdorman, has a certain\r\nright of living at the expense of his subjects, of making a progress\r\nthrough the villages and quartering himself, his courtiers, his\r\nhuntsmen, his dogs and horses upon the folk of the townships, of\r\nexacting a 'one night's farm' from this village, a 'two nights' farm'\r\nfrom that. The men who have to bear these exactions may well be free men\r\nand free landowners; still over them the king has certain rights and\r\nrights that he can give away. According to our interpretation of the\r\ncharters, it is often enough such rights as these that the king is\r\ngiving when he says that he is giving _terram iuris mei_. He declares,\r\nit will be observed, that the land is to be free from _vectigalia_ and\r\n_opera_ to which it has heretofore been subject. But does he mean by\r\nthis to benefit the occupiers of the soil? No, he has no care whatever\r\nto relieve them. Bent on saving his soul, his care is that the land\r\nshall be wholly devoted to the service of God. As we understand the\r\nmatter, whatever _vectigalia_ and _opera_ the king has hitherto exacted\r\nfrom these men the church will now exact. The king has conveyed what he\r\nhad to convey, a superiority over free landowners.\r\n\r\n[Nature of the _feorm_.]\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to doubt whether modern historians have fully realized\r\nthe extent of the rights which the king had over the land of free\r\nlandowners. In the middle of Ine's laws, which follow each other in no\r\nrational order, we suddenly come upon an isolated text, which says this:\r\n'For 10 hides \"to foster\" 10 vessels of honey, 300 loaves, 12 ambers of\r\nWelsh ale, 30 of clear [ale], 2 old [i.e. full grown] oxen or 10\r\nwethers, 10 geese, 20 hens, 10 cheeses, an amber full of butter, 5\r\nsalmon, 20 poundsweight of fodder and a hundred eels[886].' The context\r\nthrows no light upon the sentence; but in truth no sentence in Ine's\r\nlaws has a context. What is its meaning? We can not but think that this\r\n_foster_ is the king's _victus_[887]. Once a year from every ten hides\r\nhe is entitled to this _feorm_. Perhaps it is a 'one night's _feorm_';\r\nfor it may be enough to support a king of the seventh century and a\r\nmodest retinue during twenty-four hours. Still it will be no trifling\r\nburden upon the land, even if we suppose the hide to have 120 arable\r\nacres or thereabouts. Suppose that the king transfers his right over a\r\nsingle hide to some bishop or abbot, the donee will be entitled to\r\nreceive from that hide a rent which can not be called insignificant. We\r\ndare not argue that this law is a general law for the whole of Wessex.\r\nIt may refer only to some newly settled and allotted districts. There\r\nare other hints in these laws of Ine of some large land-settlement, an\r\nallotment of land among great men who have become bound to bring under\r\ncultivation a district theretofore waste[888]. But it is difficult to\r\ndissociate the _foster_ of these laws from the _victus_ of the charters,\r\nand, quite apart from this disputable passage, we have plenty of proof\r\nthat the king's _victus_ was an incumbrance which pressed heavily upon\r\nthe lands of free landowners[889]. If in England the duty of feeding the\r\nking as he journeys through the country developed into a regular tax or\r\nrent this would not stand alone. That duty plays a considerable part in\r\nthe Scandinavian law-books, and in the Denmark of the thirteenth century\r\nwe may find arrangements which are very like that set forth in Ine's\r\nlaw. Every hundred (_herad_), taken as a whole, has to contribute\r\nsomething towards the king's support. Often it is a round sum of money;\r\nbut often it will consist of provisions necessary to maintain the king's\r\nhousehold during a night or two or three nights (_servicium unius\r\nnoctis, servicium duarum noctium_). Then the 'service of two nights' is\r\naccurately defined. It consists of, among other things, 26 salted pigs,\r\n14 live pigs, 16 salted oxen, 16 salted sheep, 360 fowls, 180 geese, 360\r\ncheeses, corn, malt, fodder, butter, herrings, stock-fish, pepper and\r\nsalt. This revenue stands apart from the revenue derived from the crown\r\nlands; it is regarded as a tax rather than a rent; but it is to this\r\nextent rooted in the soil, that the amount due from each hundred\r\n(_herad_) is fixed[890]. There is a great deal to make us think that at\r\na quite early time in England such arrangements as this had been made.\r\nIf we look at the charters we find that the king is always giving away\r\nmanses in fives and tens, fifteens and twenties. This symmetry, this\r\nprevalence of a decimal system, we take to be artificial; already the\r\nmanse, or hide, is a fiscal unit, a fraction of a district which has to\r\nsupply the king with food or with money in lieu of food[891].\r\n\r\n[Tribute and rent.]\r\n\r\nWhatever be the origin of the king's _feorm_--and if we find it in the\r\nvoluntary gifts which yet barbarous Germans make to their kings, we may\r\nnone the less have to admit that it has been touched by the influence of\r\nthe Roman _tributum_--it becomes either a rent or a tax. We may call it\r\nthe one, or we may call it the other, for so long as the recipient of it\r\nis the king, the law of the seventh and eighth centuries will hardly be\r\nable to tell which it is[892]. The king begins to give it away: in the\r\nhands of his donees, in the hands of the churches, it becomes a rent.\r\nThis is not all, however, that the king has to give, or that the king\r\ndoes give, when he says that he is giving land. That he may be giving\r\naway the profits of justice, that he may be giving jurisdiction itself,\r\nwe shall argue hereafter. But probably he has even in early days yet\r\nother things to give, and at any rate in course of time he discovers\r\nthat such is the case. He can give the right to take toll, he can give\r\nmarket rights[893]. It is by no means impossible that he has forest\r\nrights, some general claim to place uncultivated land under his ban, if\r\nhe would hunt therein, and some general claim to the nobler kinds of\r\nfish[894]. Then again, in the eleventh century we find men owing\r\nservices to the king which he still receives rather as king than\r\nas landlord, and the sporadic distribution of these services seems\r\nto show that they are not of modern origin. Such are, for example,\r\nthe 'inwards' and the 'averages' which are done by the free men of\r\nCambridgeshire[895]. We are told in a general way that the thegn owes\r\nfyrdfare, burh-bót and brycg-bót, but that from many lands--the lands\r\ncomprised within no privilege, no franchise--'a greater land-right\r\narises at the king's ban'; for there is the king's deer-hedge to be\r\nmade, there are warships to be provided, there are sea-ward and\r\nhead-ward[896]. Every increase in the needs of the state, in the power\r\nof the state, gives the king new rights in the land, consolidates his\r\nseignory over the land. If a fleet be formed to resist the Danes, the\r\nking has something to dispose of, a new immunity for sale. If a geld be\r\nlevied to buy off the Danes, the king can sell a freedom from this tax,\r\nor he can tell the monks of St. Edmundsbury that they may levy the tax\r\nfrom their men and keep it for their own use[897]. This, we argue, is\r\nnot a new abuse, a phenomenon which first appears in the evil feudal\r\ntime when men began to confuse _imperium_ with _dominium_, kingship with\r\nlandlordship, office with property, tax with rent. On the contrary, we\r\nmust begin with confusion. In some of the very earliest land-books that\r\nhave come down to us what the king really gives, when he says that he is\r\ngiving land, is far rather his kingly superiority over land and\r\nlandowners than anything that we dare call ownership[898].\r\n\r\n[Mixture of ownership and superiority.]\r\n\r\nNot that this is always the case. Very possible is it that from the\r\nfirst the king had villages which were peopled mainly by his theows and\r\nlæts, and intertribal warfare may have increased their number. But the\r\ncharters, for all their apparent precision, will not enable us to\r\ndistinguish between these cases and others in which the villages are\r\nfull of free landowners and their slaves. The charters are not\r\nengendered by the English facts; they are foreign, ecclesiastical,\r\nRoman. By such documents, to our thinking, the king gives what he has to\r\ngive. In one case it may be a full ownership of a village or of some\r\nscattered steads; in another it may be a superiority, which when\r\nanalyzed will turn out to be a right of exacting supplies of provender\r\nfrom the men of the village; in a third, and perhaps a common case, the\r\nsame village will contain the _mansi serviles_ of the king's slaves and\r\nthe _mansi ingenuiles_ of free landowners. He no more thinks of\r\ndistinguishing by the words of his charter his governmental power over\r\nfree men and their land from his ownership of his slaves and the land\r\nthat they are tilling, than his successor of the eleventh or twelfth\r\ncentury will think of making similar distinctions when he bestows a\r\n'manor' or an 'honour.'\r\n\r\n[The king's superiority.]\r\n\r\nWe have been suggesting and shall continue to suggest that at a very\r\nearly time, a time beyond which our land-books will not carry us, the\r\nking is beginning to discover that the whole land which he rules is in a\r\ncertain and a profitable sense his land. He can give it away; he can\r\nbarter it in exchange for spiritual benefits, and this he can do without\r\nwronging the free landholders who are in possession of that land, for\r\nwhat he really gives is the dues (it is too early to say the 'service')\r\nthat they have owed to him and will henceforth owe to his donee. Let us\r\nremember that his successors will undoubtedly be able to do this. In a\r\ncertain sense, Henry II., for example, will have all England to give\r\naway. If we were to put an extreme case, we might have to reckon with\r\npossible rebellions; but every single hide of England Henry can give\r\nwithout wronging any one. Suppose that _C_ has been holding a tract as\r\nthe king's tenant in chief by service worth £5 a year, Henry can make a\r\ngrant of that land to _B_, and by this grant _C_ will not be wronged.\r\nHenceforth _C_ will hold of _B_, and _B_ of the king. Suppose that, on\r\nthe occasion of this grant, services worth £2 a year are reserved, then\r\nthe king has it in his power to grant the land yet once more: to grant\r\nit, let us say, to the Abbot of _A_, who is to hold in frankalmoin; _C_\r\nwill not be wronged, _B_ will not be wronged. What the king has done\r\nwith one hide he can do with every hide in England; piece by piece he\r\ncan give all England away. We have been suggesting and shall continue to\r\nsuggest that at a very early time, even in the first days of English\r\nChristianity, the king is beginning to discover that he has some such\r\npower as that which his successors will exercise. This barbarous\r\nchieftain learns that his political sway over the folk involves a\r\nproprietary and alienable element of which he can make profit. It\r\ninvolves a right to _feorm_ and a right to _wites_. The beef and the\r\ncheese and the Welsh ale that he might have levied from a district he\r\ninvests, if we may so speak, in what he is being taught to regard as the\r\nsafest and most profitable of all securities. He obtains not only\r\nremission of his sins, but also the friendship and aid of bishops and\r\nclergy. And so large stretches of land are 'booked' to the churches. It\r\nis to be feared that if the England of the sixth century had been\r\nvisited by modern Englishmen, the Saxon chieftains would have been\r\nawakened to a consciousness of their 'booking' powers by offers of gin\r\nand rifles.\r\n\r\n[Book-land and church right.]\r\n\r\nIn its original form and when put to its original purpose the land-book\r\nis no mere deed of gift; it is a dedication. Under the sanction of a\r\nsolemn anathema, a tract of land is devoted to the service of God. A\r\nvery full power of disposing of it is given to the bishop or the abbot,\r\nwho is God's servant. As yet the law has none of those subtle ideas\r\nwhich in after ages will enable it to treat him as 'a corporation sole'\r\nor as 'a trustee,' nor can the folk-law meddle much with the affairs of\r\nGod. The bishop or abbot must be able to leave the land to whom he\r\npleases, to institute an heir. Thus 'book-land' stands, as it were,\r\noutside the realm of the folk-law. In all probability the folk-law of\r\nthis early period knows no such thing as testamentary power.\r\nTestamentary power can only be created by the words of a book, by an\r\nanathema. But laymen are not slow to see that they can make use of this\r\nnew institution for purposes of their own, which are not always very\r\npious purposes. By a pretext that he is going to construct a minster, a\r\nman will obtain a book garnished with the crosses of bishops. One day\r\ncalling himself an abbot and the next day calling himself a king's\r\nthegn, a layman among ecclesiastics, an ecclesiastic among laymen, he\r\nwill shirk all duties that are owed to state and church. Already Bede\r\ncomplains of this in a wise and famous letter. He advocates a resumption\r\nof these inconsiderate and misplaced gifts, and reproves the prelates\r\nfor subscribing the books[899]. His letter may have done good; but\r\nlaymen still obtained books which authorized them to hold land 'by\r\nchurch right.' Thus Offa of Mercia gave to an under-king lands at\r\nSedgebarrow 'in such wise that he might have them during his life, and\r\nin exercise of full power might leave them to be possessed by church\r\nright[900].' Thereupon the _subregulus_, as a modern English lawyer\r\nmight say, executed this power of appointment in favour of the church of\r\nWorcester. The same Offa gave land to his thegn Dudda so that by church\r\nright he might enjoy it during his life and leave it on his death to\r\nwhom he would[901].\r\n\r\n[Book-land and testament.]\r\n\r\nWe must wait for a later age before we shall find the kings freely\r\nbooking lands to their thegns without any allusion to ecclesiastical\r\npurposes. Indeed it may be said that the Anglo-Saxon land-book never\r\nceases to be an ecclesiastical instrument. True that in the tenth\r\ncentury the kings are booking lands to their thegns with great\r\nliberality; true also that there is no longer any pretence that the land\r\nso booked will go to endow a church; but let us observe these books and\r\nlet us not ignore the recitals that they contain. Why does the king make\r\nthese grants? He says that it is because he hopes for an eternal reward\r\nin the everlasting mansions. This has perhaps become an empty phrase:\r\nbut it has a history. Also it is needed in order to make the deed a\r\nlogical whole. Let us observe the sequence of the clauses:--'Whereas the\r\nfashion of this world passeth away but the joys of heaven are eternal;\r\ntherefore I give land to my thegn so that he may enjoy it during his\r\nlife and leave it on his death to whomsoever he pleases, and if any one\r\nshall come against this charter may he perish for ever; I have confirmed\r\nthis gift with the sign of Christ's holy cross[902].' Some piety in the\r\nharangue (_arenga_) is necessary in order to lead up to the anathema and\r\nthe cross; it justifies the intervention of the bishops, who also will\r\nmake crosses and thereby will be denouncing the church's ban against any\r\none who violates the charter. And who, we may ask, is likely to violate\r\nthe charter? The donee's kinsfolk may be tempted to do this if the donee\r\nmakes use of that testamentary power which has been granted to him (as,\r\nfor instance, by leaving the land to a church) more especially because\r\nit may be very doubtful whether in impeaching such a testament they will\r\nnot have the folk-law on their side. Such in brief outline is--so we\r\nthink--the history of book-land. It is land (or rather in many cases a\r\nsuperiority) held by royal privilege[903] under the sanction of the\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [858] Heming's Cartulary was published by Hearne.

The charter is of\r\n        fairly good repute, but nothing that comes from Evesham is\r\n        beyond suspicion. It is almost impossible to translate these\r\n        early books without making their language too definite. How,\r\n        for instance shall we render 'nulli, neque principi, neque\r\n        praefecto, neque tiranno alicui pascui constituantur'?\r\n\r\n  [886] Ine, 70, § 1.\r\n\r\n  [887] Thorpe, Gloss, s. v. _Foster_, thinks that this law has to do\r\n        with the fostering of a child. Schmid is inclined to hold that\r\n        it speaks of a rent payable to a landlord.\r\n\r\n  [888] Ine, 64-6: 'He who has 20 hides must show 12 hides of\r\n        cultivated land if he wishes to go away. He who has 10 hides\r\n        shall show 6 hides of cultivated land. He who has 3 hides let\r\n        him show one and a half.' The persons with whom these laws\r\n        deal are certainly not _ascripti glebae_; they are very great\r\n        men. Then we must read c. 63: 'If a gesithcundman go away,\r\n        then may he have his reeve with him and his smith and his\r\n        child's fosterer'; and then c. 68: 'If a gesithcundman be\r\n        driven off, let him be driven from the dwelling (botle), not\r\n        from the set land (naes þaere setene).' The king's gesiths\r\n        have been taking up large grants of waste land and putting\r\n        under-tenants on the soil. These great folk must not fling up\r\n        their holdings until they have brought the land into\r\n        cultivation. If they do abandon their land, they may take away\r\n        with them only three of their dependants. If they are evicted\r\n        by some adverse claimant this is not to harm their\r\n        under-tenants; they are to be driven from the _botl_, that is\r\n        from the chief house, but not from the land that they have set\r\n        out to husbandmen. These last are to enjoy a secure title. We\r\n        must leave to linguists the question whether we have rightly\r\n        understood the difficult _seten_; but these chapters, together\r\n        with c. 67, which deals with the relations between these lords\r\n        and their husbandmen, seem to point to some great scheme for\r\n        colonizing a newly-conquered district.\r\n\r\n  [889] Kemble, Saxons, i. 294-8; ii. 58.\r\n\r\n  [890] Karl Lehmann, Abhandlungen zur Germanischen Rechtsgeschichte,\r\n        1888; Liber Census Daniae, ed. O. Nielsen, 1879.\r\n\r\n  [891] Cnut's law (II. 62) about this matter seems to imply that in\r\n        consequence of the immunities lavishly bestowed by his\r\n        predecessors, the old 'king's _feorm_' was only leviable from\r\n        lands which were deemed to be the king's lands, but that\r\n        Cnut's reeves had been demanding that this _feorm_ should be\r\n        supplemented by other lands. The king of his grace forbids\r\n        them to do this. The old _feorm_ has been changed into a rent\r\n        of crown lands; a vague claim to 'purveyance' is abolished,\r\n        but will appear again after the Conquest.\r\n\r\n  [892] In the A.-S.

It becomes a philosophic reflection on the\r\n        transitoriness of earthly affairs and finally evaporates,\r\n        leaving behind some commonplace about the superiority of\r\n        written over unwritten testimony.\r\n\r\n  [903] Bede (ed. Plummer, i. 415): 'ipsas quoque litteras\r\n        privilegiorum suorum.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Book-land and Folk-land._\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is folk-land?]\r\n\r\nWith 'book-land' is contrasted 'folk-land.' Therefore of folk-land a few\r\nwords must be said. What is folk-land? A few years ago the answer that\r\nhistorians gave to this question was this: It is the land of the folk,\r\nthe land belonging to the folk. Dr Vinogradoff has argued that this is\r\nnot the right answer[904]. His argument has convinced us; but, as it is\r\nstill new, we will take leave to repeat it with some few additions of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n[Folk-land in the texts.]\r\n\r\nThe term 'folk-land' occurs but thrice in our texts. It occurs in one\r\nlaw and in two charters. The one law comes from Edward the Elder[905]\r\nand all that it tells us is that folk-land is the great contrast to\r\nbook-land. Folk-land and book-land seem to cover the whole field of land\r\ntenure. Possibly this law tells us also that while a dispute about\r\nfolk-land will, a dispute about book-land will not, come before the\r\nshiremoot:--but we hardly obtain even this information[906]. Then we\r\nhave the two charters. Of these the earlier is a deed of Æthelbert of\r\nKent dated in 858[907]. The king with the consent of his great men and\r\nof the prelates gives to his thegn Wulflaf five plough-lands at\r\nWashingwell (_aliquam partem terrae iuris mei_) in exchange for land at\r\nMarsham. He declares that the land at Washingwell is to be free from\r\nall burdens save the three usually excepted, the land at Marsham having\r\nenjoyed a similar immunity. The boundaries of Washingwell are then\r\nstated. On the west it is bounded by the king's folk-land (_cyninges\r\nfolcland_) which Wighelm and Wulflaf have. So much for the deed itself.\r\nOn its back there is an endorsement to the following effect: 'This is\r\nthe land-book for Washingwell that Æthelbert the king granted to Wulflaf\r\nhis thegn in exchange for an equal amount of other land at Marsham; the\r\nking granted and booked to Wulflaf five sullungs of land at Washingwell\r\nfor the five sullungs at Marsham and the king made that land at Marsham\r\nhis folk-land (\"did it him to folk-land\") when they had exchanged the\r\nlands, save the marshes and the salterns at Faversham and the woods that\r\nbelong to the salterns.' Now this deed teaches us that there was land\r\nwhich was known as 'the king's folk-land,' and that it was in the\r\noccupation of two men called Wighelm and Wulflaf, the latter of whom may\r\nwell have been the Wulflaf who made an exchange with the king. The\r\nendorsement tells us that when the king received the land at Marsham he\r\nmade it his folk-land, 'he did it him to folk-land.'\r\n\r\n[The will of Alfred the Ealdorman.]\r\n\r\nThe other charter is of greater value. It is the will of the Ealdorman\r\nAlfred and comes from some year late in the ninth century[908]. He\r\ndesires in the first place to state who are the persons to whom he gives\r\nhis inheritance and his book-land. He then gives somewhat more than 100\r\nhides, including 6 at Lingfield and 10 at Horsley, to his wife for her\r\nlife, 'with remainder,' as we should say, to their daughter. More than\r\nonce he calls this daughter 'our common bairn,' thus drawing attention\r\nto the fact that she is not merely his daughter, but also his wife's\r\ndaughter. This is of importance, for in a later clause we hear of a son.\r\n'I give to my son Æthelwald three hides of book-land: two hides on\r\nHwætedune [Waddon], and one at Gatatune [Gatton] and therewith 100\r\nswine, and, if the king will grant him the folk-land with the book-land,\r\nthen let him have and enjoy it: but if this may not be, then let her [my\r\nwife] grant to him whichever she will, either the land at Horsley or the\r\nland at Lingfield.' Such are the materials which must provide us with\r\nour knowledge of folk-land.\r\n\r\n[Comment on Alfred's will.]\r\n\r\nWe must examine Alfred's will somewhat carefully. The testator has a\r\nwife, a son, a daughter. He leaves the bulk of his book-land to his wife\r\nfor life with remainder to his daughter. For his son he makes a small\r\nprovision (only three hides) out of his book-land, but he expresses a\r\nwish that the king will let that son have the folk-land, and, if this\r\nwish be not fulfilled, then that son is to have either ten or else six\r\nhides out of the book-land previously given to the wife and daughter. We\r\nsee that, even if he gets these few hides, the son will obtain but a\r\nsmall part of a handsome fortune. 'If the king will grant him the\r\nfolk-land'--this may suggest that a man's folk-land will not descend to\r\nhis heir. But another, and, as it seems to us, a far more probable\r\nexplanation is open. The son is 'my son,' the daughter is 'our common\r\nbairn.' May not the son be illegitimate, or may not his legitimacy be\r\ndoubtful, for legitimacy is somewhat a matter of degree? The ealdorman\r\nmay have contracted a dubious or a morganatic marriage. We can see that\r\nhe does not feel called upon to do very much for this son of his. He\r\nexpresses a hope that the king as supreme judge will hold the son to be\r\nlegitimate, or sufficiently legitimate to inherit the folk-land, which\r\nhe does not endeavour to bequeath.\r\n\r\n[The king booking land to himself.]\r\n\r\nThe king like other persons can have both folk-land, and book-land. We\r\nhave just heard of 'the king's folk-land': we turn to the important deed\r\nwhereby King Æthelwulf booked land to himself[909]. Alms, it says, are\r\nthe most perdurable of possessions; one ought to minister to the\r\nnecessities of others and so make to oneself friends of the mammon of\r\nunrighteousness; therefore I King Æthelwulf with the consent and leave\r\nof my bishops and great men have booked to myself twenty manses so that\r\nI may enjoy them and leave them after my death to whomsoever I please in\r\nperpetuity: the land is to be free from all tribute and the like, save\r\nmilitary service and the repair of bridges. Then the description of the\r\nland thus booked is preceded by the statement: 'These are the lands\r\nwhich his wise men (_senatores_) conceded to Æthelwulf.' Now the full\r\nmeaning of this famous instrument we can not yet discuss. To put it\r\nbriefly, our explanation will be that over his book-land the king will\r\nhave powers which he will not have over his folk-land; in particular he\r\nwill have that testamentary power which will enable him to become\r\nfriendly with the mammon of unrighteousness and secure those eternal\r\nmansions that he desires. But we have introduced this charter here\r\nbecause, though it says no word of folk-land, it forms an important part\r\nof the case of those who contend that folk-land is land belonging to the\r\npeople[910].\r\n\r\n[The consent of the witan.]\r\n\r\nAnother weighty argument is derived from the fact that there are but\r\nvery few charters of the kings which do not in some formula or another\r\nprofess that many illustrious persons have consented to or have\r\nwitnessed the making of the deed. We have no desire to detract from the\r\nsignificance of this fact, still we ought to examine our documents with\r\ncare. Such words as a charter has about 'consent' may occur in two\r\ndifferent contexts. They may occur in close connexion with the words of\r\ngift, 'the operative words,' as our conveyancers say, or they may occur\r\nin the eschatocol, the clause which deals with the execution and\r\nattestation of the instrument. If we come across two deeds, one of which\r\ntells us how 'I king Æthelwulf with the consent and leave of my bishops\r\nand great men give land to a church or a thegn,' while the other says\r\nnothing of consent until it tells us how 'This charter was written on\r\nsuch a day _his testibus consentientibus_,' we must not at once treat\r\nthem as saying the same thing in two different ways.\r\n\r\n[Consent and witness in the land-books.]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose we may divide our charters into three periods. The\r\nfirst begins with the few genuine charters of the seventh century and\r\nends in the reign of Egbert, the second endures until the reign of\r\nEdward the Elder, the third until the Norman Conquest. It will be well\r\nunderstood that we draw no hard line; each period has its penumbra; but\r\nthe years 800 and 900 or 925 may serve to mark very rudely the two\r\nlimits of the middle period. Now a clause in the body of the deed\r\nstating that the gift is made by the consent of the witan is\r\ncharacteristic of this middle period. Any one who wishes to forge a\r\nroyal land-book of the ninth century should insert this clause; any one\r\nwho wishes to forge a deed of the tenth or of the eighth century should\r\nthink twice before he makes use of it. To be more exact, it becomes a\r\ncommon form under Cenwulf of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex; it grows very\r\nrare under Æthelstan[911]. In the meanwhile it serves as a common form,\r\nand it appears in deeds wherein the king says in forcible terms that he\r\nis disposing of his land and his inheritance[912]. During the last of\r\nour three periods all that is ascribed to the great men whose crosses\r\nfollow the king's cross is little, if anything, more than the function\r\nof witnesses. A deed of Æthelstan's day will end with some such formula\r\nas the following: 'this book was written at such a place and time, and\r\nits authority was confirmed by the witnesses whose names are written\r\nbelow.' But very often there is no such concluding formula: we have\r\nsimply the list of witnesses and their crosses, and of each of them it\r\nis said that he consented and subscribed. Later in the tenth century the\r\nformula which introduces the names of the witnesses will hardly admit\r\nthat they in any sense confirmed the transaction; it will say merely,\r\n'This book was written on such a day _his testibus consentientibus\r\nquorum nomina inferius caraxantur_.' On this will follow the names and\r\ncrosses; and of each bishop--but not as a general rule of any other\r\nwitness--it will be said that he has done something for the stability of\r\nthe deed. To convey this information, the scribe rings the changes on a\r\nscore of Latin words--_subscripsi_, _consensi_, _consolidavi_,\r\n_corroboravi_, _confirmavi_, _conscripsi_, _consignavi_, _adquievi_,\r\n_praepinxi_, _praepunxi_, _praenotavi_, and so forth, thereby showing\r\nthat he has no very clear notion as to what it really is that the bishop\r\ndoes. But this degradation of what seems to be a formula of assent into\r\na formula of attestation has been noticed by others[913], and it is more\r\nto our purpose to examine the charters of the earliest period, for then,\r\nif at any time, the folk-land should have appeared in its true character\r\nas the land of the people.\r\n\r\n[Attestation of the earliest books.]\r\n\r\nNow during our earliest period instruments which contain in conjunction\r\nwith their operative words any allusion to the consent of the great men\r\nof the realm are exceedingly rare[914]. A commoner case is that in which\r\nthe eschatocol says something about consent. We will collect a few\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n     I have confirmed this with the sign of the holy cross with the\r\n     counsel of Laurence the bishop and of all my _principes_ and have\r\n     requested them to do the like[915].\r\n\r\n     I have impressed the sign of the holy cross and requested fit and\r\n     proper witnesses to subscribe[916].\r\n\r\n     I have confirmed this gift with my own hand and have caused fit and\r\n     proper witnesses, my companions (_commites_), to confirm and\r\n     subscribe[917].\r\n\r\nThis formula, undoubtedly of foreign origin, was common in Kent[918].\r\nFrom Wessex and the middle of the eighth century, we twice obtain a\r\nfuller form.\r\n\r\n     These things were done in such a year; and that my munificent gift\r\n     may be the more firmly established (_firmius roboretur_) we have\r\n     associated with ourselves the fit and proper witnesses and\r\n     'adstipulators' whose names and descriptions are set forth below to\r\n     subscribe and confirm this privilege of the aforesaid estate\r\n     (_praedictae possessionis privilegium_[919]).\r\n\r\nMore frequently however the document has nothing that can be called a\r\nclause of attestation. It simply gives us the names and the crosses of\r\nthe witnesses. Occasionally over against each name, or each of the most\r\nimportant names, is set some word or phrase describing this witness's\r\nact. He has subscribed, or he has consented, or he has consented and\r\nsubscribed, or perhaps he has confirmed[920].\r\n\r\n[Confirmation and attestation.]\r\n\r\nNow we ought not to draw inferences from these phrases without knowing\r\nthat in the Latin of this period such words as _confirmare_,\r\n_corroborare_, _adstipulari_ are the proper words whereby to describe\r\nthe act of those who become witnesses to the execution of a deed[921].\r\nOur kings are making use, though it is a lax use, of foreign formulas;\r\nwhat is more, they are adopting the formulas of private deeds. They have\r\nno chancellor, as the Frankish kings have, and they do not, as the\r\nFrankish kings do, dispense with that _rogatio testium_ which is one of\r\nthe usual forms of private law[922]. On the continent of Europe all this\r\ntalk about confirmation, corroboration and consent would by no means\r\nimply that the witnesses were more than witnesses. The line which\r\ndivides attestation from participation is really somewhat fine, and\r\nthough well enough apprehended by modern lawyers, would not easily be\r\nexplained to a barbarian ealdorman. A witness does consent to the\r\nexecution of the instrument which he attests, though he may be utterly\r\nignorant of its import, and, if the law demands that such an instrument\r\nshall be attested, then it may well be said of the witness that by\r\nattesting it he makes it firm, he confirms it. Until he attested it, it\r\nwas not a valid instrument[923]. Now we are not saying that the\r\nmagnates, more especially the bishops, who attested these ancient\r\ncharters thought of themselves as mere witnesses. Had that been so, a\r\nclause expressing the consent of the whole body of great men would\r\nhardly have crept into the charters; and it does creep in gradually\r\nduring the last half of the eighth century[924]. A similar development\r\nhas been noticed in the charters of the German kings. A clause\r\nexpressing the consent of the great folk rarely occurs in the\r\nMerovingian or the early Carolingian charters, unless they belong to\r\ncertain exceptional classes. It is said to become common under the weak\r\nrule of Lewis the Child; then for a while it becomes rare again, and\r\nthen once more common under Henry III and Henry IV, though consent and\r\nwitness are hardly to be distinguished[925].\r\n\r\n[Function of the witan.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps from the first in England the cross of at least one bishop was\r\nmuch to be desired or was almost indispensable, for the anathema which\r\nthe charter pronounces will be a solemn sentence of excommunication when\r\nit comes from a bishop, while it will be at best a pious wish if it\r\ncomes from the king; and it is well to have the cross of every bishop,\r\nso that the breaker of the charter may find himself excommunicated in\r\nevery diocese. This is not all; we may well believe that from the first\r\nthe king was more or less bound to consult with his great men before he\r\nalienated his land. The notion that land could be alienated at all may\r\nnot have been very ancient, and the king when giving land away may have\r\nbeen expected to pay some regard to the welfare of his realm[926]. The\r\ndiscovery that he had an alienable superiority over free land and free\r\nlandowners would sharpen this rule. Some of these early donations are to\r\nour minds more like cessions of political power than gifts of land; they\r\nmake over to bishops and abbots rights which the king has exercised\r\nrather as king than as landowner. A wholesome practice grows up which is\r\nembodied in the clause that states the consent of the witan, and, even\r\nwhen this clause has disappeared, still it is in the presence and with\r\nthe witness of his councillors that the king makes his grants. This is\r\nno purely English phenomenon. When a Norman duke hands his charter to be\r\nroborated and confirmed by his _fideles_, we do not infer that he is\r\ndisposing of land that is not his[927]. But it is very remarkable that\r\nin the earliest English charters the consent of an overlord is treated\r\nas a far more serious thing than the consent of the nobles[928].\r\n\r\n[The king and the people's land.]\r\n\r\nOf some value though this 'constitutional check' may have been, we can\r\nnot regard it as a relic of a time when there was land which in any\r\naccurate sense of the term was owned by the people. The recorded action\r\nof the witan in relation to the king's grants does not become more\r\nprominent, it becomes less prominent, as we go backwards and reach the\r\nheptarchic days. But that is not all. Is it not marvellous that there\r\nshould be land owned by the people and yet that we should have to\r\ndiscover this momentous fact from a few casual phrases occurring in\r\nthree documents of the ninth and tenth centuries? Are we to suppose that\r\nwhenever the king is giving away land, this land is the land of the\r\npeople? Why do not the charters say so? Repeatedly the king speaks of\r\nthe land that he gives as 'my land' (_terram iuris mei_), and this too\r\nin charters which state that the witan give their consent to the grant.\r\nNever by any chance does a scribe slip into any such phrase as _terram\r\ngentis meae, terram gentis Merciorum_ or the like. And how came it about\r\nthat from the very earliest time the king could devote the people's land\r\nto the salvation of his own peculiar soul? But, it will be said, no\r\ndoubt the king had private estates besides having a power over 'the\r\nunallotted lands of the nation,' and those private estates he could give\r\naway as he pleased. But then, how are we to distinguish between those\r\ncharters whereby he disposed of his own and those whereby he disposed of\r\nnational lands? The formula which expresses the consent of the wise will\r\ncertainly not serve our turn. It leads, as we have seen, to a\r\ndistinction between different ages, not to a classification of the\r\nvarious charters of one and the same king.\r\n\r\n[King's land and crown land.]\r\n\r\nSome historians have supposed that at the outset there was a clear\r\ndistinction between the king's private estates and those national lands\r\nwhich were becoming the domains of the crown. Now a vague distinction\r\nbetween what belonged to the king as king and what belonged to him--if\r\nwe may use so modern a phrase--in his private capacity, we may admit,\r\nwhile at the same time we gravely doubt whether the language or the\r\nthought of the eighth or ninth century had any forms in which this\r\ndistinction could be precisely expressed. Even within the ecclesiastical\r\nsphere, where traditions of Roman law may have lingered and where dead\r\nsaints presented themselves as persons capable of acquiring land, it was\r\nby no means easy to distinguish the bishop's property from his church's\r\nproperty. We may find a deed whereby some king for the love of God or\r\nthe salvation of his soul gives land to a certain bishop, and states in\r\nstrong, clear words that the donee is to have the most absolute power of\r\ngiving and selling and even, for this sometimes occurs, of bequeathing\r\nthe land[929]. We shall probably believe that the king intends that this\r\nland shall go to increase the territory of the church, and yet we dare\r\nnot make the bishop either 'a trustee' or 'a corporation sole.'\r\n\r\n[Fate of the king's land on his death.]\r\n\r\nAs to the king, it would be on his death that the necessity of drawing\r\nsome distinction between his two capacities would first present itself.\r\nPerhaps a brother of his would be elected to the kingdom and his\r\nchildren would be passed by. Clearly this brother should have those\r\nlands which have supplied the king with the main part of his revenue,\r\nand yet it would be hard that the dead man's children should be\r\nportionless. However, we may strongly suspect that in the earliest time\r\ncases of this nature were settled as they arose without the\r\nestablishment of any general rule, and that even on the eve of the\r\nNorman Conquest no definite classification of the king's estates had\r\nbeen framed. We dare not expect the rule to be more definite than that\r\nwhich settled the title to the kingship, and how exceedingly indefinite\r\nthe latter was the historians of our constitution have explained.\r\nHereditary and elective elements were mixed up in the title; we can\r\ndefine neither the one nor the other. That 'superiority' over all the\r\nland of his kingdom of which we have spoken above, though it might be\r\nalienated piecemeal among the living, would pass from the dead king to\r\nhis elected successor. On the other hand, some kings were careful to\r\nhave certain lands booked to themselves and to obtain from their nobles\r\n'an express power of testamentary appointment.' But very possibly there\r\nwas a wide fringe of disputable matter. King Alfred's will, with all\r\nthat he says about what had been done by himself, his father and his\r\nbrothers, seems to tell us that a prudent king would obtain the consent\r\nof his councillors to any disposition that he made of land that was in\r\nany sort his. Also it seems to bear witness to a strong feeling that the\r\nreigning king should enjoy at any rate the bulk of the lands that his\r\npredecessor had enjoyed[930].\r\n\r\n[The new king and the old king's heir.]\r\n\r\nIn one of his charters Æthelred the Unready is made to tell a long and\r\ncurious story[931]:--'My father, king Edgar, gave certain lands to the\r\nminster at Abingdon. On his death the wise men elected as king my\r\nbrother Edward, and put me in possession of the lands which belonged to\r\nthe king's sons. Among these were the lands given to Abingdon; they were\r\nforcibly taken from the monks. Whether this was lawful or unlawful those\r\nwise men know best. Then my brother Edward died and I became possessed,\r\nnot only of the lands which belonged to the king's sons, but also of the\r\nroyal lands. I do not wish to incur my father's curse, and therefore I\r\nintend to substitute for his gift a compensation out of my own proper\r\ninheritance. The land that I am now going to dispose of I acquired by\r\ngift from certain persons whose names I state.'--We seem to see here\r\nthree kinds of land, the _regales terrae_ which pass from king to king,\r\nthe lands 'entailed,' if we may use that term, on the king's family\r\n(_regii pueri_), and lands which come to a king by way of gift or the\r\nlike and constitute his _propria hereditas_. But the wise men seem to\r\nhave violated three solemn books which they themselves or their\r\npredecessors had attested, and we can but say with king Æthelred '_quam\r\nrem si iuste aut iniuste fecerint ipsi sciant_[932].' There can be but\r\nlittle law about such matters so long as the title to the kingship is\r\nindefinable[933].\r\n\r\n[Ancient demesne and its immunity.]\r\n\r\nThis distinction between the lands which would pass from king to king\r\nand the lands which would pass from the king to his heirs or to his\r\ndevisees may have been complicated with another distinction. Domesday\r\nBook tells us that some, but by no means all, of the lands held by the\r\nConfessor were and had always been free of geld, and this freedom from\r\ntaxation may imply other immunities. It is possible that, as in later\r\ntimes, certain 'ancient demesnes of the crown' already stood outside the\r\nnational system of taxation, justice and police, that the ealdorman of\r\nthe shire and the shire-moot had no jurisdiction over them, and that\r\nthey were administered by reeves yet more personally dependent on the\r\nking than was the shire-reeve. It is possible, however, that the two\r\ndistinctions cut each other, for when the king booked land to himself\r\nhe, at all events on some occasions, inserted in the charter a clause of\r\nimmunity, the very object of which was to put the land outside the\r\ngeneral, national system. To this distinction the famous exchange which\r\nÆthelbert effected with his thegn Wulflaf may point. It says that when,\r\ninstead of Washingwell, the king accepted Marsham, 'he did it him to\r\nfolk-land.' The land at Marsham was no longer to enjoy that immunity\r\nwhich it had enjoyed while it was in the hands of the thegn, it was to\r\ncome under the sway of the sheriff and of the national courts. However,\r\nit is much easier for us to dream dreams about such a transaction than\r\nto discover the truth.\r\n\r\n[Rights of individuals in national land.]\r\n\r\nIf the folk-land was the land of the people and if the king when he\r\nbooked land to a church or a thegn was usually booking folk-land and\r\nconverting it into book-land, how are we to think of the land that still\r\nis folk-land? Is it land that has not yet been brought into cultivation;\r\nis it land in which no proprietary interests, save that of the folk,\r\nexist? Now we are far from saying that the king never grants land that\r\nis waste and void of inhabitants; but it is plain enough that this is\r\nnot the common case. The charter deals in the first instance with\r\nmanses, _villae_, _vici_, houses, túns, with cultivated fields and\r\nmeadows. Waste land (it may be) is given in large quantities, but merely\r\nas appurtenant to the profitable core of the gift. We see too that\r\nindividual men have rights in the folk-land; Alfred the ealdorman has\r\nfolk-land and hopes that on his death it will pass to his son; King\r\nÆthelbert has folk-land and it is occupied by Wighelm and Wulflaf; King\r\nEdward the Elder supposes that the title to folk-land may be in dispute\r\nbetween two persons and that this dispute will come before the sheriff.\r\nWhat then the folk owns, if it owns anything at all, is not (if we may\r\nintroduce such feudal terms) 'land in demesne' but 'land in service,' in\r\nother words, a superiority or seignory over land. We must add that it is\r\na superiority over free men and over men who have titles that can be the\r\nsubject of law-suits in the county court. And now we must ask, What\r\nprofit does the nation get out of this superiority? Shall we say that\r\nthe _tributum_, the _vectigal_ paid to the king is to be regarded as\r\nrent paid to the nation, that the _opera regia_, the _victus_, the\r\n_pastus_, are services rendered by the tenant to the people, or shall we\r\nsay that the folk's right over this land is proved by its serving as the\r\nfund whereon the king can draw when he desires to save his soul? Then,\r\nif on the other hand we make the tillers of the folk-land mere tenants\r\nat will, there will be little room left for any landowners, for any\r\n'peasant proprietors.' To meet this difficulty it has been supposed\r\nthat, at all events at a remote time, there was much land that was\r\nneither folk-land nor book-land. The allotments which the original\r\nsettlers received were neither folk-land nor book-land.\r\n\r\n[The _alod_.]\r\n\r\nIn order to describe those allotments the words _alod_ and _ethel_ have\r\nbeen used, and other terms, such as 'family land' and 'heir land,' have\r\nbeen invented. But in the laws and the charters we do not meet with\r\nthese phrases. The law of Edward the Elder seems to set before us\r\nbook-land and folk-land as exhausting the kinds of land. 'He who\r\ndeforces any one of his right, be it in book-land, be it in 'folk-land'\r\nmust pay a penalty. It is difficult to believe that this law says\r\nnothing of one very common kind of land, still more difficult to believe\r\nthat already in the first half of the ninth century the amount of the\r\nso-called _alod_, _ethel_, or 'heir-land,' had become so small that it\r\nmight be neglected. So far as we can see, book-land from first to last\r\nwas only held by the churches and by very great men. The books that we\r\nhave, more especially the later books, are with hardly any exceptions\r\nfurnished with clauses of immunity, clauses which put the land outside\r\nthe national system of police, and, as we think, of justice also. It is\r\nnot to be imagined for one moment that the numerous _liberi homines_ who\r\neven in the Conqueror's reign held land in Essex and East Anglia had\r\nbooks. To say that book-land had consumed the ancient _alod_ or _ethel_,\r\nis in truth to say that all land was privileged.\r\n\r\n[Book-land and privilege.]\r\n\r\nWe turn once more to Edward's law. Land, it would seem, is either\r\nbook-land or folk-land. Book-land is land held by book, by a royal and\r\necclesiastical _privilegium_. Folk-land is land held without book, by\r\nunwritten title, by the folk-law. 'Folk-land' is the term which modern\r\nhistorians have rejected in favour of the outlandish _alod_. The holder\r\nof folk-land is a free landowner, though at an early date the king\r\ndiscovers that over him and his land there exists an alienable\r\nsuperiority. Partly by alienations of this superiority, partly perhaps\r\nby gifts of land of which the king is himself the owner, book-land is\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n[Kinds of land and kinds of right.]\r\n\r\nEdward's law speaks as though it were dealing with two different kinds\r\nof land. But really it is dealing with two different kinds of title. We,\r\nand even our statutes, habitually speak of freehold land, copyhold land,\r\nleasehold land, yet we know that the same piece of land may be at one\r\nand the same time freehold, copyhold and leasehold. All land is freehold\r\nland; every rood has its freeholder. Bracton habitually spoke of land\r\nheld by frankalmoin, land held by knight's service, land held in socage,\r\nbut he knew well enough that a single acre might be held at one and the\r\nsame time by many different tenures. Just so, we take it, the same land\r\nmight be both book-land and folk-land, the book-land of the minster, the\r\nfolk-land of the free men who were holding--not indeed 'of'--but still\r\n'under' the minster. They or their ancestors had held under the king,\r\nbut the king had booked their land (which also in a certain sense was\r\nhis land) to a church. The mental effort, the abstraction, that would\r\nbe required of us were we to speak of various 'estates, rights and\r\ntitles,' we try to avoid by speaking as though the distinction that was\r\nto be indicated were a distinction between various material things, and\r\nas though a freehold or copyhold quality were, like fertility or\r\nsterility, an attribute of the soil. Even so abstract a term as 'estate'\r\nis soon debased by the vulgar mouth: estates are ploughed; men 'shoot\r\nover' their estates. 'Book-land' is a briefer term than 'land held by\r\nbook-right'; 'folk-land' is a briefer term than 'land held by\r\nfolk-right.' The same piece of land may be held by book-right and by\r\nfolk-right; it may be book-land and folk-land too.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must turn to consider another element in the king's alienable\r\nsuperiority. We must speak of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [904] Vinogradoff, Folkland, Eng. Hist. Rev. viii. 1.\r\n\r\n  [905] Edw.

Hist. i. 145.\r\n\r\n  [911] From Alfred and Edward the Elder we have hardly enough genuine\r\n        charters to serve as materials for an induction, but Edward's\r\n        reign seems the turning point.\r\n\r\n  [912] A.D. 838, K. 1044 (v. 90): Egbert gives 'aliquantulam terrae\r\n        partem meae propriae hereditatis ... cum consilio et\r\n        testimonio optimatum meorum.' A.D. 863, K. 1059 (v. 116):\r\n        Æthelred 'cum consensu ac licentia episcoporum ac principum\r\n        meorum' gives 'aliquam partem agri quae ad me rite\r\n        pertinebat.'\r\n\r\n  [913] Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. 212.\r\n\r\n  [914] We know of but four specimens earlier than 750. The first is a\r\n        deed whereby Wulfhere of Mercia makes a grant 'cum consensu et\r\n        licentia amicorum et optimatum meorum': E. 4; B. M. Facs. iv.\r\n        1. The second is a deed whereby Hlothar of Kent makes a grant\r\n        with the consent of Abp Theodore, his (Hlothar's) brother's\r\n        son Eadric and all the princes; K. 16 (i. 20); B. M. Facs. i.\r\n        1. The third, known to us only through a copy, is one by which\r\n        Æthelbald of Mercia makes a grant 'cum consensu vel\r\n        episcoporum vel optimatum meorum'; K. 83 (i. 100). By a fourth\r\n        deed, K. 27 (i. 30), Eadric grants land 'cum consensu meorum\r\n        patriciorum'; but this also we only get from a copy.\r\n\r\n  [915] K. 1 (i. 1); A.D. 604.

Of this deed we\r\n        have but a transcript. The formula of attestation is very\r\n        curious and may have been distorted either by the original\r\n        scribe or the copyist.\r\n\r\n  [918] K. 157 (i. 189), Offa of Mercia uses this eschatocol, but in a\r\n        Kentish gift.\r\n\r\n  [919] K. 1006-7 (v. 47-8); B. i. 256-7.\r\n\r\n  [920] K. 79 (i. 95).\r\n\r\n  [921] Brunner, Rechtsgeschichte der Röm. u.

It occurs also in a charter of 791, K.\r\n        1015 (v. 53-4). See also K. 691 (iii. 289), 'constipulatores.'\r\n\r\n  [922] Brunner, op. cit. 158. Dr Brunner thinks that the precedents\r\n        for A.-S. charters came direct from Rome rather than from any\r\n        other quarter (p. 187); but he fully admits that these\r\n        charters when compared with foreign instruments show a certain\r\n        formlessness.\r\n\r\n  [923] Under our own law we may conceive a case in which a man would\r\n        be compelled to die unwillingly intestate because one of the\r\n        two people present at his death-bed capriciously refused to\r\n        witness a will.\r\n\r\n  [924] The transition is marked by the following charters.--K. 104,\r\n        105, 108, 113, in these we have the mere rogation of fit and\r\n        proper witnesses.--K. 114 (a Kentish deed which Kemble\r\n        ascribes to 759-765), in this the clause of attestation speaks\r\n        of the counsel and consent of the _optimates_ and\r\n        _principes_.--K. 118, Uhtred of the Hwiccas makes a grant with\r\n        the consent and licence of Offa king of the Mercians and of\r\n        his (Offa's) bishops and _principes_.--K. 120, the witnesses\r\n        are described as _condonantes_.--K. 121, 122, (A.D. 774) the\r\n        clause of attestation says 'cum sacerdotibus et senioribus\r\n        populi more testium subscribendo.'--K. 131, 'testium ergo et\r\n        consentientium episcoporum ac principum meorum signa et nomina\r\n        pro firmitatis stabilimento hic infra notabo.'--A clause of\r\n        this kind becomes common with Offa, see K. 134, 137, 138, 148,\r\n        151, but occasionally there are relapses and the signatories\r\n        merely appear as 'fit and proper' or 'religious' witnesses.\r\n        But it is not until after 800 that, save as a rare exception,\r\n        the consent of the magnates is brought into connexion with the\r\n        operative words.\r\n\r\n  [925] Bresslau, Urkundenlehre, i. 697.\r\n\r\n  [926] Bede's letter to Egbert (ed.

Then again, on Æthelbert's death,\r\n        Alfred would not insist upon a partition but allowed his share\r\n        to remain in the possession of Æthelred, the reigning king.\r\n        See also Eadred's will, Liber de Hyda, 153; he seems to have a\r\n        good deal of land of which he can dispose freely.\r\n\r\n  [931] K. 1312 (vi. 172).\r\n\r\n  [932] The violated books are in Chron.

For example, we\r\n        should raise a question which in all probability has no\r\n        answer, were we to ask whether a majority could bind a\r\n        minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Sake and Soke._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Importance of seignorial justice.]\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena of feudalism none seems more essential than\r\nseignorial justice. In times gone by English lawyers and historians have\r\nbeen apt to treat it lightly and to concentrate their attention on\r\nmilitary tenure. For them 'the introduction of the military tenures' has\r\nbeen 'the establishment of the feudal system.' But when compared with\r\nseignorial justice, military tenure is a superficial matter, one out of\r\nmany effects rather than a deep-seated cause. Seignorial justice is a\r\ndeep-seated cause of many effects, a principle which when once\r\nintroduced is capable of transfiguring a nation. Of the origin and\r\nantiquity of this principle, however, some even of our most illustrious\r\nhistorians have spoken with great hesitation and therefore we shall\r\nspend some time in examining the texts which reveal what can be known\r\nabout it, admitting once for all that they leave much room for\r\ndifferences of opinion.\r\n\r\n[Theory of the modern origin of seignorial justice.]\r\n\r\nSince the doctrine to which we have come would trace seignorial justice\r\nback to a remote time, we shall do well to state at the outset an\r\nextreme version of the opposite doctrine, a version which has been\r\nelaborately set forth in a learned and spirited essay[934].--On the eve\r\nof the battle of Hastings a seignorial court was still a new thing in\r\nEngland. It was a Norman precursor of the Norman Conquest. England owes\r\nit to Edward the Confessor, who was 'half-Norman by birth and wholly\r\nNorman by education and sympathies.' It came to us with 'a new theory of\r\nconstitutional law.' From the reign of no older king can any evidence be\r\nproduced of the existence--at any rate of the legalized existence--of\r\nprivate courts. True, there are charters that give to the holders of\r\ngreat estates the profits of jurisdiction; but a grant of the profits of\r\njurisdiction is one thing, jurisdiction itself is another. True, that\r\none man might have _soke_ over another, but this does not mean that he\r\nhad jurisdiction; at the most it means that he was entitled to the\r\nprofits of justice, to wites, to fines and amercements. 'No instance can\r\nbe found before the Norman times in which _sócn_ means jurisdiction.\r\n_Sócn_ had a technical meaning of its own which is always rigorously\r\nobserved. The idea of jurisdiction, on the other hand, was expressed by\r\nan equally technical word, the meaning of which is also rigorously\r\nobserved. This is _sacu_, a word which has strangely vanished from our\r\nlegal vocabulary, but is still preserved, even in its technical sense,\r\nby the German _sache_[935].'\r\n\r\n[Sake and soke in the Norman age.]\r\n\r\nNow it will not be disputed that in Domesday Book and the Leges Henrici\r\nthis distinction is obliterated. _Soke_ means jurisdiction and '_sake_\r\nand _soke_' is but a pleonastic phrase, which means no more than\r\n_soke_[936]. Nor is it disputable that on the vigil of the Conquest a\r\ngreat deal of jurisdiction was wielded by the lords. Not a few of the\r\n'hundreds' were in private hands, and, apart from hundredal\r\njurisdiction, a lord might have and often had sake and soke over his own\r\nlands. It is not denied that Edward the Confessor had freely granted to\r\nchurches and other lords large rights of justice,--not merely rights to\r\nthe profits of jurisdiction, but jurisdiction itself. The question is\r\nwhether what he did was new.\r\n\r\n[The Confessor's writs.]\r\n\r\nFor one moment longer we may dwell on the indisputable fact that he\r\ndealt out jurisdictional rights with a lavish hand. This we gather, not\r\nso much from his Latin land-books, as from English writs in which he\r\nannounces to the bishop, earl, sheriff and great men of a county that he\r\nhas given land in that county to some church 'with sake and soke and\r\ntoll and team'; sometimes he adds 'with infangennethef, grithbrice,\r\nforesteal, hamsocn, flymena-fyrmth,' and so forth. Sometimes the donees\r\nare to have these rights in all their own lands. Sometimes he gives them\r\nthe hundredal jurisdiction over lands that are not their own. Thus to\r\nSt. Benet of Ramsey he gives soken over all the men in a hundred and a\r\nhalf--over all the men who are 'moot-worthy, fyrd-worthy, and\r\nfold-worthy,' whosesoever men they may be: that is to say (as we\r\nunderstand it) he gives a jurisdiction over all the free men of the\r\ndistrict, the men who attend the moots, who attend the host and who are\r\nnot compelled by any _soca faldae_ to send their sheep to a seignorial\r\nfold, and this although those men be bound to St. Benet neither by\r\ntenure nor by personal commendation[937]. Again, he concedes that the\r\ndonee's tenants shall be quit of shires and hundreds[938]. Again, he\r\ngives the favoured church taxational power: whenever the king takes a\r\ngeld, be it army-geld, or ship-geld, the monks may impose a similar tax\r\nupon the township and keep the proceeds to their own use[939]. In short,\r\nit seems not too much to say that any delegation and appropriation of\r\njustice of which our Norman kings were guilty had an ample warrant in\r\nthe practice of St. Edward.\r\n\r\n[Cnut's practice.]\r\n\r\nNow the theory which would make him an innovator in this matter receives\r\na rude shock from a writ of Cnut[940]. The king announces that the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury is to be worthy throughout his lands of his\r\nsake and soke and grithbrice, hamsocn, foresteal, infangennethef and\r\nflymena-fyrmth. Until the genuineness of this writ, which does not\r\nstand quite alone[941], be disproved, the charge that has been brought\r\nagainst Edward fails. He was but following in the steps of the great\r\nDane, though it may be that he rushed forward where his predecessor had\r\ntrod cautiously.\r\n\r\n[Cnut's law.]\r\n\r\nHaving seen what Cnut could do upon occasion, we turn to the famous\r\npassage in his dooms which declares what 'rights the king has over all\r\nmen[942].' In Wessex and Mercia (in the Danelaw the list is somewhat\r\ndifferent) he has hamsocn, foresteal, flymena-fyrmth and fyrd-wite\r\n'unless he will honour a man yet further and grant him this worship.'\r\nNow if we had not before us his writ for the archbishop, we might\r\nperhaps argue that this law merely decreed that the profits of certain\r\npleas were not to be covered by the 'farms' paid to the king by the\r\nsheriffs and other national officers. But in the writ we see that Cnut\r\nallows to the archbishop just the excepted rights, just that 'worship'\r\nwhich men are not to have as a general rule. Nor surely can we say that\r\nwhat is conceded is, not jurisdiction itself, but merely the profits of\r\njurisdiction. The archbishop is to have _sake_ as well as _soke_, and\r\nthose who have contended for the strictest interpretation of royal\r\ngrants have not contended that the former of these words can mean\r\nanything but 'causes,' 'pleas,' 'jurisdiction.' Therefore when it is\r\ninterpreted by the aid of this writ, Cnut's law seems to imply that\r\nprivate jurisdiction is a common thing. The king is already compelled to\r\nprotest that there are certain pleas of the crown that are not covered\r\nby vague and general words.\r\n\r\n[The book and the writ.]\r\n\r\nNow express grants of _sake_ and _soke_ first become apparent to us in\r\ndocuments of a certain class, a class that we do not get before the last\r\nyears of the tenth century. It is necessary therefore that we should\r\nmake a short digression into the region of 'diplomatics.' The\r\ninstruments of the Confessor's reign, and we may add of the Norman\r\nreigns, which we loosely call royal charters or royal land-books divide\r\nthemselves somewhat easily into two main classes, which we will call\r\nrespectively (1) charters and (2) writs. These names are not very happy,\r\nstill they are the best that occur to us. If we have regard to the form\r\nof the instrument, the distinction is evident. The charter is with rare\r\nexceptions in Latin. It begins with an invocation of the Triune God or\r\nperhaps with a sacred monogram. On the other hand, there is no address\r\nto mortal men; there is no salutation. There follow a pious _arenga_\r\nsetting forth how good a thing it is to make gifts, how desirable it is,\r\nsince men are very wicked, that transactions should be put into writing.\r\nThen the king states that he gives, or has given, or will give--the use\r\nof the future tense is not uncommon--certain land to a certain person.\r\nThen comes a clause which we shall hereafter call 'the clause of\r\nimmunity':--the land is to be free from certain burdens. Then comes the\r\nanathema or damnatory clause, threatening all breakers of the charter\r\nwith excommunication here and torment hereafter. Then in the charters of\r\nthe time before the Conquest the boundaries of the land are described in\r\nEnglish. Then comes the sign of the cross touched by the king's hand and\r\nthe crosses of the witan or nobles who 'attest' or 'attest and consent\r\nto' the grant. In the writ all is otherwise. In the Confessor's day it\r\nis usually, in the Norman reigns it is sometimes, an English document.\r\nIt begins, not with an invocation, but with a salutation;--the king\r\ngreets his subjects or some class of his subjects: King Edward greets\r\n'Herman bishop and Harold earl and all my thegns in Dorset,' or 'Leofwin\r\nbishop and Edwin earl and all my thegns in Staffordshire':--and then he\r\ntells them something. He tells them that he has granted lands or\r\nliberties to a certain person. There follows a command or a threat--'I\r\ncommand and firmly enjoin that none shall disturb the grantee,' 'I will\r\nnot suffer that any man wrong the grantee.' The boundaries are not\r\ndescribed. There is seldom any curse. The king makes no cross. If any\r\nwitnesses are mentioned, they are few and they do not make crosses.\r\n\r\n[Differences between book and writ.]\r\n\r\nNow these formal differences correspond more or less exactly to a\r\nsubstantial difference. As every modern lawyer knows, a written document\r\nmay stand in one of two relations to a legal transaction. On the one\r\nhand it may itself be the transaction: that is to say, the act of\r\nsigning, or of signing and delivering, the document may be the act by\r\nwhich certain rights are created or transferred. On the other hand, the\r\ninstrument may be but evidence of the transaction. Perhaps the law may\r\nsay that of such a transaction it will receive no evidence save a\r\ndocument written and signed; perhaps it may say that the testimony of\r\ndocuments is not to be contradicted by word of mouth; but still the\r\ndocument is only evidence, though it may be incontrovertible evidence,\r\nof the transaction; the transaction may have been complete before the\r\ndocument was signed[943]. This material distinction is likely to express\r\nitself in points of form; for instance, such a phrase as 'I hereby give'\r\nis natural in the one case; such a phrase as 'Know all men by this\r\nwriting that I have given' is appropriate in the other. Instruments of\r\nboth kinds were well enough known in the Frankish kingdom; their history\r\nhas been traced back into the history of Roman conveyancing[944]. It\r\nwould be out of place were we here to discuss the question whether the\r\nAnglo-Saxon land-book was a dispositive or merely an evidential\r\ndocument; suffice it to say that with rare exceptions the instruments\r\nthat are of earlier date than the Confessor's reign are in form charters\r\nand not writs. On the other hand, the documents of the Angevin kings\r\nwhich treat of gifts of lands and liberties, though we call them\r\ncharters, are in form (if we adopt the classification here made) not\r\ncharters but writs. In form they are evidential rather than dispositive;\r\nthey are addressed to certain persons--all the king's lieges or a class\r\nof the lieges--bidding them take notice that the king has done\r\nsomething, has given lands, and then adding some command or some threat.\r\nThis command or threat makes them more than evidential documents; the\r\n_Sciatis me dedisse_ is followed by a _Quare volo et firmiter\r\npraecipio_; it is not for no purpose that the king informs his officers\r\nor his subjects of his having made a gift; still in form they are\r\nletters, open letters, 'letters patent,' and the points of difference\r\nbetween the Angevin charter and the Angevin 'letters patent' (strictly\r\nand properly so called) are few, technical and unimportant when compared\r\nwith the points of difference which mark off these two classes of\r\ndocuments from the ancient land-book[945]. In short before the end of\r\nthe twelfth century, the writ-form or letter-form with its salutation,\r\nits 'Know ye,' its air of conveying information coupled with commands,\r\nhas entirely supplanted the true charter-form with its dispositive words\r\nand its air of not merely witnessing, but actually being, a gift of\r\nland.\r\n\r\n[Anglo-Saxon writs.]\r\n\r\nBut to represent this as a contrast between English instruments and\r\nNorman or French instruments would be a mistake. In the first place, we\r\nhave a few documents in writ-form that are older than the days of the\r\nNorman-hearted Edward. As already said, we have a writ from Cnut and it\r\nhas all those features of Edward's writs which have been considered\r\ndistinctively foreign. We have another writ from the same king. The king\r\naddresses Archbishop Lyfing, Abbot Ælfmær, Æthelric the shireman 'and\r\nall my thegns twelvehinde and twihinde.' He tells them that he has\r\nconfirmed the archbishop's liberties and threatens with the pains of\r\nhell any one who infringes them[946]. We have a writ from Æthelred the\r\nUnready, and a remarkable writ it is. He addresses Ælfric the ealdorman,\r\nWulfmær and Æthelweard and all the thegns in Hampshire and tells them\r\nhow he has confirmed the liberties of bishop Ælfheah and how large\r\ntracts of land are to be reckoned as but one hide--an early example of\r\n'beneficial hidation[947].' Secondly, the solemn charter with its\r\ninvocation, its pious harangue, its dispositive words, its religious\r\nsanction, its numerous crosses, its crowd of attesting and consenting\r\nwitnesses, was in use in Normandy before and after the conquest of\r\nEngland. Thirdly, the Norman kings of England used it upon occasion.\r\nMuch they did by writ. The vast tracts of land that they had at their\r\ndisposal would naturally favour the conciser form; but some of the\r\nreligious houses thought it well to obtain genuine land-books of the old\r\nEnglish, and (we must add) of the old Frankish type. The king's seal was\r\nnot good enough for them; they would have the king's cross and the\r\ncrosses of his wife, sons, prelates and barons. The ultimately complete\r\nvictory of what we have called the writ-form over what we have called\r\nthe charter-form may perhaps be rightly described as a result of the\r\nConquest, an outcome, that is, of the strong monarchy founded by\r\nWilliam of Normandy and consolidated by Henry of Anjou, but it can not\r\nbe rightly described as the victory of a French form over an English\r\nform; and a very similar change was taking place in the chancery of the\r\nFrench kings[948].\r\n\r\n[Sake and soke appear when writs appear.]\r\n\r\nWe may say then that the appearance of words clearly and indisputably\r\nconceding jurisdictional rights is contemporaneous with the appearance\r\nof a new class of diplomata, namely royal writs as contrasted with royal\r\ncharters or land-books. We may add that it is contemporaneous with the\r\nappearance of royal diplomata couched in the vernacular language. This\r\nmay well lead us to two speculations. In the first place, is it not very\r\npossible that many ancient writs have been lost? The writ was a far less\r\nsolemn instrument than the land-book, and it is by no means certain that\r\nthe writs of the Confessor were intended to serve as title-deeds or to\r\ncome to the custody of those for whose benefit they were issued. King\r\nEdward greets the bishop of London, Earl Harold, the sheriff and all the\r\nthegns of Middlesex and tells them how he has given land to St. Peter\r\nand the monks of Westminster, and how he wills that they enjoy their\r\nsake and soke. The original document is presented to the bishop, the\r\nearl, or the sheriff (to all of them perhaps as they sit in their shire\r\nmoot) and we can not be certain that after this the monks ought to have\r\nthat document in their possession, that it ought not to be kept by the\r\nsheriff, or perhaps returned to the king with an indorsement expressive\r\nof obedience. Many hundred writs must King William have issued in favour\r\nof his barons--this is plain from Domesday Book--and what would we not\r\ngive for a dozen of them? Secondly, it is well worth notice that 'sake\r\nand soke' begin to appear so soon as royal diplomata written in English\r\nbecome common, and when we observe the formulas which enshrine these\r\nwords we find some difficulty in believing that such formulas are new or\r\nforeign. Let us listen to one.\r\n\r\n               saca and socne\r\n               toll and team\r\n               griðbrice and hamsocne\r\n               and foresteal\r\n               and alle oðre gerihte\r\n               inne tid and ut of tide\r\n               binnan burh and butan burh\r\n               on stræte and of stræte.\r\n\r\nSurely this alliteration and this rude rhythm tell us that the clause\r\nhas long been fashioning itself in the minds and mouths of the people\r\nand is no piece of a new-fangled 'chancery-style[949].' And one other\r\nremark about language will occur to us. In many respects the law Latin\r\nof the middle ages went on becoming a better and better language until,\r\nin the thirteenth century, it became a very good, useful and accurate\r\nform of speech. But it gained this excellence by frankly renouncing all\r\nattempts after classicality, all thought of the golden or the silver\r\nage, and by freely borrowing from English whatever words it wanted and\r\nmaking them Latin by a suffix. The Latin of the Anglo-Saxon land-books\r\nis for all practical purposes a far worse language, just because it\r\nstrives to be far better. It wanted to be good Latin, and even at times\r\ngood Greek. The scribe of the ninth or tenth century would have been\r\nshocked by such words as _tainus_, _dreinus_, _smalemannus_,\r\n_sochemannus_ which enabled his successors to say precisely what they\r\nwanted. He gives us _provincia_ instead of _scira_, _satrapes_ instead\r\nof _aldermanni_, and we read of _tributum_ and _census_ when we would\r\nmuch rather have read of _geldum_ and _gablum_. It was out of the\r\nquestion that he should be guilty of such barbarisms as _saca et soca_.\r\nIf he is to speak to us of these things, he will do so in some phrase\r\nwhich he thinks would not have disgraced a Roman orator--in a phrase,\r\nthat is, which will not really fit his thought.\r\n\r\n[Traditional evidence of sake and soke.]\r\n\r\nThe traditions, the legends, current in later times, can not be\r\naltogether neglected. The prelates of the thirteenth century often\r\nasserted that some of their franchises, and in particular their hundred\r\ncourts, had been given to their predecessors in an extremely remote age.\r\nThus the bishop of Salisbury claimed the hundred of Ramsbury in\r\nWiltshire by grant of King Offa of Mercia[950]; the Abbot of Ramsey\r\nclaimed the hundred of Clackclose in Norfolk by grant of King\r\nEdgar[951]. On such claims we can lay but very little stress, for if the\r\nchurch had held its 'liberties' from before the Conquest, the exact date\r\nat which it had acquired them was of little importance and their origin\r\nwould easily become the sport of guess-work and myth. But occasionally\r\nwe can say that there must in all probability be some truth in the tale.\r\nSuch is the case with the famous hundred of Oswaldslaw in\r\nWorcestershire. When the Domesday survey was made this hundred belonged\r\nto the church of Worcester. Worcestershire was deemed to comprise twelve\r\nhundreds and Oswaldslaw counted for three of them[952]. Oswaldslaw\r\ncontained 300 hides, and to all seeming the whole shire contained 1200\r\nhides or thereabouts. Even in the thirteenth century a certain\r\ntripleness seems to be displayed by this hundred; the bishop holds his\r\nhundred court in three different places, namely, outside the city of\r\nWorcester, at Dryhurst and at Wimborntree[953]. Now the story current in\r\nSt. Mary's convent was that this triple hundred of Oswaldslaw received\r\nits name from Oswald, the saintly bishop who ruled the church of\r\nWorcester from 960 to 992. A charter was produced, perhaps the most\r\ncelebrated of all land-books, that _Altitonantis Dei largiflua\r\nclementia_, which, after many centuries, was to prove the King of\r\nEngland's dominion over the narrow seas[954]. According to this charter\r\nEdgar, Oswald's patron, threw together three old hundreds, Cuthbertslaw,\r\nWolfhereslaw, and Wimborntree to form a domain for the bishop and his\r\nmonks[955]. Could we accept the would-be charter as genuine, could we\r\neven accept it as a true copy of a genuine book (and this we can hardly\r\ndo)[956], there would be an end of all controversy as to the existence\r\nof seignorial justice in the year 964, for undoubtedly it contains words\r\nwhich confer jurisdiction[957]. Upon these we will not rely: the fact\r\nremains that in Domesday Book there appears this hundred of Oswaldslaw,\r\nthat it is treated as a triple hundred, as three hundreds, that the\r\nbishop has jurisdiction over it, that the sheriff has no rights within\r\nit, that it looks like a very artificial aggregate of land, for pieces\r\nof it lie intermixed with other hundreds and pieces of it lie\r\nsurrounded by Gloucestershire. In 1086 the church of Worcester had to\r\nall appearance just those rights which the _Altitonantis_ professed to\r\ngrant to her; already they were associated with the name of Oswald;\r\nalready they were regarded as ancient privileges. 'Saint Mary of\r\nWorcester has a hundred called Oswaldslaw, in which lie 300 hides, from\r\nwhich the bishop of the said church, by a constitution of ancient times,\r\nhas the profits of all sokes and all the customs which belong thereto\r\nfor his own board and for the king's service and his own, so that no\r\nsheriff can make any claim for any plea or for any other cause:--this\r\nthe whole county witnesses[958].' Surely the whole county would not have\r\nspoken thus of some newfangled device of the half-Norman Edward. Such a\r\ncase as this, so great a matter as the utter exclusion of the sheriff\r\nfrom one quarter of the shire, we shall hardly attempt to explain by\r\nhypothetical usurpations. These liberties were granted by some king or\r\nother. If they were granted by the Confessor, why was not a charter of\r\nthe Confessor produced? Why instead was a charter of Edgar produced,\r\nperhaps rewritten and revised, perhaps concocted? The easiest answer to\r\nthis question seems to be that, whatever may be the truth about this\r\ndetail or that, the _Altitonantis_ tells a story that in the main is\r\ntrue. The diplomatist's scepticism should in this and other instances be\r\nheld in check by the reflexion that kings and sheriffs did not permit\r\nthemselves to be cheated wholesale out of valuable rights, when the true\r\nstate of the facts must have been patent to hundreds of men, patent to\r\nall the men of Oswaldslaw and to 'the whole county' of Worcester[959].\r\n\r\n[Criticism of the earlier books.]\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to the genuine books of an earlier time and patiently\r\nexamine their words. It is well known that an Anglo-Saxon land-book\r\nproceeding from the king very commonly, though not always, contains a\r\nclause of immunity. Sometimes a grant of immunity is the essence of the\r\nbook; the land in question already belongs to a church, and the bishop\r\nor abbot now succeeds in getting it set free from burdens to which it\r\nhas hitherto been subject. What is now granted to him is 'freedom,'\r\n'liberty,' 'freóls'; the book is a _freóls-bóc_[960]; it may be that he\r\nis willing to pay money, to give land, to promise prayers in return for\r\nthis franchise, this _libertas_[961]. Thus, for example, King Ceolwulf\r\nof Mercia grants a _libertas_ to the Bishop of Worcester, freeing all\r\nhis land from the burden of feeding the king's horses, and in\r\nconsideration of this grant the bishop gives to the king five hides of\r\nland for four lives and agrees that prayers shall be said for him every\r\nSunday[962].\r\n\r\n[The clause of immunity.]\r\n\r\nNow in an ordinary case the clause of immunity will first contain some\r\ngeneral words declaring the land to be free of burdens in general,\r\nand then some exceptive words declaring that it is not to be\r\nfree from certain specified burdens[963]. Both parts of the clause\r\ndemand our attention. The burdens from which the land is to be\r\nfree are described by a large phrase. Usually both a substantive\r\nand an adjective are employed for the purpose; they are to be freed\r\n_ab omni terrenae servitutis iugo_--_saecularibus negotiis_--_mundiali\r\nobstaculo_--_mundialibus causis_--_saecularibus curis_--_mundialibus\r\ncoangustiis_--_cunctis laboribus vitae mortalium_. The adjectives are\r\nremarkable, for they seem to suggest a contrast. The land is freed\r\nfrom all earthly, worldly, secular, temporal services. Does this\r\nnot mean that it is devoted to services that are heavenly, sacred,\r\nspiritual[964]? True, that in course of time we may find this same\r\nformula used when the king is giving land, not to a church, but to one\r\nof his thegns; but still in its origin the land-book is ecclesiastical;\r\n'book-right' is the right of the church, _ius ecclesiasticum_[965], and\r\nwe may well believe that the phraseology of the books, which in\r\nsubstance remains unaltered from century to century, was primarily\r\nadapted to pious gifts. It is by no means improbable that in the middle\r\nof the eighth century Æthelbald of Mercia by a general decree conceded\r\nto all the churches of his kingdom just that freedom from all burdens,\r\nsave the _trinoda necessitas_, that was usually granted by the clause of\r\nimmunity contained in the land-books, and we can hardly say with\r\ncertainty that half a century before this time Wihtræd had not granted\r\nto all the churches of Kent a yet larger measure of liberty, a liberty\r\nwhich absolved them even from the _trinoda necessitas_[966]. Turning\r\nfrom the adjectives to the substantives that are used, we find them to\r\nbe wide and indefinite words; the lands are to be free from all worldly\r\nservices, burdens, troubles, annoyances, affairs, business, causes,\r\nmatters and things. Sometimes a more definite word is added such as\r\n_tributum_, _vectigal_, _census_, and clearly one main object of the\r\nclause is to declare that the land is to pay nothing to the king or his\r\nofficers; it is to be free of rent and taxes, scotfree and\r\ngafolfree[967]. Occasionally particular mention is made of a duty of\r\nentertaining the king, his court, his officers, his huntsmen, dogs and\r\nhorses, also of a duty of entertaining his messengers and forwarding\r\nthem on their way[968]. Thus, for example, Taunton, which belonged to\r\nthe bishop of Winchester, had been bound to provide one night's\r\nentertainment for the king and nine nights' entertainment for his\r\nfalconers and to support eight dogs and a dog-ward, to carry with horses\r\nand carts to Curry and to Williton whatever the king might need, and to\r\nconduct wayfarers to the neighbouring royal vills. To obtain immunity\r\nfrom these burdens the bishop had to give the king sixty hides of\r\nland[969].\r\n\r\n[Discussion of the words of immunity.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is a sound canon of criticism that, when in a grant precise\r\nare followed by vague words, the former should be taken to explain, and,\r\nit may be, to restrain the latter. If, for example, land be freed 'from\r\ntaxes and all other secular burdens,' we may well urge that the 'other\r\nsecular burdens' which the writer has in his mind are burdens akin to\r\ntaxes. And of course it is fair to say that in our days a grant of\r\nprivate justice would be an extremely different thing from a grant of\r\nfreedom from fiscal dues. But what, we must ask, does this freedom from\r\nfiscal dues really mean when it is granted by an Anglo-Saxon land-book?\r\nWhen the monks or canons obtain a charter freeing this territory from\r\nall _tributum_ and _census_, from all _pastiones_ and so forth, is it\r\nintended that the occupiers of the soil shall have the benefit of this\r\ngrant? Not so. The religious have been stipulating for themselves and\r\nnot for their men. The land has been freed from service to the king in\r\norder that it may serve the church[970]; the church will take what the\r\nking has hitherto taken or it will take an equivalent. In a writ of\r\nEdward the Confessor this appears very plainly. Whenever men pay a geld\r\nto the king, be it an army-geld or a ship-geld, the men of St. Edmund\r\nare to pay a like geld to the abbot and the monks[971]. Probably this\r\nprinciple has been at work all along. The king has had no mind to free\r\nthe _manentes_, _casati_, _tributarii_ of the church from any _tributum_\r\nor _vectigal_. What has hitherto been paid to him, or some equivalent\r\nfor it, will now go to the treasury of the church. Thus, even within the\r\npurely fiscal region, we see that the object of the immunity is to give\r\nthe church a grip on those who dwell upon the land. But we must read the\r\nclause to its end.\r\n\r\n[The _trinoda necessitas_.]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, it usually proceeds to except certain burdens, to\r\ndeclare that the land is not to be free from them. These burdens, three\r\nin number, are on a few occasions spoken of as the _trinoda necessitas_.\r\nThat term has become common in our own day and is useful. The land is\r\nnot to be free from the duty of army-service, the duty of repairing\r\nstrongholds, the duty of repairing bridges. An express exception of this\r\n_trinoda necessitas_ out of the general words of immunity is extremely\r\ncommon. Moreover there are charters which speak as though no lands could\r\never be free from the triple charge[972], and a critic should look with\r\nsome suspicion upon any would-be land-book which expressly purports to\r\nbreak this broad rule. But besides some books which do expressly purport\r\nto free land from the _trinoda necessitas_[973], we have a considerable\r\nnumber of others which grant immunity in wide terms and make no\r\nexception of army-service, bridge-bote or burh-bote[974], and we are\r\nhardly entitled to reject them all merely because they do not conform to\r\nthe general principle[975]. More to our purpose is it to notice that,\r\nthough a grant of jurisdictional powers would be an extremely different\r\nthing from a grant of immunity from army-service, the duty of attending\r\nthe national or communal courts is extremely like the duty of attending\r\nthe host, and it would not be extravagant to argue that when the king\r\nsays 'I free this land from all secular burdens except those of\r\nfyrd-fare, burh-bote and bridge-bote,' he says by implication 'I free\r\nthis land from suit to shires and hundreds.'\r\n\r\n[The _ángild_.]\r\n\r\nBut yet more important is it to notice that charters of the ninth\r\ncentury frequently except out of the words of immunity not three\r\nburdens, but four. In addition to the _trinoda necessitas_, some fourth\r\nmatter is mentioned. Its nature is never very fully described, but it is\r\nhinted at by the terms _ángild_, _singulare pretium_, _pretium pro\r\npretio_. In connexion with these charters we must read others which\r\nexempt the land from 'penal causes,' or _wíte-rǽden_ and others which\r\nexpressly grant to the donee the 'wites' or certain 'wites' issuing from\r\nthe land; also we shall have to notice that there are dooms which decree\r\nthat certain 'wites' are to be paid to the land-lord or _land-ríca_. Now\r\n_ángild_ (_singulare pretium_) is a technical term in common use[976].\r\nWhen a crime has been committed--theft is the typical crime which the\r\nlegislators have ever before their eyes--the _ángild_ is the money\r\ncompensation that the person who has been wronged is entitled to\r\nreceive, as contrasted with any wite or fine that is payable to the\r\nking. We find, then, a charter saying that certain land--not certain\r\npersons, but certain land--is to be free from all secular burdens save\r\nthe _ángild_, and in some cases it will be added that the land is to pay\r\nnothing, not one farthing, by way of wite, or that nothing is 'to go out\r\nto wite[977].' Of the various interpretations that might possibly be put\r\nupon such words one may be at once rejected. It is not the intention of\r\nthe king who makes or of the church which receives the grant that crimes\r\ncommitted on this land shall go unpunished. No lord would wish his\r\nterritory to be a place where men might murder and steal with impunity.\r\nWe may be certain then that if a crime be committed, there is to be a\r\nwite; but it is not to go outside the land; the lord himself is to have\r\nit. But how is the lord to enforce his right to the wite,--must he sue\r\nfor it in the national or communal courts, or has he a court of his own?\r\n\r\n[The right to wites and the right to a court.]\r\n\r\nThis question is difficult. The ancient charters, however nearly they\r\nmay go to telling us that the donee will do justice within his\r\nterritory, never go quite that length. There is, however, a book granted\r\nby Cenwulf of Mercia in 816 to the church of Worcester which adds to the\r\nclause of immunity these words--'and if a wicked man be three times\r\ncaptured in open crime, let him be delivered up at the king's tún\r\n(_vicum regalem_)[978].' This seems to tell us that only the worst\r\noffenders will be delivered up to the royal or national officers and to\r\nimply that the bishop may do justice upon all others. Then there are two\r\nbooks in favour of the church of Abingdon, the one granted by Cenwulf in\r\n821, the other by Egbert in 835, which, though their language is very\r\nobscure, seem to tell us that if one of the 'men of God' (by which\r\nphrase are meant the 'vassals' of the church of Abingdon) be accused of\r\nany crime, the overseer of the church may swear away the charge by his\r\nown oath, and that, if he dare not swear, he may pay the _ángild_ to the\r\nplaintiff and, this done, will have justice over the offender[979].\r\nAnother ancient book suggests that the lord of an immunity, when he had\r\nto pay the _ángild_ for one of his men, could not be forced to cross the\r\nboundary of his land. On that boundary some mixed tribunal would meet\r\nconsisting partly of his men and partly of outsiders[980]. Then, again,\r\nthere are the books which either give the lord the _furis comprehensio_\r\nor else exempt his land from the _furis comprehensio_. Now when a writ\r\nof Cnut or Edward the Confessor tells us that a lord is to have\r\n_infangennethef_ we do not doubt that he is to have the right which bore\r\nthat name in later days, the right to hold a court for and to hang\r\nthieves who are caught in seisin of the stolen goods, and to the _furis\r\ncomprehensio_ of the older books we can hardly give another meaning. And\r\nthe apparent equivalence of the two phrases 'You shall hold this land\r\nwith thief-catching' and 'You shall hold this land free of\r\nthief-catching' illustrates our argument that to exempt land from public\r\nor national justice is to create private or seignorial justice[981]. We\r\nmay see this in later days; a lord who holds land 'free and quit of\r\nfrankpledge' assumes the right to hold a view of frankpledge, and we can\r\nnot say that he is wrong in so doing[982].\r\n\r\n[The Taunton book.]\r\n\r\nLastly, in a book of fairly good repute we may read of the grand\r\nliberties with which in 904 King Edward endowed the Bishop of\r\nWinchester's large estate at Taunton--that estate which in subsequent\r\ncenturies was to become the classical example of colossal manors. 'I\r\nhave,' says the king, 'granted to Christ that the men of the bishop,\r\nnoble as well as non-noble, living on the said land shall be worthy of\r\nthe same right that is enjoyed by those who dwell on the demesnes of the\r\ncrown, and that jurisdiction in all secular causes shall be exercised to\r\nthe use of the bishops in the same manner as that in which jurisdiction\r\nis exercised in matters pertaining to the king[983].' This is the more\r\nimportant because it suggests, what like enough is true, that the king\r\nhimself is one of the first of all 'immunists'; his own estates, the\r\nancient demesne of the crown, already stand outside the national system\r\nof finance, justice and police[984].\r\n\r\n[The immunist and the wite.]\r\n\r\nBut so careful must we be in drawing inferences from singular instances,\r\nso wary of forgeries, that in the end we can not dispense with arguments\r\nwhich rest rather upon probabilities than upon recorded facts. It is\r\nconceded that the 'immunist' (it is convenient to borrow a term that\r\nFrench writers have coined) is entitled to many of the fines and\r\nforfeitures that arise from offences committed within his territory. Is\r\nit, we must ask, probable that any ealdorman or sheriff will be at pains\r\nto exact and collect these fines and forfeitures for the immunist's\r\nbenefit? Now it is true that in later days a few lords enjoyed a\r\ncomparatively rare franchise known as _amerciamenta hominum_. When their\r\nmen were amerced in the king's court the amercements were paid into the\r\nexchequer, and then the lord would petition to have them paid out to\r\nhim[985]. But this was an uncommon and an exalted franchise. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the person in whose name a court is held, be he king or\r\nlord, gets the profits of the court. No one in the middle ages does\r\njustice for nothing, and in the ninth century the days when national\r\nofficers would be paid by salary were far distant. When the king\r\ndeclares that nothing is to 'go out' of the immunist's lands 'by way of\r\nwite,' then to our thinking he declares that, save in exceptional cases,\r\nhe and his officers will neither meddle nor make with offences that are\r\ncommitted within that territory. Again, though we may reject this\r\ncharter and that, there can be little doubt that before the end of the\r\ntenth century, the territory held by a church sometimes coincided with a\r\njurisdictional district, with a hundred or group of hundreds. When this\r\nwas so, and the church enjoyed a full immunity, it was almost of\r\nnecessity the lord of the court as well as the lord of the land. Why\r\nshould the sheriff hold that court, why should he appoint a bailiff for\r\nthat hundred, if never thereout could he get one penny for his own or\r\nthe king's use?\r\n\r\n[Justice and jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nWe must once more remember that even in the days of full grown feudalism\r\nthe right to hold a court was after all rather a fiscal than a\r\njurisdictional right. We call it jurisdictional, but still, at least\r\nnormally, the lord was, neither in his own person, nor yet in the person\r\nof his steward, the judge of the court[986]. His right was not in\r\nstrictness a right _ius dicendi_, for the suitors made the judgments.\r\nWhen analysed it was a right to preside over a court and to take its\r\nprofits. Very easy therefore is the transition from a right to 'wites'\r\nto such 'jurisdiction' as the feudal lord enjoys. When once it is\r\nestablished that all the fines of a hundred court are to go to a bishop,\r\nthat no sheriff or bailiff will get anything by going to hold that\r\ncourt, then the court already is 'in the bishop's hands.'\r\n\r\n[The Frankish immunity.]\r\n\r\nThis, however, can not be treated as a merely English question. Parallel\r\nto the English _fréols-bóc_ runs the Frankish _carta immunitatis_, and,\r\nif the former has given rise to the question whether it conceded\r\njurisdictional rights, the latter has given rise, not merely to the same\r\nquestion, but to much learned controversy. Now it is highly probable\r\nthat the English 'immunity' is not independent of the Merovingian\r\n'immunity'; still the terms of the former do not seem to have been\r\ncopied from those of the latter, and it is a significant fact that two\r\ndifferent formulas should be equally open to the blame of not deciding\r\njust that most important question which according to our ideas they\r\nought to decide. The Frankish formula is addressed by the king to his\r\nsubordinates and declares that no public officer (_nullus iudex\r\npublicus_) is to enter the land of the immunist for the purpose of\r\nhearing causes, levying _freda_ (which answer to our 'wites'), making\r\ndistresses or exacting pledges; but, like our English formula, it says\r\nno word of any court to be held or any jurisdiction to be exercised by\r\nthe immunist. It would be impertinent to give here any lengthy account\r\nof the various opinions about this matter that have been held by foreign\r\nscholars, still more impertinent to pronounce any judgment upon them,\r\nbut even those writers who seem most inclined to minimize the scope of\r\nthe immunity are forced to admit that, as a mere matter of fact, the\r\nimmunist by virtue of his immunity is enabled to hold a court for his\r\nterritory. That seignorial courts were growing up even in the\r\nMerovingian time, that such courts there were even in the sixth century,\r\nthere seems little or no doubt, even though it be denied that they were\r\nthe creatures of these clauses of immunity. On the whole, to whichever\r\nside of the channel we look, we seem compelled, alike by the words of\r\nthe charters and by the controversies which they have occasioned, to\r\nbelieve that in the eyes of the kings and the immunists seignorial\r\njurisdiction, that right to hold a court which seems to us so strange a\r\nright, was not a matter of the first importance, not worth conceding,\r\nnot worth denying. Who is to have the profits of justice?--that is a\r\nmomentous question. But if it be decided that they are to go to the\r\nbishop, then the king will have no further care for them:--the bishop\r\nmay and must get them for himself. As to the 'justiciables,' it may well\r\nbe that they are very indifferent about the matter, not impossible that\r\nthe burden of suit will be alleviated if the lord establishes a court of\r\nhis own, or if an old court passes into his hands[987].\r\n\r\n[Seignorial and ecclesiastical jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nOne other question should be raised, even if we can find for it no\r\ncertain answer. Is not seignorial jurisdiction very closely connected at\r\nits root with ecclesiastical jurisdiction? Of course in more recent\r\ntimes the two are thoroughly distinct from each other. The bishop,\r\nbesides being a spiritual judge, will be a feudal lord with many\r\nmanorial courts and many chartered franchises; but any court that he\r\nholds as a lord will have nothing to do with the court that he holds as\r\na bishop. The constitution and procedure of the one will differ at every\r\npoint from the constitution and procedure of the other. The one belongs\r\nto the temporal order and is subject to the king's court, the other\r\nbelongs to the spiritual order and is in no sense below the royal\r\ntribunal. Thus it is when feudal law and canon law have reached their\r\nfull stature. But even from the twelfth century we may get a hint that\r\nthe distinction has not always been so sharply marked. We may read how\r\nin Henry I.'s day the Bishop of Bath 'with his friends and barons' heard\r\na cause in which Modbert claimed lands that were held by the monks of\r\nBath. The proceedings took place under a royal writ and ought, we should\r\nsay, to have been in all respects temporal proceedings; but in framing\r\nthe judgment two bishops, three archdeacons and several 'clerks and\r\nchaplains' took the leading part, while the lay tenants of the bishop\r\nstood by as witnesses[988]. In this context we must remember that in the\r\ntwelfth century the clergy were contending that land given to a church\r\nin frankalmoin is outside the sphere of secular justice[989], and, while\r\nthis contention was being urged, it was easily possible that a bishop\r\nshould hold an amphibious court:--Over the claim that Modbert is making\r\nthe bishop has jurisdiction, either because the monks are holding the\r\nland of him as his tenants, or because that land has been given to God\r\nand the saints by an ancient book which denounced the anathema against\r\nall who should violate it. Going back yet further, we see, at all events\r\nin France, that the claim of the clergy to hold their lands and\r\nseignories exempt from all temporal jurisdiction has been intimately\r\nconnected with the claim of the clergy that they themselves need not\r\nanswer before a lay tribunal. A learned man has said that the exemption\r\nof the clergy from the temporal courts was 'the first step towards the\r\nfeudalization of justice[990].' If our English documents do not make\r\nthis plain, if the relations between church and state were more\r\nharmonious in England than elsewhere (and because more harmonious\r\ntherefore more indefinite and to the modern student more perplexing),\r\nstill we can see that the main idea of the English _fréols-bóc_ is the\r\nliberation of a tract of ground from all secular troubles, all temporal\r\nburdens, all earthly service. The land is dedicated to God and the\r\nsaints, or, if it is not dedicated in the strictest sense, it is given\r\nfor God's sake and the welfare of the donor's soul; it is within the ban\r\nof the church. And so the men who sit upon the land of the church of\r\nAbingdon, laymen though they be, are _homines Dei_, the men of God[991].\r\nAs such, should they not be subject to the jurisdiction of the church?\r\n\r\n[Criminal justice of the Church.]\r\n\r\nAt this point we may profitably remember that the jurisdiction which in\r\nlater days appears as the 'criminal jurisdiction' of ecclesiastical\r\ntribunals (the jurisdiction which, for example, those tribunals exercise\r\nwhen they chastise a man for incest, fornication or perjury) was but\r\nslowly disengaged from the general mass of penal jurisdiction that was\r\nwielded by moots in which the bishop occupied a prominent seat.\r\nMoreover, the bishop's justice did not escape that fiscal taint which\r\npervaded the whole system of criminal law. As in some cases the king is\r\nentitled to a _wite_, so in others the _wite_ falls to the bishop. For\r\ninstance, we see traces of a rude _concordat_, which, when incest or\r\nadultery is committed, subjects the woman to the bishop, the man to the\r\nking[992]; and then from Domesday Book we learn that in the borough of\r\nLewes the upshot of this partition is that the king will get 8_s._ 4_d._\r\nfrom the man while the adulteress pays a like sum to the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury[993]. And so ecclesiastical jurisdiction becomes a source of\r\nincome, a matter to be fought for and bargained for. The monks of Battle\r\nwill claim that within the _banlieu_ of their abbey all the 'forfeitures\r\nof Christianity' belong to them and not to the bishop of\r\nChichester[994]. What is more, they will connect their claim to purely\r\ntemporal justice with their possession of ordeal pits, and here we may\r\nsee another link between the hundred-moots and the churches[995]. The\r\nchurches have made money out of the ordeal. Long after the English\r\nprelates had been forbidden to hold spiritual pleas in the hundred\r\ncourts, Alexander III. was compelled to speak sharply to the archbishop\r\nof Canterbury touching the conduct of archdeacons who exacted thirty\r\npence from every man or woman who went to the fire or the water for\r\npurgation[996].\r\n\r\n[Antiquity of seignorial courts.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the theory to which we have been led implies that in the eighth\r\nor even in the seventh century, there were in England 'immunists' who\r\nhad jurisdiction within their territories, and further it implies that a\r\nroyal grant of land in the ninth and tenth centuries generally included,\r\nand this as a matter of 'common form,' a grant of jurisdiction. We\r\ncannot see either in the history of England or in the history of the\r\nFrankish Empire any reason why we should shrink from these conclusions.\r\nFurther, it must be admitted that if the clause of immunity conveys, or\r\npermits the growth of, seignorial jurisdiction, this jurisdiction is of\r\nan exalted kind, for no causes are excepted out of it, unless it be by\r\nthe words about the _ángild_, and even those words drop out from the\r\ncharters in course of time. Those words about the _ángild_ imply, to our\r\nthinking, that the immunist will have jurisdiction over any dispute\r\nwhich arises between two men of the enfranchised territory, and also\r\nthat if an action against one of these men be brought by a 'foreigner'\r\nin a court outside the precinct, the immunist can obtain 'cognizance' of\r\nthe action by appearing in that court and paying the _ángild_. When the\r\nwords about the _ángild_ disappear, this means that the immunist is\r\nobtaining a yet further measure of 'liberty':--whenever one of his men\r\nis sued he can 'crave his court' and need not, as a condition for\r\nobtaining it, offer to pay what is due to the plaintiff. The highest\r\ncriminal jurisdiction was probably excepted from the grant. Being a\r\ngrant of wites, it will not extend to the 'bootless' the 'unemendable'\r\ncrimes. But Cnut's attempt to save for himself certain pleas of the\r\ncrown looks to us like the effort of a strong king to recover what his\r\npredecessors have been losing[997]. And then Cnut himself and the\r\nConfessor,--the latter with reckless liberality--expressly grant to the\r\nchurches just those very reserved pleas of the crown. The result is\r\nthat the well endowed immunist of St. Edward's day has jurisdiction as\r\nhigh as that which any palatine earl of after ages enjoyed. No crime,\r\nexcept possibly some direct attack upon the king's person, property or\r\nretainers, was too high for him. It is the reconstruction of criminal\r\njustice in Henry II.'s time, the new learning of felonies, the\r\nintroduction of the novel and royal procedure of indictment, that reduce\r\nthe immunist's powers and leave him with nothing better than an\r\nunintelligible list of obsolete words[998]. In this matter of seignorial\r\njustice England had little to learn from Normandy. On the contrary, the\r\nNorman counts and barons were eager to secure the uncouth phrases which\r\ngave to the English immunist his justice, 'haute, moyenne et basse\r\njustice.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justice, vassalage and tenure.]\r\n\r\nOur next question must be whether in the days before the Conquest a\r\nfranchise or immunity was the only root of private jurisdiction: in\r\nother words, whether any jurisdiction was implied in the mere relation\r\nbetween lord and man or between lord and tenant. This also is a question\r\nwhich will hardly be finally answered if regard be had only to the\r\nEnglish documents. For France it is the question whether the _senior_,\r\nas such, has jurisdiction over his _vassus_, or again, whether he has\r\njurisdiction over his _vassus_ if, as is usually the case in the\r\nCarlovingian age, the _vassus_ holds a _beneficium_ given to him by his\r\n_senior_. The English dooms which deal with what we may call the\r\njusticiary relationship between lord and man closely resemble in many\r\nrespects the Frankish capitularies which touch the same subject; both\r\nsets of documents seem to evade the simple question that we put to them.\r\nBut as regards the continent it may here be enough to say that, though\r\nthere have been many debates, the current of learning seems to have set\r\ndecidedly in favour of the doctrine that neither in Merovingian nor yet\r\nin Carlovingian times had the _senior_, unless he was an immunist, a\r\njurisdiction over his men. Such a jurisdiction has not been developed\r\nwhen the midnight hides everything from our view. When the morning\r\ncomes, feudal justice stands revealed, though nowhere perhaps is it\r\ngoverned by that simple principle that ultimately prevailed in England,\r\nnamely, that any and every lord, no matter his personal rank or the rank\r\nof his tenement, has civil justice over his tenants.\r\n\r\n[The lord's duty when his man is accused.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of debate about this matter is afforded by texts of an\r\nearlier age, which at times seem to speak of the lord as 'doing justice'\r\nwhen a charge is brought against any of his men[999]. Our English run\r\nparallel with the Frankish texts. The state in its organization of\r\njustice and police does not treat the contract between man and lord,\r\nbetween _senior_ and _vassus_, as a matter of indifference, still less\r\nas a danger to society. We must not think of feudalism or vassalism as\r\nof something which from the very first is anti-national and anarchic. In\r\nits earliest stages it is fostered by the state, by the king, by\r\nnational law. The state demands that the lordless man of whom no right\r\ncan be had shall have a lord[1000]. It makes the lord responsible for\r\nthe appearance of his men in court to answer accusations[1001]. It is\r\nnot unlikely that the whole system of frankpledge grows out of this\r\nrequirement. In some instances the state may go further; it may treat\r\nthe lord, not merely as bound to produce his man, but as responsible for\r\nhis man's evil deeds. But, at all events, any one who has a charge to\r\nmake against a lord's man must in the first instance demand justice of\r\nthe lord. If without making such a demand, making it repeatedly, he\r\nbrings the charge before the king, he must pay the same fine that the\r\nlord would have paid had he been guilty of a default of justice[1002].\r\n'Of a default of justice' we say and are compelled to say. It is phrases\r\nsuch as this that have occasioned controversy. To an ear attuned to the\r\nlanguage of feudalism they seem to imply a seignorial court in which the\r\nlord 'does justice' or 'holds full right' to the demandant. But to all\r\nappearance they have gradually changed their meaning. Originally a lord\r\n'does right' to the demandant by producing in a public court the man\r\nagainst whom the claim is urged; or he does it by satisfying the claim,\r\nand in that case he seems entitled to exact from his man, not merely a\r\nsum which will compensate the outlay, but also the 'wite' or fine which\r\nin another case would have gone to the king or some national officer. He\r\nhas thus 'done justice' and may have the usual profit that comes of\r\ndoing justice. Probably we ought to distinguish between a laxer and a\r\nstricter measure of responsibility, between the lord's responsibility\r\nfor his men in general and his responsibility for such of his men as\r\nform his _familia_, in the language of later days his _mainpast_; but\r\nour texts do not lay much stress upon this distinction, and, as a matter\r\nof remote history, the relation between lord and man may grow out of the\r\nrelation between the head of a household and the members of it[1003].\r\n\r\n[Duty of the lord.]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, in numberless cases the law begins to interpose a third\r\nperson, namely, the wrong-doer's lord, between the wrong-doer and the\r\nwronged: it is to this lord that the claimant should in the first\r\ninstance address himself. The lord who does his duty by the king and the\r\nnation is he who keeps a tight hold on his men, who chooses them\r\ncarefully, who dismisses them if they are bad subjects, who 'does\r\njustice' and 'holds full right' if any of them be accused. Then, on the\r\nother hand, he has the right and duty of 'warranting' his men. If, as\r\nwill often happen, the bond between a lord and his man is complicated\r\nwith the bond between landlord and tenant, then, as in later days, if\r\nthe tenant's title be impeached, he will vouch his lord to warranty and\r\nthe lord will defend the action. But, besides this, within limits that\r\nare not well defined, the lord is the man's _defensor_ or _tutor_[1004].\r\nIt is expected of him by morality, if not by law, that he will take upon\r\nhimself the responsibility for his man's acts if they be not open\r\ncrimes. He must stand by his men and see them through all trouble[1005].\r\n\r\n[The state requires the lord to 'do right.']\r\n\r\nFor a while the state approves all this. The dangerous person is, not\r\nthe lord, whose wide lands are some security for his good behaviour, but\r\nthe lordless man of whom no right can be had. Somehow or another theft\r\nmust be suppressed. This is the determination of our strongest kings, of\r\nour wisest 'witan.' That they are raising up over against the state\r\nanother power, the power of seignorial justice, they do not see. And,\r\nafter all, these 'witan' both laymen and clerks are themselves great\r\nlords, and the king is the lordliest of them all. Thus the foundation\r\nfor a feudal jurisdiction is laid. Still between the lord's duty of\r\nproducing his men and his right to hold a court of and for his men there\r\nis to our eyes a great gulf. We have seen above that this gulf had not\r\nbeen bridged even in the Confessor's, even in the Conqueror's day[1006].\r\nNor to our thinking would it have been bridged but for the creation of\r\n'immunities' upon a grand scale. The first origin of the immunity we\r\nhave sought in the efforts of the clergy to obtain lands which should be\r\nutterly exempt from 'all earthly burdens,' 'all worldly business.' But\r\nthis effort unites with the stream of tendency that we have now been\r\nwatching. The state will be grateful to the church if it will 'hold all\r\nthe men of God to right' and do judgment between them and upon them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _land-ríca_ as immunist.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a long series of dooms going back as far as Æthelstan's\r\nreign which give certain fines and forfeitures to one who is described\r\nas the _land-hláford_ or the _land-ríca_. Remarkable they are, for they\r\nseem to assume that wherever a crime is committed there will be\r\nforthcoming some-one who will answer to the title 'the land-lord' or\r\n'the territorial magnate.' In some sense or another they presuppose that\r\nthere is _Nulle terre sans seigneur_. But who is this 'landlord'?\r\nAccording to our thinking, he is the lord of the hundred or else the\r\nlord who has a charter of immunity comprehending the land in question,\r\nand, if there be no person answering to this description, then he is the\r\nking. In the first place, in certain dooms relating to London we are\r\ntold that, when a thief is caught and slain, his property is to be\r\ndivided into two parts, of which his wife takes one, while the other is\r\ndivided between the king and 'the association' (perhaps we may say 'the\r\ngild') which was engaged in the pursuit and capture; 'but if it be\r\nbook-land or bishop's-land, the landlord takes half with the association\r\nin common[1007].' This seems to mean that there will be a lord to share\r\nin the proceeds of the forfeiture if, but only if, the scene of the\r\ncapture be land that is within an immunity. It is assumed, not without\r\nwarrant in the land-books, that the man who has book-land always, or\r\nalmost always, enjoys an immunity, while as to the bishop's-land,\r\nwhether the bishop be holding it in demesne or have granted it out to\r\nhis thegns, that no doubt will be protected by an ample charter. So\r\nagain, in another law 'the lord' receives the thief's _wer_ 'if he [the\r\nlord] is worthy of his wite[1008]': that is to say, the lord receives\r\nit if he is in enjoyment of an immunity which confers upon him a right\r\nto 'wites.' Then again, in several cases we find that the land-lord or\r\n_land-ríca_ shares the proceeds of a fine with the hundred or\r\nwapentake[1009]. This, as we think, points to the fact that the hundreds\r\nand wapentakes are passing into private hands. These laws are severe\r\nlaws against criminals. They urge all men to the pursuit of the flying\r\nthief and they hold out a reward to those who are active in this duty.\r\nThe men of the hundred are to have half the thief's property, while the\r\nlord (who in many cases will be the lord of the hundred) is to have the\r\nother half. He is to have no more, even though his charter may seem to\r\ngive him more. So again, in certain cases an accused person must find\r\nsecurity that he will stand a trial, and the gage is to be given 'half\r\nto the _land-ríca_, half to the wapentake[1010].' This _land-ríca_ is\r\nthe lord of the wapentake. In another instance the gage must be given\r\nhalf to the _land-ríca_ and half to the king's port-reeve[1011]. Then\r\nthere are cases in which the 'land-lord' is to take possession of cattle\r\nthat have been irregularly acquired and are presumably stolen, and is to\r\npreserve them until their true owner shall make his appearance[1012].\r\nThese provisions, which seem the foundation of the 'franchise of waif\r\nand stray,' suggest that the 'land-lord' is the president of the court\r\ninto which the owner must go when he wishes to prove his title; were\r\nthis not so, the king's reeve would be the person who would have the\r\ncustody of the unclaimed beasts. Certainly our explanation of these\r\npassages assumes that a hundred is often in private hands and it assumes\r\nthat, when this is not the case, then the king is regarded as the lord\r\nof the hundred. But in so doing it merely assumes that the state of\r\nthings revealed by Domesday Book is about a century old. When in that\r\nrecord we read that the soke of four and a half hundreds in Oxfordshire\r\n'belongs to' the royal manor of Bensington, that the soke of two\r\nhundreds 'belongs to' the royal manor of Headington, that the soke of\r\nother two hundreds 'belongs to' the royal manor of Bampton, we see that\r\nthe king is the lord, the proprietor, of those hundreds which have no\r\nother lord[1013]. From the laws now before us we infer that this is no\r\nvery new arrangement. But of course it is possible that those laws have\r\ndivers cases in view. It may be that within the hundred there is an\r\nimmunity, a privileged township or manor, and that a thief is caught\r\nthere. Who is to have the profits which arise from the crime and\r\ncondemnation? The answer is: Half shall go to the hundred, half to the\r\n_land-ríca_, that is to say, half goes to the doomsmen, or perhaps to\r\nthe lord, of the hundred court, half to the immunist. The lord under the\r\ngeneral words of his charter might perchance claim the whole; but, in\r\norder that all the hundredors may have an interest in the pursuit of\r\nthieves, it is otherwise decreed. But where is justice to be done, in\r\nthe hundred court or in the court of the immunist? That is a question of\r\nsecondary importance to which our laws do not address themselves. Very\r\nprobably justice will be done in the hundred court, or again it is not\r\nimpossible that a mixed tribunal consisting partly of the men of 'the\r\nfranchise,' partly of the men of 'the geldable' will meet upon the\r\nboundary of the immunist's land[1014]. Our main point must be that the\r\nland-lord or _land-ríca_ of these laws is an immunist, or is the king,\r\nwho, where there is no immunity, occupies the position of an immunist.\r\n\r\n[The immunist's rights over free men.]\r\n\r\nWe see too that the immunist's rights extend over free men and over free\r\nlandowners. If a man is guilty of heathenry he must, if he be a king's\r\nthegn, pay ten half-marks, half to Christ and half to the king, but if\r\nhe be another 'landowning man' then he pays six half-marks, half to\r\nChrist and half to the _land-ríca_[1015]. The landowner normally has a\r\nland-lord above him. We see also that the lord is made liable for the\r\npayment of dues which are ultimately exigible from those who are\r\ndwelling within his territory. 'If a king's thegn or other _land-ríca_\r\nmakes default in paying Peter's pence, he must pay ten half-marks, half\r\nto Christ and half to the king; if a \"towns-man\" makes a similar\r\ndefault, the _land-ríca_ must pay the penny and take an ox from the\r\ndefaulter, and if the _land-ríca_ neglects to do this, then Christ and\r\nthe king shall receive the full _bót_ of twelve ores[1016].' Such is the\r\nmanner in which the lord's power is consolidated. He begins to stand\r\nbetween his free men and the state, between his free men and the church.\r\n\r\n[Delegation of justiciary rights.]\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of the argument in which we have been engaged is\r\nthat, at least a century before the Conquest, the great immunists were\r\ngranting immunities to their dependants. From this consequence we shall\r\nnot flinch. Bishop Oswald, for example, was an immunist on a splendid\r\nscale, and when he loaned land to a knight and said that the land was to\r\nbe 'free from all secular service' save the _trinoda necessitas_, he\r\nloaned not merely land, but immunity and jurisdiction. On one occasion,\r\nadopting a formula that has lately come before us, he said that nothing\r\nwas to go out of the land by way of _wite_[1017]. By this we understand\r\nthat he gave to his thegn any wites which might thereafter be incurred\r\nby the inhabitants of the manses which were comprised in the loan, and\r\nfurther that he gave him the right to hold a court. Domesday Book\r\nrequires us to believe that such transactions had not been\r\nuncommon[1018].\r\n\r\n[Number of immunists.]\r\n\r\nWill our attempt to explain the land-books create too many holders of\r\nsake and soke? We do not think so, for we do not think that the number\r\nof land-books should be indefinitely multiplied by our imaginations. If\r\nwe look in Domesday Book at the counties which lie south of the Thames,\r\nwe shall indeed see that the total amount of land of which the churches\r\nare tenants in chief is very large. But the number of these landowning\r\nchurches is small. When we have named seven episcopal and a dozen\r\nabbatial minsters we have disposed of by far the greater bulk of the\r\nchurch lands in this district, and these minsters are as a general rule\r\njust those which have transmitted to us in cartularies and chronicles\r\nthe story of their acquisitions. To churches that were destroyed by the\r\nDanes we may allot some charters; but we should have no warrant for the\r\nsupposition that royal diplomata have perished by the hundred and left\r\nno trace behind. In the shires of York, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby we\r\nmight allow sake and soke to every English prelate who appears as a\r\ntenant in chief and yet not raise to twelve[1019] the number of the\r\necclesiastical immunists who had lands in this wide region. As to the\r\nlay holders of sake and soke, they were not very many though they held\r\nbroad lands; also they belonged for the more part to an exalted\r\nclass[1020]. However, here as elsewhere we must admit that every\r\nattempted explanation discloses new problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n_The Ángild Clause._\r\n\r\n     As we have said above, (p. 274), there are certain charters in\r\n     which the clause of immunity makes mention of the _ángild_\r\n     (_pretium pro pretio, singulare pretium_). We will here collect the\r\n     obscure texts in which this difficult term occurs.\r\n\r\n     First, however, we will call attention to a passage in Domesday's\r\n     account of Worcestershire (D. B. i. 175 b), which throws some light\r\n     on the matter. Westminster Abbey holds 200 hides and Pershore Abbey\r\n     holds 100 hides. 'The county says that the church of Pershore is\r\n     entitled to church-scot from all the 300 hides [its own 100 and\r\n     Westminster's 200], to wit, from every hide on which a free man\r\n     dwells one load of corn on St. Martin's day, (if he has more hides\r\n     than one, they are free), and if that day be infringed [i.e. if\r\n     payment be not made thereon], he who has kept back the corn must\r\n     pay elevenfold, but first must pay what is due [i.e. he altogether\r\n     pays twelve loads--\"God's property and the church's twelve-fold\"\r\n     (Æthelb. 1.)]; and the Abbot of Pershore will have a wite\r\n     (_forisfactura_) from his own 100 hides, such as he ought to have\r\n     from his own land; but from the other 200 hides he will have the\r\n     multifold payment of the corn that is due (_habet summam et\r\n     persolutionem_) and the Abbot of Westminster has the wite\r\n     (_forisfacturam_).' For _solvere et persolvere_, see Laws of\r\n     William (Select Charters) c. 5; for _solta et persolta_, see Dial.\r\n     de Scac. ii. 10.\r\n\r\n     If then, a Westminster tenant fails to pay church-scot to Pershore,\r\n     he must make _bót_ (very ample _bót_) to Pershore, but his _wite_\r\n     will go to his own lord; nothing is to 'go out to _wite_' from the\r\n     Westminster land. We will now turn to the land-books. We take them\r\n     to be saying in effect that in such a case as that put by Domesday\r\n     the grantee of the immunity is to have his man's wite, though the\r\n     restitutory _bót_ will go to another.\r\n\r\n     (i) A.D. 767. Uhtred of the Hwiccas. K. 117 (i. 144); B. i. 286:\r\n     'interdicimus ut si aliquis in hac praenominatam terram aliquid\r\n     foras furaverit alicui solvere aliquid nisi specialiter pretium pro\r\n     pretio ad terminum ad poenam nihil foras.' We should place a stop\r\n     after _terminum_. Then the last clause means 'nothing shall go out\r\n     to wite.' The mention of the _terminus_ suggests a payment at the\r\n     boundary of the immunist's land.\r\n\r\n     (ii) [Questionable]. A.D. 799. Cenwulf.

K. 236 (i. 312); B. i. 577; H. & S. iii. 613. The\r\n     same clause, but with _alienam_ instead of _aliam_. Also the\r\n     following:--'De illa autem tribulatione que witereden nominatur sit\r\n     libera nisi tamen singuli [_corr._ singulare?] pretium solverit ut\r\n     talia accipiant [accipiat?].'\r\n\r\n     This is very dark. Our best guess as to its meaning is this:--If a\r\n     man of God, that is, a tenant of the church, is accused of crime,\r\n     the _custos_ of the church (this may mean the abbot, but more\r\n     probably points to his reeve) may by his single oath purge the\r\n     accused. But if he dare not do this, then he (the abbot or reeve)\r\n     may pay the _bót_ that is claimed, and by performing this condition\r\n     he may obtain a transfer (_vicissitudo_) of the cause and do what\r\n     other justice remains to be done, i.e. he may exact the _wite_. So\r\n     in the second charter the abbot may pay the _bót_, the _singulare\r\n     pretium_, and so obtain a right to exact the wite:--he makes the\r\n     payment _ut talia_ [i.e. _witereden_] _accipiat_. In guessing that\r\n     _vicissitudo_ points to a transfer of a suit, we have in mind the\r\n     manner in which the Leges Henrici, 9 § 4, speak of the 'transition'\r\n     of causes from court to court. The case that is being dealt with by\r\n     these charters we take to be one in which an outsider in a\r\n     'foreign' court sues one of the abbot's tenants. The abbot can\r\n     swear away the charge, or if he dares not do this, can obtain\r\n     cognizance of the cause (in the language of a later day _potest\r\n     petere curiam suam_) and therewith the right to the _wite_, but\r\n     must in this case pay the restitutory _bót_, or rather, perhaps,\r\n     find security that this shall be paid to the plaintiff in case he\r\n     is successful. The clause may also imply that a multiple _bót_ can\r\n     not be exacted from the immunist's men, e.g. such a _bót_ as we saw\r\n     the Abbot of Pershore exacting from the Westminster men; but this\r\n     is a minor question.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [934] Adams, The Anglo-Saxon Courts of Law (Essays in Anglo-Saxon\r\n        Law, p. 1). Hallam, Middle Ages (ed. 1837), vol. ii. p. 416,\r\n        says that of the right of territorial jurisdiction 'we meet\r\n        frequent instances in the laws and records of the\r\n        Anglo-Saxons, though not in those of early date.' The one\r\n        charter older than Edward the Confessor that he cites is one\r\n        of the Croyland forgeries. Kemble's opinion seems to have\r\n        fluctuated; Saxons, i. 177 note, ii. 397, Cod. Dipl. i.\r\n        xliv-xlvii. K. Maurer, Krit. Ueberschau, ii. 57, thinks that\r\n        the existence of the private court is proved for Cnut's\r\n        reign, but not for any earlier time. Dr Stubbs, Const. Hist.\r\n        i. 119, seems to doubt whether it can be traced far beyond\r\n        the days of Cnut. Zinkeisen, Die Anfänge der\r\n        Lehngerichtsbarkeit in England (1893, a Berlin doctoral\r\n        dissertation), criticizes Mr Adams's theory.\r\n\r\n  [935] Essays, pp. 43-4.\r\n\r\n  [936] See above, p. 84.\r\n\r\n  [937] K. 853 (iv. 208); E. 343.\r\n\r\n  [938] The clearest instance is in the Waltham charter, K. 813 (iv.\r\n        154), but some details of this are not beyond suspicion. See\r\n        also the writs for Westminster, K. 828 (iv. 191), 857 (iv.\r\n        213); Ordn. Facs. vol. ii. pl. 9.\r\n\r\n  [939] Charter for St. Edmund's, K. 1346 (vi. 205).

Mr Adams (p.\r\n        44) stigmatizes this as an evident forgery; but the reasons\r\n        for this severe judgment are not apparent. See also K. 1321\r\n        (vi. 190), and the Latin writ of Harthacnut K. 1330 (vi. 192),\r\n        which may have a genuine basis.\r\n\r\n  [942] Cnut, II. 12 (Schmid, p. 276).\r\n\r\n  [943] Thus if a statute requires written and signed evidence of an\r\n        agreement, a letter in which the writer says, 'True, I made\r\n        such and such an agreement, but I am not going to keep it,'\r\n        may be evidence enough; see _Bailey_ v. _Sweeting_, 9 C.

The main formal difference is that\r\n        the charter professes to be witnessed by a number of the\r\n        king's councillors, while _Teste Meipso_ does for letters\r\n        patent.

A considerable number of specimens, genuine\r\n        and spurious (for our present purpose a forgery is almost as\r\n        valuable as a true charter), will be found in the Monasticon,\r\n        e.g. i. 174, Rufus for Rochester; i. 266, Rufus for Bath; ii.\r\n        109-111, 126, Henry I. for Abingdon; i. 163, Henry I. for\r\n        Rochester; ii. 65-6, Henry I. for Evesham; ii. 267, Henry I.\r\n        for Bath; ii. 539, Henry I. for Exeter; iii. 448, Henry I. for\r\n        Malvern; vi. (1) 247, Henry I. for Merton; iii. 406, Stephen\r\n        for Eye. Nor was this solemn form employed only by kings:--See\r\n        Monast. ii. 385-6, Earl Hugh for Chester; iii. 404, Robert\r\n        Malet for Eye; v. 121, Hugh de la Val for Pontefract; v. 167,\r\n        William of Mortain for Montacute; v. 190, Simon of Senlis for\r\n        St. Andrew Northampton; v. 247, Stephen of Boulogne for\r\n        Furness; v. 316, Richard Earl of Exeter for Quarr; v. 628,\r\n        Ranulf of Chester for Pulton. As to Normandy, see the charters\r\n        in the Neustria Pia and the Gallia Christiana. A charter of\r\n        Henry II. for Fontenay recites a charter by which the\r\n        ancestors of Jordan Tesson founded the abbey with the consent\r\n        of Duke William, also a charter of Duke William, 'quae cartae\r\n        crucibus sunt signatae secundum antiquam consuetudinem';\r\n        Neustria Pia, p. 80; Gallia Christiana, xi. Ap. col. 82. It is\r\n        probable that during the Norman reigns the king's cross was\r\n        considered more valuable even than the king's seal; Monast.\r\n        iv. p. 18, Henry I. says, 'hanc donationem confirmo ego\r\n        Henricus rex et astipulatione sanctae crucis et appositione\r\n        sigilli mei'; Ibid. ii. 385-6, Earl Hugh confirms a gift 'non\r\n        solum sigillo meo sed etiam sigillo Dei omnipotentis, id est,\r\n        signo sanctae crucis.' It is not implied in our text that\r\n        every specimen of each of the two forms of instrument that we\r\n        have mentioned will always display all the characteristics\r\n        that have been noticed. There is no reason, for example, why\r\n        in a solemn charter the king should not speak in the past\r\n        tense of the act of gift, and as a matter of fact he does so\r\n        in some of the Anglo-Saxon books, while, on the other hand, an\r\n        instrument which begins with a salutation may well have the\r\n        words of gift in the present tense (this is by no means\r\n        uncommon in Anglo-Norman documents); nor of course is it\r\n        necessary that an instrument in writ-form should be\r\n        authenticated by a seal instead of a cross. Again, a solemn\r\n        charter with crosses and pious recitals may begin with a\r\n        salutation. We merely point out that the diplomata of Edward\r\n        the Confessor and his Norman successors tend to conform to two\r\n        distinct types. As to this matter see the remarks of Hickes,\r\n        Dissertatio Epistolaris, p. 77; Hardy, Introduction to Charter\r\n        Rolls, xiv., xxxvi.\r\n\r\n  [949] The curious formula, Schmid, App. XI., already has 'ne sace ne\r\n        socne.' This seems to suppose that it is a common thing for a\r\n        man to have sake and soke over his land.\r\n\r\n  [950] R. H. ii. 231.\r\n\r\n  [951] R. H. ii. 458.\r\n\r\n  [952] D.

Appendix, 514 (vi.\r\n        237); Hickes, Dissertatio Epistolaris, i. 86; at the end of\r\n        his dissertation Hickes gives a facsimile of the instrument.\r\n\r\n  [955] A record of 825 (H. & S. iii. 596-601) mentions a place 'in\r\n        provincia Huicciorum' called Oslafeshlau; the editors of the\r\n        Councils say 'Oslafeshlau is probably the original name of the\r\n        hundred which now, either from some act of St. Oswald or by an\r\n        easy corruption, is called Oswaldslaw.' One of Oswald's books\r\n        (K. iii. 160) mentions 'Oswald's hlaw' among the boundaries of\r\n        Wulfringtune, i.e. Wolverton, a few miles east of Worcester.\r\n        It is very likely that the true name of the hundred is\r\n        Oswald's hlaw, i.e. Oswald's hill, not Oswald's law, though\r\n        the mistake was made at an early time. But the story told by\r\n        the charter as to the fusion of three old hundreds is\r\n        corroborated by Domesday, and in the thirteenth century one of\r\n        the three courts was still held at Wimborntree.\r\n\r\n  [956] But Dr Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. 118, relies on part of this\r\n        charter and it is not like ordinary forger's work. If, as is\r\n        highly probable, there has been some 'improvement' of the\r\n        charter, such improvement seems to have favoured, not the\r\n        church of Worcester as against the king, but the monks as\r\n        against the bishop.\r\n\r\n  [957] 'cum tolle et teame, saca et socne, et infangenetheof, et\r\n        proprii iuris debitum transgressionis, et poenam delicti quae\r\n        Anglice dicitur ofersæwnesse, et gyltwyte.'\r\n\r\n  [958] D. B. i. 172 b: 'Ecclesia S. Mariae de Wirecestre habet unum\r\n        hundret quod vocatur Oswaldeslau in quo iacent ccc. hidae. De\r\n        quibus episcopus ipsius ecclesiae a constitutione antiquorum\r\n        temporum habet omnes redditiones socharum et omnes\r\n        consuetudines inibi pertinentes ad dominicum victum et regis\r\n        servitium et suum, ita ut nullus vicecomes ullam ibi habere\r\n        possit querelam, nec in aliquo placito, nec in alia qualibet\r\n        causa. Hoc testatur totus comitatus.'\r\n\r\n  [959] Another example is Edgar's charter for Ely, A.D. 970 K. 563\r\n        (iii. 56), which bestows the soke over the two hundreds which\r\n        lie within the Isle, five hundreds in Essex, and all other\r\n        lands of the monastery. Kemble was inclined to accept the\r\n        A.-S. version of the charter. It purports to be obtained by\r\n        bishop Æthelwold and, if genuine, is closely connected with\r\n        the Oswaldslaw charter; both testify to unusual privileges\r\n        obtained by the founders of the new monasticism.\r\n\r\n  [960] E.g. K. 1298 (vi. 149), 'Dis is seo freolsboc to ðan mynstre\r\n        æt Byrtune.'\r\n\r\n  [961] E.g. K. 277 (ii. 58), 278 (ii. 60).\r\n\r\n  [962] A.D. 875; K. 306 (ii. 101); B. ii. 159.\r\n\r\n  [963] Unsuspected charters of the seventh and eighth centuries are\r\n        so few, that we hardly dare venture on any generalities about\r\n        their wording. But already in a charter attributed to 674, E.\r\n        p. 4, Brit. Mus. Facs. iv. 1, something very like the 'common\r\n        form' of later days appears; it appears also in a charter of\r\n        A.D. 691-2, K. 32 (i. 35), E. p. 12, of which we have but a\r\n        fragmentary copy, and before the end of the eighth century it\r\n        appears with some frequency; see e.g. Offa's charter of 774,\r\n        K. 123 (i. 150): 'sit autem terra illa libera ab omni\r\n        saecularis rei negotio, praeter pontis, arcisve restaurationem\r\n        et contra hostes communem expeditionem.'\r\n\r\n  [964] Occasionally the contrast is expressly drawn, e.g. by\r\n        Æthelbald, K. 90 (i. 108): 'ut ab omni tributo vectigalium\r\n        operum onerumque _saecularium_ sit libera ... tantum ut Deo\r\n        omnipotenti ex eodem agello _aecclesiasticae_ servitutis\r\n        famulatum inpendat.'\r\n\r\n  [965] See above, p. 229.\r\n\r\n  [966] Privilege of Wihtræd, A.D. 696-716, Haddan and Stubbs, iii.\r\n        238: 'Adhuc addimus maiorem libertatem. Inprimis Christi\r\n        ecclesiae cum omnibus agris ad eam pertinentibus, similiter\r\n        Hrofensi ecclesiae cum suis, caeterisque praedictis omnibus\r\n        ecclesiis Dei nostri, subiciantur pro salute animae meae,\r\n        meorumque praedecessorum, et pro spe caelestis regni ex hac\r\n        die, et deinceps concedimus et donamus ab omnibus\r\n        difficultatibus saecularium servitutis, a pastu Regis,\r\n        principum, comitum, nec non ab operibus, maioribus minoribusve\r\n        gravitatibus: et ab omni debitu vel pulsione regum tensuris\r\n        liberos eos esse perpetua libertate statuimus.' See also the\r\n        act by which Æthelbald confirmed this privilege in 742, H. &\r\n        S. iii. 340, B. i. 233-6. According to one version of this\r\n        act, the _trinoda necessitas_ is, according to another it is\r\n        not, excepted. The learned editors of the Councils speak of\r\n        'the suspicions common to every record that notices the\r\n        Privilege of Wihtræd.'

On the one hand, it has been contended\r\n        that there is no evidence older than 840 that he exercised\r\n        jurisdiction even as between the inhabitants of that\r\n        territory. On the other hand, it has been said that already in\r\n        614 he has civil jurisdiction in disputes between these\r\n        inhabitants, besides a criminal jurisdiction over them, which\r\n        however does not extend to the graver crimes. A few references\r\n        will suffice to put the reader in the current of this\r\n        discussion; Löning, Geschichte des Deutschen Kirchenrechts,\r\n        ii. 731; Brunner, D. R.

I). One of the most disputed points is the\r\n        character of the court held by an abbot, which is put before\r\n        us by the very ancient Formulae Andecavenses, a collection\r\n        attributed to the sixth or, at the latest, to the early years\r\n        of the seventh century. It has been asserted and denied that\r\n        this abbot of Angers is exercising the powers given to him by\r\n        an immunity; some have said that he, or rather his steward, is\r\n        merely acting as an arbitrator; Brunner, Forschungen, 665,\r\n        explains him as one of the _mediocres iudices_ of decaying\r\n        Roman law. On the whole, the balance of learning is inclining\r\n        to the opinion that, even in the Merovingian time, there were\r\n        great churches and other lords with courts which wielded power\r\n        over free men, and that the 'immunities,' even if they were\r\n        not intended to create such courts, at all events made them\r\n        possible, or, as Fustel says, consecrated them.\r\n\r\n  [988] Madox, Hist.

What the king gives he\r\napparently gives for good and all. In particular, a gift of land to a\r\nchurch is 'an out and out gift'; nay more, it is a dedication. Still,\r\neven within the sphere of piety and alms, we sometimes find the notion\r\nthat in consequence of the gift the donee should do something for the\r\ndonor. Cnut frees the lands of the church of Exeter from all burdens\r\nexcept military service, bridge-repair and 'assiduous prayers[1021],'\r\nand thus the title by which the churches hold their lands is already\r\nbeing brought under the rubric _Do ut des_. Turning to the books granted\r\nto laymen, we see that, at all events from the middle of the tenth\r\ncentury onwards, they usually state a _causa_, or as we might say 'a\r\nconsideration,' for the gift. Generally the gift is 'an out and out\r\ngift.' Words are used which expressly tell us that the donee is to enjoy\r\nthe land during his life and may on his death give it to whomsoever he\r\nchooses. Nothing is said about his paying rent or about his rendering in\r\nthe future any service to the king in return for the land. The\r\n'consideration' that is stated in the instrument is, if we may still use\r\nsuch modern terms, 'a past consideration.' The land comes rather as a\r\nreward than as a retaining fee. Sometimes indeed the thegn pays money to\r\nthe king and is in some sort a buyer of the land, though the king will\r\ntake credit for generosity and will talk of giving rather than of\r\nselling[1022]. More often the land comes as a reward to him for\r\nobedience and fidelity or fealty. Already the word _fidelitas_ is in\r\ncommon use; we have only to render it by _fealty_ and the transaction\r\nbetween the king and his thegn will be apt to look like an infeudation,\r\nespecially when the thegn is described by the foreign term\r\n_vassallus_[1023]. Even the general rule that the king is rewarding a\r\npast, rather than stipulating for a future fealty, is not unbroken. Thus\r\nas early as 801 we find Cenwulf of Mercia and Cuthræd of Kent giving\r\nland to a thegn as a perpetual inheritance 'but so that he shall remain\r\na faithful servant and unshaken friend to us and our magnates[1024].' So\r\nagain, in 946 King Edmund gives land to a faithful _minister_ 'in order\r\nthat while I live he may serve me faithful in mind and obedient in deed\r\nand that after my death he may with the same fealty obey whomsoever of\r\nmy friends I may choose[1025].' The king, it will be seen, reserves the\r\nright to dispose by will of his thegn's fealty. A continuing relation is\r\nestablished between the king and his successors in title on the one\r\nhand, the holder of the book-land and his successors in title on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Book-land and service.]\r\n\r\nHowever, as already said, the gift supposes that the personal\r\nrelationship of lord and thegn already exists between the donor and the\r\ndonee before the gift is made. This relationship was established by a\r\nformal ceremony; the thegn swore an oath of fealty, and it is likely\r\nthat he bent his knee and bowed his head before his lord[1026]. The\r\nNormans saw their homage in the English commendation[1027]. The fidelity\r\nexpected of the thegn is not regarded as a debt incurred by the receipt\r\nof land. And if the king does not usually stipulate for fidelity, still\r\nless does he stipulate for any definite service, in particular for any\r\ndefinite amount of military service. The land is not to be free of\r\nmilitary service:--this is all that is said. However, to say this is to\r\nsay that military service is already a burden on land. Already it is\r\nconceivable--very possibly it is true--that some of the lands of the\r\nchurches have been freed even from this burden[1028]. What is more, if\r\nwe may believe the Abingdon charters, the ninth century is not far\r\nadvanced before the king is occasionally making bargains as to the\r\namount of military service that the lands of the churches shall render.\r\nAbingdon need send to the host but twelve vassals and twelve\r\nshields[1029]. Likewise we see that on the eve of the Conquest, though\r\nother men who neglected the call to arms might escape with a fine of\r\nforty shillings, it was the rule, at least in Worcestershire, that the\r\nfree man who had sake and soke and could 'go with his land whither he\r\nwould' forfeited that land if he was guilty of a similar default[1030].\r\nWith this we must connect those laws of Cnut which say that the man who\r\nflees in battle, as well as the man who is outlawed, forfeits his\r\nbook-land to the king, no matter who may be his lord[1031].\r\n\r\n[Military service.]\r\n\r\nSuch rules when regarded from one point of view may well be called\r\nfeudal. Book-land having been derived from, is specially liable to\r\nreturn to the king. It will return to him if the holder of it be guilty\r\nof shirking his military duty or of other disgraceful crime. To this we\r\nmay add that if these rules betray the fact that the holder of this\r\nking-given land may none the less have commended himself and his land to\r\nsome other lord against whose claims the king has to legislate, thereby\r\nthey disclose a feudalism of the worst, of the centrifugal kind. The\r\nancient controversy as to whether 'the military tenures' were 'known to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons' is apt to become a battle over words. The old power of\r\ncalling out all able-bodied men for defensive warfare was never\r\nabandoned; but it was not abandoned by the Norman and Angevin kings. The\r\nholder of land was not spoken of as holding it by military service; but\r\nit would seem that in the eleventh century the king, save in some\r\npressing necessity, could only ask for one man's service from every five\r\nhides, and the holder of book-land forfeited that land if he disobeyed a\r\nlawful summons[1032]. Whether a man who will lose land for such a cause\r\nshall be said to hold it by military service is little better than a\r\nquestion about the meaning of words. At best it is a question about\r\nlegal logic. We are asked to make our choice (and yet may doubt whether\r\nour ancestors had made their choice) between the ideas of misdemeanour\r\nand punishment on the one hand and the idea of reentry for breach of\r\ncondition on the other.\r\n\r\n[Escheat of book-land.]\r\n\r\nThe same vagueness enshrouds the infancy of the escheat _propter\r\ndefectum tenentis_. Already in 825 a king tells how he gave land to one\r\nof his _praefecti_ who died intestate and without an heir, 'and so that\r\nland by the decree of my magnates was restored to me who had before\r\npossessed it[1033].' Here we seem to see the notion that when a gift has\r\nspent itself, when there is no longer any one who can bring himself\r\nwithin the words of donation, the given land should return to the giver.\r\nIn another quarter we may see that when the king makes a gift he does\r\nnot utterly abandon all interest in the land that is given. Cenwulf of\r\nMercia in a charter for Christ Church at Canterbury tells us that King\r\nEgbert gave land to a certain thegn of his who on leaving the country\r\ngave it to the minster; but that Offa annulled this gift and gave away\r\nthe land to other thegns, saying that it was unlawful for a thegn to\r\ngive away without his lord's witness (_testimonio_) the land given to\r\nhim by his lord[1034]. Cenwulf restored the land to the church; but he\r\ntook money for it, and he does not say that Offa had acted illegally.\r\nThere is much to show that the 'restraint on alienation' is one of the\r\noldest of the 'incidents of tenure.' Our materials do not enable us to\r\nformulate a general principle, but certain it is that the holders of\r\nbook-land, whether they be laymen or ecclesiastics, very generally\r\nobtain the consent of the king when they propose to alienate their land\r\neither _inter vivos_ or by testament. We may not argue from this to any\r\ndefinite condition annexed to the gift, or to any standing relationship\r\nbetween the donor and the donee like the 'tenure' of later times. After\r\nall, it is a very natural thought that a reward bestowed by the king\r\nshould not be sold or given away. The crosses and stars with which\r\nmodern potentates decorate their _fideles_, we do not expect to see\r\nthese in the market[1035]. The land that the king has booked to his\r\nthegn is an 'honour' and the giver will expect to be consulted before it\r\npasses into hands that may be unworthy of it. It may be just because the\r\ngift of book-land is made by the king and corroborated by all the powers\r\nof church and state, that the book is conceived as exercising a\r\ncontinuous sway over the land comprised in it. The book, it has well\r\nbeen said, is the _lex possessionis_ of that land[1036]. It can make the\r\nland descend this way or that way, and the land will come back to the\r\nking if ever the power of the book be spent. What is more, from the\r\nfirst we seem to see a germ of our famous English rule that if a gift be\r\nmade without 'words of inheritance' the gift will endure only during the\r\nlife of the donee:--will endure, we say, for a gift is no mere act done\r\nonce for all but a force that endures for a longer or a shorter period.\r\nCertain it is that most of the charters are careful to say that the gift\r\nis not thus to come to an end but is to go on operating despite the\r\ndonee's death[1037].\r\n\r\n[Alienation of book-land.]\r\n\r\nAnd even when, as is generally the case, the book made in favour of a\r\nlay-man says that the donee is to have the power of leaving the land to\r\nwhomsoever he may please, or to such heirs as he may choose, we still\r\nmust doubt whether his testamentary power is utterly unrestrained,\r\nwhether he will not have to consult the royal donor when he is making\r\nhis will. The phenomena which we have here to consider are very obscure,\r\nbecause we never can be quite certain why it is that a testator is\r\nseeking the king's aid. We have to remember that the testament is an\r\nexotic, ecclesiastical institution which is likely to come into\r\ncollision with the ancient folk-law. From an early time the church was\r\nstriving in favour of the utmost measure of testamentary freedom, for\r\nformless wills, for nuncupative wills[1038]. The very largeness of its\r\nclaims made impossible any definite compromise between church-right and\r\nfolk-right. So far as we can see, no precise law is evolved as to when\r\nand how and over what a man may exercise a power of testation. The\r\nchurch will support testaments of the most formless kind; on the other\r\nhand, the heirs of the dead man will endeavour, despite the anathema, to\r\nbreak his will, and sometimes they will succeed[1039]. Consequently the\r\ntestator will endeavour to obtain the crosses of the bishops and the\r\nconsent of the king. He has already a book which tells him that he may\r\nleave the land to a chosen heir; but if he be prudent he will not trust\r\nto this by itself. Kings change their minds.\r\n\r\n[The heriot and the testament.]\r\n\r\nThen the law about heriots complicates the matter. The heriot has its\r\norigin in the duty of the dying thegn or of his heirs to return to his\r\nlord the arms which that lord has given or lent to him. We have to use\r\nsome such vague phrase as 'given or lent'; we dare not speak more\r\nprecisely[1040]. A time comes when the king provides his thegn, no\r\nlonger with arms, but with land; still the heriot is rendered[1041]. In\r\nthe tenth century this render is closely connected with the exercise of\r\ntestamentary power. The thegn offers a heriot with a prayer that 'his\r\nwill may stand.' He presents swords and money to the king in order that\r\nhe may be worthy of his testament[1042]. When we find such phrases as\r\nthis, we can not always be certain that the land of which the testator\r\nis going to dispose is land over which a book purports to give him\r\ntestamentary power; he may be hoping that the king's aid will be\r\nsufficient to enable him to bequeath the unbooked land that he\r\nholds[1043]. In other cases he may be endeavouring to dispose of lands\r\nthat have merely been 'loaned' to him for his life by the king. But this\r\nwill hardly serve to explain all the cases, and we so frequently find\r\nthe holder of book-land applying for the king's consent when he is going\r\nto make an alienation of it _inter vivos_ that we need not marvel at\r\nfinding a similar application made when he is about to execute a\r\ntestament[1044].\r\n\r\n[The gift and the loan.]\r\n\r\nThis having been said, we shall not be surprised to find that in ancient\r\ntimes the difference between a gift of land and a loan of land was not\r\nnearly so well marked as it would be by modern law. The loan may be\r\nregarded as a temporary gift, the gift as a very permanent, if not\r\nperpetual, loan. We know how this matter looks in the law of Bracton's\r\nage. By feoffment one gives land to a man for his life, or one gives it\r\nto him and the heirs of his body, or to him and his heirs: but in any\r\ncase, the land may come back to the giver. The difference between the\r\nthree feoffments is a difference in degree rather than in kind; one will\r\noperate for a longer, another for a shorter time; but, however absolute\r\nthe gift may be, the giver never parts with all his interest in the\r\nland[1045]. Or we may put it in another way:--in our English law\r\nusufruct is a temporary _dominium_ and _dominium_ is a usufruct that may\r\nbe perpetual. Or, once more, adopting the language of modern statutes,\r\nwe may say that the tenant for life is no usufructuary but 'a limited\r\nowner.' We are accustomed to bring this doctrine into connexion with\r\nrules about dependent tenure:--the donor, we say, retains an interest in\r\nthe land because he is the tenant's lord. But, on looking at the ancient\r\nland-books, we may find reason to suspect that the confusion of loans\r\nwith gifts and gifts with loans (if we may speak of confusion where in\r\ntruth the things confounded have never as yet been clearly\r\ndistinguished) is one of the original germs of the rule that all land is\r\nheld of the king. After all, the king--and he is by far the greatest\r\ngiver in the country and his gifts are models for all gifts--never can\r\nreally part with all the rights that he has in the land that he gives,\r\nfor he still will be king of it and therefore in a sense it will always\r\nbe part of his land. To maintain a sharp distinction between the rights\r\nthat he has as king and the rights that he has as landlord,\r\njurisprudence is not as yet prepared.--But we must look at the land-loan\r\nmore closely.\r\n\r\n[The _precarium_.]\r\n\r\nForeign historians have shown how after the barbarian invasions one\r\nsingle form of legal thought, or (if we may borrow a term from them),\r\none single legal 'institute' which had been saved out of the ruins of\r\nRoman jurisprudence, was made to do the hard duty of expressing the most\r\nmiscellaneous facts, was made to meet a vast multitude of cases in\r\nwhich, while one man is the owner of land, another man is occupying and\r\nenjoying it by the owner's permission. This institute was the\r\n_precarium_. Originally but a tenancy at will, it was elaborated into\r\ndifferent shapes which, when their elaboration had been completed, had\r\nlittle in common. For some reason or another one begs (_rogare_) of a\r\nlandowner leave to occupy a piece of land; for some reason or another\r\nthe prayer is granted, the grantor making a display of generosity and\r\nspeaking of his act as a 'benefit' (_beneficium_), an act of good-nature\r\nand liberality. An elastic form is thus established. The petitioner may,\r\nor may not, promise to pay a rent to his benefactor; the benefactor may,\r\nor may not, engage that the relationship shall continue for a fixed term\r\nof years, or for the life of the petitioner or for several lives.\r\nUsually this relationship between petitioner and benefactor is\r\ncomplicated with the bond of patronage: the former has commended himself\r\nto the latter, has come within his power, his protection, his trust\r\n(_trustis_), has become his _fidelis_, his _homo_. At a later time the\r\ninferior is a _vassus_, the superior is his _senior_, for the word\r\n_vassus_, which has meant a menial servant, spreads upwards. Then the\r\n_precarium_, as it were, divides itself into various channels. One of\r\nits streams encompasses the large province of humble tenancies, wherein\r\nthe peasants obtain land from the churches and other owners on more or\r\nless arduous conditions, or reserve a right to occupy so long as they\r\nlive the lands that they have given to the saints. Another stream sweeps\r\nonward into the domain of grand history and public law. The noble\r\nobtains a spacious territory, perhaps a county, from the king by way of\r\n'benefaction'; the _precarium_ becomes the _beneficium_, the\r\n_beneficium_ becomes the _feudum_[1046]. The king can not prevent the\r\n_beneficia_, the _feuda_, from becoming hereditary.\r\n\r\n[The English land-loan.]\r\n\r\nThe analogous English institution was the _lǽn_ or, as we now say, loan.\r\nIf in translating a German book we render _Lehn_ by _fief_, _feud_, or\r\n_fee_, we should still remember that a _Lehn_ is a loan. And no doubt\r\nthe history of our ancient land-loans was influenced by the history of\r\nthe _precarium_. We come upon the technical terms of continental law\r\nwhen King Æthelbald forbids any one to beg for a benefit or benefice out\r\nof the lands that have been given to the church of Winchester[1047].\r\nThere was need for such prohibitions. Edward the Elder prayed the bishop\r\nof this very church to lend him some land for his life; the bishop\r\nconsented, but expressed a fervent hope that there would be no more of\r\nsuch requests, which in truth were very like commands. It would seem\r\nthat some of the English kings occasionally did what had been done on a\r\nlarge scale in France by Charles Martel or his sons, namely, they\r\ncompelled the churches to grant benefices to lay noblemen[1048]. When\r\nbishop Oswald of Worcester declared how he had been lending lands to his\r\nthegns, he used a foreign, technical term: '_beneficium_ quod illis\r\n_praestitum_ est[1049].' But it is clear that the English conception of\r\na land-loan was very lax; it would blend with the conception of a gift.\r\nTo describe transactions of one and the same kind, if such verbs as\r\n_commodare_ and _lǽnan_ and _lǽtan_ were used[1050], such words as\r\n_conferre_, _concedere_, _tribuere_, _largiri_ and _donare_ were also\r\nused[1051]. A loan is a temporary gift, and the nature of the\r\ntransaction remains the same whether the man to whom the loan is made\r\ndoes, or does not, come under the obligation of paying rent or\r\nperforming services.\r\n\r\n[Loans of church lands to the great.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately our materials only permit us to study one branch of the\r\nloan; the aristocratic branch we may call it. No doubt the lords,\r\nespecially the churches, are from an early time letting or 'loaning'\r\nlands to cultivators. Specimens of such agricultural leases we do not\r\nsee and cannot expect to see, for they would hardly be put into writing.\r\nBut at an early time we do see the churches loaning lands, and wide\r\nlands, to great men. This is a matter of much importance. One other\r\ncourse in the feudal edifice is thus constructed. We have seen the\r\nchurches interposed between the king and the cultivators of the soil;\r\nthe churches have become landlords with free land-holders under them.\r\nAnd now it is discovered that the churches have a superiority which they\r\ncan lend to others. We see already a four-storeyed structure. There are\r\nthe cultivator, the church's thegn, the church, the king. Very great men\r\nthink it no shame to beg boons from the church. Already before 750 the\r\nbishop of Worcester has granted five manses to 'Comes Leppa' for\r\nlives[1052]; before the century is out the abbot of Medeshamstead has\r\ngranted ten manses to the 'princeps' Cuthbert for lives[1053]. In 855\r\nthe bishop of Worcester gives eleven manses to the ealdorman of the\r\nMercians and his wife for their lives[1054]; in 904 a successor of his\r\nmakes a similar gift[1055]. But we have seen that the king himself was\r\nnot above taking a loan from the church. Indeed powerful men insist on\r\nhaving loans, and the churches, in order to protect themselves against\r\nimportunities, obtain from the king this among their other immunities,\r\nnamely, that no lay man is to beg boons from them, or that no lease is\r\nto be for longer than the lessee's life[1056]. In such cases we may\r\nalso see the working of a second motive: the church is to be protected\r\nagainst the prodigality of its own rulers. The leases made by the\r\nprelates seem usually to have been for three lives. This compass is so\r\noften reached, so seldom exceeded[1057] that we may well believe that\r\nthe English church had accepted as a rule of sound policy, if not as a\r\nrule of law, the novel of Justinian which set the limit of three lives\r\nto leases of church lands[1058].\r\n\r\n[The consideration for the loan.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the lease is made in consideration of a sum of money paid\r\ndown; occasionally the recipient of the land comes under an express\r\nobligation to pay rent. An early example shows us the abbot of\r\nMedeshamstead letting ten manses to the 'princeps' Cuthbert for lives in\r\nconsideration of a gross sum of a thousand shillings and an annual\r\n_pastus_ or 'farm' of one night[1059]. The bishop of Worcester early in\r\nthe ninth century concedes land to a woman for her life on condition\r\nthat she shall cleanse and renovate the furniture of the church[1060].\r\nOn the other hand, when land is 'loaned' to a king or a great nobleman,\r\nthis may be in consideration of his patronage and protection; the church\r\nstipulates for his _amicitia_[1061]. We may say that he becomes the\r\n_advocatus_ of the church, and the patronage exercised by kings and\r\nnobles over the churches is of importance, though perhaps it was not\r\nquite so serious a matter in England as it was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[St. Oswald's loans.]\r\n\r\nBut from our present point of view by far the most interesting form that\r\nthe loan takes is the loan to the thegn or the _cniht_. Happily it falls\r\nout that we have an excellent opportunity of studying this institution.\r\nWe recall the fact that by the gifts of kings and underkings the church\r\nof Worcester had become entitled to vast tracts of land in\r\nWorcestershire and the adjoining counties. Now between the years 962 and\r\n992 Bishop Oswald granted at the very least some seventy loans\r\ncomprising in all 180 manses or thereabouts[1062]. In almost all cases\r\nthe loan was for three lives. In a few cases the recipient was a kinsman\r\nof the bishop, in a few he was an ecclesiastic; far more generally he is\r\ndescribed as 'minister meus,' 'fidelis meus,' 'cliens meus,' 'miles\r\nmeus,' 'my knight,' 'my thegn,' 'my true man.' When the 'cause' or\r\nconsideration for the transaction is expressed it is 'ob eius fidele\r\nobsequium' or 'pro eius humili subiectione atque famulatu': a recompense\r\nis made for fealty and service. Any thing that could be called a\r\nstipulation for future service is very rare. A definite rent is seldom\r\nreserved[1063]. Sometimes the bishop declares that the land is to be\r\nfree from all earthly burdens, save service in the host and the repair\r\nof bridges and strongholds. To those excepted imposts he sometimes adds\r\nchurch-scot, or the church's rent, without specifying the amount.\r\nSometimes he seems to go further and to say that the land is to be free\r\nfrom everything save the church's rent (_ecclesiasticus census_)[1064].\r\nIn so doing he gives a hint that the recipients of the lands will have\r\nsomething to pay to, or something to do for the church. Were it not for\r\nthis, we might well think that these loans were made solely in\r\nconsideration of past services, of obedience already rendered, and that\r\nat most the recipient undertook the vague obligation of being faithful\r\nand obsequious in the future.\r\n\r\n[St. Oswald's letter to Edgar.]\r\n\r\nBut happily for us St. Oswald was a careful man of business and put on\r\nrecord in the most solemn manner the terms on which he made his\r\nland-loans. The document in which he did this is for our purposes the\r\nmost important of all the documents that have come down to us from the\r\nage before the Conquest[1065]. It takes the form of a letter written to\r\nKing Edgar. We will give a brief and bald abstract of it[1066]:--'I am\r\n(says the bishop) deeply grateful to you my lord, for all your\r\nliberality and will remain faithful to you for ever. In particular am I\r\ngrateful to you for receiving my complaint and that of God's holy Church\r\nand granting redress by the counsel of your wise men[1067]. Therefore I\r\nhave resolved to put on record the manner in which I have been granting\r\nto my faithful men for the space of three lives the lands committed to\r\nmy charge, so that by the leave and witness of you, my lord and king, I\r\nmay declare this matter to the bishops my successors, and that they may\r\nknow what to exact from these men according to the covenant that they\r\nhave made with me and according to their solemn promise. I have written\r\nthis document in order that none of them may hereafter endeavour to\r\nabjure the service of the church. This then is the covenant made with\r\nthe leave of my lord the king and attested, roborated and confirmed by\r\nhim and all his wise men. I have granted the land to be held under me\r\n(_sub me_) on these terms, to wit, that every one of these men shall\r\nfulfil the whole law of riding as riding men should[1068], and that they\r\nshall pay in full all those dues which of right belong to the church,\r\nthat is to say _ciricsceott_, _toll_, and _tace_ or _swinscead_, and all\r\nother dues of the church (unless the bishop will excuse them from any\r\nthing), and shall swear that so long as they possess the said land they\r\nwill be humbly subject to the commands of the bishop. What is more, they\r\nshall hold themselves ready to supply all the needs of the bishop; they\r\nshall lend their horses; they shall ride themselves, and be ready to\r\nbuild bridges and do all that is necessary in burning lime for the work\r\nof the church[1069]; they shall erect a hedge for the bishop's hunt and\r\nshall lend their own hunting spears whenever the bishop may need them.\r\nAnd further, to meet many other wants of the bishop, whether for the\r\nfulfilment of the service due to him or of that due to the king, they\r\nshall with all humility and subjection be obedient to his domination and\r\nto his will[1070], in consideration of the benefice that has been loaned\r\nto them, and according to the quantity of the land that each of them\r\npossesses. And when the term for which the lands are granted has run\r\nout, it shall be in the bishop's power either to retain those lands for\r\nhimself or to loan them out to any one for a further term, but so that\r\nthe said services due to the church shall be fully rendered. And in case\r\nany shall make wilful default in rendering the aforesaid dues of the\r\nchurch, he shall make amends according to the bishop's _wite_[1071] or\r\nelse shall lose the gift and land that he enjoyed. And if any one\r\nattempt to defraud the church of land or service, be he deprived of\r\nGod's blessing unless he shall make full restitution. He who keeps this,\r\nlet him be blessed; he who violates this, let him be cursed: Amen. Once\r\nmore, my lord, I express my gratitude to you. There are three copies of\r\nthis document; one at Worcester, one deposited with the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and one with the Bishop of Winchester.'\r\n\r\n[Feudalism in Oswaldslaw.]\r\n\r\nNow we may well say that here is feudal tenure. In the first place, we\r\nnotice a few verbal points. The recipient of the _lǽn_ has received a\r\n_beneficium_ from the bishop, and if he will not hold the land _de\r\nepiscopo_, none the less he will hold it _sub episcopo_. Then he is the\r\nbishop's _fidelis_, his _fidus homo_, his 'hold and true man,' his\r\nthegn, his knight, his soldier, his _minister_, his _miles_, his\r\n_eques_. Then he takes an oath to the bishop, and seemingly this oath\r\nstates in the most energetic terms his utter subjection to the bishop's\r\ncommands. What is more, he swears to be faithful and obedient because he\r\nhas received a _beneficium_ from the bishop, and the amount of his\r\nservice is measured by the quantity of land that he has received. Then\r\nagain, we see that he holds his land by service; if he fails in his\r\nservice, at all events if he denies his liability to serve, he is in\r\nperil of losing the land, though perhaps he may escape by paying a\r\npecuniary fine. As to the services to be rendered, if we compare them\r\nwith those of which Glanvill and Bracton speak, they will seem both\r\nmiscellaneous and indefinite; perhaps we ought to say that they are all\r\nthe more feudal on that account. The tenant is to pay the church-scot,\r\nthe _ecclesiasticus census_ of other documents. This, as we learn from\r\nDomesday Book, is one load (_summa_) of the best corn from every hide of\r\nland, and unless it be paid on St. Martin's day, it must be paid\r\ntwelve-fold along with a fine[1072]. He must pay toll to the bishop when\r\nhe buys and sells; he must pay _tace_, apparently the pannage of a later\r\ntime, for his pigs. He must go on the bishop's errands, provide him with\r\nhunting-spears, erect his 'deer-hedge' when he goes to the chase. There\r\nremains a margin of unspecified services; for he must do what he is told\r\nto do according to the will of the bishop. But, above all, he is a\r\nhorseman, a riding man and must fulfil 'the law of riding.' For a moment\r\nwe are tempted to say 'the law of chivalry.' This indeed would be an\r\nanachronism; but still he is bound to ride at the bishop's command. Will\r\nhe ride only on peaceful errands? We doubt it. He is bound to do all\r\nthe service that is due to the king, all the forinsec service[1073] we\r\nmay say. A certain quantity of military service is due from the bishop's\r\nlands; his thegns must do it. As already said, the obligation of serving\r\nin warfare is not yet so precisely connected with the tenure of certain\r\nparcels of land as it will be in the days of Henry II., but already the\r\nnotion prevails that the land owes soldiers to the king, and probably\r\nthe bishop has so arranged matters that his territory will be fully\r\n'acquitted' if his _equites_, his _milites_ take the field. Under what\r\nbanner will they fight? Hardly under the sheriff's banner. Oswald is\r\nfounding Oswaldslaw and within Oswaldslaw the sheriff will have no\r\npower. More probably they will follow the banner of St. Mary of\r\nWorcester. This we know, that in the Confessor's reign one Eadric was\r\nsteersman of the bishop's ship and commander of the bishop's\r\ntroops[1074]. This also we know, that in the suit between the churches\r\nof Worcester and of Evesham that came before the Domesday commissioners,\r\none of the rights claimed by the bishop against the abbot was that the\r\nmen of two villages, Hamton and Bengeworth, were bound to pay geld and\r\nto fight along with the bishop's men[1075]. And then, suppose that Danes\r\nor Welshmen or Englishmen make a raid on the bishop's land, is it\r\ncertain that he will communicate with the ealdorman or the king before\r\nhe calls upon his knights to defend and to avenge him? Still we must not\r\nbring into undue relief the military side of the tenure.\r\n\r\n[Oswald's riding men.]\r\n\r\nThese men may be bound to fight at the bishop's call, but fighting is\r\nnot their main business; they are not professional warriors. They are\r\nthe predecessors not of the military tenants of the twelfth century, but\r\nof the _radchenistres_, and _radmanni_ of Domesday Book, the\r\n_rodknights_ of Bracton's text, the thegns and drengs of the northern\r\ncounties who puzzle the lawyers of the Angevin time. Point by point we\r\ncan compare the tenure of these _ministri_ and _equites_ of the tenth\r\nwith that of the thegns and drengs of the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies and at point after point we find similarity, almost identity.\r\nThey pay rent; they have horses and their horses are at the service of\r\ntheir lord; they must ride his errands, carry his stores, assist him in\r\nthe chase; they must fight if need be, but the exact nature of this\r\nobligation is indefinite[1076]. Dependent tenure is here and, we may\r\nsay, feudal tenure, and even tenure by knight's service, for though the\r\nEnglish _cniht_ of the tenth century differs much from the knight of the\r\ntwelfth, still it is a change in military tactics rather than a change\r\nin legal ideas that is required to convert the one into the other. As\r\nevents fell out there was a breach of continuity; the English thegns and\r\ndrengs and knights either had to make way for Norman _milites_, or, as\r\nsometimes happened, they were subjected to Norman _milites_ and\r\nconstituted a class for which no place could readily be found in the new\r\njurisprudence of tenures. But had Harold won the day at Hastings and at\r\nthe same time learnt a lesson from the imminence of defeat, some\r\npeaceful process would probably have done the same work that was done by\r\nforfeitures and violent displacements. The day for heavy cavalry and\r\nprofessional militancy was fast approaching when Oswald subjected his\r\ntenants to the _lex equitandi_.\r\n\r\n[Heritable loans.]\r\n\r\nYet another of those feudal phenomena that come before us in the twelfth\r\ncentury may easily be engendered by these loans; we mean the precarious\r\ninheritance, the right to 'relieve' from the lord the land that a dead\r\nman held of him[1077]. In speaking of Oswald's loans as 'leases for\r\nthree lives' we have used a loose phrase which might lead a modern\r\nreader astray. Oswald does not let land to a man for the lives of three\r\npersons named in the lease and therefore existing at the time when the\r\nlease is made; rather he lets the land to a man and declares that it\r\nshall descend to two successive heirs of his. The exact extent of the\r\npower that the lessee has of instituting an heir, in other words of\r\ndevising the land by testament, instead of allowing it to be inherited\r\n_ab intestato_, we need not discuss; suffice it that the lessee's rights\r\nmay twice pass from ancestor to heir, or from testator to devisee[1078].\r\nNow such a lease may cover the better part of a century. A time will\r\ncome when the land ought to return to the church that gave it; but for\r\nsome eighty years it will have 'been in one family' and twice over it\r\nwill have been inherited. Is it very probable that the bishop will be\r\nable to oust the third heir? Will he wish to do so, if three generations\r\nof thegns or knights have faithfully served the church? May we not be\r\nfairly certain that this third heir will get the land on the old terms,\r\nif he will 'recognize' the church's right to turn him out? As a matter\r\nof fact we see that Oswald's successors have great difficulty in\r\nrecovering the land that he has let[1079]. In the middle ages he who\r\nallows land to descend twice has often enough allowed it to become\r\nheritable for good and all. Despite solemn charters and awful anathemas\r\nhe will have to be content with a relief[1080].\r\n\r\n[Wardship and marriage.]\r\n\r\nBut at least, it will be said, there was no 'right of wardship and\r\nmarriage.' We can see the beginning of it. In 983 Oswald let five manses\r\nto his kinsman Gardulf. Gardulf is to enjoy the land during his life;\r\nafter his death his widow is to have it, if she remains a widow or if\r\nshe marries one of the bishop's subjects[1081]. So the bishop is already\r\ntaking an interest in the marriages of his tenants; he will have no\r\nwoman holding his land who is married to one who is not his man. And\r\nthen Domesday Book tells us how in the Confessor's day one of Oswald's\r\nsuccessors had disposed of an heiress and her land to one of his\r\nknights[1082].\r\n\r\n[Seignorial jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\nStill, it will be urged, the feudalism here displayed is imperfect in\r\none important respect. These tenants of the church of Worcester hold\r\ntheir land under contracts cognizable by the national courts; they do\r\nnot hold by any special feudal law, they are not subject to any feudal\r\ntribunal. Now if when we hear of 'feudalism,' we are to think of that\r\norderly, centralized body of land-law which in Henry III.'s day has\r\nsubjected the whole realm to its simple but mighty formulas, the\r\nfeudalism of Oswald's land-loans is imperfect enough. But then we must\r\nremind ourselves that never in this country does feudal law (the\r\n_Lehnrecht_ of Germany) become a system to be contrasted with the\r\nordinary land law (_Landrecht_)[1083], and also we must observe that\r\nalready in Oswald's day the thegns of the church of Worcester were in\r\nall probability as completely subject to a private and seignorial\r\njustice as ever were any freeholding Englishman. What court protected\r\ntheir tenure, what court would decide a dispute between them and the\r\nbishop? Doubtless--it will be answered--the hundred court. But in all\r\nprobability that court, the court of the great triple hundred of\r\nOswaldslaw was already in the hand of the bishop who gave it its\r\nname[1084]. The suits of these tenants would come into a court where the\r\nbishop would preside by himself or his deputy, and where the doomsmen\r\nwould be the tenants and justiciables of the bishop--not indeed because\r\ntenure begets jurisdiction (to such a generalization as this men have\r\nnot yet come)--but still, the justice that these tenants will get will\r\nbe seignorial justice.\r\n\r\n[Oswaldslaw and England at large.]\r\n\r\nNow how far we should be safe in drawing from Oswald's loans and\r\nOswaldslaw any general inferences about the whole of England is a\r\ndifficult question. It is clear that the bishop was at great pains to\r\nregulate the temporal affairs of his church. He obtained for his leases\r\nthe sanction of every authority human and divine, the consent of the\r\nconvent, the ealdorman, the king, the witan; he deposited the covenant\r\nwith the king, with the archbishop of Canterbury, with the bishop of\r\nWinchester. Also we must remember that he had lived in a Frankish\r\nmonastery, and that, at least in things monastic, he was a radical\r\nreformer. Nor should it be concealed that in Domesday Book the entries\r\nconcerning the estates of the church of Worcester stand out in bold\r\nrelief from the monotonous background. Not only is the account of the\r\nhundred of Oswaldslaw prefaced by a statement which in forcible words\r\nlays stress on its complete subjection to the bishop, but in numerous\r\ncases the tenure of the nobler and freer tenants within that hundred is\r\ndescribed as being more or less precarious:--they do whatever services\r\nthe bishop may require; they serve 'at the will of the bishop'; no one\r\nof them may have any lord but the bishop; they are but tenants for a\r\ntime and when that time is expired their land will revert to the\r\nchurch[1085].\r\n\r\n[Inferences from Oswald's loans.]\r\n\r\nHowever, we should hesitate long before we said that Oswald's land-loans\r\nwere merely foreign innovations. His predecessors had granted leases for\r\nlives; other churches were granting leases for lives, and the important\r\ndocument that he sent to the king proves to us that we can not trust our\r\nAnglo-Saxon lease or land-book to contain the whole of the terms of that\r\ntenure which it created. Suppose that this unique document had perished,\r\nhow utterly mistaken an opinion should we have formed of the terms upon\r\nwhich the thegns and knights of the church of Worcester held their\r\nlands! We should have heard hardly a word of money payments, no word of\r\nthe oath of subjection, of the _lex equitandi_, of the indefinite\r\nobligation of obeying whatever commands the bishop might give. It may\r\nwell be that the thegns and knights of other churches held on terms very\r\nsimilar to those that the bishop of Worcester imposed. Even if we think\r\nthat Oswald was an innovator, we must remember that the adviser of\r\nEdgar, the friend of Dunstan, the reformer of the monasteries, the man\r\nwho for thirty years was Bishop of Worcester and for twenty years\r\nArchbishop of York, was able to make innovations on a grand scale. What\r\nsuch a man does others will do. The yet safer truth that what Oswald did\r\ncould be done, should not be meaningless for us. In the second half of\r\nthe tenth century there were men willing to take land on such terms as\r\nOswald has described.\r\n\r\n[Economic position of Oswald's tenants.]\r\n\r\nThese men were not peasants. The land that Oswald gave them they were\r\nnot going to cultivate merely by their own labour and the labour of\r\ntheir sons and their slaves, though we are far from saying that they\r\nscorned to handle the plough. We have in Domesday Book a description of\r\ntheir holdings, and it is clear that in the Confessor's day, when some\r\nof Oswald's leases must yet have been in operation, the lessees had what\r\nwe should describe as small manors with villeins and cottagers upon\r\nthem. Thus, for example, Eadric the Steersman, who led the bishop's\r\nhost, had an estate of five hides which in 1086 had three _villani_ and\r\nfour _bordarii_, to say nothing of a priest, upon it[1086]. Like enough,\r\nwhat the bishop has been 'loaning' to his thegns has been by no means\r\nalways 'land in demesne,' it has been 'land in service': in other words,\r\na superiority, a seignory. Thus, as we say, another course of the feudal\r\nedifice is constructed. Above the cultivator stands the thegn or the\r\n_cniht_, who himself is a tenant under the bishop and who owes to the\r\nbishop services that are neither very light nor very definite. We can\r\nnot but raise the question whether the cultivators, if we suppose them\r\nto be in origin free landowners, can support the weight of this\r\nsuperstructure without being depressed towards serfage. But we are not\r\nyet in a position to deal thoroughly with this question[1087].\r\n\r\n[Loan-land and book-land.]\r\n\r\nWe must now return for a moment to the relation that exists between the\r\nloan and the book. _Lǽnland_ is contrasted with _bócland_; but\r\nhistorians have had the greatest difficulty in discovering the principle\r\nthat lies beneath this distinction[1088]. Certainly we can not say that,\r\nwhile book-land is created and governed by a charter, there will be no\r\nwritten instrument, no book, creating and governing the _lǽn_. We have\r\nbooks which in unambiguous terms tell us that they bear witness to\r\nloans. Nor can we say that the holder of book-land will always have a\r\nperpetual right to the land, 'an estate in fee simple,' an estate to him\r\nand his heirs. In many cases a royal charter will create a smaller\r\nestate than this; it will limit the descent of the land to the heirs\r\nmale of the donee. Moreover the written leases for three lives of which\r\nwe have been speaking are 'books.' Thus in 977 Oswald grants three\r\nmanses to his thegn Eadric for three lives, and the charter ends with a\r\nstatement which tells us in English that Oswald the archbishop is\r\nbooking to Eadric his thegn three hides of land which Eadric formerly\r\nheld as _lǽnland_[1089]. A similar deed of 985 contains a similar\r\nstatement; five hides which Eadric held as _lǽnland_ are now being\r\nbooked to him, but booked only for three lives[1090]. In yet another of\r\nOswald's charters we are told that the donee is to hold the land by way\r\nof book-land as amply as he before held it by way of _lǽnland_[1091].\r\nAfter this it is needless to say that book-land may be burdened with\r\nrents and services. But indeed it would seem that Oswald's thegns and\r\nknights held both book-land and _lǽnland_. It was book-land because it\r\nhad been booked to them, and yet very certainly it had only been loaned\r\nto them[1092].\r\n\r\n[Book-land in the dooms.]\r\n\r\nLet us then turn to the laws and read what they say about book-land. Two\r\nrules stand out clearly. Æthelred the Unready declares that every _wíte_\r\nincurred by a holder of book-land is to be paid to the king[1093]. Cnut\r\ndeclares that the book-land of the outlaw, whosesoever man he may be,\r\nand of the man who flies in battle is to go to the king[1094]. These\r\nlaws seem to put before us the holder of book-land as standing by reason\r\nof his land in some specially close relationship to the king. If we may\r\nuse the language of a later day, the holder of book-land is a tenant in\r\nchief of the king, and this even though he may have commended himself to\r\nsomeone else. On the other hand, if the holder of _lǽnland_ commits a\r\ngrave crime, his land reverts, or escheats or is forfeited to the man\r\nwho made the _lǽn_[1095]. And yet, though this be so and though Oswald's\r\nthegns will in some sense or another be holding book-land, we may be\r\nquite certain that should one of them be outlawed the bishop will claim\r\nthe land. Indeed he is careful about this as about other matters. Often\r\nhe inserts in his charter a clause saying that, whatever the grantee may\r\ndo, the land shall return unforfeited to the church.\r\n\r\n[Relation of loan-land to book-land.]\r\n\r\nAny solution of these difficulties must be of a somewhat speculative\r\nkind. We fashion for ourselves a history of the book and of the\r\nland-loan which runs as follows:--The written charter first makes its\r\nappearance as a foreign and ecclesiastical novelty. For a very long time\r\nit is used mainly, if not solely, as a means of endowing the churches\r\nwith lands and superiorities. It is an instrument of a very solemn\r\ncharacter armed with the anathema and sanctioned by the crosses of those\r\nwho can bind and loose. Usually it confers rights which none but kings\r\ncan bestow, and which even kings ought hardly to bestow save with the\r\nadvice of their councillors. A mass of rights held under such a charter\r\nis book-land, or, if we please, the land over which such rights are\r\nexercisable, is book-land for the grantee. In course of time similar\r\nprivileges are granted by the kings to their thegns, though the book\r\ndoes not thereby altogether lose its religious traits. It is long before\r\nprivate persons begin to use writing for the conveyance or creation of\r\nrights in land. The total number of the books executed by persons who\r\nare neither kings, nor underkings, nor prelates of the church, was, we\r\ntake it, never very large; certainly the number of such books that have\r\ncome down to us is very small.\r\n\r\n[Royal and other books.]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more utterly unproved than the opinion that in\r\nAnglo-Saxon times written instruments were commonly used for the\r\ntransfer of rights in land. Let us glance for a moment at the documents\r\nthat purport to have come to us from the tenth century. Genuine and\r\nspurious we have near six hundred. But we exclude first the grants made\r\nby the kings, secondly Oswald's leases and a few similar documents\r\nexecuted by other prelates, thirdly a few testamentary or\r\nquasi-testamentary dispositions made by the great and wealthy. Hardly\r\nten documents remain. Let us observe their nature. The ealdorman and\r\nlady of the Mercians make a grant to a church in royal fashion[1096];\r\nbut in every other case in which we have a document which we can\r\nconceive as either transferring rights in land or as being formal\r\nevidence of such a transfer, the consent of the king or of the king and\r\nwitan to the transaction is stated, and with hardly an exception the\r\nking executes the document[1097]. Even the holder of book-land who\r\nwished to alienate it, for example, the thegn who wished to pass on his\r\nbook-land to a church, did not in general execute a written conveyance.\r\nOne of three courses was followed. The donor handed over his own book,\r\nthe book granted by the king, and apparently this was enough; or the\r\nparties to the transaction went before the king, delivered up the old\r\nand obtained a new book; or the donor executed some brief\r\ninstrument--sometimes a mere note endorsed on the original book--stating\r\nhow he had transferred his right[1098]. But in any case, according to\r\nthe common usage of words, a usage which has a long history behind it,\r\nit is only the man who is holding under a royal privilege who has\r\n'book-land.' It is to this established usage that the laws refer when\r\nthey declare that the king and no lower lord is to have the _wíte_ from\r\nthe holder of book-land, and that when book-land is forfeited it is\r\nforfeited to the king. For all this, however, if you adhere to the\r\nletter, book-land can only mean land held by book. Now from a remote\r\ntime men have been 'loaning' land, and prelates when they have made a\r\nloan have sometimes executed a written instrument, a book. A prelate can\r\npronounce the anathema and the recipient of the _lǽn_ may well wish to\r\nbe protected, not merely by writing, but by Christ's rood. When\r\ntherefore Bishop Oswald grants a written lease to one of his thegns who\r\nheretofore has been in enjoyment of the land but has had no charter to\r\nshow for it, we may well say that in the future this thegn will have\r\nbook-land, though at the same time he has but loan-land. We have no\r\nscruple about charging our ancestors with having a confused terminology.\r\nThe confusion is due to a natural development; 'books' were formerly\r\nused only for one purpose, they are beginning to be used for many\r\npurposes, and consequently 'book-land' may mean one thing in one\r\ncontext, another in another. We may say that every one who holds under a\r\nwritten document holds book-land, or we may still confine the name\r\n'book' to that class of books which was at one time the only class. The\r\nking's charters, the king's privileges, have been the only books; they\r\nare still books in a preeminent sense. Just so in later days men will\r\nspeak of 'tenure in capite' when what they really mean is 'tenure in\r\ncapite of the crown by military service[1099].'\r\n\r\n[The gift and the loan.]\r\n\r\nBut there is a deeper cause of perplexity. Once more we must repeat that\r\nthe gift shades off into the loan, the loan into the gift. The loan is a\r\ngift for a time. It is by words of donation ('I give,' 'I grant') that\r\nOswald's _beneficia_ are _praestita_ to his knights and thegns.\r\nConversely, the king's most absolute gift leaves something owing and\r\ncontinuously owing to him; it may be prayers, it may be fealty and\r\nobedience. And having considered by how rarely good fortune it is that\r\nwe know the terms of Oswald's land-loans, how thoroughly we might have\r\nmistaken their nature but for the preservation of a single document, we\r\nshall be very cautious in denying that between many of the holders of\r\nbook-land and the king there was in the latter half of the tenth century\r\na relationship for which we have no other name than feudal tenure. If\r\nOswald's charters create such a tenure, what shall we say of the\r\nnumerous charters whereby Edred, Edwy, Edgar and Æthelred grant land to\r\ntheir thegns in consideration of fealty and obedience? Must not these\r\nthegns fulfil the whole _lex equitandi_; will they not lose their lands\r\nif they fail in this service? True that the rights conferred upon them\r\nare not restrained within the compass of three lives but are heritable\r\n_ad infinitum_. But does this affect the character of their tenure? Can\r\nwe--we can not in more recent times--draw any inference from 'the\r\n_quantum_ of the estate' to 'the quality of the tenure'? On the whole,\r\nwe are inclined to believe that the practice of loaning lands affected\r\nthe practice of giving lands, there being no sharp and formal\r\ndistinction between the gift and the loan, and that when Edward the\r\nConfessor died no great injustice would have been done by a statement\r\nthat those who held their lands by royal books held their lands 'of' the\r\nking. This at least we know, that the formula of dependent tenure ('_A_\r\nholds land of _B_') was current in the English speech of the Confessor's\r\ndays and that some of the king's thegns held their land 'of' the\r\nking[1100]. We may guess that those old terms 'book-land' and\r\n'loan-land' would soon have disappeared even from an unconquered\r\nEngland, for it was becoming plain that the book bears witness to a\r\nloan. A new word was wanted; that word was _feudum_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1021] K. 729 (iv. 3).\r\n\r\n  [1022] It is noticeable that the verb _syllan_ usually means 'to\r\n         give.'

K. 279 (ii. 61):\r\n         lease by the same church to a dux and his wife with\r\n         stipulation for _amicitia_.\r\n\r\n  [1062] These are preserved in Heming's Cartulary; see K. 494-673.\r\n\r\n  [1063] In K. 498 (ii. 386) the _aecclesiasticus census_ is two\r\n         _modii_ of clean grain; in K. 511 (ii. 400) the lessee must\r\n         mow once and reap once 'with all his craft'; in K. 508 (ii.\r\n         398) he must sow two acres with his own seed and reap it; in\r\n         K. 661 (iii. 233) is a similar stipulation.\r\n\r\n  [1064] In many cases the clause of immunity has become very obscure\r\n         owing to a copyist's blunder. It is made to run thus: 'Sit\r\n         autem terra ista libera omni regi nisi aecclesiastici censi.'\r\n         Some mistake between _rei_ and _regi_ may be suspected. What\r\n         we want is what we get in some other cases, e.g. K. 651, 652,\r\n         viz. 'libera ab omni saecularis rei negotio.' The following\r\n         forms are somewhat exceptional; K. 530 and 612, 'butan\r\n         ferdfare and walgeworc and brycgeworc _and circanlade'_; K.\r\n         623, 666, 'excepta sanctae dei basilicae suppeditatione et\r\n         ministratione'; K. 625, 'exceptis sanctae dei aecclesiae\r\n         necessitatibus et utilitatibus.'\r\n\r\n  [1065] Kemble gives it in Cod. Dipl. 1287 (vi. 124) and in an\r\n         appendix to vol. i. of his history. Also he speaks of it in\r\n         Cod. Dipl. i. xxxv., and there says that it is 'a laboured\r\n         justification' by Bp Oswald of his proceedings. To my mind it\r\n         is nothing of the kind. Oswald is proud of what he has done\r\n         and wishes that a memorial of his acts may be carefully\r\n         preserved for the benefit of the church. Of course, if\r\n         regarded from our modern point of view, the form of the\r\n         document is curious. The bishop seems engaged in an attempt\r\n         to bind his lessees by his own unilateral account of the\r\n         terms to which they have agreed. But his object is to have of\r\n         the contract a record which has been laid before the king and\r\n         the witan and which, if we are to use modern terms, will have\r\n         all the force of an act of parliament, to say nothing of the\r\n         anathema.\r\n\r\n  [1066] In places its language becomes turbid and well-nigh\r\n         untranslatable.\r\n\r\n  [1067] It may be that the bishop has just obtained from the king a\r\n         grant or confirmation of the hundredal jurisdiction over what\r\n         is to be Oswaldslaw.\r\n\r\n  [1068] K. vi. 125: 'hoc est ut omnis equitandi lex ab eis impleatur\r\n         quae ad equites pertinet.'\r\n\r\n  [1069] K. vi. 125: 'et ad totum piramiticum opus aecclesiae calcis\r\n         atque ad pontis aedificium ultro inveniantur parati.' The\r\n         translation here given is but guesswork; we suppose that\r\n         _piramiticus_ means 'of or belonging to fire (πῦρ).'\r\n\r\n  [1070] Ibid.: 'insuper ad multas alias indigentiae causas quibus\r\n         opus est domino antistiti frunisci, sive ad suum servitium\r\n         sive ad regale explendum, semper illius archiductoris\r\n         dominatui et voluntati qui episcopatui praesidet ... subditi\r\n         fiant.' Is _archiductor_ but a fine name for the bishop? We\r\n         think not. In the Confessor's day Eadric the Steersman was\r\n         'ductor exercitus episcopi ad servitium regis' (Heming, i.\r\n         81), and it would seem from this that the tenants were to be\r\n         subject to a captain set over them by the bishop. But in the\r\n         famous, if spurious, charter for Oswaldslaw (see above, p.\r\n         268) Edgar says that on a naval expedition the bishop's men\r\n         are not to serve under the ordinary officers 'sed cum suo\r\n         archiductore, videlicet episcopo, qui eos defendere et\r\n         protegere debet ab omni perturbatione et inquietudine.' This\r\n         would settle the question, could we be certain that the words\r\n         'videlicet episcopo' were not the gloss of a forger who was\r\n         improving an ancient instrument. For our present purpose,\r\n         however, it is no very important question whether the\r\n         _archiductor_, the commander in chief of these tenants, is\r\n         the bishop himself or an officer of his.\r\n\r\n  [1071] Ibid.: 'praevaricationis delictum secundum quod praesulis ius\r\n         est emendet.'\r\n\r\n  [1072] D.

See also the story told by Heming on p.\r\n         264.\r\n\r\n  [1080] Lamprecht, op. cit. p. 61, says that it was quite uncommon\r\n         for the French landlord to get back his land if once he let\r\n         it for three lives. One of the Worcester leases, but one\r\n         stigmatized by Kemble (ii. 152), is a lease for three lives\r\n         'nisi haeredes illius tempus prolixius a pontifice sedis\r\n         illius adipisci poterint.'\r\n\r\n  [1081] K. 637 (iii. 194): 'si in viduitate manere decreverit, vel\r\n         magis nubere voluerit, ei tamen viro qui episcopali dignitati\r\n         supradictae aecclesiae sit subiectus.'\r\n\r\n  [1082] D.

At best it may be a late Latin translation of\r\n         an English original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _The Growth of Seignorial Power._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Subjection of free men.]\r\n\r\nWe now return to our original theme, the subjection to seignorial power\r\nof free land-holders and their land, for we now have at our command the\r\nlegal machinery, which, when set in motion by economic and social\r\nforces, is capable of effecting that subjection. Let us suppose a\r\nvillage full of free land-holders. The king makes over to a church all\r\nthe rights that he has in that village, reserving only the _trinoda\r\nnecessitas_ and perhaps some pleas of the crown. The church now has a\r\nsuperiority over the village, over the ceorls; it has a right to receive\r\nall that, but for the king's charter, would have gone to him.\r\n\r\n[The royal grantee and his land.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it has a right to the _feorm_, the _pastus_ or\r\n_victus_ that the king has hitherto exacted. We should be wrong in\r\nthinking that in the ninth century (whatever may have been the case in\r\nearlier times) this exaction was a small matter. In 883 Æthelred\r\nealdorman of the Mercians with the consent of King Alfred freed the\r\nlands of Berkeley minster from such parts of the king's _gafol_ or\r\n_feorm_ as had until then been unredeemed. In return for this he\r\nreceived twelve hides of land and thirty mancuses of gold, and then in\r\nconsideration of another sixty mancuses of gold he proceeded to grant a\r\nlease of these twelve hides for three lives[1101]. The king had been\r\nderiving a revenue from this land 'in clear ale, in beer, in honey, in\r\ncattle, in swine and in sheep.' In Domesday Book a 'one night's farm'\r\nis no trifle; it is all that the king gets from large stretches of his\r\ndemesne[1102]. Having become entitled to this royal right, the church\r\nwould proceed to make some new settlement with the villagers. Perhaps it\r\nwould stipulate for a one night's farm for the monks, that is to say,\r\nfor a provender-rent capable of supporting the convent for a day. In the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century a day's farm of the monks of Canterbury\r\ncomprised forty sesters of ale, sixty loaves, a wether, two cheeses and\r\nfour fowls, besides other things[1103]. When once a village is charged\r\nin favour of a lord with a provender-rent of this kind, the lord's grip\r\nupon the land may easily be tightened. A settlement in terms of bread\r\nand beer is not likely to be stable. Some change in circumstances will\r\nmake it inconvenient to all parties and the stronger bargainer will make\r\nthe best of the new bargain. The church will be a strong bargainer for\r\nit has an inexhaustible treasure-house upon which to draw. We, however,\r\nconcerned with legal ideas, have merely to notice that the law will give\r\nfree play to social, economic and religious forces which are likely to\r\nwork in the lord's favour.\r\n\r\n[Provender rents and the manorial economy.]\r\n\r\nBut a village charged with a 'provender-rent' may seem far enough\r\nremoved from the typical manor of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\r\nIn the one we see the villagers cultivating each for his own behoof and\r\nsupplying the lord at stated seasons with a certain quantity of\r\nvictuals; in the other the villagers spend a great portion of their time\r\nin tilling the lord's demesne land. In the latter case the lord himself\r\nappears as an agriculturist: in the former he is no agriculturist, but\r\nmerely a receiver of rent. The gulf may seem wide; but it is not\r\nimpassable. One part, the last part, of a process which surmounts it is\r\nvisible. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the lords, though they\r\nhave much land in demesne, still reckon the whole or part of what they\r\nare to receive from each manor in terms of 'farms'; the king gets a one\r\nnight's farm from this manor, the convent of Ramsey gets a fortnight's\r\nfarm from that manor[1104]. But we can conceive how the change begins.\r\nThe monks are not going to travel, as a king may have travelled, from\r\nvillage to village feasting at the expense of the folk. They are going\r\nto live in their monastery; they want a regular supply of victuals\r\nbrought to them. They must have an overseer in the village, one who will\r\nlook to it that the bread and beer are sent off punctually and are good.\r\nIn the village over which they already have a superiority they acquire a\r\nmanse of their very own, a _mansus indominicatus_ as their foreign\r\nbrethren would call it. When once they are thus established in the\r\nvillage, piety and other-worldliness will do much towards increasing\r\ntheir demesne and strengthening their position[1105].\r\n\r\n[The church and the peasants.]\r\n\r\nWe have argued above that in the first instance it was not by means of\r\nthe petty gifts of private persons that the churches amassed their wide\r\nterritories. The starting point is the alienation of a royal\r\nsuperiority. Still there can be little doubt that the small folk were\r\njust as careful of their souls as were their rulers. They make gifts to\r\nthe church. Moreover, the gift is likely to create a dependent tenure.\r\nThey want to give, and yet they want to keep, for their land is their\r\nlivelihood. They surrender the land to the church: but then they take it\r\nback again as a life-long loan. Thus the church has no great difficulty\r\nabout getting demesne. But further, it gets dependent tenants and a\r\ndependent tenure is established. Like enough on the death of the donor\r\nhis heirs will be suffered to hold what their ancestor held. Very\r\npossibly the church will be glad to make a compromise, for it may be\r\ndoubtful whether these _donationes post obitum_[1106], or these gifts\r\nwith reservation of an usufruct, can be defended against one, who, not\r\nhaving the fear of God before his eyes, will make a determined attack\r\nupon them. Gradually the church becomes more and more interested in the\r\nhusbandry of the village. It receives gifts; it makes loans; it\r\nsubstitutes labour services to be done on its demesne lands for the old\r\n_feorm_ of provender. It is rash to draw inferences from the fragmentary\r\nand obscure laws of Ine; but one of them certainly suggests that, at\r\nleast in some district of Wessex, this process was going on rapidly at\r\nthe end of the seventh century, so rapidly and so oppressively that the\r\nking had to step in to protect the smaller folk. The man who has taken\r\na yard of land at a rent is being compelled not only to pay but also to\r\nlabour. This, says the king, he need not do unless he is provided with a\r\nhouse[1107].\r\n\r\n[Growth of the manorial system.]\r\n\r\nNow we are far from saying that the manorial system of rural economy is\r\nthus invented. From the time of the Teutonic conquest of England onwards\r\nthere may have been servile villages, Roman villas with slaves and\r\n_coloni_ cultivating the owner's demesne, which had passed bodily to a\r\nnew master. We have no evidence that is capable of disproving or of\r\nproving this. What we think more probable is that in those tracts where\r\ntrue villages (nucleated villages, as we have before now called\r\nthem[1108]) were not formed, the conquerors fitted themselves into an\r\nagrarian scheme drawn for them by the Britons, and that in the small\r\nscattered hamlets which existed in these tracts there was all along a\r\ngreat deal of slavery[1109]. But, at any rate, the church was a\r\ncosmopolitan institution. Many a prelate of the ninth and tenth\r\ncenturies, Bishop Oswald for one, must have known well enough how the\r\nforeign monasteries managed their lands, and, whatever controversies may\r\nrage round questions of remoter history, there can be no doubt that by\r\nthis time the rural economy of the church estates in France was in\r\nsubstance that which we know as manorial. Foreign precedents in this as\r\nin other matters may have done a great work in England[1110]. All that\r\nwe are here concerned to show is that there were forces at work which\r\nwere capable of transmuting a village full of free landholders into a\r\nmanor full of villeins.\r\n\r\n[Church-scot and tithe.]\r\n\r\nBesides the rights transferred to it by the king, the church would have\r\nother rights at its command which it could employ for the subjection--we\r\nuse the word in no bad sense--of the peasantry. By the law of God it\r\nmight claim first-fruits and tenths. The payment known as _ciric-sceat_,\r\nchurch-scot, is a very obscure matter[1111]. Certainly in laws of the\r\ntenth century it seems to be put before us as a general tax or rate, due\r\nfrom all lands, and not merely from those lands over which a church has\r\nthe lordship. On the other hand, both in earlier and in later documents\r\nit seems to have a much less general character. In some of the earlier\r\nit looks like a due, we may even say a rent (_ecclesiasticus census_)\r\npaid to a church out of its own lands, while in the later documents, for\r\nexample in Domesday Book, it appears sporadically and looks like a heavy\r\nburden on some lands, a light burden on others. The evidence suggests\r\nthat the church had attempted and on the whole had failed, despite the\r\nhelp of kings and laws, to make this impost general. That in some\r\ndistricts it was a serious incumbrance we may be sure. On those estates\r\nof the church of Worcester to which we have often referred, every hide\r\nwas bound to pay upon St. Martin's day one horse-load (_summa_) of the\r\nbest corn that grew upon it. He who did not pay upon the appointed day\r\nincurred the outrageous penalty of paying twelve-fold, and in addition\r\nto this a fine was inflicted[1112]. If the bishop often insisted on the\r\nletter of this severe rule, he must have reduced many a free ceorl to\r\nbeggary. It is by no means certain that the duty of paying tithe has not\r\na somewhat similar history. Though in this case the impost became a\r\ngeneral burden incumbent on all lands, it may have been a duty of\r\nperfect obligation for the subjects of the churches, while as yet for\r\nthe mass of other landowners it was but a religious duty or even a\r\ncounsel of perfection. At any rate, this subtraction of a tenth of the\r\ngross produce of the earth is no light thing: it is quite capable of\r\ndebasing many men from landownership to dependent tenancy.\r\n\r\n[Jurisdictional rights of the lord.]\r\n\r\nAnother potent instrument for the subjection of the free landowners\r\nwould be the jurisdictional rights which passed from the king to the\r\nchurches and the thegns. At first this transfer would appear as a small\r\nmatter. The president of a court of free men is changed:--that is all.\r\nWhere the king's reeve sat, the bishop or the bishop's reeve now sits;\r\nfines which went to the royal hoard now go to the minster; but a moot of\r\nfree men still administers folk-right to the justiciables of the church.\r\nHowever, in course of time the change will have important effects. In\r\nthe first place, it helps to bind up suit of court with the tenure of\r\nland. The suitor goes to the bishop's court because he holds land of\r\nwhich the bishop is the lord. If, as will often be the case, he wishes\r\nto escape from the burdensome duty, he will pay an annual sum in lieu\r\nthereof, and here is a new rent. Then again all the affairs of the\r\nterritory are now periodically brought under the bishop's eye; he\r\nknows, or his reeves know, all about every one's business and they have\r\ncountless opportunities of granting favours and therefore of driving\r\nbargains. Moreover it is by no means unlikely that the lord will now\r\nhave something to say about the transfer of land, for it is by no means\r\nunlikely that conveyances will be made in court, and that the rod or\r\n_festuca_ which serves as a symbol of possession will be handed by the\r\nseller to the reeve and by the reeve to the purchaser. We need not\r\nregard the conveyance in court as a relic of a time when a village\r\ncommunity would have had a word to say if any of its members proposed to\r\nassign his share to an outsider. There are many reasons for conveying\r\nland in court. We get witnesses there, and no mere mortal witnesses but\r\nthe testimony of a court which does not die. Then, again, there may be\r\nthe claims of expectant heirs to be precluded and perhaps they can be\r\nprecluded by a decree of the court. The seller's kinsfolk can be ordered\r\nto assert their rights within some limited time or else to hold their\r\npeace for ever after, so that the purchaser will hold the land under the\r\ncourt's ban[1113]. And thus the rod passes through the hands of the\r\npresident. But 'nothing for nothing' is a good medieval rule. The lord\r\nwill take a small fine for this _land-cóp_, this sale of land, and soon\r\nit may seem that the purchaser acquires his title to the land rather\r\nfrom the lord than from the vendor[1114].\r\n\r\n[The lord and his man's taxes.]\r\n\r\nYet another turn is given to the screw, if we may so speak, when the\r\nstate and the church begin to hold the lord answerable for taxes which\r\nin the last resort should be paid by the tenant[1115]. This, when we\r\ncall to mind the huge weight of the danegeld, will appear as a matter of\r\nthe utmost importance. Before the end of the tenth century--this is the\r\npicture that we draw for ourselves--large masses of free peasants were\r\nin sore straits and were in many ways subject to their lords. Many of\r\nthem were really holding their tenements by a more or less precarious\r\ntenure. They had taken 'loans' from their lord and become bound to pay\r\nrents and work continuously on his inland. Others of them may have had\r\nancient ancestral titles which could have been traced back to free\r\nsettlers and free conquerors; but for centuries past a lord had wielded\r\nrights over their land. The king's _feorm_ had become the lord's\r\n_gafol_, and this, supplemented by church-scot and by tithes, may have\r\nbeen turned into _gafol_ and week-work. The time came for a new and\r\nheavy tax. This was a crushing burden, and even had the geld been\r\ncollected from the small folk it would have had the effect of converting\r\nmany of them from landowners into landborrowers[1116]. But a worse fate\r\nbefell them. They were so poor that the state could no longer deal with\r\nthem; it dealt with their lord; he paid for their land. It follows that\r\nin the eye of the state their land is his land. Less and less will the\r\nnational courts and the folk-law recognize their titles; the lord\r\n'defends' this land against all the claims of the state; therefore the\r\nstate regards it as his. Hence what seems the primary distinction drawn\r\nby Domesday Book--that between the soke-man and the _villanus_. The\r\n_villanus_ is not rated to the land-tax. Some men are not rated to the\r\ngeld because they have but precarious titles; other men have precarious\r\ntitles because they are not rated to the geld. A wide and a legally\r\ndefinable class is formed of men who hold land and who yet are fast\r\nlosing the warranty of national law. When once the country is full of\r\nlords with sake and soke, a very small change, a very small exhibition\r\nof indifference on the part of the state, will deprive the peasants of\r\nthis warranty and condemn them to hold, not by the law of the land, but\r\nby the custom of their lord's court.\r\n\r\n[Depression of the free ceorl.]\r\n\r\nTo this depth of degradation the great mass of the English peasants in\r\nthe southern and western counties--the _villani_, _bordarii_, _cotarii_\r\nof Domesday Book--may perhaps have come before the Norman Conquest.\r\nThere may have been no courts which would recognize their titles to\r\ntheir land, except the courts of their lords. We are by no means certain\r\nthat even this was so; but they must fall deeper yet before they will be\r\nthe 'serf-villeins' of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[The slaves.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions which would facilitate such a farther fall had\r\nlong been prepared, for slavery had been losing some of its harshest\r\nfeatures. Of this process we have said something elsewhere[1117]. What\r\nthe church did for the slave may have been wisely and was humanely done;\r\nbut what it did for the slave was done to the detriment of the poorer\r\nclasses of free men. By insisting that the slave has a soul to be saved,\r\nthat he can be sinned against and can sin, that his marriage is a\r\nsacrament, we obliterate the line between person and thing. On the other\r\nhand, in the submission of one person to the will of another, a\r\nsubmission which within wide limits is utter and abject, the church saw\r\nno harm. Villeinage and monasticism are not quite independent phenomena;\r\neven a lawyer could see the analogy between the two[1118]. And a touch\r\nof mysticism dignifies slavery:--the bishop of Rome is the serf of the\r\nserfs of God; an earl held land of Westminster Abbey 'like a\r\n_theow_[1119].' One of the surest facts that we know of the England of\r\nCnut's time is that the great folk were confounding their free men with\r\ntheir theowmen and that the king forbad them to do this. We see that one\r\nof the main lines which has separated the rightless slave from the free\r\nceorl is disappearing, for the lord, as suits his interest best, will\r\ntreat the same man now as free and now as bond[1120].\r\n\r\n[Growth of manors from below.]\r\n\r\nWe might here speak of the numerous causes for which in a lawful fashion\r\na free man might be reduced into slavery, and were we to do so, should\r\nhave to notice the criminal law with its extremely heavy tariff of _wer_\r\nand _wite_ and _bót_. But of this enough for the time has been said\r\nelsewhere[1121], and there are many sides of English history at which we\r\ncan not even glance. However, lest we should be charged with a grave\r\nomission, we must explain that the processes which have hitherto come\r\nunder our notice are far from being in our eyes the only processes that\r\ntended towards the creation of manors. We have been thinking of the\r\nmanors as descending from above (if we may so speak) rather than as\r\ngrowing up from below. The alienation of royal rights over villages and\r\nvillagers has been our starting point, and it is to this quarter that we\r\nare inclined to look for the main source of seignorial power. But, no\r\ndoubt, within those villages which had no lords--and plenty of such\r\nvillages there were in 1065--forces were at work which made in the\r\ndirection of manorialism. They are obscure, for they play among small\r\nmen whose doings are not recorded. But we have every reason to suppose\r\nthat in the first half of the eleventh century a fortunate ceorl had\r\nmany opportunities of amassing land and of thriving at the expense of\r\nhis thriftless or unlucky neighbours. Probably the ordinary villager was\r\nseldom far removed from insolvency: that is to say, one raid of\r\nfreebooters, one murrain, two or three bad seasons, would rob him of his\r\nprecious oxen and make him beggar or borrower. The great class of\r\n_bordarii_ who in the east of England are subjected to the sokemen has\r\nprobably been recruited in this fashion[1122]. And so we may see in\r\nCambridgeshire that a man will sometimes have half a hide in one\r\nvillage, a virgate in another, two-thirds of a virgate in a third. He is\r\n'thriving to thegn-right.' Then, again, some prelate or some earl will\r\nperhaps obtain the commendation of all the villagers, and his hold over\r\nthe village will be tightened by a grant of sake and soke, though, if we\r\nmay draw inferences from Cambridgeshire, this seems to have happened\r\nrarely, for the sokemen of a village have often shown a marvellous\r\ndisagreement among themselves in their selection of lords, and seem to\r\nhave chosen light-heartedly between the house of Godwin and the house of\r\nLeofric as if they were but voting for the yellows or the blues. We\r\nfully admit that these forces were doing an important work; but they\r\nwere doing it slowly and it was not nearly achieved when the Normans\r\ncame. Nor was it neat work. It tended to produce not the true and\r\ncompact manerio-villar arrangement, but those loose, dissipated manors\r\nwhich we see sprawling awkwardly over the common fields of the\r\nCambridgeshire townships[1123].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theories which connect the English manor with the Roman\r\nvilla.]\r\n\r\nWe have been endeavouring to show that the legal, social and economic\r\nstructure revealed to us by Domesday Book can be accounted for, even\r\nthough we believe that in the seventh century there was in England a\r\nlarge mass of free landowning ceorls and that many villages were peopled\r\nat that time and at later times chiefly by free landowning ceorls and\r\ntheir slaves. We have now to examine the evidence that is supposed to\r\npoint to a contrary conclusion and to connect the English manor of the\r\neleventh century with the Roman villa of the fifth. Two questions should\r\nbe distinguished from each other--(1) Have we any proof that during\r\nthose six centuries, especially during the first three of them, the type\r\nof rural economy which we know as 'manorial' was prevalent in England?\r\n(2) Have we any proof that the tillers of the soil were for the more\r\npart slaves or unfree men? We will move backwards from Domesday Book.\r\n\r\n[The _Rectitudines_.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place reliance has been placed on the document known as\r\n_Rectitudines Singularum Personarum_[1124]. Of the origin of this we\r\nknow nothing; we can not say for certain that it is many years older\r\nthan the Norman Conquest. Apparently it is the statement of one who is\r\nconcerned in the management of great estates and is desirous of\r\nimparting his knowledge to others. It first sets forth the right of the\r\nthegn. He is worthy of the right given to him by his book. He must do\r\nthree things in respect of his land, namely, fyrdfare, burh-bote and\r\nbridge-work. From many lands however 'a more ample landright arises at\r\nthe king's ban': that is to say, the thegn is subject to other burdens,\r\nsuch as making a deer-hedge at the king's hám, providing warships[1125]\r\nand sea-ward and head-ward and fyrd-ward, and almsfee and church-scot\r\nand many other things. Then we hear of the right of the _geneat_. It\r\nvaries from place to place. In some places he must pay rent\r\n(_land-gafol_) and grass-swine yearly, and ride and carry and lead\r\nloads, work and support his lord[1126], and reap and mow and hew the\r\ndeer-hedge and keep it up, build and hedge the _burh_ and make new roads\r\nfor the _tún_, pay church-scot and almsfee, keep head-ward and\r\nhorse-ward, go errands far and near wherever he is directed. Next we\r\nhear of the cottier's services. He works one day a week and three days\r\nin harvest-time. He ought not to pay rent. He ought to have five acres\r\nmore or less. He pays hearth-penny on Holy Thursday as every free man\r\nshould. He 'defends' or 'acquits' his lord's inland when there is a\r\nsummons for sea-ward or for the king's deer-hedge or the like, as befits\r\nhim, and pays church-scot at Martinmas. Then we have a long statement as\r\nto the services of the _gebúr_. In some places they are heavy, in others\r\nlight. On some land he must work two days a week and three days at\r\nharvest by way of week-work. Besides this there is rent to be paid in\r\nmoney and kind. There is ploughing to be done and there are boon-works.\r\nHe has to feed dogs and find bread for the swine-herd. His beasts must\r\nlie[1127] in his lord's fold from Martinmas to Easter. On the land where\r\nthis custom prevails the _gebúr_ receives by way of outfit two oxen and\r\none cow and six sheep and seven sown acres upon his yard-land. After the\r\nfirst year he is to do his services in full and he is to receive his\r\nworking tools and the furniture for his house. We then hear of the\r\nspecial duties and rights of the bee-keeper, the swine-herd, the\r\nfollower, the sower, ox-herd, shepherd, beadle, woodward, hayward and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n[Discussion of the _Rectitudines_.]\r\n\r\nNow, according to our reading of this document, there stand below the\r\nthegn, but above the serfs (of whom but few words are said[1128]) three\r\nclasses of men--there is the _geneat_, there is the _gebúr_ and there is\r\nthe _cotsetla_. The boor and the cottier are free men; the cottier pays\r\nhis hearth-penny, that is his Romescot, his Peter's-penny, on Holy\r\nThursday as every free man does; but both boor and cottier do week-work.\r\nOn the other hand the _geneat_ does no week-work. He pays a rent, he\r\npays a grass-swine (that is to say he gives a pig or pigs in return for\r\nhis pasture rights), he rides, he carries, he goes errands, he\r\ndischarges the forinsec service due from the manor, and he is under a\r\ngeneral obligation to do whatever his lord commands. He bears a name\r\nwhich has originally been an honourable name; he is his lord's\r\n'fellow[1129].' His services strikingly resemble those which St. Oswald\r\nexacted from his _ministri_, his _equites_, his _milites_[1130]. Almost\r\nevery word that is said of the _geneat_ is true of those very\r\nsubstantial persons who took land-loans from the church of Worcester.\r\nThe _geneat_ (who becomes a _villanus_ in the Latin version of our\r\ndocument that was made by a Norman clerk of Henry I.'s reign) is a\r\nriding-man, radman, radcniht, with a horse, a very different being from\r\nthe _villanus_ of the thirteenth century[1131]. On the other hand, in\r\nthe _gebúr_ of this document we may see the _burus_, who is also the\r\n_colibertus_ of Domesday Book[1132], and he certainly is in a very\r\ndependent position, for his lord provides him with cattle, with\r\ninstruments of husbandry, even with the scanty furniture of his house.\r\nWe dare not indeed argue from this text that the _villanus_ of Domesday\r\nBook does not owe week-work, for the writer who rendered _geneat_ by\r\n_villanus_ was quite unable to understand many parts of the document\r\nthat he was translating[1133]; but when we place the _Rectitudines_ by\r\nthe side of the survey we can hardly avoid the belief that the extremely\r\ndependent _gebúr_ of the former is represented, not by the _villanus_,\r\nbut by the _burus_ or _colibertus_ of the latter. However, over and over\r\nagain the author of the _Rectitudines_ has protested that customs vary.\r\nHe will lay down no general rule; he does but know what goes on in\r\ncertain places[1134].\r\n\r\n[The Tidenham case.]\r\n\r\nIn 956 King Eadwig gave to Bath Abbey thirty manses at Tidenham in\r\nGloucestershire[1135]. A cartulary compiled in the twelfth century\r\ncontains a copy of his gift, and remote from this it contains a\r\nstatement of the services due from the men of Tidenham. It is possible,\r\nbut unlikely, that this statement represents the state of affairs that\r\nexisted at the moment when the minster received the gift; to all\r\nappearance it belongs to a later date[1136]. It begins by stating that\r\nat Tidenham there are 30 hides, 9 of inland and 21 'gesettes landes,'\r\nthat is 9 hides of demesne and 21 hides of land set to tenants. Then\r\nafter an account of the fisheries, which were of importance, it tells us\r\nof the services due from the _geneat_ and from the _gebúr_. The _geneat_\r\nshall work as well on the land as off the land, whichever he is bid, and\r\nride and carry and lead loads and drive droves 'and do many other\r\nthings.' The _gebúr_ must do week-work, of which some particulars are\r\nstated, and he also must pay rent in money and in kind. Here again a\r\nwell marked line is drawn between the _geneat_ and the _gebúr_. Here\r\nagain the _geneat_, like the _cniht_ or _minister_ of Oswaldslaw, is\r\nunder a very general obligation of obedience to his lord; but he is a\r\nriding man and there is nothing whatever to show that he is habitually\r\nemployed in agricultural labour upon his lord's demesne. As to the\r\n_gebúr_, he has to work hard enough day by day, and week by week, though\r\nof his legal status we are told no word.\r\n\r\n[The Stoke case.]\r\n\r\nIn a Winchester cartulary, 'a cartulary of the lowest possible\r\ncharacter,' there stands what purports to be a copy of the charter\r\nwhereby in the year 900 Edward the Elder gave to the church of\r\nWinchester 10 _manentes_ of land 'æt Stoce be Hysseburnan' together with\r\nall the men who were thereon at the time of Alfred's death and all the\r\nmen who were 'æt Hisseburna' at the same period. Edward, we are told,\r\nacquired the land 'æt Stoce' in exchange for land 'æt Ceolseldene' and\r\n'æt Sweoresholte [Sparsholt].' At the end of the would-be charter stand\r\nthe names of its witnesses. Then follows in English (but hardly the\r\nEnglish of the year 900) a statement of the services which the ceorls\r\nshall do 'to Hysseburnan.' Then follow the boundaries. Then the\r\neschatocol of the charter and the list of witnesses is repeated[1137].\r\nOn the face of the copy are three suspicious traits: (1) the modernized\r\nlanguage, (2) the repeated eschatocol, (3) the description of the\r\nservices, for the like is found in no other charter. This is not all.\r\nTwo other documents in the same cartulary bear on the same transaction.\r\nBy the first Edward gave to the church of Winchester 50 _manentes_ 'æt\r\nHysseburnan' which he had obtained by an exchange for land 'æt\r\nMerchamme[1138].' By the second he gave to the church of Winchester 50\r\n_manentes_ 'ad Hursbourne' and other 10 'ad Stoke[1139].' The more\r\ncarefully these three documents are examined, the more difficult will\r\nthe critic find it to acquit the Winchester monks of falsifying their\r\n'books' and improving Edward's gift. Therefore this famous statement\r\nabout the ceorls' services is not the least suspicious part of a highly\r\nsuspicious document. It is to this effect:--'From each _hiwisc_ (family\r\nor hide), at the autumnal equinox, forty pence and six church _mittan_\r\nof ale and three sesters of loaf-wheat. In their own time they shall\r\nplough three acres and sow them with their own seed, and in their own\r\ntime bring it [the produce of the sown land] to barn. They shall pay\r\nthree pounds of gafol barley and mow half an acre of gafol-mead in their\r\nown time and bring it to the rick; four fothers of split gafol-wood for\r\na shingle-rick in their own time and sixteen yards of gafol-fencing in\r\ntheir own time. And at Easter two ewes with two lambs, but two young\r\nsheep may be counted for an old one; and they shall wash and shear sheep\r\nin their own time. And every week they shall do what work they are bid,\r\nexcept three weeks, one at Midwinter, one at Easter and the third at the\r\nGang Days.' Here no doubt, as in the account of Tidenham, as in the\r\n_Rectitudines_, we see what may fairly be called the manorial economy.\r\nThe lord has a village; he has demesne land (_inland_) which is\r\ncultivated for him by the labour of his tenants; these tenants pay\r\n_gafol_ in money or in kind; some of them (the _geneat_ of Tidenham, the\r\n_geneat_ of the _Rectitudines_) assist him when called upon to do so;\r\nothers work steadily from day to day; in many particulars the extent of\r\nthe work due from them is ascertained; whether they are free men,\r\nwhether they are bound to the soil, whether the national courts will\r\nprotect them in their tenure, whether they are slaves, we are not told.\r\n\r\n[Inferences from these cases.]\r\n\r\nThat such an arrangement was common in the eleventh century we know; a\r\nsolitary instance of it comes to us professedly from the first year of\r\nthe tenth, and certainly from a cartulary that is full of lies. To\r\ndraw general inferences from a few such instances would be rash.\r\nWhat should we believe of 'the English village of the eleventh century'\r\nif the one village of which we had any knowledge was Orwell in\r\nCambridgeshire[1140]? What should we believe of 'the English village of\r\nthe thirteenth century' if our only example was a village on the ancient\r\ndemesne? The traces of a manorial economy that have been discovered in\r\nyet remoter times are few, slight and dubious. A passage in the laws of\r\nIne[1141] seems to prove that there were men who had let out small\r\nquantities of land, 'a yard or more,' to cultivators at rents and who\r\nwere wrongfully endeavouring to get from their lessees work as well as\r\n_gafol_. The same law may prove the highly probable proposition that\r\nsome men had taken 'loans' of manses and were paying for them, not only\r\nby _gafol_, but by work done on the lord's land. That already in Ine's\r\nday there were many free men who were needy and had lords above them,\r\nthat already the state was beginning to consecrate the relation between\r\nlord and man as a security for the peace and a protection against crime\r\nis undoubted[1142]. But this does not bring us very near to the Roman\r\n_villa_. Nor shall we see a _villa_ wherever the dooms or the land-books\r\nmake mention of a _hám_ or a _tún_, for the meanest ceorl may have a\r\n_tún_ and will probably have a home of his own[1143].\r\n\r\n[The _villa_ and the _vicus_.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that the England of Bede's day was full of _villae_ and that\r\nBede calls the same place now _villa_ and now _vicus_[1144]. But before\r\nwe enter on any argument about the use of such words, we ought first to\r\nremember that neither Bede nor the scribes of the land-books were\r\ntrained philologists. London is a _villa_[1145], but it is also a\r\n_civitas_, _urbs_, _oppidum_, _vicus_, a _wíc_, a _tún_, a _burh_, and a\r\n_port_. When we see such words as these used promiscuously we must lay\r\nbut little stress upon the occurrence of a particular term in a\r\nparticular case. Suppose for a moment that in England there were many\r\nvillages full of free landholders: what should they be called in Latin?\r\nThey should, it is replied, be called _vici_ and they should not be\r\ncalled _villae_, for a _villa_ is an estate. But it is part of the case\r\nof those who have used this argument that at the time of the barbarian\r\ninvasions the Roman world was full of _villae_, so full that every or\r\nalmost every _vicus_ was situated on and formed part of a _villa_[1146].\r\nWe are therefore exacting a good deal from Bede, from a man who learnt\r\nhis Latin in school, if we require him to be ever mindful of this nice\r\ndistinction. We are saying to him: 'True it is that a knot of\r\nneighbouring houses with the appurtenant lands is habitually called a\r\n_villa_; but then this word introduces the notion of ownership; the\r\n_villa_ is an unit in a system of property law, and, if your village is\r\nnot also an estate, a _praedium_, then you should call it _vicus_ and\r\nnot _villa_.' To this we must add that, while the word _villa_ did not\r\nuntil after the Norman Conquest force its way into English speech, the\r\nword _vicus_ became an English word at a very early period[1147]. It\r\nbecame our word _wick_ and it became part of a very large number of\r\nplace-names[1148]. The Domesday surveyors found _herdwicks_ and\r\n_berewicks_ in many parts of the country[1149]. Moreover we can see\r\nthat in the Latin documents _villa_ is used in the loosest manner.\r\nLondon is a _villa_; but a single house, a single 'haw,' in the city of\r\nCanterbury or the city of Rochester is a _villa_[1150].\r\n\r\n[Notices of manors in the charters.]\r\n\r\nIf we carefully attend to the wording of the land-books, we shall find\r\nthe manorial economy far more visible in the later than in the earlier\r\nof them. The Confessor gives to Westminster 'ða cotlife Perscore and\r\nDorhurste' with all their lands and all their berewicks[1151]. He gives\r\nthe cotlif Eversley and all things of right belonging thereto, with\r\nchurch and mill, with wood and field, with meadow and heath, with water\r\nand with moor[1152]. From 998 we have a gift of a 'heafod-botl,' a\r\ncapital mansion, we may say, and its appurtenances[1153]. In earlier\r\ntimes we may sometimes find that the subject matter of the royal gift is\r\nspoken of as forming a single unit; it is a _villa_, or it is a _vicus_.\r\nBut rarely is the thing that is given called a _villa_ except when the\r\nthing that is given is just a single hide[1154]. If a charter freely\r\ndisposes of several _villae_, meaning thereby villages, we shall\r\nprobably find some other reasons for assigning that charter, whatever\r\ndate it may bear, to the eleventh, the twelfth or a yet later\r\ncentury[1155]. Sometimes in old books the king will say that he is\r\ngiving a _vicus_, a _vicus_ of five or eight or ten _tributarii_[1156].\r\nMuch more frequently he will not speak thus; he will not speak as though\r\nthe subject matter of his gift had a physical unity and individuality.\r\n'I give,' he will say, 'so many _manentes_, _tributarii_, or _casati_\r\nin the place known as _X_,' or 'I give a certain part of my land, to\r\nwit, that of so many _manentes_, _tributarii_, or _casati_ at the spot\r\nwhich men call _Y_.' Such language does not suggest that the manses thus\r\ngiven are subservient to one dominant and dominical manse or manor; it\r\nis very unlike the language of the twelfth century[1157]. Such words as\r\n_fundus_ and _praedium_ are conspicuously absent, and _ager_ usually\r\nmeans but a small piece of land, an acre. Foreign precedents would have\r\nsuggested that when an estate was to be conveyed it should be conveyed\r\n_cum servis et ancillis_, or _cum mancipiis et accolabus_; such clauses\r\nare rare in our English land-books[1158].\r\n\r\n[The _mansa_ and the _manens_.]\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, at all events the king is giving persons, men, as\r\nwell as land; he is giving _manentes_, _casati_, _tributarii_. What is\r\nmore these are foreign words and they describe the 'semi-servile'\r\noccupants of the soil. Now it is true that sometimes he gives\r\n_manentes_, _casati_, _tributarii_, though more often he gives either so\r\nmany manses (_mansas_), or 'the land of so many _manentes_, _casati_,\r\n_tributarii_,' while in Kent he gives plough-lands or sullungs. But we\r\nthink it plain that in England these Latin words were used simply to\r\ndescribe the extent, or rather the rateable extent, of land, without\r\nmuch reference to the number or the quality of its occupants. The _terra\r\nunius manentis_, even the _unus casatus_ when that is the subject of a\r\nconveyance, is like Bede's _terra unius familiae_, the unit known to\r\nEnglishmen as the _hiwisc_, or _hide_[1159]. Hence it is that reference\r\nis so often made to repute and estimation. 'I give,' says Egbert, 'a\r\ncertain portion of land to the amount, as I estimate, of five\r\n_casati_,' or (it may be) 'of twenty _manentes_[1160].' Nothing can be\r\neasier than to count whether there be four, five, or six 'semi-servile'\r\nhouseholds on a given piece of land. Far easier would it be to do this\r\nthan to do what is habitually done, namely, to set forth the boundaries\r\nof the land with laborious precision. But there is already an element of\r\nestimation, of appreciation, in these units. Already they are units in a\r\nsystem of taxation. Hence also it is that so very frequently what the\r\nking gives is just exactly five, or some multiple of five, of these\r\nunits[1161]. Rating is a rough process; five and ten are pleasant\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n[The hide.]\r\n\r\nBut against the argument which would see in every conveyance of 'five\r\n_manentes_' or of 'the land of five _casati_' a conveyance of five\r\nsemi-servile households with their land we have another objection to\r\nurge. Here we will state it briefly; a fuller statement would take us\r\nfar away from our present theme. If the land-books of the churches are\r\nto lead up to Domesday Book, the unit conveyed as _terra unius manentis_\r\n(_casati_, _tributarii_) is a hide with some 120 acres of arable land,\r\nthe land appropriate to a plough-team of eight oxen. Had the\r\nsemi-servile _manens_ as a general rule 120 arable acres, a plough-team\r\nof eight oxen? We do not believe it, and those who have most strongly\r\ninsisted on the servility or 'semi-servility' of the tillers of the\r\nsoil, do not believe it. They would give the _gebúr_ but a quarter of a\r\nhide and but two beasts of the plough. That being so, it should be\r\ncommon ground that the _terra unius manentis_ (_casati_, _tributarii_)\r\ncan not be construed as 'the land occupied by one semi-servile tenant.'\r\nAn explanation of the fact that land is conveyed by reference to units\r\nso large as the hide of 120 acres and that these units are spoken of as\r\nthough each household would normally have one of them must be sought\r\nelsewhere; we can not here pause to find it. But in any case these\r\nforeign terms should give us little trouble. When he hears such words as\r\n_manens_, _casatus_, _tributarius_, the man who has lived in Gaul may\r\nhear some undertone of servility or 'semi-servility.' We do not discuss\r\nthis matter; it may be so. But look at the words themselves, what do\r\nthey primarily mean? A _manens_ is one who dwells upon land, a _casatus_\r\nis one to whom a _casa_ has been allotted, a _tributarius_ pays\r\n_tributum_; the free English landowner pays a _tributum_ to the\r\nking[1162]. We must make the best we can of a foreign, an inappropriate\r\ntongue, and the best that we make is often very bad, especially when we\r\nhave a taste for fine writing. And so England is full of villas which\r\nare Roman and satraps who, no doubt, are Persian.\r\n\r\n[The strip-holding and the villa.]\r\n\r\nAnd whence, we must ask, comes that system of intermixed 'strip-holding'\r\nthat we find in our English fields? Who laid out those fields? The\r\nobvious answer is that they were laid out by men who would sacrifice\r\neconomy and efficiency at the shrine of equality. Each manse is to have\r\nthe same number of strips; the strips of one manse must be neither\r\nbetter nor worse than those of its neighbour and therefore must be\r\nscattered abroad over the whole territory of the village. That this\r\nsystem was not invented by men who owned large continuous tracts is\r\nplain. No such owner would for one moment dream of cutting up his land\r\nin this ridiculous fashion, and of reserving for his own manse, not a\r\nring-fenced demesne, but strips lying here and there, 'hide-meal and\r\nacre-meal' among the strips of his serfs. That is not the theory. No one\r\nsupposes that a Roman landowner whose hands were free allowed the soil\r\nof his villa to be parcelled out in accordance with this wasteful,\r\ncumbrous, barbarous plan. So his hands must not be free; the soil of\r\nwhich he becomes the owner must already be plotted out in strips, and\r\nthese strips must be so tightly bound up into manses, that he scruples\r\nto overturn an existing arrangement, and contents himself with\r\nappropriating a few of the manses for his own use and compelling the\r\noccupants of the others to labour for him and pay him rents. In this\r\nthere is nothing impossible; but we have only deferred, not solved the\r\nproblem. Who laid out our English fields and tied the strips into\r\nmanses? That this work was done by the Britons before they were brought\r\nunder the Roman yoke does not seem very probable. Celtic rural economy,\r\nwhenever it has had a chance of unfettered development, has made for\r\nresults far other than those that are recorded by the larger half of the\r\nmap of England. If throughout England the Romans found so tough a system\r\nof intermixed manses that, despite all its absurdities, they could not\r\nbut spare it, then the Britons who dwelt in the land that was to be\r\nEnglish were many centuries in advance of the Britons who dwelt in the\r\nland that was to be Welsh. To eke out this hypothesis another must be\r\nintroduced. The Teutonic invaders of Britain must be brought from some\r\nmanorialized province. So, after all, the model of the English field may\r\nhave been 'made in Germany.' Somehow or another it was made in South\r\nGermany by semi-servile people, whose semi-servility was such a\r\nhalf-and-half affair that they could not be prevented from sacrificing\r\nevery interest of their lords at the shrine of equality[1163].\r\n\r\n[The lords and the strips.]\r\n\r\nWe are far from saying that wherever there is strip-holding, there\r\nliberty and equality have once reigned[1164]. It is very possible that\r\nwhere a barbarian chieftain obtained a ring-fenced allotment of\r\nconquered soil, he sometimes divided it into scattered strips which he\r\nparcelled out among his unfree dependants. But if he did this, he did it\r\nbecause his only idea of agriculture was derived from a village formed\r\nby men who were free and equal. The maintenance of a system of\r\nintermixed strip-holding may be due to seignorial power, and a great\r\ndeal of the rigidity of the agrarian arrangements that we see in the\r\nEngland of the thirteenth century may be due to the same cause.\r\nSeignorial power was not, at least in origin, absolute ownership. It had\r\nto make the best it could of an existing system. For the lord's purposes\r\nthat system was at its best when it was rigid and no tenement was\r\npartible. But assuredly this plan was not originally invented by great\r\nproprietors who were seeking to get the most they could out of their\r\nland, their slaves and their capital.\r\n\r\n[The ceorl and the slave.]\r\n\r\nThat we have not been denying the existence of slavery will be plain.\r\nIndeed we may strongly suspect that the men who parcelled out our fields\r\nwere for the more part slave-owners, though slave-owners in a very small\r\nway. To say nothing of Welshmen, there was quite enough inter-tribal\r\nwarfare to supply the ceorl with a captive. But it was not for the sake\r\nof slaves or serfs or 'semi-servile' folk that the system of intermixed\r\nstrips was introduced.\r\n\r\n[The condition of the Danelaw.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the theory which would derive the English manor from the Roman\r\n_villa_ must face the grave problem presented to it by the account which\r\nDomesday Book, when speaking of the Confessor's day, gives of the\r\neastern and northern counties, of a large quarter of all England, and of\r\njust that part of England which was populous. We see swarms of men who\r\nare free men but who are subject, they and their land, to various modes\r\nand degrees of seignorial power. The modes are many, the degrees are\r\ngentle. Personal, tenurial, justiciary threads are woven into a web that\r\nbewilders us. Here we see the work of commendation, there the work of\r\nthe land-loan, and there again what comes of grants of sake and soke. We\r\nsee the formation of manors taking place under our eyes, and as yet the\r\nprocess is by no means perfect. In village after village there is\r\nnothing that our economic historians would consent to call a manor. Now,\r\nno doubt, the difference between the east and the west is, at least in\r\npart, due to Danish invasions and Danish settlements. But how shall we\r\npicture to ourselves the action of the Danes? Is it to be supposed that\r\nthey found the Anglo-Roman manor-villa a prevalent and prosperous\r\ninstitution, that they destroyed it and put something else in its place,\r\nput in its place the village of free peasants who could 'go with their\r\nland' to what lord they pleased? If so, then we have to face the\r\nquestion why these heathen Danes acted in a manner so different from\r\nthat in which their predecessors, the heathen Angles and Saxons, had\r\nacted. Surely one part of the explanation is that the inswarming\r\nbarbarians checked the manorializing process that was steadily at work\r\nin Wessex and Mercia. We do not say that this is the whole explanation.\r\nWe have seen how free were many of the Cambridgeshire villages and have\r\nlittle reason to believe that they had been settled by Danes[1165]. The\r\nwest country is the country to which we shall naturally look for the\r\nmost abundant traces of the _Wealh theow_. There it is that we find\r\nnumerous _servi_, and there that we find rather _trevs_ than villages.\r\nBut also we have hardly a single land-book of early date which deals\r\nwith any part of the territory that became the Danelaw. Many a book the\r\nDanes may have burnt when they sacked the monasteries. They sacked the\r\nmonasteries, burnt the books and freed the land. But still we may doubt\r\nwhether the practice of booking lands to the churches had gone far in\r\nEast Anglia and the adjacent shires when they were once more overwhelmed\r\nby barbarism. No doubt in course of time the churches of the east became\r\nrich: Ely and St Edmunds, Peterborough and Ramsey, Croyland and Thorney.\r\nBut, even when supplemented by legend and forgery, their titles to wide\r\nterritories can seldom be compared for antiquity to the titles that\r\nmight have been pleaded by the churches of Kent and Wessex and the\r\nSevern Valley. Richly endowed churches mean a subjected peasantry. And\r\nthus we may say of the Danes that if in a certain sense they freed the\r\ndistricts which they conquered, they in the same sense enslaved the rest\r\nof England. Year by year Wessex and Mercia had to strain every nerve in\r\norder to repel the pagans, to fit out fleets, build burgs and keep\r\narmies always in the field. The peasant must in the end bear the cost of\r\nthis exhausting struggle. Meanwhile in the north and the east the\r\nprocess that makes manors has been interrupted; it must be begun once\r\nmore. It was accomplished by men some of whom had Scandinavian blood in\r\ntheir veins, but who were not heathens, not barbarians: it was\r\naccomplished by Normans steeped in Frankish feudalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1101] K. 313 (ii. 110); T. 129; B. ii. 172.\r\n\r\n  [1102] In many cases the one night's farm is reckoned at £100 or\r\n         thereabouts; Round, Feudal England, 112.\r\n\r\n  [1103] K. 477 (ii. 354); T. 509.\r\n\r\n  [1104] Vinogradoff, Villainage, 301.\r\n\r\n  [1105] Even T.

Cf. D. B. i. 172 b:\r\n         'deserviebat sicut episcopus volebat' ... 'tenuit ad\r\n         servitium quod episcopus voluit.' The translator who turned\r\n         him into a villanus was capable of turning the king's\r\n         _geneat_ of Ine's law into a _colonus_, a _colonus_ with a\r\n         wergild of 1200 shillings! See Schmid, p. 29.\r\n\r\n  [1132] See above, p. 36.\r\n\r\n  [1133] See e.g. cap. i., where it is pretty clear that he can not\r\n         translate _scorp_. So in the Latin version of Edgar II. c. 1\r\n         he renders _geneatland_ by _terra villanorum_. But about such\r\n         a matter as this the testimony of the Quadripartitus is of no\r\n         value. See Liebermann, Gerefa, Anglia, ix. 258.\r\n\r\n  [1134] Mr Seebohm, p. 130, commits what seems to me the mistake of\r\n         saying that the cottiers and boors are 'various classes of\r\n         geneats.' To my thinking a great contrast is drawn between\r\n         the _geneat_ and the _gebúr_ both in this document and in the\r\n         account of Tidenham. So in Edgar II. c. 1 the contrast is\r\n         between land which the great man has in hand and land which\r\n         he has let to his 'fellows,' his _equites_ and _ministri_.\r\n         See Konrad Maurer, K. U. ii. 405-6. Such words as _gebúr_ and\r\n         _burus_ are obviously very loose words and it is likely that\r\n         many a man who answered to the description of the _gebúr_\r\n         given by the Rectitudines appears in Domesday Book, which in\r\n         general cares only about fiscal distinctions, as a _villanus_\r\n         or _bordarius_. But we have clear proof that the surveyors\r\n         saw a class of _buri_ ( = _coliberti_) who were distinct from\r\n         the ordinary _villani_. See above, p. 36.\r\n\r\n  [1135] K. 452 (ii. 327). See also Two Chartularies of Bath Abbey\r\n         (Somerset Record Society), pp. 5, 18, 19.\r\n\r\n  [1136] K. iii. 449; E. 375: Seebohm, 148.

The statement of services\r\n         immediately precedes the lease of Tidenham to Stigand, K. 822\r\n         (iv. 171).

In\r\n         the translation of St. Mark viii. 23, 26 both _wíc_ and _tun_\r\n         are used as equivalents for _vicus_:--'eduxit eum extra vicum\r\n         ... et si in vicum introieris' = 'and lædde hine butan þa wic\r\n         ... and ðeah þu on tun ga.'

It\r\n         is often used to distinguish a hamlet or small cluster of\r\n         houses separate from the main village. Thus in the parish of\r\n         _X_ we shall find _X-wick_. The _berewicks_ and _herdwicks_\r\n         of D. B. (see above, p. 114) seem to be small clusters.

It is not denied\r\n         that in some quite early charters a king gives a _villa_ or\r\n         _villula_, e.g. K. 209 (i. 264): 'Heallingan cum villulis\r\n         suis'; see also K. 140 (i. 169), in which _villula_ and\r\n         _viculus_ are used as synonyms.\r\n\r\n  [1155] A good example is that abominable forgery K. 984 (v. 2),\r\n         Wulfhere's charter for Peterborough.\r\n\r\n  [1156] For example, K. 117-8-20 (i. 144-7).\r\n\r\n  [1157] One of the earliest instances of what looks like manorial\r\n         organization will be found in K. 201 (i. 253); B. i. 485. In\r\n         814 Cenwulf gives to the Abp. of Canterbury a plough-land:\r\n         'et hoc aratrum cum omnibus utensilibus bonis ad mansionem in\r\n         grafon æa [Graveney] æternaliter concessum est.'\r\n\r\n  [1158] A.D. 880, K. 311 (ii. 107): 'Insuper etiam huic donationi in\r\n         augmentum sex homines, qui prius pertinebant ad villam regiam\r\n         in Beonsinctune, cum omni prole stirpeque eorum ad eandem\r\n         conscripsimus aecclesiam.' A.D. 889, K. 315 (ii. 117): 'cum\r\n         hominibus ad illam pertinentibus.' A.D. 962, K. 1239 (vi.\r\n         49): 'vineam ... cum vinitoribus.' In late documents penned\r\n         in English it is common to convey land 'with meat and with\r\n         man.' Instances are collected in Crawford Charters, 127.\r\n\r\n  [1159] Therefore we sometimes meet with the form _cassata_, while\r\n         _manens_ is treated as a feminine word; K. i. 301; B. i. 573:\r\n         'has x. manentes ... dividendas dimisit.' So Asser (ed.\r\n         Camden, p. 4) says that Æthelwulf ordered that one poor man\r\n         should be fed and clothed 'per omnem hereditariam terram suam\r\n         semper in x. manentibus.'\r\n\r\n  [1160] K. 1033 (v. 73): 'aliquam portionem terrae ... in modum\r\n         videlicet ut autumo v. cassatorum.' K. 1308 (v. 83): 'aliquam\r\n         portionem terrae ... in modum videlicet ut autumo xx.\r\n         manentium.' K. 565 (iii. 64): 'quoddam ruris clima sub\r\n         aestimatione decem cassatorum.' K. 573 (iii. 87): 'ruris\r\n         quandam particulam, denis ab accolis aestimatam\r\n         mansiunculis.' K. 602 (iii. 146): 'quoddam rus x. videlicet\r\n         mansarum quantitate taxatum.'\r\n\r\n  [1161] Let us open the Cod. Dipl. at the beginning of Edmund's reign\r\n         (ii. 218). The number of manses given in twenty-five\r\n         consecutive charters is as follows: 10, 20, 10, 10, 9, 10,\r\n         15, 7, 8, 20, 10, 3, 5, 20, 30, 3, 6, 5, 3, 7, 20, 20, 5, 8,\r\n         5.\r\n\r\n  [1162] It seems almost necessary to protest that to-day our\r\n         landowners are not semi-servile occupants of the soil, though\r\n         they pay land taxes, house taxes, income taxes and rates\r\n         innumerable.\r\n\r\n  [1163] I can not but think that Fustel de Coulanges knew his\r\n         business thoroughly well, and that if the German is to be\r\n         taught his proper and insignificant place, the less that is\r\n         said of intermixed 'strip-holding' the better, though to\r\n         ignore it utterly was, even in France, a bold course.\r\n\r\n  [1164] Meitzen, op. cit. i. 431-41.\r\n\r\n  [1165] See above, p. 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Village Community._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The village community.]\r\n\r\nWe have argued for an England in which there were many free villages. It\r\nremains for us to say a word of the doctrines which would fill England\r\nwith free landowning village communities. Here we enter a misty region\r\nwhere arguments suggested by what are thought to be 'survivals' and\r\ninferences drawn from other climes or other ages take the place of\r\ndocuments. We are among guesses and little has as yet been proved.\r\n\r\n[The popular theory.]\r\n\r\nA popular theory teaches us that land belonged to communities before it\r\nbelonged to individuals. This theory has the great merit of being vague\r\nand elastic; but, as it seems to think itself precise, and probably owes\r\nsome of its popularity to its pretence of precision, we feel it our duty\r\nto point out to it its real merit, its vague elasticity.\r\n\r\n[Co-ownership and ownership by corporations.]\r\n\r\nIt apparently attributes the ownership of land to communities. It\r\ncontrasts communities with individuals. In so doing it seems to hint,\r\nand yet to be afraid of saying, that land was owned by corporations\r\nbefore it was owned by men. The hesitation we can understand. No one who\r\nhas paid any attention to the history of law is likely to maintain with\r\na grave face that the ownership of land was attributed to fictitious\r\npersons before it was attributed to men. But if we abandon ownership by\r\ncorporations and place in its stead co-ownership, then we seem to be\r\nmaking an unfortunate use of words if we say that land belonged to\r\ncommunities before it belonged to individuals. Co-ownership is ownership\r\nby individuals. When at the present day an English landowner dies and\r\nhis land descends to his ten daughters, it is owned by individuals, by\r\nten individuals. If each of these ten ladies died intestate leaving ten\r\ndaughters, the land would still be owned by individuals, by a hundred\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n['Communities' as owners.]\r\n\r\nThe distinction that modern law draws between the landowning corporation\r\nand the group of co-owners is as sharp as any distinction can be. It\r\nwill be daily brought home to any one who takes an active share in the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of a corporation, for example, a small college\r\nwhich has a master, six fellows and eight scholars. A conveyance of land\r\nto the college and a conveyance of land to these fifteen men would have\r\nutterly different effects. A corporation may be deep in debt while none\r\nof its members owes a farthing. Now we may suspect, and not without\r\nwarrant, that in a remote past these two very different notions, namely\r\nthat of land owned by a corporation and that of land owned by a group of\r\nco-owners were intimately blent in some much vaguer notion that was\r\nneither exactly the one nor exactly the other. We may suspect that could\r\nwe examine the conduct of certain men who lived long ago we should be\r\nsorely puzzled to say whether they were behaving as the co-owners of a\r\ntract of land or as the members of a corporation which was its owner.\r\nBut to fashion for ourselves any clear and stable notion of a _tertium\r\nquid_ that is neither corporate ownership nor co-ownership, but partly\r\nthe one and partly the other, seems impossible[1166]. Therefore if, in\r\naccordance with the popular theory, we attribute the ownership of lands\r\nto 'communities,' we ought to add that we do not attribute it to\r\ncorporations and that we are fully aware that co-ownership can not be\r\nsharply contrasted with ownership by individuals.\r\n\r\n[Possession and ownership.]\r\n\r\nAlso since we are apt to fall into the trick of talking about possession\r\nwhen we mean ownership or proprietary right, we need not perhaps ask\r\npardon for the remark that land owned by a group of three joint tenants\r\nmay be possessed in many different ways. The three may be jointly\r\npossessing the whole; each may be severally possessing a physically\r\ndivided third; the whole may be possessed by one of them or by some\r\nfourth person; the possession may be rightful or wrongful.\r\n\r\nBut there is a graver question that must be raised. When we say that\r\nland belonged to communities before it belonged to individuals, are we\r\nreally speaking of ownership or of something else?\r\n\r\n[Ownership and governmental power.]\r\n\r\nAt the present day no two legal ideas seem more distinct from each other\r\nthan that of governmental power and that of proprietary right. The\r\n'sovereign' of Great Britain (be the sovereignty where it may) is not\r\nthe owner of Great Britain, and if we still say that all land is 'held\r\nof' the king, we know that the abolition of this antique dogma, this\r\n_caput mortuum_, might be easily accomplished without any perceptible\r\nrevolution in the practical rules of English law. A landowner in the\r\nUnited States does not 'hold of' the State or the people or the\r\ngovernment of the State. The 'eminent domain' of the State is neither\r\nownership nor any mode of ownership. Further, we conceive that the\r\nsovereign person or sovereign body can, without claiming any ownership\r\nin the soil, place many restrictions on the use that an owner may make\r\nof his land. A law may prohibit owners from building on certain lands:\r\nthose lands are still their lands. Again, the supposed law may be not a\r\nnegative but a positive rule; it may require that the owners of certain\r\nlands shall build upon them, or shall till them, or shall keep them as\r\npasture[1167]: still neither state nor sovereign will be owner of those\r\nlands or have any proprietary interest in them. Our law may subject\r\ncertain lands to a land-tax to be paid to the state in money, or to a\r\ntithe to be paid to the church in kind, but the state will not and the\r\nchurch will not be part-owner of those lands. Our state may habitually\r\nexpropriate owners, may take their lands from them because they are\r\nfelons or because their lands are wanted for the construction of\r\nrailways. We may conceive it expropriating owners who have done no wrong\r\nand yet are to have no compensation; but until the expropriation takes\r\nplace the state does not own the land. As with land, so with chattels.\r\nThe owner of a cart may find that it is impressed for the purpose of\r\nmilitary transport[1168] and yet the cart is his and not the state's.\r\n\r\n[Ownership and the powers of subordinate governors.]\r\n\r\nSimilar powers may be exercised by persons or bodies that are not\r\nsovereign, for example, by the governor of a province, by a county\r\ncouncil or a municipal corporation. Suppose that the owners of land\r\nsituate within a certain borough are prohibited by a by-law from placing\r\non their soil any buildings the plans of which have not been approved by\r\nthe town council. Carry this supposition further:--suppose that the town\r\ncouncil is a 'folk-moot' which every inhabitant of the borough may\r\nattend. Still, according to our thinking, there would here be no\r\ncommunal ownership and no division of ownership between individuals and\r\na corporation. If we thought it well to say that in such a case the\r\ncommunity would have some kind of 'eminent domain' over the land of\r\nindividuals, we should have to add that this kind of eminent domain was\r\nnot a proprietary right, but merely governmental power, a power of\r\nmaking general rules and issuing particular commands. Nor would the case\r\nbe altered if the expressed object of such rules and commands was the\r\ninterest, it may even be the pecuniary interest, of the men of the town.\r\nThe erection of buildings may be controlled in order that the town may\r\nbe wholesome and sightly, or we may conceive that landowners in the\r\nsuburbs are compelled to keep their land as market-gardens or as\r\ndairy-forms in order that vegetables or milk may be cheap:--for all this\r\nthe town council or community of townsfolk would have no property in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n[Evolution of sovereignty and ownership.]\r\n\r\nBut though this be so, we can not doubt that could we trace back these\r\nideas to their origin, we should come to a time when they were hardly\r\ndistinct from each other. The language of our medieval law tells us that\r\nthis is so. The one word _dominium_ has to cover both proprietary rights\r\nand many kinds of political power; it stands for ownership, lordship,\r\nsovereignty, suzerainty. The power that Edward I. wields over all\r\nEngland, the power that he claims over all Scotland, all Gascony, the\r\nright that he has in his palace of Westminster, the right that he has in\r\nhis war-horse, all these are but modes of _dominium_. Then we imagine a\r\nbarbarous horde invading a country, putting its inhabitants to the sword\r\nand defending it against all comers. Doubtless in some sort the land is\r\nits land. But in what sort? In the sort in which Queen Victoria or the\r\nBritish nation has lands in every quarter of the globe, the sort in\r\nwhich all France belongs to the French Republic, or the sort in which\r\nBlackacre is the land of John Styles? Have the barbarians themselves\r\nanswered this question? Have they asked it[1169]?\r\n\r\n[Communal ownership as a stage.]\r\n\r\nNow if we are going to confuse sovereignty with ownership, _imperium_\r\nwith _dominium_, political power with proprietary right, why then let\r\nour socialists and collectivists cease their striving and sing _Te\r\nDeum_. Already their ideal must be attained. Every inch of the soil of\r\nFrance, to name one instance, 'belongs' to the French Republic. But, if\r\nwe would not be guilty of this confusion, then we must be very careful\r\nbefore we assent to the proposition that in the normal course of history\r\n(if indeed in such a context history can be said to have a normal\r\ncourse) the ownership of land by communities appears before the\r\nownership of land by individuals. Even if we put aside all such\r\ncriticisms as would be legal quibbles in the eyes of impatient\r\ntheorists, and refuse to say whether the 'community' is a mass of men,\r\nan ideal person or _tertium quid_, we still are likely to find that the\r\nanthropologists will be against us. We are now told by one of the\r\nacutest of explorers that, if we leave out of account as no true case of\r\nownership the sort of inchoate sovereignty which an independent tribe\r\nof hunters may exercise over a piece of the world's surface, 'ownership\r\nof land by individuals' is to be found at a much lower grade in the\r\nscale of civilization than that at which 'communal ownership' makes its\r\nfirst appearance[1170]. Communal ownership, it is said, is not seen\r\nuntil that stage is reached at which the power of the chieftain is\r\nalready a considerable force and the work of centralization is\r\nprogressing. With these inductions we do not meddle; but if the\r\nanthropologist will concede to the historian that he need not start from\r\ncommunalism as from a necessary and primitive _datum_, a large room will\r\nbe open for our guesses when we speculate about the doings of a race of\r\nbarbarians who have come into contact with Roman ideas. Even had our\r\nanthropologists at their command materials that would justify them in\r\nprescribing a normal programme for the human race and in decreeing that\r\nevery independent portion of mankind must, if it is to move at all, move\r\nthrough one fated series of stages which may be designated as Stage _A_,\r\nStage _B_, Stage _C_ and so forth, we still should have to face the fact\r\nthat the rapidly progressive groups have been just those which have not\r\nbeen independent, which have not worked out their own salvation, but\r\nhave appropriated alien ideas and have thus been enabled, for anything\r\nthat we can tell, to leap from Stage _A_ to Stage _X_ without passing\r\nthrough any intermediate stages. Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors did not\r\narrive at the alphabet, or at the Nicene Creed, by traversing a long\r\nseries of 'stages'; they leapt to the one and to the other.\r\n\r\n[A normal sequence of stages.]\r\n\r\nBut in truth we are learning that the attempt to construct a normal\r\nprogramme for all portions of mankind is idle and unscientific. For one\r\nthing, the number of such portions that we can with any plausibility\r\ntreat as independent is very small. For another, such is the complexity\r\nof human affairs and such their interdependence, that we can not hope\r\nfor scientific laws which will formulate a sequence of stages in any one\r\nprovince of man's activity. We can not, for instance, find a law which\r\ndeals only with political and neglects proprietary arrangements, or a\r\nlaw which deals only with property and neglects religion. So soon as we\r\npenetrate below the surface, each of the cases whence we would induce\r\nour law begins to look extremely unique, and we shall hesitate long\r\nbefore we fill up the blanks that occur in the history of one nation by\r\ninstitutions and processes that have been observed in some other\r\nquarter. If we are in haste to drive the men of every race past all the\r\nknown 'stages,' if we force our reluctant forefathers through agnatic\r\n_gentes_ and house-communities and the rest of it, our normal programme\r\nfor the human race is like to become a grotesque assortment of odds and\r\nends.\r\n\r\n[Was land owned by village communities?]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question whether in the history of our own people\r\nwe ought to suppose any definite 'stage' intermediate between the\r\nintroduction of steady agriculture and the ownership of land by\r\nindividuals. To say the least, we have no proof that among the Germans\r\nthe land was continuously tilled before it was owned by individuals or\r\nby those small groups that constituted the households. This seems to be\r\nso whether we have regard to the country in which the Germans had once\r\nlived as nomads or to those Celtic and Roman lands which they subdued.\r\nTo Gaul and to Britain they seem to have brought with them the idea that\r\nthe cultivable land should be allotted in severalty. In some cases they\r\nfitted themselves into the agrarian framework that they found; in other\r\ncases they formed villages closely resembling those that they had left\r\nbehind them in their older home. But to all appearance, even in that\r\nolder home, so soon as the village was formed and had ploughed lands\r\naround it, the strips into which those fields were divided were owned in\r\nseveralty by the householders of the village. Great pains had been taken\r\nto make the division equitable; each householder was to have strips\r\nequal in number and in value, and to secure equivalence each was to have\r\na strip in every part of the arable territory. But our evidence, though\r\nit may point to some co-operation in agriculture, does not point to a\r\ncommunistic division of the fruits[1171]. Nor does it point to a time\r\nwhen a village council or a majority of villagers conceived that it had\r\npower to re-allot the arable strips at regular or irregular\r\nintervals[1172]. On the contrary, the individual's hold upon his strips\r\ndeveloped very rapidly into an inheritable and partible ownership. No\r\ndoubt this ownership grew more intense as time went on. It is a common\r\nremark that during yet recent ages the ownership of land that is known\r\nto our law has been growing more intense. This is true and patent\r\nenough; the landowner has gained powers of alienation that his\r\npredecessors did not enjoy. Possibly the only ownership of land that was\r\nknown to the Lex Salica was inalienable and could be inherited only by\r\nsons of the dead owner. Then again, in old days a trespass that did no\r\nharm would have been no trespass. 'Nominal damages' are no primitive\r\ninstitution, and for a long time a man may have had no action if strange\r\ncattle browsed over land on which no crop of corn was ripening[1173].\r\nBut this growing intensity of ownership may be seen also in the case of\r\nmovable goods. Indeed there is a sense in which English law may be said\r\nto have known a full ownership of land long ages before it knew a full\r\nownership of chattels[1174]. What, however, we are concerned to observe\r\nis that the German village community does not seem to have resisted this\r\ndevelopment of ownership or set up for itself any antagonistic\r\nproprietary claim. It sought no more as regards the arable fields than a\r\ncertain power of regulating their culture, and in old times the\r\n_Flurzwang_, the customary rotation of crop and fallow, must have\r\nappeared less as the outcome of human ordinance than as an unalterable\r\narrangement established by the nature of things in general and of acre\r\nstrips in particular[1175].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meadows, pasture and wood.]\r\n\r\nThus, so far back as we can see, the German village had a solid core of\r\nindividualism. There were, however, lands which in a certain sense\r\nbelonged to it and which were not allotted for good and all among its\r\nvarious members. For one thing, the meadows were often subjected to a\r\nmore communal scheme. In the later middle ages we may see them annually\r\nredistributed by rotation or by lot among the owners of the arable. The\r\nmeadows, which must be sharply distinguished from the pasture, were few,\r\nand, as we may see from Domesday and other records, they were\r\nexceedingly valuable. Probably their great but varying value stood in\r\nthe way of any permanent partition that would have seemed equitable.\r\nStill they were allotted annually and the right to an allotment 'ran\r\nwith' the house and the arable strips. But again, there were woods and\r\npastures. If we must at once find an owner for this _Almende_, we may be\r\ninclined to place the ownership in a village community, though not\r\nwithout remembering that if this community may develop into a\r\nland-owning corporation, it may develop into a group of co-owners. But\r\nin all likelihood the question as to the whereabouts of ownership might\r\ngo unanswered and unasked for a long time. Rights of user exercisable\r\nover these woods and pastures were attached to the ownership of the\r\nhouses and the arable strips, and such 'rights of common' may take that\r\nacutely individualistic form which they seem to have taken in the\r\nEngland of the thirteenth century. The freeholder of 'ancient arable,'\r\nwhose tenement represents one of the original shares, has a right to\r\nturn out beasts on the waste, on the whole waste and every inch of it,\r\nand of this right nor lord, nor community can deprive him[1176]. Perhaps\r\nwe may attribute to our law about this matter an unusual and, in a\r\ncertain sense, an abnormal individualism. In the much governed England\r\nof the Angevin time, the strong central power encouraged every\r\nfreeholder to look to it for relief against all kinds of pressure\r\nseignorial or communal. Elsewhere a village moot may assume and retain\r\nsome control over these pasture rights. But still the untilled land, the\r\nwaste, the _Almende_, exists mainly, if not solely, for the benefit of a\r\nsmall group of tenements that are owned and possessed in severalty. As\r\nto the ownership of the land that is subject to the rights of pasture,\r\nit is a nude, a very nude _dominium_, and for a long while no one gives\r\nit a thought.\r\n\r\n[The bond between neighbours.]\r\n\r\nIn a favourable environment the German village community may and will\r\nbecome a landowning corporation. But many dangers lie before it:\r\ninternal as well as external dangers. We must not think of it as a\r\nclosely knit body of men. The agrarian is almost the only tie that keeps\r\nit together. Originally the men who settle down in a village are likely\r\nto be kinsmen. Some phrases in the continental folk-laws, and some\r\nperhaps of our English place-names, point in this direction. But\r\n(explain this how we will) the German system of kinship, which binds men\r\ntogether by the sacred tie of blood-feud, traces blood both through\r\nfather and through mother, and therefore will not suffer a\r\n'blood-feud-kin' to have either a local habitation or a name[1177]. Very\r\nsoon, especially if daughters or the sons of daughters are allowed (and\r\nvery ancient Frankish laws allow them) to inherit the dead man's land, a\r\nman who lives in one village will often be closer of kin to men who live\r\nin other villages than to his neighbours. The village community was not\r\na _gens_. The bond of blood was sacred, but it did not tie the Germans\r\ninto mutually exclusive clans. Nor did it hold them in large\r\n'house-communities,' for the partible inheritance seems as a general\r\nrule to have been soon partitioned[1178]. Nor again may we ascribe to\r\nthe German house-father much power over his full-grown sons[1179].\r\n\r\n[Feebleness of the village community.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the village community was not a body that could declare the\r\nlaw of the tribe or nation. It had no court, no jurisdiction. If moots\r\nwere held in it, these would be comparable rather to meetings of\r\nshareholders than to sessions of a tribunal. In short, the village\r\nlandowners formed a group of men whose economic affairs were\r\ninextricably intermixed, but this was almost the only principle that\r\nmade them an unit, unless and until the state began to use the township\r\nas its organ for the maintenance of the peace and the collection of\r\ntaxes. That is the reason why we read little of the township in our\r\nAnglo-Saxon dooms[1180]. Only as the state's pressure increases, does\r\nthe vill become one of the public institutions of the kingdom. We may\r\neven exaggerate the amount of agricultural co-operation that was to be\r\nfound within it. Beyond the age in which the typical peasant is a\r\nvirgater contributing two oxen to a team of eight, our English evidence\r\nseems to point to a time when the normal 'townsman' held a hide and had\r\nslaves and oxen enough for its cultivation. Nor in all probability was\r\nthe village community a large body. We may doubt whether in the oldest\r\ndays it usually comprised more than some ten shareholders[1181].\r\n\r\n[Absence of organization.]\r\n\r\nWhatever might come in course of time, we must not suppose that the\r\nvillage had much that could be called a constitution. In particular, we\r\nmust be careful not to carry too far back the notion that votes will be\r\ncounted and that the voice of a majority will be treated as the voice of\r\nall. When that marvellous title _De migrantibus_ raises a corner of the\r\ncurtain and gives us our only glance into a village of newly settled\r\nSalian Franks, the one indisputable trait that we see among much that is\r\ndisputable is that the new-comer must leave the village if one villager\r\nobjects to his presence. His presence, we may suppose, might be\r\nobjectionable because it might add to the number of those who enjoyed\r\nwood, waste and water in common; but any one villager can insist on his\r\ndeparture. Out of this state of things 'communal ownership' may grow;\r\nbut all the communalism that we see at present is very like\r\nindividualism[1182]. Above all, we must not picture these village lands\r\nas 'impressed with a trust' in favour of unborn generations or as\r\ndevoted to 'public purposes.' If in course of time small folk, cottiers,\r\n'under-settles' and the like, are found in the village, they will have\r\nto struggle for rights in the waste, and the rights, if any, that they\r\nget will be meagre when compared with those of the owners of 'whole\r\nlands' and 'half lands.' An oligarchy of peasant proprietors may rule\r\nthe waste and the village.\r\n\r\n[The German village on conquered soil.]\r\n\r\nThus even in favourable circumstances there were many difficulties to be\r\novercome if the communalism, such as it was, of the village community\r\nwas to be maintained and developed. But where the village was founded\r\nupon conquered soil the circumstances were not favourable. If the\r\nGermans invaded Gaul or Britain, the very fields themselves seemed to\r\nrebel against communalism and to demand a ring-fenced severalty.\r\nThroughout large tracts in Gaul the barbarians were content to adapt\r\nthemselves to the shell that was provided for them. A certain aliquot\r\nshare of every estate might be taken from its former owner and be\r\nallotted to a Burgundian or a Goth according to a uniform plan[1183].\r\nThroughout other large tracts villages of the Germanic type were\r\nfounded; a large part of northern Gaul was studded with such villages,\r\nand it may be well for us to remember that some of our Norman\r\nsubjugators came to us from a land of villages, if others came from a\r\nland of isolated homesteads[1184]. There can be little doubt that in\r\nBritain numerous villages were formed which reproduced in all essentials\r\nthe villages which Saxons and Angles had left behind them on the\r\nmainland, and as little doubt that very often, in the west and\r\nsouth-west of Britain, German kings and eorls took to themselves\r\nintegral estates, the boundaries and agrarian arrangement whereof had\r\nbeen drawn by Romans, or rather by Celts[1185].\r\n\r\n[Development of kingly power.]\r\n\r\nThen the invasions and the long wars called for a rapid development of\r\nkingship. Very quickly the Frankish kingship became despotism. In\r\nEngland also the kings became powerful and the hereditary nobles\r\ndisappeared. There was taxation. The country was plotted out according\r\nto some rude scheme to provide the king with meat and cheese and\r\nale[1186]. Then came bishops and priests with the suggestion that he\r\nshould devote his revenues to the service of God and with forms of\r\nconveyance which made him speak as if the whole land were his to give\r\naway. Here, so we have argued, was the beginning of a process which\r\nplaced many a village under a lord. The words of this lord's 'book' told\r\nhim that he was owner, or at least lord, of this village 'with its woods\r\nand its pastures.' The men of the village might or might not maintain\r\nall their accustomed rights, but at any rate no expansion of those\r\nrights beyond the ancient usage was possible. The potentialities of the\r\nwaste (if we may so speak) had been handed over to a lord; the future\r\nwas his.\r\n\r\n[Free villages in England.]\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, repeat what has been lengthily said above touching\r\nthe growth of the manorial system, though we are painfully aware that we\r\nhave neglected many phases of the complicated process. Here let us\r\nremember that this process was not complete in the year 1066, and let us\r\nlook once more at the free villages in the east; for example, at\r\nOrwell[1187]. Who owned the land that served as a pasture for the\r\n_pecunia villae_? Shall we place the ownership in the thirteen holders\r\nof the arable strips into which the four hides were divided, or in a\r\ncorporation whereof they were the members, or in their various lords,\r\nthose eight exalted persons to whom they were commended, or shall we say\r\nthat here is _res nullius_? The supposition that the lords are owners of\r\nthe waste we may briefly dismiss. The landholders are free to 'withdraw\r\nthemselves' and seek other lords. That the land is _res nullius_ we may\r\nalso positively deny, if thereby be meant that it lies open to\r\noccupation. Let a man of the next village turn out his beasts there and\r\nhe will find out fast enough that he has done a wrong. But who will sue\r\nhim? Will all the villagers join as co-plaintiffs or will the village\r\ncorporation appear by its attorney? Far more in accordance with all that\r\nwe see in later days is it to suppose that any one of the men of Orwell\r\nwho has a right to turn out beasts can resent the invasion[1188]. This\r\nbrings to our notice the core of individualism that lies in the centre\r\nof the village. The houses and the arable strips are owned in severalty,\r\nand annexed to these houses and arable strips are pasture rights which\r\nare the rights of individuals and which, it may be believed, seem to\r\nexhaust the utility of the waste. What remains to dispute about? A nude,\r\na very nude _dominium_, which is often imperceptible.\r\n\r\n[The village meeting.]\r\n\r\nNot always imperceptible. From time to time these Orwell people in town\r\nmeeting assembled may have taken some grave resolution as to the\r\ntreatment of the waste. They may now and then have decided to add to the\r\namount of arable and diminish the amount of pasture. But occasional\r\nmeasures of this sort, for which a theoretical, if not a real, unanimity\r\nis secured, will not generate a regulative organ, still less a\r\nproprietary corporation. In decade after decade a township-moot at\r\nOrwell would have little to do. The moot of the Wetherley hundred is the\r\ncourt that deems dooms for the men of Orwell. If the lands of Orwell had\r\nbeen steadily regarded as the lands of a corporation they would have\r\npassed in one lump to some one Norman lord. But such corporate feeling\r\nas there was was weak. The men of Orwell had been seeking lords, each\r\nman for himself, in the most opposite quarters. Many of the virgates\r\nthat are physically in one village have, as we have seen[1189], been\r\nmade 'to lie in' other villages; for the free man can carry his land\r\nwhere he pleases. When this is so, he is already beginning to feel that\r\nthe tie which keeps him in a village community is a restraint that has,\r\nperhaps unfortunately, been imposed upon him and his property by ancient\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[What might have become of the free village.]\r\n\r\nThe fate of these lordless communities and of their waste was still\r\ntrembling in the balance when King Harold fell. To guess what would have\r\nhappened had he held his own is not easy. It is possible that what was\r\ndone by foreigners would have been done, though less rapidly, by lords\r\nof English race, and that by consolidating soke and commendation into a\r\nfirm landlordship and then making among themselves treaties of\r\npartition, they would have acquired the ownership of the pasture land\r\nsubject to the rights of common. It is perhaps more probable that in\r\nsome cases the old indeterminate state of things might have been\r\nmaintained until the idea of a fictitious personality had spread from\r\nthe chapter-house to the borough and from the borough to the village.\r\nThen the ownership of the soil might have been attributed to a\r\ncorporation of which the freeholders in the village were the members.\r\nOne famous case which came to light in the seventeenth century may warn\r\nus that throughout the middle ages there were here and there groups of\r\nfreeholders, and even of customary tenants, who were managing agrarian\r\naffairs in a manner which feudalism could not explain and our English\r\nlaw would not warrant, for they were behaving as though they were\r\nmembers of a landowning corporation[1190]. Often in the east of England\r\nthe manors must have been so intermixed that village meetings, not\r\nhowever of a democratic kind, may have dealt with business which lay\r\noutside the competence of any seignorial court. We know little and, it\r\nis to be feared, must be content to know little of such meetings. They\r\nwere not sessions of a tribunal; they kept no rolls; the law knew them\r\nnot. But we dare not say that if all seignorial pressure had been\r\nremoved, the village lands would have been preserved as communal lands\r\nfor modern villagers. Where there was no seignorial pressure, no joint\r\nand several liability for dues, the tie was lax between the owners of\r\nthe strips in the village fields; and if there was a corporate element\r\nin their union, there was also a strong element of co-ownership. Had\r\nthey been left to themselves, we can not say with any confidence that\r\nthey would not sooner or later have partitioned the waste. Was it not\r\ntheir land, and might they not do what they liked with their own?\r\n\r\n[Mark communities.]\r\n\r\nOne other question may be touched. It was the fashion in England some\r\nyears ago that those who spoke of village communities should say\r\nsomething of 'the Germanic mark.' What they said seemed often to imply\r\nthat the German village community was a mark community. This was a\r\nmistake. It seems indeed that there were parts of Germany in which the\r\nword 'mark' was loosely used[1191]; but the true _Markgenossenschaft_\r\nwas utterly different from the _Dorfgenossenschaft_, and the lands with\r\nwhich it dealt were just those lands that belonged to no village[1192].\r\nIn the country which saw the Germans becoming an agricultural race, the\r\nlands belonging to the villages were but oases in a wild territory. In\r\nlater days some large piece of this territory is found to be under the\r\ncontrol of a 'mark-community,' whose members are dwelling here and there\r\nin many different villages and exercise rights over the land (for the\r\nmore part it is forest land[1193]) that belongs to no village but\r\nconstitutes the mark. Traces of what might have become 'the mark system'\r\nmay perhaps be found in England; but not where they have been usually\r\nsought.\r\n\r\n[Intercommoning between vills.]\r\n\r\nWe read of a tract in Suffolk which is common pasture for the whole\r\nhundred of Coleness[1194]. Instances in which a piece of land is common\r\npasture for many vills were by no means uncommon in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. They grow rarer as time goes on. Our law provided but a\r\nprecarious and uncomfortable niche for them under the rubric _common pur\r\ncause de vicinage_[1195]. These are the traces of what in different\r\nsurroundings might have become, and perhaps were near to becoming, mark\r\ncommunities. In the thirteenth century the state seems to have been\r\nalready enforcing the theory that every inch of land ought to lie within\r\nthe territory of some vill[1196]. This was a police measure. The\r\nresponsibility of one set of villagers was not to cease until the\r\nboundary was reached where the responsibility of another set began. But\r\neven in recent times there have been larger moors in the north of\r\nEngland which 'belonged' (we will use a vague word) to two or more\r\ntownships in common. At any rate, we must not take back this theory that\r\nthe vills exhaust the land into the days of the Germanic\r\nsettlement[1197]. In some districts the vills must have been separated\r\nfrom each other by wide woods, and in all likelihood large portions of\r\nthese woods were not proper to any one village, but were regarded as\r\nbelonging, in some sense or another, to a group of villages. However,\r\nland of this kind was just the land which was most exposed to an\r\nassertion of royal ownership, and we imagine that a mark community had\r\nfrom the first little chance of organizing itself in England[1198]. But\r\nwe have already made too many guesses.\r\n\r\n[Last words.]\r\n\r\nWe must not be in a hurry to get to the beginning of the long history of\r\nlaw. Very slowly we are making our way towards it. The history of law\r\nmust be a history of ideas. It must represent, not merely what men have\r\ndone and said, but what men have thought in bygone ages. The task of\r\nreconstructing ancient ideas is hazardous, and can only be accomplished\r\nlittle by little. If we are in a hurry to get to the beginning we shall\r\nmiss the path. Against many kinds of anachronism we now guard ourselves.\r\nWe are careful of costume, of armour and architecture, of words and\r\nforms of speech. But it is far easier to be careful of these things than\r\nto prevent the intrusion of untimely ideas. In particular there lies a\r\nbesetting danger for us in the barbarian's use of a language which is\r\ntoo good for his thought. Mistakes then are easy, and when committed\r\nthey will be fatal and fundamental mistakes. If, for example, we\r\nintroduce the _persona ficta_ too soon, we shall be doing worse than if\r\nwe armed Hengest and Horsa with machine guns or pictured the Venerable\r\nBede correcting proofs for the press; we shall have built upon a\r\ncrumbling foundation. The most efficient method of protecting ourselves\r\nagainst such errors is that of reading our history backwards as well as\r\nforwards, of making sure of our middle ages before we talk about the\r\n'archaic,' of accustoming our eyes to the twilight before we go out into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1166] This seems to me the net outcome of the long and interesting\r\n         controversy which has divided the Germanists as to the\r\n         nature of the German _Genossenschaft_.\r\n\r\n  [1167] This is no extravagant hypothesis. See e.g. Stat. 7 Hen.\r\n         VIII. c. 1 Thacte advoidyng pullyng downe of townes.\r\n\r\n  [1168] See Army Act, 1881, 44 and 45 Vic. c. 58, sec. 115.\r\n\r\n  [1169] Flach, Les origines de l'ancienne France, ii. 45, referring\r\n         to the classical passages in Cæsar and Tacitus, says: 'Ce\r\n         serait un abus de mots de dire que la tribu ou que le clan\r\n         sont propriétaires. La tribu (_civitas_) a la souveraineté du\r\n         territoire, les clans de leurs subdivisions ont l'usage des\r\n         parts qui leur sont assignées. La conception même de la\r\n         propriété est exclue par la nature des terres: étendue de\r\n         friches toujours renaissantes et en surabondance toujours:\r\n         _superest ager_.' See also Dargun, Ursprung des Eigenthums,\r\n         Zeitschrift für vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft, v. 55.\r\n\r\n  [1170] Dargun, Ursprung des Eigenthums, Zeitschrift für\r\n         vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft, v. 1 (1884). See also\r\n         Hildebrand, Recht und Sitte, Jena, 1896.\r\n\r\n  [1171] In the A.-S. laws about tithes there is really no hint of\r\n         communalism. When a landowner has ploughed his tenth acre, he\r\n         is to assign that acre, or rather the crop that it will bear\r\n         next year, to the church. That is all; and though it may be a\r\n         rude plan, it is compatible with the most absolute\r\n         individualism. Mr Seebohm, Village Community, 114, however,\r\n         seems to think otherwise. As to the Welsh laws, we beg an\r\n         enormous question if we introduce them into this context. A\r\n         distribution of acres when the ploughing is done is just what\r\n         we do not see in England.\r\n\r\n  [1172] As to the famous words of Tacitus 'Agri pro numero cultorum\r\n         ab uniuersis in uices [_al._ inuicem] occupantur' and the\r\n         proposal to read _uniuersis vicis_, one of the best\r\n         suggestions yet made (Meitzen, Siedelung, iii. 586) is that\r\n         Tacitus wrote merely _ab uniuersis occupantur_, that a\r\n         copyist repeated the word _uniuersis_, and that other\r\n         copyists tried to make sense of nonsense.\r\n\r\n  [1173] As to the state of things represented by the Lex Salica see\r\n         Blumenstok, Entstehung des deutschen Immobiliareigenthums,\r\n         Innsbruck, 1894, pp. 196 ff.\r\n\r\n  [1174] Hist. Eng. Law, ii. 155. It may be convenient now-a-days to\r\n         say that _ownership_ implies a power of alienation. See\r\n         Pollock, Jurisprudence, 166. But to insist on this usage in\r\n         such discussions as that in which we are engaged would lead\r\n         to needless circumlocution. The question that is before us is\r\n         whether as a complaint to which a court of law will give\r\n         audience 'This acre is mine' is more modern than 'This acre\r\n         is ours.'\r\n\r\n  [1175] As to the whole of this matter see Meitzen, op. cit.,\r\n         especially iii. 574-589. As regards arable land in this\r\n         country the only 'survivals' which point to anything that\r\n         should be called communal ownership are singularly\r\n         inconclusive. They relate to small patches of arable land\r\n         held by burgesses: that is to say, they relate to places in\r\n         which a strong communal sentiment was developed during the\r\n         later middle ages, and they do not relate to communities that\r\n         ought to be called agricultural. The 'burgess plot' is not\r\n         large enough to have been any man's livelihood when\r\n         cultivated in medieval fashion, and it may well be modern. It\r\n         is demonstrable that in one case a very 'archaic' arrangement\r\n         was deliberately adopted in the nineteenth century by\r\n         burgesses who preferred 'allotment grounds' to pasture\r\n         rights.

A hypothetical practice of endogamy\r\n         will hardly give us the requisite explanation, for on the\r\n         whole the church seems to have encountered little difficulty\r\n         in imposing its extravagantly exogamous canons. To persuade\r\n         the converts not to marry their _affines_ was a much harder\r\n         task.\r\n\r\n  [1178] Heusler, Institutionen, 229.\r\n\r\n  [1179] As to the ownership of land by 'families,' see Hist.

This will serve as a good introduction to the large\r\n         literature which surrounds the _De migrantibus_.

But for the king's rights in\r\n         forest land, a 'mark community' might have grown up in\r\n         Epping. On the other hand, but for the king's rights, the\r\n         land might long ago have been partitioned among the\r\n         mark-men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ESSAY III.\r\n\r\n                             THE HIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What was the hide?]\r\n\r\nWhat was the hide? However unwilling we may be to face this dreary old\r\nquestion, we can not escape it. At first sight it may seem avoidable by\r\nthose who are interested in the general drift of national life, but have\r\nno desire to solve petty problems or face unnecessary difficulties. The\r\nhistory of weights and measures, some may say, is probably very curious\r\nand no doubt is worth study; but we, who shall be amply satisfied if we\r\nunderstand the grand movements and the broad traits, must leave this\r\nlittle province, as we must leave much else, to antiquarian specialists.\r\nUnfortunately, however, that question about the hide is 'pre-judicial'\r\nto all the great questions of early English history.\r\n\r\n[Importance of the question.]\r\n\r\nIf our choice lay between 30 and 40 acres, or again between a long and a\r\nshort hundred, then indeed we might refuse to take part in the conflict.\r\nBut between the advocates of big hides of 120 acres or thereabouts and\r\nthe advocates of little hides of 30 acres or thereabouts there should be\r\nno peace. In the construction of early English history we shall adopt\r\none style of architecture if we are supplied with small hides, while if\r\nour materials consist of big hides an entirely different 'plan and\r\nelevation' must be chosen. Let us take one example. We find the kings\r\ngiving away manses or hides by fives and tens. What are they really\r\ndoing? Are they or are they not giving away whole villages? Obviously\r\nthis question is pre-judicial to many another. Our whole conception of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon kingship will be profoundly affected by our attribution\r\nor our denial to the king of an alienable superiority over villages that\r\nare full of free landowners. This question, therefore, we should have\r\nupon our hands even if we thought that we could rear the fabric of\r\npolitical and constitutional history without first laying an economic\r\nfoundation. But the day for such castles in the air is passing.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, we must not talk in this pompous way of castles or foundations.\r\nWe are not going to lay foundations, nor even to choose a site. We hope\r\nto test a few materials and perhaps to show how a site may some day be\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n[Hide and manse in Bede.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Norman Conquest so far back as we can go, a certain possessory\r\nunit or a certain typical tenement is being thrust upon our notice by\r\nthe laws, the charters, the historians[1199]. We may begin with Bede.\r\nWhen he is going to speak of the area or the capacity of a tract of\r\nland, be it large or be it small, he refers to a certain unit or type,\r\nnamely, the land of one family (_terra unius familiae_). The abbess Hild\r\nacquires the land of one family and erects a religious house upon\r\nit[1200]; king Oswy gives away twelve tracts of land, each of which\r\nconsists of 'the _possessiones_ of ten families'[1201]; the kingdom of\r\nthe South Saxons contains the land of 7,000 families[1202]. We see that\r\nalready Bede is thinking rather of the size or capacity of a tract of\r\nsoil than of the number of households that happen to be dwelling there.\r\n'The measure (_mensura_) of the Isle of Wight is, according to the\r\nEnglish mode of reckoning, 1200 families[1203].' 'The isle of Thanet is\r\nno small island: that is to say, according to the customary English\r\ncomputation, it is of 600 families[1204].' Some apology is due from a\r\nscholar who writes in Latin and who writes thus; so Bede tells us that\r\nhe is using the English mode of reckoning; he is literally translating\r\nsome English term.\r\n\r\n[Hide and manse in the land-books.]\r\n\r\nWhen his own book is rendered into English that term will reappear.\r\nUsually it reappears in the form _híd_, but occasionally we have\r\n_hiwisc_ or _hiwscipe_. There seems no room for doubt that _hiwisc_ and\r\nthe more abstract _hiwscipe_ mean a household, and very little room for\r\ndoubt that _híd_ springs from a root that is common to it and them and\r\nhas the same primary meaning[1205]. Elsewhere we may find an equivalence\r\nbetween the hide and the _hiwisc_:--'If a Welsh man thrives so that he\r\nhas a _hiwisc_ of land and can render the king's gafol, then his wergild\r\nis 120 shillings; but if he attains only to a _half-hide_ then his\r\nwergild is 80 shillings[1206].' In the charters also we may now and then\r\nfind that the land to be conveyed is a _hiwisc_[1207], or is the land of\r\none _familia_[1208]. However, the common English term is _hide_, while\r\nthe scribes of the land-books, who as yet are above inventing a Latin\r\n_hida_, ring the changes on half-a-dozen phrases[1209]. We begin with\r\n_terra unius manentis_, _terra unius casati_, _terra unius tributarii_,\r\nwhich keep clearly before our eyes the fact or the theory that the\r\nnormal householder, the normal taxpayer, will possess one of these\r\nunits. At a little later time the more convenient _mansa_ (sometimes\r\n_mansio_[1210] or _mansiuncula_) becomes popular, and we may see also\r\nthat men are beginning to speak of manents, casates, tributaries 'of\r\nland,' much as they would speak of acres or perches of land[1211]. So\r\nfar as we can see, all these terms are being used as though they were\r\nabsolutely equivalent. If a clerk has to describe several different\r\ntenements, he will write of _manentes_ in one clause and _casati_ in the\r\nnext, merely because a repetition of the same term would be\r\ninelegant[1212]. In Kentish charters we read more of the _aratrum_ and\r\nthe _sullung_ than of the manse and the hide; but apparently we have\r\nhere other names for what is a similar and in some sort an equivalent\r\nunit[1213]; and it is by no means unknown that Kentish tenements will be\r\ncalled manses and hides[1214].\r\n\r\n[The large hide and the manorial arrangement.]\r\n\r\nNow if we ask whether the type to which reference is thus made is a\r\ntenement comprising about six-score acres of arable land, we are asking\r\na question of the gravest importance. For let us look at some of the\r\nconsequences which will flow from an affirmative answer. Let it be\r\ngranted that, long before the Norman Conquest, the hide has become an\r\nunit in an unwieldy system of taxation, which has been governed by false\r\nassumptions and vitiated by caprice, until the fiscal hide in a given\r\ncase may widely diverge from its original or indeed from any fixed type.\r\nNone the less, this system has for its base the theory that the typical\r\nman of Anglo-Saxon law, the typical householder or taxpayer, has a hide,\r\nhas land enough for a team of oxen, has 120 arable acres. The language\r\nof the charters supposes that this is so. No doubt the supposition is,\r\nas every supposition of this kind must be, untrue; but still it must\r\nhave a core of truth, and in the remotest age this core will be at its\r\nlargest. Men will not fall into a habit of speaking of 120 arable acres\r\nor thereabouts as the tenement of one family or of one householder,\r\nunless as a matter of fact the tenement of one family or of one\r\nhouseholder has in a preponderant number of cases some such content as\r\nthis. Suppose, for example, that the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the sixth\r\ncentury had been composed chiefly of lords, whose estates ranged from\r\n600 acres to some much larger quantity, and of 'semi-servile'\r\ncultivators, the average size of whose tenements was 30 acres, such a\r\nusage of words as that which we are considering could never have struck\r\nroot. Either the small tenement of the cultivator or the big tenement of\r\nhis lord must have been taken as the typical 'manse,' the typical 'land\r\nof one householder.' Let us at once press home this argument, though at\r\npresent it involves a hypothesis, for in the dull disquisitions that\r\nfollow we may be cheered by the thought that great questions are at\r\nstake. If in the oldest time the typical 'land of one householder' had\r\n120 arable acres, the manorial system was not prevalent, not dominant,\r\nin England. It will be admitted on all hands that this would be much too\r\nlarge a tenement for a serf or a semi-servile _colonus_. On the other\r\nhand, it is much too small a tenement for any one who is going to play\r\nthe part of a manorial lord, unless we use the term _manorial_ in so\r\nwide a sense that it becomes useless. For how many tenants will this\r\nmanorial lord, who is to be taken as the typical householder, have upon\r\nhis 120 acres? If his arrangements are at all like those revealed to us\r\nby Domesday Book, he will keep at least one-third of his land in\r\ndemesne, and there will remain but 80 acres for the _coloni_. Shall we\r\ngive him three _coloni_, or four or five? We can hardly give him a\r\nlarger number. Furthermore, it is quite clear that this 'manorial lord'\r\nwill not own a village. The villages as we see them in the earliest\r\ncharters and thence onward into Domesday Book contain five, ten, fifteen\r\nhides. Our manorial lord must be content to take his hide in little\r\nscraps scattered about among the scraps of some ten or twenty other\r\n'manorial lords' whose hides are similarly dispersed in the open field\r\nof a village. All this seems to follow inevitably if once we are\r\nsatisfied that the hide of the old days had 120 arable acres or\r\nthereabouts; for the hide is the land of one typical householder[1215].\r\n\r\n[Our course.]\r\n\r\nNow for a long time past there has been among historians and\r\nantiquaries a good deal of agreement in favour of this large hide, but\r\nagainst it appeal may be made to honoured names, such as those of Kemble\r\nand Eyton[1216]. Also it must be confessed that in favour of much\r\nsmaller hides, or at least of much smaller hides for the earliest days,\r\nsome weighty arguments may be advanced. In order that they may be\r\nunderstood, and perchance refuted, we must pursue a long and devious\r\ncourse and must raise by the way many questions, touching which we have\r\nno right to an opinion: questions about agriculture, questions about\r\nland measurement, perhaps even physiological questions. Also it is our\r\nmisfortune that, as we stumble through the night, we must needs stumble\r\nagainst some of our fellow adventurers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1199] The word _tenement_ will be often employed hereafter. Has it\r\n         become needful to protest that a _tenement_ need not be a\r\n         house? If my body is my soul's 'frail tenement,' that is not\r\n         because my body holds my soul (a reprobate error), but\r\n         because (for this is better philosophy and sound law) my\r\n         soul holds my body. But, to descend from these heights, it\r\n         will be a thousand pities if a vulgar blunder compels us to\r\n         abandon the excellent _tenement_ in favour of the feeble\r\n         _holding_ or the over-worked _estate_.\r\n\r\n  [1200] Hist.

By comparing this with\r\n         Ine 32 we get an even more explicit equation: 'Gif Wylisc mon\r\n         hæbbe hide londes' = 'Gif Wilisc mon geþeo þæt he hæbbe\r\n         hiwisc landes.'\r\n\r\n  [1207] K. 271 (ii. 52), a forgery: 'æt Cemele tien hyda, æt\r\n         Domeccesige þriddehalf hiwisce.'--K. 1077 (v. 146): 'æt\r\n         hilcan hiwisce feowerti penega.'--K. iii. 431: 'ðæs anes\r\n         hiwisces boc ... ðas oðres hiwisces.'--K. 1050 (v. 98). See\r\n         also Crawford Charters, 127, for _hiwscipe_.\r\n\r\n  [1208] K. 1006 (v. 47): 'de terra iuris mei aliquantulam portionem,\r\n         iuxta mensuram scilicet decem familiarum.' See also K. 1007.\r\n\r\n  [1209] The would-be Latin _hida_ occurs already in K. 230 (i. 297),\r\n         but is rare before the Conquest. On the other hand, as an\r\n         English word _híd_ is in constant use.\r\n\r\n  [1210] K. 131 (i. 159); K. 140 (i. 169).\r\n\r\n  [1211] Thus, to give one early example, K. 1008 (v. 49): 'duodecim\r\n         tributarios terrae quae appellantur Ferrinig.' So in K. 124\r\n         (i. 151) we have the neuter form _manentia_.\r\n\r\n  [1212] A good instance in Egbert's Dialogue, H. & S. iii. 404. For\r\n         how many hides may the clergy swear? A priest may swear\r\n         'secundum numerum 120 tributariorum'; a deacon 'iuxta numerum\r\n         60 manentium'; a monk 'secundum numerum 30 tributariorum.'\r\n         Here _tributarii_ alternates with _manentes_ for the same\r\n         reason that _secundum_ alternates with _iuxta_. So K. 143 (i.\r\n         173): '_manentes_ ... _casati_ ... _manentes_ ... _casati_.'\r\n\r\n  [1213] See Schmid, p. 611.\r\n\r\n  [1214] See, for instance, Werhard's testament (A.D. 832), K. 230 (i.\r\n         297): 'Otteford 100 hidas, Grauenea 32 hidas.' These are\r\n         Kentish estates. Hereafter we shall give some reasons for\r\n         thinking that the Kentish _sullung_ may have a history that\r\n         is all its own.\r\n\r\n  [1215] Mr Seebohm, Village Community, p. 395, admits that the\r\n         _familia_ of Bede and the _casatum_ of the charters is the\r\n         hide, and that the hide has 120 acres. This does not prevent\r\n         him from holding (p. 266) that when Bede speaks of king Oswy\r\n         giving to a church twelve _possessiunculae_, each of ten\r\n         families, we must see _decuriae_ of slaves, 'the bundle of\r\n         ten slaves or semi-servile tenants.' He seems also to think\r\n         that while the hide was 'the holding of the full free\r\n         landholder,' the _hiwisc_ was the holding of a servile\r\n         family. But the passage which he cites in a note (Wergilds, §\r\n         7) seems to disprove this, for there undoubtedly, as he\r\n         remarks, _hiwisc_=_hide_. It is the passage quoted above on\r\n         p. 359. The Welshman gets a wergild of 120 shillings\r\n         (three-fifths of an English ceorl's wergild) by acquiring a\r\n         _hiwisc_ or (Ine 32) _hide_ of land. Why the _hide_ should\r\n         not here mean what it admittedly means elsewhere is not\r\n         apparent.\r\n\r\n  [1216] Though Eyton has (for some reason that we can not find in his\r\n         published works) allowed but 48 'gheld acres' to the 'gheld\r\n         hide,' he can hardly be reckoned as an advocate of the Small\r\n         Hide. His doctrine, if we have caught it, is that the hide\r\n         has never been a measure of size. This raises the\r\n         question--How comes it then that the fractions into which a\r\n         hide breaks are indubitably called (gheld) 'acres'? Why not\r\n         ounces, pints, pence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Measures and Fields._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Permanence and change in agrarian history.]\r\n\r\nAt the present moment there is no need for arguments which insist upon\r\nthe immutable character of ancient agrarian arrangements. If we take up\r\na map of a common field drawn in the eighteenth century, the lines that\r\nwe see upon it are in the main very old. The scheme seems fashioned for\r\nthe purpose of resisting change and compelling the men of one age to\r\ntill the land as their fathers tilled it. Nothing but an unanimous\r\nagreement among those who are not likely to agree can break up that\r\nprison-house of cells in which agriculture has been cramped and\r\nconfined. Rather, it may be, the student who is perusing the 'estate\r\nmap' and who is fascinated by the possession of a new tool for picking\r\nhistorical locks, should warn himself that, though there has been\r\npermanence, there has also been change, and that in a far-off time\r\nchanges of a certain sort came quickly. True that in the current of\r\nagricultural progress there is a rapid acceleration as it flows towards\r\nour own day. We may easily go back to an age when the introduction of a\r\nnew process or new implement was rare. On the other hand, if we fix our\r\nattention on the map of any one village and contemplate its strips and\r\nbalks and virgates, the hazard involved in an assumption of their\r\nantiquity will increase swiftly when we have left behind us the advent\r\nof Duke William and are urging our inferential career towards Hengest\r\nor, it may be, towards Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[Rapidity of change in old times.]\r\n\r\nLet us look, for example, at the changes that take place in some Essex\r\nvillages during the twenty years that precede the Domesday Inquest. The\r\nfollowing table shows them:\r\n\r\n                          Villani  Bordarii   Servi  Lord's   Men's\r\n                                                      teams   teams\r\n\r\n    Teidana[1217],   T.

W.  26       55        0       3      15\r\n\r\nThese are but specimens of the obscure little revolutions that are being\r\naccomplished in the Essex villages. In general there has been a marked\r\nincrease in the number of _bordarii_, at the expense of the villeins on\r\nthe one part and the serfs on the other[1222], and this, whatever else\r\nit may represent, must tell us of a redistribution of tenements, perhaps\r\nof a process that substitutes the half-virgate for the virgate as the\r\naverage holding of an Essex peasant. The jar of conquest has made such\r\nrevolutions easy[1223].\r\n\r\n[Devastation of villages.]\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, though the 'bundles' of strips be cut in half, the\r\nmain features of the field remain constant. Let us, however, look at\r\nYorkshire, where for fifteen years an immense tract of land has been\r\nlying 'waste.' Have we any reason to believe that when agriculture\r\nslowly steals back into this desert there will be a mere restoration of\r\nthe defaced map? Surely not. If for a few years an 'open field' lies\r\nwaste, there will be no mere restoration. For one thing, many of the old\r\noutlines will have utterly vanished. Even if the acres were already\r\ndivided by the so-called 'balks' (and we can not be sure that they\r\nalways were[1224]), the balk was but a narrow strip of unploughed sward\r\nand would hardly be perceptible when the whole field was once more a\r\nsheet of grass and weeds. For another thing, new settlers would probably\r\nbegin by ploughing only a small portion of the old field. It is likely\r\nenough that their measuring rod would not be even approximately equal to\r\nthe rod employed in a previous century, and they would have ample\r\nopportunity for the introduction of novelties, for the substitution of\r\nthree fields for two and for all that such a change implies. Now\r\nWilliam's deliberate devastation of the north is but one final and\r\ngrandiose exploit of an ancient kind of warfare. After his day agrarian\r\nhistory becomes more stable because invasions cease and the character of\r\ncivil warfare changes. The strife between York and Lancaster, between\r\nKing and Parliament, passes like a thunderstorm over the fields; it\r\ndamages the crops; but that is all, and Bosworth 'Field' and Naseby\r\n'Field' will next year be tilled in the same old way. A raid of the\r\nDanes, a feud between Angle and Saxon, was a different affair. The\r\npeasants fought. Men, women and children were sold as slaves. Also there\r\nwas deliberate devastation. 'They make a wilderness and call it peace.'\r\nWhat else should they call it, when a foodless wilderness is the most\r\nscientific of all frontiers? Readers of the English Chronicle will doubt\r\nwhether there is any village in England that has not been once, or more\r\nthan once, a deserted village. And if we must reckon with war, there is\r\nfamine also to be reckoned with. When in a few brief words the English\r\nChronicler tells us that in 1043 there was mickle hunger in the land so\r\nthat the sestar of corn sold for sixty pence and even more[1225], he\r\nis, like enough, telling us of a disaster which depopulated many a\r\nvillage and forced many a villager to bow his head for meat in those\r\nevil days[1226]. Agrarian history becomes more catastrophic as we trace\r\nit backwards.\r\n\r\n[Village colonies.]\r\n\r\nAnd, putting on one side the ravages of war and famine, we must call to\r\nmind the numerous hints that our map gives us of village\r\ncolonization[1227]. Men did not make two contiguous villages at one time\r\nand call them both Hamton. Names are given to places in order that they\r\nmay be distinguished from neighbouring places. So when we see two\r\ndifferent villages, called Hamton and Other Hamton, lying next each\r\nother, we may be fairly certain that they are not of equal antiquity,\r\nand it is not unlikely that the one is the offshoot and daughter of the\r\nother[1228]. There are about one hundred and fifty Newtons and Newtowns\r\nin England. Every instance of colonization, every new settlement in the\r\nwoods, gave scope for the introduction of novelties, such scope as was\r\nnot to be found in after days when men stood thicker on the soil and all\r\nthe best land was already tilled[1229].\r\n\r\n[Antiquity of the three-field system.]\r\n\r\nTherefore we must not trust a method of husbandry or a scheme of\r\nland-measures much further than we can see it. Nothing, for example,\r\ncould be rasher than the assumption that the 'three-course system' of\r\ntillage was common in the England of the seventh century[1230]. We have\r\na little evidence that it was practised in the eleventh[1231], perhaps\r\nsome evidence, that it was not unknown in the ninth[1232]. But 'the\r\ntwo-course system' can be traced as far[1233], and seems to have been as\r\ncommon, if not commoner, in the thirteenth century[1234]. If on a modern\r\nmap we see a village with 'trinity fields,' we must not at once decide\r\nthat those who laid them out sowed two in every year, for it is well\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that two were left idle[1235]. An\r\nagriculture of this kind was not unknown in the Yorkshire of the\r\nfourteenth century[1236], and indeed we read that in the eighteenth 'one\r\ncrop and two fallows' was the traditional course in the open field of a\r\nSuffolk village[1237].\r\n\r\n[Differences between the different shires.]\r\n\r\nWe have time enough on our hands. Between Domesday Book and the\r\nwithdrawal of the legions lies as long an interval as that which\r\nseparates the Conqueror from Mr Arthur Young. Also we have space enough\r\non our hands. Any theory that would paint all England as plotted out for\r\nproprietary and agricultural purposes in accordance with a single\r\npattern would be of all theories the least probable. We need not\r\ncontrast Kent with Westmoreland, or Cornwall with Norfolk, for our maps\r\nseem to tell us that Somerset differed from Wiltshire and Dorset. The\r\nsettlement of a heathen folk loosely banded together under a war-lord\r\nwas one thing; the conquest of a new province by a Christian king who\r\nwas advised by foreign bishops and had already been taught that he had\r\nland to 'book,' would be another thing. If, as seems possible, we read\r\nin Ine's laws of a 'plantation' of some parts of Somerset effected by\r\nmeans of large allotments made to the king's gesiths, who undertake to\r\nput tillers on the soil[1238], we must not at once infer that this is an\r\nold procedure, for it may be very new, and may have for its outcome an\r\nagrarian arrangement strikingly unlike that which existed in the heart\r\nof the older Wessex.\r\n\r\n[New and old villages.]\r\n\r\nMoreover there are upon the face of our map many cases which seem to\r\ntell us that in the oldest days the smallest district that bore a name\r\nwas often large, and therefore that the territory which subserved a\r\nsingle group of homesteads was often spacious. One example we will take\r\nfrom Norfolk. We find a block of land that now-a-days consists of eleven\r\nparishes, namely, Wiggenhall St. Mary the Virgin, Wiggenhall St.\r\nGerman, Wiggenhall St. Peter, Wiggenhall St. Mary Magdalen, Tilney cum\r\nIslington, Tilney All Saints, Tilney St. Lawrence, Terrington St.\r\nClement, Terrington St. John, Walpole St. Peter, Walpole St.\r\nAndrew[1239]. In such a case we can hardly suppose that all these\r\nvillages belong to the same age, even if we are not entitled to infer\r\nthat the later villages were not founded until the day for parish\r\nchurches had arrived. This being so, it is highly probable that some\r\nvillages were formed at all stages of the feudalizing process, and\r\ntherefore that a historical account of 'the' English township, or even\r\nof 'the' English nucleated village, would of necessity be untrue. And,\r\nwhile this East Anglian specimen is still before us, we may notice\r\nanother interesting trait. In the Marshland Fen there is a considerable\r\ntract of ground which consists of 'detached portions' of these and other\r\nvillages. Each has been given a block there, a fairly rectangular block.\r\nAt one point the partition is minute. A space of less than 36 acres has\r\nbeen cut up so that no less than six villages shall have a piece, a\r\nrectangular piece of it[1240]. It seems very possible that this fen has\r\nat some time been common ground for all these villages, and, as already\r\nsaid, it is in this quarter that we may perhaps find traces of something\r\nthat resembled the 'marks' of Germany[1241]. The science of village\r\nmorphology is still very young, and we must not be led away into any\r\ndiscussion of its elements; but there is the more reason why we should\r\ntake to heart those warnings that it already gives us, because what we\r\ncan read of hides is to be found for the more part in documents\r\nproceeding from a central power, which, for governmental and fiscal\r\npurposes, endeavours to preserve fictitious continuity and uniformity in\r\nthe midst of change and variety. However, we must draw nearer to our\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n[History of measures.]\r\n\r\nAs regards land measurement, we may be fairly certain that in the days\r\nbefore the Norman Conquest there was little real, though much nominal\r\nuniformity. The only measures for the size of things with which nature\r\nhas equipped the natural man are his limbs. For the things that he\r\nhandles he uses his thumb, span, cubit, ell; for the ground upon which\r\nhe walks, his foot and his pace. For large spaces and long distances he\r\nmust have recourse to 'time-labour-units,' to the day's journey and the\r\nmorning's ploughing. Then gradually, under the fostering care of\r\ngovernment, steady equations are established between these\r\nunits:--twelve thumbs, for instance, are to make a foot. Thus the\r\nmeasures for land are brought into connexion with the more delicate\r\nmeasures used for cloth and similar stuff. Then an attempt to obtain\r\nsome standard less variable than the limb may forge a link between\r\nthumbs and grains of corn. Another device is the measuring rod. One rod\r\nwill represent the arm of an average man; a longer rod may serve to\r\nmediate between the foot which is short and the acre or day's ploughing\r\nwhich is large. In laying out a field in such wise that it shall consist\r\nof equal pieces, each of which can be ploughed in a forenoon, we\r\nnaturally use a rod. We say, for example, that to plough a strip that is\r\n4 rods wide and 40 long is a fair day's work. For some while there is\r\nno reason why the rods employed in two neighbouring villages should be\r\nstrictly or even approximately equal[1242]. Taxation is the great force\r\nthat makes for standard land measures. Then a king declares how many\r\nthumbs there ought to be in the cloth-ell or cloth-yard. At a later time\r\nhe actually makes cloth-ells or cloth-yards and distributes them,\r\nkeeping an ultimate standard in his own palace. Thenceforward all other\r\nunits tend to become mere fractions or multiples of this royal stick.\r\nThe foot is a third, the thumb or inch a thirty-sixth part thereof. Five\r\nand a half cloth-measuring yards make a royal land-measuring rod. Plot\r\nout a space which is four rods by forty, you will have an acre.\r\n\r\n[Slow growth of uniformity.]\r\n\r\nThe whole story, if ever it be told at length, will be intricate; but we\r\nbelieve that a general persuasion that land-measurements ought to be\r\nfixed by law and by reference to some one carefully preserved standard\r\nis much more modern than most people think. Real accuracy and the\r\nestablishment of a measure that is to be common to the whole realm first\r\nemerge in connexion with the measurement of cloth and such like. There\r\nis a delightful passage in the old Scotch laws which tells us that the\r\nell ought to contain 37 inches meted by the thumbs of three men, 'þat is\r\nto say, a mekill man and a man of messurabill statur and of a lytill\r\nman[1243].' We have somewhere read that in Germany, if a perch of\r\nfifteen feet was to be manufactured, the first fifteen people who\r\nchanced to come out of church contributed each a foot towards the\r\nconstruction of the standard. At an early time, however, men were trying\r\nto find some class of small things which were of a fairly invariable\r\nlength and hit upon barley-corns. This seems to have happened in England\r\nbefore the Norman Conquest[1244]. Instead of taking the 'thoume' of 'a\r\nman of messurabill statur' for your inch, you are to take three\r\nbarley-corns, 'iii bear cornys gud and chosyn but tayllis (i.e. without\r\nthe tails)'[1245]. But the twelfth century was drawing to an end before\r\nany decisive step was taken to secure uniformity even in the measurement\r\nof cloth. In Richard I.'s day guardians of weights and measures are to\r\nbe appointed in every county, city and borough; they are to keep iron\r\n_ulnae_[1246]. At this time or a little later these _ulnae_, ells or\r\ncloth-yards were being delivered out by a royal officer to all who might\r\nrequire them, and that officer had the custody of the ultimate\r\nstandards[1247]. We may doubt whether the laws which require in general\r\nterms that there shall be one measure throughout the realm had measures\r\nof land in view[1248]. A common standard is not nearly as necessary in\r\nthis case as it is in the case of cloth. Even in our own day men do not\r\nbuy land by the acre or the perch in the same sense as that in which\r\nthey buy cloth or cotton by the yard. Very rarely will anyone name a\r\nprice for a rood and leave it to the other bargainer to decide which out\r\nof many roods shall be included in the sale. Nevertheless, the\r\ndistribution of iron _ulnae_ was important. An equation was established\r\nbetween the cloth measure and the land measure: five-and-a-half _ulnae_\r\nor cloth-yards make one royal perch. After this we soon find that land\r\nis occasionally measured by the iron _ulna_ of the king[1249].\r\n\r\n[Superficial measure.]\r\n\r\nThe scheme of computation that we know as 'superficial measure' was long\r\nin making itself part of the mental furniture of the ordinary man. Such\r\nterms as 'square rod' and 'square mile' were not current, nor such\r\nequations as that which tells us how 144 square inches make a square\r\nfoot. Whatever may have been the attainments of some cloistered\r\nmathematicians, the man of business did not suppose that he could talk\r\nof size without talking of shape, and indeed a set of terms which speak\r\nof shapeless size is not very useful until men have enough of geometry\r\nand trigonometry to measure spaces that are not rectangular\r\nparallelograms. The enlightened people of the thirteenth century can say\r\nthat if an acre is _x_ perches long it is _y_ perches wide[1250]. They\r\ncan compare the size of spaces if all the lines be straight and all the\r\nangles right; and for them an acre is no longer of necessity ten times\r\nas long as it is broad. But they will not tell us (and they do not\r\nthink) that an acre contains _z_ 'square perches.' This is of some\r\nimportance to students of Domesday Book. Very often the size of a tract\r\nof land is indicated by the length of two lines:--The wood or the\r\npasture is _x_ leagues (furlongs, perches, feet) in length and _y_ in\r\nbreadth. Now, to say the least, we are hasty if we treat this as a\r\nstatement which gives us size without shape. It is not all one to say\r\nthat a wood is a league long and a league wide and to say that it is two\r\nleagues long and half a league wide. The jurors are not speaking of\r\nsuperficial content, they are speaking of length and breadth, and they\r\nare either giving us the extreme diameters of the irregularly shaped\r\nwoods and pastures, or (and this seems more probable) they are making\r\nrough estimates of mean diameters. If we go back to an earlier time, the\r\nless we think of 'superficial measure' the better[1251].\r\n\r\n[The modern system.]\r\n\r\nLet us recall the main features of our modern system, giving them the\r\nnames that they bore in medieval Latin.\r\n\r\n                           _Linear Measure._\r\n\r\n     12 inches (_pollices_)=1 foot (_pes_); 3 feet=1 yard (_ulna_); 5·5\r\n     yards=1 rod, pole, perch (_virga_, _pertica_, _perca_); 40\r\n     perches=1 furlong (_quarentina_); 8 furlongs=1 mile (_mille_); 12\r\n     furlongs=1 _leuua_, _leuca_, _leuga_ (league)[1252].\r\n\r\n                          _Superficial Measure._\r\n\r\n     144 square inches=1 square foot; 9 square feet=1 square yard; 30·25\r\n     square yards=1 square perch; 40 square perches=1 rood; 4 roods=1\r\n     acre[1253].\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century these outlines are already drawn; but, as we\r\nhave seen, if we are to breathe the spirit of the time, we ought to say\r\n(while admitting that acres may be variously shaped) that the normal\r\nacre is 4 perches in width and 40 perches (=1 furlong) in length. The\r\nonly other space that we need consider is the quarter of an acre, our\r\nrood. That ought to be 1 perch in width and 1 furlong (=40 perches) in\r\nlength. The breadth of the acre is still known to all Englishmen, for it\r\nis the distance between the wickets.\r\n\r\n[The ancient elements of land measure.]\r\n\r\nThis system has been generated by the corelation of cloth-measures and\r\nland-measures. If we are going back to remote times, we must expel the\r\ncloth-measures as intruders. What then is left is very simple; it is\r\nthis:--the human foot, a day's ploughing and a measuring stick which\r\nmediates between feet and acres. That stick has had many names. Our\r\narithmetic books preserve three, 'rod, pole or perch'; it has also been\r\nknown as a _gād_ or _goad_ and a _lug_: but probably its oldest name\r\nis _yard_ (_gyrd_). It is of some importance that we should perceive\r\nthat our modern yard of three feet is not one of the very ancient\r\nland-measures. It is a 'cloth-yard' not a land-yard. In medieval\r\ndocuments the Latin name for it is _ulna_[1254], and probably the oldest\r\nEnglish name for it is _eln_, _elle_, _ell_. There seems to have been a\r\nshifting of names. The measuring rod that was used for land had so many\r\nnames, such as _perch_, _rod_, _pole_, _goad_, _lug_, that it could\r\nafford, if we may so speak, to dispense with the additional name of\r\n_yard_, which therefore might stand for the much shorter rod that was\r\nused by the clothiers. However, even in our own century men have been\r\nspeaking of 'yards of land' in a manner which implies that at one time a\r\nyard, when mentioned in this context, was the same thing as the perch.\r\nWhen they have spoken of a 'yard of land' they have meant sometimes a\r\nquarter of an acre (our rood) and sometimes a much larger space. In 1820\r\na 'yard of land' means, we are told, a quarter of an acre in Wiltshire,\r\nwhile in Buckinghamshire it stands for a tract which varies from 28 to\r\n40 acres[1255]. This last application of the term we shall consider by\r\nand by. A yard of land or rood of land (_rood_ and _rod_ are all one) is\r\na quarter of an acre, because an acre is four rods or 'yards' or perches\r\nin width, and, when an acre is to be divided, it is always, and for a\r\nvery good reason, divided by lines parallel to its long sides. So though\r\nthe rood or yard of land may in course of time take other shapes and\r\neven become a shapeless size, it ought to be a rod or 'yard' in width\r\nand forty rods or one furlong in length.\r\n\r\n[The German acre.]\r\n\r\nSo we start with the human foot, the day's ploughing and a rod. How much\r\nborrowing there has been in this matter by race from race is an obscure\r\nquestion. For example, the mediation of a rod between the foot and the\r\nday's work is common to the Roman and the Germanic systems. Here the\r\nsimilarity ends, and the vast differences which begin seem to have\r\nexceedingly deep roots. We can not be content with saying that the Roman\r\nputs two oxen in the plough and therefore draws short furrows, whereas\r\nthe German puts eight oxen and draws long furrows. There seems to be a\r\nradical disagreement between them as to what a plough should be and what\r\na plough should do[1256]. To these matters we can make but the slightest\r\nreference, nor dare we touch the problems of Celtic history. Somehow or\r\nanother the Germans come to the rule that generally an acre or day's\r\nwork should be four rods wide and, if possible, about forty rods\r\nlong[1257].\r\n\r\n[English acres.]\r\n\r\n[Small acres.]\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that in England this rule prevailed at a remote\r\ntime. Throughout the middle ages and on to our own day there have been\r\nmany 'acres' in England which swerved markedly from what had become the\r\nstatutory type, and in some cases a pattern divergent from the statutory\r\npattern became 'customary' in a district. But apparently these customary\r\nacres commonly agree with the royal standard in involving the equation:\r\n1 acre = 4 perches x 40 perches[1258]. In Domesday Book and thence\r\nonwards the common Latin for _furlong_ is _quarentina_, and this tells\r\nus of furrows that are forty perches long. It is when we ask for the\r\nnumber of feet in a perch that we begin to get various answers, and very\r\nvarious they are. The statutory number, the ugly 16·5, looks like a\r\ncompromise[1259] between 15 and 18, both of which numbers seem to have\r\nbeen common in England and elsewhere. This is the royal equation in the\r\nthirteenth century; it has been found near the middle of the\r\ntwelfth[1260]; more at present we cannot say. Short perches and small\r\nacres have been very common in the south of England. In 1820 some\r\ninformation about the customary acre was collected[1261]:--In\r\nBedfordshire it was 'sometimes 2 roods.' In Dorsetshire 'generally 134\r\n[instead of 160] perches.' In Hampshire, 'from 107 to 120 perches, but\r\nsometimes 180,' In Herefordshire, 'two-thirds of a statute acre,' but\r\n'of wood, an acre and three-fifths or 256 perches.' In Worcestershire,\r\n'sometimes 132 or 141 perches.' In Sussex, '107, 110, 120, 130 or 212\r\nperches'; '_short acre_, 100 or 120 perches'; '_forest acre_, 180\r\nperches,' Then as to rods, the 'lug or goad' of Dorsetshire had 15 ft. 1\r\nin.; in Hertfordshire, 20 feet; in Wiltshire, 15 or 16-1/2 or 18. The\r\nwide prevalence of rods of 15 feet can not be doubted, and it seems\r\npossible that rods with as few as 12 feet have been in use[1262]. An\r\nacre raised from a 12 foot rod would, if feet were invariable, be little\r\nmore than half our modern statute acre. Nowhere do we see any sure trace\r\nof a rod so short as the Roman _pertica_ of ten _pedes_, though the\r\nscribes of the land-books will give the name _pertica_ to the English\r\n_gyrd_[1263].\r\n\r\n[Large acres.]\r\n\r\nIn northern districts the 'customary' acre grows larger. In Lincolnshire\r\nit is said to be '5 roods, particularly for copyhold land'; but small\r\nacres were known there also[1264]. In Staffordshire, 'nearly 2-1/4\r\nacres.' In Cheshire, 'formerly and still in some places 10,240 square\r\nyards' (pointing to a rod of 24 feet). In Westmoreland, '6760 square\r\nyards' (pointing to a rod of 19-1/2 feet), also the so-called 'Irish\r\nacre' of 7840 square yards (pointing to a rod of 21 feet). There is much\r\nevidence that rods of 20 and 21 feet were often used in Yorkshire and\r\nDerbyshire. Rods of 18, 19-1/2, 21, 22-1/2 and 24 feet were known in\r\nLancashire. A writer of the thirteenth century speaks as if rods of 16,\r\n18, 20, 22 and 24 feet were in common use, and mentions none\r\nshorter[1265]. As just said, the Irish plantation acre was founded on a\r\nrod of 21 feet. The Scotch acre also is larger than the English; it\r\nwould contain about 6150·4 instead of 4840 of our square yards; it is\r\nformed from a rod of 6 Scotch ells. On the other hand, the acres which\r\nhave prevailed in Wales seem to be small; one type had 4320 of our\r\nsquare yards, another 3240.\r\n\r\n[Anglo-Saxon rods and acres.]\r\n\r\nThere has been variety enough. Even if the limits of variation are given\r\nby rods of 12 and 24 feet, this will enable one acre to be four times as\r\nlarge as another. Whether before the twelfth century there was anything\r\nthat we ought to call a standard rod, a royal rod for all England, must\r\nbe very doubtful. In royal and other land-books references are made to\r\nfurlongs, to acre-breadths, to yards or rods or perches, and to feet as\r\nto known measures of length[1266], but whether a kingly gift is always\r\nmeasured by a kingly rod we do not know. The Carolingian emperors\r\nendeavoured to impose a rod upon their dominions; it seems to have been\r\nconsiderably shorter than our statute perch[1267]. In this province we\r\nneed not expect many Norman novelties. We see from Domesday Book that\r\nthe Frenchmen introduced the ancient Gallic _arpentum_[1268] as a\r\nmeasure for vineyards[1269]; but most of the vines were of their own\r\nplanting, and the mere fact that they used this measure only for the\r\nvineyards seems to tell us that they were content with English rods and\r\nEnglish acres[1270]. In Normandy the perches seem to have ranged upwards\r\nfrom 16 to 25 feet[1271]; so that 16·5 would not have hit the average.\r\nOn the whole, our perch seems to speak of a king whose interests and\r\nestates lay in southern England and who struck a mean between 15 and 18.\r\nWhoever he was, we owe him no thanks for the 'undecimal' element that\r\ntaints our system[1272].\r\n\r\n[Customary acres and forest acres.]\r\n\r\nBut we must be cautious in drawing inferences from loose reports about\r\n'customary' measures. Village maps and village fields have yet to be\r\nseriously studied. We may in the meanwhile doubt whether in some\r\ndistricts to which the largest acres are ascribed, such acres are normal\r\nor are drawn in the oldest villages. We may suspect them of being\r\n'forest acres.' If once a good many of these abnormal units are\r\ndistributed in a district, they will by their very peculiarity attract\r\nmore than their fair share of attention and will be spoken of as\r\ncharacteristic of that district. In Germany, as well as in England, we\r\nfind forest acres which are much larger than common acres and are meted\r\nby a rod which is longer than the common rod[1273]. Possibly men have\r\nfound a long rod convenient when they have large spaces to measure, but\r\nwe fancy that the true explanation would illustrate the influence\r\nexercised by taxation on systems of measurement. Some scheme of\r\nallotment or colonization is being framed; an equal tribute is to be\r\nreserved from the allotted acres. If, however, there is uncleared\r\nwoodland to be distributed, rude equity, instead of changing the tribute\r\non the acre, changes the acre's size and uses a long rod for land that\r\ncan not at once be tilled[1274]. Also fields that were plotted out by\r\nNormans were likely to have large acres, and as the perches of Normandy\r\nseem to have been longer than most of the perches that were used in\r\nFrance, we may perhaps infer that the Scandinavian rods were long and\r\nfind in them an explanation of the big acres of northern England. But at\r\npresent such inferences would be precarious.\r\n\r\n[The acre and the day's work.]\r\n\r\nWhether in its origin the land-measuring rod is a mere representative of\r\na certain number of feet or is some instrument useful for other purposes\r\nseems to be dubious. One of the names that it has borne in English is\r\n_goad_; but most of our rods would be extravagantly long goads[1275].\r\nPossibly the width of four oxen yoked abreast has exercised some\r\ninfluence upon its length[1276]. When a rod had once found acceptance,\r\nit must speedily have begun to convert that 'time-labour-unit,' the\r\nacre, into a measured space. Already in the land-books we read of acres\r\nof meadow[1277]; this is no longer a contradiction in terms. Still there\r\ncan be no doubt that our acre, like the _jurnale_, _Tagwerk_, _Morgen_\r\nof the Continent, has at its root the tract that can be ploughed in a\r\nday, or in a forenoon:--in the afternoon the oxen must go to the\r\npasture[1278]. Now, when compared with their foreign cousins, our\r\nstatute perch is a long rod and our statute acre is a decidedly large\r\n'day-work-unit[1279].' It seems to tell of plentiful land, sparse\r\npopulation and poor husbandry. This is of some importance. There is a\r\ngood deal of evidence pointing to the conclusion that, whereas in the\r\noldest days men really ploughed an acre in a forenoon, the current of\r\nagricultural progress made for a while towards the diminution of the\r\nspace that was covered by a day's labour. In Ælfric's dialogue the\r\nploughman complains that each day he must till 'a full acre or\r\nmore[1280].' His successor, the poetic Piers, had only a half-acre to\r\nplough[1281]. In monastic cartularies which come from southern counties,\r\nwhere we have no reason to suspect exceptionally large acres, the\r\nvillein seems often to plough less than an acre[1282]. Then that\r\nenlightened agriculturist, Walter of Henley, enters upon a long argument\r\nto prove to his readers that you really can plough seven-eighths of an\r\nacre in a forenoon, and even a whole acre if you are but engaged in that\r\nlight kind of ploughing which does for a second fallowing[1283]. Five\r\ncenturies later another enlightened agriculturist, Arthur Young,\r\ndiscovered that 'from North Leach, through Gloucestershire,\r\nMonmouthshire, and Glamorganshire, light and middling turnip-land etc.'\r\nwas being ploughed at the rate of half an acre to one acre a day by\r\nteams of 'eight oxen; never less than six; or four and two horses.'\r\nThis, he says, was being done 'merely in compliance with the obstinacy\r\nof the low people,' for 'the labourers will not touch a plough without\r\nthe usual number of beasts in it[1284]'. Mr Young could not tell us of\r\n'these vile remnants of barbarity without a great degree of\r\ndisgust[1285]'. But we are grateful. We see that an acre of light land\r\nwas the maximum that these 'low people' with their eight oxen would\r\nplough in a day, and we take it that at one time the voice of reforming\r\nscience had urged men to diminish the area ploughed in a given time, to\r\nplough deeper and to draw their furrows closer. The old tradition was\r\nprobably well content with a furrow for every foot. Walter of Henley\r\nproposed to put six additional furrows into the acre[1286]. Hereafter we\r\nshall see that some of the statistics given by Domesday Book fall in\r\nwith the suggestion that we are here making. Also we may see on our maps\r\nthat the strip which a man has in one place is very often not an acre\r\nbut a half-acre. Now, in days when men really ploughed an acre at a\r\nstretch, such an arrangement would have involved a waste of time, since,\r\nwhen the morning's work was half done, the plough would be removed from\r\none 'shot' to another[1287].\r\n\r\n[The real acres in the fields.]\r\n\r\nAt length we reach the fields, and at once we learn that there is\r\nsomething unreal in all our talk of acre and half-acre strips. In\r\npassing we may observe that some of our English meadows which show by\r\ntheir 'beds' that they were not always meadows, seem to show also that\r\nthe boundaries of the strips were not drawn by straight rods, but were\r\ndrawn by the plough. The beds are not straight, but slightly sinuous,\r\nand such, it is said, is the natural course of the old plough; it\r\nswerves to the left, and this tendency is then corrected by those who\r\nguide it[1288]. But, apart from this, land refuses to be cut into\r\nparallelograms each of which is 40 rods long and 4 wide. In other words,\r\nthe 'real acres' in an open field diverge widely from the ideal acre\r\nthat was in the minds of those who made them.\r\n\r\n[The 'shots.']\r\n\r\nLet us recall a few features of the common field, though they will be\r\nfamiliar to all who have read Mr Seebohm's book[1289]. A natural limit\r\nto the length of the furrow is set by the endurance of oxen. From this\r\nit follows that even if the surface that lies open is perfectly level\r\nand practically limitless, it will none the less be broken up into what\r\nour Latin documents call _culturae_[1290]. The _cultura_ is a set of\r\ncontiguous and parallel acre-strips; it tends to be a rude\r\nparallelogram; two of its sides will be each a furlong ('furrowlong') in\r\nlength, while the length of the other sides will vary from case to case.\r\nWe commonly find that every great field (_campus_) is divided into\r\ndivers _culturae_, each of which has its own name. The commonest English\r\nequivalent for the word _cultura_ seems to have been _furlong_, and this\r\nuse of _furlong_ was very natural; but, as we require that term for\r\nanother purpose, we will call the _cultura_ a _shot_. So large were the\r\nfields, that the annual value of an acre in one shot would sometimes be\r\neight times greater than that of an acre in another shot[1291]. To such\r\ndifferences our ancestors were keenly alive. Hence the dispersion of the\r\nstrips which constitute a single tenement.\r\n\r\n[Delimitation of shots.]\r\n\r\nBut to make 'shots' which should be rectangular and just 40 feet long\r\nwas often impossible. Even if the surface of the field were flat, its\r\nboundaries were the irregular curves drawn by streams and mounds. In\r\norder to economize space, shots running at right angles to other shots\r\nwere introduced, and of necessity some furlongs were longer than others.\r\nIf, however, as was often the case, men were laying out their fields\r\namong the folds of the hills, their acres would be yet more irregular\r\nboth in size and in shape. They would be compelled to make very small\r\nshots, and the various furrows if 'produced' (in the geometer's sense of\r\nthat word) would cut each other at all imaginable angles. On the maps we\r\nmay still see them struggling with these difficulties, drawing as many\r\nrectilinear shots as may be and then compelled to parcel out as best\r\nthey can the irregularly shaped patches that remain. And then we see\r\nthat even these patches have been allotted either as acres or as\r\nhalf-acres.\r\n\r\n[The real and the ideal acre.]\r\n\r\nTherefore, when we are dealing with medieval documents, we have always\r\nto remember that besides ideal acres there were real acres which were\r\nmapped out on the surface of the earth, and that a plot will be, and\r\nrightly may be, called an acre though its size is not that of any ideal\r\nacre. To tell a man that one of these acre-strips was not an acre\r\nbecause it was too small would at one time have been like telling him\r\nthat his foot was no foot because it fell short of twelve inches. This\r\npoint is made very plain by some of the beautiful estate maps edited by\r\nMr Mowat[1292]. We have a map of 'the village of Whitehill in the\r\nparishe of Tackley in the countye Oxon., the moitye or one halfe whereof\r\nbelongeth to the presidente and schollers of Corpus christi colledge in\r\nthe universitye of Oxon., the other moitye unto Edwarde Standerd yeoman\r\nthe particulars whereof soe far as knowne doe plainelye appeare in the\r\nplatte and those which are unknowne, as wastes comons and lotte meadowes\r\nare equallye divided betweene them, drawne in November anno domini 1605,\r\nregni regis Iacobi iijº.' We see four great fields divided first into\r\nshots and then into strips. Each strip on the map bears an inscription\r\nassigning it either to the college or to Mr Standerd, and with great\r\nregularity the strips are assigned to the college and to Standerd\r\nalternately. Then on each strip is set its 'estimated' content, and on\r\neach strip of the college land is also set its true content. Thus\r\nlooking at one particular shot in the South Field we read:\r\n\r\n               ij. ac. coll. 1. 1. 36\r\n               Edw. Stand. ij. ac.\r\n               ij. ac. coll. 1. 2. 2\r\n               Edw. Stand. ij. ac.\r\n               ij. ac. coll. 1. 2. 2\r\n               Edw. Stand. ij. ac.\r\n               ij. ac. coll. 1. 0. 39.\r\n\r\nThis means that, going along this shot, we first come to a\r\ntwo-acre-strip of college land containing by admeasurement 1 A. 1 R. 36\r\nP.; next to a two-acre strip of Standerd's land, which the surveyor, who\r\nwas making the map for the college, was not at pains to measure; then to\r\na two-acre strip of college land containing 1 A. 2 R. 2 P.:--and so\r\nforth. Then in the margin of the map has been set 'A note of the\r\ncontentes of the landes in Whitehille belonginge to the colledge.' It\r\ntells us how 'theire groundes in the West Fielde by estimation 80 acres\r\ndoe conteine by statute measure 48 A. 2 R. 24 P.' The other fields we\r\nmay deal with in a table\r\n\r\n                                 A.            A.  R.  P.\r\n     East Field     estimation   75   measure  51   1  25\r\n     Middle Field                58            39   3  36\r\n     South Field                103            59   2  13\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that the discrepancy between the two sets of\r\nfigures is not to be fully explained by the supposition that at\r\nWhitehill men had measured land by measures differing from our statutory\r\nstandards[1293]. The size of a 'two-acres' (and the land in this\r\ninstance had been divided chiefly into 'two-acres') varied not only from\r\nfield to field and shot to shot, but within one and the same shot. Each\r\ntwo-acre strip has an equal breadth, but the curving boundaries of the\r\nfields make some strips longer than others[1294].\r\n\r\n[Varying size of the acres.]\r\n\r\nWe turn to the admirable maps of Heyford in Oxfordshire designed in\r\n1606. Here the land is divided among many occupiers and cut up into a\r\nvast number of strips, to each of which is assigned its 'estimated' and\r\nits measured content. Thus we read:--\r\n\r\n               dim. ac. Jo. Sheres 1. 18\r\n               dim. ac. Ric. Elkins 1. 18\r\n               dim. ac. Jo. Merry 1. 18.\r\n\r\nIn this part of this shot a 'half-acre' contains 1 R. 18 P. Some of the\r\nshots in this village have fairly straight and rectangular boundaries,\r\nso that we may, for example, find that many successive 'half-acres'\r\ncontain 1 R. 18 P. But then if we pass to the next shot we shall find 1\r\nR. 28 P. in the 'half-acre,' while in a third shot we shall find but 1\r\nR. 8 P. Yet every strip of land is a 'half-acre' or an 'acre' or a 'acre\r\nand a half' or a 'two acres' or a 'three acres.' We see further that\r\nwhen 'acres' occur among 'half-acres' the strips vary in breadth but not\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nOn a map of Roxton made in 1768 we have the same thing written out in\r\nEnglish words. Thus:--\r\n\r\n               Eliz. Gardner a half   0. 1. 32\r\n               Carpenter a half       0. 1. 32\r\n               Harris an acre         0. 3. 24\r\n               Carpenter a half       0. 1. 32\r\n               Jam. Gardner an acre   0. 3. 24\r\n               Makepace a half        0. 1. 34\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is that anyone who lives in a village knows how\r\nmany 'acres' its fields contain. He has not to measure anything; he has\r\nonly to count strips, for he is not likely to confuse 'acres' with\r\n'half-acres' and that is the only mistake that he could make.\r\n\r\n[Irregular length of acres.]\r\n\r\nIf a shot had a curved boundary, little or no pains seem to have been\r\ntaken to equalize the strips that lay within it by making additional\r\nwidth serve as a compensation for deficient length. The width of the\r\nso-called acre remained approximately constant while its length varied.\r\nThus, to take an example from the map of Heyford, we see a shot which is\r\nbounded on the one side by a straight line and on the other by a curving\r\nroad. At one end of it the acre contains 2 R. 8 P.; this increases to 2\r\nR. 30 P.; then slowly decreases until it has fallen as low as 1 R. 36\r\nP., and then again rises to 2 R. 2 P. When they were dividing the field,\r\nmen attempted to map out shots in which approximately equal areas could\r\nbe constructed; but, when a shot was once delimited, then all the acres\r\nin it were made equally broad, while their length could not but vary,\r\nexcept in the rare case in which the shot was a true rectangle[1295].\r\n\r\n[The selions or beds.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the whole system was made yet more visible by the\r\npractice of ploughing the land into 'beds' or ridges, which has but\r\nrecently fallen out of use. In our Latin documents these ridges appear\r\nas selions (_seliones_). In English they were called 'lands,' for the\r\nFrench _sillon_ struck no root in our language. Anyone who has walked\r\nthrough English grass fields will know what they looked like, for they\r\ntriumph over time and change[1296]. Now it would seem that a fairly\r\ncommon usage made four selions in each acre[1297]; in other words, each\r\nacre-strip was divided longitudinally into four waves, so that the\r\ndistance from crest to crest or trough to trough was a perch in length.\r\nWhere this usage obtained, you could tell how many acres a shot or field\r\ncontained by merely observing the undulations of the surface. Even if,\r\nas was often the case, the number of selions in the acre was not four,\r\nstill the number that went to an acre of a given shot would be known,\r\nand a man might argue that a strip was an acre because in crossing it he\r\ntraversed three or six terrestrial waves[1298].\r\n\r\n[Acres divided lengthwise.]\r\n\r\nIf we look at old maps, we soon see that when an acre was divided, it\r\nwas always divided by a line that was parallel, not to its short ends,\r\nbut to its long sides. No one would think of dividing it in any other\r\nfashion. Suppose that you bisected it by bisecting its long sides, you\r\nwould force each owner of a half-acre to turn his plough as often as if\r\nhe had a whole acre. Besides, you would have uneconomical furrows; the\r\noxen would be stopped before they had traversed what was regarded as the\r\nnatural distance for beasts to go. Divide your acre into two long\r\nstrips, then your folk and beasts can plough in the good old way. Hence\r\nit follows that when men think of dividing an acre they speak only of\r\nits breadth. Hence it follows that the quarter of an acre is a 'rood' or\r\n'yard[1299]' or _virga_ or _virgata_ of land. Its width is a rod or\r\nland-yard, and its length--but there is no need to speak of its\r\nlength[1300].\r\n\r\n[The virgate.]\r\n\r\nHow then does it happen that these terms 'virgate' and 'yard of land,'\r\nthough given to a quarter of an acre, are yet more commonly given to a\r\nmuch larger quantity containing 30 acres or thereabouts? The explanation\r\nis simple. The typical tenement is a hide. If you give a man a quarter\r\nof a hide (an equitable quarter, equal in value as well as extent to\r\nevery remaining quarter) you do this by giving him a quarter of every\r\nacre in the hide. You give him a rood, a yard, a _virga_[1301], a\r\n_virgata_ in every acre, and therefore a rood, a yard, a _virga_, a\r\n_virgata_ of a typical tenement[1302].\r\n\r\n[The double meaning of a yard.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is clumsy to have only one term for two quantities, one of\r\nwhich is perhaps a hundred-and-twenty times as great as the other; but\r\nthe context will tell us which is meant, and the difference between the\r\ntwo is so large that blunders will be impossible. In course of time\r\nthere will be a differentiation and specification of terms. To our ears,\r\nfor example, _rōd_ (_rood_) will mean one thing, _rŏd_ another,\r\n_yard_ a third; but even in the nineteenth century royal commissioners\r\nwill report that a 'yard of land' may mean a quarter of an acre or 'from\r\n28 to 40 acres[1303].' When men have not apprehended 'superficial\r\nmeasure' (the measurement of shapeless size), when their only units are\r\nthe human foot, a rod, an average day's work and the tenement of a\r\ntypical householder, their language will be poor, because their thought\r\nis poor.\r\n\r\n[The yard-land a fraction of a hide.]\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at a not insignificant truth. The virgate or\r\nyard-land of 30 acres or thereabouts is not a primary unit like the\r\nhide, the rod, the acre. It is derivative; it is compound. In its origin\r\nit is a rod's breadth in every acre of a hide. In course of time in this\r\ncase, as in other cases, size will triumph over shape. The acre need not\r\nbe ten times as long as it is broad; the virgate need not be composed,\r\nperhaps is rarely composed, of scattered quarter-acres; quartering acres\r\nis an uneconomical process; it leads to waste of time. But still the\r\nterm will carry on its face the traces of an ancient history and a\r\nprotest against some modern theories. The virgate in its inception can\r\nnot be a typical tenement; it is a fraction of a typical tenement.\r\n\r\n[The yard-land in laws and charters.]\r\n\r\nWhat we have here been saying seems to be borne out by the Anglo-Saxon\r\nlaws and charters. They barely recognize the existence of such entities\r\nas yard-lands or virgates. The charters, it must be confessed, deal with\r\nlarge tracts and seldom have need to notice less than a hide. When,\r\nhowever, they descend below the hide, they at once come down to the\r\nacre, and this although the quantity that they have to specify is 90, or\r\n60 or 30 acres[1304]. On the other hand, any reference to such an unit\r\nas the virgate or yard-land is exceedingly rare. To judge by the\r\ncharters, this is a unit which was but beginning to force itself upon\r\nmen's notice in the last century before the Conquest[1305]. From a\r\nremote time there may have been many tenements that were like the\r\nvirgates or yard-lands of later days; but the old strain of language\r\nthat is preserved in the charters ignores them, has no name for them,\r\nand, when they receive a name, it signifies that they are fractions of a\r\nhouseholder's tenement.\r\n\r\n[The hide not at first a measure.]\r\n\r\nAs an unit larger than the acre men have known nothing but the hide, the\r\nmanse, the land of one family, the land of one householder. This is what\r\nwe find in England: also it is found in Germany and Scandinavia[1306].\r\nThe state bases its structure, its taxation, its military system, upon\r\nthe theory that such units exist and can be fairly treated as equal or\r\nequivalent. This theory must have facts behind it, though in course of\r\ntime the state may thrust it upon lands that it will not fit, for\r\nexample, upon a land of ring-fenced property where there is no\r\napproximate equality between the various tenements. In its origin a hide\r\nwill not be a measure of land. A measure is an idea; a hide is a\r\ntenement. The 'foot' does not begin by being twelve inches; it begins by\r\nbeing a part of the human body. The 'acre' does not begin by being 4840\r\nsquare yards; it begins by being a strip in the fields that is ploughed\r\nin a forenoon. But unless there were much equality between human feet,\r\nthe foot would not become a measure; nor would the acre become a measure\r\nunless the method of ploughing land were fairly uniform. A great deal of\r\nsimilarity between the 'real' hides or 'householder's lands' we must\r\nneeds suppose if the hide becomes a measure; not only must those in any\r\none village be much alike, there must be similarity between the\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\n[The hide as a measure.]\r\n\r\nAfter a certain sort the hide does become a measure. Bede does not\r\nbelieve that if the families in the Isle of Wight were counted, the sum\r\nwould be just 1200. The Anglo-Saxon kings are giving away half-hides or\r\nhalf-manses as well as manses or hides. They can speak of three hides\r\nand thirty acres[1307] or of two hides less sixty acres[1308]. Men are\r\nbeginning to work sums in hides and acres as they work sums in pounds\r\nand pence. Indubitably such sums are worked in Domesday Book. In the\r\nthirteenth century the hide can even be treated as a pure superficial\r\nmeasure. An instance is given by an 'extent' of the village of Sawston\r\nin Cambridgeshire. The content of about two hundred small parcels of\r\nland is given in terms of acres and roods. Then an addition sum is\r\nworked and a total is stated in hides, virgates and acres, the equation\r\nthat is employed being 1 H. = 4 V. = 120 A. It is a remarkable case,\r\nbecause the area, not only of arable land, but of meadows, pasture,\r\ncrofts, gardens and messuages is added up into hides. The hide is here a\r\npure measure, a mere multiple of acres[1309]. The men who made this\r\n'extent' could have spoken of a hide of cloth. But this seems a rare and\r\nit is a late instance. At an earlier time the hide is conceived as\r\nconsisting only of arable acres with appurtenances.\r\n\r\n[The hide as a measure of arable.]\r\n\r\nA word to explain this conception. In very old times when men thought of\r\nland as the subject-matter of grants and taxes they spoke only of arable\r\nland[1310]. If we are to understand their sayings and doings, we must\r\nthink ourselves into an economic arrangement very different from that in\r\nwhich we are now immersed. We must well-nigh abolish buying and selling.\r\nEvery village, perhaps every hide, must be very nearly self-sufficient.\r\nNow when once population has grown so thick that nomadic practices are\r\nforsaken, the strain of supporting mankind falls almost wholly on the\r\nploughed land. That strain is severe. Many acres feed few people. Thus\r\nthe arable becomes prominent. But further, arable implies pasture. This\r\nis not a legal theory; it is a physical fact. A householder can not have\r\narable land unless he has pasture rights. Arable land is land that is\r\nploughed; ploughing implies oxen; oxen, pasture. Our householder can not\r\nuse a steam-plough; what is more, he can not buy hay. If he keeps\r\nbeasts, they must eat. If he does not keep beasts, he has no arable\r\nland. Lastly, as a general rule men do not possess pasture land in\r\nseveralty; they turn out their beasts on 'the common of the vill.'\r\nTherefore, in very old schemes of taxation and the like, pasture land is\r\nneglected: not because it is unimportant, but because it is\r\nindispensably necessary. It may be taken for granted. If a man has 120\r\nacres of arable land, he must have adequate pasture rights; there must\r\nbe in Domesday's language _pastura sufficens carucis_. And in the\r\ncommon case there will be not much more than sufficient pasture. If\r\nthere were, it would soon be broken up to provide more corn. Every\r\nvillage must be self-supporting, and therefore an equilibrium of arable\r\nand pasture will be established in every village. Thus if, for fiscal\r\nand governmental purposes, there is to be a typical tenement, it may be\r\na tenement of _x_ arable acres, and nothing need be said of any other\r\nkind of ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hide of 120 acres.]\r\n\r\nWe are going to argue that the Anglo-Saxons give 120 acres, arable\r\nacres, to the hide. Our main argument will be that the equation 1 H. =\r\n120 A. is implied in the fiscal system revealed by Domesday Book. But,\r\nby way of making this equation probable, we may notice that, if we had\r\nno evidence later than the Conquest, all that we should find on the face\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon land-books would be favourable to this equation. In\r\nthe first place, on the only occasion on which we hear of the content of\r\na hide, it is put at 120 acres[1311]. In the second place, when a number\r\nof acres is mentioned, it is commonly one of those numbers, such as 150,\r\n90, 80, 60, 30, which will often occur if hides of 120 acres are being\r\npartitioned[1312]. The force of this last remark may seem to be\r\ndiminished if we remember how excellent a dividend is 120. It is neatly\r\ndivisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12. But then we must reflect that\r\nthis very quality recommended it to organizers, more especially as there\r\nwere 240 pence in the pound.\r\n\r\n[Real and fiscal hides.]\r\n\r\nSupposing for a moment that we bring home this equation to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon financiers, there would still remain the question how far it\r\ntruthfully represented agrarian facts. To that question no precise\r\nanswer can be given: the truth lies somewhere between two extremes. We\r\nmust not for one instant believe that England was so neat a chess-board\r\nas a rude fiscal theory paints, where every pawn stands on its square,\r\nevery 'family' in the centre of 120 acre-strips of 4 by 40 perches. The\r\nbarbarian, for all his materialism, is an idealist. He is, like the\r\nchild, a master in the art of make-believe. He sees things not as they\r\nare, but as they might conveniently be. Every householder has a hide;\r\nevery hide has 120 acres of arable; every hide is worth one pound a\r\nyear; every householder has a team; every team is of eight oxen; every\r\nteam is worth one pound. If all this be not so, then it ought to be so\r\nand must be deemed to be so. Then by a Procrustean process he packs the\r\ncomplex and irregular facts into his scheme. What is worse, he will not\r\ncount. He will assume that a large district has a round 1200 hides, and\r\nwill then ordain that those hides must be found. We see this on a small\r\nscale if we study manorial 'extents' or village maps. The virgates are\r\nnot equal; the acres are far from equal; but they are deemed to be\r\nequal[1313]. Nevertheless, we must stop short of the other extreme or we\r\nshall be over-estimating the power of such government and the\r\noriginality of such statesmanship as existed. Theories like those of\r\nwhich we are speaking are born of facts and in their turn generate new\r\nfacts. Our forefathers really lived in a simpler and a more\r\nchess-board-like England than that which we know. There must have been\r\nmuch equality among the hides and among the villages. When we see that a\r\n'hundred' in Cambridgeshire has exactly 100 hides which are distributed\r\nbetween six vills of 10 hides apiece and eight vills of 5 hides apiece,\r\nthis simple symmetry is in part the unreal outcome of a capricious\r\nmethod of taxation, but in part it is a real economic fact. There was an\r\nEnglish conquest of England, and, to all seeming, the conquest of\r\neastern England was singularly thorough. In all probability a great many\r\nvillages were formed approximately at one time and on one plan.\r\nConveniently simple figures could be drawn, for the slate was\r\nclean[1314].\r\n\r\n[Causes of divergence of fiscal from real hides.]\r\n\r\nHowever, at an early time the hide becomes an unit in a system of\r\nassessment. The language of the land-books tells us that this is\r\nso[1315]. Already in Ine's day we hear of the amount of victual that ten\r\nhides must find for the king's support[1316]. About the end of the tenth\r\ncentury the duty of maintaining burgs is bound up with the possession of\r\nhides[1317]. Before the end of that century heavy sums are being raised\r\nas a tribute for the Danes. For this purpose, as we shall try to show\r\nhereafter, 'hides' are cast upon shires and hundreds by those who,\r\ninstead of counting, make pleasantly convenient assumptions about the\r\ncapacity of provinces and districts, and in all probability the\r\nassumptions made in the oldest times were the furthest from the truth.\r\nNow and again the assessments of shires and hundreds were corrected in a\r\nmanner which, so far as we are concerned, only made matters worse. It\r\nbecomes apparent that hides are not of one value or nearly of one value.\r\nThis becomes painfully apparent when Cornwall and other far western\r\nlands are brought under contribution. So large sums of hides are struck\r\noff the poorer counties. The fiscal 'hide' becomes a lame compromise\r\nbetween an unit of area and an unit of value. Then privilege confounds\r\nconfusion; the estates of favoured churches and nobles are 'beneficially\r\nhidated.' But this is not all. Probably the real hides, the real old\r\nsettlers' tenements, which you could count if you looked at a village\r\nand its fields, are rapidly going to pieces, and the fragments thereof\r\nare entering into new combinations. In the lordless villages economic\r\nforces of an easily imaginable kind will make for this end. Not only may\r\nwe suppose some increase of population, especially where Danes swarm in,\r\nand some progress in the art of agriculture, but also the bond of blood\r\nbecomes weaker and the _familia_ that lives in one house grows smaller.\r\nSo the hides go to pieces. The birth of trade and the establishment of\r\nmarkets help this process. It is no longer necessary that every tenement\r\nshould be self-sufficient; men can buy what they do not grow. The\r\nformation of manors may have tended in some sort to arrest this\r\nmovement. A system of equal (theoretically equal) tenements was\r\nconvenient to lords who were collecting 'provender rents' and extending\r\ntheir powers; but under seignorial pressure virgates, rather than\r\nhides, were likely to become the prominent units. We may well believe\r\nthat if to make two ears of corn grow where one grew is to benefit\r\nmankind, the lords were public benefactors, and that the husbandry of\r\nthe manors was more efficient than was that of the lordless townships.\r\nThe clergy were in touch with their fellows on the Continent; also the\r\nchurch's reeve was a professional agriculturist and might even write a\r\ntract on the management of manors[1318]. There was more cooperation,\r\nmore communalism, less waste. A family could live and thrive upon a\r\nvirgate[1319].\r\n\r\n[Effects of the divergence of fiscal from real hides.]\r\n\r\nBut, what concerns us at the present moment is the, for us disastrous,\r\neffect of this divergence of the fiscal from the real hide. Even if\r\nfinance had not complicated the problem, we should, as we have already\r\nseen, have found many difficulties if we tried to construe medieval\r\nstatements of acreage. Already we should have had three different\r\n'acres' to think of. We will imagine that a village has 590 'acre\r\nstrips' in its field. In one sense, therefore, it has 590 acres. But the\r\nideal to which these strips tend and were meant to conform is that of\r\nacres measured by a rod of 15 feet. Measured by that rod there would, we\r\nwill suppose, be 550 acres. Then, however, we may use the royal rod and\r\nsay that there are 454 acres or thereabouts. But the field was divided\r\ninto five tenements that were known as hides, and the general theory is\r\nthat a hide (householder's land) contains, or must be supposed to\r\ncontain, 120 acres. Therefore there are here 600 acres. And now a\r\npartitionary method of taxation stamps this as a vill of four hides.\r\nConsequently the 'hide' of this village may have as many as 150 or as\r\nfew as 90 'acres.' It ought not to be so. It would not be so if men were\r\nalways distinguishing between 'acre strips' and measured acres, between\r\n'real' hides (which, to tell truth, are no longer real, since they are\r\nfalling to pieces) and 'fiscal' or 'geld' hides. But it will be so. Here\r\nand there we may see an effort to keep up distinctions between the\r\n'carucate for gelding' and the 'carucate for ploughing,' between the\r\nreal acre and the acre 'for defence (_acra warae_)[1320]'; but men tire\r\nof these long phrases and argue backwards and forwards between the\r\nrateable and the real. Hence some of the worst puzzles of Domesday\r\nBook[1321].\r\n\r\n[Acreage of the hide in later days.]\r\n\r\nSuch being the causes of perplexity, it is perhaps surprising that in\r\nthe thirteenth century when we begin to obtain a large stock of manorial\r\nextents, 'the hide' should still exhibit some uniformity. But, unless we\r\nhave been misled by a partial induction, a tendency to reckon 120 rather\r\nthan any other number of acres to the hide is plainly perceptible. The\r\nfollowing are the equations that prevailed on the manors of Ramsey\r\nAbbey, which were scattered in the eastern midlands[1322].\r\n\r\n  _Huntingdonshire_\r\n       Upwood with Raveley   1 H. = 4 V.     =  80 A.\r\n       Wistow                1 H. = 4 V.     = 120 A.\r\n       Broughton             1 H. = 6-1/2 V. = 208 A.\r\n       Warboys               1 H. = 4 V.     = 120 A.\r\n       Holywell              1 H. = 5 V.     =  90 A.\r\n       Slepe (St Ives)       1 H. = 5 V.     =  80 A.\r\n       Houghton with Wyton   1 H. = 6 V.     = 108 A.\r\n       Hemingford            1 H. = 6 V.     =  96 A.\r\n       Dillington            1 H. = 6 V.     = 201 A.\r\n       Weston                1 H. = 4 V.     = 112 A.\r\n       Brington              1 H. = 4 V.     = 136 A.\r\n       Bythorn               1 H. = 4 V.     = 176 A.\r\n       Gidding               1 H. = 4 V.     = 112 A.\r\n       Elton                 1 H. = 6 V.     = 144 A.\r\n       Stukeley              1 H. = 4 V.     =  96 A.\r\n       Ripton with Remington 1 H. = 4 V.     =  62 A.\r\n\r\n  _Northamptonshire_\r\n\r\n       Barnwell              1 H. = 7 V.     = 252 A.\r\n       Hemington             1 H. = 7 V.     = 252 A.\r\n\r\n  _Bedfordshire_\r\n\r\n       Cranfield             1 H. = 4 V.     = 192 A.\r\n       Barton                1 H. = 4 V.     =  96 A.\r\n       Shitlingdon           1 H. = 4 V.     =  48 A.\r\n\r\n  _Hertfordshire_\r\n\r\n       Therfield           1 H. = 4 V.       = 256 A.\r\n\r\n  _Suffolk_\r\n\r\n       Lawshall            1 H. = 3 V.       = 156 A.\r\n\r\n  _Norfolk_\r\n\r\n       Brancaster          1 H. = 4 V.       = 160 A.\r\n       Ringstead           1 H. = 4 V.       = 120 A.\r\n\r\n  _Cambridgeshire_\r\n\r\n       Elsworth            1 H. = 4 V.       = 120 A.\r\n       Knapwell            1 H. = 4 V.       = 160 A.\r\n       Graveley Freehold   1 H. = 7 V.       = unknown\r\n                Villeinage 1 H. = 6-3/4 V.   = 135 A.\r\n       Over                1 H. = 4 V.       = 120 A.\r\n       Girton              1 H. = 4 V.       = 120 A.\r\n       Burwell             1 H. = 4 V.       = 120 A.\r\n\r\nHere in thirty-one instances what we take to be the normal equation\r\nappears but seven times, but no other equation occurs more than twice.\r\nMoreover, so far as we have observed, the variations in the acreage that\r\nwill be ascribed to a hide are not provincial, they are villar\r\nvariations: that is to say, though we may see that the average hide of\r\none county would have more acres than those that are contained in the\r\naverage hide of another, we can not affirm that the hide of a certain\r\ncounty or hundred contains _a_ acres, while that of another has _b_\r\nacres, and, on the other hand, we often see a startling difference\r\nbetween two contiguous villages. Lastly, where the computation of 120\r\nacres to a hide is forsaken, we see little agreement in favour of any\r\nother equation. In particular, though now and again the hide of a\r\nvillage will perchance have 240 acres, we can find no trace of any\r\n'double hide' in which ingenuity might see a link between the Roman and\r\nEnglish systems of measurement and taxation[1323]. The only other\r\ngeneral proposition which our evidence suggests is that a land which\r\nhabitually displays unusually large virgates will often be a land in\r\nwhich a given area of arable soil has borne an unusually light weight of\r\ntaxation, and this, as we shall hereafter see, will often, though not\r\nalways, be a land where a given area of arable soil has been deemed to\r\nbear an unusually small value. But this connexion between many-acred\r\nhides and light taxation is not very strongly marked in our\r\ncartularies[1324].\r\n\r\n[The carucate and bovate.]\r\n\r\nIn the land-books which deal with Kent the _aratrum_ or _sulung_[1325]\r\nis commoner than the hide or manse, and Domesday Book shows us that in\r\nKent the _solin_ (_sulung_) is the fiscal unit that plays the part that\r\nis elsewhere played by the hide. That same part is played in Suffolk,\r\nNorfolk, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and the counties of Derby, Nottingham\r\nand Leicester by the _carucata_, which has for its eighth part the\r\n_bovata_. These terms seem to be French: that is to say, they apparently\r\nformed no part of the official Latin that had been current in\r\nEngland[1326]. We may infer, however, that they translated some English,\r\nor rather perhaps some Scandinavian terms, for only in Danish counties\r\ndo we find them used to describe the geldable units. It is exceedingly\r\ndoubtful whether we ought to treat this method of reckoning as older\r\nthan the Danish invasions. Bede, himself a Northumbrian, uses the\r\n'family-land' as his unit, no matter what be the part of England of\r\nwhich he is speaking, and his translator uses the _híd_ or _hiwisc_ in\r\nthe same indiscriminate fashion. Unfortunately the 'carucated' shires\r\nare those which yield us hardly any land-books, and we do not know what\r\nthe English jurors said when the Norman clerks wrote _carucata_ and\r\n_bovata_: perhaps _plough-gate_ and _ox-gate_, or _plough-gang_ and\r\n_ox-gang_, or, again, a _plough of land_, for these were the vernacular\r\nwords of a later age. On the whole, the little evidence that we have\r\nseems to point to the greater antiquity in England of a reckoning which\r\ntakes the 'house-land' rather than the 'plough-land' as its unit[1327].\r\n\r\n[The ox-gang.]\r\n\r\nAs to the bovate or ox-gang, it seems to be an unit only in the same\r\nsense as that in which the virgate or yard-land is an unit; the one is\r\nthe eighth, the other is the fourth of an unit. That, in days when eight\r\noxen are yoked to a plough, the eighth of a plough-gang should be called\r\nan ox-gang will not surprise us, though, as a matter of fact, an ox\r\nnever 'goes' or ploughs in solitude[1328]. In our Latin documents a\r\nthird part of a knight's fee will be, not _tertia pars feodi unius\r\nmilitis_, but far more commonly, _feodum tertiae partis unius militis_.\r\nWe do not infer from this that fractions of knights, or fractions of\r\nknight's fees are older than integral knights and integral fees. The\r\nbovate seems to have been much less widely known than the carucate, for\r\napparently it had no place in the computation that was generally used in\r\nEast Anglia, where men reckoned by carucates, half-carucates and acres\r\nand where the virgate was not absolutely unknown[1329].\r\n\r\n[The fiscal carucate.] In the financial system, as we have\r\nsaid, the carucate plays for some counties the part that is played for\r\nothers by the hide. Fiscally they seem to be equivalent: that is to say,\r\nwhen every hide of Wessex is to pay two shillings, every carucate of\r\nLincolnshire will pay that sum. We think also and shall try to show that\r\nthe Exchequer reckons 120 acres to the carucate, or, in other words,\r\nthat if a tenement taxed as a carucate were divided into six equal\r\nshares, each share would at the Exchequer be called 20 acres. The same\r\nforces, however, which have made the fiscal hide diverge widely from the\r\n'real' hide have played upon the plough-gangs of the Danelaw. In the\r\nBoldon Book we read of many bovates with 15 acres apiece, though the\r\nfigures 20, 13-1/2, 12-1/2, 12 and 8 are also represented, and, when we\r\ncome to the extents of the thirteenth century, we seem to see in the\r\nnorth but a feeble tendency to any uniformity among the equations that\r\nconnect carucates with acres. The numbers of the acres in a bovate given\r\nby a series of Yorkshire inquests is 7, 7, 8, 15, 12, 6, 12, 15, 15, 6,\r\n5, 9, 10, 10, 12, 24, 4, 16, 12, 18, 8, 6, 10, 24, 32[1330]. With a\r\nbovate of 4 acres, our carucate would have no more than 32. But then, in\r\nthe north we may find very long rods and very large acres[1331], and,\r\nwhere Danes have settled, we have the best reason to expect those\r\ncomplications which would arise from the superimposition of a new set of\r\nmeasures upon a territory that had been arranged to suit another\r\nset[1332].\r\n\r\n[Acreage tilled by a plough.]\r\n\r\nHaving been led into speaking of plough-gangs, we may end these\r\ndiscursive remarks by a gentle protest against the use that is sometimes\r\nmade of the statements that are found in the book called Fleta. It is a\r\nsecond-rate legal treatise of Edward I.'s day. It seems to have fallen\r\ndead from its author's pen and it hardly deserved a better fate. For the\r\nmore part it is a poor abstract of Bracton's work. When it ceases to\r\npillage Bracton, it pillages other authors, and what it says of\r\nploughing appears to be derived at second hand from Walter of\r\nHenley[1333]. Now Walter of Henley's successful and popular treatise on\r\nHusbandry is a good and important book; but we must be careful before we\r\ntreat it as an exponent of the traditional mode of agriculture, for\r\nevidently Walter was an enlightened reformer. We might even call him the\r\nArthur Young of his time. Now, it is sometimes said that according to\r\nFleta 'the carucate' would have 160 acres in 'a two course manor' and\r\n180 in 'a three course manor.' A reference to Walter of Henley will show\r\nhim endeavouring to convince the men of his time that such amounts as\r\nthese really can be ploughed, if they work hard. 'Some men will tell you\r\nthat a plough can not till eight score or nine score acres by the year,\r\nbut I will show you that it can.' His calculation is worth repeating. It\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n  The year has 52 weeks. Deduct 8 for holy-days and other hindrances.\r\n  There remain 44 weeks or 264 days, Sundays excluded.\r\n\r\n  _Two course._ Plough 40 acres for winter\r\n  seed, 40 for spring seed and 80 for fallow\r\n  (total 160) at 7/8ths of an acre per day         = 182-6/7 days\r\n\r\n  Also plough by way of second fallowing 80\r\n  acres at an acre per day                         =  80 days\r\n                                                           --------\r\n                                              Total  262-6/7 days[1334].\r\n\r\n[Walter of Henley's scheme.]\r\n\r\nIt is a strenuous and sanguine, if not an impossible, programme. When\r\nharvest time and the holy weeks are omitted, the plough is to 'go' every\r\nweek-day throughout the year, despite frost and tempest. Obviously it is\r\na programme that can only enter the head of an enthusiastic lord who has\r\nsupernumerary oxen, and will know how to fill the place of a ploughman\r\nwho is ill. We have little warrant for believing that what Walter hopes\r\nto do is being commonly done in his day, less for importing his projects\r\ninto an earlier age. In order that he may keep his beasts up to their\r\narduous toil, he proposes to feed them with oats during half the\r\nyear[1335]. If we inferred that the Saxon invaders of England treated\r\ntheir oxen thus, we might be guilty of an anachronism differing only in\r\ndegree from that which would furnish them with steam-ploughs. But, to\r\ncome to much later days, the Domesday of St. Paul's enables us to say\r\nwith some certainty that the ordinary team of eight beasts accomplished\r\nno such feats as those of which Walter speaks. For example, at Thorpe in\r\nEssex the canons have about 180 acres of arable land in demesne. These,\r\nit is estimated, can be tilled by one team of ten heads together with\r\nthe ploughing service that is due from the tenants, and these tenants\r\nhave to plough at least 80 acres, to wit, 40 in winter and 40 in\r\nLent[1336]. We must observe that to till even 120 acres according to\r\nWalter's two-course plan would mean that a plough must 'go' 180 acres in\r\nevery year, and that, even if it does its acre every day, more than half\r\nthe week-days in the year must be devoted to ploughing. We may, however,\r\nseriously doubt whether a scheme which would plough the land thrice\r\nbetween every two crops had been generally prevalent[1337]. Nay, we may\r\neven doubt whether the practice of fallowing had been universal[1338].\r\nNot unfrequently in our cartularies the villein is required to plough\r\nbetween Michaelmas and Christmas and again between Christmas and Lady\r\nDay, while nothing is said of his ploughing in the summer[1339]. We are\r\nonly beginning to learn a little about medieval agriculture.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have now said all that we had to say by way of preface to\r\nwhat we fear will be a dreary and inconclusive discussion of some of\r\nthose abundant figures that Domesday Book supplies. A few we have\r\nendeavoured to collect in the tables which will meet the reader's eye\r\nwhen he turns this page, and which will be explained on later pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1217] D.

A system which leaves half the land idle in every year\r\n         is of course quite compatible with the growth of both winter\r\n         and spring corn. When, as is not uncommon, the villeins have\r\n         to do between Michaelmas and Christmas twice as much\r\n         ploughing as they will do between Christmas and Lady Day,\r\n         this seems to point to a scheme which leaves one field idle\r\n         and divides the other between winter and spring corn in the\r\n         proportion of 2:1.

Apparently the only measure of length of which\r\n         any standard was made was the _ulna_ or cloth-yard.\r\n\r\n  [1250] See the apocryphal Statute of Admeasurement, Stat., vol. i.\r\n         p. 206.\r\n\r\n  [1251] If the jurors had superficial measure in their heads and were\r\n         stating this by reference to two straight lines, they would\r\n         make the length of one of these lines a constant (e.g. one\r\n         league or one furlong). This is not done: the space is 6\r\n         furlongs in length by 3 in breadth, 14 furlongs in length by\r\n         4 in breadth, 9 furlongs and 1 perch in length by 5 furlongs\r\n         and 2 perches in breadth (instances from Norfolk) or the\r\n         like. They are endeavouring to indicate shape as well as\r\n         size. See the method of measurement adopted in K. 594 (iii.\r\n         129): 'and ðær ðæt land unbradest is ðer hit sceol beon\r\n         eahtatyne fota brad.'\r\n\r\n  [1252] The league of 12 furlongs has dropped out of modern usage; it\r\n         is very prominent in D. B., where miles, though not unknown,\r\n         are rare.\r\n\r\n  [1253] Our foot is ·30479 meters. Our perch is very close to 5\r\n         meters. Our acre 40·467 ares. A hide of 120 acres would be\r\n         48·56 hectares.\r\n\r\n  [1254] Statutes of the Realm, i. 206: 'Tres pedes faciunt ulnam.'\r\n         Though this equation gets established, the _ulna_ or\r\n         cloth-yard seems to start by being an arm's length. See the\r\n         story that Henry I. made his own arm a standard: Will.\r\n         Malmesb. Gesta Regum., ii. 487. Britton, i. 189, tells us\r\n         that the _aune_ contains two cubits and two thumbs (inches).\r\n         Our yard seems too long to be a step.\r\n\r\n  [1255] Second Report of Commissioners for Weights and Measures,\r\n         Parliamentary Papers, 1820, Reports, vol. vii.\r\n\r\n  [1256] As to all this see Meitzen, op. cit. i. 272 fol.\r\n\r\n  [1257] The ratio 10:1 is not the only one that is well represented\r\n         in Germany. The practice of making the acre four rods wide is\r\n         more universal. As we shall see below, length must take its\r\n         chance.\r\n\r\n  [1258] Morgan, England under the Normans, 19.\r\n\r\n  [1259] Pollock, E. H. R. xi. 218.\r\n\r\n  [1260] Morgan, op. cit. 19, citing Monasticon, iv. 421.\r\n\r\n  [1261] Second Report of the Commissioners for Weights and Measures,\r\n         Parliamentary Papers, 1820, Reports, vol. vii. The\r\n         information thus obtained might have been better sifted. When\r\n         it is said that a certain customary perch contains 15 feet 1\r\n         inch, these feet and inches are statute feet and statute\r\n         inches. Probably this perch had exactly 15 'customary' feet.\r\n         So, again, it is likely that every 'customary' acre contained\r\n         160 'customary' perches.\r\n\r\n  [1262] See below, p. 382.\r\n\r\n  [1263] Compare Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 560.\r\n\r\n  [1264] Morgan, op. cit. 22.\r\n\r\n  [1265] Anonymous Husbandry, see Walter of Henley, ed.

This charter is\r\n         commended to geometers. We see, however, that the 'yard' in\r\n         question is longer than 6 feet; it is connected with our\r\n         perch, not with our cloth yard. Schmid, App. XII.: 3 miles, 3\r\n         furlongs, 3 acre-breadths, 9 feet, 9 hand-breadths and 9\r\n         barley-corns.\r\n\r\n  [1267] Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 554. This _virga regalis_ is set down\r\n         at 4·70 meters; our statute perch stands very close to 5\r\n         meters.\r\n\r\n  [1268] Meitzen, op. cit. i. 278.\r\n\r\n  [1269] Ellis, Introduction, i. 116.\r\n\r\n  [1270] The use of _quarentina_ for furlong may be due to the\r\n         Normans.\r\n\r\n  [1271] Delisle, Études sur la condition de la classe agricole en\r\n         Normandie, 531-2.\r\n\r\n  [1272] We find from D. B. i. 166 that there was a royal _sextarius_;\r\n         but (i. 162, 238) other _sextarii_ were in use.\r\n\r\n  [1273] Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 564. Thus in Köln, the Morgen is 31·72\r\n         ares, the Waldmorgen 38·06 ares. In Brunswick the Feldmorgen\r\n         is 25·02 ares, the Waldmorgen 33·35 ares. So in Sussex the\r\n         common acres are small; the forest acre = 180 (instead of\r\n         160) perches. So in Herefordshire the common acre is put down\r\n         at two-thirds of the statute acre, but an acre of wood is\r\n         more than an acre and a half of statute measure.\r\n\r\n  [1274] Registr. Honor. Richemund., Ap., p. 11, Agard says: 'In the\r\n         Arrentation of Assarts of Forests made in Henry III.'s and\r\n         Edward I.'s times, for forest ground the commissioners let\r\n         the land _per perticam xx. pedum_,' though by this time the\r\n         16·5 foot perch was the established royal measure for\r\n         ordinary purposes. In a Buckinghamshire Fine levied in John's\r\n         reign (Hunter, i. 242) we find acres of land which are\r\n         measured 'by the lawful perch of the vill,' while acres of\r\n         wood are measured 'by the perch of the king.' Ibid. 13, 178:\r\n         a perch of 20 feet was being used in the counties of Bedford\r\n         and Buckingham, though Bedfordshire is notorious for small\r\n         acres. The obscure processes that go on in the history of\r\n         measures might be illustrated from the report cited above, p.\r\n         374, note 1261; the length of the 'customary' perch varies\r\n         inversely with the difficulty of the work to be done. In\r\n         Herefordshire a perch of fencing was 21 feet, a perch of\r\n         walling 16·5. And so forth.\r\n\r\n  [1275] Morgan, op. cit. 27, suggests a double goad. The _g[=a]d_ of\r\n         modern Cambridgeshire has been a stick 9 feet long; but the\r\n         surveyor put eight into the acre-breadth, reckoning two of\r\n         these _g[=a]ds_ to the customary pole of 18 feet. See Pell,\r\n         in Domesday Studies, i. 276, 296. A rod that is 18 feet long\r\n         is a clumsy thing and perhaps for practical purposes it has\r\n         been cut in half. Meitzen, op. cit., i. 90: Two\r\n         hunting-spears would make a measuring rod. See also Hanssen,\r\n         Abhandlungen, ii. 210.\r\n\r\n  [1276] Seebohm, op. cit. 119. Welsh evidence seems to point this\r\n         way.\r\n\r\n  [1277] K. 529 (iii. 4): '12 æceras mædwa.'--K. 549 (iii. 33).--K.\r\n         683 (iii. 263).\r\n\r\n  [1278] When Walter of Henley, p. 8, is making his calculations as to\r\n         the amount of land that can be ploughed in a day, he assumes\r\n         that the work will be over a _noune_. The 'by three o'clock'\r\n         of his translator is too precise and too late. At whatever\r\n         hour nones should have been said, the word _noon_ became our\r\n         name for twelve o'clock. See also Seebohm, op. cit. 124.\r\n\r\n  [1279] Meitzen, op. cit., ii. 565. The rods known in Germany range\r\n         upwards from very short South German rods which descend from\r\n         the Roman _pertica_ to much longer rods which lie between 4\r\n         meters and 5. Our statute perch just exceeds 5 meters. Then\r\n         the ordinary (not forest) _Morgen_ rarely approaches 40 ares,\r\n         while our statute acre is equivalent to 40·46 ares. However,\r\n         the Scandinavian _Tonne_ is yet larger and recalls the big\r\n         acres of northern England. In France perches of 18 feet were\r\n         common, and in Normandy yet longer perches were used, but we\r\n         do not know that the French _acre_ or _journal_ contained 160\r\n         square perches.\r\n\r\n  [1280] Seebohm, op. cit. 166.\r\n\r\n  [1281] Seebohm, op. cit. 19.\r\n\r\n  [1282] Thus e.g. Glastonbury Rentalia, 68: 'if he has eight oxen he\r\n         shall plough every Thursday [during certain seasons] three\r\n         roods [_perticatas_].'\r\n\r\n  [1283] Walter of Henley, 9.\r\n\r\n  [1284] Tour through the Southern Counties, ed. 3 (1772), pp.\r\n         298-301.\r\n\r\n  [1285] Tour through the Southern Counties, p. 127.\r\n\r\n  [1286] Walter of Henley, 9.\r\n\r\n  [1287] Young, View of Agriculture of Oxfordshire, p. 104. In\r\n         Oxfordshire in the early years of this century many ploughs\r\n         with four horses 'go out for 3 roods,' after all improvements\r\n         in ploughs and in horses.\r\n\r\n  [1288] Meitzen, op. cit. 88. Dr Taylor in Domesday Studies, i. 61,\r\n         gives a somewhat different explanation. The ploughman walked\r\n         backwards in front of the beasts, and, when near the end of\r\n         the furrow, used his right arm to pull them round.\r\n\r\n  [1289] Among the land-books those that most clearly indicate the\r\n         intermixture of strips are K. 538 (iii. 19),--648 (iii.\r\n         210),--692 (iii. 290),--1158 (v. 310),--1169 (v. 326),--1234\r\n         (vi. 39),--1240 (vi. 51),--1276 (vi. 108),--1278 (vi. 111).\r\n\r\n  [1290] As to the names of _culturæ_ the Ramsey Cartulary may be\r\n         profitably consulted. Such names as Horsepelfurlange,\r\n         Wodefurlonge, Benefurlange, Stapelfurlange (i. 307),\r\n         Mikellefurlange (321), Stanweyfurlange, Longefurlange (331)\r\n         are common. We meet also with _-wong_: Redewonge (321),\r\n         Langiwange, Stoniwonge, Schortewonge, Semareswonge (341-2).\r\n         Also with _-leuge_ (apparently O. E. _léah_, gen. dat.\r\n         _léage_): Wolnothesleuge, Edriches Leuge. Often the _cultura_\r\n         is known as the Five (Ten, Twenty) Acres. Sometimes in Latin\r\n         this sense of _furlong_ is rendered by _quarentina_: 'unam\r\n         rodam in quarentina de Newedich': Fines, ed. Hunter, i. 42.\r\n\r\n  [1291] Glastonbury Rentalia, 180, 195, 208.\r\n\r\n  [1292] Sixteen Old Maps: Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1888.\r\n\r\n  [1293] The rod, however, must have been very short; perhaps it had\r\n         as few as 12 feet.\r\n\r\n  [1294] For many reasons this must not be taken as a typical map. We\r\n         refer to it merely as showing the relation of 'estimated'\r\n         (that is of 'real') acres to an acre-measure.\r\n\r\n  [1295] Instructive evidence about this matter was given in a\r\n         Chancery suit of James I.'s reign. The deponent speaking of\r\n         the fen round Ely says 'it is the use and custom ... to\r\n         measure the fen grounds by four poles in breadth for an acre,\r\n         by a pole of 18 feet ... and in length for an acre of the\r\n         said grounds as it happeneth, according to the length of the\r\n         furlong of the same fens, which is sometimes shorter and\r\n         sometimes longer.' Quoted by O. C. Pell in Domesday Studies,\r\n         i. 296.\r\n\r\n  [1296] For an explanation of this mode of ploughing, see Meitzen,\r\n         op. cit. 84.\r\n\r\n  [1297] Meitzen gives 6 feet as a usual width for the beds in\r\n         Germany. I think that in cent. xiii. our selions were usually\r\n         wider than this.\r\n\r\n  [1298] The Gloucester Corporation Records, ed. Stevenson (1893),\r\n         should be consulted. When small pieces of land were being\r\n         conveyed, the selions were often enumerated. Thus (p. 124):\r\n         'and 13 acres of arable land ... whereof one acre lies upon\r\n         þistelege near Durand's land ... an acre and a half being\r\n         three selions ... half an acre being two selions ... an acre\r\n         of five selions ... an acre being one selion and a gore ...\r\n         four selions and two little gores ... an acre being three\r\n         selions and a head-land.' In Mr Seebohm's admirable account\r\n         of the open fields there seems to me to be some confusion\r\n         between the selions and the acre or half-acre strips.\r\n\r\n  [1299] On Mr Mowat's map of Roxton a quarter-acre strip is a\r\n         _yeard_.\r\n\r\n  [1300] D. B. i. 364: 'In Staintone habuit Jalf 5 bovatas terrae et\r\n         14 acras terrae et 1 virgatam ad geldum.' This virgate is a\r\n         quarter-acre. The continuous use of _virgata_ in this sense\r\n         is attested by Glastonbury Rentalia, 27. So in Normandy:\r\n         Delisle, Études sur la condition de la classe agricole, 535.\r\n         So in France: Ducange, s. v. _virgata_ from a Register of the\r\n         Chamber of Accounts: 'Quadraginta perticae faciunt virgatam:\r\n         quatuor virgatae faciunt acram.' Meitzen, op. cit. i. 95: in\r\n         Kalenberg a strip that is one rod in breadth is called a\r\n         _Gert_ (our _yard_).\r\n\r\n  [1301] In the Exeter Domesday _virga_ not _virgata_ is the common\r\n         word. In the Exchequer book an abbreviated form is used; but\r\n         _virga_ appears in i. 216 b.\r\n\r\n  [1302] So again, if a _iugum_ is quartered, its quarter can be\r\n         called a virgate. See Denman Ross, Hist. of Landholding, 140;\r\n         Round, Feudal England, 108.\r\n\r\n  [1303] See above, p. 372.\r\n\r\n  [1304] K. 205 (i. 259): 'circiter 30 iugera.'--K. 217 (i. 274): '30\r\n         iugera.'--K. 225 (i. 290): 'hoc est 30 iugerum' ...

There are of course many instances in\r\n         the charters of a _pertica_, _virga_, _gyrd_ used as a\r\n         measure of mere length. See above, p. 375, note 1266, where a\r\n         few are cited.\r\n\r\n  [1306] Meitzen, op. cit. 74. In Germany the _Hufe_, _hoba_, _huoba_,\r\n         _huba_, _etc._ is the unit. This word is said to be connected\r\n         with the modern German _Behuf_, our _behoof_; it is the\r\n         _sors_, the portion that behoves a man. In Sweden, the unit\r\n         is the _Mantal_, a man's share. The last word about the\r\n         _tenmannetale_ of Yorkshire has not been said.\r\n\r\n  [1307] K. 633 (iii. 188).\r\n\r\n  [1308] K. 612 (iii. 159): 'landes sumne dæl, ðæt synd 2 hida, buton\r\n         60 æcran ðæt hæft se arcebisceop genumen into Cymesige to his\r\n         hame him to hwætelande.'\r\n\r\n  [1309] Rot. Hund. ii. 575. After going through the whole\r\n         calculation, I have satisfied myself that the sum is worked\r\n         in this way.\r\n\r\n  [1310] Hence in our law Latin the word _terra_ means arable land. To\r\n         claim _unam acram terrae_ when you meant an acre of meadow\r\n         (_prati_) would have been a fatal error.\r\n\r\n  [1311] K. 1222 (vi. 12); T. 508: 'And ic Æðelgar an an hide lond ðes\r\n         ðe Æulf hauede be hundtuelti acren, ateo so he wille.'\r\n         Kemble, Saxons, 117.\r\n\r\n  [1312] See above, p. 386, note 1304.\r\n\r\n  [1313] There can be little need of examples. Glastonbury Rentalia,\r\n         152: 'S. tenet unam virgatam terrae et dimidiam, quae\r\n         computantur pro una virgata.' Ibid. p. 160: 'H. tenet unam\r\n         virgatam et 5 acras, quae omnia computantur pro una virgata.'\r\n         Worcester Register, 62: A virgate consists of 13 acres in one\r\n         field and 12-1/2 in the other; the next virgate of 16 acres\r\n         in one field and 12 in the other. In other cases the numbers\r\n         are 16 and 14; 14-5/8 and 11; 13 and 12-1/2; 14 and 11;\r\n         14-3/4 and 11-1/4. Yet every virgate is a virgate.\r\n\r\n  [1314] At the date of Domesday we are a long way from the first\r\n         danegeld and a very long way from any settlement of\r\n         Cambridgeshire; still if we analyze a symmetrical hundred,\r\n         such as Armingford, we shall find that the average ten-hide\r\n         vill is just about twice as rich as the average five-hide\r\n         vill in men, in teams and in annual _valet_, though there\r\n         will be some wide aberrations from this norm.\r\n\r\n  [1315] See above, p. 336, note 1160.\r\n\r\n  [1316] See above, p. 237.\r\n\r\n  [1317] This is proved by 'The Burghal Hidage' of which we spoke\r\n         above, p. 187, and shall speak again hereafter.\r\n\r\n  [1318] See the Gerefa published by Dr Liebermann in Anglia, ix. 251.\r\n         Andrews, Old English Manor, 246.\r\n\r\n  [1319] The manner in which the old hides have really fallen to\r\n         pieces but are preserving a notional existence is well\r\n         illustrated by Domesday of St. Paul's, 41-47. In one case a\r\n         hide forms nine tenements containing respectively 30, 30, 15,\r\n         15, 5, 5, 7-1/2, 5, 7-1/2 acres. See Vinogradoff, Villainage,\r\n         249.\r\n\r\n  [1320] Vinogradoff, Villainage, 242; Maitland, History of an English\r\n         Manor, Eng. Hist. Rev. ix. 418.\r\n\r\n  [1321] See Pell, in Domesday Studies, i. 357. Almost at one and the\r\n         same moment, but in two different 'extents,' the same\r\n         tenements are being described as containing 15 and as\r\n         containing 18 acres. Domesday of St. Paul's, 69: 'In this\r\n         manor the hide contains 120 acres; the old inquest said that\r\n         it used not to contain more than 80; but afterwards the lands\r\n         were sought out and measured (_exquisitae sunt terrae et\r\n         mensuratae_).'\r\n\r\n  [1322] Cart. Rams. iii. 208. See also the table given by Seebohm,\r\n         op. cit. 37.\r\n\r\n  [1323] A 'double hide' of 240 acres plays a part in Mr Seebohm's\r\n         speculations. His instances of it hardly bear examination. On\r\n         p. 37 he produces from Rot. Hund. ii. 629 the equation 1 H.=6\r\n         V. of 40 A. apiece. This apparently refers to the Ramsey\r\n         manor of Brington; but Cart. Rams. ii. 43 gives 1 H.=4 V. of\r\n         40 A., while Cart. Rams. iii. 209 gives 1 H.=4 V. of 34 A.\r\n         Then Mr Seebohm, p. 51, cites from 'the documents of Battle\r\n         Abbey given by Dugdale' the equation 1 H.=8 V.; but this\r\n         seems to refer to the statement now printed in the Battle\r\n         Cartulary (Camd. Soc.) p. xiii., where 1 H.=4 V. As to the\r\n         supposed _solanda_ of two hides, see Round, Feudal England,\r\n         103.\r\n\r\n  [1324] The virgates on the Gloucestershire manors of Gloucester\r\n         Abbey contain the following numbers of acres: 36, 40, 36, 38,\r\n         48, 48, 48, 48, 50, 48, 40, 64, 64, 64, 48, 50, 60, 48, 48,\r\n         64, 18 (?), 44, 80, 48, 48, 72. See Gloucester Cartulary,\r\n         vol. iii. Of the taxation and wealth of the various counties\r\n         we shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n  [1325] Napier and Stevenson, Crawford Charters, p. 47: The O. E.\r\n         _sulh_ (plough) is 'cognate with Lat. _sulcus_.'\r\n\r\n  [1326] Both terms were in use in Normandy and some other parts of\r\n         France: Delisle, Études, 538; also Ducange. In a would-be\r\n         English charter of the days before the Conquest these words\r\n         would be ground for suspicion. In K. 283 and 455 Kemble has\r\n         printed (in documents which he stigmatizes) _caractorum_. But\r\n         apparently (see B. ii. 104, iii. 94) what stands in the\r\n         cartulary is _carattorum_, and this seems a mistake for the\r\n         common _casatorum_. To mistake O. E. _s_ for _r_ is easy.\r\n\r\n  [1327] See Stevenson, E. H. R. v. 143.\r\n\r\n  [1328] In D. B. the _iugum_ appears as a portion of a _solin_;\r\n         probably as a quarter of the solin. D. B. i. 13: 'pro uno\r\n         solin se defendit. Tria iuga sunt infra divisionem Hugonis et\r\n         quartum iugum est extra.' The _iugum_ has already appeared in\r\n         a few Kentish land-books. In K. 199 (i. 249), B. i. 476, we\r\n         find _an ioclet_ which seems to be half a manse\r\n         (_mansiuncula_). In K. 407 (iii. 262), B. ii. 572, we find\r\n         'an iuclæte et insuper 10 segetes (_acres_).'\r\n\r\n  [1329] D. B. ii. 389: 'In Cratingas 24 liberi homines 1 carr. terrae\r\n         et 1 virg.'\r\n\r\n  [1330] Yorkshire Inquisitions (Yorks. Archæeol. Soc.) passim. On p.\r\n         77 in an account of Catterick we read of 'a capital messuage\r\n         worth 5_s._; 32 bovates of arable land in demesne (each\r\n         bovate of 6 acres at 8_s._) £12. 16_s._; 31-1/2 bovates held\r\n         by bondmen (each bovate of 10 acres at 13_s._ 4_d._) £21; ...\r\n         2 bovates which contain 24 acres and 32 acres called Inland\r\n         worth 74_s._ 8_d._'\r\n\r\n  [1331] See above, p. 375.\r\n\r\n  [1332] A bovate of 13 acres seems to have prevailed in Scotland:\r\n         Acts of Parliament of Scotland, i. 387.\r\n\r\n  [1332] The immediate source is the Seneschaucie. See Walter of\r\n         Henley, ed. Lamond, p. 84. Fleta, p. 159.\r\n\r\n  [1334] Walter of Henley, pp. 6, 8, 44-5. With a three-course system\r\n         the figures will be somewhat different. Plough 60 acres for\r\n         winter seed, 60 for spring seed, 60 for fallow (total 180) at\r\n         the rate of 7/8th of an acre per day:--Total, 205-6/7 days.\r\n         In second fallowing plough 60 acres at an acre per\r\n         day:--Grand total, 265-5/7 days. Whichever system is adopted,\r\n         the plough 'goes' 240 acres.\r\n\r\n  [1335] Walter of Henley, p. 13.\r\n\r\n  [1336] Domesday of St. Paul's, 38.\r\n\r\n  [1337] Meitzen, op. cit. i. 277; Andrews, op. cit. 260.\r\n\r\n  [1338] Gerefa, 9 (Anglia, ix. 261): 'Me mæig in Maio and Junio and\r\n         Julio on sumera fealgian.' Andrews, op. cit. 257.\r\n\r\n  [1339] Thus e.g. Domesday of St. Paul's, 59, Tillingham. Is it\r\n         possible to fallow, when, as in this case, there is no\r\n         pasture for the oxen except such as is afforded by the idle\r\n         field? 'Non est ibi pastura nisi cum quiescit dominicum per\r\n         wainagium.... (69) Non est ibi certa pastura nisi quando\r\n         terrae dominici quiescunt alternatim incultae.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Domesday Statistics._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Domesday's three statements.]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the account given by Domesday Book of any manor\r\ncontains three different statements about it which seem to have some\r\nbearing upon the subject of our present inquiry. (_A_) It will tell us\r\nthat the manor is rated to the geld at a certain number of units, which\r\nunits will in Kent be solins or sulungs and yokes (_iuga_), in\r\nYorkshire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire,\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk carucates and bovates (but bovates are, to say the\r\nleast, rare in East Anglia), and in the rest of England hides and\r\nvirgates; but acres also will from time to time appear in the statement.\r\n(_B_) It will tell us that the manor contains land for a certain number\r\nof teams, or for a certain number of oxen. (_C_) It will tell us that\r\nthere are on the manor a certain number of teams, some whereof belong to\r\nthe lord and some to the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TABLE I.

habuit K [man's name] _a_ car[ucatas] terrae ad\r\n     geldum. Terra _b_ car[ucarum _or_ carucis]. Ibi nunc in dominio _d_\r\n     car[ucae] et ... villani et ... bordarii habent _e_ car[ucas].\r\n\r\nThe Lincolnshire formula is perhaps yet plainer. Instead of saying\r\n'Terra _b_ car[ucarum],' it says, 'Terra ad _b_ car[ucas].' Still more\r\ninstructive is a formula used in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n     In M habuit K _a_ car[ucatas] terrae ad geldum ubi possunt esse _b_\r\n     car[ucae]. Nunc habet ibi K _d_ car[ucas] et ... villanos et ...\r\n     bordarios cum _e_ car[ucis].\r\n\r\nAs a variant on the phrase 'ubi possunt esse _b_ car[ucae],' we have,\r\n'quas potest arare 1 car[uca],' or 'has possunt arare _b_\r\ncar[ucae][1340].'\r\n\r\nThe teams on the demesne (_d_) and the teams of the tenants (_e_) are\r\nenumerated separately. The total number of the teams (_d_ + _e_) we will\r\ncall _c_.\r\n\r\nNow occasionally we may find an entry concerning which the following\r\nequation will hold good: _a_ = _b_ = _c_: in other words, the same\r\nnumber will stand for the carucates at which the manor is taxed, the\r\n'teamlands' that there are in it (or to put it another way the number of\r\nteams that 'can be there,' or the number of teams that 'can plough\r\nit'[1341]) and also for the teams that are actually to be found there.\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n     Terra Roberti de Todeni.... In Ulestanestorp habuit Leuricus 4\r\n     car[ucatas] terrae ad geldum. Terra totidem car[ucis]. Ibi habet\r\n     Robertus in dominio 1 car[ucam] et 6 villanos et 3 bordarios et 8\r\n     sochemannos habentes 3 car[ucas][1342].\r\n\r\nHere _a_ = _b_ = _c_. But entries so neat as this are not very common.\r\nIn the first place, the number (_c_) of teams often exceeds or falls\r\nshort of the number (_b_) of 'teamlands,' or, which is the same thing,\r\nthe number of teams that there 'can be.' An excess of 'teamlands' over\r\nteams is common. In some parts of Yorkshire and elsewhere instead of\r\nreading that there are so many teams, we read 'modo vasta est':--there\r\nare no oxen there at all. But the reverse of this case is not very\r\nuncommon. Thus we may be told that there are 3 carucates for geld, that\r\n'there can be there 2 teams' and that there are 4 teams[1343]; we may\r\nfind a manor that contains land for but 3 teams equipped with as many as\r\n7[1344]. As to the relation between _a_ and _b_, this is not fixed. On\r\none and the same page we may find that _a_ is equal to, greater and less\r\nthan _b_. Thus in Lincolnshire[1345]:\r\n\r\n     In Colebi habuit Siuuard 7 car. terrae ad geldum. Terra ad totidem\r\n     car.\r\n\r\n     In Cherchebi habuit Comes Morcar 5 car. terrae ad geldum. Terra ad\r\n     4 car.\r\n\r\n     In Bodebi habuit Comes Morcar 8 car. terrae ad geldum. Terra ad 9\r\n     car.\r\n\r\n[Southern formulas.]\r\n\r\nLeaving now for a while the carucated part of England and postponing our\r\nvisit to Kent, we find similar formulas. They tell us (_A_) that the\r\nmanor contains a certain number of units of assessment, (_B_) that there\r\nis land for a certain number of teams, (_C_) that there are so many\r\nteams upon it. But we have a new set of units of assessment; instead of\r\ncarucates and bovates, we have hides and virgates. The Huntingdonshire\r\nformula is particularly clear. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n     In M habet K _a_ hidas ad geldum. Terra _b_ car[ucarum _or_\r\n     carucis]. Ibi nunc in dominio _d_ car[ucae] et ... villani et ...\r\n     bordarii habentes _e_ car[ucas].\r\n\r\nThe number of hides that is put before us is the number of hides 'for\r\ngeld.' So in Cheshire and Shropshire the number of hides that is put\r\nbefore us is the number of 'hidae geld[antes].' From this we easily pass\r\nto the formula that prevails in Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset and Devon:\r\n\r\n     K tenet M. T[empore] R[egis] E[dwardi] geldabat pro _a_ hidis.\r\n     Terra est _b_ car[ucarum]. In dominio sunt _d_ car[ucae] et ...\r\n     villani et ... bordarii cum _e_ car[ucis].\r\n\r\nA formula common in Sussex, Surrey and several other counties instead of\r\ntelling us that this manor has _a_ hides for geld, or has _a_ gelding\r\nhides, or gelds for _a_ hides, tells us--what seems exactly the same\r\nthing--that it 'defends itself' for _a_ hides. Then we pass to counties\r\nsuch as Middlesex, Hertford, Buckingham and Oxford where the entry does\r\nnot commonly use any words which explicitly refer to geld:--we are told\r\nthat K holds M for so many hides (pro _a_ hidis). Lastly, we may pass to\r\ncounties, such as Warwickshire and Staffordshire where, at first sight,\r\nthe entries may seem to us ambiguous. They run thus--'K holds M. There\r\nare there _a_ hides. There is land for _b_ teams.' Here for a moment it\r\nmay seem to us that we have two different statements about the actual\r\nextent or capacity of the manor:--there are _a_ hides there, but land\r\nfor _b_ teams. But comparing the formulas in use here with those in use\r\nin other counties, we can hardly doubt that they all come to one and the\r\nsame thing:--a statement about _b_, the capacity of the manor, is\r\npreceded by a statement about its taxation, which statement may take the\r\nshort form, 'There are _a_ hides there,' instead of one of the longer\r\nforms, 'It gelds, or defends itself, for _a_ hides,' or 'He holds _a_\r\ngelding hides, or _a_ hides for geld.'\r\n\r\n[Kentish formulas.]\r\n\r\nIn Kent again, we have the three statements, though here the units of\r\nassessment are sulungs and yokes:--the land 'defends itself' for _a_\r\nsulungs; there is land there for _b_ teams; there are _d_ teams in\r\ndemesne and the men have _e_ teams.\r\n\r\n[Relation between the three statements.]\r\n\r\nIn the hidated south, as in the carucated north, the relation between\r\nthe three amounts is not invariable. We may find that _a_ = _b_ = _c_.\r\nIt is common to find that _c_ is less than _b_, but occasionally it is\r\ngreater; on one and the same page we may find that _c_ is equal to, is\r\ngreater, is less than _b_. Then _a_ is often equal to _b_, often it is\r\nless than _b_, but sometimes it is greater. We have therefore three\r\nstatements about the manor, between which there is no necessary\r\nconnexion of any very simple kind.\r\n\r\nIt may look pedantic, but will be convenient if, by means of the letters\r\n_A_, _B_ and _C_, we try to keep distinctly before our minds 'the _A_\r\nstatement' about the units of assessment, 'the _B_ statement' about the\r\n'teamlands,' or teams for which 'there is land,' and 'the _C_ statement'\r\nabout the existing teams. We shall find hereafter that there are certain\r\ncounties in which we do not get all three statements, at least in any of\r\ntheir accustomed forms. In Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and\r\nHerefordshire we rarely get the _B_ statement. As to Essex, Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk, we seem at first sight to obtain _A_ and not _B_, or _B_ and\r\nnot _A_, while Leicestershire will require separate treatment.\r\n\r\n[Introduction of statistics.]\r\n\r\nNow if we are ever to understand these matters, it is necessary that we\r\nshould look at the whole of England. Far be it from us to say that\r\nmicroscopic labour spent upon one county or one hundred is wasted; often\r\nit is of the highest value; but such work is apt to engender theories\r\nwhich break down the moment they are carried outside the district in\r\nwhich they had their origin. Well would it be if the broad features of\r\nDomesday Book could be set out before us in a series of statistical\r\ntables. The task would be gigantic and could hardly be performed except\r\nby a body of men who had plenteous leisure and who would work together\r\nharmoniously. However, rather to suggest what might and some day must be\r\ndone, than to parade what has been done rapidly and badly, some figures\r\nhave been set forth above in two tables[1346]. That they are extremely\r\ninaccurate can not be doubtful, for he who compiled them had other\r\nthings to do and lacks many of the qualities which should be required of\r\na good counter of hides. For unmethodical habits and faulty arithmetic\r\nno excuse is possible; but it will be remembered that, as matters now\r\nstand, two men not unskilled in Domesday might add up the number of\r\nhides in a county and arrive at very different results, because they\r\nwould hold different opinions as to the meaning of certain formulas\r\nwhich are not uncommon. What is here set before the reader is intended\r\nto be no more than a distant approach towards the truth. It will serve\r\nits end if it states the sort of figures that would be obtained by\r\ncareful and leisurely computers, and therefore the sort of problems that\r\nhave to be solved[1347].\r\n\r\n[Explanation of statistics.]\r\n\r\n[Acreage.]\r\n\r\nWe must now explain our statistics. In Column I. we give the acreage of\r\nthe modern counties[1348]. A warning bracket will remind the reader that\r\nin the cases of Yorkshire, Cheshire and Rutland the modern does not\r\ncoincide even approximately with the ancient boundary. To Middlesex we\r\ngive a figure larger than that given by our statisticians, for they know\r\na county of London which has been formed at the expense of its\r\nneighbours[1349]. Many minor variations should be remembered by those\r\nwho would use Domesday Book for delicate purposes; for example, they\r\nmust call to mind the merger in circumambient shires of what were once\r\ndetached pieces of other counties. But of such niceties we can here take\r\nno account[1350].\r\n\r\n[Population.]\r\n\r\nIn Column II. we state the 'recorded population' as computed by Ellis.\r\nIn the cases of Dorset and Somerset we also state, and we sign with the\r\nletter _E_, the result of Eyton's labours. We must not forget that these\r\nfigures give us rather the number of tenants or occupiers than the\r\nnumber of human beings. Our readers must multiply them by four, five or\r\nsix, according to knowledge or taste, before the population of England\r\nwill be attained.\r\n\r\n[Danegeld.]\r\n\r\nIn Column III., for a reason that will become evident hereafter, we\r\nplace the amount of danegeld charged against the counties--charged\r\nagainst them, not actually paid by them[1351]--in the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century. The sources of these figures are the Pipe Rolls of 31\r\nHenry I. and 2 and 8 Henry II. In these accounts the amount charged\r\nagainst a county is approximately constant. Some of the variations are\r\nprobably due to a contemptuous treatment of small sums[1352]; but there\r\nare cases in which a sheriff seems to have been allowed to deduct £10 or\r\nso, without any recorded explanation[1353]. We choose the highest\r\nfigures when there is any discord between our three rolls. The danegeld\r\nwas being levied at the rate of two shillings on the hide, and\r\ntherefore, if we would find the number of geldant hides, we have to\r\nmultiply by ten the number of pounds that are set against the county.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hides, carucates, sulungs.]\r\n\r\nColumn IV. contains our estimate of _A_: in other words, of the number\r\nof hides, carucates or sulungs. As we are arguing for a large hide, we\r\nhave thought right in doubtful cases to lean in favour of inclusion\r\nrather than of exclusion. We count all hides, except those ascribed to\r\nthe shire's boroughs[1354], even though we are told that they have\r\n'never' gelded. Also, when a hide is mentioned, we count it, even though\r\nwe have a strong suspicion that the same hide is mentioned again on some\r\nother page. Especially in Sussex, where the rapes have recently been\r\nrearranged, this may make our figures too high[1355]. Then, again, we\r\nhave frankly begged important questions by assuming that in Domesday\r\nBook the following equations are correct.\r\n\r\n          1 Hide     = 4 Virgates = 120 Acres\r\n          1 Carucate = 8 Bovates  = 120 Acres\r\n          1 Sulung   = 4 Yokes    = 120 Acres.\r\n\r\nIn the counties with which we have dealt, except Norfolk and Essex\r\n(Suffolk we have left alone), acres are so rarely mentioned that the\r\nerror, if any, introduced by our hypothesis as to their relation to\r\nhides and carucates will be almost infinitesimal, and, even if we are\r\nwrong in supposing that the virgate is the quarter of a hide and that\r\nthe bovate is the eighth of a carucate, the vitiation of our results\r\nthat will be due to this blunder will but rarely be considerable[1356].\r\n\r\n[Reduced hidage.]\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere we may find some hides (carucates, sulungs) that do\r\nnot geld and many cases in which a tract now gelds for a smaller number\r\nof hides (carucates, sulungs) than that for which it formerly paid. In\r\nfour counties, however, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire, we see\r\nthat since William's advent there has, rightfully or wrongfully, been a\r\nlarge and generally distributed reduction in the tale of the gelding\r\nhides. In our Column V. we give a rough statement of the reduced\r\nnumber[1357]. In Cornwall we read of an assessment that prevailed in the\r\nConfessor's day and of a heavier assessment. The figures which speak of\r\nthis heavier assessment we place in our Column V[1358].\r\n\r\n[The teamlands.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass from _A_ to _B_. In Column VI. we set the number of\r\nteamlands, thus answering the question _Quot carucarum [carucis] ibi est\r\nterra_. We have assumed, but this rarely has an appreciable effect on\r\nour calculations, that the land of one ox is the eighth, the land of two\r\noxen the fourth part of the land of one team. There are certain counties\r\nwhere we receive no statement about the teamlands, while in certain\r\nothers the statement, though it seems to be expected, is often\r\nomitted[1359]. For this reason some blanks will be found in this column.\r\nIn most of the other counties instances occur with more or less\r\nfrequency in which nothing is said of the teamlands. In these cases we\r\nhave thought it fair to assume that there were teamlands equal in number\r\nto the teams (_B_ = _C_). The effect of this assumption will be to bring\r\nthe number of teamlands (_B_) somewhat closer to the number of teams\r\n(_C_) than it would otherwise have been, but no very great harm will\r\nhave thus been done to our rude statistics[1360].\r\n\r\n[The teams.]\r\n\r\nColumn VII. gives the number of teams. Here we assume (we shall\r\nendeavour to prove hereafter) that the _caruca_ of Domesday Book always\r\nmeans the same, namely, eight oxen[1361].\r\n\r\n[The values.]\r\n\r\nLastly in Column VIII. we place the results attained by Pearson[1362]\r\nand Eyton in their endeavours to add together the various sums which the\r\nvarious estates in a shire are said to be worth (_valet_) or to render\r\n(_reddit_) in the Conqueror's day, and to thus obtain a total _valet_\r\nfor the shire. We need hardly say that these values are 'annual values.'\r\n\r\n[The table of ratios.]\r\n\r\nThe relations between our divers sets of figures are more important than\r\nthe figures themselves, therefore we have worked the division sums the\r\nresults of which are printed in the second Table, the first seven\r\ncolumns whereof are filled by quotients[1363]. The last column calls for\r\nmore remark. The _valets_ obtained for the various counties by Pearson\r\nand Eyton are somewhat precarious. They involve theories as to the\r\nrelation between the values of gold and silver, as to the relation\r\nbetween the value of a pound reckoned by tale and a pound reckoned by\r\nweight, as to 'blanched' money and the cost of 'a night's farm.' Also a\r\ngood deal is included that can hardly be called the value of land, since\r\nit comprehends, not only the value of mills and the like, but also in\r\nsome cases the revenue derived from courts. In order therefore that we\r\nmight compare the values given to land in the various counties, we have\r\ntaken at hazard a number of small estates in order that we might by\r\naddition and division obtain the value of a typical teamland with\r\ntypical appurtenances. In general we have chosen ten estates each of\r\nwhich has one teamland, ten estates each of which has two teamlands and\r\nten estates each of which has five teamlands, and then we have divided\r\nthe sum of their values by eighty, the number of teamlands that they\r\ncomprise. On the whole, the figures that we thus obtain and place in\r\nColumn XVI. are not widely removed from those in Column XV., which\r\nrepresent the quotients arising from a division of Pearson's 'county\r\nvalues' by the number of teamlands that are contained in the\r\ncounties[1364].\r\n\r\n[An apology.]\r\n\r\nIn order that not too much credence and yet just credence enough may be\r\ngiven to the figures that we have hastily put together, we will set\r\nbeside those that we have stated for Gloucestershire the results of a\r\nminute analysis accomplished by Mr Charles Taylor[1365]. We have set\r\ndown: _Population_, 8366 (from Ellis); _Hides_, 2388; _Teams_, 3768;\r\n_Total Valet_, £2827 6_s._ 8_d._ (from Pearson). Mr Taylor gives:\r\n_Population_, 8239[1366]; _Hides_, 2611 (or 2596); _Teams_, 3909; _Total\r\nValet_, £3130 7_s._ 10_d._ Now these variations are wide and may in some\r\nsort be discreditable to those who differ from Mr Taylor[1367]. But they\r\nare not very substantial if we come to averages and ratios and a\r\ncomparison of counties. For the purposes for which we shall use our\r\nfigures, it is no great matter whether in this county there are 2·1 or\r\n2·2 'recorded men' to the plough-team[1368]. The broad features of\r\nGloucestershire are that its hides fall far short of its teams, that its\r\nrecorded population is sparse, that the average value of the land\r\ntilled by a team falls well below twenty shillings, that this shire\r\ndiffers markedly and in certain assignable respects from Wiltshire,\r\nwhere the hides exceed the teams, from Lincoln, where, despite the fen,\r\nthe population is thick, from Kent, where the average value of land\r\ntilled by a team rises above thirty shillings[1369].\r\n\r\n[Constancy of ratios.]\r\n\r\nOur figures tell of wide variations; but we may be allowed to call\r\nattention to the stability of certain ratios, a stability which is\r\ngratifying to the diffident arithmetician. In twenty-one counties we can\r\ndivide 'the recorded population' by the number of teamlands. The\r\nquotient never falls as low as 2 and only twice exceeds 4[1370]. For the\r\nsame twenty-one counties we can divide the number of teamlands by the\r\nnumber of teams. Only twice will the quotient fall below 1 and only once\r\nwill it touch 2. We must not, however, be led away into a general\r\ndiscussion of these figures. That task would require a wary and learned\r\neconomist. We must keep our minds bent on what may be called the _A B C_\r\nof our subject[1371].\r\n\r\n[The team.]\r\n\r\nNow we may start with what seems to be the most objective of our three\r\nstatements, that which gives us _C_, the number of teams. We know that\r\nin _A_ there is an element of estimation, of assessment; we may fear\r\nthat this is true of _B_ also; but an ox or a team ought to be a fact\r\nand not a theory. At the outset, however, a troublesome question\r\narises. We have assumed that whenever our record speaks of a _caruca_ it\r\nmeans eight oxen. On the other hand, there are who maintain that whereas\r\nthe _carucae_ of the demesne consisted of eight, those ascribed to the\r\nvilleins comprised but four oxen[1372], and others have thought that the\r\nstrength of Domesday's _caruca_ varied from place to place with the\r\nvarying practice of divers agriculturists.\r\n\r\n[Variability of the _caruca_.]\r\n\r\nBut, in the first place, it is abundantly clear that the clerk who\r\ncompiled the account of Cambridgeshire from the original verdicts held\r\nhimself at liberty to substitute 'half a team' for 'four oxen' and 'four\r\noxen' for 'half a team[1373].' In the second place, the theory of a\r\nvariable _caruca_ would in our eyes reduce to an absurdity the practice\r\nof stating the capacity of land in terms of the teams and the oxen that\r\ncan plough it. We are carefully told about each estate that 'there is\r\nland for _b_ teams, or for _b´_ oxen, or for _b_ teams and _b´_ oxen.'\r\nNow if a 'team' has always the same meaning, we have here a valuable\r\ntruth. If, on the other hand, a 'team' may mean eight or may mean four\r\noxen, we are being told next to nothing. The apparently precise 'there\r\nis land for 4 teams' becomes the useless 'there is land for 32 or 16 or\r\nfor some number between 32 and 16 oxen.' What could the statesmen, who\r\nwere hoping to correct the assessment of the danegeld, make of so vague\r\na statement? They propose to work sums in teams and teamlands. They\r\nspend immense pains in ascertaining that here there is 'land for half a\r\nteam' or 'land for half an ox.' We are accusing them of laborious folly\r\nunless we suppose that they can at a moment's notice convert teams into\r\noxen.\r\n\r\n[The _caruca_ a constant.]\r\n\r\nIf it be allowed that in the statement (_B_) about the number of\r\nteamlands the term caruca has always the same meaning, we cannot stop\r\nthere, but must believe that in the statement (_C_) about the number of\r\nteams this same meaning is retained. Often enough when there is equality\r\nbetween teamlands and teams (_C = B_), the entry takes the following\r\nform:--There is land for _b_ teams and 'they' are there[1374]. What are\r\nthere? The teams for which 'there is land': those teams which are\r\nserving as a measure for the capacity of land. Let us try the two modes\r\nof interpretation on the first lines that strike our eye. Here we have\r\ntwo successive entries, each of which tells us that 'there is land for 6\r\nteams[1375].' If the _caruca_ is a constant, we have learnt that in one\r\nparticular there is equality between these estates. If the _caruca_ is a\r\nvariable, we have learnt nothing of the kind. Let us see what we can\r\ngain by reading further. In the one case there were 3 teams on the\r\ndemesne and the villeins had 6-1/2; in the other there were 2 teams on\r\nthe demesne, the villeins had 2 and the sokemen 2. We want to know\r\nwhether the second of these estates is under-teamed or over-teamed.\r\nThere is land for 6 teams and there are 6 teams on it; but 2 of these\r\nteams belong to villeins and 2 to sokemen. If we give the villeins but 4\r\noxen to the team, how many shall we give the sokemen? Shall we say 6? If\r\nso, there are 36 oxen here. Is that too many or too few or just enough\r\nfor the arable land that there is? That is an unanswerable question, for\r\nthe king's commissioners have been content with the statement that the\r\nnumber of oxen appropriate to this estate lies somewhere between 23 and\r\n49.\r\n\r\n[The villeins' teams.]\r\n\r\nSurely when we are told that 8 sokemen have '2 teams and 6 oxen' or that\r\n9 sokemen and 5 bordiers have '3 teams and 7 oxen[1376],' we are being\r\ntold that the teams in question have no less than eight oxen apiece.\r\nSurely when we are told that there are 23 villeins and 5 bordiers with 2\r\nteams and 5 oxen[1377], we are being told that the teams of these\r\nvilleins are not teams of four. And what are we to say of cases in which\r\na certain number of teams is ascribed to a number of persons who belong\r\nto various classes, as for example when 6 villeins and 7 bordiers and 2\r\nsokemen are said to have 3 teams and 5 oxen[1378], or where 3 villeins,\r\n2 bordiers, a priest and a huntsman are said to have one team and 6\r\noxen[1379], or where 19 radknights 'with their men' are said to have 48\r\nteams[1380]? Even if we suppose that the officers of the exchequer have\r\ntables which tell them how many oxen a _caruca_ implies when it is\r\nattributed to a Northamptonshire sokeman or a Gloucestershire radknight,\r\nwe are still setting before them insoluble problems. The radknights of\r\nBerkeley 'with their men' have 48 teams:--this may cover less than 200\r\nor more than 300 oxen. And yet the record that is guilty of this laxity\r\nwill tell us how in Bedfordshire _Terra est dimidio bovi, et ibi est\r\nsemibos_[1381].\r\n\r\n[The villeins' oxen.]\r\n\r\nThe main argument that has been urged in favour of a variable _caruca_\r\nis that which, basing itself on later documents, protests that a villein\r\nought not to have more than two oxen[1382]. Now true it seems to be that\r\nif by the number of the teams belonging to the _villani_ and _bordarii_\r\nof Domesday Book we divide the number of _villani_ plus half the number\r\nof _bordarii_ (and this would be a fair procedure), we shall obtain as\r\nour quotient a figure that will be much nearer to 2 than to 4. But it\r\nmust be common ground to all who read our record that some villeins are\r\nmuch better supplied with oxen than are their neighbours, and that some\r\nvilleins have whole teams, whatever a 'team' may mean. There is so much\r\ndifference in this respect between manor and manor that we are not\r\njustified in talking of any particular number of oxen as the normal\r\noutfit of the _villanus_, and outside of Domesday Book we have far too\r\nlittle evidence to sanction the dogma that the average number must stand\r\nclose to 2[1383]. Even the villein virgater on the monastic manors of\r\nthe thirteenth century is often expected to have four oxen, and his\r\nhaving eight is a possibility that must be contemplated[1384].\r\n\r\n[Light and heavy ploughs.]\r\n\r\nThat light as well as heavy ploughs were in use we have not denied. At a\r\nlittle later time we see teams of six beasts and teams of ten engaged in\r\nploughing. But the compilers of Domesday Book are not concerned with the\r\nmethods of husbandry; they are registering the number of oxen. If a man\r\nhas one ox which is employed as a beast of the plough, they say of him:\r\n_Arat cum uno bove_[1385]. If he and another man have such an ox between\r\nthem, they say: _Ibi est semibos_. If he has four oxen, they set this\r\ndown as _dimidia caruca_. Instead of telling us that there are\r\nthirty-eight oxen, they speak of five teams less two oxen[1386]. Twelve\r\npence make a shilling; and, at all events at the Exchequer, eight oxen\r\nmake a team.\r\n\r\n[The team of Domesday and other documents.]\r\n\r\nVery lately an argument has been advanced in favour of a _caruca_, the\r\nstrength of which varies from place to place. In many instances the\r\nBlack Book of Peterborough in its description of the abbatial estates\r\nwill give to the demesne of a particular manor exactly the same number\r\nof teams that are ascribed to it by Domesday Book, and, while in some\r\ncases the later of these documents will tell us that there are eight\r\noxen to the team, in others it will speak of teams of six[1387]. That\r\nthere is force in this argument we must admit; but many changes will\r\ntake place in forty years, and we can not think that the correspondence\r\nbetween the two documents is sufficiently close to warrant the inference\r\nthat the _caruca_ of Domesday can have fewer beasts than eight. An\r\nexactly parallel argument would serve to prove that the hide of Domesday\r\ncontains a variable number of fiscal 'acres.' Were it possible (but we\r\nshall see that it is not) for us to regard the teamland of Domesday as a\r\nfixed area, then we might afford to allow the strength of the team to\r\nvary; but if the teamland is no fixed area and the team has no fixed\r\nstrength, then King William's inquest ends in a collection of unknown\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n[The teamland.]\r\n\r\nWe turn from the team (_C_) to the teamland (_B_), and must face some\r\nperplexing questions. Reluctantly we have come to the opinion that this\r\nterm 'the land of (or for) one team' does not in the first instance\r\ndenote a fixed areal quantity of arable land. We have adopted this\r\nopinion reluctantly because we are differing from some of the best\r\nexpositors of our record, and because it compels us to say that many of\r\nthe statistical data with which that record provides us are not so\r\nuseful as we hoped that they would be.\r\n\r\n[Fractional parts of the teamland.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we must notice that if this term stands for a fixed\r\nquantity, a very rude use is being made of it. We see indeed that\r\nfractional parts of a teamland can be conceived. We often meet the land\r\nof (or for) half a team; we may come upon the land of or for two oxen,\r\none ox, half an ox. But, except in a few counties, any mention of\r\nfractions smaller than the half of a team is rare, and even halves\r\nseldom occur. Now certainly the teamland was a large unit for such\r\ntreatment as this. If, for instance, we suppose that it contained 120\r\nacres, then we must infer that in some shires the jurors who had to\r\ndescribe a mass of 420 acres would have called it land for 3 or else\r\nland for 4 teams, and that in most shires an odd 80 acres would have\r\nbeen neglected or would have done duty as half a teamland. The hides or\r\nthe carucates (_A_) have often been split into small fractions where the\r\njurors distribute integral teamlands. One example of this common\r\nphenomenon shall be given. In Grantchester lie six estates[1388]:\r\n\r\n     the first rated at 3 v. has land for 1 team,\r\n     the second rated at 2 h. 3 v. has land for 6 teams,\r\n     the third rated at 2 h. 3 v. has land for 4 teams,\r\n     the fourth rated at 1-1/2 v. has land for 1 team,\r\n     the fifth rated at 1 v. has land for 4 oxen,\r\n     the sixth rated at 1/2 v. has land for 3 oxen.\r\n\r\nThe teamland does not break up easily. As a general rule, we only hear\r\nof fractional parts of it when the jurors are compelled to deal with a\r\ntenement so small that it can not be said to possess even one\r\nteamland[1389].\r\n\r\n[Land for oxen and wood for swine.]\r\n\r\nIn passing we observe that this phrase, 'There is land for _x_ teams'\r\nfinds exact parallels in two other phrases that are not very uncommon,\r\nnamely, 'There is pasture for _y_ sheep' and 'There is wood for _z_\r\npigs': also that the values given to _y_ and _z_ are often large and\r\nround. It may be that the jurors have in their minds equations which\r\nconnect the area of a wood or pasture with its power of feeding swine or\r\nsheep, but an extremely lax use must be made of these equations when the\r\nnumber of sheep is fixed at a neat hundred or the number of pigs at a\r\nneat thousand, nor dare we say that the quality of the grass and trees\r\nhas no influence upon the computation.\r\n\r\n[Teamland no areal unit.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, we observe that the teamland when it does break into\r\nfractional parts does not break into virgates, bovates, acres, roods, or\r\nany other units which we can regard as units in a scheme of areal\r\nmeasurement[1390]. The eighth of a teamland is the land of (or for) an\r\nox. If we wish to speak of the sixteenth of a teamland, we must\r\nintroduce the half-ox. Now had the jurors been told to state the\r\nquantity of the arable land comprised in a tenement, they had at their\r\ncommand plenty of words which would have served this purpose. No sooner\r\nwill they have told us that there is land for two teams, than they will\r\nadd that there are five acres of meadow and a wood which is three\r\nfurlongs in length by two in breadth. We infer that they have not been\r\nasked to state the area of the arable. They have been asked to say\r\nsomething about it, but not to state its area.\r\n\r\n[The commissioners and the teamlands.]\r\n\r\nWhat had they been asked to say? Here we naturally turn to that\r\nwell-known introduction to the Inquisitio Eliensis which professes to\r\ndescribe the procedure of the commissioners and which at many points\r\ncorresponds with the contents of Domesday Book[1391]. We read that the\r\nbarons made inquiry about the number of the hides (_A_) and the number\r\nof the teams (_C_); we do not read any word about the teamlands (_B_).\r\n_Quot hidae_ they must ask; _Quot carucae[1392] in dominio et quot\r\nhominum_ they must ask; _Quot carucis ibi est terra_--there is no such\r\nquestion. On the other hand, the jurors are told to give all the\r\nparticulars thrice over (_hoc totum tripliciter_), once with reference\r\nto King Edward's day, once with reference to the date when the Conqueror\r\nbestowed the manor, and once with reference to the present time.\r\n\r\n[The teamlands of Great Domesday.]\r\n\r\nNow, if these be the interrogatories that the justiciars administered to\r\nthe jurors, then the answering verdicts as they are recorded in Great\r\nDomesday err both by defect and by excess. On the one hand, save when\r\nthey are dealing with the geld or the value of a tenement, they rarely\r\ngive any figures from King Edward's day, and still seldomer do they\r\nspeak about the date of the Conqueror's feoffments. Our record does not\r\nsystematically report that whereas there are now four teams on this\r\nmanor, there were five in the Confessor's reign and three when its new\r\nlord received it. On the other hand, we obtain the apparently unasked\r\nfor information that 'there is land for five teams.'\r\n\r\n[The teams of Little Domesday.]\r\n\r\nWe turn to Little Domesday and all is altered. Here the words of the\r\nwrit seem to be punctually obeyed. The particulars are stated three\r\ntimes over, the words _tunc_, _post_ and _modo_ pointing to the three\r\nperiods. Thus we learn how many teams there were when Edward was living\r\nand when the Conqueror gave the land away. On the other hand, we are not\r\ntold how many teams 'could till' that land, though if the existing teams\r\nare fewer than those that were ploughing in time past, it will sometimes\r\nbe remarked that the old state of things could be 'restored[1393]'.\r\n\r\n[The Leicestershire formulas.]\r\n\r\nNext we visit Leicestershire. We may open our book at a page which will\r\nmake us think that the account of this shire will be very similar to\r\nthose reports that are typical of Great Domesday. We read that Ralph\r\nholds four carucates; that there is land for four teams; that there are\r\ntwo teams on the demesne while the villeins have two[1394]. But then,\r\nalternating with entries which run in this accustomed form, we find\r\nothers which, instead of telling us that there is land for so many\r\nteams, will tell us that there were so many upon it in the time of King\r\nEdward[1395]. Perhaps, were this part of the survey explored by one\r\nhaving the requisite knowledge, he would teach us that the jurors of\r\nsome wapentakes use the one formula while the other is peculiar to other\r\nwapentakes; but, as the record stands, the variation seems due to the\r\ncompiling clerk. Be that as it may, we can hardly read through these\r\nLeicestershire entries without being driven to believe that\r\nsubstantially the same piece of information is being conveyed to us now\r\nin one and now in the other of two shapes that in our eyes are\r\ndissimilar. To say, 'There were four teams here in King Edward's day' is\r\nmuch the same as to say, 'There is land here for four teams.'\r\nConversely, to say, 'There is land here for four teams' is much the same\r\nas to say,'There were four teams here in King Edward's day.' For an\r\nexact equivalence we must not contend; but if the commissioners get the\r\none piece of information they do not want the other. On no single\r\noccasion, unless we are mistaken, are both put on record[1396].\r\n\r\n[Origin of the inquiry about the teamlands.]\r\n\r\nWhen we have thought over these things, we shall perhaps fashion for\r\nourselves some such guess as that which follows. The original scheme of\r\nthe Inquest was unnecessarily cumbrous. The design of collecting the\r\nstatistics of the past broke down. Let us imagine a similar attempt made\r\nin our own day. Local juries are summoned to swear communal verdicts\r\nabout the number of horses and oxen that the farmers were keeping twenty\r\nyears ago. Roughly, very roughly true would such verdicts be, although\r\nno foreign invasion, no influx of alien men and words and manners\r\ndivides us from the fortieth year of Queen Victoria. In Essex, Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk some sort of answer about these matters was extracted from\r\nthe jurors; but frequently they report that the arrangements which exist\r\nnow have always existed, and by this they mean that they cannot remember\r\nany change. Now, when we fail to find in Great Domesday any similar\r\nfigures, we may ascribe this to one of two causes. Either the\r\ncommissioners did not collect statistics, or the compilers did not think\r\nthem worthy of preservation. In some cases the one supposition may be\r\ntrue, in other cases the other. We may be fairly certain that in many or\r\nall counties the horses and the pigs and the 'otiose animals' that were\r\nextant in 1086 were enumerated in the verdicts[1397]. Also we know that\r\nDomesday Book is no mere transcript, but is an abstract or digest, and\r\nwe have cause for believing that those who made it held themselves free\r\nto vary the phrases used by the jurors, provided that no material change\r\nwas thus introduced[1398]. Howbeit, to come to the question that is\r\nimmediately before us, our evidence seems to tell us that the\r\ncommissioners and their master discovered that the original programme of\r\nthe inquest was unnecessarily cumbrous. Once and again in more recent\r\ndays has a similar discovery been made by royal commissioners. So some\r\ninterrogatories were dropped.\r\n\r\n[Modification of the inquiry.]\r\n\r\nThen we suspect that the inquiry about the number of oxen that were\r\nploughing in Edward's day became a more practicable, if looser, inquiry\r\nabout the number of oxen capable of tilling the land. The transition\r\nwould not be difficult. What King William really wants to know is the\r\nagricultural capacity of the tenement. He learns that there are now upon\r\nit so many beasts of the plough. But this number may be accidentally\r\nlarge or accidentally small. With an eye to future taxation, he wishes\r\nfor figures expressive of the normal condition of things. But, according\r\nto the dominant idea of his reign, the normal condition of things is\r\ntheir Edwardian condition, that in which they stood before the usurper\r\ndeforced the rightful heir. And so these two formulas which we see\r\nalternating in the account of Leicestershire really do mean much the\r\nsame thing: 'There is land for _x_ teams': 'There were _x_ teams in the\r\ntime of King Edward.'\r\n\r\n[Inquiry as to potential teams.]\r\n\r\nBut if we suppose the justices abandoning the question 'How many teams\r\ntwenty years ago?' in favour of 'How many teams can there be?' we see\r\nthat, though they are easing their task and enabling themselves to\r\nobtain answers in the place of silence, they are also substituting for a\r\nmatter of pure fact what may easily become a matter of opinion. They\r\nhave left the actual behind and are inquiring about potentialities. They\r\nwill now get answers more speedily; but who eight centuries afterwards\r\nwill be able to analyze the mental processes of which these answers are\r\nthe upshot? It is possible that a jury sets to work with an equation\r\nwhich connects oxen with area, for example, one which tells that a team\r\ncan plough 120 acres. It is but too possible that this equation varies\r\nfrom place to place and that the commissioners do not try to prevent\r\nvariations. They are not asking about area; they are asking about the\r\nnumber of teams requisite for the tillage of the tenement. With this and\r\nits value as data, William's ministers hope to correct the antiquated\r\nassessments. Some of the commissioners may allow the jurors to take the\r\ncustom of the district as a guide, while others would like to force one\r\nequation on the whole country. Our admiration for Domesday Book will be\r\nincreased, not diminished, if we remember that it is the work not of\r\nmachines but of men. Some of the justices seem to have thought that the\r\ninquiry about potential teams (_B_) was not of the first importance, not\r\nnearly so important as the inquiries about actual teams (_C_) and\r\ngelding units (_A_). In various counties we see many entries in which\r\n_Terra est_ is followed by a blank space. In Gloucester, Worcester and\r\nHereford we find no systematic mention of teamlands, but only occasional\r\nreports which show that at certain places there might be more teams than\r\nthere are. At the end of the account of the Bishop of Worcester's triple\r\nhundred of Oswaldslaw (an account so favourable to St. Mary that it\r\nmight have been dictated by her representative) we find the remark that\r\nin none of these manors could there be any more teams than now are\r\nthere[1399]. The bishop, who fully understands the object of the\r\ninquest, does not mean to have his assessment raised, and the justices\r\nare compelled to take the word of jurors every one of whom is the vassal\r\nof St. Mary.\r\n\r\n[Normal relation between teams and teamlands.]\r\n\r\nWe know so little as to the commissioners' intentions, in particular so\r\nlittle as to any design on their part to force upon the whole country\r\nsome one equation connecting oxen with area, that the task which is set\r\nbefore us if we would explain the relation between the number of the\r\nteams (_C_) and the number of the teamlands (_B_) that we find in a\r\ngiven county is sometimes an intricate and perhaps insoluble problem. If\r\nEngland be taken as a whole, the two numbers will stand very close to\r\neach other. In some counties, for example in Lincolnshire, if at the\r\nfoot of each page we add up the particulars, we shall long remain in\r\ndoubt whether _B_ or _C_ will be the greater when our final sum is made.\r\nIn county after county we shall find a large number of entries in which\r\n_B = C_, and, though there will always be some cases in which, the\r\ntenement being waste, _C_ descends to zero, and others in which _C_ is\r\nless than _B_, still the deficiency will be partially redressed by\r\ninstances in which _B_ falls short of _C_. On the whole, the relation\r\nbetween the two is that which we might expect. Often there is equality;\r\noften the variation is small; but an excess on the part of _B_ is\r\ncommoner than an excess on the part of _C_, and when the waste teamlands\r\nhave been brought into the account, then in most counties _B_ will\r\nusually exceed _C_ by 10 per cent, or little more. There are, however,\r\nsome marked and perplexing exceptions to this rule[1400].\r\n\r\n[Deficiency of teams in the south-west.]\r\n\r\nAs we pass through the southern counties from east to west, the ratio\r\nborne by the teamlands to the teams steadily increases, until ascending\r\nby leaps it reaches 1.43:1 (or thereabouts) in Devon and 2:1 in\r\nCornwall. Now to all seeming we are not in a country which has recently\r\nbeen devastated; it is not like Yorkshire; we find no large number of\r\n'waste' or unpopulated or unvalued estates. Here and there we may see a\r\ntenement which has as many teams as it has teamlands; but in the great\r\nmajority of cases the preponderance of teamlands is steadily maintained.\r\nWhat does this mean? One conceivable explanation we may decidedly\r\nreject. It does not mean a relatively scientific agriculture which makes\r\nthe most of the ox. Nor does it mean a fertile soil[1401]. Our figures\r\nseem to show that men are sparse and poor; also they are servile. We\r\nsuspect their tillage to be of that backward kind which ploughs enormous\r\ntracts for a poor return. _Arva per annos mutant et superest ager._ Of\r\nthe whole of the land that is sometimes ploughed, they sow less than\r\ntwo-thirds or a half in any one year: perhaps they sow one-third only,\r\nso that of the space which the royal commissioners reckon as three\r\nteamlands two-thirds are always idle. We must remember that in modern\r\ntimes the husbandry that prevailed in Cornwall was radically different\r\nfrom that which governed the English open fields. It was what the\r\nagrarian historians of Germany call a _Feldgrasswirtschaft_[1402]. That\r\nperhaps is the best explanation which we can give of this general and\r\nnormal excess of teamlands over teams. But to this we may add that\r\nsystems of mensuration and assessment which fitted the greater part of\r\nEngland very well, may have fitted Devon, Cornwall and some other\r\nwestern counties very badly[1403]. Those systems are the outcome of\r\nvillages and spacious common fields where, without measurement, you\r\ncount the 'acres' and the plough-lands or house-lands, and they refuse\r\nto register with any accuracy the arrangements of the Celtic hamlets, or\r\nrather _trevs_ of the west.\r\n\r\n[Actual and potential teamlands.]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means impossible that when the commissioners came to a\r\ncounty which was very sparsely peopled (and in Cornwall each 'recorded\r\nman' might have had near 160 acres of some sort or another all to\r\nhimself) their question about the number of teamlands or about the\r\nnumber of teams 'that could plough there' became a question about remote\r\npossibilities, rather than about existing or probable arrangements, and\r\nthat the answer to it became mere guesswork. On one occasion in Cornwall\r\nthey are content with the statement that there is land for 'fifteen or\r\nthirty teams[1404].' In the description of a wasted tract of\r\nStaffordshire we see six cases close together in which two different\r\nguesses as to the number of the potential teamlands are\r\nrecorded[1405]:--'There is land for two teams', but 'or three' is\r\ninterlined. Five times 'or two' is written above 'one,' Now this is of\r\nimportance, for perhaps we may see in it the key to the treatment that\r\nwasted Yorkshire receives. How much arable land is there in this\r\nvillage? Well, if by 'arable land' you mean land that is ploughed, there\r\nis none. If you do not mean this, if you are speaking of a 'waste' vill\r\nwhere no land has been ploughed these fifteen years, then you must be\r\ncontent with a speculative answer[1406]. If the ruined cottages were\r\nrebuilt and inhabited, if oxen and men were imported, then employment\r\nmight be found for four or five teams. Called to speculate about these\r\nmatters, the Yorkshire jurors very naturally catch hold of any solid\r\nfact which may serve as a base for computations. This fact they seem to\r\nfind in the geld assessment. This estate is rated to the geld at two\r\ncarucates; the assessment seems tolerably fair; so they say that two\r\nteams would plough the land. Or again, this estate is rated to the geld\r\nat four carucates; but its assessment is certainly too high, so let it\r\nbe set down for two teamlands[1407]. Even in other parts of the country\r\nthe jurors may sometimes avail themselves of this device. In particular\r\nthere are tracts in which they are fond of reporting that the number of\r\nteamlands is just equal to (_B=A_) or just twice as great (_B=2A_) as\r\nthe number of gelding carucates. We very much fear, though the ground\r\nfor this fear can not be explained at this stage of our inquiry, that\r\nthe figure which the jurors state when questioned about potential teams\r\nis sometimes dictated by a traditional estimate which has been playing a\r\npart in the geld assessment, and that the number of teamlands is but\r\nremotely connected with the agrarian arrangements of 1086. All our other\r\nguesses therefore must be regarded as being subject to this horrible\r\nsuspicion, of which we shall have more to say hereafter[1408].\r\n\r\n[The land of excessive teams.]\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult for us to construe the second great aberration\r\nfrom the general rule that the number of the teamlands in a county will\r\nslightly exceed the number of teams. In Derby and Nottingham apparent\r\n'understocking' becomes the exception and 'overstocking' the rule. In\r\nDerby there is a good deal of 'waste' where we have to reckon teamlands\r\nbut no teams, and yet on many pages the number of teams is the greater\r\n(_C>B_). In Nottingham there seem to be on the average near 200 teams\r\nwhere there are but 125 teamlands. In many columns of the Lincolnshire\r\nsurvey, and therefore perhaps in some districts of that large and\r\nvariegated county, the teams have a majority, though, if we have not\r\nblundered, they are beaten by the teamlands when the whole shire has\r\nbeen surveyed. It is very possible that a similar phenomenon would have\r\nbeen recorded in Essex and East Anglia if the inquiry in those counties\r\nhad taken the form that was usual elsewhere, for the teams seem to be\r\nthick on the land. Now to interpret the steady excess of teams that we\r\nsee in Derby and Nottingham is not easy. We can hardly suppose that the\r\njurors are confessing that they habitually employ a superfluity of oxen.\r\nPerhaps, however, we may infer that in this district a given area of\r\nland will be ploughed by an unusually large number of teams, whereas in\r\nDevon and Cornwall a given area will be ploughed, though intermittently,\r\nby an unusually small number. In every way the contrast between Devon\r\nand Cornwall on the one hand, Lincoln, Nottingham and Derby on the\r\nother, is strongly marked. Of the quality of soils something should, no\r\ndoubt, be said which we are too ignorant to say. An acre would yield\r\nmore corn in Nottingham and Derby, to say nothing of Lincoln, than in\r\nDevon and Cornwall, though the _valets_ that we find in the three Danish\r\nshires are by no means so high as those that are displayed by some of\r\nthe southern counties. But if we ask how many households our average\r\nteamland is supporting, then among all the counties that we have\r\nexamined Lincoln, Nottingham and Derby stand at the very top, while\r\nDevon and Cornwall stand with the depopulated Stafford at the very\r\nbottom of the list[1409]. Then, again, we see the contrasts between\r\nvillage and _trev_, between Dane and Celt, between sokeman and slave.\r\nPossibly Northampton, Derby and parts of Lincoln really are\r\n'over-teamed': that is to say, were the land of these counties to come\r\nto the hands of lords who held large and compact estates, the number of\r\nplough-teams would be reduced. Where there is freedom there will be some\r\nwaste. The tenements split into fractions, and the owner of a small\r\npiece must keep oxen enough to draw a plough or trust to the\r\nfriendliness and reciprocal needs of his neighbours. Manorialism has\r\nthis advantage: it can make the most of the ox. Another possible guess\r\nis that the real carucates and bovates of this district (by which we\r\nmean the units which locally bear these names and which are the units in\r\nthe proprietary or tenurial scheme) have few acres, fewer than would be\r\nallowed by some equation which the royal commissioners for these\r\ncounties carry in their minds. Being assured (for example) that the\r\nbovates in a certain village or hundred have few acres, they may be\r\nallowing the jurors to count as three team-lands ('of imperial\r\nmeasure') a space of arable that has been locally treated as four. So,\r\nafter all, the rule that normally each teamland should have its team and\r\nthat each team should till its teamland may be holding good in these\r\ncounties, though the proprietary and agrarian units have differed from\r\nthose that the commissioners treat as orthodox.\r\n\r\n[Attempts to explain the excess of teams.]\r\n\r\nOne last guess is lawful after what we have seen in Leicestershire.\r\nThese Nottinghamshire folk may be telling how many teams there were in\r\nKing Edward's time and recording a large increase in the number of oxen\r\nand therefore perhaps in the cultivated area. In this case, however, we\r\nshould expect to find the _valet_ greater than the _valuit_, while\r\nreally we find that a fall in value is normal throughout the shire.\r\n\r\n[Digression to East Anglia.]\r\n\r\nWe must here say one parenthetical word about the account of East\r\nAnglia. In one respect it differs from the account of any other\r\ndistrict[1410]. We are told of the various landholders that they hold so\r\nmany carucates or so many acres. Analogy would lead us to suppose that\r\nthis is a statement touching the amount of geld with which they are\r\ncharged. Though there is no statement parallel to the _Terra est b\r\ncarucis_ which we find in most parts of England, still there are some\r\nother counties remote from East Anglia--Gloucester, Worcester,\r\nHereford--where no such statement is given to us. In other words, a\r\nnatural first guess would be that in Norfolk and Suffolk we are informed\r\nabout _A_ and not about _B_. But then, it is apparent that some\r\ninformation about _A_ is being given to us by a quite different formula\r\nsuch as we shall not meet outside East Anglia. We are told about a vill\r\nthat when the hundred pays 20_s._ for the geld this vill pays so many\r\npence--seven pence halfpenny, it may be, or eight pence three farthings.\r\nThis is the formula which prescribes how much geld the landholders of\r\nthe vill must pay and it says nothing of carucates or of acres. Now this\r\nmight make us think that the carucates and acres which are attributed to\r\nthe landholders are 'real' and not 'rateable' areas, and are to be put\r\non a level with the teamlands (_B_) rather than with the hides or\r\ngelding carucates (_A_) of other counties. Nevertheless, on second\r\nthoughts we may return to our first opinion. If these carucates are\r\nequivalent to the teamlands of other counties, Norfolk and Suffolk not\r\nonly differ but differ very widely from the rest of England[1411]. In\r\nNorfolk we make about 2,422 carucates and about 4,853 teams, and,\r\nhowever wide of the mark these figures may be[1412], the fact that there\r\nare upon an average about two teams to every carucate is apparent on\r\npage after page of the record; often the ratio is yet higher. We have\r\nseen a phenomenon of the same kind, though less pronounced, in\r\nNottingham; but then, if in Norfolk we proceed to divide the 'recorded\r\npopulation' by the number of carucates, we shall get 11 as our quotient.\r\nThis is so very much higher than anything that we have seen elsewhere\r\nthat we are daunted by it; for, even though we recall the possibility\r\nthat a good many tenants in this free county are counted twice because\r\nthey hold under two lords, still this reflection will hardly enable us\r\nto make the requisite allowance. To this it may be added that if we\r\ndivide the acreage of Norfolk by its carucates and treat the carucates\r\nas teamlands, the quotient will place Norfolk among the counties in\r\nwhich the smallest part of the total area was under the plough. Further,\r\nit will be observed that the statement about the geldability of the\r\nvills does not enable us to bring home any particular sum to any given\r\nman. Be it granted that the sum due from a vill is fixed by the\r\nproposition that it contributes thirteen pence to every pound levied\r\nfrom the hundred, we have still to decide how much Ralph and how much\r\nRoger, two landholders of the vill, must contribute; and our decision\r\nwill, we take it, be dictated by the statement that Ralph has one\r\ncarucate and Roger 60 acres. We fear therefore that here again we can\r\nnot penetrate through the rateable to the real[1413].\r\n\r\n[The teamland no areal measure.]\r\n\r\nAbout the 'land for one team' we can hardly get beyond vague guesswork,\r\nand may seriously doubt whether the inquiry as to the number of possible\r\nploughs was interpreted in the same manner in all parts of the country.\r\nHere it may have been regarded as a reference to the good old time of\r\nKing Edward, here to the local custom; there an attempt may have been\r\nmade to enforce some royal 'standard measure,' and there again men were\r\ndriven to speculate as to what might happen if a wilderness were once\r\nmore inhabited. But unless we are mistaken, the first step towards a\r\nsolution of the many problems that beset us is taken when we perceive\r\nthat the jurors have not been asked to state the areal extent of the\r\ntilled or the tillable land.\r\n\r\n[Eyton's theory.]\r\n\r\nFar other, as is well known, was the doctrine of one whom all students\r\nof Domesday revere. For Mr Eyton the teamland was precisely 120 of our\r\nstatute acres[1414]. The proof offered of this lies in a comparison of\r\nthe figures given by Domesday with the superficial content of modern\r\nparishes. What seems to us to have been proved is that, if we start with\r\nthe proposed equation, we shall rarely be brought into violent collision\r\nwith ascertained facts, and that, when such a collision seems imminent,\r\nit can almost always be prevented by the intervention of some plausible\r\nhypothesis about shifted boundaries or neglected wastes. More than this\r\nhas not been done. Always at the end of his toil the candid investigator\r\nadmits that when he has added up all the figures that Domesday gives for\r\narable, meadow, wood and pasture, the land of the county is by no means\r\nexhausted. Then the residue must be set down as 'unsurveyed' or\r\n'unregistered' and guesses made as to its whereabouts[1415]. Then\r\nfurther, this method involves theories about lineal and superficial\r\nmeasurements which are, in our eyes, precarious.\r\n\r\n[Domesday's lineal measure.]\r\n\r\nOne word about this point must be said, though we can not devote much\r\nroom to it. The content of various spaces, such as woods and pastures,\r\nis often indicated by a reference to linear standards, leagues,\r\nfurlongs, perches, feet, and there seems to be little doubt that the\r\nmain equations which govern the system are these:\r\n\r\n     1 league = 12 furlongs or quarentines or acre-lengths\r\n              = 480 perches.\r\n\r\nNow we read numerous statements which take the following form:--'It is\r\n_x_ leagues (furlongs, perches) long and _y_ wide,' or, to take a\r\nconcrete example, 'The wood is 1 league long and 4 furlongs wide.' The\r\nquestion arises whether we are justified in making this mean that here\r\nis a wood whose superficial content is equal to that of a rectangular\r\nparallelogram 480 statute perches long by 160 statute perches wide. We\r\nare rash in imposing our perch of 16·5 feet on the whole England of the\r\neleventh century, even though we are to measure arable land. We are\r\nrasher in using that perch for the measurement of woodland. But perhaps\r\nwe are rasher still in supposing that the Domesday jurors have true\r\nsuperficial measurement in their minds[1416]. We strongly suspect that\r\nthey are thinking of shape as well as of size, and may be giving us the\r\nextreme diameters of the wood or some diameters that they guess to be\r\nnear the mean. If a clergyman told us that his parish was 3 miles long\r\nby 2 wide, we should not accuse him of falsehood or blunder if we\r\nsubsequently discovered that in shape it was approximately a\r\nright-angled triangle and contained only some 3 superficial miles. And\r\nnow let us observe how rude these statements are. The Norfolk jurors are\r\nin the habit of recording the length and the breadth of the vills.\r\nOccasionally they profess to do this with extreme accuracy[1417].\r\nHowever, we reckon that in about 100 out of 550 cases they say that the\r\nvill is one league long by a half-league wide. This delightfully\r\nsymmetrical county therefore should have quite a hundred parishes, each\r\nof which contains close upon 720 acres. Among the 800 parishes of\r\nmodern Norfolk there are not 70 whose size lies between 600 and 800\r\nacres. We are not saying that time spent over these lineal measurements\r\nis wasted, but an argument which gets to the size of the teamland by\r\npostulating in the first place that our statute perch was commonly used\r\nfor all purposes throughout England, and in the second that these lineal\r\ncan be converted into superficial measurements by simple arithmetic, is\r\nnot very cogent and is apt to become circular, for the teamland contains\r\nits 120 acres because that is the space left for it by parochial\r\nboundaries when we have measured off the woods and pastures, and our\r\nmeasurement of the woods and pastures is correct because it will leave\r\n120 acres for every teamland.\r\n\r\n[Measured teamlands.]\r\n\r\nOne more word about these lineal measurements. In Norfolk and Suffolk\r\nthe total area of the vills is indicated by them, and so it is in\r\nYorkshire also. Now, unless we err, it sometimes happens that if we\r\narithmetically deduce the total area from its recorded length and\r\nbreadth, and then subtract from that area the content of any measured\r\nwoods and pastures that there may be, we shall be left with too little\r\nspace to give each East Anglian carucate or each Yorkshire teamland 120\r\nacres and with far too little to allow a similar area to each East\r\nAnglian team. Try one experiment. At Shereford in Norfolk we have to\r\nforce at least one carucate on which there are two teams into a space\r\nthat is 3 furlongs in length by 3 in breadth[1418]. That means, if our\r\nmethod be sound, that each team has at the utmost 45 acres to till. Try\r\nwe Yorkshire. There also we shall find entries which to all appearance\r\nwill not suffer us to give 120 acres to the teamland.\r\n\r\n     In Andrebi ... 9 carucates for geld; there may be 6 teams.... The\r\n     whole half a league long and half [a league] wide[1419].\r\n\r\n     In Hotone and Bileham ... a manor of 10 carucates for geld; there\r\n     may be 10 teams.... The whole 10 quarantines long and 8 wide[1420].\r\n\r\n     In Warlavesbi 6 carucates for geld; there may be 4 teams.... The\r\n     whole half a league long and half [a league] wide[1421].\r\n\r\nIt would seem then that in these cases the utmost limit for the teamland\r\nis 60, 80, 90 acres. Then again, there are a few precious instances in\r\nwhich lineal measures are used in order to indicate the size of a piece\r\nof land the whole of which is arable. This occurs so rarely that we may\r\nfairly expect something exceptional. The result is bewildering. At\r\nThetford we hear of land that is half a league long and half a league\r\nwide: 'the whole of this land is arable and 4 teams can plough\r\nit[1422].' Here then, but 90 acres are assigned to the teamland. We\r\njourney to Yorkshire and first we will take an entry which suits the\r\nEytonian doctrine well enough. 'There are 13 carucates of land less one\r\nbovate for geld; 8 teams can plough them.... Arable land 10 quarentines\r\nlong and equally broad[1423].' In this case we have 1000 acres to divide\r\namong 8 teamlands, and this would make each teamland 125 acres:--we\r\ncould hardly expect a pleasanter quotient. But on the same page we have\r\nan entry which tells of a manor with 60 carucates and 6 bovates for geld\r\nand 35 teamlands where the 'arable land' is described as being '2\r\nleagues long and 2 [leagues] wide[1424].' This gives nearly 165 acres to\r\nthe teamland. There are two Lincolnshire entries which, when treated in\r\na similar way, give 160[1425] and 225[1426] acres to the teamland. Then\r\nthere is a Staffordshire entry which gives no less than 360 acres to\r\neach teamland, though it gives only 160 to each existing team[1427]. The\r\nsuspicion can not but cross our minds that as regards the amount of\r\nland that had 8 oxen for its culture there may have been as wide a\r\ndifference between the various shires in the days of the Confessor as\r\nthere was in the days of Arthur Young; only, whereas in the eighteenth\r\ncentury a little space ploughed by many oxen was a relic of barbarism,\r\nit was in the eleventh an index of prosperity, freedom, a thick\r\npopulation and a comparatively intense agriculture. But theories about\r\nthe facts of husbandry will not dispel the whole of the fog which\r\nshrouds the Domesday teamland.\r\n\r\n[Amount of ploughed land in England.]\r\n\r\nThat, if all England be taken as a whole, the average teamland of\r\nDomesday Book would contain about 120 acres seems possible, and since we\r\nourselves are committed to the belief that the old traditional hide had\r\narable acres to this number, it may be advisable that we should examine\r\nsome districts of ancient England through the medium of the hypothesis\r\nthat Domesday's teamland has a long-hundred of our statute acres. In\r\nColumn 1. of the following table we place the result obtained if we\r\nmultiply a county's teamlands (or in the case of Sussex and Gloucester\r\nthe teams) by 120; and in the following columns we give the figures\r\nwhich show the state of the county in 1895. In order to make a rough\r\ncomparison the easier, we give round figures and omit three noughts, so\r\nthat, for example, 371 stands for 371,000 acres[1428].\r\n\r\n     A            A         P           M           W           T  M\r\n     r            r         e           o           o           o  o\r\n     a            a         r           u L         o           t  d\r\n     b            b         m           n a g       d t         a  e\r\n     l            l         a           t n r       s i         l  r\r\n     e            e         n (         a d a         o            n\r\n                            e 1         i   z       a n         A\r\n     i            (         n 8         n u i       n           c  C\r\n     n            1         t 9           s n       d (         r  o\r\n                  8           5         a e g         1         e  u\r\n     1            9         P )         n d         P 8         a  n\r\n     0            5         a           d   (       l 9         g  t\r\n     8            )         s             f 1       a 5         e  y\r\n     6                      t           H o 8       n )\r\n                            u           e r 9       t           o\r\n                            r           a   5       a           f\r\n                            e           t   )\r\n                                        h\r\n\r\n                                                                  Total\r\n                                          Mountain               Acreage\r\n                                          and Heath                of\r\n                              Permanent   Land used   Woods and  Modern\r\n           Arable in  Arable   pastures  for grazing Plantation  County\r\n             1086     (1895)     (1895)    (1895)      (1895)     (1895)\r\n\r\n             1000      1000      1000     1000         1000        1000\r\n             Acres     Acres     Acres    Acres        Acres       Acres\r\n\r\n  Sussex      371       298       381        9          124         933\r\n  Surrey      141       133       152       12           54         461\r\n  Berkshire   251       204       163        1           36         462\r\n  Dorset      280       188       300       18           38         632\r\n  Somerset    577       207       653       48           46        1042\r\n  Devon       957       581       633      138           86        1667\r\n  Buckingham  269       165       236        2           32         476\r\n  Oxford      317       228       188        1           27         485\r\n  Gloucester  589       269       387        7           58         797\r\n  Bedford     187       155       100        1           13         298\r\n  Northampton 352       215       344        0           28         640\r\n  Lincoln     605      1017       501        2           43        1695\r\n\r\n[Decrease of arable.]\r\n\r\nThese figures are startling enough. We are required to believe that in\r\nmany counties, even in Sussex where the forest still filled a large\r\nspace, there were more acres ploughed T. R. W. than are ploughed T. R.\r\nV., while in some cases the number has been reduced by one half during\r\nthe intervening centuries. Were the old acres in Oxfordshire as large as\r\nour own, a good deal more than three-fifths of that county was ploughed.\r\nMuch might be said of the extreme futility of ancient agriculture. Then\r\nwe should have to remember the 'inclosures' of the sixteenth century;\r\nalso the movement which in our own day threatens to carry us back to\r\n'the pastoral state[1429].' We should have to scrutinize those abundant\r\nmarks of the plough which occur in our meadows and on our hillsides,\r\neven where we least expect them, and to distinguish those which were\r\nbeing made in the days of the Norman conqueror from those which tell of\r\na much later age when 'the Corsican tyrant' threatened our shores.\r\n\r\n[The food problem.]\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the great food problem. At this point we might desire\r\nthe aid of a jury of scientific experts. We are, indeed, but ill\r\nprepared to deliver a charge or to define a clear issue, but the main\r\nquestion may be roughly stated thus:--South of Yorkshire and Cheshire we\r\nhave some 275,000 'recorded men,' some 75,000 recorded teams and (if we\r\nallow 120 statute acres to every team) some 9,000,000 statute acres of\r\narable land[1430]. Is this supply of arable adequate or excessive for\r\nthe population? Unfortunately, however, the question involves more than\r\none unknown quantity.\r\n\r\n[What was the population?]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, by what figure are we to multiply the number of\r\n'recorded men' before we shall obtain the total population? Here we have\r\nto remember that nothing is said by our record about some of the largest\r\ntowns and that the figures which we obtain from Norwich[1431] suggest\r\nthat the inhabitants of London, Winchester and the like should not be\r\nneglected, even by those who are aiming at the rudest computation. Then\r\nwhat we read of Bury St Edmunds[1432] suggests that around every great\r\nabbey were clustered many artificers, servants and bedesmen who as a\r\ngeneral rule were not enumerated by the jurors. We must also remember\r\nthe monks, nuns and canons and the large households of barons and\r\nprelates[1433]. Again, it is by no means unlikely that, despite a high\r\nrate of mortality among children, the household of the ordinary villein\r\nwas upon an average larger than is the household of the modern cottager\r\nor artizan, for the blood-bond was stronger than it is now-a-days.\r\nMarried brothers with their wives and children may not unfrequently have\r\ndwelt in one house and may be described in our record as a single\r\n_villanus_ because they hold an undivided inheritance. On the other\r\nhand, we have seen reason to think that in the eastern villages many men\r\nmay be counted more than once[1434]. Shall we, for the sake of argument,\r\nmultiply the recorded men by 5? This would give us a population of\r\n1,375,000 souls[1435].\r\n\r\n[What was the field-system?]\r\n\r\nWhat portion of the arable land shall we suppose to be sown in any one\r\nyear? Some grave doubts may occur to us before we put this portion\r\nhigher than one half[1436]. Common opinion would perhaps strike a\r\nbalance between two-field and three-field husbandry. So we will suppose\r\nthat out of 9 million acres 5 million are sown.\r\n\r\n[What was the acre's yield?]\r\n\r\nThen comes the insoluble question about the acre's yield. Even could we\r\nstate an average, this would not be very serviceable, for every district\r\nhad to feed itself in every year, and the statistics of the later\r\nmiddle ages suggest that the difference between good and bad years was\r\nvery large, while the valuations of the manors in Domesday Book seem to\r\ntell us that the difference between fertile and sterile, forward and\r\nbackward counties was much wider in the eleventh century than it is in\r\nour own day. The scientific agriculturist of the thirteenth century\r\nproposed to sow an acre with two bushels of wheat and regarded ten\r\nbushels as the proper return[1437]. Walter of Henley proved by figures\r\nthat a three-fold return would not be remunerative, unless prices were\r\nexceptionally good, but he evidently thought of this exiguous yield as a\r\npossibility[1438], and yet, as we have seen, he represents the 'high\r\nfarming' of his time and in his two-course husbandry would plough the\r\nland thrice over between every two crops. In the first half of the next\r\ncentury we can not put the average as high as 8 bushels[1439]. To eyes\r\nthat look for 29 or 30, a yield of from 6 to 10 may seem pitiful; and\r\nthe 'miserable husbandry' that Arthur Young saw in the west of England\r\nwas producing from 15 to 20[1440]. However, there are countries in which\r\na crop of wheat which gave 10 of our bushels to one of our acres would\r\nnot be very small[1441]. For our present purpose, the figure that we\r\nshould wish to obtain would be, not that which expressed the yield of an\r\naverage year, but that which was the outcome of a bad year, for we have\r\nto keep folk alive and they can not wait for the good times. Let us then\r\ntake our hypothesis from Walter of Henley. We suppose a yield of 6\r\nbushels, 2 of which must be retained for seed. This would give us 20\r\nmillion bushels as food, or, we will say, 15 bushels for every person.\r\n\r\n[Of beer.]\r\n\r\nNow, had we to deal with modern wheat and modern mills, we might argue\r\nthat the bushel of wheat would weigh 60 pounds, that the weight of\r\nflour would be 72 per cent. of the weight of grain[1442], and that every\r\nhuman mouth could thus be provided with a little more than 28 ounces of\r\nflour every day, or, to put it another way, with bread amounting to\r\nnine-sixteenths of a four pound loaf[1443]. Some large, but indefinable,\r\ndeduction should be made from this amount on the score of poor grain and\r\nwasteful processes. As the sum stands, we are at present proposing to\r\ngive to each person a great deal more wheat-flour than would be obtained\r\nif the total amount consumed now-a-days in the United Kingdom were\r\ndivided by the number of its inhabitants[1444]. But it need hardly be\r\nsaid that the problem is far more complex than are our figures. In the\r\nfirst place, we have to withdraw from the men of 1086 a large quantity,\r\nperhaps more than a half, of the wheat-flour that we have given them in\r\norder to supply its place with other cereals[1445], in particular with\r\nbarley and oats, much of which, together with some of the wheat[1446],\r\nwill be consumed in the form of beer. And who shall fathom that ocean?\r\n_Multum biberunt de cerevisia Anglicana_, as the pope said. Their choice\r\nlay for the more part between beer and water. In the twelfth century the\r\ncorn-rents paid to the bishop of Durham often comprised malt, wheat and\r\noats in equal quantities[1447]. In the next century the economy of the\r\ncanons of St. Paul's was so arranged that for every 30 quarters of\r\nwheat that went to make bread, 7 quarters of wheat, 7 of barley and 32\r\nof oats went to make beer[1448]. The weekly allowance of every canon\r\nincluded 30 gallons[1449]. In one year their brewery seems to have\r\nproduced 67,814 gallons from 175 quarters of wheat, a like quantity of\r\nbarley and 708 quarters of oats[1450]. With such figures before us, it\r\nbecomes a serious question whether we can devote less than a third of\r\nthe sown land to the provision of drink. The monk, who would have\r\ngrowled if he got less than a gallon a day, would, we may suppose,\r\nconsume in the course of a year 20 bushels of barley or an equivalent\r\namount of other grain: in other words, the produce, when seed-corn is\r\ndeducted, of from two to three acres of land; and perhaps to every mouth\r\nin England we must give half a gallon daily[1451].\r\n\r\n[The Englishman's diet.]\r\n\r\nBut if we can not make teetotallers of our ancestors (and in very truth\r\nwe can not) neither may we convert them to vegetarianism. What we can\r\nread of the provender-rents paid in the days before the Conquest\r\nsuggests that those who were well-to-do, including the monks, consumed a\r\ngreat deal of mutton, pork, poultry, fish, eels, cheese and honey[1452].\r\nThis would relieve the arable of part of the pressure that it would\r\notherwise have borne, for, though we already hear of two manors which\r\nbetween them supply 6000 dog-loaves for the king's hounds[1453], and\r\nalso read of pigs that are fattened with corn[1454], it is not very\r\nprobable that any beasts, save those that laboured, got much from the\r\narable, except the straw, and the stubble which we may suspect of having\r\nbeen abundantly mixed with grass and weeds. It is likely, however, that\r\nthe oxen which were engaged in ploughing were fed at times with oats.\r\nWalter of Henley would keep his plough-beasts at the manger for\r\nfive-and-twenty weeks in the year and would during that time give 70\r\nbushels of oats to every eight of them[1455]. At this rate our 75,000\r\nteams would require 5,250,000 bushels of oats, and on this score we\r\nmight have to deduct some 4 million bushels of wheat[1456] from our 20\r\nmillions and reduce by one-fifth each person's allowance of grain. But\r\nthen, it is by no means certain that we ought to transplant Walter's\r\npractices into the eleventh century; we have seen that he expected much\r\nof his oxen[1457].\r\n\r\n[Is the arable super-abundant?]\r\n\r\nAt first sight it may seem incredible that the average human being\r\nannually required the produce of nearly seven acres. But observe how\r\nrapidly the area will disappear. We deduct a half for the idle shift; a\r\nthird of the remainder we set apart as beer-land. We have not much more\r\nthan two acres remaining, and may yet have to feed oxen and horses. But\r\nsuppose that we concede to every human mouth the wheat of two full\r\nacres; we can not say for certain that we are giving it a quarter of\r\ngrain, even though we suppose each acre to yield more than was to be had\r\nalways and everywhere in the fourteenth century[1458].\r\n\r\n[Amount of pasturage.]\r\n\r\nOur doubt about the food of the oxen makes it difficult for us to state\r\neven the outlines of another important problem. Are we leaving pasture\r\nenough for the beasts? Their number was by no means small. South of the\r\nsouthern frontier of Cheshire and Yorkshire we must accommodate in the\r\nfirst place some 600,000 beasts of the plough, and in the second place\r\nand for their maintenance a sufficiency of bulls, cows and calves.\r\nNow-a-days England keeps 4,723,000 head of cattle, but we have been\r\nexcluding from view near a quarter of England. Then there are other\r\nanimals to be provided for. Their number we can not guess, for\r\napparently the statistics that we obtain from the south-western and\r\neastern counties give us only the stock that is on the demesne of the\r\nmanors[1459]. We have seen that the peasants in East Anglia had sheep\r\nenough to make their 'fold-soke' an important social institution[1460].\r\nAlso we have much evidence of large herds of pigs belonging to the\r\nvilleins, though these we may send to the woods. But, attending only to\r\nthe dominical stock, we will begin by looking at the manor which stands\r\nfirst in the Cambridgeshire Inquest. The lord has 5 teams, 8 head of\r\nnot-ploughing cattle, 4 rounceys, 10 pigs and 480 sheep. Then, in the\r\naccompanying table we will give some figures from various counties which\r\nshow the amount of stock that is kept where there are 200 teams or\r\nthereabouts.\r\n\r\n          Teams (Demesne   Beasts not\r\n                and          of the\r\n              Tenants')      Plough   Horses   Goats    Pigs    Sheep\r\n\r\n  Essex         207            267      34      107      777     1657\r\n  Suffolk       200            196      30      295      676     1705\r\n  Norfolk       202            132      44      200      672     5673\r\n  Dorset        202            159      47      281      479     6160\r\n  Somerset      202             82      16       49      198     1506\r\n  Devon         205            282      16      135      173     1553\r\n  Cornwall      200             62      35       52       26     1445\r\n    Total      1418           1180     222     1119     3001    19699\r\n\r\nEven if we look only at the flocks which belong to the holders of\r\nmanors, we may have to feed a million sheep south of the Humber, and,\r\nthough all England now maintains more than 15 millions, it does this by\r\ndevoting a large portion of its arable to the growth of turnips and the\r\nlike. No doubt, the medieval sheep were wretched little animals; also\r\nlarge numbers of them were slaughtered and salted at the approach of\r\nwinter; but from the arable they got only the stubble, and every\r\nextension of the ploughed area deteriorated the quality besides\r\ndiminishing the quantity of the pasture that was left for their hungry\r\nmouths. As already said, our forefathers did not live on bread and beer;\r\nbacon must have been plentiful among them[1461]. Also many fleeces were\r\nneeded for their clothing. As to meadow land (_pratum_), that is, land\r\nthat was mown, it was sparse and precious[1462]; the supply of it was\r\noften insufficient even for the lord's demesne oxen. At least in\r\nCambridgeshire, we find traces of a theory which taught that every ox\r\nshould have an acre of meadow; but commonly this was an unrealized\r\nideal[1463]. In Dorset now-a-days there will be near 95,000 acres\r\ngrowing grass for hay, whereas there were not 7,000 acres of meadow in\r\n1086[1464]. Therefore we are throwing a heavy strain on the\r\npasture[1465].\r\n\r\n[Area of the villages.]\r\n\r\nLastly, we must not neglect, as some modern calculators do, the sites of\r\nthe villages, the straggling group of houses with their court-yards,\r\ngardens and crofts, for this deducts a sensible piece from the\r\nconceivably tillable area. An exceedingly minute account of Sawston in\r\nCambridgeshire which comes from the year 1279 shows us a territory thus\r\ndivided: Messuages, Gardens, Crofts, etc., 85 acres: Arable, 1243\r\nacres: Meadow, 82 acres: Several Pasture, 30 acres. The neighbouring\r\nvillage of Whittlesford shows us: Messuages, Gardens, Crofts, etc., 35\r\nacres: Arable, 1363 acres: Meadow, 44 acres: Several Pasture, 35 acres.\r\nIn both cases we must add some unspecified quantity of Common\r\nPasture[1466]. The core of the village was not large when compared with\r\nits fields; but it can not be ignored.\r\n\r\n[Produce and value.]\r\n\r\nRecurring for a moment to our food problem, we may observe that the\r\nvalues that are set on the manors in Domesday Book seem to point to a\r\nvery feeble yield of corn. Without looking for extreme cases, we shall\r\noften find that the value of a teamland is no more than 10 shillings.\r\nNow let us make the hypothesis most favourable to fertility and suppose\r\nthat this 'value' represents a pure, net rent[1467]. We will make\r\nanother convenient but extravagant assumption; we will say that 24\r\nbushels of wheat will make 365 four-pound loaves. If then a lord is to\r\nget one such loaf every day from each teamland that is valued at 10\r\nshillings, the price of wheat will be a good deal less than 5 pence the\r\nbushel; if two daily loaves are to be had, the price of the bushel must\r\nbe reduced below 2-1/2 pence, for the cost of grinding and baking is not\r\nnegligible. Whether this last price could be assumed as normal must be\r\nvery doubtful, for the little that Domesday tells us about the price of\r\ngrain is told in obscure and disputable terms[1468]. However, the\r\nevidence that comes to us from the twelfth[1469] and thirteenth\r\ncenturies[1470] suggests a rough equivalence between an ox and two\r\nquarters of wheat, and in the eleventh the traditional price of the ox\r\nwas 30 pence. But at any rate, the lord who has a small village with\r\nfive teamlands, and who lets it to a _firmarius_, will receive a rent\r\nwhich, when it is stated in loaves, is by no means splendid. He will not\r\nbe much of a _hláford_, or have many 'loaf-eaters' if his whole revenue\r\nis £2. 10_s._ or, in other words, if he is lord of but one small village\r\nin the midlands.\r\n\r\n[Varying size of acres.]\r\n\r\nHere we must leave this question to those who are expert in the history\r\nof agriculture; but if some relief is required, it may be plausibly\r\nobtained by a reduction in the size of the ancient acre. A small piece\r\noff the village perches will mean a great piece off the 2,600 teamlands\r\nof Oxfordshire, and we seem to have the best warrant for a recourse to\r\nthis device where it is most needed. The pressure upon our space appears\r\nto be at its utmost in Oxfordshire, and just for that county we have\r\nfirst-rate evidence of some very small acres[1471]. On the other hand,\r\nin Lincolnshire and generally in the north, where we read of abnormally\r\nlarge acres, we seem to have room enough for them. And here may be a\r\npartial explanation of the apparent fact that the teamland of\r\nOxfordshire does not support three, while that of Lincolnshire supports\r\nfive recorded men.\r\n\r\n[The teamland in Cambridgeshire.]\r\n\r\nIn these last paragraphs we have been speaking of averages struck for\r\nlarge spaces; but if we come to some particular districts we shall have\r\nthe greatest difficulty in allowing 120 acres to every teamland. This is\r\nthe case in southern Cambridgeshire. In that county Domesday's list of\r\nvills is so nearly the same as the modern list of parishes that we run\r\nno great risk in comparing the ancient teamlands with the modern acreage\r\nvill by vill, if we also compare them hundred by hundred. The general\r\nresult will be to make us unwilling to bestow on every teamland a\r\nlong-hundred of acres. One example shall be given. The Whittlesford\r\nHundred[1472] contains five vills and we can not easily concede to it\r\nmore land than is now within its boundary. In the following table we\r\ngive for each vill its modern acreage, then the number of its teamlands,\r\nthen the result of multiplying that number by 120.\r\n\r\n                 WHITTLESFORD HUNDRED.\r\n\r\n       Sawston        1884      10          1200\r\n       Whittlesford   1969      11          1320\r\n       Duxford        3232      21[1473]    2520\r\n       Hinxton        1557      16[1474]    1920\r\n       Ickleton       2695      24-1/2      2940\r\n     The Hundred     11337      82-1/2      9900\r\n\r\nIn two cases out of five we have already come upon sheer physical\r\nimpossibility. But let us suppose some rearrangement of parish\r\nboundaries and look at the whole hundred. We are giving it 9900 acres of\r\narable and leaving 1437 for other purposes. Then we are told of 'meadow\r\nfor' 37 teams and this at the rate usual in Cambridgeshire[1475], means\r\n296 acres, so that we have only 1141 left. On this we must place the\r\nsites of five villages, houses, farmyards, fourteen water-mills,\r\ncottages, gardens. Probably we want 250 acres at least to meet this\r\ndemand. Not 900 acres remain for pasture. The dominical flocks and herds\r\nwere not large, but the lords were receiving divers ploughshares in\r\nreturn for the pasture rights accorded to the tenants and in some of the\r\nvills there was not nearly enough meadow for the oxen of the villeins.\r\nIt is difficult to believe that 87 per cent. of a Cambridgeshire hundred\r\nwas under the plough, and that less than 8 per cent. was pasture.\r\nHowever, we know too little to say that even this was impossible. In the\r\ntwelfth century we read of manors in which there is no pasture, except\r\nupon the arable field that is taking its turn of idleness[1476]. We must\r\nremember that this idle field was not fallowed until the summer[1477];\r\nalso we may suspect that much that was not corn grew on the medieval\r\ncorn-land.\r\n\r\n[The hides of Domesday.]\r\n\r\nSaddened by our encounter with the teamlands (_B_)--and our last word\r\nabout them is not yet said--we turn to the hides, carucates and sulungs\r\n(_A_). With a fair allowance for errors we feel safe in believing that\r\nthe total number mentioned by Domesday Book falls short of 70,000--and\r\nyet time was when we spoke of 60,000 knight's fees of 5 hides\r\napiece[1478]. Let us then recall once more those tales of taxation that\r\nare told by the chronicler[1479]. If Cnut raised a geld of £72,000,\r\nthen, even if we allow him something from those remote northern lands\r\nwhich William's commissioners did not enter, the rate of the impost can\r\nhardly have been less than a pound on the hide. We are not told that he\r\nraised this sum in the course of a single year; but, even if we suppose\r\nit spread over four years, it is a monstrous exaction, and we can\r\nhardly fancy that in earlier days the pirates had waited long for the\r\n£24,000 or £30,000 that were the price of their forbearance. And yet, as\r\nalready said, our choice seems to lie between believing these stories\r\nand charging the annalist with reckless mendacity. Hereafter we shall\r\nargue that some ancient statements about hidage, even some made by Bede\r\nhimself, deserve no credit; but it is one thing for a Northumbrian\r\nscholar of the eighth century to make very bad guesses about the area of\r\nSussex, and another for a chronicler of the eleventh to keep on telling\r\nus that a king levies £21,099 or £11,048 or the like, if these sums are\r\nwildly in excess of those that were demanded. As to the value of money,\r\nthe economists must be heard; but it is probable that the sea-rovers\r\ninsisted on good weight[1480], and when in the twelfth century we can\r\nbegin to trace the movement of prices, in particular the price of oxen,\r\nthey are not falling but rising. However, we have already said our say\r\nabout the enormity of the danegeld.\r\n\r\n[Relation between hide and teamland.]\r\n\r\nWe are now to investigate the 'law' of _A_ and its relation to _B_. We\r\nshall soon be convinced that we are not dealing with two perfectly\r\nindependent variables. There will often be wide variations between the\r\ntwo; _A_ may descend to zero, while _B_ is high, and in some counties we\r\nshall see a steady tendency which makes _A_ decidedly higher or\r\ndecidedly lower than _B_. And yet, if we look at England as a whole, we\r\ncan not help feeling that in some sense or another _A_ ought to be equal\r\nto _B_, and that, when this equation holds good, things are in a\r\ncondition that we may call normal. Perhaps, as we shall see hereafter,\r\nthe current notion has been that the teamland should be taxed as a hide\r\nif it lies in a district where a teamland will usually be worth about a\r\npound a year. But for the time we will leave value out of account, and,\r\nto save words, we will appropriate three terms and use them technically.\r\nWhen _A_ = _B_, there is 'equal rating'; when _A_ > _B_, there is\r\n'over-rating'; when _A_ < _B_ there is 'under-rating.' We shall find,\r\nthen, that in many counties there are numerous cases of equal rating.\r\nThus in Buckinghamshire we count\r\n\r\n     cases of under-rating  136\r\n     cases of equal rating  102\r\n     cases of over-rating   115\r\n\r\nIn Lincolnshire we may find an unbroken series of fourteen entries each\r\nof which gives us an instance of equal rating[1481]. In both\r\nLincolnshire and Yorkshire such cases are common, but, while in\r\nLincolnshire over-rating is rare, in Yorkshire under-rating is very\r\nrare. Fewer are the over-rated than the under-rated counties; but there\r\nare some for which the figures can not be given, and, as immense\r\nYorkshire is set before us as much over-rated, the balance must be\r\nnearly redressed. But further, we may see that the relation between _A_\r\nand _B_ is apt to change somewhat suddenly at the border of a county.\r\nThe best illustration is given by the twin shires of Leicester and\r\nNorthampton, the one over-rated, the other grossly under-rated. Another\r\ngood illustration is given by the south-western counties. Wiltshire is\r\nheavily over-rated; Dorset, as a whole, very equally rated; Somerset\r\ndecidedly under-rated, while when we come to Devon and Cornwall we enter\r\na land so much underrated that, had we only the account of these two\r\ncounties, the assumption that is implied in our terms 'under-rated' and\r\n'over-rated' would never have entered our heads.\r\n\r\n[Unhidated estates.]\r\n\r\nNow for one cause of the aberration of _A_ from _B_ we have not far to\r\nseek; it is a cause which will make _A_ less than _B_ and which may\r\nreduce _A_ to zero. It is privilege. Certain estates have been\r\naltogether exempt from geld. In particular many royal estates have been\r\nexempt. '_Nescitur quot hidae sint ibi quia non reddidit\r\ngeldum_'--'_Nunquam geldavit nec scitur quot hidae sint ibi_'--'_Rex\r\nEdwardus tenuit; tunc 20 hidae sed nunquam geldaverunt_':--such and such\r\nlike are the formulas that describe this immunity. The number of\r\nactually geldant hides is here reduced to zero, and sometimes the very\r\nterm 'hides,' so usually does it imply taxation, is deemed\r\ninappropriate. But these royal estates do not stand alone. Often enough\r\nsome estate of a church has been utterly freed from taxation. The bishop\r\nof Salisbury, for example, has a great estate at Sherborne which has\r\ngelded for 43 hides; but 'in this same Sherborne he has 16 carucates of\r\nland; this land was never divided into hides nor did it pay geld[1482].'\r\n\r\n[Beneficial hidation.]\r\n\r\nBut then again, we have the phenomenon which has aptly been called\r\n'beneficial hidation.' Without being entirely freed from the tax, a\r\nmanor has been rated at a smaller number of hides than it really\r\ncontains. 'There are 5 hides' says a Gloucestershire entry, '3 of them\r\ngeld, but by grant of the Kings Edward and William 2 of them do not\r\ngeld[1483].' 'There are 8 hides there' says another entry 'and the ninth\r\nhide belongs to the church of St. Edward; King Æthelred gave it quit\r\n[of geld][1484].' 'There are 20 hides; of these 4 were quit of geld in\r\nthe time of King Cnut[1485].' 'The Bishop [of Winchester] holds Fernham\r\n[Fareham] in demesne; it always belonged to the bishopric; in King\r\nEdward's day it defended itself for 20 hides, and it does so still;\r\nthere are by tale 30 hides, but King Edward gave them thus [i.e. granted\r\nthat they should be 20 hides] by reason of the vikings, for it [Fareham]\r\nis by the sea[1486].' 'Harold held it of King Edward; before Harold had\r\nit, it defended itself for 27 hides, afterwards for 16 hides because\r\nHarold so pleased. The men of the hundred never heard or saw any writ\r\nfrom the king which put it at that figure[1487].' We have chosen these\r\nexamples because they give us more information than we can often obtain;\r\nthey take us back to the days of Cnut and of Æthelred; they tell us of\r\nthe depredations of the vikings; they show us a magnate fixing the\r\nrateable value of his estate _ad libitum suum_. But our record is\r\nreplete with other instances in which we are told that by special royal\r\nfavour an estate has been lightly taxed[1488]. What is more, there are\r\nmany other instances in which we can hardly doubt that this same cause\r\nhas been at work, though we are not expressly told of it. When in a\r\ndistrict which as a whole is over-rated, or but moderately under-rated,\r\nwe come upon a few manors which are extravagantly under-rated, then we\r\nmay fairly draw the inference that there has been 'beneficial hidation.'\r\n\r\n[Effect of privilege.]\r\n\r\nCertainly this will account for much, and we have reason to believe that\r\nthis disturbing force had been in operation for a long time past and on\r\na grand scale. There is an undated writ of Æthelred[1489], which ordains\r\nthat an immense estate of the church of Winchester having Chilcombe for\r\nits centre and containing 100 hides shall defend itself for one hide.\r\nIn Domesday Book Chilcombe does defend itself for one hide though it\r\nhas land for 88 teams[1490]. But further, Æthelred is decreeing nothing\r\nnew; his ancestors, his 'elders,' have 'set and freed' all this land as\r\none hide 'be the same more or less.' Behind this writ stand older\r\ncharters which are not of good repute. Still we can see nothing\r\nimprobable in the supposition that Æthelred issued the writ ascribed to\r\nhim and that what he said in it was substantially true. Before his day\r\nthere may have been no impost that was known as a 'geld'; but there may\r\nhave been, as we have endeavoured to show, other imposts to which land\r\ncontributed at the rate of so much per hide. We suspect that 'beneficial\r\nhidation' had a long history before Domesday Book was made.\r\n\r\n[Divergence of hide from teamland.]\r\n\r\nBut it will not account for all the facts that are before us; indeed it\r\nwill serve for few of them. Privilege can account for exceptional cases;\r\nit will not account for steady and consistent under-rating; still less\r\nwill it account for steady and consistent over-rating. We must look\r\nelsewhere, and for a moment we may find some relief in the reflection\r\nthat by the operation of natural and obvious causes an old rate-book\r\nwill become antiquated. There will be more 'teamlands' than there are\r\ngelding hides because new land has been brought under cultivation; on\r\nthe other hand, land will sometimes go out of cultivation and then there\r\nwill be more gelding hides than there are teamlands. Now that there is\r\ntruth here we do not doubt. As we have already said[1491], the stability\r\nof agrarian affairs in these early times may easily be overestimated.\r\nBut we can not in this direction find the explanation of changes that\r\ntake place suddenly at the boundaries of counties.\r\n\r\n[Partition of the geld.]\r\n\r\nA master hand has lately turned our thoughts to the right quarter. There\r\ncan we think be no doubt that, as Mr Round has argued, the geld was\r\nimposed according to a method which we have called the method of\r\nsubpartitioned provincial quotas[1492]. A sum cast upon a hundred has\r\nbeen divided among that hundred's vills; a sum cast upon a vill has been\r\ndivided among the lands that the vill contains. It is in substance the\r\nmethod which still governs our land-tax, and in this very year our\r\nattention has been pointedly called to its inequitable results. But,\r\nwhereas in later centuries men distributed pounds, shillings and pence\r\namong the counties, our remoter ancestors distributed hides or carucates\r\nor acres. The effect was the same; and it is not unlikely that they\r\ncould pass with rapidity from acres to pence, because the pound had 240\r\npence in it and the fiscal hide had 120 acres. So the complaint urged\r\nthis year that Lancashire is under-taxed and Hertfordshire\r\nover-taxed[1493] would have been in their mouths the complaint that too\r\nmany hides had been cast on the one county and too few on the other.\r\n\r\n[Distribution of hides.]\r\n\r\nWe will not repeat Mr Round's convincing arguments. Just to recall their\r\ncharacter, we will notice the beautiful hundred of Armingford in\r\nCambridgeshire[1494]. In Edward's day it had 100 hides divided among\r\nfourteen vills, six of which had 10 hides apiece, while eight had 5\r\nhides apiece. Before 1085 the number of hides in the hundred had been\r\nreduced from 100 to 80; the number of hides in each of the 'ten-hide\r\nvills' had been reduced to 8; and each 'five-hide vill' had got rid of\r\none of its hides. Obviously such results as these are not obtained by a\r\nmethod which begins by investigating the content of each landholder's\r\ntenement. The hides in the vill are imposed from above, not built up\r\nfrom below[1495].\r\n\r\n[The Worcestershire hidage.]\r\n\r\nWe have no wish to traverse ground which must by this time be familiar\r\nto all students of Domesday. But, having in our eye certain ancient\r\nstatements about the hidage of England, we will endeavour to carry the\r\nargument one step further.\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire we have strong evidence of a neat arrangement of a\r\nwhole county. In the first place, we are told that 'in this county there\r\nare twelve hundreds, whereof seven, so the shire says, are so free that\r\nthe sheriff has nothing in them, and therefore, so he says, he is a\r\ngreat loser by his farm[1496].' Then we are told that the church of\r\nWorcester has a hundred called Oswaldslaw in which lie 300 hides. Then\r\nwe remember that notorious charter (_Altitonantis_) which tells how this\r\ntriple hundred of Oswaldslaw was made up of three old hundreds, called\r\nCuthbertslaw, Wulfhereslaw and Wimborntree[1497]. Then, turning to the\r\nparticulars, we find that exactly 300 hides are ascribed to the various\r\nestates which St. Mary of Worcester holds in this triple hundred. Those\r\nparticulars are the following:--\r\n\r\n[The Worcester estate.]\r\n\r\n  Chemesege   24 }                 Norwiche            25 }\r\n  Wiche       15 }                 Overberie     6 }      }\r\n  Fledebirie  40 }                 Segesbarue    4 }      }\r\n  Breodun     35 }    200          Scepwestun    2 }   25 }     100\r\n  Rippel      25 }                 Herferthun    3 }      }\r\n  Blochelei   38 }                 Grimanleh     3 }      }\r\n  Tredinctun  23 }                 Halhegan      7 }      }\r\n                                   Cropetorn           50 }\r\n\r\nWe have here preserved the order in which Domesday Book names the\r\nestates, but have added some brackets which may serve to emphasize the\r\nartificiality of the system. Then, looking back once more at our\r\n_Altitonantis_, we see Edgar adding lands to the 50 hides at Cropthorn,\r\nso that 'a perfect hundred' may be compiled, and the lands that he adds\r\nseem to be just those which in our table are bracketed with the\r\nCropthorn estate.\r\n\r\n[The Westminster estate.]\r\n\r\nThus we have disposed of three out of those twelve 'hundreds' of which\r\nWorcestershire is composed and also of 300 hides of land. Next we\r\nperceive that the church of Westminster is said to hold 200 hides.\r\nReckoning up the particulars, we find, not indeed 200, but 199.\r\n\r\n                     H. V.

The county also tells us that the church of Pershore ought to\r\nhave the church-scot from 'the whole 300 hides,' that is, as well from\r\nthe 200 allotted to Westminster as from the 100 which Pershore\r\nholds[1498].\r\n\r\n[The Evesham estate.]\r\n\r\nThen Evesham Abbey has, we are told, 65 hides in the hundred of\r\nFissesberge. 'In that hundred,' it is added, 'lie 20 hides of Dodingtree\r\nand 15 hides in Worcester make up the hundred.' The 65 hides which\r\nEvesham holds are allotted thus:--\r\n\r\n               Evesham     3.0 }\r\n               Lenchewic   1.0 }\r\n               Nortune     7.0 }\r\n               Offenham    1.0 }    25\r\n               Liteltune   6.0 }\r\n               Bratfortune 6.0 }\r\n               Aldintone   1.0 }\r\n\r\n               Wiqwene     3.0 }\r\n               Bratfortune 6.0 }\r\n               Badesei     6.2 }    25\r\n               Liteltune   7.0 }\r\n               Huniburne   2.2 }\r\n\r\n               Ambreslege 15.0\r\n                          ----\r\n                          65.0\r\n\r\n[The residue of Worcestershire.]\r\n\r\nWe have dealt heretofore with 665 hides. Let us now reckon up all the\r\nhides in Worcestershire that we have not yet counted. The task is not\r\nperfectly straightforward, for we have to meet a few difficult\r\nquestions. In order that our account may be checked by others, we will\r\nset forth its details. We will go through the survey noting all the\r\nhides which we have not already reckoned.\r\n\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Worcester city   15.0 |  More         1.0 |  Glese          1.0\r\n    Bremesgrave      30.0 |  Betune       3.2 |  Merlie         0.1\r\n    [1499]Suchelei    5.0 |  More         0.1 |  Wich           1.0\r\n    Grastone          3.2 |  Edboldelege  2.2 |  Escelie        4.0\r\n    Cochesei          2.2 |  Eslei        6.0 |  Nordfeld       6.0\r\n    Willingewic       2.3 |  Eslei        1.0 |  Franchelie     1.0\r\n    Celdvic           3.0 |  Ridmerlege   1.2 |  Welingewiche   0.3\r\n    Chideminstre     20.0 |  Celdeslai    1.0 |  Escelie        1.0\r\n    Terdeberie        9.0 |  Estham       3.0 |  Werwelie       0.2\r\n    Clent             9.0 |  Ælmeleia    11.0 |  Cercehalle     2.0\r\n    Wich              0.2 |  Wich        10.0 |  Bellem         3.0\r\n    Clive            10.2 |  Sudtune      1.0 |  Hageleia       5.2\r\n    Fepsetanatum      6.0 |  Mamele       0.2 |  Dudelei        1.0\r\n    Crohlea           5.0 |  Broc         0.2 |  Suineforde     3.0\r\n    Hambyrie         14.0 |  Colingvic    1.0 |  Pevemore       3.0\r\n    Stoche           10.0 |  Mortune      4.0 |  Cradeleie      1.0\r\n    Huerteberie      20.0 |  Stotune      3.0 |  Belintones     5.0\r\n    Ulwardelei        5.0 |  Stanford     2.2 |  Witone         2.0\r\n    Alvievecherche   13.0 |  Scelves      1.0 |  Celvestune     1.0\r\n    Ardolvestone     15.0 |  Chintune     5.0 |  Cochehi        2.2\r\n    Boclintun         8.0 |  Beretune     2.0 |  Osmerlie       1.0\r\n    Cuer              2.0 |  Tamedeberie  3.0 |  Costone        3.0\r\n    Inteberga        15.2 |  Wich         0.2 |  Beneslei       1.0\r\n    Wich              1.0 |  Clistune     3.0 |  Udecote        1.2\r\n    Salewarpe         1.0 |  Chure        3.0 |  Russococ       5.0\r\n    Tametdeberie      0.2 |  Stanford     1.2 |  Stanes         6.0\r\n    Wich              0.2 |  Caldeslei    1.0 |  Lundredele     2.0\r\n    Matma             5.0 |  Cuer         1.0 |  Hatete         1.0\r\n    [1500]Mortune     5.0 |  Hamme        1.0 |  Hamtune        4.0\r\n    Achelenz          4.2 |  Sapie        3.0 |  Hortune        2.0\r\n    Buintun           1.0 |  Carletune    1.1 |  Cochesie       2.0\r\n    Circelenz         4.0 |  Edevent      1.0 |  Brotune        2.0\r\n    Actune            6.0 |  Wicelbold   11.0 |  Urso's hide    1.0\r\n    Lenche            4.0 |  Elmerige     8.0 |  Uptune         3.0\r\n    Wich              1.0 |  Croelai      5.0 |  Witune         0.2\r\n    Ludeleia          2.0 |  Dodeham      1.0 |  Hantune        4.0\r\n    Hala             10.0 |  Redmerleie   1.2 |  Tichenapletreu 3.0\r\n    Salewarpe         5.0 |  Hanlege      1.2 |  Cedeslai      25.0\r\n    Wermeslai         2.0 |  Hanlege      3.0 |  Hilhamatone    0.1\r\n    Linde             2.0 |  Alretune     1.2 |  Fecheham      10.0\r\n    Halac             1.0 |  Hadesoro     2.0 |  Holewei        3.0\r\n    Dunclent          3.0 |  Holim        1.0 | [1501]Mertelai 13.0\r\n    Alvintune         2.0 |  Stilledune   0.2 |               -----\r\n                                                              539.0\r\n\r\nWe have here therefore 539 hides to be added to the 665 of which we\r\nrendered an account above. We thus bring out a grand total of 1204\r\nhides. Perhaps the true total should be exactly 1200; but at any rate it\r\nstands close to that beautiful figure. And now we remember how we were\r\ntold that there were 'twelve hundreds' in Worcestershire from seven of\r\nwhich the sheriff got nothing. Of these twelve the church of Worcester\r\nhad three in its 'hundred' of Oswaldslaw, the church of Westminster two,\r\nthe church of Pershore one, and the church of Evesham one. But the\r\nEvesham or Fissesberge hundred was not perfect; it required 'making up'\r\nby means of 15 hides in the city of Worcester and 20 in the hundred of\r\nDodingtree. Thus five hundreds remain to be accounted for, and in its\r\nrubrics Domesday Book names just five, namely, Came, Clent, Cresselaw,\r\nDodingtree and Esch. We can not allot to each of these its constituent\r\nhides, for we never can rely on Domesday Book giving all the 'hundredal\r\nrubrics' that it ought to give, and the Worcestershire hundreds were\r\nsubjected to rearrangement before the day of maps had dawned[1502]. An\r\nintimate knowledge of the county might achieve the reconstruction of the\r\nold hundreds. But, as it is, we seem to see enough. We seem to see\r\npretty plainly that Worcestershire has been divided into twelve\r\ndistricts known as hundreds each of which has contained 100 hides. It is\r\nan anomaly to be specially noted that one of the jurisdictional\r\nhundreds, one which has been granted to the church of Evesham, has only\r\n65 hides and can only be made up into a 'hundred' for financial purposes\r\nby adding to it 20 hides lying in another jurisdictional hundred and the\r\n15 hides at which the city of Worcester is rated.\r\n\r\n[_The County Hidage._]\r\n\r\nThe moment has now come when we may tender in evidence an ancient\r\ndocument which professes to state the hidage of certain districts. There\r\nare three such documents which should not be confused. We propose to\r\ncall them respectively (1) _The Tribal Hidage_, (2) _The Burghal\r\nHidage_, and (3) _The County Hidage_; and this is their order of date.\r\nFor the two oldest we are not yet ready. The youngest professes to give\r\nus a statement about the hidage of thirteen counties. We have it both\r\nin Latin and in Old English. It has come down to us in divers\r\nmanuscripts, which do not agree very perfectly. We will here give its\r\nupshot, placing in a last column the figures at which we have arrived\r\nwhen counting the hides in Domesday.\r\n\r\n                         THE COUNTY HIDAGE.\r\n\r\n                  Cotton,    Cotton,     Gale,\r\n                  Claudius,  Vespasian, Scriptore   MS.

If\r\nwe put faith in it, we shall be inclined to set its date at some\r\ndistance before that of Domesday Book. But our first question should be\r\nwhether it merits credence; whether it was written by some one who knew\r\nwhat he was about or whether it is wild guesswork. Now when we see that\r\nthe scrupulous Eyton brought out the hides of Staffordshire at 499, or\r\nrather at 499 H 2-13/30 V, and that this document makes them 500, we\r\nshall begin to take it very seriously, without relying on our own 505,\r\nthe result of hasty addition. We have also seen enough to say that 1200\r\nfor Worcestershire is very near the mark. As regards other counties, we\r\nset so little reliance upon our own computation, that we are not very\r\nwilling to institute a comparison; but we have given Bedfordshire 1193\r\nhides[1505] and this document gives it 1200; we have given Oxfordshire\r\n2412 and this document gives it 2400; we have given Gloucestershire\r\n2388[1506] and two versions of this document give it 2400. Having seen\r\nso much agreement, we must note some cases of violent discord. For\r\nWiltshire 4800 seems decidedly too high, though we have brought the\r\nnumber of its hides above 4000. The figure given to Cambridgeshire is\r\nalmost twice that which Domesday would justify, and the figures given to\r\nCheshire, Shropshire and Northamptonshire are absurdly large when\r\ncompared with the numbers recorded in 1086. These cases are enough to\r\nshow that, though no doubt some or all of the transcribers of The County\r\nHidage must be charged with blunders, the divergence of the copies from\r\nDomesday can not be safely laid to this account. About certain counties\r\nthere is just that agreement which we might expect, when we remember how\r\nprecarious our own figures are. About certain other counties there is\r\nutter disagreement. We infer therefore that the original document did\r\nnot truly state the hidage as it stood in 1086; but may it not have\r\nrepresented an older state of things?\r\n\r\n[The Northampton Geld Roll.]\r\n\r\nLet us take one case of flagrant aberration. Three copies tell us that\r\nNorthamptonshire has 3200 hides; one that it has 4200. The balance of\r\nauthority inclines therefore to 3200. Domesday will not give us half\r\nthat number. But let us turn to the Northamptonshire Geld Roll[1507],\r\nthe date of which Mr Round places between the Conquest and 1075[1508].\r\nIt gives the county 2663-1/2 hides. So here we have a case in which\r\nbetween 1075 and 1086 a county was relieved of about half of its\r\nhides[1509]. Also at 2664 we are within a moderate distance of 3200.\r\nBut the Geld Roll does more than this. It represents Northamptonshire as\r\ncomposed of 28 districts; 22 of these are called 'hundreds'; two are\r\n'two-hundreds'; four are 'other-half hundreds,' or, as we might say,\r\n'hundred-and-a-halfs.' We work a sum:--\r\n\r\n                    (22+4+6) × 100 = 3200.\r\n\r\nThe result will increase our respect for The County Hidage. Now, when\r\nthe Geld Roll was made, some of the 'hundreds' of Northamptonshire\r\ncontained their 100 hides apiece, but others were charged with a smaller\r\nnumber, which generally was round, such as 80, 60, 40 hides; and this\r\narrangement is set before us as that which existed 'in the days of\r\nEdward the king.' If therefore we put faith in The County Hidage and its\r\n3200 hides, we must hold that it speaks to us from the earlier part of\r\nthe Confessor's reign or from some yet older time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Value of _The County Hidage_.]\r\n\r\nIs it too good, too neat to be true? Before we pass a condemnatory\r\njudgment we must recall the case of Worcestershire, its twelve\r\n'hundreds' and 1200 hides. Also we must recall the case of the\r\nArmingford hundred in Cambridgeshire, where we have seen how in\r\nWilliam's reign an abatement of 20 per cent, was equitably apportioned\r\namong the fourteen villages, and the 100 hides were reduced to 80[1510].\r\nMoreover, if in Domesday Book we pass from Northamptonshire to the\r\nneighbouring county of Leicester, we see a startling contrast. The\r\nformer is decidedly 'under-rated'; the latter is 'over-rated.'\r\nLeicestershire has about 2500 carucates, while Northamptonshire has\r\nhardly more than half that number of hides. The explanation is that\r\nNorthamptonshire has obtained, while Leicestershire is going to obtain a\r\nreduction. The Pipe Rolls of the twelfth century show us that either\r\nunder Rufus or under Henry I. this sadly over-taxed county was set down\r\nfor exactly 1000 carucates.\r\n\r\n[Reductions of hidage.]\r\n\r\nAs to the other cases in which there is a strident discord between\r\nDomesday and The County Hidage, the case of Chester, where the contrast\r\nis between some 500 hides and a round 1200 will not perhaps detain us\r\nlong, for we may imagine, if we please, that the Chestershire of Cnut's\r\nday was much larger than the territory described under that name in\r\n1086[1511]. The 2500 hides attributed to Cambridgeshire and the 2400\r\nattributed to Shropshire may shock us, for, if they are correctly\r\nstated, they point to reductions of 50 per cent. or thereabouts. But we\r\nhave seen some and are going to see some other large abatements.\r\n\r\n[The county quotas.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we believe that this County Hidage, though it has come to\r\nus in transcripts some or all of which are careless, is an old and\r\ntrustworthy document, that it is right in attributing to the counties\r\nneat sums of hides, such as 1200 and 2400, and that it is right in\r\nrepresenting the current of change that was flowing in the eleventh\r\ncentury as setting towards a rapid reduction in the number of hides.\r\nOnly in one case, that of Warwickshire, have we any cause to believe\r\nthat it gives fewer hides to a county than are given by Domesday; here\r\nthe defect is not very large, and, besides the possibility of\r\nmistranscription, we must also remember the possibility of changed\r\nboundaries[1512].\r\n\r\n[The hundred and the hundred hides.]\r\n\r\nThere is one other feature of this document that we ought to notice. Let\r\nus compare the number of hides which it gives to a county with the\r\nnumber of 'hundreds' which that county contains according to Domesday\r\nBook. The latter number we will place in brackets[1513].\r\n\r\n     Bedfordshire 1200 hides [12 hundreds]: Northamptonshire 3200 [28\r\n     hundreds which, however, have been reckoned to be 32[1514]]:\r\n     Worcestershire 1200 [12]: Warwickshire 1200 [12]: Cheshire 1200\r\n     [12]: Staffordshire 500 [5]: Wiltshire 4800 [40]: Cambridgeshire\r\n     2500 [17]: Huntingdonshire 850 [4]: Gloucestershire 2400\r\n     [39[1515]]: Herefordshire 1500 [19]: Oxfordshire 2400 [uncertain,\r\n     but at least 19]: Shropshire 2400 [13].\r\n\r\nIn six out of thirteen cases we seem to see a connexion of the simplest\r\nkind between the hides and the hundreds. Now in the eyes of some this\r\ntrait may be discreditable to The County Hidage, for they will infer\r\nthat its author was possessed by a theory and deduced the hides from the\r\nhundreds. But, after all that we have seen[1516] of symmetrical\r\ndistricts and reductions of hidage, we ought not to take fright at this\r\npoint. Other people besides the writer of this list may have been\r\npossessed by a theory which connected hides with hundreds, and they may\r\nhave been people who were able to give effect to their theories by\r\ndecreeing how many hides a district must be deemed to contain. Is it not\r\neven possible that we have here, albeit in faded characters, one of\r\ntheir decrees? But the history of the hundreds can not be discussed in a\r\nparenthesis. Some further corroboration this County Hidage will receive\r\nwhen hereafter we set it beside The Burghal Hidage, and we may then be\r\nable to carry Worcester's 1200 and Oxford's 2400 hides far back into the\r\ntenth century.\r\n\r\n[Comparison of Domesday hidage with Pipe Rolls.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, making use of our terms 'equally rated' (_A_ = _B_),\r\n'over-rated' (_A > B_), and 'under-rated' (_A_ < _B_), let us briefly\r\nsurvey the counties as they stand in Domesday. Some help towards an\r\nestimation of their hidage is given to us by those few Pipe Rolls of the\r\ntwelfth century which contain accounts of a danegeld. But we must not at\r\nonce condemn as false the results of our own arithmetic merely because\r\nthey do not square with the figures on these rolls. One instance will be\r\nenough to prove this. The Henries have to be content with £166 or\r\nthereabouts from Yorkshire, or, in other words, to treat it as having\r\n1660 'carucates for geld.' We give it a little more than 10,000 and\r\nshall not admit that we have given it 8000 too many. This poor, wasted\r\ngiant has been relieved and has been set below little Surrey. So again,\r\nthough Leicestershire will account to Henry I. and his grandson for but\r\n£100, it most certainly had more than 1000 and more than 2000 carucates\r\nwhen William's commissioners visited it. On the other hand, there seem\r\nto be cases in a small group of counties in which his sons were able to\r\nrecover a certain amount of geld which had been, rightfully or\r\nwrongfully, withheld or forborne during his own reign. But, taking the\r\ncounties in mass, we hope that our figures are sufficiently consonant\r\nwith those upon the Pipe Rolls. Absolutely consonant they ought not to\r\nbe, for we have endeavoured to include the hides that are privileged\r\nfrom gelding, and in some shires (Hereford, for example) their number is\r\nby no means small. Also some leakage in an old tax may always be\r\nsuspected, and the Pipe Rolls themselves show some unexplained\r\nvariations in the amount for which a sheriff accounts, and some\r\narithmetical errors[1517].\r\n\r\nBut now we will make our tour and write brief notes as we go.\r\n\r\n[Under-rated and over-rated counties.]\r\n\r\nKent is scandalously under-rated. Of this there can be no doubt, though,\r\nsince in many cases blanks are left where the number of the teamlands\r\nshould stand, the figures can not be fully given. There has in a few\r\ninstances been a reduction in the number of geldable sulungs since the\r\nConquest, but this does not very greatly affect the result. The\r\nunder-rating seems to be generally distributed throughout the county. It\r\nhad not been redressed in Henry I.'s day. Indeed on the Pipe Rolls Kent\r\nappears as paying but £105, while Sussex pays twice as much. Sussex,\r\nSurrey, Hampshire and Berkshire appear to have all been over-rated. In\r\nthe Conqueror's day, however, they shuffled off large numbers of their\r\ngeldant hides and were paying for considerably fewer hides than they had\r\nteamlands. Some part of this reduction was perhaps unauthorized. At any\r\nrate the sums that appear on the Pipe Rolls seem to show that in Surrey,\r\nHampshire and Berkshire more hides were gelding under Henry I. than had\r\nbeen recently gelding when the survey was made; but the recovery was not\r\nsufficient to restore the state of things that existed under the\r\nConfessor. Wiltshire, so far as we can see, has always been a sorely\r\nover-rated county. It obtains no reduction under William. In the Pipe\r\nRolls it stands at the very head of the counties. Dorset, taken as a\r\nwhole, is exceedingly fairly rated. Eyton seems to have made 2321 hides\r\nand 2332 teamlands; but if the royal demesne (much of which is\r\nunhidated) be left out on both sides of the account, there will be\r\nslight over-rating. Somerset is very much under-rated, even if no notice\r\nbe taken of the royal demesne. Devon is grossly under-rated. Cornwall is\r\nenormously under-rated. To all appearance considerably more than 1000\r\nteamlands have stood as 400 hides, and even this light assessment seems\r\nto be the work of the Conqueror, for in the Confessor's day the whole\r\ncounty seems to have paid for hardly more than 150 hides[1518].\r\nMiddlesex is decidedly over-rated; but Hertford, Buckingham, Oxford,\r\nGloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford are\r\nunder-rated. The ratio borne by hides to teamlands varies from county to\r\ncounty. We believe that it becomes small in Gloucester and Worcester and\r\nfalls much below 1:2 in Hereford[1519]. This ratio is very small again\r\nin Warwick, Stafford, Shropshire and Cheshire. The two sister counties\r\nof Northampton and Leicester have, as already said, been very\r\ndifferently treated. Northampton is escaping easily, while Leicester, if\r\nwe are not much mistaken, is over-rated[1520]. Then however the Pipe\r\nRolls show that before the end of Henry I.'s reign Leicester has\r\nsucceeded in largely reducing its geldability. We have seen reason to\r\nbelieve that a similar reduction had been made in Northamptonshire\r\nshortly before the compilation of Domesday Book. Derby is under-rated;\r\nNottingham is much under-rated. Lincoln, though under-rated, is an\r\ninstance of a county in which we long doubt whether the under-rating of\r\nsome will not be compensated by the over-rating of other estates. So far\r\nas we can tell, Yorkshire had been heavily over-rated; but then, the\r\nteamland of Yorkshire is very often a merely potential teamland, and we\r\ncan not be certain that the jurors will give to the waste vills as many\r\nteamlands as they had before the devastation. In the end a very small\r\nsum of geld is exacted.\r\n\r\n[Hidage and value.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen enough in the case of Northampton to make us hesitate\r\nbefore we decide that the arrangement of hides set forth by Domesday\r\nBook is in all cases very ancient. That book shows us two different\r\nassessments of Cornwall; it shows us Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and\r\nBerkshire relieving themselves or obtaining relief in the Conqueror's\r\ntime; it shows us some Cambridgeshire hundreds disburdened of their\r\nhides. But of the great reduction in Northamptonshire we should have\r\nlearnt nothing from its pages. Therefore in other cases we must be\r\ncautious, even in the scandalous case of Kent, for we can not tell that\r\nthere has not been a large reduction of its sulungs in quite recent\r\nyears. However, behind all the caprice and presumable jobbery, we can\r\nnot help fancying that we see a certain equitable principle. We have\r\ntalked of under-rating and over-rating as if we held that every teamland\r\nin the kingdom should pay a like amount. But such equality would\r\ncertainly not be equity. The average teamland of Kent is worth full\r\nthirty shillings a year; the average teamland of Cornwall is barely\r\nworth five; to put an equal tax on the two would be an extreme of\r\ninjustice. Now we have formed no very high estimate of the justice or\r\nthe statesmanship of the English witan, and what we are going to say is\r\nwrung from us by figures which have dissipated some preconceived ideas;\r\nbut they hardly allow us to doubt that the number of hides cast upon a\r\ncounty had been affected not only by the amount, but also by the value\r\nof its teamlands. If, starting at the east of Sussex, we journey through\r\nthe southern counties, we see that over-rating prevails in Sussex,\r\nSurrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Dorset. We see also that\r\nthe _valet_ of the average teamland stands rather above than below one\r\npound. We pursue our journey. The ratio that _A_ bears to _B_ begins to\r\ndecline rapidly and at the same time the _valets_ descend by leaps and\r\nbounds. When we have reached Devon we are in a land which could not with\r\nany show of justice be taxed at the same rate per acre as that which\r\nWiltshire might bear without complaint. Every test that we can apply\r\nshows the extreme poverty of the country that once was 'West Wales.'\r\nThat poverty continues through the middle ages. We look, for example, at\r\nthe contributions to the tax of 1341 and compare them with the acreage\r\nof the contributing counties. Equal sums are paid by 1020 acres in\r\nWiltshire, 1310 in Dorset, 1740 in Somerset, 3215 in Devon, 3550 in\r\nCornwall[1521]. We look at the subsidy of 1294[1522], and, in order that\r\nDevon and Cornwall may not be put at a disadvantage by moor and\r\nsea-shore, we take as our dividend the number of acres in a county that\r\nare now-a-days under cultivation[1523], and for our divisor the number\r\nof pence that the county pays. The quotients are, for Wiltshire 2·7, for\r\nDorset 2·8, for Somerset 2·5, for Devon 6·4, for Cornwall 5·2. Retaining\r\nthe same dividend, we try as a divisor the 'polls' for which a county\r\nwill answer in 1377[1524]. Cornwall here makes a better show; but\r\nDevonshire still displays its misery. The quotients are, for Wiltshire\r\n16, for Dorset 14, for Somerset 15, for Devon 27, for Cornwall 17. These\r\nfigures we have introduced because they support the inferences that we\r\nshould draw from the _valets_ and _valuits_ of Domesday Book, a study of\r\nwhich has convinced us that the distribution of fiscal hides has not\r\nbeen altogether independent of the varying value of land.\r\n\r\n[Connexion between hidage and value.]\r\n\r\nBut in order that we may not trust to vague impressions, let us set down\r\nin one column the number of hides (carucates or sulungs) that we have\r\ngiven to twenty counties and in another column the annual value of those\r\ncounties in the time of King Edward as calculated by Mr Pearson[1525].\r\n\r\n                  Hides,   Value    |             Hides,   Value\r\n                Carucates,  in      |           Carucates,   in\r\n                 Sulungs   Pounds   |            Sulungs   Pounds\r\n    Kent           1224     3954    | Oxford       2412     2789\r\n    Sussex         3474     3467    | Gloucester   2388     2855\r\n    Surrey         1830     1417    | Worcester    1189     1060\r\n    Berkshire      2473     2378    | Huntingdon    747      900\r\n    Dorset         2277     2564    | Bedford      1193     1475\r\n    Devon          1119     2912    | Northampton  1356     1407\r\n    Cornwall        399      729    | Leicester    2500      491\r\n    Middlesex       868      911    | Warwick      1338      954\r\n    Hertford       1050     1894    | Derby         679      631\r\n    Buckingham     2074     1785    | Essex        2650     4079\r\n                                    |             -----    -----\r\n                                    |             33240    38652\r\n\r\n[One pound one hide.]\r\n\r\nNo one can look along these lines of figures without fancying that some\r\nforce, conscious or unconscious, has made for 'One pound, one hide.' But\r\nwe will use another test, which is in some respects fairer, if in others\r\nit is rude. The total of the _valets_ or _valuits_ of a county sometimes\r\nincludes and sometimes excludes the profit that the king derives from\r\nboroughs and from county courts; also the rents of his demesne manors\r\nare sometimes stated in disputable terms. Therefore from every county we\r\nwill take eighty simple entries, some from the lands of the churches,\r\nsome from the fiefs of the barons, and in a large county we will select\r\nour cases from many different pages. In each case we set down the number\r\nof gelding hides (carucates, sulungs) and the _valuit_ given for the T.\r\nR. E.[1526]. Our method will not be delicate enough to detect slight\r\ndifferences; it will only suffice to display any general tendency that\r\nis at work throughout England and to stamp as exceptional any shires\r\nwhich widely depart from the common rule, if common rule there be. Using\r\nthis method we find the values of the hide (carucate, sulung) to have\r\nbeen as follows, our figures standing for pounds and decimal fractions\r\nof a pound. We begin with the lowest and end with the highest _valuit_.\r\n\r\n     Leicester 0·26, York 0·34, Surrey 0·68, Northampton 0·75, Wiltshire\r\n     0·77, Sussex 0·81, Chester 0·82, Warwick 0·84, Somerset 0·85,\r\n     Buckingham 0·86, Oxford 0·87, Dorset 0·88, Berkshire 0·89, Hereford\r\n     0·91, Gloucester 0·99, Lincoln 0·99, Derby 1·00, Huntingdon 1·02,\r\n     Shropshire 1·02, Bedford 1·09, Hampshire 1·10, Worcester 1·10,\r\n     Middlesex 1·15, Essex 1·41, Devon 1·52, Hertford 1·69, Cambridge\r\n     1·73, Nottingham 1·76, Kent 3·25, Cornwall 3·92.\r\n\r\n[Equivalence of pound and hide.]\r\n\r\nNow 'One pound, one hide' seems to be the central point of this series,\r\nthe point of rest through which the pendulum swings. Our experiment has\r\nbeen much too partial to tell us whether a shire is slightly over-taxed\r\nor slightly undertaxed; but, unless we have shamefully blundered, it\r\ntells us that in some twenty out of thirty counties the aberration from\r\nthe equivalence of pound and hide will not exceed twenty five per\r\ncent.: in other words, the value of the normal hide will not be less\r\nthan 15 nor more than 25 shillings. Also we have brought our counties\r\ninto an admirable disorder. We have snapped all bonds of race and of\r\nneighbourhood. For example, we see the under-taxed Hampshire in the\r\nmidst of over-taxed counties; we have divorced Nottingham from Derby and\r\nLeicester from Northampton. The one general remark that we can make\r\nabout the geographical distribution of taxation is that, if East Anglia\r\nis under-taxed (and this is likely), then Kent, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk,\r\nCambridge and Hertford would form a continuous block of territory that\r\nis escaping easily.\r\n\r\n[Cases of under-taxation.]\r\n\r\n[Kent.]\r\n\r\nThe markedly exceptional cases are the most interesting. First let us\r\nlook at the worst instances of immunity. In Kent we seem to see\r\n'beneficial hidation' on a gigantic scale; but on the whole, though the\r\nevidence is not conclusive, we do not think that this is due to any\r\nmodern privilege. We can not doubt that for a long time past the Kentish\r\nchurches have been magnificently endowed, and yet the number of manses\r\nand sulungs that their land-books bestow upon them is not very large,\r\nand the number attributed to any one place is usually small, perceptibly\r\nsmaller than the number of hides that will be comprised in a West Saxon\r\ncharter. If a royal land-book condescends to mention acres (_iugera,\r\nsegetes_)[1527] it will almost certainly be a Kentish charter, and we\r\nmay guess that its acres are already fiscal acres of wide extent. To say\r\nmore would be perilous. The title-deeds of Christ Church can not be\r\nreadily harmonized with Domesday Book[1528]; perhaps we ought to add\r\nthat this is much to their credit; but the documents which come to us\r\nfrom St. Augustin's and Rochester suggest that the arrangement of\r\nsulungs which exists in the eleventh century is ancient, or, at any\r\nrate, that the monks knew of no older computation which dealt out these\r\nunits with a far more lavish hand[1529]. In Kent the churches were\r\npowerful and therefore may have been able to preserve a scheme of\r\nassessment which unduly favoured a rich and prosperous shire; but we can\r\nnot be certain that the hide and the Kentish sulung have really had the\r\nsame starting-point, nor even perhaps that Kent was settled village-wise\r\nby its Germanic invaders[1530].\r\n\r\n[West Wales.]\r\n\r\nDevon and Cornwall ought to be 'under-rated' (_A_ < _B_) for they are\r\nvery poor. What we find is that they are so much under-rated that the\r\nhide is worth a good deal more than a pound. Here again we are inclined\r\nto think that this under-rating is old, perhaps as old as the subjection\r\nof West Wales. Such land-books as we obtain from this distressful\r\ncountry point in that direction, for they give but few hides and\r\ncondescend to speak of virgates[1531]. Among them is a charter\r\nprofessing to come from Æthelstan which bestows 'one manse' upon the\r\nchurch of St. Buryan; but clearly this one manse is a wide tract. Also\r\nthis would-be charter speaks to us of land that is measured by the\r\narpent, and, whether or no it was forged by French clerks after the\r\nNorman Conquest, it may tell us that this old Celtic measure has been\r\ncontinuously used in the Celtic west[1532]. Be that as it may, when we\r\nare speculating about the under-taxation of Devon and Cornwall, we may\r\nremember that where the agrarian outlines were drawn by Welsh folk, the\r\nhide, though it might be imposed from above as a piece of fiscal\r\nmachinery, would be an intruder among the Celtic trevs and out of\r\nharmony with its environment. The light taxation of Cambridgeshire is\r\nperhaps more wonderful, for our figures represent the hidage of the\r\nConfessor's time, and we have seen[1533] how some of the hundreds in\r\nthis prosperous shire (our champion wheat-grower) obtained a large\r\nabatement from the Conqueror[1534]. If, in accordance with The County\r\nHidage, we doubled the number of Cambridgeshire's hides, though it would\r\nbe over-taxed, it would not be so heavily taxed as are some other\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\n[Cases of over-taxation.]\r\n\r\nExtreme over-taxation is far more interesting to us at the present\r\nmoment than extreme under-taxation. The latter may be the result of\r\nprivilege, and in the middle ages privileges will be accorded for value\r\nreceived in this world or promised in another. But what are we to say of\r\nLeicester? On the face of our record it seems to have been in Edward's\r\nday the very poorest of all the counties and yet to have borne a\r\ncrushing number of carucates. Under William it was beginning to prosper\r\nbut still was miserably poor[1535]. We have bethought ourselves of\r\nvarious devices for explaining this difficult case--of saying, for\r\ninstance, that the Leicestershire 'carucate of land' is not a carucate\r\nfor geld[1536]. But this case does not stand quite alone. The Yorkshire\r\ncarucates, and they are expressly called 'carucates for geld,' had been\r\nworth little. It is likely that the figure that we have given for\r\nYorkshire is not very near the true average for that wide territory; but\r\nwe examined an unusually large number of entries and avoided any which\r\nshowed signs of devastation in the present or the past. Also we see that\r\nin Northamptonshire, if we take the Edwardian _valuit_ and the number of\r\nhides existing in 1086, we have an over-taxed county; and yet we have\r\nreason to believe that since 1075 it had been relieved of about half its\r\nhides. Had this not been done, it would have stood along with Yorkshire,\r\nand, if it once had those 3200 of which The County Hidage speaks, it\r\nwould have stood along with its sister, the wretched Leicestershire. We\r\nmight find relief in the supposition that the Leicestershire of Edward's\r\ntime had been scourged by war or pestilence; but unfortunately the\r\njurors often tell us how many teams were then upon the manors, and in so\r\ndoing give a marvellously small value to the land that one team tilled.\r\nSuch reports as the following are common[1537].\r\n\r\n                             Teams     Teams     Valuit   Valet\r\n                 Carucates  T.

They can not mean that a tract of land was\r\nbeing habitually tilled by three teams and yet was producing in the form\r\nof profit or rent no more than the worth of one or two shillings a year.\r\nAn organized attempt to deceive King William into an abatement seems out\r\nof the question, for he is being told of a rapid increase of prosperity.\r\nOur best, though an unwarranted, guess is that the Leicestershire\r\n_valuit_ speaks not of the Confessor's day, but of some time of disorder\r\nthat followed the Conquest, for in truth it seems to give us but\r\n'prairie values.' However, if we take, not the _valuit_, but the\r\n_valet_, we still have carucates that are worth much less than a pound,\r\nand it seems clear that the carucate had been worth much less than a\r\npound in the as yet unravaged Yorkshire. On the whole, these cases,\r\ntogether with what we can learn of Lancashire, will dispose us to\r\nreceive with more favour than we might otherwise have shown certain\r\nstatements about the hidage of England that have yet to be adduced. In\r\nYorkshire, Lancashire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire we may\r\nperhaps see the unreformed relics of an age when the distribution of\r\nfiscal units among the various provinces of England was the sport of\r\nwild guesswork[1538].\r\n\r\n[Equity and hidage.]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of a tendency on the part of the hide to be worth a\r\npound. Now we have no wish to represent this equitable element as all\r\npowerful or very powerful; the case of Kent is sufficient to show that\r\nit may be overruled by favouritism or privilege. There has been a\r\n'beneficial hidation' of shires as there has been a 'beneficial\r\nhidation' of manors. Still that the kings and witan have considered the\r\nvalue as well as the number of teamlands seems fairly plain. Probably\r\nthey have considered it in a rough, 'typical' fashion. Any one who\r\nperuses Domesday Book paying attention to the _valets_ will be struck in\r\nthe first place by their roundness. If a teamland is not worth 20, it is\r\nworth 10 or 30, 5 or 40 shillings. The jurors seem to keep in their\r\nminds as types the 'one-pound-teamland,' the 'half-pound-teamland' and\r\nso forth. But then, whereas in one county 'twenty shillings' will stand\r\nfor 'fair average' and in another for 'rather poor,' in a third it will\r\nindicate unusual excellence. Similarly we imagine that when fiscal hides\r\nhave been distributed or redistributed, there has been talk of typical\r\nqualities of land, of first-rate and fourth-rate land. Any tradition of\r\nRoman taxation which had perdured in Britain or crossed the sea from\r\nFrankland would have taught men that this was the right method of\r\nprocedure. But it is by no means certain that we can carry back this\r\nequitable principle very far[1539]. Long ago the prevailing idea may\r\nhave been that teamland, house-land, pound-land and fiscal hide were, or\r\nought normally to be, all one; and then the discovery that there are\r\nwide tracts in which the worth of an average teamland is much less or\r\nsomewhat greater than a pound may have come in as a disturbing and\r\ndifferentiating force and awakened debates in the council of the nation.\r\nWe may, if we like such excursions, fancy the conservatives arguing for\r\nthe good old rule 'One teamland, one hide,' while a party of financial\r\nreformers has raised the cry 'One pound, one hide.' Then 'pressure was\r\nbrought to bear in influential quarters,' and in favour of their own\r\ndistricts the witan in the moots jobbed and jerrymandered and rolled the\r\nfriendly log, for all the world as if they had been mere modern\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n[Distribution of hides and of teamlands.]\r\n\r\nBut, to be serious, it is in some conjecture such as this that we may\r\nperchance find aid when we are endeavouring to loosen one of Domesday's\r\nworst knots. We have hinted before now[1540] that there are districts in\r\nwhich the teamland (_B_) seems to be as artificial and as remote from\r\nreal agrarian life as is the hide or the gelding carucate (_A_). To any\r\none who thinks that when we touch Domesday's teamland we have always\r\nfreed ourselves from the geld system and penetrated through the rateable\r\nto the real, the following piece of the survey of Rutland may be\r\ncommended. 'In Martinesleie Wapentake there is a hundred in which there\r\nare 12 carucates for geld and there can be 48 teams.' Now there is\r\nnothing curious in the fact that 48 'real' teamlands are rated at 12\r\ncarucates. But let us look closer. Beside one smaller estate there are\r\nin this wapentake three manors. Their arrangement is this[1541]:--\r\n\r\n                Carucates            Villeins and    Demesne     Men's\r\n                for geld  Teamlands    bordiers       teams      teams\r\n  Ocheham           4         16         157            2          37\r\n  Hameldune         4         16         153            5          40\r\n  Redlinctune       4         16         196[1542]      4          30\r\n    Subtenancy                            24            4           5\r\n                 ----       ----        ----           ------  ------\r\n                                                              \\/\r\n                   12         48         530                  127\r\n\r\nNow surely the three sixteens are just as artificial as the three fours,\r\nand in what possible sense can we affirm that there is land for only 48\r\nteams when we see that 530 tenants are actually ploughing it with 127\r\nteams? Behind this there must be some theory or some tradition that we\r\nhave not yet fathomed[1543].\r\n\r\n[Area and value as elements of geldability.]\r\n\r\nWe strongly suspect that in the work of distributing and reducing the\r\ngeld, 'the land for one team' has been playing a part for some time\r\npast. In order to decide, for example, whether a claim for abatement was\r\njust, the statesman had to consider two elements, the number of the\r\nteamlands and their value. He would be content with round figures,\r\nindeed no others would content him or be amenable to his rude\r\nmanipulation. So it is decided that some province or district has, or\r\nmust be deemed to have, _y_ teamlands. Also it is decided at this or at\r\nsome other time, or perhaps from time to time, that the land in this\r\ndistrict (regard being had to its state of cultivation) is or must be\r\ndeemed to be first-class, or, as the case may be, third-class land. Then\r\na combination of these propositions induces the conclusion that the\r\ndistrict has _x_ hides or carucates for geld. Then inside the district,\r\nwhen the process of subpartitionment begins, a similar method is\r\npursued. There are _x_ hides or carucates for geld to be distributed.\r\nThey ought to be distributed with reference to the number and value of\r\nreal teamlands. The work is rudely done in the subpartitionary fashion.\r\nA certain sub-district has _x/a_ hides thrown upon it; a\r\nsub-sub-district has _x/ab_; but this apportionment is obtained by\r\ncombining a proposition about value with a partitionment of the _y_\r\nteamlands. The sub-sub-district has _x/ab_ hides, because _y/cd_\r\nteamlands fall to its share and because its land is assigned to a\r\ncertain class. Then, perhaps for the purpose of future rearrangements,\r\nthe number of teamlands (_y/cd_) is remembered as well the number of\r\nhides or gelding carucates (_x/ab_). The result is that every manor in a\r\ncertain district has four hides and sixteen teamlands. It is very\r\npretty; it was never (except for technical purposes) very true, and\r\nevery year makes it less true[1544]. [Sidenote: The equitable\r\nteamland.]\r\n\r\nThat exactly this was done, we do not say and do not think; but\r\nsomething like it may have been done. As already remarked, we gravely\r\ndoubt whether that question which the commissioners put about potential\r\nteams was understood in the same way in different counties, but we are\r\nsadly afraid that some of the answers that they obtained were\r\nreferences, not to existing agrarian facts, but to a fiscal history\r\nwhich already lay in the past and is now hopelessly obscure. A mystery\r\nof iniquity is bad, but the mysteries of archaic equity are worse. In\r\nmany Anglo-Saxon arrangements we find a curious mixture of clumsiness\r\nand elaboration.\r\n\r\n[Artificial valets.]\r\n\r\nWe can not quit this part of our subject without adding that there are\r\ncases in which the _valuits_ and _valets_ look as artificial and\r\nsystematic as the hides and the teamlands. On a single page we find a\r\ndescription of five handsome Yorkshire manors[1545]. We wish to know\r\ntheir value in the past and the present, and what we learn is this:\r\nBrostewic valuit £56, valet £10; Chilnesse valuit £56, valet £10;\r\nWitfornes valuit £56, valet £6; Mapletone valuit £56, valet £6; Hornesse\r\nvaluit £56, valet £6; and yet between these manors there are large\r\nvariations in the number of the carucates and the number of the\r\nteamlands. Then we look about and see that it has been common for the\r\nfirst-class manor of Yorkshire, if it is the centre of an extensive\r\nsoke, to be worth precisely £56[1546]. We can not but fear that the\r\nvalue of these manors is a legal fiction, though a fiction that is\r\nfounded upon fact. Their supposed worth seems fixed at a figure that\r\nwill fit into some scheme, the clue to which we have not yet recovered.\r\nEverywhere we are baffled by the make-believe of ancient finance.\r\n\r\n[The new assessments of Henry II.]\r\n\r\nThe obscure forces which conspired to determine the quotas of the\r\nvarious counties might be illustrated by an episode in the reign of\r\nHenry II. The old danegeld is still being occasionally levied, and in\r\nthe main the old assessment prevails. But alongside of this we see a\r\nnewer tax. From time to time the king takes a gift (_donum_, _assisa_,\r\n_gersuma_) from the counties. A certain round number of marks is\r\ndemanded from every shire. For this purpose a new tariff is employed,\r\nand yet it is not wholly independent of the old, for we can hardly look\r\nat it without seeing that it is so constructed as to redress in a rude\r\nfashion the antiquated scheme of the danegeld. In the first column of\r\nthe following table we give, omitting fractions, the pounds that the\r\ncounties contribute when a danegeld is levied, in the second and third\r\nthe half-marks (6_s._ 8_d._) that they pay by way of gift on two\r\ndifferent occasions early in the reign of Henry of Anjou[1547].\r\n\r\n               Danegeld        Donum of              Donum of\r\n                               2 Hen.

Yorkshire, which once more is\r\nbecoming prosperous, heads the new list, though it pays less geld than\r\nSurrey; and, on the other hand, Wiltshire, which makes the largest of\r\nall contributions to the ancient tax, is leniently treated. When men\r\nhave acquired a vested right in an iniquitous assessment, the fertile\r\npolitician neither reforms nor abolishes the old, but invents a new\r\nimpost.\r\n\r\n[Acreage of the fiscal hide.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, after all these inconclusive meanderings, we will state our\r\ncheerful belief that the hide of Domesday (_A_) is always[1549] composed\r\nof 120 acres and that the carucate for geld of Domesday (_A_) is always\r\ncomposed of 120 acres. We are speaking only of a fiscal system. Let us\r\nforget for a time that the terms that we are using can be employed to\r\ndescribe masses of land. Let us treat them as red and white counters. In\r\nthe game played at the Exchequer the red counter called a hide is the\r\nequivalent of 120 white counters called acres.\r\n\r\n[Equation between hide and acres.]\r\n\r\nIf Domesday Book is to serve its primary purpose, if it is to tell the\r\nking's officers how much geld is due, it is absolutely necessary that by\r\nsome ready process they should be able to work sums in hides and acres\r\nand in carucates and acres. They must understand such statements as the\r\nfollowing:--'it defends itself for 2 hides and 5 acres[1550]': 'it\r\ngelded for 3 hides, 1 virgate and 1-1/2 acres[1551]': 'he has 5 bovates,\r\n13 acres and 1 virgate for geld[1552].' Now it is conceivable that the\r\ntreasury contains a book of tables which will teach the clerks that a\r\nhide has _a_ acres in Surrey and _b_ acres in Devon; but this seems\r\nhighly improbable. As we have already said[1553], the variations between\r\nthe numbers of 'real' acres that go to make 'real' hides are not\r\nprovincial, they are villar variations. That the financiers at\r\nWinchester should consider villar variations is out of the question.\r\nTherefore if we can prove that in one district they employed a given\r\nequation, there is a strong presumption that they used it in other\r\ndistricts. And unfortunately our proof has to be of this kind, for in\r\nmany counties acres are rarely mentioned and we get no sums that are\r\nworked in acres and hides. But further, if we see one equation holding\r\ngood in a considerable number of cases, we shall still believe that this\r\nis the one true equation, though other cases occur in which it breaks\r\ndown. We have to remember the possibility of mistranscription, the\r\npossibility of bad arithmetic, the possibility of a haughty treatment of\r\nsmall numbers: the actual existence of all these dangers can be amply\r\nproved. Therefore if once we have inductively obtained an equation which\r\nserves in many instances, we shall hold by it, unless the instances in\r\nwhich it fails point either to some one other equation or to the\r\nconclusion that the equation varies from parish to parish.\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Cambridgeshire.]\r\n\r\nNow the Cambridgeshire Inquest professes to give us the total hidage of\r\na vill and then proceeds to allot the hides among the various tenants in\r\nchief. Sometimes when it does this it speaks of virgates and acres and\r\nthus gives us an opportunity of seeing how many acres are reckoned to\r\nthe hide or to the virgate. The equation 1 H. = 4 V. is implied in many\r\nentries. But further, there are at least ten cases which assume one or\r\nboth of the following equations: namely, 1 H. = 120 A. and 1 V. = 30 A.\r\nOn the other hand, there are some cases in which the sum that is put\r\nbefore us is not rightly worked if these equations be correct; but in\r\nsome of these cases the Inquisitio and Domesday Book contradict each\r\nother and in some a small quantity is neglected. The very few remaining\r\ncases point to no one rival equation, and are not too numerous to be\r\nascribed to carelessness[1554].\r\n\r\n[Evidence from the Isle of Ely.]\r\n\r\nA similar test can be applied to a part of Cambridgeshire that is not\r\nincluded in the Cambridgeshire Inquest but is included in the Inquisitio\r\nEliensis. We speak of the Isle of Ely. There are entries which, having\r\ntold us how many hides a manor contained, proceed to allot these among\r\ntheir various occupants, and, as in some of these cases a calculation by\r\nacres is mixed up with a calculation by hides, they hold out a hope that\r\nwe may be able to discover how many acres were reckoned to the hide. We\r\nwill begin with Ely itself. 'Ely defends itself for 10 hides.... In\r\ndemesne there are 5 hides ... and there are 40 villeins with 15 acres\r\napiece ... and 18 cottiers and 20 serfs[1555].' Now if from the total of\r\n10 hides we subtract the 5 that are in demesne, this leaves 5 others,\r\nand if we divide these 5 among the 40 villeins this gives to each\r\nvillein 1/8th of a hide; but we are told that each villein has 15 acres;\r\ntherefore it follows that 120 acres make a hide. We reckon that in eight\r\nother cases[1556] the same method of computation is followed, though in\r\none of these a hide divided among 17 villeins is said to give them 7\r\nacres apiece and this shows us how a single acre may be neglected in\r\norder to avoid a very ugly fraction[1557]. Against these cases must be\r\nset seven which give less pleasing results[1558]. In at least one of\r\nthese no possible theory will justify the arithmetic of our record as it\r\nstands[1559], and there is no accord between the remaining five.\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Middlesex.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight the survey of Middlesex seems to offer materials similar\r\nto those that come to us from Cambridgeshire. Very curious and\r\ninstructive they are. A Middlesex entry will usually give us the number\r\nof hides (_A_), the number of teamlands (_B_), the number of teams\r\n(_C_), and also certain particulars which state the quantity of land\r\nthat there is in demesne and the quantities held by divers classes of\r\ntenants. The sum of these particulars we may call _P_. Now we begin by\r\nhoping that _P_ will be equal to _A_, and, since the particulars often\r\ncontain acres as well as hides and virgates, we hope also to discover\r\nthe equation that is involved in the sum. As an example we will take a\r\ncase in which all goes well. At Cowley a manor defends itself for two\r\nhides; in demesne are one and a half hides; two villeins have a half\r\nhide. Here _A_ = 2 H. and _P_ = 1-1/2 H. + 1/2 H.; so all is as it\r\nshould be. But we soon come upon cases in which, though we make no\r\nassumption about the relation of the acre to the hide, our _P_ refuses\r\nto be equal to our _A_. Then perhaps we begin to hope that _P_ will be\r\nequal to _B_: in other words, that the sum of the quantities ascribed to\r\nlord and tenants will be equal to the number of teamlands. But this is\r\nmore fallacious than the former hope. We will put a few specimens in a\r\ntable[1560].\r\n\r\n                             Hides  Teamlands    Sum of particulars\r\n  Harrow (Abp. Canterbury)    100       70     46-1/2 H. + 13 V. + 13 A.\r\n  Stepney (Bp. London)         32       25     18-1/2 H. + 48-1/2 V.\r\n  Fulham (Bp.

Take Chelsea for example. We must not say: 2 H. = 1 H. +\r\n4 V. + 5 A., and therefore four virgates and five acres make a hide. No,\r\nit seems possible that in these Middlesex 'particulars' we do at last\r\ntouch real agrarian arrangements. At Fulham the bishop has 13 hides in\r\ndemesne; 5 villeins have 1 hide apiece; 13 villeins have 1 virgate\r\napiece; 34 have a half-virgate apiece; 22 cottiers have in all a\r\nhalf-hide; Frenchmen and London burgesses have 23 hides; so there are\r\n41-1/2 hides and 30 virgates. That we take to be the real arrangement of\r\nthe manor, though we are far from saying that all its hides are equal.\r\nBut it gelds for only 40 hides. A virgate can not be a negative\r\nquantity. Therefore we need say no more of these Middlesex entries, only\r\nin passing let us observe that the discrepancy between _P_ and _B_ is\r\noften considerable, and this seems to show that the teamland of these\r\nMiddlesex jurors is not in very close touch with the agrarian and\r\nproprietary allotments.\r\n\r\n[Evidence in the Geld Inquests.]\r\n\r\nTo yet one other quarter we have hopefully turned only to be\r\ndisappointed, namely, to the so-called Geld Inquests, copies of which\r\nare placed at the beginning of the Exeter Domesday. They tell us of a\r\ngeld that obviously is being levied at the rate of six shillings on the\r\nhide, and sometimes they seem to tell us expressly or implicitly the\r\namount that an acre pays. For a moment we may think that we are\r\nobtaining valuable results. Thus at Domerham we find that 14 hides\r\nminus 4 acres pay £4. 3_s._ 8_d._ We conclude that each acre is taxed at\r\none penny and that 72 A. = 1 H.[1561]. Then at Celeberge 20 H. minus 4\r\nA. is taxed at £5. 19_s._ 6_d._ We conclude that each acre is taxed at\r\nthree-half-pence and that 48 A. = 1 H.[1562]. But we soon come to sums\r\nwhich are absurd and discover that as regards small quantities these\r\ndocuments are for our present purpose quite useless. For the Wiltshire\r\nhundreds we have three different documents. They do not agree in their\r\narithmetic. Probably they represent the efforts of three different\r\ncomputers. Indubitably one or more of them made blunders. To give one\r\nexample:--one of our documents begins its account of Mere by saying that\r\nit contains 85 hides, 1/2 a hide and 1/2 a virgate; the other two\r\ndocuments say 86 hides, 1/2 a hide and 1 virgate[1563]. This is by no\r\nmeans the only instance of such discrepant results. But mere clerical or\r\narithmetical errors are not the only obstacle to our use of these\r\naccounts. It soon becomes quite evident that small amounts are dealt\r\nwith in an irregular fashion. Thrice over we are assured that 15 H. 1/2\r\nV. paid the king £4. 11_s._ 0_d._[1564]; but they should have paid £4.\r\n10_s._ 9_d._, if four virgates make a hide. Thrice over we are assured\r\nthat 64-1/2 H. paid £19. 6_s._ 10_d._[1565]. All suppositions as to\r\nacres and virgates apart, 64-1/2 H. should have paid £19. 7_s._ 0_d_ In\r\nSomersetshire the calculations do not speak of acres, but they introduce\r\nus to the _fertinus_ or farthing, which is certainly meant to be the\r\nquarter of a virgate. Numerous entries show us that 4 _fertini_ = 1\r\nvirgate, and yet when a mass of land expressed in terms of hides,\r\nvirgates and farthings is said to pay a certain sum for geld, we find\r\nthat the odd farthings are reckoned as paying, sometimes 3_d._,\r\nsometimes 4_d._, sometimes 4-2/3_d._, sometimes 5_d._, sometimes 6_d._\r\nper farthing[1566]. So again, when additions are made, odd acres are\r\nignored. We are told that in a certain hundred the barons have 20 hides\r\nin demesne, and then that this amount is made up by the following\r\nparticulars, 8 H. + 1 V. + 3 H. + 3 V + 4-1/2 H. - 4 A. + 3-1/2 H. It is\r\nobvious that these particulars when added together do not make 20 hides,\r\nthough they may well make 20 hides and 4 acres[1567]. A study of these\r\nGeld Inquests has brought us reluctantly to the conclusion that, though\r\nthey amply prove that 4 V. = 1 H., they afford no proof as to the number\r\nof acres that are reckoned to the virgate[1568].\r\n\r\n[Treatment of small quantities.]\r\n\r\nOne word to explain that the apparent rudeness with which small figures\r\nare treated is not due to any persuasion that they may be safely\r\ndisregarded, but is rather the natural outcome of a partitionary method\r\nof taxation. Little quantities are lost in the process. It is known that\r\na certain hundred should have, for example, 80 hides and a certain vill\r\n5 hides: but when you come to add up the particulars you can not bring\r\nout these round figures, perhaps because many years ago a small error\r\nwas made by some one when an estate of 2-3/4 hides was being divided\r\ninto 7 shares. If a mistake be made, it can never be corrected; the\r\nlandowner who has once or twice paid for 47 acres will refuse to pay for\r\n48 and will tell you that the deficient acre does not lie on his land.\r\n\r\n[Result of the evidence.]\r\n\r\nThe ignes fatui which dance over the survey of Middlesex and the Geld\r\nInquests of the south-western counties have for a while led us from our\r\nstraight path. We have seen that in Cambridgeshire the equation 1 H. = 4\r\nV. = 120 A. is employed on at least twenty occasions. Now as to the rest\r\nof England it must at once be confessed that we have no such convincing\r\nevidence. In many counties acres of arable land are but rarely\r\nmentioned; parcels of land which geld for less than a hide are generally\r\nexpressed in terms of hides and virgates; we read, for example, not of\r\nso many acres, but of the ninth part of a hide or of two third parts of\r\na virgate. Thus we are compelled for the more part to fall back upon the\r\npresumption that the treasury has but one mode of reckoning for the\r\nwhole of England.\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Essex.]\r\n\r\nBut we would not rest our case altogether upon probability. In Essex we\r\nfind one fairly clear case in which our equation is used[1569].\r\nSometimes, again, we read that a tract of land is, or gelds for, or\r\ndefends itself for _x_ hides and _z_ acres, or for _x_ hides, _y_\r\nvirgates and _z_ acres. Now in any entry which takes the first of these\r\nforms we have some evidence that _z_ acres are less than one hide, and\r\nfrom any entry which takes the second of these forms we may infer that\r\n_z_ acres are less than one virgate. Of course from such a statement as\r\nthat '_A_ holds 90 or 115 or 240 acres' we draw no inference. It is\r\ncommon enough in our own day to speak of things costing thirty shillings\r\nor eighteen pence. But we never speak of things costing one pound and\r\nthirty shillings, or one shilling and eighteen pence, and we should\r\nrequire much proof before we thought so meanly of our ancestors as to\r\nsuppose that they habitually spoke in this clumsy fashion.\r\n\r\nLet us use this test. Happily in Essex we very frequently have a tract\r\nof land described as being _x_ hides and _z_ acres.\r\n\r\nNow we read of\r\n\r\n          a half hide and 30 acres[1570],\r\n          a hide and a half and 31 acres[1571],\r\n          a half hide and 35 acres[1572],\r\n          a half hide and 37 acres[1573],\r\n          a hide and a half and 40 acres[1574],\r\n          a hide and a half and 45 acres[1575],\r\n          a half hide and 45 acres[1576],\r\n          two hides and a half and 45 acres[1577],\r\n          a half hide and 48 acres[1578],\r\n          _x_ hides and 80 acres[1579],\r\n          nine hides and 82 acres[1580].\r\n\r\nWe have here cited twenty instances in which, as we think, the hide\r\nexceeds 60 acres (we might have cited many others) and twelve in which\r\nit exceeds 80 acres. We might further adduce instances in which our\r\nrecord speaks of a virgate and 10 acres, a virgate and 15 acres, and\r\neven of a virgate and 20 acres[1581], and when we read of two hides less\r\n30 acres and two hides less 40 acres[1582] we infer that a hide probably\r\nhas not only more but considerably more than the 30, 40 or 48 acres\r\nthat are allowed to it by Kemble and Eyton. Our argument is based on the\r\nbelief that men do not habitually adopt extremely cumbrous forms of\r\nspeech. From a single instance we should draw no inference, and\r\ntherefore when we just once read of 'three hides and a half and 80\r\nacres' we do not infer that 80 acres are less than half a hide[1583].\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Essex continued.]\r\n\r\nBut more can be made of these returns from Essex. We will take a large\r\nnumber of tracts of land described in the formula '_x_ hides and _z_\r\nacres'; we will observe the various numbers for which _z_ stands, and if\r\nwe find some particular number frequently repeating itself we shall be\r\nentitled to argue that this number of acres is some very simple fraction\r\nof a hide. We will take at hazard 100 consecutive entries which contain\r\nthis formula--'_x_ hides + _z_ acres,' where _x_ is either an integral\r\nnumber or 1/2. The result is that in 37 cases _z_ is 30, in 12 it is 15,\r\nin 8 it is 40; then 35 and 20 occur 5 times; 80, 50, 45, 37, 18, 10\r\noccur thrice, and 38 and 15-1/2 twice; eleven other numbers occur once\r\napiece. There can we think be but one explanation of this. The hide\r\ncontains that number of acres of which 30 is the quarter, 40 the third,\r\n15 the eighth[1584].\r\n\r\n[Further evidence.]\r\n\r\nBut Essex, it must be confessed, lies next to Cambridgeshire, and for\r\nthe rest of England we have less evidence. Still there are entries which\r\nmake against any theory which would give to the hide but 30, 40 or 48\r\nacres. In Hertfordshire we read of 'a hide and a half and 26\r\nacres[1585].' In the same county we read of 'a half virgate and 10\r\nacres,' and this seems to tell of a hide of at least 88 acres[1586]. In\r\nGloucestershire we read of a manor of one hide and are told that 'in\r\nthis hide, when it is ploughed, there are but (_non sunt nisi_) 64 acres\r\nof land,' whence we may draw the inference that such an acreage was\r\nunusually small[1587]. We pass from Mercia into Wessex. In\r\nSomersetshire we read of 'three virgates and a half and 5 acres[1588],'\r\nin Dorset of 'three virgates and a half and 7 acres[1589],' in Somerset\r\nof 'one and a half virgates and 8 acres[1590].'\r\n\r\n[Acreage of the fiscal carucate.]\r\n\r\nTo prove that the fiscal carucate was composed of 120 (fiscal) acres is\r\nby no means easy. If, however, we have sojourned for a while in Essex\r\nand then cross the border, we can hardly doubt that in East Anglia the\r\ncarucate bears to the acres the relation that is borne by those hides\r\namong which we have been living. Norfolk and Suffolk are carucated\r\ncounties, but while in the other carucated counties it is usual to\r\nexpress the smaller quantities of land in terms of the bovate (8 bovates\r\nmaking one carucate) and to say nothing of acres, in East Anglia, on the\r\nother hand, it is uncommon to mention the bovate--in Suffolk we may even\r\nfind the virgate[1591]--and men reckon by carucates, half-carucates and\r\nacres. We allow the description of Suffolk to fall open where it pleases\r\nand observe a hundred consecutive cases in which a plot of land (as\r\ndistinguished from meadow) is spoken of as containing a certain number\r\nof acres. In 22 cases out of the hundred that number is 60, in 8 it, is\r\n30, in 7 it is 20, in 5 it is 40, in 5 it is 15; no other number occurs\r\nmore than 4 times, and yet the numbers that appear range from 100 to 2.\r\nWe have tried the same experiment on two hundred cases in Norfolk; in 28\r\ncases the number of acres was 30, in 16 cases it was 60, in 13 it was\r\n40, in 13 it was 16, in 12 it was 20, in 10 it was 80, in 9 it was 15,\r\nthough the numbers ranged from 1 to 405. Surely the explanation of this\r\nmust be that 60 acres are half a carucate, that 30 acres are a quarter,\r\nthat 40 acres are a third, 20 a sixth, 15 an eighth. We have made many\r\nsimilar experiments and always with a similar result; wherever we open\r\nthe book we find plots of 60 acres and of 30 acres in rich abundance. We\r\nuse another test. When land is described by the formula '_x_ carucatae\r\net _z_ acrae,' what values are assigned to _z_? We find 40 very\r\ncommonly, 42, 45, 50, 60 (but this is rare, for it is easier to say\r\n'_x_-1/2 carucates' than '_x_ carucates and 60 acres') 68, 69, 80 (at\r\nleast four times), 81, and 100[1592]. On the one hand, then, we have a\r\ngood deal of evidence that the carucate contains more than 80 acres,\r\nsome evidence that it contains more than 100 acres, and some that it\r\ndoes not contain many more, for no case have we seen in which _z_\r\nexceeds 100. Perhaps in Norfolk the figure 16 occurs rather more\r\nfrequently than our theory would expect, but 16 is two-fifteenths of\r\n120, and the figures 32 and 64 occur but rarely. Also it must be\r\nconfessed that in Derbyshire we hear of 'eleven bovates and a half and\r\neight acres,' also of 'twelve bovates and a half and eight acres[1593].'\r\nThese entries, to use an argument which we have formerly used in our own\r\nfavour, seem to imply that half a bovate is more than eight acres and\r\nwould therefore give us a carucate of at least 144. We can only answer\r\nthat, though men do not habitually use clumsy modes of reckoning, they\r\ndo this occasionally[1594].\r\n\r\n[Acreage of the fiscal sulung.]\r\n\r\nOf the Kentish sulung very little can be discovered from Domesday.\r\nApparently it was divided into 4 yokes (_iuga_)[1595] and the yoke was\r\nprobably divided into 4 virgates. We have indeed one statement\r\nconnecting acres with sulungs which some have thought of great\r\nimportance. 'In the common land of St. Martin [i.e. the land which\r\nbelongs to the _communitas_ of the canons of St. Martin] are 400 acres\r\nand a half which make two sulungs and a half[1596].' Thence, a small\r\nquantity being neglected, the inference has been drawn that the Kentish\r\nsulung was composed of 160 acres, while some would read '400 acres and a\r\nhalf' to mean 450 acres and would so get 180 acres for the sulung[1597].\r\nBut the entry deals with one particular case and it connects real acres\r\nwith rateable units:--the canons have 400-1/2 or more probably 450\r\nacres, which are rated at 2-1/2 sulungs. If we passed to another\r\nestate, we might find a different relation between the fiscal and the\r\nreal units. Kent was egregiously undertaxed and as a general rule its\r\nfiscal sulung will have many real acres. Turning to the cases in which\r\nthe geldability of land is expressed in terms of sulungs and acres, or\r\nyokes and acres, we can gather no more than that the sulung is greater\r\nthan 60 acres, so much greater that '3 sulungs less 60 acres[1598]' is a\r\nnatural phrase, and that the half-sulung is greater than 40[1599] and\r\nthan 42 acres[1600]. We may suspect that the Exchequer was reckoning 120\r\n(fiscal) acres to the sulung but can not say that this is proved.\r\n\r\n[Kemble's theory.]\r\n\r\nAnd now we must glance at certain theories opposed to that which has\r\nbeen here stated. Kemble contends that the hide contained 30 or 33 Saxon\r\nwhich were equal to 40 Norman acres, and that the hide of Domesday Book\r\ncontains 40 Norman acres[1601]. Now in so far as this doctrine deals\r\nwith the time before the Conquest, we will postpone our judgment upon\r\nit. So far as it deals with the Domesday hide, it is supported by two\r\narguments. One of these is to the effect that England has not room for\r\nall the hides that are attributed to it if the hide had many more than\r\n30 or 40 acres; this argument also we will for a while defer. The\r\nother[1602] is based on a single passage in the Exeter Domesday relating\r\nto the manor of Poleham. That entry seems to involve an equation which\r\ncan only be solved if 1 virgate = 10 acres. William of Mohun has a manor\r\nwhich in the time of King Edward paid geld for 10 hides; he has in\r\ndemesne 4 H., 1 V., 6 A. and the villeins have 5-1/2 H., 4 A.[1603] Now\r\nthree or four such entries would certainly set the matter at rest; but a\r\nsingle entry can not. By way of answer it will be enough to say that the\r\nvery next entry seems to imply an equation of precisely the same form,\r\nbut one that is plainly absurd. This same William has a manor called\r\nHam; it paid geld for 5 hides; there were 3 H., 8 A. in demesne and the\r\nvillains had 2 H. less 12 A. Shall we draw the conclusion that 5 H. = 5\r\nH. - 4 A.? The truth we suspect to be that here, as in Middlesex,\r\ngeldable units and actual areal units have already begun to perplex each\r\nother. Both Poleham and Ham are what we call 'over-rated' manors. It is\r\nknown that Poleham contains 10 hides and Ham 5 hides, but, when we come\r\nto look for the acres that will make up the due tale of hides, we can\r\nnot find them; for let King William's officers have never so clear a\r\nterminology of their own, the country folk will not for ever be\r\ndistinguishing between 'acres _ad geldum_' and 'acres _ad arandum_' But\r\nbe the explanation what it may, we repeat that the one equation that\r\nKemble could find to support his argument is found in the closest\r\ncompany with an equation which when similarly treated produces a\r\nnonsensical result. This is all the direct evidence that he has produced\r\nfrom Domesday Book in favour of the hide of 40 acres. Robertson, while\r\nholding that the hide of Mercia contained 120 acres, adopted Kemble's\r\nopinion that the hide of Wessex contained 40 without producing any\r\nwitness from Domesday save only the passage about Poleham[1604]. Eyton\r\nreckons 48 'gheld acres' to the 'gheld hide,' but he leaves us utterly\r\nat a loss to tell how he came by this computation[1605].\r\n\r\n[The ploughland and the plough.]\r\n\r\nAnother theory we must examine. It is ingenious and, were it true, would\r\nthrow much light on a dark corner. It starts from the facts disclosed by\r\nthe survey of the East Riding of Yorkshire[1606]. In that district, it\r\nis said, the number of carucates for geld that there are in any manor\r\n(this number we will call _a_) is usually either equal to, or just twice\r\nthe number (which we call _b_) of the 'lands for one plough,' or, as we\r\nsay, teamlands. Further, it can be shown from maps and other modern\r\nevidences that the manors in which _a = b_ were manors with two common\r\nfields, in other words, were 'two-course manors,' while those in which\r\n_a = 2b_ were manors with three common fields, in other words were\r\n'three-course manors.' The suggested explanation is that while the\r\nteamland or 'land for one plough' means the amount of land that one\r\nplough will till in the course of a year, the 'carucate for geld' is the\r\namount of land which one plough tills in one field in the course of a\r\nyear. Manor _X_, let us suppose, is a two-course manor; the whole amount\r\nof land which a plough will till there in a year will lie in one field;\r\ntherefore in this case _a = b_. Manor _Y_ is a three-course manor; in a\r\ngiven year a plough will there till a certain quantity of land, but half\r\nits work will have been done in one field, half in another; therefore in\r\nthis case _a = 2b_.\r\n\r\n[The Yorkshire carucates.]\r\n\r\nNow we must own to doubting the possibility of deciding with any\r\ncertainty from comparatively modern evidence which (if any) of the\r\nYorkshire vills were under a system of three-course culture in the\r\neleventh century. In the year 1086 many of them were lying and for long\r\nyears had lain waste either in whole or in part. Thus the first group of\r\nexamples that is put before us as the foundation for a theory consists\r\nof 15 manors the sum of whose carucates for geld is 91-1/4 while the sum\r\nof the teamlands is 91-3/4. What was the state of these manors in 1086?\r\nThree of them were absolutely waste. The recorded population on the\r\nothers consisted of four priests, one sokemean, eighty-four villeins and\r\ntwenty-six bordiers; the number of existing teams was 35-1/2; the total\r\n_valet_ of the whole fifteen estates was £7. 1_s._, though they had been\r\nworth £72 in King Edward's day[1607]. It is obvious enough that very\r\nlittle land is really being ploughed, and surely it is a most perilous\r\ninference that, when culture comes back to these deserted villages, the\r\nold state of things will be reproduced, so that we shall be able to\r\ndecide which of them had three and which had two fields in the days\r\nbefore the devastation. Further, we can not think that, even for the\r\nEast Riding of Yorkshire, the figures show as much regularity as has\r\nbeen attributed to them. In the first place, there are admittedly many\r\ncases in which neither of the two equations of which we have spoken (_a\r\n= b_ or _a = 2b_) is precisely true. We can only say that they are\r\napproximately true. Then there are other cases--too many, as we think,\r\nto be treated as exceptional--in which _a_ bears to _b_ some very simple\r\nratio which is neither 1:1 nor yet 2:1; it is 3:2, or 4:3, or 5:3.\r\n\r\n[Relation between teamlands and fiscal carucates.]\r\n\r\nBut at any rate, to extend the theory to the whole of Yorkshire, to say\r\nnothing of all England, is out of the question. No doubt as a whole\r\nYorkshire was (in the terms that we have used) an 'over-rated' county:\r\nthat is to say, as a general rule, _a_, if not equal to, was greater\r\nthan _b_. But it can not be said that when _a_ was not equal to _b_ it\r\nnormally was, or even tended to be equal to 2_b_. We take by chance a\r\npage describing the possessions of Count Alan[1608]; it contains 20\r\nentries; in one of these _a = b_, in one _a = 2b_, in one _b_ is greater\r\nthan _a_; in ten cases the proportion which _a_ bears to _b_ is 3:2, in\r\ntwo it is 4:3, in two it is 5:3, in one 6:5, in one 7:5, in one it is\r\n17:12. In the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham and Derby an application\r\nof this doctrine would be ludicrous, for very commonly _b_ is greater\r\nthan _a_. What is more, the method of taxation that it presupposes is so\r\nunjust that we are loath to attribute it to any one. To tax a man in\r\nproportion to the area of the land that he treats as arable, that is a\r\nplausibly equitable method; to tax him in proportion to the area that he\r\nhas ploughed in a given year, that also is a plausibly equitable method;\r\nbut the present proposal could only be explained as a deliberate effort\r\nto tax the three-field system out of existence[1609]. To take the\r\nfigures that have been suggested to us by the author of this theory, we\r\nsuppose that _X_ is using a team of oxen in 'a two-course manor'; he has\r\n160 acres of arable land and ploughs 80 of them in every year. Then in\r\nanother village _Y_ is using a team of oxen according to the\r\nthree-course system; he has, we are told, 180 acres of arable and\r\nploughs 120 acres in every year. This unfortunate _Y_ is to pay double\r\nthe amount of geld that is paid by _X_. We could understand a demand\r\nthat _Y_ should pay nine shillings when _X_ pays eight, for _Y_ has in\r\nall 180 acres of arable and _X_ has 160. We could understand a demand\r\nthat _Y_ should pay three shillings when _X_ pays two, for _Y_ sows 120\r\nacres a year and _X_ sows 80. But nothing short of a settled desire to\r\nextirpate the three-field system will prompt us to exact two shillings\r\nfrom _Y_ for every one that is paid by _X_. Lastly, we must repeat in\r\npassing our protest[1610] against the introduction into this context of\r\nthose figures which express the aspirations of that enthusiast of the\r\nplough, Walter of Henley. That the 'land for one team' of Domesday Book\r\npoints normally or commonly to an area of arable land containing 160 or\r\n180 acres we can not believe. If we give it on an average 120 acres we\r\nmay perhaps find room for the recorded team lands, though probably we\r\nshall often have to make our acres small; but county after county will\r\nrefuse to make room for teamlands with 160 or 180 acres[1611]. No doubt\r\nthe regularity of the Yorkshire figures is remarkable. There are other\r\ndistricts in northern England where we may see some one relation\r\nbetween _A_ and _B_ steadily prevailing. We will call to mind, by way of\r\nexample, the symmetrical arrangement that we have seen in one of the\r\nRutland wapentakes, where _A_ = 4_B_. This we can not explain, nor will\r\nit be explained until Domesday Book has been rearranged by hundreds and\r\nvills; we have, however, hazarded a guess as to the quarter in which the\r\nexplanation may be found[1612]. As to the Yorkshire figures, we think\r\nthat of all the figures in the record they are the least likely to be\r\ntelling us the simple truth about the amount of cultivated land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fiscal hide of 120 acres.]\r\n\r\nWe may now briefly recapitulate the evidence which leads us to the\r\nold-fashioned belief that King William's Exchequer reckons 120 acres to\r\nthe hide. There are at the least twenty sums set before us which involve\r\nthe equation: 1H. = 120A. or 1V. = 30A. We doubt whether there are two\r\nsums which involve any one other equation. That there are sums which\r\ninvolve or seem to involve other equations we fully admit; but when a\r\nfair allowance has been made for mistranscription, miscalculation, the\r\nloss of acres due to partitionary arrangements[1613], and, above all, to\r\na transition from the rateable to the real, from the hidage on the roll\r\nto the strips in the fields, we can not think that these cases are\r\nsufficiently numerous to shake our faith. We have further seen that in\r\nEssex and East Anglia the acres of the fiscal system lie in batches of\r\njust those sizes which would be produced if an unit of 120 acres was\r\nbeing broken into halfs, thirds, quarters and fifths. Lastly, 'the\r\nrustics' of the twelfth century 'tell us that the hide according to its\r\noriginal constitution consists of a hundred acres[1614]' and probably\r\nthese rustics reckon by the long hundred.\r\n\r\n[Antiquity of the large hide.]\r\n\r\nIf now we are satisfied about this matter, we seem to be entitled to\r\nsome inferences about remoter history. The fiscal practice of reckoning\r\n120 acres to the hide can hardly be new. Owing to many causes, among\r\nwhich we recall the partitionary system of taxation, the influence of an\r\nequity which would consider value as well as area, and the disturbing\r\nforces of privilege and favouritism, the fiscal hide of the Confessor's\r\nday has strayed far away from the fields and is no measure of\r\nland[1615]. At its worst it is jobbery; at its best a lame compromise\r\nbetween an unit of area and an unit of value. And yet, for all this, it\r\nis composed of acres, of 120 acres. The theory that is involved in this\r\nmode of calculation is so little in harmony with the existing facts that\r\nwe can not but believe that it is ancient. It seems to point to a time\r\nlong gone by when the typical tenement which was to serve as an unit of\r\ntaxation generally had six score arable acres, little more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1340] D. B. i. 307 b, 308.\r\n\r\n  [1341] It will be convenient for us to adopt this term a 'teamland'\r\n         as an equivalent for the _Terra ad unam carucam_ of our\r\n         record, so that '_b_ teamlands' shall translate _Terra ad b\r\n         carucas_.

As to its omissions see Eyton,\r\n         Notes on Domesday (1880); also Round, Feudal England, 43.\r\n\r\n  [1348] Agricultural Returns, 1895 (Board of Agriculture) p. 34.\r\n         Tidal water is excluded.\r\n\r\n  [1349] The received figures are: Middlesex, 149,046, London, 75,442.\r\n         From older sources we give Middlesex, 180,480: Population\r\n         Abstract, 1833, vol. i. p. 376.\r\n\r\n  [1350] For some good remarks on these matters see Eyton, Notes on\r\n         Domesday. Lincoln, Nottingham and Northampton would require\r\n         correction because of the treatment that Rutland has\r\n         received. The boundary of Shropshire has undergone changes.\r\n         The inclusion of stretches of Welsh ground increases the\r\n         population without adding to the hidage of some western\r\n         counties.\r\n\r\n  [1351] See above, p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [1352] Thus Leicester is charged with £100. 0_s._ 0_d._, with £99.\r\n         19_s._ 11_d._ and with £99. 19_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n  [1353] In 8 Hen. II. several of the counties answer for about £10\r\n         less than had formerly been demanded from them.\r\n\r\n  [1354] The inclusion of the boroughs would have led to many\r\n         difficulties. London, for example, though no account is taken\r\n         of it in D. B., seems to have gelded for 1200 hides. (Brit.\r\n         Mus. MS. Add. 14,252, f. 126.)\r\n\r\n  [1355] We omit the 'ingeldable carucates' which occur in some\r\n         hidated counties. This may introduce a little caprice. If the\r\n         jurors in one of these counties ascribe twelve carucates to a\r\n         manor, we do not count them. If they had spoken of hides\r\n         which never gelded, we should have counted them; and yet we\r\n         may agree with Eyton that the two phrases would mean much the\r\n         same thing. But this source of error or caprice is not very\r\n         important in our present context. Thus we take Dorset. Eyton\r\n         gives it 2321 hides and then by adding 'quasi-hides' brings\r\n         up the number to 2650. The difference between these two\r\n         figures is not large when regarded from the point that we are\r\n         occupying. I have thought that the difficulty would be better\r\n         met by the warning that Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset and Devon\r\n         contain considerable stretches of unhidated royal demesne,\r\n         than by my reckoning as hides what Eyton called\r\n         'quasi-hides.' In the case of Dorset, Somerset and Stafford I\r\n         have placed Eyton's figures below my own and signed them with\r\n         the letter _E_. I know full well that his are much more\r\n         accurate than mine. He probably gave to each county that he\r\n         examined more months than I have given weeks to the whole of\r\n         England. In comparing our results, it should be remembered\r\n         that, at least in Staffordshire, he dealt with the county\r\n         boundary in a manner which, in my ignorance, I dare not\r\n         adopt.\r\n\r\n  [1356] My calculations about Leicestershire are more than usually\r\n         rough, owing to the appearance of the curious 'hide' or\r\n         'hundred' or whatever it is. See on the one hand Stevenson,\r\n         E. H. R. v. 95, and on the other Round, Feudal England, 82.\r\n         Whether this unit contained 12 or 18 carucates is not of very\r\n         great importance to us at the moment. But there are other\r\n         difficulties in Leicestershire. In Cornwall I was compelled\r\n         to make an assumption as to the peculiar _ager_ or _acra_ of\r\n         that county; but no reasonable theory about this matter would\r\n         seriously affect the number of Cornwall's hides.\r\n\r\n  [1357] The usual formula is: 'Tunc se defendit pro _a_ hidis, modo\r\n         pro _a´_.' We place _a_ in Col. IV., _a´_ in Col. V.\r\n\r\n  [1358] The usual formula is: 'T. R. E. geldabat pro _a_ hidis; ibi\r\n         tamen sunt _a´_ hidae.' We place _a_ in Col. IV. and _a´_ in\r\n         Col. V.; and we shall argue hereafter, with some hesitation,\r\n         that the taxation of this county has been increased under\r\n         William.\r\n\r\n  [1359] The words _Terra est_ are written and are followed by a blank\r\n         space. Many instances in Kent and Sussex.\r\n\r\n  [1360] On the other hand, when I find a statement about _B_ and none\r\n         about _C_, I do not assume that _C_ = _B_; on the contrary, I\r\n         read the entry to mean that _C_ = 0. In other words, it is\r\n         very possible that there should be teamlands without teams;\r\n         but I do not think that for Domesday's purposes there can be\r\n         teams (i.e. teams at work) without land that is being\r\n         ploughed, though it is true that often, and in some counties\r\n         habitually, _C_ will be slightly greater than _B_.\r\n\r\n  [1361] One of the chief difficulties in the way of accurate\r\n         computation is occasioned by what we may call the complex\r\n         entries. We start with some such statement as this: 'The\r\n         Bishop holds Norton. It defends itself for _a_ hides. There\r\n         is land for _b_ teams. There are _d_ teams on the demesne and\r\n         the villeins have _e_ teams.' But then we read: 'Of this land\r\n         [_or_ of these _a_ hides] Roger holds _m_ hides; there are\r\n         _n_ teams on the demesne and the villeins have _o_ teams.'\r\n         Here the total number of hides is _a_, and not _a_ + _m_; and\r\n         I think that the total number of teamlands is _b_, and not\r\n         _b_ + some unstated number held by Roger; but the total\r\n         number of teams is _d_ + _e_ + _n_ + _o_. Entries in this\r\n         form are not very uncommon, and therefore this explanation\r\n         seemed to be required.\r\n\r\n  [1362] Pearson, History of England, ii. 665.\r\n\r\n  [1363] Col. IX. gives I. divided by II. Col. X. gives I. divided by\r\n         VI. Col. XI. gives I. divided by VII. Col. XII. gives II.\r\n         divided by VI. Col. XIII. gives II. divided by VII. Col. XIV.\r\n         gives VI. divided by VII. Col. XV. gives VIII. divided by VI.\r\n         [or if there is no VI. for this county, then by VII.].\r\n\r\n  [1364] In Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford and Shropshire I was\r\n         compelled to adopt as the divisor the number of teams instead\r\n         of the number of teamlands. As it is fairly certain that\r\n         these counties were 'underteamed' (_B_ > _C_), the resulting\r\n         quotient (annual value of land actually tilled by a team)\r\n         should be diminished before it is compared with the figures\r\n         given for other counties.\r\n\r\n  [1365] C. S. Taylor, Analysis of Gloucestershire Domesday (Bristol\r\n         and Gloucestershire Archaeol. Soc. 1887-9).\r\n\r\n  [1366] But this is intended to include males only: the _ancillae_\r\n         are left out.\r\n\r\n  [1367] Mr Taylor says in his preface: 'The work has occupied a large\r\n         part of my leisure time for five years.' There is therefore\r\n         some audacity in my printing my figures beside his. It is\r\n         clear that we have put different constructions upon some of\r\n         the composite entries concerning large manors. See below, p.\r\n         457. Mr Taylor, like Eyton, computes only 48 'geld acres' to\r\n         the hide; I reckon 120 acres to the hide; that, however, is\r\n         in this context a trifling matter.\r\n\r\n  [1368] Mr Taylor has brought out 15_s._ 5_d._ as the average _valet_\r\n         of land tilled by a team. By taking Pearson's _valet_ and my\r\n         teams I have brought out 15_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n  [1369] For Dorset and Somerset my figures can be checked by Eyton's.\r\n         For Wiltshire, Devon, Cornwall, by the Geld Inquests. These\r\n         give for Wiltshire (see W. H. Jones, Domesday for Wiltshire,\r\n         158 ff.) 3955 H. 3 V.; for Devon (see Devonshire Domesday,\r\n         ed. Devonsh. Assoc. p. xlix.) 1029 H. 1 V. 3 F.; for Cornwall\r\n         401 H. 3 V. 1 F. I give for Wiltshire 4050 H., for Devon 1119\r\n         H., for Cornwall 399 H.\r\n\r\n  [1370] Lincoln, 5·0; Nottingham, 4·4; Derby, 3·9; Surrey, 3·7;\r\n         Hampshire, 3·6; Middlesex, 3·4; Dorset, 3·3; Cambridge, 3·1;\r\n         Berkshire, 3·0; Wiltshire, 2·9; Hertford, Northampton,\r\n         Warwick, Somerset, 2·8; Huntingdon, 2·6; Oxford, 2·5; Bedford\r\n         and Buckingham, 2·4; Cornwall and Stafford, 2·2; Devon, 2·1.\r\n         For Kent the figure would be near 3·9, for Sussex near 3·3,\r\n         for apparently in these counties there was approximate\r\n         equality between the number of teams and the number of\r\n         teamlands.\r\n\r\n  [1371] One word about the meaning of the _valets_. I think it very\r\n         clear from thousands of examples that an estate is valued 'as\r\n         a going concern.' The question that the jurors put to\r\n         themselves is: 'What will this estate bring in, peopled as it\r\n         is and stocked as it is?' In other words, they do not\r\n         endeavour to make abstraction of the villeins, oxen, etc. and\r\n         to assign to the land what would be its annual value if it\r\n         were stocked or peopled according to some standard of average\r\n         culture. Consequently in a few years the value of an estate\r\n         may leap from one pound to three pounds or to five shillings\r\n         or even to zero. Eyton, Dorset, 56, has good remarks on this\r\n         matter.\r\n\r\n  [1372] Seebohm, Village Community, 85-6. To the contrary Round, in\r\n         Domesday Studies, i. 209, and Feudal England, 35.\r\n\r\n  [1373] Round, Feudal England, 35.\r\n\r\n  [1374] See e.g. D.

In dominio est una et 4 villani\r\n         habent aliam et tercia potest fieri.' Is this third team to\r\n         be a team of four or a team of eight?\r\n\r\n  [1382] Seebohm, Village Community, 85.\r\n\r\n  [1383] As a specimen we take 10 consecutive entries from the royal\r\n         demesne in Surrey in which it is said that _x_ villeins and\r\n         _y_ bordiers have _z_ teams. We add half of _y_ to _x_ and\r\n         divide the result by _z_. The quotients are 10·3, 4·0, 3·7,\r\n         3·5, 3·4, 2·7, 2·2, 1·9, 1·8, 1·4. If we massed the ten cases\r\n         together, the quotient would be 2·8. We can easily find\r\n         averages; but, even if we omit cases in which there is an\r\n         exceptional dearth of oxen, the variations are so\r\n         considerable that we must not speak of a type or norm.\r\n\r\n  [1384] Glastonbury Rentalia, 51-2: 'S. tenet 1 virgatam terre ... et\r\n         si habet 8 boves debet warectare ... 7 acras. Si autem\r\n         pauciores habet, warectabit pro unoquoque bove octavam partem\r\n         7 acrarum.' Ibid. 61: 'R. C. tenet unam virgatam ... et\r\n         habebit 4 boves cum bobus domini.'

I venture to think that Sir F.\r\n         Pollock has not answered his own argument (p. 220) for a\r\n         constant _caruca_.\r\n\r\n  [1388] Inq. Com. Cant. 70.\r\n\r\n  [1389] Another example from a Northamptonshire column (D. B. i. 226)\r\n         will show what we mean. Let H stand for hides and T for\r\n         teamlands, and let the virgate be a quarter of a hide, then\r\n         we have this series: 2 H (5 T), 2-1/2 H (4 T), 4 H (8 T),\r\n         1-1/4 H (3 T), 1-7/12 H (4 T), 3/8 H (1/2 T), 1/2 H (1 T),\r\n         2-1/2 H (6 T), 1-1/4 H (3 T), 2 H (4 T), 7/8 H (3 T). We see\r\n         that T is integral where H is fractional.\r\n\r\n  [1390] Exceptionally we read in Kent (i. 9): 'Terra est dim. car. et\r\n         ibidem sunt adhuc 30 acrae terrae.' And is not this a\r\n         rule-proving exception? The jurors can not say simply 'land\r\n         for half a team and thirty acres.' They say 'land for half a\r\n         team and there are thirty acres in addition.'\r\n\r\n  [1391] D. B. iv. 497; Inq. Com. Cant. 97.\r\n\r\n  [1392] There can be little doubt that this is the right reading. See\r\n         Round. Feudal England, 134.\r\n\r\n  [1393] Thus, D. B. ii. 39: 'Tunc 4 carucae in dominio, post et modo\r\n         2 ... et 2 carucae possunt restaurari.' To use our symbols,\r\n         in Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk we obtain statements about _A_\r\n         and about _C_, but learn nothing about _B_, unless this is to\r\n         be inferred from the increase or decrease that has taken\r\n         place in _C_. We shall hereafter argue that, in spite of some\r\n         appearances to the contrary, the carucates of East Anglia\r\n         belong to the order _A_ and not to the order _B_.\r\n\r\n  [1394] Thus, D. B. i. 231: 'Rad. tenet de episcopo 4 car. terrae in\r\n         Partenei. Terra est 4 car. In dominio sunt 2 et ... villani\r\n         habent 2 car.' Just before this we have the other common\r\n         formula: 'Rad. tenet ... 2 car. terrae in Toniscote. Duae\r\n         car. possunt esse et ibi sunt.'\r\n\r\n  [1395] Thus, D. B. i. 231 b: 'Ipsa Comitissa tenuit Dunitone. Ibi 22\r\n         car. et dimid. T. R. E. erant ibi 12 car. Modo in dominio\r\n         sunt 3 et ... villani ... habent 12 car.'\r\n\r\n  [1396] To me it looks as if the variations were due to a clerk's\r\n         caprice. The Leicestershire survey fills 30 columns. Not\r\n         until the top of col. 5 has the compiler, except as a rare\r\n         exception, the requisite information. Then, after hesitating\r\n         as to whether he shall adopt the '_x_ car. possunt esse'\r\n         formula, he decides in favour of 'Terra est _x_ car.' This we\r\n         will call Formula I. It reigns throughout cols. 5-13, though\r\n         broken on three or four occasions by what we will call\r\n         Formula II, namely 'T. R. E. erant ibi _x_ car.' At the top\r\n         of col. 14 Formula II. takes possession and keeps it into\r\n         col. 16. Then I. has a short turn. Then (col. 17) II. is back\r\n         again. Then follow many alternations. At the top of col. 24,\r\n         however, a simplified version of II. appears; the express\r\n         reference to the T. R. E. vanishes, and we have merely 'ibi\r\n         fuerunt _x_ car.' In the course of col. 26 this is changed to\r\n         'ibi _x_ car. fuerunt.' These two versions of II. prevail\r\n         throughout the last six columns, though there is one short\r\n         relapse to I. (col. 28).\r\n\r\n  [1397] The proof of this lies in the Inq. Com. Cant. and the Exon\r\n         Domesday.\r\n\r\n  [1398] This appears on a collation of D. B. with the two records\r\n         mentioned in our last note. See Round, Feudal England, 26.\r\n\r\n  [1399] D. B. i. 174: 'In omnibus his maneriis non possunt esse plus\r\n         carucae quam dictum est.'\r\n\r\n  [1400] When _C_ varies from _B_, the statement about _C_ will\r\n         sometimes be introduced by a _sed_ or a _tamen_ which tells\r\n         us that things are not what they might be expected to be. D.\r\n         B. i. 77 b: 'Terra est dimid. car. et tamen est ibi 1 car.'\r\n         D. B. i. 222: 'Terra est dim. car. tamen 2 villani habent 1\r\n         car.'\r\n\r\n  [1401] As a wheat-grower Devon stands in our own day at the very\r\n         bottom of the English counties. Its average yield per acre in\r\n         1885-95 was 21 bushels, while Cambridge's was 32. Next above\r\n         Devon stands Monmouth and then comes Cornwall.\r\n\r\n  [1402] Marshall, Review of Reports to Board of Agriculture from\r\n         Southern Departments, 524: 'The management of the land is\r\n         uniform; here and there an exception will be found. The whole\r\n         is convertible, sometimes into arable, and sometimes pasture.\r\n         Arable is sown with wheat, barley, or oats, as long as it\r\n         will bear any; and then grass for eight or ten years, until\r\n         the land is recovered, and capable again of bearing corn.'\r\n         See also p. 531: the lands go back to the waste 'in tenfold\r\n         worse condition than [that wherein] they were in a state of\r\n         nature.' It is just in the country which is not a country of\r\n         village communities that we find this 'aration of the waste.'\r\n\r\n  [1403] Some parts of Worcestershire, for example, show a marked\r\n         deficiency in oxen. On the lands of Osbern Fitz Richard (14\r\n         entries) there are about 102 teams, and there 'could be' 32\r\n         more. See D. B. i. 176 b. In some parts of Cheshire also\r\n         there is a great deficiency.\r\n\r\n  [1404] D. B. i. 122 b: 'Luduham ... Terra 15 car. vel 30 car.' In\r\n         the Exeter book (D. B. iv. 240) two conflicting estimates are\r\n         recorded: 'Luduam ... In ea sunt 3 hidae terrae et reddidit\r\n         gildum pro 1 hida. hanc possunt arare 15 carrucae. hanc tenet\r\n         Ricardus de Comite. in ea sunt 3 hidae terrae et reddidit\r\n         gildum pro 1 hida. hanc possunt arare 30 carrucae. hanc tenet\r\n         Ricardus de Comite.'\r\n\r\n  [1405] D. B. i. 246 b.\r\n\r\n  [1406] Often a Yorkshire entry touching a waste vill gives no _B_.\r\n         Therefore in my Tables I have omitted the number of the\r\n         Yorkshire teamlands, lest hasty inferences should be drawn\r\n         from it. I believe it falls between 5000 and 6000. It is much\r\n         smaller than _A_, much greater than _C_.\r\n\r\n  [1407] Be it remembered that these waste vills can not send\r\n         deputations to meet the justices, and that the\r\n         representatives of the wapentakes may never have seen some of\r\n         those deserts of which they have to speak. 'All of these\r\n         vills,' they say on one occasion (i. 301), 'belong to\r\n         Preston. In sixteen of them there are a few inhabitants; but\r\n         how many we do not know. The rest are waste.'\r\n\r\n  [1408] See below, p. 471.\r\n\r\n  [1409] Devon, 2·1; Cornwall, 2·2; Derby, 3·9; Nottingham, 4·4;\r\n         Lincoln, 5·0. The figure for Stafford is about as low as that\r\n         for Cornwall; but Stafford has been devastated. See Eyton,\r\n         Staffordshire, 30. Kent and Surrey would stand high. Kent\r\n         would perhaps stand as high as Derby. But Lincoln has no\r\n         peer, unless it be Norfolk, Suffolk, or Essex. Our reason for\r\n         not speaking of these last three counties will appear by and\r\n         by.\r\n\r\n  [1410] An essay by Mr W. J. Corbett which I had the advantage of\r\n         seeing some time ago, and which will I hope soon be in print,\r\n         will throw much new light on this matter.\r\n\r\n  [1411] I have roughly added up the carucates and teams of Norfolk, a\r\n         laborious task, and have seen reason to believe that the\r\n         figures for Suffolk would be of the same kind.\r\n\r\n  [1412] In dealing with Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk an equation\r\n         connecting the hide or (as the case may be) carucate with the\r\n         acre becomes of vast importance. I have throughout assumed\r\n         that 120 acres make the hide or carucate. If this assumption,\r\n         about which something will be said hereafter, is unjustified,\r\n         my whole computation breaks down. Then in Norfolk there are\r\n         (especially I think in certain particular hundreds) a good\r\n         many estates for which no extent (real or rateable) is given.\r\n         I have made no allowance for this. On the other hand, I\r\n         believe that I have carried to an extreme in Norfolk the\r\n         principle of including everything. I doubt, for example,\r\n         whether some of the acres held by the parish churches have\r\n         not been reckoned twice over. Also both in Essex and Norfolk\r\n         I reckoned in the lands that are mentioned among the\r\n         _Invasiones_, and in so doing ran the danger of counting them\r\n         for a second time.\r\n\r\n  [1413] Also we may remark that in many respects the survey of Essex\r\n         is closely akin to the survey of East Anglia; but in Essex\r\n         nothing is said about the geldability of vills and therefore,\r\n         unless the Essex hides and acres belong to the order of\r\n         geldable units (_A_), our record tells us nothing as to the\r\n         geld of Essex: an unacceptable conclusion.\r\n\r\n  [1414] Dorset, 15, 23-24.\r\n\r\n  [1415] In Dorset 22,000 acres are 'designedly omitted'; in Somerset\r\n         nearly 178,000; in Staffordshire nearly 246,000. Mr C. S.\r\n         Taylor puts the deficiency in Gloucestershire at 200,000 or\r\n         thereabouts.\r\n\r\n  [1416] See above, p. 370.\r\n\r\n  [1417] D. B. ii. 160 b: A certain vill is 1 league 10 perches long,\r\n         and 1 league 4-1/2 feet wide. Surely such a statement would\r\n         never come from men who could use and were intending to use a\r\n         system of superficial measurement.\r\n\r\n  [1418] D. B. ii. 170. Or take Westbruge (ii. 206): Two carucates;\r\n         two teams and a half; 'this vill is 5 furlongs in length by 3\r\n         in breadth.' If every inch of the vill is ploughed, the\r\n         carucate can only have 75 acres, and each team tills but 60.\r\n         I have noted many cases in which this method will not leave\r\n         120 acres for the team.\r\n\r\n  [1419] D. B. i. 310.\r\n\r\n  [1420] D. B. i. 307 b.\r\n\r\n  [1421] D. B. i. 310. In these Yorkshire cases it is needless for us\r\n         to raise the question whether the _totum_ that is being\r\n         measured is the manor or the vill.\r\n\r\n  [1422] D. B. ii. 118 b.\r\n\r\n  [1423] D. B. i. 303 b (Yorkshire, Oleslec).\r\n\r\n  [1424] D. B. i. 303 b (Othelai).\r\n\r\n  [1425] D. B. i. 346 b (Bastune); 4 carucates for geld; land for 4\r\n         teams; arable land 8 quar. by 8.\r\n\r\n  [1426] D. B. i. 346 b (Langetof); 6 carucates for geld; land for 6\r\n         teams; arable land 15 quar. long and 9 wide.\r\n\r\n  [1427] D. B. i. 248 b (Rolvestune); 2-1/2 hides; land for 8 teams;\r\n         18 teams existing; arable land 2 leagues long and 1 [league]\r\n         wide. Eyton (Staffordshire, 48) has a long note on this entry\r\n         which makes against his doctrine that the teamland is 120\r\n         acres. He suggests that the statement by linear measure is a\r\n         correction of the previous statement that there is land for 8\r\n         teams. Unfortunately, as we have seen, this entry does not\r\n         stand alone. Morgan, op. cit. 34, speaks of some of these\r\n         entries. Those which he mentions and which we have not\r\n         noticed do not seem quite to the point. Thus (D. B. i. 263 b)\r\n         of Edesberie we read 'land for 6 ploughs ... this land is a\r\n         league long and equally wide.' We are not here expressly told\r\n         that all the 'land' thus measured by lineal measure is\r\n         arable. The cases of Dictune, Winetun, Grif and Bernodebi,\r\n         which he then cites, are beside the mark, for what is here\r\n         measured by lineal measure seems to be the whole area of the\r\n         manor.\r\n\r\n  [1428] To make safer, I take the Dorset and Somerset teamlands from\r\n         Eyton, the Gloucester teams from Mr Taylor. In the modern\r\n         statistics the 'arable' covers 'bare fallow' and 'grasses\r\n         under rotation'; the 'permanent pasture' includes 'grass for\r\n         hay,' but excludes 'mountain and heath land used for\r\n         grazing'; the total acreage includes everything but 'tidal\r\n         water.' To bring up the particulars to the total, we should\r\n         have to add (1) a little for orchards and market gardens, and\r\n         having thus obtained the sum of all the land that is within\r\n         the purview of the Board of Agriculture, we should still have\r\n         to add (2) the sites of towns, houses, factories, etc., (3)\r\n         tenements of less than an acre whereof no statistics are\r\n         obtained, (4) roads, railways, etc., (5) waste not used for\r\n         pasture, rocks, sea-shore, etc., (6) non-tidal water. The\r\n         area not accounted for by our figures will be smallest in an\r\n         inland county which has no large towns; it will be raised by\r\n         sea-shore or by manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\n  [1429] Agricultural Returns, 1895, p. xiii: 'The actual loss of\r\n         arable area in the interval covered by the last two decades\r\n         ... is 2,137,000 acres.'\r\n\r\n  [1430] Mr Seebohm, Village Community, p. 103, seems to think that D.\r\n         B. testifies to no more than 5 million acres of arable. But,\r\n         even if we stop at the Humber, we shall have 9 million if a\r\n         team tills 120.\r\n\r\n  [1431] D. B. ii. 116: T. R. E. there were 1320 _burgenses_.\r\n\r\n  [1432] D. B. ii 372.\r\n\r\n  [1433] It seems probable that in many cases the parish priest is\r\n         reckoned among the townsmen, the _villani_.\r\n\r\n  [1434] See above, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  [1435] While historical economists can still dispute as to whether\r\n         the population in 1346 was 5 millions, or only 2-1/2\r\n         (Cunningham, Eng. Industry, i. 301) guesses about 1085 are\r\n         premature. M. Fabre has lately estimated the population of\r\n         England under Henry II. at 2,880,000. But as to this\r\n         calculation, see Liebermann, Eng. Hist. Rev. xi. 746.\r\n\r\n  [1436] See above, p. 366.\r\n\r\n  [1437] Walter of Henley, pp. 67, 71.\r\n\r\n  [1438] Walter of Henley, p. 19.\r\n\r\n  [1439] Rogers, Hist. Agric. i. 50-1.\r\n\r\n  [1440] Tour in the Southern Counties, ed. 3 (1767), p. 158. See also\r\n         p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [1441] Agricultural Returns, 1895, p. 239. The figures given under\r\n         the year 1894 which express the average yield of a statute\r\n         acre in imperial bushels are for Australasia, 8·18; India,\r\n         9·00; Russia in Europe, 10·76; United States, 12·79.\r\n         Apparently in South Australia 1,577,000 acres can produce as\r\n         little as 7,781,000 bushels. As I understand, Sir J. B. Lawes\r\n         and Sir J. H. Gilbert reckon that for an unmanured acre in\r\n         England 16 bushels would be an average return, but that if\r\n         the same acre is continuously sown with wheat, the yield will\r\n         decline at the rate of nearly a quarter of a bushel every\r\n         year. See Journ. Agricult. Soc., 3rd Ser. vol. iv. p. 87.\r\n\r\n  [1442] This calculus was officially adopted in 1891; see a paper by\r\n         Sir J. B. Lawes and Sir J. H. Gilbert in Journ. Agric. Soc.,\r\n         3rd Ser., vol iv. p. 102. I desire to express my thanks to\r\n         the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture for directing my\r\n         attention to this paper.\r\n\r\n  [1443] I understand that the average number of loaves that can be\r\n         made from 280 lbs. of flour may be put at about 90.\r\n\r\n  [1444] Agricultural Returns, 1895, pp. 166, 90, 198. The old rough\r\n         estimate of a quarter of wheat per head is much too high; the\r\n         average is about 5·65 bushels. See the paper cited in note\r\n         1442. Now-a-days we can further allot to each inhabitant of\r\n         the United Kingdom an amount of cereal matter other than\r\n         wheat, to wit, barley, oats, beans, peas, maize, etc. which\r\n         would take for its production perhaps as much as 1·5 times\r\n         the area of the land that is required for the growth of the\r\n         wheat that we have allotted to him. But much of this only\r\n         feeds him by feeding animals that he eats; much only feeds\r\n         him very indirectly by feeding horses engaged in the\r\n         production or transport of food; and some of it can not be\r\n         said to feed him at all. Then, on the other hand, large\r\n         quantities of potatoes, sugar and rice are being eaten.\r\n\r\n  [1445] Wheat, oats, barley and peas are mentioned in D. B.; also rye\r\n         (i. 257 b).\r\n\r\n  [1446] Hale, Worcester Register, p. civ.\r\n\r\n  [1447] Boldon Book, D. B. iv. 580-5. So in D. B. i. 69 the sheriff\r\n         of Wiltshire receives equal quantities of wheat and malt and\r\n         a larger quantity of oats. See also D. B. i. 179 b.\r\n\r\n  [1448] Domesday of St. Paul's, 164*. See also Cart. Rams. iii. 231.\r\n\r\n  [1449] Ibid, cxxxiv. 173.\r\n\r\n  [1450] Ibid. 173.\r\n\r\n  [1451] Calculations are difficult and may be misleading, not only\r\n         because of the variability of medieval measures, but also\r\n         because of the varying strength of beer. Mr Steele, the Chief\r\n         Inspector of Excise, has been good enough to inform me that a\r\n         bushel of unmalted barley weighing 42 lbs. would yield about\r\n         19·5 gallons of beer at 58°. The figures from St. Paul's seem\r\n         to point to a strong brew, since they apparently derive but 8\r\n         gallons from the bushel of mixed grain. The ordinances of\r\n         cent. xiii. (Statutes, i. 200, 202) seem to suppose that,\r\n         outside the cities, the brewer, after deducting expenses and\r\n         profit, could sell 8 to 12 gallons of beer for the price of a\r\n         bushel of barley. If we suppose that the bushel of barley\r\n         gives 18 gallons, the man who drinks his gallon a day\r\n         consumes 20 bushels a year, and when the acre yields but 6\r\n         bushels of wheat, it will hardly yield more than 7 of barley.\r\n         There is valuable learning in J. Bickerdyke, The Curiosities\r\n         of Ale, pp. 54, 106, 154.\r\n\r\n  [1452] As to both meat and drink see Ine 70, § 1; T. 460, 468, 471,\r\n         473, 474; E. 118; Æthelstan, II. 1. § 1; D. B. i. 169, rents\r\n         of the shrievalty of Wiltshire. Attempts to measure the flood\r\n         of beer break down before the uncertain content of the\r\n         _amber_, _modius_, _sextarius_, etc. In particular I can not\r\n         believe that the amber of ale contained (Schmid, p. 530;\r\n         Robertson, Hist. Essays, 68) 4 of our bushels; but, do all we\r\n         can to reduce it, the allowance of beer seems large.\r\n\r\n  [1453] D. B. ii. 162 b: Cheltenham and King's Barton.\r\n\r\n  [1454] D. B. i. 205. The abbot of Peterborough is bound to find\r\n         pasture for 120 pigs for the abbot of Thorney. If he can not\r\n         do this, he must feed and fatten 60 pigs with corn (_de\r\n         annona pascit et impinguat 60 porcos_).\r\n\r\n  [1455] Walter of Henley, 13. Every week each ox is to have 3-1/2\r\n         garbs of oats, and 10 garbs would yield a bushel.\r\n\r\n  [1456] Now-a-days the average acre in England will produce about 29\r\n         bushels of wheat or 40 of oats. Agricultural Returns, 1895,\r\n         pp. 66, 70.\r\n\r\n  [1457] See above, p. 398.\r\n\r\n  [1458] Rogers, op. cit. i. 51.\r\n\r\n  [1459] Clearly so in some cases. See e. g. the first entry in Inq.\r\n         Com. Cant. The teams of lord and villeins having been\r\n         mentioned, we then read that the 'pecunia _in dominio_'\r\n         consists of so many pigs, sheep, etc. Moreover, if all the\r\n         cattle not of the plough were enumerated under the title\r\n         _animalia_, there would not be nearly enough to renew the\r\n         number of beasts of the plough. Again, when the capacity of\r\n         the wood is stated in terms of the pigs that it will\r\n         maintain, the number thus given will in general vastly exceed\r\n         the number of pigs whose existence is recorded. Lastly, we\r\n         see that at Crediton (iv. 107) where the lord has but 57\r\n         pigs, he receives every year 150 pigs from certain\r\n         _porcarii_, whose herds are not counted. Throughout Sussex\r\n         the lord takes one pig from every villein who has seven (i.\r\n         16 b). See also Morgan, op. cit. 56.\r\n\r\n  [1460] See above, p. 76.\r\n\r\n  [1461] Before we have gone through a tenth of the account of Essex,\r\n         we have read of 'wood for' near 10,000 pigs. If the woods\r\n         were full and this rate were maintained throughout the\r\n         country, the swine of England would be as numerous T. R. W.\r\n         as they now are. No doubt Essex was exceptionally wooded and\r\n         many woods were understocked; still this mode of reckoning\r\n         the capacity of wood-land would only occur to men who were\r\n         accustomed to see large herds.\r\n\r\n  [1462] In the thirteenth century it is common to find that the acre\r\n         of meadow is deemed to be twice or three times as valuable as\r\n         the best arable acre of the same village, and a much higher\r\n         ratio is sometimes found.\r\n\r\n  [1463] This appears from the parallel account of Westley given in D.\r\n         B. and Inq. Com. Cant. (p. 19) where 'pratum 2 bobus' = '2\r\n         ac. prati.' Entries such as the following are not uncommon\r\n         (I. C. C. p. 13): 'Terra est 4 car.; in dominio est una et\r\n         villani habent 3 car. Pratum 1 car.' See Morgan, op. cit.\r\n         53-5.\r\n\r\n  [1464] Eyton, Dorset, 146.\r\n\r\n  [1465] In the above table all _vaccae_, _animalia_ and _animalia\r\n         ociosa_ are reckoned in the third column. I believe that the\r\n         two last of these terms cover all beasts of the bovine race\r\n         that are not beasts of the plough. The horses are mostly\r\n         _runcini_ and are kept for agricultural purposes. It may be\r\n         doubted whether destriers and palfreys are enumerated.\r\n\r\n  [1466] Rot. Hund. ii. 570, 575. The calculation which gave these\r\n         results was laborious; but I believe that they are pretty\r\n         correct.\r\n\r\n  [1467] On the whole, the _valet_ of D. B., so far as it is precise,\r\n         seems to me an answer to the question, What rent would a\r\n         _firmarius_ pay for this estate stocked as it is? But there\r\n         are many difficulties.\r\n\r\n  [1468] See the important but difficult account of the mill at\r\n         Arundel: D. B. i. 23.\r\n\r\n  [1469] Hall, Court Life, 221-3. The Glastonbury Inquests (Roxburgh\r\n         Club) show that 36_d._ is the settled price for the ox.\r\n\r\n  [1470] Rogers, Hist. Agric. i. 226, 342.\r\n\r\n  [1471] See above, p. 382.\r\n\r\n  [1472] Inq. Com. Cant. 38.\r\n\r\n  [1473] Or a little less.\r\n\r\n  [1474] Perhaps too small.

The\r\n         hides of London and other boroughs would raise the total.\r\n         Pearson, History, i. 658, guessed 90,000 to 100,000.\r\n\r\n  [1479] Above, p. 3.\r\n\r\n  [1480] As to the _magnum pondus Normannorum_, see Crawford Charters,\r\n         78.\r\n\r\n  [1481] D.

See Round in Domesday Studies,\r\n         ii. 545.\r\n\r\n  [1501] Perhaps add 5 hides at Suchelei; but apparently these have\r\n         been already included in the account of the King's Land.\r\n\r\n  [1502] A large hundred called Halfshire Hundred was formed. In Latin\r\n         records it is _Hundredum Dimidii Comitatus_. For some light\r\n         on the constitution of Dodingtree, see Round, Feudal England,\r\n         61.\r\n\r\n  [1503] 'In Huntedunescyre sunt dccc hide et dimid.' This means eight\r\n         and a half hundreds.\r\n\r\n  [1504] Leges Anglorum, p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [1505] On a re-count I made 1185.\r\n\r\n  [1506] Mr Charles Taylor gives 2595. See above, p. 412. Therefore I\r\n         have once more gone through the county with his book before\r\n         me. The difference between us is not altogether due to my\r\n         faulty arithmetic; but arises from the different\r\n         constructions that we put upon a few composite entries. In\r\n         particular I can not allow the bishop of Worcester anything\r\n         like the 231 hides that Mr Taylor gives him. When I find an\r\n         entry in this form: 'Sancta Maria tenet H. Ibi sunt _x_ hidae\r\n         ... De hac terra huius manerii Turstinus tenet _y_ hidas in\r\n         O,' I believe that _x_ includes _y_, and this no matter how\r\n         far the place called O may be from the place called H. My\r\n         2388 is I think a trifle too low; but I believe the number\r\n         lies very close to 2400 on one side or the other.\r\n\r\n  [1507] Ellis, Introduction, i. 184.\r\n\r\n  [1508] Feudal England, 148.\r\n\r\n  [1509] After a re-count I think that my 1356 is a little too large,\r\n         and should not be surprised if the 2663-1/2 had been exactly\r\n         halved.\r\n\r\n  [1510] See above, p. 451. This is but one instance. Several other\r\n         hundreds had been similarly relieved. See Round, Feudal\r\n         England, 51.\r\n\r\n  [1511] My 500 (or a trifle more) for Cheshire does not include the\r\n         land between the Ribble and the Mersey. The figures given for\r\n         that district are, as is well known, very difficult. If we\r\n         take the final statement (D. B. i. 270) about the 79 'hides'\r\n         as a grand total and hold that each of these contains 6\r\n         carucates (Feudal England, 86) and that each of these\r\n         carucates pays geld equivalent to that of one ordinary hide,\r\n         then we have here 474 units to be added to the Cestrian 500,\r\n         and yet more northerly lands may have been gelding along with\r\n         Chester in Cnut's day.\r\n\r\n  [1512] The various copies disagree as to whether Herefordshire shall\r\n         have 1200 or 1500 hides. My figure stands about halfway\r\n         between these two; but many hides were not gelding in 1086. I\r\n         can not bring the Warwickshire hides down to 1200.\r\n\r\n  [1513] I take the numbers of the hundreds from Dr Stubbs, Const.\r\n         Hist. 106. I take them thence in order that I may not be\r\n         tempted to make them rounder than they are.\r\n\r\n  [1514] See above, p. 457.\r\n\r\n  [1515] Mr C. S. Taylor, op. cit. 31, finds 41.\r\n\r\n  [1516] Round, Feudal England, 44 ff.\r\n\r\n  [1517] Both statements might be illustrated from the Dorsetshire\r\n         accounts. Between 2 and 8 Hen. II. the geld seems to rise\r\n         from £228. 5_s._ to £248. 5_s._ but there is a blunder in the\r\n         addition of the pardons in the latter roll. I believe that Mr\r\n         Round has already mentioned this case somewhere. The\r\n         correspondence between the Pipe Rolls and Domesday is\r\n         sufficiently close to warrant our saying that the story told\r\n         by Orderic of a new and severer valuation made by Rufus can\r\n         have but little, if any, truth behind it. See Stubbs, Const.\r\n         Hist. i. 327.\r\n\r\n  [1518] The common formula is: 'T. R. E. geldabat pro _a_ hidis; ibi\r\n         tamen sunt _a´_ hidae' and _a´_ is largely greater than _a_.\r\n         I infer that _a´_ represents a new and increased assessment,\r\n         for the Geld Inquest seems to show Cornwall paying for 401\r\n         hides and a fraction while I make _a´_=399.\r\n\r\n  [1519] For these three counties we can not give any _B_, but must\r\n         draw inferences from _C_. Clearly in Hereford _C_ was often\r\n         thought to be much less than _B_.\r\n\r\n  [1520] As already said (above, p. 420) what we take to be\r\n         Leicester's equivalent for _B_ is sometimes given by an\r\n         unusual formula.\r\n\r\n  [1521] Rogers, Hist. Agricult. i. 110.\r\n\r\n  [1522] Yorkshire Lay Subsidy (Yorksh. Archæol. Soc.) p. xxxii.\r\n\r\n  [1523] Total acreage under all kinds of crops, bare fallow and\r\n         grass, excluding (1) nursery gardens, (2) woods and\r\n         plantations, (3) mountain and heath land.\r\n\r\n  [1524] Powell, East Anglia Rising, 121-3.\r\n\r\n  [1525] As we are giving or trying to give the fullest number of\r\n         hides whose existence is attested by D. B., and not the\r\n         number gelding in 1086, we compare with it the values given\r\n         by Pearson (Hist. Engl. i. 665) for the T. R. E. His values\r\n         for the T. R. W. are given above, p. 401.\r\n\r\n  [1526] Suffolk and Norfolk are omitted because the relation between\r\n         their carucates and the villar geld pence is as yet\r\n         uncertain. Stafford does not provide _valuits_ enough to give\r\n         a stable average; but in general the _valets_ and _valuits_\r\n         for its hides are high. I have excluded (1) royal demesne,\r\n         (2) cases in which there is any talk of 'waste,' (3) cases in\r\n         which a particular manor is obviously privileged. In\r\n         Lincolnshire it is difficult to obtain good figures, because\r\n         of the way in which the sokes are valued.\r\n\r\n  [1527] See above, p. 386, note 1304.\r\n\r\n  [1528] Werhard's testament, K. 230 (i. 297), tells us of a great\r\n         estate of 100 hides at Otford, of 30 hides at Graveney and so\r\n         forth. The figures are so little in harmony with D. B. and\r\n         with the other Canterbury charters that we may suspect the\r\n         100 manses at Otford of covering many smaller estates, each\r\n         of which appears elsewhere with a name of its own.\r\n\r\n  [1529] In D. B. i. 12 b St. Augustin holds 30 solins at Norborne. In\r\n         618 Eadbald of Kent, K. 6 (i. 9), gave 30 _aratra_ at\r\n         Nortburne; but the deed is spurious. In D. B. 5 b, Rochester\r\n         has 3 solins at Totesclive, 6 at Hallinges, 2-1/2 at\r\n         Coclestane, 3 at Mellingetes, 6 at Bronlei. In 788 Offa, K.\r\n         152 (i. 183), gave 6 _aratra_ at Trottesclib. Egbert, K. 160\r\n         (i. 193), gave 10 at Hallingas. In 880 Æthelstan, K. 312 (ii.\r\n         109), B. ii. 168, gave 3 at Cucolanstan. Edmund, K. 409 (ii.\r\n         265), gave 3 at Meallingas. In 998 Æthelred, K. 700 (iii.\r\n         305), gave 6 at Brunleage. The Rochester deeds therefore may\r\n         point to some reduction; but they do not tell of any\r\n         startling change.\r\n\r\n  [1530] Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 101, holds that the Euti who invaded\r\n         Kent fitted themselves into an agrarian framework prepared by\r\n         Celts. They came not, like the great mass of Saxons and\r\n         Angles, from a country in which villages of the Germanic type\r\n         had grown up, but from an originally Celtic land, which they\r\n         while still in the pastoral state had seized and subjugated.\r\n         It is an interesting though hazardous speculation. Certainly\r\n         some cause or another keeps Kent apart from the rest of\r\n         England.\r\n\r\n  [1531] Thus, K. 371 (ii. 207): Æthelstan gives to the church of\r\n         Exeter 6 _perticae_ (yard-lands?). B. ii. 433: he gives one\r\n         cassate to St Petroc. K. 787 (iv. 115): the Confessor gives a\r\n         _pertica_ and a half in Cornwall. Crawford Charters, pp.\r\n         1-43: Æthelheard gives 20 cassates at Crediton; that is, a\r\n         dozen of our parishes. Ibid. p. 9: a single yard of land is\r\n         gaged for 30 mancuses of gold. K. 1306 (vi. 163): in 739\r\n         Æthelred gives 3 _perticae_ to Athelney. K. 1324 (vi. 188):\r\n         Cnut gives to Athelney _duas mansas siue (= et) unam\r\n         perticam_.\r\n\r\n  [1532] K. 1143 (v. 278); B. ii. 527. For the _arepennis_ see\r\n         Meitzen, op. cit. i. 278, where an explanation derived from\r\n         the Irish laws is given of its name.\r\n\r\n  [1533] See above, p. 451.\r\n\r\n  [1534] The lords of Cambridgeshire may have done good service during\r\n         the campaign in the Isle of Ely.\r\n\r\n  [1535] Pearson's _valuit_ is £491; his _valet_ £736.\r\n\r\n  [1536] The appearance of the curious _hida_ may lead to the guess\r\n         that if the geld be at two shillings, it is the\r\n         Leicestershire _hida_, not the Leicestershire _carucata_\r\n         which pays this sum. But (1) if the _hida_ contains 18, or\r\n         even 12, carucates we shall then have on our hands a case of\r\n         extreme under-taxation; and (2) this will not account for the\r\n         fact that an exceedingly small value is given to the land\r\n         that a team ploughs.\r\n\r\n  [1537] D. B. i. 233.\r\n\r\n  [1538] At the end of the account of the land between Ribble and\r\n         Mersey (i. 240) we are told that there were altogether 79\r\n         _hidae_ which T. R. E. were worth £145. 2_s._ 2_d._ This\r\n         would give a very small value for the carucate, if the _hida_\r\n         of this district had six carucates; and in many cases 2_s._\r\n         8_d._ is the value assigned to the carucate. If to a\r\n         two-shilling geld the _hida_ paid but two shillings, this is\r\n         a bad, though not unprecedented, case of under-taxation. On\r\n         the other hand, if the carucate paid two shillings, its value\r\n         has been stated in some abnormal fashion. I do not think it\r\n         out of the question that the _hidae_ of Leicestershire and\r\n         Lancashire are modern arrangements designed to give relief in\r\n         some manner or another to districts which have been too\r\n         heavily burdened with carucates.\r\n\r\n  [1539] It may, however, have been applied to the conquered West\r\n         Wales from an early time. See above, p. 467.\r\n\r\n  [1540] See above, p. 427.\r\n\r\n  [1541] D. B. i. 293 b.\r\n\r\n  [1542] And two sokemen with two teams.\r\n\r\n  [1543] The artificiality or traditionality of the teamland is even\r\n         more obvious in D. B. than it is in our statement. At Okeham\r\n         are 4 hides; land for 16 teams. The men have 37. The king has\r\n         2 in his demesne 'et tamen aliae quatuor possunt esse.' So\r\n         what is land for 16 teams is not only stocked but\r\n         insufficiently stocked with 39. The manor of one carucate\r\n         held by Leuenot seems to be another infringement of the\r\n         traditional scheme, unless that carucate has been already\r\n         reckoned among the four at Okeham.\r\n\r\n  [1544] Many other instances suggesting the artificiality of _B_\r\n         might be given from northern counties; e.g. in Northampton\r\n         (i. 227) we have five consecutive entries in which _A_ = 2,\r\n         2, 2, 0·5, 4; _B_ = 5, 5, 5, 1·25, 10; _C_ = 3, 2, 5, 1, 8.\r\n         See also Round, Feudal England, 90.\r\n\r\n  [1545] D.

It will be remembered that,\r\n         as our hundred-weight (112 lbs) shows, 112 can be called a\r\n         hundred.\r\n\r\n  [1547] Pipe Rolls, 2. 3. 4. 5. Hen. II. In a few cases the earlier\r\n         _donum_ includes a composition 'for murders and pleas.'

Three-quarters of a hide appears\r\n         sometimes as 'half a hide and 30 A.,' sometimes as 'a hide\r\n         less 30 A.' We might add to our other arguments derived from\r\n         Essex that used by Morgan (op. cit., p. 31). It seems fairly\r\n         clear that the holding of Roger 'God Bless the Dames', which\r\n         is called 3 V. in one place is called 1/2 H. + 30 A. in\r\n         another place (D.

B. of a few 'hides' which apparently\r\n         consist altogether of wood-land (e.g. ii. 55 b) is one of the\r\n         many signs that the fiscal hide has diverged from its\r\n         original pattern. A block of wood-land would not be 'the land\r\n         of one family.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Beyond Domesday._\r\n\r\n\r\n[The hide beyond Domesday.]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen a good deal of evidence which tends to prove that the\r\nhide has had for its model a tenement comprising 120 acres of arable\r\nland or thereabouts. Some slight evidence of this we have seen on the\r\nface of the Anglo-Saxon land-books[1616]. A little more evidence\r\npointing in the same direction we have seen in the manorial extents of a\r\nlater day[1617]. And now we have argued that the fiscal hide of the\r\nConqueror's day is composed of 120 (fiscal) acres. From all this we are\r\ninclined to infer that the hide has, if we may so speak, started by\r\nbeing a tenement which, if it attained its ideal, would comprise a\r\nlong-hundred of arable acre-strips, and thence to infer that in the very\r\nold days of conquest and settlement the free family or the free\r\nhouse-father commonly and normally possessed a tenement of this large\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nWe have now to confess that this theory is open to attack, and must\r\nendeavour to defend it, or rather to explain why we think that, when all\r\nobjections have been weighed, the balance of probability still inclines\r\nin its favour.\r\n\r\n[Arguments in favour of the small hide.]\r\n\r\nThat all along from Bede's day downwards Englishmen have had in their\r\nminds a typical tenement and have been making this idea the framework of\r\ntheir scheme of government can not be doubted. Nor can we doubt that\r\nthis idea has had some foundation in fact. It could not occur to any one\r\nexcept in a country where a large and preponderant number of tenements\r\nreally, if roughly, conformed to a single type. Therefore the contest\r\nmust be, and indeed has been, between the champions of different typical\r\ntenements, and in the main there are but two theories in the field. The\r\none would give the Anglo-Saxon hide its long-hundred of acres, the other\r\nwould concede to it but some thirty or forty, and would in effect equate\r\nit with the virgate rather than with the hide of later days[1618].\r\nPerhaps we may briefly state the arguments which have been urged in\r\nfavour of this small hide by saying that small hides are requisite (1)\r\nif we are to find room enough within the appropriate areal boundaries\r\nfor the hides that are distributed by Domesday Book and the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncharters, (2) if we are to explain the large quantities of hides or\r\nfamily-lands which are assigned to divers districts by Bede and by that\r\nancient document which we call The Tribal Hidage, (3) if we are to bring\r\nour own typical tenement into line with the typical tenement of Germany,\r\n(4) if we are not to overdo our family or house-father with arable acres\r\nand bushels of corn.\r\n\r\n[Continuity in the hide of the land-books.]\r\n\r\nA 'name-shifting' must be postulated. Somehow or another, what was the\r\nhide becomes the virgate, while the name 'hide' is transferred to a much\r\nlarger unit. Now in such a name-shifting there is nothing that is very\r\nimprobable, if we approach the matter _a priori_. Thought has been poor\r\nand language has been poor. The term 'yard of land' may, as we have\r\nseen[1619], stand for a quarter-acre or for a much larger space. But\r\nthis particular name-shifting seems to us improbable in a high degree.\r\nFor when did it happen? Surely it did not happen after the Norman\r\nConquest. We have from Edward the Confessor quite enough documents to\r\nwarrant our saying with certainty that the hides and manses of his\r\ncharters are the hides of Domesday Book. Suppose for a moment that all\r\nthese parchments were forged after the Conquest, this would only\r\nstrengthen our case, for stupid indeed must the forger have been who\r\ndid not remember that if he was to make a title-deed for the abbey's\r\nlands he must multiply the hides by four or thereabouts. This argument\r\nwill carry us far. We trace the stream of land-books back from Edward to\r\nCnut, to Æthelred, to Edgar, to Offa, nay, to the very days of Bede;\r\nnowhere can we see any such breach of continuity as that which would\r\nappear had the hypothetical name-shifting taken place. The forgers know\r\nnothing of it. Boldly they make the first Christian kings bestow upon\r\nthe church just about the number of manses that the church has in the\r\neleventh century if the manse be Domesday's hide.\r\n\r\n[Examples from charters of Chertsey.]\r\n\r\nBoth points might be illustrated by the Chertsey charters. In Domesday\r\nBook St. Peter of Chertsey is credited with many hides in divers parts\r\nof Surrey[1620]. A charter is forthcoming whereby Edward the Confessor\r\nconfirms the abbey's possession of these estates[1621], and in the main\r\nthe number of 'manses' that this charter locates in any village is the\r\nnumber of 'hides' that the abbey will have there in the year 1086. The\r\ntwo lists are not and ought not to be identical, for there have been\r\nrearrangements; but obviously the manse of the one is the hide of the\r\nother. Then the monks have books which profess to come from the seventh\r\ncentury[1622] and to show how Frithwald the kingling of Surrey endowed\r\ntheir monastery. These books may be forgeries; but the scale on which\r\nthey are forged is the scale of the Confessor's charter and of Domesday\r\nBook. It has been thought that they are as old as Edgar's day[1623]; but\r\nat any rate their makers did not suppose that in order to tell a\r\nprofitable story they must portray Frithwald bestowing four manses for\r\nevery hide that the abbey possessed.\r\n\r\n[Examples from charters of Malmesbury.]\r\n\r\nOr look we at the estates of St. Aldhelm. The monks of Malmesbury have\r\na book from the Confessor[1624] which agrees very accurately, perhaps\r\ntoo accurately, with the Domesday record[1625]. The latter ascribes to\r\ntheir house (among other lands) 10 hides at Dauntsey, 5 at Somerford, 5\r\nat Norton, 30 at Kemble 35 at Purton. The Confessor has confirmed to\r\nthem (among other lands) 10 'hides' at Dauntsey given by Æthelwulf, 5 at\r\nSomerford and 5 at Norton given by Æthelstan, 30 at Kemble and 35 at\r\nPurton given by Ceadwealla. Then behind this book are older books. Here\r\nis one dated in 931 by which Æthelstan gives _quinque mansas_ at\r\nSomerford and _quinque mansas_ at Norton[1626]. Here is another dated in\r\n850 by which Æthelwulf gives _decem mansiones_ at Dauntsey[1627]. Here\r\nis a third by which in 796 Egfrith restores that _terram xxxv manentium_\r\nat Purton[1628]. Here from 682, from the days of Aldhelm himself, is a\r\ndeed of Ceadwealla bestowing _xxxii cassatos_ at Kemble[1629]. It is\r\npretty; it is much too pretty; but it is good proof that the Malmesbury\r\nmonks know nothing of any change in the conveyancer's unit[1630].\r\n\r\n[Permanence of the hidation.]\r\n\r\nIf we examine any reputable set of land-books, those of Worcester, for\r\nexample, or those of Abingdon and try to trace the history of those very\r\nhides the existence of which is chronicled by Domesday Book, we shall\r\noften fail. This was to be expected. Any one who has 'read with a\r\nconveyancer' will know that many difficulties are apt to arise when an\r\nattempt is made to identify the piece of land described in one with that\r\ndescribed in another and much older document. In the days before the\r\nConquest many causes were perplexing our task. We have spoken of them\r\nbefore, but will recall them to memory. New assessments were sometimes\r\nmade, and thenceforth an estate which had formerly contained five hides\r\nmight be spoken of as having only four. New villages were formed, and\r\nthe hides which had been attributed to one place would thenceforth be\r\nattributed to another. Great landlords enjoyed a large power of\r\nrearranging their lands, not only for the purposes of their own economy,\r\nbut also for the purposes of public finance. In some cases they had\r\ncollected their estates into a few gigantic _maneria_ each of which\r\nwould pay a single round sum to the king[1631]. Lastly, the kings gave\r\nand the kings took away. The disendowment of churches and simple\r\nspoliation were not unknown; exchanges were frequent; no series of\r\nland-books is complete. But when some allowance has been made for the\r\neffects of these causes, we shall see plainly that, if the charters are\r\nto account for the facts displayed by Domesday Book, then the manses of\r\nthe charters, even of the earliest charters, can not have been of much\r\nless extent than the hides of the Norman record. We know of no case in\r\nwhich a church, whatever its wealth of genuine and spurious parchments,\r\ncould make a title to many more manses than the hides that it had in\r\n1086[1632].\r\n\r\n[Gifts of villages.]\r\n\r\nAnother test of continuity may be applied. In the Conqueror's day a\r\nvillage in the south of England will very commonly be rated at five or\r\nsome low multiple of five hides, ten, fifteen or twenty[1633]. Now we\r\nhave argued above that the land-book of an Anglo-Saxon king generally,\r\nthough not always, disposes of an integral village or several integral\r\nvillages, and if we look at the land-books we shall commonly see that\r\nthe manses or hides which they describe as being at a single place are\r\nin number five or some low multiple of five. We open the second volume\r\nof the Codex Diplomaticus and analyze the first hundred instances of\r\nroyal gifts which do not bear a condemnatory asterisk and which are not\r\ngifts of small plots in or about the towns of Canterbury and Rochester.\r\nIn date these land-books range from A.D. 840 to A.D. 956. In sixty out\r\nof a hundred cases the number of manses is 5 or a multiple of 5. In\r\neighteen it is 5; in sixteen 10; in six 15; in thirteen 20; in three 25;\r\nin one 30; in one 80; in two 100. There are a few small gifts; one of a\r\nyokelet; six of 1 manse; four of 2 manses; five of 3. The great bulk of\r\nthe gifts range from 5 to 25 manses. Only four out of 100 exceed 25; of\r\nthese four, one is of 30, another of 80, while two are of 100. At this\r\nrate of progress and if the manse had no more than some 30 acres, we\r\nshall have extreme difficulty in accounting for the large territories\r\nwhich on the eve of the Conquest were held by the churches of Wessex,\r\nand by those very churches which have left us cartularies that are only\r\ntoo ample. This is not all. If these manses were but yard-lands, then,\r\nunless we suppose that the average village was a tiny cluster, it is\r\nplain enough that the kings did not usually give away integral villages,\r\nand yet a church's lordship of integral villages and even of divers\r\ncontiguous villages is one of the surest and most impressive traits that\r\nthe Conqueror's record reveals.\r\n\r\n[Gifts of manses in villages.]\r\n\r\nParenthetically we may admit that the king is not always giving away a\r\nwhole village. Nasse has contended that when a land-book professes to\r\ndispose of a certain number (_x_) of manses at the place called _X_, and\r\nthen sets forth the boundaries of _X_, we must not infer that the whole\r\nof the land that lies within those boundaries is comprised in the\r\ngrant[1634]. The proof of this consists of a few instances in which, to\r\nall appearance, two different tracts of land are conveyed by two\r\ndifferent books and yet the boundaries stated in those two books are the\r\nsame. We will allege one instance additional to those that have been\r\nmentioned by others. In 969 Bishop Oswald of Worcester gave to his man\r\nÆthelweard seven manses, whereof five lay in the place called Tedington.\r\nThe book which effected this conveyance states the bounds of\r\nTedington[1635]. In 977 the same bishop gave to his man Eadric three\r\nmanses at Tedington by a book which describes the boundaries of that\r\nplace in just the same manner as that in which they were set forth by\r\nthe earlier charter[1636]. Some care, however, should be taken before we\r\nassume that the two deeds which deal with land at _X_ dispose of\r\ndifferent tracts; for book-land had a way of returning to the king who\r\ngave it; also the gift of one king was sometimes confirmed by another;\r\nand even if the one book purports to convey _x_ and the other _y_\r\nmanses, we must call to mind the possibility that there has been a\r\nreassessment or a clerical error. Still it seems to be fairly well\r\nproved that there are cases in which the _x_ manses which the donor\r\ngives are but some of the manses that lie within the meres drawn by his\r\ndeed of gift. This certainly deserves remark. At first sight nothing\r\ncould look more foolish than that we should painfully define the limits\r\nof the village territory and yet leave undefined the limits of that part\r\nof the village territory which we are giving away. But this practice is\r\nexplicable if we remember the nature of a manse in a village. It\r\nconsists of many scattered strips of arable land and of rights over\r\nuncultivated waste. To define the limits of the whole territory is\r\nimportant, for the donee should know how far his cattle can wander\r\nwithout trespass. To specify each acre-strip would, on the other hand,\r\nbe a tedious task and would serve no profitable end. However, there can\r\nbe little doubt that very generally what a charter bestows is the whole\r\nof the land of which the boundaries are described, and therefore the\r\nwhole territory of a village or of several neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\n[The largest gifts.]\r\n\r\nBut at the moment the charters which will be the most instructive will\r\nbe those which attribute to a single place some large number of hides.\r\nIn these the champions of a small hide have found their stronghold. They\r\nsee perhaps 100 hides ascribed to the place called _X_; they look for\r\nthat place in modern maps and gazetteers and then tell us that in order\r\nto pack our 100 hides within the parochial boundary we must reduce the\r\nsize of the hide to 30 acres at the most.\r\n\r\n[The Winchester estate at at Chilcombe.]\r\n\r\nThe dangers that beset this process may be well illustrated by the\r\ndocuments relating to one of the most interesting estates in all\r\nEngland, the great Chilcombe estate of the church of Winchester, which\r\nstretched for many a mile from the gates of the royal city of the West\r\nSaxon kings. Let us follow the story as the monks told it in a series of\r\ncharters, few of which have escaped Kemble's asterisk. In the first days\r\nof English Christianity, Cynegils, king of the West Saxons, gave the\r\nChilcombe valley to St. Birinus. King after king confirmed the gift,\r\nbut it was never put into writing until the days of Æthelwulf. He\r\ndeclared by charter that this land should defend itself for one hide.\r\nThis was part of that great tithing operation which puzzles the modern\r\nhistorian[1637]. In 908 Edward the Elder confirmed this act by a charter\r\nin which he declared that the land at Chilcombe (including that at\r\nNursling and Chilbolton) contained 100 manses, but that the whole was\r\nto be reckoned as a single manse. He also remarked that the land\r\nincluded many _villae_[1638]. The next book comes from Æthelstan; the\r\nwhole valley (_vallis illuster Ciltecumb appellata_) with all its\r\nappendages was to owe the service of a single manse[1639]. Two charters\r\nwere obtained from Edgar. However much land there might be at Chilcombe,\r\nit was to defend itself for one hide[1640]. A writ of similar import,\r\nwhich Kemble has accepted, was issued by Æthelred the Unready[1641]. It\r\nsaid that there were a hundred hides at Chilcombe and proceeded to allot\r\nthem thus:--\r\n\r\n  Æstun                      4     Easton\r\n  Afintun and Ufintun        5     Avington and Ovington\r\n  Ticceburn                 25     Titchbourne\r\n  Cymestun                   5     Kilmiston\r\n  Stoke                      5     Bishopstoke\r\n  Brombrygce and Oterburn    5     Brambridge and Otterbourne\r\n  Twyfyrde                  20     Twyford\r\n  Ceolbandingtun            20     Chilbolton\r\n  Hnutscilling               5     Nursling\r\n\r\nThis territory extends along the left-hand bank of the Itchen from\r\nKilmiston to Titchbourne, thence past Ovington, Avington, Easton,\r\nChilcombe, and Winchester itself, Twyford, Brambridge, Otterbourne to\r\nBishopstoke. If we journeyed by straight lines from village to village\r\nwe should find that our course was a long twenty miles. Then, to\r\ncomplete the 100 hides, Nursling which is near Southampton and\r\nChilbolton which is near Andover are thrown in. But all these lands lie\r\n'into Ciltecumbe.'\r\n\r\n[The many hides at Chilcombe.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that these charters tell lies invented by those who\r\nwished to evade their share of national burdens. And they seem to have\r\nfailed in their object, for in the Confessor's day, though a very large\r\nestate at 'Chilcombe' with nine churches upon it was rated at but one\r\nhide, several of the other villages that we have mentioned were\r\nseparately assessed[1642]. But to lie themselves into an immunity from\r\ntaxes, this the monks might hope to do; to lie themselves into the\r\npossession of square leagues of land, this would have been an impossible\r\nfeat, and the solid fact remains that their church was the lord of a\r\nspacious and continuous block of territory in the very heart of the old\r\nWest Saxon realm, just outside the gates of the royal burg, along the\r\nItchen river, the land that would be seized and settled at the earliest\r\nmoment. The best explanation that they could give of this fact was that\r\nthe first Christian kings had bestowed mile after mile of land upon the\r\nminster. What better theory have we[1643]?\r\n\r\n[The Winchester estates at Downton and Taunton.]\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that some of the very earliest gifts of land that\r\nwere made to the churches might, if we have regard to the size of the\r\nexisting kingdoms, be fairly called the cession of provinces, the\r\ncession of large governmental and jurisdictional districts. The bishops\r\nwant a revenue, and in the earliest days a large district must be ceded\r\nif even a modest revenue is to be produced, for all that the king has to\r\ngive away is the chieftain's right to live at the expense of the folk\r\nand to receive the proceeds of justice. Therefore not only whole\r\nvillages but whole hundreds were given. Chilcombe was by no means the\r\nonly vast estate that the bishop of the West Saxons acquired in very\r\nearly days. Domesday Book shows us how at Downton in Wiltshire the\r\nchurch of Winchester has had a round 100 hides[1644]. For these 100\r\nhides we have a series of charters which professes to begin in the days\r\nwhen the men of Wessex were accepting the new faith. They bear the names\r\nof Cenwealla[1645], Egbert[1646], Edward[1647], Æthelstan[1648],\r\nEdred[1649], Edgar[1650], and Æthelred[1651]. Kemble has accepted the\r\nlast four of them. They tell a consistent story. There were 100 manses\r\nat Downton, or, to speak more accurately, 55 at Downton itself and 45 at\r\nEbbesborne (the modern Bishopston) on the other side of the Avon[1652].\r\nWe might speak of other extensive tracts, of Farnham where there have\r\nbeen 60 hides[1653], of Alresford where there have been 51[1654], of\r\nMitcheldever where there have been 106[1655], of Taunton where there\r\nhave been 54 and more[1656]. Whenever the West Saxons conquer new lands\r\nthey cede a wide province to their bishop. But perhaps we have already\r\nsaid more than enough of these cessions, though in our eyes they are\r\nvery important; they are among the first manifestations of incipient\r\nfeudalism and feudalism brings manorialism in its train. We have\r\nrecurred to them here because the Winchester charters which describe\r\nthem testify strongly to the continuity of the hide and also indicate\r\nthe weak point in the arguments that are urged by the advocates of\r\nlittle hides[1657].\r\n\r\n[Kemble and the Taunton estate.]\r\n\r\nKemble has argued that it is impossible for us to allow the hide of\r\nDomesday Book or the hide or manse of the charters as many as 120 acres.\r\nTake a village, discover how many hides are ascribed to it, discover how\r\nmany acres it has at the present day, you will often find that the whole\r\nterritory of the village will not suffice to supply the requisite number\r\nof hides if the hide is to have 120 or even 60 acres. Kemble illustrates\r\nthis method by taking nine vills in Somerset and Devon. One of them is\r\nTaunton. Modern Taunton, he says, has 2730 acres, the Tantone of 1086\r\nhad 65 hides[1658]; multiply 65 even by so low a figure as 40 and you\r\nwill nearly exhaust all Taunton's soil[1658]. This argument involves the\r\nassumption that the limits of modern Taunton include the whole land that\r\nis ascribed to 'Tantone' in the Conqueror's geld-book. Strangely\r\ndifferent was the result to which Eyton came after a minute examination\r\nof the whole survey of Somersetshire. The 'Tantone' of Domesday covers\r\nsome thirteen or fourteen villages and is now represented not by 2730\r\nbut by 24,000 acres[1659]. The editor of the Anglo-Saxon charters should\r\nhave guessed that many hides 'lay in' Taunton which as a matter of\r\nphysical geography were far off from the walls of the bishop's\r\nburg[1660]. There are counties in which the list of the places that are\r\nmentioned in Domesday is so nearly identical with the list of our modern\r\nparishes, that no very great risk would be run if we circumspectly\r\npursued Kemble's method; but just in those counties to which he applied\r\nit the risk is immeasurably great, for it is the land where many\r\nvillages are often collected into one great _manerium_ and all their\r\nhides are spoken of as lying in one place. Not until we have compared\r\nthe whole survey of the county with the whole of its modern map, are we\r\nentitled to make even a guess as to the amount of land that a place-name\r\ncovers. Often enough in those shires where there are large and ancient\r\necclesiastical estates, those shires in which the feudal and manorial\r\ndevelopment began earliest and has gone furthest, hides 'are' in law\r\nwhere they are not in fact. They 'lie into' the hall at which they geld\r\nor the moot-stow to which they render soke, and this may be far distant\r\nfrom their natural bed[1661].\r\n\r\n[Difficulty of identifying parcels.]\r\n\r\nAs we go backwards this danger is complicated by another, namely, by the\r\ngrowth of new villages. The village of Hamton has been a large village\r\nwith 20 hides. Some of its arable land has lain two or three miles from\r\nthe clustered steads. A partition of its fields is made and a new\r\ncluster of steads is formed; for housebuilding is not a lengthy or\r\ncostly process. And so Little Hamton or 'Other' Hamton with 5 hides\r\nsplits off from the old Hamton which has 15. We must not now try to\r\nforce 20 hides into the territory of either village[1662]. And as this\r\ndanger increases, the other hardly diminishes, for we come to the time\r\nwhen a king will sometimes give a large jurisdictional district and call\r\nit all by one name. If the once heathen Osric of the Hwiccas gave to a\r\nchurch '100 _manentes_ adjoining the city that is called the Hot Baths,'\r\nhe in all probability gave away the 'hundred' of Bath; he gave Bath\r\nitself and a territory which in the eleventh century was the site of a\r\ndozen villages[1663]. We have the best reason for believing that when a\r\nking of the eighth century says that he is giving 20 manses in the place\r\ncalled Cridie he is giving his rights over a tract which comprises ten\r\nor twelve of our modern parishes and more than the whole of the modern\r\nhundred of Crediton[1664].\r\n\r\n[The numerous hides in ancient documents.]\r\n\r\nWe have given above some figures which will enable our readers to\r\ncompare the hides and the teamlands of a county with its modern acreage.\r\nAlso we have confessed to thinking that we can hardly concede to every\r\nteamland that Domesday mentions 120 statute acres of arable land[1665].\r\nOn the other hand, we do not think that there would in general be much\r\ndifficulty in finding 120 arable acres for every fiscal hide, though\r\nperhaps in the south the average size of the acre would be small[1666].\r\nHowever, we have admitted, or rather contended, that before the middle\r\nof the eleventh century the hides of the fiscal system had strayed far\r\naway from the original type, and the sight of an over-hided vill would\r\nnot disconcert us. But unfortunately we can not be content with such\r\nresults as we have as yet attained. We have already seen that the hides\r\nattributed to a district show a tendency to increase their number as we\r\ntrace them backwards[1667], and there are certain old documents which\r\ndeal out hides so lavishly that we must seriously face the question\r\nwhether, notwithstanding the continuity of the land-books, we must not\r\nsuppose that some large change has taken place in the character of the\r\ntypical tenement.\r\n\r\n[_The Burghal Hidage._]\r\n\r\nWe have said above that we have inherited three ancient documents which\r\ndistribute hides among districts. We call them in order of date (1) The\r\nTribal Hidage, (2) The Burghal Hidage, (3) The County Hidage. Of the\r\nyoungest we have spoken. We must now attend to that which holds the\r\nmiddle place. It states that large round numbers of hides belong to\r\ncertain places, which seem to be strongholds. The sense in which a large\r\nnumber of hides might belong to a _burh_ will be clear to those who have\r\nread the foregoing pages[1668]. This document has only come down to us\r\nin a corrupt form, but it has come from a remote time and seems to\r\nrepresent a scheme of West-Saxon defence which was antiquated long years\r\nbefore the coming of the Normans. We will give its effect, preserving\r\nthe most important variants and adding within brackets some guesses of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n                         THE BURGHAL HIDAGE[1669]\r\n                                                                Hides.\r\n  to Heorepeburan, Heorewburan[1670]                              324\r\n  to Hastingecestre [Hastings]                              15 or 500\r\n  to Lathe, Lawe [Lewes][1671]                                   1300\r\n  to Burhham [Burpham near Arundel]                               726\r\n  to Cisseceastre [Chichester]                                   1500\r\n  to Portecheastre [Porchester]                                   650\r\n  to Hamtona and to Wincestre [Southampton and Winchester]       2400\r\n  to Piltone, Pistone[1672], Wiltone [Wilton]                    1400\r\n  to Tysanbyring [Tisbury][1673]                                  700\r\n  to Soraflesbyring, Soraflesburieg, Sceaftesbyrig [Shaftesbury]  700\r\n  to Thoriham, Tweonham, Twenham [Twyneham][1674]                 470\r\n  to Weareham [Wareham]                                          1600\r\n  to Brydian [Bridport or more probably Bredy][1675]             1760\r\n  to Excencestre [Exeter]                                         734\r\n  to Halganwille, Hallgan Wylla [Halwell][1676]                   300\r\n  to Hlidan, Hlida [Lidford]                                      140\r\n  to Wiltone Wisbearstaple, Piltone wið Bearstaple [Pilton[1677]\r\n        with Barnstaple]                                          360\r\n  to Weted, Weced [Watchet][1678]                                 513\r\n  to Orenbrege, Oxenebrege, Axanbrige [Axbridge]                  400\r\n  to Lenge, Lengen [Lyng][1679]                                   100\r\n  to Langiord, Langport [Langport]                                600\r\n  to Bathan, Badecan, Baderan [Bath]                             3200(?)\r\n  to Malmesberinge [Malmesbury]                                  1500\r\n  to Croccegelate, Croccagelada [Cricklade]              1003 or 1300\r\n  to Oxeforde and to Wallingeforde [Oxford and Wallingford]      2400\r\n  to Buckingham and to Sceaftelege, Sceafteslege, Steaftesege\r\n        [Buckingham and ?][1680]                          600 or 1500\r\n  to Eschingum and to Suthringa geweorc [Southwark\r\n        and Eashing][1681]                                       1800\r\n\r\nThese figures having been stated, we are told that they make a total of\r\n27,070 hides[1682]. And then we read 'et triginta[1683] to Astsexum\r\n[_al._ Westsexum], and to Wygraceastrum mcc, hydas. to Wæringewice\r\n[_al._ Parlingewice] feower and xxiiii. hund hyda.'\r\n\r\n[Meaning of _The Burghal Hidage._]\r\n\r\nApparently we start at some burg in the extreme east of Sussex, go\r\nthrough Hastings, Lewes, Burpham, Chichester, Porchester, and then pass\r\nthrough Hampshire, through the south of Wiltshire, through Dorset to\r\nDevon, keeping always well to the south. Then in Devon we turn to the\r\nnorth and retrace our steps by moving to the east along a more northerly\r\nroute than that which we followed in the first instance. In short, we\r\nmake a round of Wessex and end at Southwark. This done, we cast up the\r\nnumber of hides and find them to be somewhat more than 27,000. Then in\r\nwhat may be a postscript the remark is made that to Essex and Worcester\r\nbelong 1200 hides (probably 1200 apiece) and to Warwick 2404. The writer\r\nseems to know Wessex pretty thoroughly; of the rest of England he (if he\r\nadded the postscript) has little to tell us. We might perhaps imagine\r\nhim drawing up this statement under Edward the Elder[1684]. He hears\r\nreports of what has been done to make Essex defensible and of two famous\r\nburgs built in Mercia; but the military system of Wessex he knows[1685].\r\nOf a military system it is that he is telling us. He does not take the\r\ncounties of Wessex one by one; he visits the burgs, and his tour through\r\nthem takes him twice through Wiltshire: westwards along a southerly and\r\neastwards along a northerly line.\r\n\r\nIt is an artificial system that he discloses to us. The 324 hides\r\nallotted to 'Heorepeburan' (a place that eludes us) may seem\r\ninsufficiently round until we add it to the 726 given to 'Burhham.' The\r\nWiltshire burgs seem to be grouped thus:--\r\n\r\n              Wilton     1400}\r\n              Tisbury     700}   2800}\r\n              Shaftesbury 700}       }    5600\r\n              Malmesbury 1500}   2800}\r\n              Cricklade  1300}\r\n\r\n[_The Burghal Hidage_ and later documents.]\r\n\r\nTo compare these figures with those given in Domesday Book and in The\r\nCounty Hidage is not a straightforward task, for the military districts\r\nof 900 may not have been coincident with the counties of 1086, and, for\r\nexample, Bath may have been supported partly by Gloucestershire and\r\npartly by Somerset[1686]. The best comparison that we can make is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n                  Burghal Hidage   County Hidage   Domesday Book\r\n    Sussex[1687]         4350                            3474\r\n    Surrey[1688]         1800 (or 3600)                  1830\r\n    Hampshire[1689]      3520                            2588\r\n    Berkshire[1690]      2400                            2473\r\n    Wiltshire[1691]      5600              4800          4050\r\n    Dorset[1692]         3360                            2321\r\n    Somerset[1693]       4813                            2951\r\n    Devon[1694]          1534                            1119\r\n    Oxford               2400              2400          2412\r\n    Buckingham           1500                            2074\r\n    Essex(?)             1200                            2650\r\n    Worcester            1200              1200          1189\r\n    Warwick              2404              1200          1338\r\n\r\nThere is discord here, but also there is concord. According to our\r\nreckoning, the Oxfordshire and Berkshire of Domesday Book have just\r\nabout 2400 hides apiece; then The County Hidage gives Oxfordshire 2400;\r\nand The Burghal Hidage gives 2400 to Oxford and 2400 to Wallingford.\r\nBoth documents give 1200 to Worcester, and this is very close to the\r\nnumber that Domesday Book assigns. Next we see that, with hardly an\r\nexception[1695], all the aberrations of our Burghal Hidage from Domesday\r\nBook lie in one direction. They all point to great reductions of hidage,\r\nwhich seem to have been distributed with a fairly even hand. Further, in\r\nthe case of Wiltshire we see a progressive abatement. The hidage is\r\nlowered from 5600 to 4800 and then to a little over 4000, and the first\r\nreduction seems to have relieved the shire of just one-seventh of its\r\nhides.\r\n\r\n[Criticism of _The Burghal Hidage._]\r\n\r\nNow it seems to us that, on the one hand, we must reckon with this\r\ndocument as with one which, however much it may have been distorted by\r\ncopyists, is or once was a truthful, and possibly an official record,\r\nand that, on the other hand, we can reckon with it and yet retain that\r\nnotion of the hide which we have been elaborating. In a general way it\r\nboth gives support to and receives support from the evidence that has\r\nalready come before us. We have seen reductions of hidage or carucatage\r\nmade in Yorkshire and Leicestershire after the Domesday survey; we have\r\nseen reductions in Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Cambridge,\r\nNorthamptonshire. Here we come upon earlier reductions. They are large;\r\nbut still they are not of such a kind as to make us think that any great\r\nchange has taken place in men's idea of a normal and typical hide. For\r\none thing, we might be rash if we denied that during that miserable\r\ntenth century both the population and the wealth of Wessex were\r\ndeclining, for, despite its Æthelstan and Edgar, a miserable time it\r\nwas. A real extinction of many a 'real hide' there may have been. But\r\nour main explanation will be that, by a process which is gradual and yet\r\ncatastrophic, the ancient exaggerated estimates of population and wealth\r\nare being brought into correspondence with the humbler facts.\r\n\r\n[_The Tribal Hidage._]\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to a more famous and yet older document, namely that\r\nwhich we call The Tribal Hidage[1696]. It assigns large round quantities\r\nof hides to various districts, or rather to various peoples, whose very\r\nnames would otherwise have been unknown to us. We are not about to add\r\nto the commentaries that have been written upon it; but its general\r\nscheme seems to be fairly plain. It begins by allotting to Myrcna land\r\n30,000 hides. On this follow eighteen more or less obscure names to each\r\nof which a sum of hides is assigned; 36,100 hides are distributed\r\nbetween them. Then a grand total of 66,100 is stated. Ten other more or\r\nless obscure names follow, and 19,000 hides are thus disposed of. Then\r\nwe have more intelligible entries:--'East Engle 30,000. East Sexena\r\n7,000. Cantwarena 15,000. South Sexena 7,000. West Sexena 100,000.' Then\r\nwe are told that the complete sum is 242,700, a statement which is not\r\ntrue as the figures stand, for they amount to 244,100. The broad\r\nfeatures, therefore, of this system seem to be these:--It ascribes to\r\nWessex 100,000 hides, to Sussex 7,000, to Kent 15,000, to Essex 7,000,\r\nto East Anglia 30,000, to Mercia 30,000, to the rest of England 55,100.\r\nApparently we must look for this rest of England outside Wessex, Sussex,\r\nKent, Essex and East Anglia and outside the Mercians' land, though this\r\nlast term is probably used in an old and therefore narrow sense. The\r\nleast obscure of the obscure names that are put before us, those of the\r\ndwellers in the Peak, the dwellers in Elmet and the men of Lindsey, seem\r\nto point to the same conclusion[1697].\r\n\r\n[Criticism of _The Tribal Hidage_.]\r\n\r\nNow our first remark about this document will perhaps be either that it\r\nis wild nonsense, or that its 'hide' has for its type something very\r\ndifferent from the model that has served for those hides of which we\r\nhave hitherto been reading. Domesday will not allow the whole of England\r\n70,000 hides (carucates, sulungs) and now we are asked to accommodate\r\nmore than 240,000. Kent is to have 15,000 hides instead of 1200 sulungs.\r\nEven the gulf between The Burghal Hidage and this Tribal Hidage is\r\nenormous. The one would attribute less than 4500 hides to the Sussex\r\nburgs, the other would burden the South Saxons with 7000. In the older\r\ndocument Wessex has 100,000 hides, while in the younger the burgs of\r\nSurrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset and Devon have\r\nas their contributories less than a quarter of that number. The\r\nsuspicion can not but cross our mind that the 'hides' of The Tribal\r\nHidage are yard-lands, or, in other words have for their moulding idea\r\nrather a tenement of 30 than a tenement of 120 arable acres[1698].\r\n\r\n[Bede's hidage.]\r\n\r\nBefore we decide this important question we must give audience to Bede,\r\nwhose testimony seems to point in the same direction. As already said,\r\nhe uses one and the same unit, namely, the land of a family, whenever he\r\nspeaks of a tract of soil, whether that tract be the territory of a\r\nlarge tribe or an estate that is granted to a monastery. He gives 7000\r\nof these units to the South Saxons, 5000 to the South Mercians, 7000 to\r\nthe North Mercians, 960 to Anglesey, 300 and more to Man, 600 to Thanet,\r\n1200 to Wight, 600 to the Isle of Ely, 87 to the promontory of Selsey, 5\r\nto Iona. Then he tells how Alchfrid bestowed on Wilfrid the land of 10\r\nfamilies at Stanford and a monastery of 30 families at Ripon, and in\r\nvarious other cases we hear of a prelate acquiring the land of 20, 12,\r\n10, 8 families or of one family[1699].\r\n\r\n[Criticism of Bede's hidage.]\r\n\r\nNow we must notice that in their estimates of one large province there\r\nis a certain agreement between the Ecclesiastical History and The Tribal\r\nHidage. Both give the South Saxons 7000 hides or families[1700]. What\r\nare we then to say? If we suppose that Bede is speaking to us of\r\ntenements which tend to conform to the hide of 120 arable acres his\r\nstatements must fly far beyond their mark. For example, the Isle of\r\nWight is to have 1200 hides, and yet, according to Domesday Book, the\r\nwhole of Hampshire including that island will not have 3000 hides, nor\r\n3000 'teamlands,' nor 3000 teams. Bede's Wight contains as many hides as\r\nthe Worcestershire or the Herefordshire of Domesday. He allots 600 of\r\nhis units to the Isle of Ely, which in 1086 had about 80 hides and 126\r\nteamlands. He allots another 600 of his units to the Isle of Thanet,\r\nwhich in 1086 had about 66 sulungs and 93 teamlands[1701].\r\n\r\n[Bede and the large hide.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the critical point in our essay. Before us lie two\r\npaths and it is hardly too much to say that our whole conception of\r\nearly English history depends on the choice that we make. Either as we\r\npursue our retrogressive course through the centuries there comes a time\r\nwhen the hide of 120 acres gives place to some other and much smaller\r\ntypical tenement, or the men of Bede's day grossly exaggerated the\r\nnumber of the hides that there were in England and the various parts\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n[Continuity of the hide in the land-books.]\r\n\r\nWe make our choice. We refuse to abandon the large hide. In the first\r\nplace, we call to mind the continuity of the charters. They have begun\r\nto flow in Bede's day; they never cease to flow until they debouch in\r\nDomesday Book. They know but one tenemental unit. To describe it they\r\nuse Bede's phrase, and his translator's phrases. It is the _hiwisc_, the\r\n_terra unius familiae_, the _terra unius manentis_, the manse, the\r\nhide[1702]. Between this and the acre they know nothing except the yard\r\nof land. Of it they speak but seldom, and it can only be explained as\r\nbeing a yard in every acre of a hide. No moment can we fix when an old\r\nmode of reckoning by reference to small tenements is superseded by\r\nreferences to a fourfold larger model.\r\n\r\n[Gradual reduction of hidage.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we have been prepared for exaggeration. We have\r\nseen the hides steadily increasing in number as we passed from Domesday\r\nBook to The County Hidage and thence to The Burghal Hidage, and what may\r\nwe not expect in the remote age that we have now reached? Even in the\r\ndays of The Burghal Hidage there was a kingdom of England. There was a\r\nking of the English who was trying to coordinate his various dominions\r\nin one common scheme of national defence. But now we have penetrated to\r\nan age when there is no English nation. The _gens Anglorum_ whose\r\necclesiastical history is being written is but a loose congeries of\r\nkindred folks. Rude indeed will be the guesses made at such a time about\r\nthe strength of tribes and the wealth of countries. The South Mercians\r\nare a folk of 5000 families, 'so they say':--that is all that Bede can\r\ntell us about them. It is not likely that they have underestimated their\r\nnumbers. When there is a kingdom of England, when there is a crushing\r\ntax called 'danegeld,' then the day will have come when a county will,\r\nif it can, 'conceal' its hides. At an earlier time the various folks\r\nwill brag of their strength and there will be none to mitigate their\r\nboasts.\r\n\r\nMoreover we can not put our finger on the spot where the breach of\r\ncontinuity occurs. In 1086 Sussex has about 3100 teamlands; it has about\r\n3500 hides. The Burghal Hidage would burden it with nearly 4500, and now\r\nwe are required to give it 7000. There is no place where we can see its\r\nhides suddenly multiplied or divided by four.\r\n\r\n[Over-estimates of hidage.]\r\n\r\nDare we set any limit to the power of exaggeration? In much later days\r\nwhen England had long been strongly governed and accurate fiscal rolls\r\nwere being carefully stored in the treasury, men believed in 60,000\r\nknight's fees; royal ministers believed in 32,000; and yet we now see\r\ngood reason for doubting whether there were more than 5000[1703]. In the\r\nreign of Edward III. the collective wisdom of the nation supposed, and\r\nacted upon the supposition, that there were more than 40,000 parishes in\r\nEngland, and then made the humiliating discovery that there were less\r\nthan 9000[1704]. We hear that the same error was current in the days of\r\nWolsey. Men still believed in those 40,000 parishes[1705]. Such numbers\r\nas these stood written in ancient manuscripts, some of which seem to\r\nhave taken our Tribal Hidage as a base for calculations[1706]. These\r\ntraditional numbers will not be lightly abandoned, though their\r\nfalsehood might be proved by a few days' labour spent among the official\r\narchives. Counting hides is repulsive work. If then these things happen\r\nin an age which is much closer to our own than to Bede's, ought we not\r\nto be surprised at the moderation of those current estimates of tribal\r\nstrength that he reports?\r\n\r\n[Size of Bede's hide.]\r\n\r\nThirdly, when Bede speaks not of a large province, but of an estate\r\nacquired by a prelate, then his story seems to require that 'the land of\r\none family' should be that big tenemental unit, the manse or hide of the\r\nland-books. Let us take by way of example the largest act of liberality\r\nthat he records. King Oswy, going to battle, promises that if he be\r\nvictorious he will devote to God his daughter with twelve estates for\r\nthe endowment of monasteries. He is victorious; he fulfils his vow. He\r\ngives twelve estates, six in Deira, six in Bernicia; each consists of\r\n'the possessions of ten families.' His daughter enters Hild's monastery\r\nat Hartlepool. Two years afterwards she acquires an estate of ten\r\nfamilies at Streanaeshalch and founds a monastery there. According to\r\nour reading of the story, Oswy bestows twelve 'ten-hide vills'; he\r\ngives, that is, his rights, his superiority, over twelve villages of\r\nabout the average size, some of which are in Deira, some in Bernicia.\r\nIt is a handsome gift made on a grand occasion and in return for a\r\nmagnificent victory; but it is on the scale of those gifts whereof we\r\nread in the West Saxon and Mercian land-books, where the hides are given\r\naway by fives and tens, fifteens and twenties. We feel no temptation to\r\nmake thirty-acre yard-lands of the units that Oswy distributed. Were we\r\nto do this, we should see him bestowing not entire villages (for a\r\nvillage of two-and-a-half hides would, at all events in later days, be\r\nabnormally small) but a few of the tenements that lie in one village and\r\na few of those that lie in another, and such a gift would not be like\r\nthose gifts that the oldest land-books record. And so we think that the\r\nunit which Bede employs is our large hide. When he speaks of the estates\r\ngiven to those churches with whose affairs he is conversant, he will\r\nstate the hidage correctly; but when it comes to the hidage of Sussex or\r\nKent, he will report current beliefs which are far from the truth. This\r\nis what we see in later days. The officers at the Exchequer know\r\nperfectly well that this man has fifty knight's fees and that man five,\r\nbut opine that there are 32,000, or, may be, 60,000 fees in\r\nEngland[1707].\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Iona.]\r\n\r\nObserve how moderate Bede's estimate of hidage is when he speaks of a\r\nsmall parcel of land of which he had heard much, when he speaks of the\r\nholy island of Hii or Iona. A Pictish king gave it to Columba, who\r\nreceived it as a site for a monastery. 'Neque enim magna est, sed quasi\r\nfamiliarum quinque, iuxta aestimationem Anglorum[1708] 'It is not a\r\nlarge island; we might compare its size with that of one of our English\r\nfive-hide túns.' The comparison would be apt. Iona has 1300 Scotch\r\nacres or thereabouts[1708]. Plough 600 acres; there will be ample\r\npasture left[1710]. If, however, we interpreted his statement about the\r\n7000 hides of Sussex in a similar fashion, the result would be\r\nridiculous. The South Saxons had not 840,000 acres of arable; our Sussex\r\nhas not 940,000 acres of any kind; their Sussex was thickly wooded. The\r\ncontrast, however, is not between two measures; it is between knowledge\r\nand ignorance. Bede's name is and ought to be venerated, and to accuse\r\nhim of talking nonsense may seem to some an act of sacrilege. But about\r\nthese matters he could only tell what was told him, and we may be sure\r\nthat his informants, were, to say the least, no better provided with\r\nstatistics than were the statesmen of the fourteenth century[1711].\r\n\r\n[Evidence from Selsey.]\r\n\r\nAlso there is one case in which we have what may be called a very\r\nancient, though not a contemporary, exposition of Bede's words. He tells\r\nus that Æthelwealh king of the South Saxons gave to Wilfrid the land of\r\n87 families called Selsey[1712]. Then there comes to us from Chichester\r\nthe copy of a land-book which professes to tell us more touching the\r\nwhereabouts of these 87 hides[1713]. Ceadwealla with the approval of\r\nArchbishop Wilfrid gives to a Bishop Wilfrid a little land for the\r\nconstruction of a monastery in the place called Selsey: 'that is to say\r\n55 _tributarii_ in the places that are called Seolesige, Medeminige,\r\nWihttringes, Iccannore, Bridham and Egesauude and also Bessenheie,\r\nBrimfastun and Sidelesham with the other _villae_ thereto belonging and\r\ntheir appurtenances; also the land named Aldingburne and Lydesige 6\r\n_cassati_, and in Geinstedisgate 6, and in Mundham 8, and in Amberla and\r\nHohtun 8, and in Uualdham 4: that is 32 _tributarii_.' This instrument\r\nbears date 683. Another purporting to come from 957 describes the land\r\nin much the same fashion[1714]. Where, let us ask, did the makers of\r\nthese charters propose to locate the 87 hides? Some, though not all, of\r\nthe places that they mentioned can be easily found on the map. We see\r\nSelsey itself; hard by are Medmeny or Medmerry, Wittering, Itchenor,\r\nBirdham and Siddlesham. At these and some other places that are not now\r\nto be found were 55 hides. Then we go further afield and discover\r\nAldingbourn, Lidsey, Mundham, Amberley, Houghton and perhaps Upper\r\nWaltham. But we have travelled far. At Amberley and Houghton we are\r\nfifteen miles as the crow flies from Selsey[1715]. Apparently then, the\r\n87 hides consist of a solid block of villages at and around Selsey\r\nitself and of more distant villages that are dotted about in the\r\nneighbourhood. Be it granted that these land-books are forgeries; still\r\nin all probability they are a good deal older than Domesday Book[1716].\r\nBe it granted that the number of 87 hides was suggested to the forgers\r\nby the words of Bede[1717]. Still we must ask what meaning they gave to\r\nthose words. They distributed the 87 hides over a territory which is at\r\nleast eighteen miles in diameter[1718]. Now it is by no means unlikely\r\nthat Æthelwealh's gift really included some villages that were remote\r\nfrom Selsey. We have seen before now that lands in one village may 'lie\r\ninto' another and a distant village which is the moot-stow of a\r\n'hundred.' But at any rate the forgers were not going to attempt the\r\nimpossible task of cramming 'the land of 87 families' into the Selsey\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\n[Conclusion in favour of the large hide.]\r\n\r\nTherefore, in spite of Bede and The Tribal Hidage, we still remain\r\nfaithful to the big hide. We have seen reason for believing that in the\r\noldest days the real number of the 'real' hides was largely\r\nover-estimated. It would be an interesting, though perhaps an\r\nunanswerable, question whether any governmental or fiscal arrangements\r\nwere ever based upon these inflated figures. A negative answer would\r\nseem the more probable. In Bede's day there was no one to tax all\r\nEngland or to force upon all England a scheme of national defence. So\r\nsoon as anything that we could dare to call a government of England came\r\ninto being, the truth, the unpleasant truth, would become apparent bit\r\nby bit. All along bits of the truth were well enough known. The number\r\nof hides in a village was known to the villagers; the kingling knew the\r\nnumber of hides that contributed to his maintenance. As the folks were\r\nfused together, these dispersed bits of truth would be slowly pieced\r\ninto a whole, though for a long while the work of coordination would be\r\nhampered by old mythical estimates. Perhaps The Burghal Hidage may\r\nrepresent one of the first attempts to arrange for political purposes\r\nthe hides of a large province. There is still exaggeration, and,\r\nunfortunately for us, new causes of perplexity are introduced as the\r\nolder disappear. On the one hand, statesmen are beginning to know\r\nsomething about the facts; on the other hand, they are beginning to\r\nperceive that tenements of equal size are often of very unequal value,\r\nand to give the name _hide_ to whatever is taxed as such. Also there is\r\nprivilege to be reckoned with, and there is jobbery. It is a tangled\r\nskein. And yet they are holding fast the equation 1H. = 120A.\r\n\r\n[Continental analogies.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another point of view from which the evidence should\r\nbe examined, though a point to which we can not climb. How will our big\r\nhide assort with the evidence that comes to us from abroad? Only a few\r\nwords about this question can we hazard.\r\n\r\n[The German _Hufe_.]\r\n\r\nIf we look to the villages of Germany, or at any rate of some parts of\r\nGermany, we see that the typical fully endowed peasant holds a mass of\r\ndispersed acre-strips, a _Hufe, hoba mansus_ which, while it falls far\r\nshort of our hide, closely resembles our virgate. The resemblance is\r\nclose. As our virgate is compounded of acres, so this _Hufe_ is\r\ncompounded of acres, or day's-works, or mornings (_Morgen_). When the\r\ntime for accurate measurement comes, these day-work-units differ\r\nsomewhat widely in extent as we pass from one district to another. The\r\nEnglish statute acre is, as we have already said[1719], an unusually\r\nlarge day-work-unit. It contains 40.46 _ares_, while in Germany, if\r\nthere is nothing exceptional in the case, the _Morgen_ will have no more\r\nthan from 25 to 30 _ares_[1720]. This notwithstanding, the _Hufe_, is\r\ngenerally supposed to contain either 30 or else 60 _Morgen_, the former\r\nreckoning being the commoner. In the one case it would resemble our\r\nvirgate, in the other our half-hide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Königshufe_.]\r\n\r\nThen, however, we see--and it has occurred to us that some solution of\r\nour difficulty might lie in this quarter--that in Germany there appears\r\nsporadically a unit much larger than the ordinary _Hufe_, which is known\r\nas a _Königshufe_ or _mansus regalis_. This is sometimes reckoned to\r\ncontain 160, but sometimes 120 _Morgen_. It seems to be an unit\r\naccurately measured by a _virga regalis_ of 4·70 meters and to contain\r\n21,600 square _virgae_. In size it would closely resemble an English\r\nhide of 120 statute acres; the one would contain 47·736, the other 48·56\r\nhectares. To explain the appearance of these large units by the side of\r\nthe ordinary _Hufen_, it has been said that as the Emperor or German\r\nking reigned over wide territories and had much land to give away, he\r\nfelt the need of some accurate standard for the measurement of his own\r\ngifts, so that he might be able to dispose of 'five manses' or 'ten\r\nmanses' in some distant province and yet know exactly what he was doing.\r\nThis theory, however, does not tell us why the unit that was thus chosen\r\nand called a king's _Hufe_ or 'royal manse' was much larger than an\r\nordinary manse or _Hufe_, and we seem invited to suppose that at some\r\ntime or another a notion had prevailed that when an allotment of land in\r\na village was made to a king, he should have for his tenement twice or\r\nthrice or four times as many strips as would fall to the lot of the\r\ncommon man[1721].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English hide and the _Königshufe_.]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion then might be made that the manse, _terra unius familiae,\r\nterra unius manentis_, of our English documents is not the typical\r\nmanse of the common man, but the typical king's-manse. We might\r\nconstruct the following story:--When England was being settled, the\r\npractice was to give the common man about 30 acres to his manse, but to\r\ngive the king 120. Thus in the administration of the royal lands a\r\n'manse' would stand for this large unit. Then this same unit was\r\nemployed in the computation of the _feorm_, _victus_ or _pastus_ that\r\nwas due to the king from other lands, and finally the royal reckoning\r\ngot so much the upper hand that when men spoke of a 'manse' or a 'family\r\nland' they meant thereby, not the typical estate of the common man, but\r\na four times larger unit which was thrust upon their notice by fiscal\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n[The large hide on the Continent.]\r\n\r\nSome such suggestion as this may deserve consideration if all simpler\r\ntheories break down. But it is not easily acceptable. It supposes that\r\nin a very early and rude age a natural use of words was utterly and\r\ntracelessly expelled by a highly technical and artificial use. This\r\nmight happen in a much governed country which was full of royal\r\nofficials; we can hardly conceive it happening in the England of the\r\nseventh and eighth centuries. Moreover, the continental evidence does\r\nnot lie all on one side. There was, for instance, one district in\r\nNorthern Germany where the term _Hufe_ was given to an area that was but\r\na trifle smaller than 120 acres of our statute measure[1722]. Also there\r\nare the large Scandinavian allotments to be considered. Even in Gaul on\r\nthe estates of St. Germain the _mansus ingenuilis_ sometimes contained,\r\nif Guérard's calculations are correct, fully as much arable land as we\r\nare giving to the hide[1723]. Nor, though we may dispute about the\r\ndegree of difference, can it be doubted that the Germanic conquest of a\r\nBritain that the legions had deserted was catastrophic when compared\r\nwith the slow process by which the Franks and other tribes gained the\r\nmastery in Gaul. Just in the matter of agrarian allotment this\r\ndifference might show itself in a striking form. The more barbarous a\r\nman is, the more land he must have to feed himself withal, if corn is to\r\nbe his staple food. There were no ecclesiastics in England to maintain\r\nthe continuity of agricultural tradition. Also the heathen Germans in\r\nEngland had a far better chance of providing themselves with slaves than\r\nhad their cousins on the mainland. Also it seems very possible that\r\nthroughout the wide and always growing realm of the Frankish king, the\r\nfiscal nomenclature would be fixed by the usages which obtained in the\r\nrichest and most civilized of those lands over which he reigned, and\r\nthat the 'manse' that was taken as the unit for taxation was really a\r\nmuch smaller tenement than supported a family in the wilder and ruder\r\neast. Besides, when in Frankland a tax is imposed which closely\r\nresembles and may have been the model for our danegeld, the _mansus\r\ningenuilis_ pays twice as much as the _mansus servilis_[1724]. This\r\nsuggests that the Frankish statesmen have two different typical\r\ntenements in their minds, whereas in England all the hides pay equally.\r\n\r\n[The large hide not too large.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt at first sight 120 arable acres seem a huge tenement for the\r\nmaintenance of one family. But, though the last word on this matter can\r\nnot be spoken by those ignorant alike of agriculture and physiology,\r\nstill they may be able to forward the formation of a sound judgment by\r\ncalling attention to some points which might otherwise be neglected. In\r\nthe first place, our 'acre' is a variable whose history is not yet\r\nwritten. Perhaps when written it will tell us that the oldest English\r\nacres fell decidedly short of the measure that now bears that name and\r\neven that a rod of 12 feet was not very uncommon. Secondly, when our\r\nfancy is catering for thriftless barbarians, we must remember that the\r\ngood years will not compensate for the bad. Every harvest, however poor,\r\nmust support the race for a twelvemonth. Thirdly, we must think away\r\nthat atmosphere of secure expectation in which we live. When wars and\r\nblood-feuds and marauding forays are common, men must try to raise much\r\nfood if they would eat a little. Fourthly, we must not light-heartedly\r\ntransport the three-course or even the two-course programme of\r\nagriculture into the days of conquest and settlement. It is not\r\nimpossible that no more than one-third of the arable was sown in any\r\nyear[1725]. Fifthly, we may doubt whether Arthur Young was further in\r\nadvance of Walter of Henley than Walter was of the wild heathen among\r\nwhom the hides were allotted; and yet Walter, with all his learned talk\r\nof marl and manure, of second-fallowing and additional furrows, faced\r\nthe possibility of garnering but six bushels from an acre[1726].\r\nSixthly, we have to provide for men who love to drink themselves drunk\r\nwith beer[1727]. Their fields of barley will be wide, for their thirst\r\nis unquenchable. Seventhly, without speaking of 'house-communities,' we\r\nmay reasonably guess that the household was much larger in the seventh\r\nthan it was in the eleventh century. We might expect to find married\r\nbrothers or even married cousins under one roof. Eighthly, there seems\r\nno reason why we should not allow the free family some slaves: perhaps a\r\ncouple of huts inhabited by slaves; there had been war enough. Ninthly,\r\nthe villein of the thirteenth century will often possess a full virgate\r\nof 30 acres, and yet will spend quite half his time in cultivating his\r\nlord's demesne. Tenthly, in Domesday Book the case of the _villanus_ who\r\nholds an integral hide is by no means unknown[1728], nor the case of the\r\n_villanus_ who has a full team of oxen. When all this has been thought\r\nover, let judgment be given. Meanwhile we can not abandon that belief to\r\nwhich the evidence has brought us, namely, that the normal tenement of\r\nthe German settler was a hide, the type of which had 120 acres of\r\narable, little more or less.\r\n\r\n[The large hide and the manor.]\r\n\r\nIf we are right about this matter, then, as already said[1729], some\r\nimportant consequences follow. We may once and for all dismiss as a\r\ndream any theory which would teach us that from the first the main and\r\nnormal constitutive cell in the social structure of the English people\r\nhas been the manor. To call the ceorl's tenement of 120 acres a manor,\r\nthough it may have a few slaves to till it, would be a grotesque misuse\r\nof words, nor, if there is to be clear thinking, shall we call it an\r\nembryo manor, for by no gradual process can a manor be developed from\r\nit. There must be a coagulation of some three or four such tenements\r\ninto a single proprietary unit before that name can be fairly earned.\r\nThat from the first there were units which by some stretch of language\r\nmight be called manors is possible. The noble man, the eorl, may have\r\nusually had at least those five hides which in later days were regarded\r\nas the proper endowment for a thegn, and these large estates may have\r\nbeen cultivated somewhat after the manorial fashion by the slaves and\r\nfreed-men of their owners. But the language of Bede and of the charters\r\nassures us that the arrangement which has been prevalent enough to be\r\ntypical has been that which gave to each free family, to each\r\nhouse-father, to each tax-payer (_tributarius_) one hide and no more;\r\nbut no less. Such a use of words is not engendered by rarities and\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\n[Last words.]\r\n\r\nHowever, we would not end this essay upon a discord. Therefore a last\r\nand peaceful word. There is every reason why the explorers of ancient\r\nEnglish history should be hopeful. We are beginning to learn that there\r\nare intricate problems to be solved and yet that they are not insoluble.\r\nA century hence the student's materials will not be in the shape in\r\nwhich he finds them now. In the first place, the substance of Domesday\r\nBook will have been rearranged. Those villages and hundreds which the\r\nNorman clerks tore into shreds will have been reconstituted and pictured\r\nin maps, for many men from over all England will have come within King\r\nWilliam's spell, will have bowed themselves to him and become that man's\r\nmen. Then there will be a critical edition of the Anglo-Saxon charters\r\nin which the philologist and the palæographer, the annalist and the\r\nformulist will have winnowed the grain of truth from the chaff of\r\nimposture. Instead of a few photographed village maps, there will be\r\nmany; the history of land-measures and of field-systems will have been\r\nelaborated. Above all, by slow degrees the thoughts of our forefathers,\r\ntheir common thoughts about common things, will have become thinkable\r\nonce more. There are discoveries to be made; but also there are habits\r\nto be formed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1616] See above, p. 389.\r\n\r\n  [1617] See above, p. 393.\r\n\r\n  [1618] Dr Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. 79, has endeavoured to find a _via\r\n         media_. To me it seems that his suggestion is open to almost\r\n         all the objections that can be urged against our Big Hide,\r\n         for he seems prepared to give the normal household of the\r\n         oldest day its 120 acres. Mr Seebohm's adhesion to the party\r\n         of the Big Hide is of importance, for I can not but think\r\n         that a small hide (which afterwards was called a virgate)\r\n         would have assorted better with his general theory.\r\n         Conversely, it is curious that Kemble, the champion of the\r\n         free ceorls, was also the champion, if not the inventor, of\r\n         the Little Hide.\r\n\r\n  [1619] See above, p. 385.\r\n\r\n  [1620] D.

As a general rule the\r\n         charters will account for just about the right number of\r\n         manses, if the manses are to be the hides. There are\r\n         exceptions; but not more than might be fairly explained by\r\n         changes such as those recorded in the following words (Chron.\r\n         Abingd. i. 270):--'Fuerunt autem Witham, Seouecurt,\r\n         Henstesie, Eatun membra de Cumenora temporibus Eadgari regis\r\n         Angliae, habentes cassatos xxv; nunc vero Hensteseie membrum\r\n         est de Bertona; Witheham et Seouecurt militibus datae; Eatun\r\n         omnìmodo ablata.'

Did the monks till the land for some leagues\r\n         around the city? I think not. Was it all occupied by their\r\n         serfs? I think not. What was given was a superiority.

They do not look like late\r\n         forgeries. Those which bear the earliest dates seem to be\r\n         treated as genuine in charters of the tenth century which are\r\n         not (if anything that comes from Winchester is not)\r\n         suspected.\r\n\r\n  [1658] Kemble, Saxons, i. 487; D. B. i. 87 b.\r\n\r\n  [1659] Eyton, Somerset, ii. 34.\r\n\r\n  [1660] See above, p. 499, note 1656.\r\n\r\n  [1661] Compare, for instance, the account of the estates of the\r\n         Bishop of Wells, D. B. i. 89, with the charter ascribed to\r\n         the Confessor, K. 816 (iv. 163). In the former we read of 50\r\n         hides at Wells; in the latter we see that these hides cover\r\n         24 villages or hamlets, each of which has its name. According\r\n         to Eyton (Somerset, 24) this estate extends over nearly\r\n         22,000 acres. The Malmesbury charter, K. 817 (iv. 165) is\r\n         another good illustration. Kemble's identifications were\r\n         hasty and have fared ill at the hands of those who have made\r\n         local researches. A few examples follow:--Keynsham, 50 H. =\r\n         3330 A. (Kemble), 11,138 A. and more (Eyton). Dowlish, 9 H. =\r\n         680 A. (Kemble), 1282 (Eyton). Road, 9 H. = 1010 A. (Kemble),\r\n         1664 (Eyton). Portishead, 11 H. = 1610 (Kemble), 2093\r\n         (Eyton). The instances that Kemble gives (vol. i. p. 106)\r\n         from the A.-S. land-books are equally unfortunate. Thus he\r\n         reads of 50 H. at Brokenborough, Wilts, and seeks for them\r\n         all in a modern parish which has 2950 A.; but the Domesday\r\n         manor of this name covered 'at least 6000 or perhaps 7000\r\n         acres' (W. H. Jones, Domesday for Wilts, p. xxvii.). In\r\n         several instances Kemble tries to force into a single parish\r\n         all the hides of a hundred which takes its name from that\r\n         parish.\r\n\r\n  [1662] Hanssen, Abhandlungen, i. 499.\r\n\r\n  [1663] See above, p. 229, and Mr Taylor's paper there mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [1664] Napier and Stevenson, Crawford Charters, 43. Compare D. B. i.\r\n         101 b. In the Confessor's time 'Crediton' gelded for 15\r\n         hides. There was land for 185 teams, and teams to that number\r\n         existed. There were 264 villeins, 73 bordiers and 40 serfs.\r\n         Æthelheard's charter suggests either that in his day this\r\n         part of Devon was very sparsely peopled, or that already,\r\n         under a system of partitionary taxation, a small number of\r\n         fiscal units had been cast upon a poor district. When at a\r\n         later time Eadnoth bishop of Crediton mortgages a yardland\r\n         for 30 mancuses of gold (Ibid. p. 5), this yardland will be a\r\n         fiscal virgate of wide extent.

If Kent were included in the scheme, we\r\n         should read of Canterbury, Rochester etc. Therefore we\r\n         probably start in Sussex, but at some point east of Hastings.\r\n         In any case, unless a name has dropped out, we can not make\r\n         the five Sussex burgs correspond to the six rapes of a later\r\n         day, which, going from east to west, are Hastings, Pevensey,\r\n         Lewes, Bramber, Arundel, Chichester.\r\n\r\n  [1671] See the Læwe, Læwes of K. 499, 1237.\r\n\r\n  [1672] A confusion of P and W is common.\r\n\r\n  [1673] Tisbury lies between Wilton and Shaftesbury. See K. 104, 641.\r\n         Mr Stevenson suggests that the word may be _Cysanbyrig_,\r\n         thereby being meant Chiselbury Camp. This also lies in the\r\n         right quarter.\r\n\r\n  [1674] _Tweoxneam_, A.-S. Chron. ann. 901.\r\n\r\n  [1675] See _Bridian_ in K. 656. Bredy lies about eight miles west of\r\n         Dorchester. It seems to contain a 'Kingston.'\r\n\r\n  [1676] There is a Halwell a little to the south of Totness. Already\r\n         in 1018 (Crawford Charters, pp. 9, 79) the Devonshire burgs\r\n         are Exeter, Lidford, Totness and Barnstaple.\r\n\r\n  [1677] Pilton lies close to Barnstaple.\r\n\r\n  [1678] A.-S.

Observe that a very small district is assigned\r\n         to Lyng.\r\n\r\n  [1680] After seeing Oxford and Wallingford together, we should\r\n         naturally expect Bedford with Buckingham. See A.-S. Chron.\r\n         ann. 918-9. Or we might look for Hertford. Ibid. ann. 913.\r\n\r\n  [1681] Eashing is a tithing in the parish of Godalming. See King\r\n         Alfred's will (K. 314): 'æt Æscengum.' Eashing may have been\r\n         supplanted by Guildford.\r\n\r\n  [1682] Taking in the particulars the figures which seem the more\r\n         probable, we make a larger total.\r\n\r\n  [1683] If Essex is meant this figure seems impossibly small. Gale\r\n         gives 'Ast Saxhum et Wygeaceastrum 1200 hidas.' This may give\r\n         Essex and Worcester 1200 hides _apiece_.\r\n\r\n  [1684] Mr Stevenson tells me that, though the document is very\r\n         corrupt, some of the verbal forms seem to speak of this date.\r\n\r\n  [1685] Such a document is apt to be tampered with. Some bits of it\r\n         may be older than other bits, but the reign of Edward the\r\n         Elder seems the latest to which we could ascribe its core. If\r\n         we compare it with the list of Domesday boroughs we shall be\r\n         struck by the absence of Dorchester, Bridport, Ilchester,\r\n         Totness, Hertford, Bedford and Guildford, as well as by the\r\n         appearance of Burpham, Tisbury, Bredy, Halwell, Watchet, Lyng\r\n         and Eashing.\r\n\r\n  [1686] See above, p. 189, note 747.\r\n\r\n  [1687] 'Heorepeburan,' Hastings, Lewes, Burpham, Chichester.\r\n\r\n  [1688] Eashing, Southwark.\r\n\r\n  [1689] Porchester, Southampton, Winchester, Twyneham.\r\n\r\n  [1690] Wallingford.\r\n\r\n  [1691] Wilton, Tisbury, Shaftesbury, Malmesbury, Cricklade.\r\n\r\n  [1692] Wareham, Bredy.\r\n\r\n  [1693] Watchet, Axbridge, Lyng, Langport, Bath.\r\n\r\n  [1694] Exeter, Halwell, Lidford, Barnstaple.\r\n\r\n  [1695] A good deal of doubt hangs over the entries touching\r\n         Buckingham, Essex and Warwick.\r\n\r\n  [1696] Birch, Cartularium, i. 414; Birch, Journal Brit. Archæol.\r\n         Assoc. xl. 29 (1884); Earle, Land Charters, 458; Liebermann,\r\n         Leges Anglorum, 8; Stevenson, Engl. Hist. Rev., 1889, 354.\r\n\r\n  [1697] Unless the mention of Wessex is interpolated (and if it be\r\n         interpolated then the grand total has been tampered with) it\r\n         is difficult to suppose that 'Wiht gara 600' points to the\r\n         Isle of Wight, 'Gifla 300' to the district round Ilchester,\r\n         or the like. I owe this observation to Mr W. J. Corbett.\r\n\r\n  [1698] It is a little curious that if we multiply the 244,100 hides\r\n         by 120 we obtain 29,292,000, a figure which is not very far\r\n         off from the 32,543,890 which gives the total acreage (tidal\r\n         water excepted) of modern England. However, it is in the\r\n         highest degree improbable that the computer of hides was\r\n         aiming at pure areal measurement. Nor could his credit be\r\n         saved in that way, for the area of Kent is to that of Sussex\r\n         as 975:932, not as 15:7. The total of 'cultivated land' in\r\n         England is less than 25 million acres, that of arable is less\r\n         than 12 million.\r\n\r\n  [1699] Bede, Hist. Eccl. ii. 9 (ed. Plummer, i. 97): '...

Eccl. iii. 24 (p. 178): 'donatis insuper xii.\r\n         possessiunculis terrarum, in quibus ablato studio militiae\r\n         terrestris, ad exercendam militiam caelestem, supplicandumque\r\n         pro pace gentis eius aeterna, devotioni sedulae monachorum\r\n         locus facultasque suppeteret ... Singulae vero possessiones\r\n         x. erant familiarum, id est simul omnes cxx.' In these\r\n         villages there have been men who owed military service; they\r\n         are not being ousted from their homes; they are being turned\r\n         over as tenants to the church; henceforth they will no longer\r\n         be bound to fight, and in consideration of this precious\r\n         immunity, they will have to supply the monks with provender.\r\n         That is how I read this passage. Others can and will read it\r\n         to mean something very different. But if Bede were speaking\r\n         of _decuriae_ of slaves, how could there be talk of military\r\n         service? The slaves would not fight, and if the slaves\r\n         belonged to eorls who fought, then how comes it that Oswy can\r\n         expropriate his nobles?\r\n\r\n  [1708] Hist. Eccl. iii. 4 (p. 133).\r\n\r\n  [1709] Keith Johnston, Gazetteer.\r\n\r\n  [1709] I do not suggest, nor does Bede suggest, that Hii was laid\r\n         out in hides. He is speaking only of size.\r\n\r\n  [1711] Bede gives to Anglesey the size of 960 families, to Man that\r\n         of 300 'or more.' Anglesey has 175,836 acres; Man 145,011.\r\n         Anglesey in 1895 had 'under all kinds of crops, bare fallow\r\n         and grass (mountain and heath land excluded)' 152,004 acres.\r\n         Man 96,098. Anglesey had 24,798 acres growing corn crops and\r\n         9,305 growing green crops, while the corresponding figures\r\n         for Man were 22,666 and 11,580. Rationalistic explanation of\r\n         Bede's statements would be useless. He is reporting vague\r\n         guesses.\r\n\r\n  [1712] Hist. Eccl. iv. 13 (p. 232): 'Quo tempore Rex Ædilualch\r\n         donavit reverentissimo antistiti Vilfrido terram lxxxvii\r\n         familiarum, ubi suos homines, qui exules vagabantur, recipere\r\n         posset, vocabulo Selæsu, quod dicitur Latine Insula Vituli\r\n         Marini.' Bede goes on to describe the Selsey peninsula and\r\n         Wilfrid's foundation of a monastery. Wilfrid proceeded to\r\n         convert the men who were given him. They included two hundred\r\n         and fifty male and female slaves whom he set at liberty.\r\n\r\n  [1713] K. 992 (v. 32); B. i. 98.\r\n\r\n  [1714] K. 464 (ii. 341). The 55 hides are reduced to 42, no mention\r\n         is made of Medemenige, Egesauude or Bessanheie, and the 32\r\n         hides are somewhat differently distributed.\r\n\r\n  [1715] D. B. i. 17. The Bp of Chichester has 24 hides at Amberley.\r\n\r\n  [1716] I infer this from the thorough discrepancy that there is\r\n         between these charters and D. B. A forger at work after or\r\n         soon before the Conquest would have arranged the church's\r\n         estates in a manner similar to that which we see in King\r\n         William's record.\r\n\r\n  [1717] As a matter of fact, however, it is not very easy to\r\n         reconcile the earlier charter with Bede's story. The charter\r\n         makes the land proceed from the West-Saxon Ceadwealla and\r\n         says nothing of Æthelwealh, who, according to Bede, was the\r\n         donor. Mr Plummer, Bedae Opera, ii. 226, says that the forger\r\n         betrays his hand by calling Wilfrid _arch_bishop. Really he\r\n         seems to cut Wilfrid into two, making of him (1) an\r\n         archbishop, and (2) a bishop of the South Saxons. See the\r\n         attestations.\r\n\r\n  [1718] In D. B. i. 17 the bishop's manor at Selsey has but 10 hides\r\n         and but 7 teamlands.\r\n\r\n  [1719] See above, p. 378.\r\n\r\n  [1720] Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 563.\r\n\r\n  [1721] Meitzen, op. cit., ii. 553-69; iii. 557-61; Lamprecht,\r\n         Deutsches Wirtschaftsleben, i. 348.\r\n\r\n  [1722] Meitzen, op. cit. ii. 566. The Kalenberger _Hufe_ was a\r\n         measure prevalent in the district of Braunschweig-Lüneberg.\r\n         It contained 180 Morgen or 47.147 hectares. A hide made of\r\n         120 statute acres would contain about 48.56 hectares.\r\n         Apparently Dr Meitzen (ii. 113) has found no difficulty in\r\n         accepting a hide of 120 acres as the normal share of the\r\n         English settler.
