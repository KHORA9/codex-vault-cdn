HORNE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo vast and wonderful a construction was the Roman world, so different\r\nfrom our own, that we are apt to imagine it as an arrangement far more\r\ndeliberately planned, far more mechanically complete, than it appeared\r\nto its own inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFrom a cursory glance, we may carry away wholly mistaken conceptions of\r\nits thought and purpose. Thus, for instance, the Roman Republic never\r\nassumed the definite design of conquering the world; its people had only\r\nthe vaguest conception of whither the world might extend. They merely\r\nquarrelled with their neighbors, defeated and then annexed them.\r\n\r\nAt almost any time after Hannibal's death, Rome might have marched her\r\nlegions, practically unopposed, over all the lands within her reach. Yet\r\nshe permitted a century and a half to elapse ere Pompey asserted her\r\nsovereignty over Asia. It was left for Augustus to take the final step,\r\nand, by absorbing Egypt, make his country become in name what it had\r\nlong been in fact, the ruler of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThus, too, we think of Augustus as a kindly despot, supreme, and\r\ngoverned only by his own will. But his compatriots looked on him as\r\nsimply the chief citizen of their republic. They considered that of\r\ntheir own free will, to escape the dangers of further civil war, they\r\nhad chosen to confer upon one man, eminently \"safe and sane,\" all the\r\nhigh offices whose holders had previously battled against one another.\r\nSo Augustus was Emperor or Imperator, which meant no more than general\r\nof the armies of the Republic; he was Consul, or chief civil\r\nadministrator of the Republic; he was Pontifex Maximus, high-priest of\r\nthe Republic. He could have had more titles and offices still if he\r\nwould have accepted them from an obsequious senate.\r\n\r\nBut the title of \"king,\" so obnoxious to Roman taste, Augustus never\r\nsought, nor did his successors, who were in turn appointed to all his\r\noffices. For nearly three centuries after the one-man power had become\r\nabsolute, Rome continued to call itself a republic, to go through forms\r\nof election and ceremonial, which grew ever more and more meaningless\r\nand trivial.\r\n\r\nAugustus seems to have felt the tremendous weight of his position, and\r\nto have tried honestly to divide his authority. He invested the\r\ntrembling senate with both power and responsibility. In theory, it\r\nbecame as influential as he. But the appointment of its members, and\r\nalso the supreme control of the armies, remained always with the\r\nImperator; and thus the senate continued in reality little better than a\r\nflickering shadow. Under the reign of a well-meaning emperor, it loomed\r\nlarge, and often dilated into a very valuable and honorable body. In the\r\ngrip of a tyrant, it sank at once to its true aspect of helpless and\r\nobsequious submission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"ROMAN PEACE\"\r\n\r\nTo the outside world the reign of the emperors was welcome. The\r\nprovinces were governed by salaried officials, whose conduct was\r\nseriously investigated. The hideous extortions and cruelties of the\r\ngovernors sent out in the earlier days of the Republic almost\r\ndisappeared. This milder rule seemed happy in the contrast. An emperor\r\nmight be a brute at home, but his personal cruelties could scarce spread\r\nover an entire world. Money for even the hugest extravagances of only\r\none man, the provinces could supply. At first they scarce felt the\r\ndrain.\r\n\r\nFor two entire centuries after Augustus had assumed power, the world\r\nflourished and apparently prospered under the \"Roman peace.\" The ruins\r\nof Pompeii, the tale of its destruction, show how well and how lazily\r\nthe upper classes and even the masses lived.[1] The legions were scarce\r\nneeded except for petty wars along the frontier. The defeat inflicted by\r\nthe German barbarians was avenged, and the northern wilderness seems to\r\nhave come very near to sharing the fate of Gaul.[2] But the long\r\ncampaigns were costly and apparently valueless. No taxes flowed into the\r\ntreasury from the poor half-subjugated savages; and the emperor Tiberius\r\ncontemptuously declared that he would leave them to fight among\r\nthemselves. Another frontier strife completed the subjugation of Spain.\r\nAnother added Britain to the Empire. Another made temporary conquest\r\nover Dacia and extended the Asian boundary. There were minor revolts in\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\nThen the Jews, roused to sudden religious frenzy and believing\r\nthemselves invincible, burst into rebellion.[3] Titus stormed their\r\ncapital and burned their Temple. But the lesson was wasted on the\r\nstubborn, fanatical race, and sixty years later they flared out again.\r\nRoman relentlessness was roused to its fullest rage, and accomplished\r\nagainst them the destruction of prophecy. Their cities were razed to the\r\nground, and the poor remnant of the race were scattered abroad. Yet,\r\napparently imperishable, refusing to be merged with other men, they\r\nremained a people though without a country. They became what they are\r\nto-day, a nation of wanderers.[4]\r\n\r\nOne other tumult, more central and in that sense more serious, intruded\r\non the Roman system. Just a century after the rise of Augustus, the\r\ntyrannies of his successor Nero became so unbearable that even his own\r\nsenate turned against him; and he was slain, without having appointed a\r\nsuccessor. The purely military character of the Empire was at once\r\nrevealed. Different armies each upheld their own general as emperor. The\r\nclaimants attacked one another in turn, and the strongest won. The\r\nturmoil lasted for only a year or so, just long enough for the distant\r\nlegions to gather around Rome; the bloodshed was nothing as compared to\r\nformer ages; the helpless senate acquiesced in each new proclamation of\r\neach successful army; and the rest of the world, scarce even jarred in\r\nits daily course, flowed on as before.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, these two hundred years were one long period of\r\npeace. It was Augustus who for the first time in centuries closed the\r\ngates of the war-god's temple in Rome. He encouraged literature, and we\r\nhave the \"Augustan\" age. He boasted that he found Rome built of bricks,\r\nand left it of marble. He and his successors did far more than that.\r\nThey constructed roads extending from end to end of their domains.\r\nCommunication became easy; a mail post was established; people began to\r\ntravel for pleasure. The nations of the world intermingled freely, and\r\ndiscovered, for the first time on earth, that they were much alike. The\r\nuniversal brotherhood of man may be not even yet fully recognized and\r\nwelcomed; but the first step toward its acknowledgment was taken under\r\nimperial Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a very solemn thought. Many earnest men have believed\r\nthat they see a divine Providence running through the whole course of\r\nhistory, and nowhere more obvious than here. They point to the careers\r\nof both Greece and Rome as being a special preparation for the coming of\r\nthe Christ. The mission of Greece, they tell us, was to arouse the mind\r\nof man, to make him capable of thought and sensitive to spiritual\r\nbeauty; that of Rome was to teach him the value of law and peace, and\r\nyet more, to draw all men together, that all might have opportunity to\r\nhear the lessons of the new faith.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that at any earlier date it would have seemed practically\r\nimpossible for a religion to spread beyond a single people. Not only was\r\ncommunication between the nations faint and intermittent, but they were\r\nso savage, so suspicious of each other, that a wanderer had to meet them\r\nweapon in hand. He must have a ship to flee to or an army at his back.\r\nNow, however, under the restraint of Roman law, strangers met and passed\r\nwithout a blow. Latin, the tongue of law, was everywhere partly known.\r\nGreek was almost equally widespread as the language of art and culture.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews, too, had done their share in the work of preparation. They\r\nhad developed the religious sense, beyond any of the Aryan peoples.\r\nTheir religion had become a part, the main part, of their daily lives.\r\nThey believed it, not with the languid logic of the Romans, not with the\r\nsensuous pleasure of the Greeks, but fiercely, fervidly, with a passion\r\nthat swept all reason to the winds.\r\n\r\nAmong them appeared the Christ, born in the days of Augustus, crucified\r\nin those of Tiberius.[5] His teaching was mainly the doctrine of love,\r\nwhich Buddha had announced five hundred years before, but which was new\r\nto the Roman world; and the promise of life beyond the grave, which many\r\nraces had more or less believed in, but which never before had been made\r\nto carry a vision of such splendor and such glory. He also advocated\r\nnon-resistance to enemies, a principle which the early Church obeyed,\r\nbut which has found small favor among the masses of later Christians.\r\n\r\nThese teachings, then, were none of them wholly unconceived before; but\r\nthey were enforced by a life so pure, a manner so earnest, as compelled\r\nrespect. Converts became many; and one of these at least took literally\r\nthe command of the Master, to proclaim the faith to all peoples of the\r\nearth. The apostle Paul, stepping beyond the narrow bounds of Judea,\r\npreached Christianity to mankind.[6]\r\n\r\nPaul was the first great missionary. The earlier faiths of Greece and\r\nRome had not sought to extend themselves, because they did not recognize\r\nthe brotherhood of man. The new faith insisted upon this, insisted on\r\nour duty to our fellows; and so under Paul's leadership every Christian\r\nbecame a missionary, teaching, uplifting the downtrodden, giving them\r\nhope, not of this world, but of an infinitely brighter one. The faith\r\nspread faster than ever world conquest had been spread before. Scarce a\r\ngeneration after the Crucifixion it had permeated the Empire, and Nero,\r\nto divert from himself the suspicion of having burned Rome, accused the\r\nChristians.[7]\r\n\r\nThis led to their first persecution. They were tortured as a punishment\r\nand to extort confession. Most of them stood nobly by their doctrine of\r\nnon-resistance, and endured heroically a martyrdom which they looked on\r\nas opening the gates of heaven.[8]\r\n\r\nTheir devotion drew to them the first serious notice of the Roman\r\nauthorities. Hitherto they had been regarded merely as a sect among the\r\nJews. But now, with reluctant admiration of their courage, there came\r\nalso a recognition of their rapid growth and a suspicion of their\r\nmotives. The Romans could not understand such devotion to a mere\r\nreligion; and they always feared lest the faith was something more, a\r\ncloak for nameless crimes, or a secret conspiracy of rebellion among\r\ntheir slaves, who would some day turn and rend them.\r\n\r\nThus while Nero's attack on the Christians was in a sense an accident,\r\nthe blind rush of a half-crazed beast, the later persecutions were often\r\ndirected by serious and well-intentioned emperors and magistrates. The\r\nRomans were far from being intolerant. They had interfered very little\r\nwith the religions of their subject races, and had, indeed, adopted more\r\nthan one foreign god into their own temples. They were quite willing\r\nthat the Christ should be worshipped. What they could not understand was\r\nthat reverence to one god should forbid reverence to another.\r\n\r\nIt was the new religion which was intolerant, which, in the passionate\r\nintensity of its faith, attacked the old gods, denied their existence,\r\nor declared them devils. When a man was summoned before a Roman court on\r\nthe charge of being a Christian, he was not, as a rule, asked to deny\r\nChrist; only, there being a general impression that his sect was evil,\r\nhe was required to prove his honest citizenship and general good\r\ncharacter by doing reverence to the Roman gods.[9]\r\n\r\nIn spite of persecution, some writers say because of it, Christianity\r\nspread. Toward the end of the first two hundred years of the Empire, it\r\nseemed about the only prosperous institution in a world which was\r\nbeginning to go badly. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the last of\r\nthe \"good\" emperors (161-180), troubles, some accidental, some inherent\r\nin the Roman system, were gathering very dark.\r\n\r\nThe curse of inaction, of wealth without liberty, of intellect without a\r\ngoal to strive toward, had long been corrupting the upper classes. Now,\r\na terrible plague swept the world from end to end, so that laborers\r\nbecame scarce, lands went untenanted, taxes unpaid. The drain of\r\nsupporting Rome's boundless extravagance, in buildings, feasts, and\r\ngladiatorial displays, began to tell upon the provinces at last. Newer\r\nand ever harsher methods had to be employed to wring money from\r\nexhausted lands. Driven by their sufferings to cling to religion as a\r\nsupport, men thought of it more seriously; and a cry went up that earth\r\nwas being punished for its neglect and insult of the ancient gods. The\r\nChristians were persecuted anew.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF DECAY\r\n\r\nThe reign of Commodus,[11] son of Marcus Aurelius, marks the beginning\r\nof a century which sank almost into anarchy. He was murdered, and his\r\nguards auctioned the Empire to the highest bidder. Once more the legions\r\nfought against each other and placed their generals upon the throne.\r\nDuring ninety-two years there were twenty-five emperors fully\r\nacknowledged, besides a far larger number of claimants who were\r\noverthrown before Rome had time to hear of and salute them. The Imperial\r\ncity was no longer mistress of the world; she was only its capital, as\r\nfeeble and helpless as the other cities, which these unstable emperors\r\nbegan at times to favor in her stead.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians also, who through all these ages were growing stronger\r\nwhile Rome grew weaker, became ever a more serious menace. The internal\r\ndisorder of the Empire left its frontiers often unguarded. The Germans\r\nplundered Gaul in the West, the Persians ravaged Asia in the East. In\r\nfact, so comparatively strong had the Persians grown that one emperor,\r\nventuring against them, was defeated and captured, and lived out his\r\nmiserable life a Persian slave. Rome could not rescue him.[12]\r\n\r\nIn the year 284 there came to the front an emperor \"of iron,\"\r\nDiocletian. He did what Augustus had done three centuries before,\r\nre-formed and recast the government of the world. The last empty\r\nceremonies of the Republic were discarded. Even the pretence of Rome's\r\nleadership was brushed aside. The Empire was divided into four\r\ndistricts, each with a capital of its own, and Diocletian selected three\r\nother generals to share its rule with him. He and his colleagues\r\nrestored the long-lost peace. They chastised the barbarians.\r\nDiocletian's reforms saved the Roman fabric from what seemed inevitable\r\nextinction, and enabled it to exist in some shape for almost another two\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nHis system of division did not, however, save the Empire from civil\r\nwars. No sooner was his restraining hand removed than his colleagues\r\nfought among themselves, until Constantine overthrew his antagonists and\r\nonce more united the entire Empire. Constantine became a Christian.[13]\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly asserted that his conversion was one of policy\r\nrather than belief; and there could be no stronger evidence of the\r\nchanged position of the new faith. Diocletian had ordered a persecution\r\nagainst it, the last and most terrible which its martyrs suffered. But\r\nall that was best and most energetic and most living in the moribund\r\nEmpire seemed to have gathered round the Church. The persecution did but\r\nemphasize its worth and influence.\r\n\r\nConstantine did not force his followers to change their beliefs with\r\nhim; but he encouraged and rewarded those who did. Under him was held\r\nthe first general council of the faith. The bishops gathered from all\r\nthe different cities of the world to compare ideas and settle more\r\nexactly the doctrines to be taught. Christianity stepped out from its\r\nhiding-place and supplanted paganism as the state religion of the\r\nEmpire.[14]\r\n\r\nAs though the unimportance of Rome were not thus sufficiently\r\nestablished, Constantine abandoned the decaying capital altogether, and\r\nbuilt himself a new city, Constantinople, at the junction of Europe and\r\nAsia. This became the centre of the changing world. Built upon the site\r\nof an old Greek colony, it was almost wholly Greek, not only in the\r\nnationality of the people who flocked to it, but in the manners of the\r\ncourt which Constantine created around him, in the art of its\r\ndecorators, in the language of its streets.[15] The Empire remained\r\nRoman only in name. The might of a thousand years had made that name a\r\nmagic spell, had sunk its restraining influence deep in the minds of\r\nmen. It was not lightly to be thrown aside.\r\n\r\nJulian, a nephew of Constantine, who after an interval succeeded him\r\nupon the throne, abandoned the adopted religion of his family, and tried\r\nto revive paganism.[16] Julian was a powerful and clever man; he seems\r\nalso to have been an honest and an earnest one. But he could not turn\r\nback the current of the world. He could not make shallow speculation\r\ntake the place of earnest faith. Altruism, the spirit of brotherhood,\r\nwhich was the animating force of Christianity, might and later somewhat\r\ndid lose itself amid the sands of selfishness; but it could not be\r\ncombated by one man with a chance preference for egotism.\r\n\r\nJulian turned to a worthier purpose. He died fighting the barbarians.\r\nThese, held back for a time by Diocletian and Constantine, were\r\nrecommencing their ravages with renewed force. And now a change comes\r\nover the character of the invasions. Hitherto they had been mere raids\r\nfor plunder; but now a huge, far-reaching, racial movement was in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nFrom the distant plains of Asia came the vanguard of the Huns, a race of\r\nhorsemen, whose swift steeds enabled them to scatter or concentrate at\r\nwill around slower-paced opponents.[17] The Huns swept over Southern\r\nRussia, then occupied by the Goths, the most civilized of the Teutonic\r\ntribes. The Goths, finding themselves helpless against the active and\r\nfierce marauders, moved onward in their turn. They crossed the Danube,\r\nnot as a raiding troop, but as an entire nation, and, half begging, half\r\ndemanding a place of refuge, they penetrated into the world of\r\ncivilization. With them came fearful stories of the Huns; but these\r\nlatter, sweeping off in another direction, failed for a while to follow\r\nup the fugitives.\r\n\r\nAs for the Goths, after they had defeated and slain one emperor, they\r\nwere given lands and temporarily subdued by Theodosius the Great, the\r\nlast ruler to hold the entire Roman domain. In 395 Theodosius, dying,\r\ndivided his possessions, quite like a hereditary monarch, between his\r\ntwo sons, both mere boys.[18] To the elder he gave Constantinople and\r\nthe East, to the younger Rome and the West. So instead of one kingdom\r\nthere were two. Partly through its own disorganization, partly from the\r\npressure of the barbarians, the Roman world had burst and fallen into\r\nhalves. These proved two very helpless and feeble halves in the hands of\r\ntheir boy rulers; and the eager Teutons, finding themselves no longer\r\nwithheld, began that remarkable series of plundering invasions by which\r\nthey overwhelmed the ancient world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[FOR THE NEXT SECTION OF THIS GENERAL SURVEY SEE VOLUME IV.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See _Destruction of Pompeii_, page 207.\r\n\r\n[2] See _Germanicus in Germany_, page 1.\r\n\r\n[3] See _Siege and Destruction of Jerusalem_, page 150.\r\n\r\n[4] See _Jews' Last Struggle for Freedom_, page 222.\r\n\r\n[5] See _The Crucifixion_, page 23.\r\n\r\n[6] See _Rise and Spread of Christianity_, page 40.\r\n\r\n[7] See _Burning of Rome under Nero_, page 108.\r\n\r\n[8] See _Persecution of the Christians under Nero_, page 134.\r\n\r\n[9] See _Martyrdom of Polycarp and Justin Martyr_, page 231.\r\n\r\n[10] See _Persecutions of Christians in Gaul_, page 246.\r\n\r\n[11] See _Beginning of Rome's Decline_, page 263.\r\n\r\n[12] See _Eventful Reign of Sapor I, King of Persia_, page 277.\r\n\r\n[13] See _Conversion of Constantine_, page 289.\r\n\r\n[14] See _First Nicene Council_, page 297.\r\n\r\n[15] See _Foundation of Constantinople_, page 320.\r\n\r\n[16] See _Julian the Apostate_, page 333.\r\n\r\n[17] See _The Huns and Their Western Migration_, page 352.\r\n\r\n[18] See _Final Division of the Roman Empire_, page 364.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANICUS IN GERMANY\r\n\r\nA.D. 13-16\r\n\r\nTACITUS\r\n\r\n     When the Germans first became known to the Romans--about B.C.\r\n     112--they showed themselves as warlike tribes along the northern\r\n     borders of Italy and in various parts of Gaul, where Cæsar\r\n     afterward had frequent encounters with them, driving them across\r\n     the Rhine into their own country. But Cæsar's knowledge of them was\r\n     confined to those tribes whose dwellings were near the Rhine,\r\n     beyond which he did not pursue them.\r\n\r\n     Augustus fortified against the Germans along the Rhine, and Drusus,\r\n     his step-son, took command against them, defeating them in several\r\n     expeditions (B.C. 13-9). As a reward, he received for himself and\r\n     his posterity the surname of Germanicus, conqueror of Germany. He\r\n     died at the age of thirty.\r\n\r\n     His son, Germanicus, born B.C. 14, was sent, in A.D. 12, to command\r\n     the forces on the Rhine. After quelling serious mutinies among his\r\n     legions he crossed the Rhine and attacked and routed some of the\r\n     German tribes who had been actively aggressive against the Romans.\r\n     During the following year he defeated other tribes, and after his\r\n     return across the Rhine he was persuaded by Segestes to aid him\r\n     against his son-in-law Arminius (the Latin name for Herman), by\r\n     whom Segestes was besieged and who, according to Tacitus, became in\r\n     the end the deliverer of Germany from the power of the Romans. But\r\n     before he was able to render this service to the German peoples he\r\n     had many hardships to endure, and at the hands of Germanicus he met\r\n     with severe reverses.\r\n\r\n     Arminius had defeated Varus, who, by reason of that disgrace,\r\n     killed himself (A.D. 10), and the despatch of Germanicus to command\r\n     the German legions was ordered in the first instance to revenge the\r\n     overthrow of his predecessor. Although it required several\r\n     campaigns, the work of Germanicus was so effectual that he withdrew\r\n     in the end, at the command of Tiberius, with advantage on his side,\r\n     and, returning to Rome, enjoyed a triumph (A.D. 17). His name is\r\n     preserved in history, alike for his military talents and services,\r\n     for his attainments in literary pursuits, and his nobleness of\r\n     mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the consulship of Drusus Cæsar and Caius Norbanus a triumph was\r\ndecreed to Germanicus; the war continuing. He was preparing with all\r\ndiligence to prosecute it in the summer, but anticipated it by a sudden\r\nirruption early in the spring into the territories of the Cattians: for\r\nhe had conceived a hope that the enemy was divided into opposite parties\r\nunder Arminius and Segestes, both remarkable for perfidy or fidelity\r\ntoward us: Arminius was the incendiary of Germany, but Segestes had\r\ngiven repeated warning of an intended revolt at other times and during\r\nthe banquet immediately preceding the insurrection, and advised Varus\r\n\"to secure him and Arminius and all the other chiefs; that the\r\nmultitude, bereft of their leaders, would not dare to attempt anything;\r\nand Varus would have an opportunity to separate the guilty from the\r\ninnocent.\" But fate decreed it, and he was slain by Arminius. Segestes,\r\nthough drawn into the war by the universal agreement of the nation in\r\nit, yet continued to disapprove of it; his detestation being augmented\r\nby motives of a domestic nature, for Arminius had carried away the\r\ndaughter of Segestes, already betrothed to another: the son-in-law\r\nhated, the fathers-in-law were at enmity; and those relations which are\r\nbonds of affection between friends fomented the animosities of enemies.\r\n\r\nGermanicus therefore handed over to Cæcina four legions, five thousand\r\nauxiliaries, and some tumultuous bands of Germans who dwelt on this side\r\nthe Rhine; he led, himself, as many legions, with double the number of\r\nallies, and erecting a fort in Mount Taunus, upon the site of one raised\r\nby his father, he pushed on in light marching order against the\r\nCattians; having left Lucius Apronius to secure the roads and the\r\nrivers, for, as the roads were dry and the rivers within bounds--events\r\nin that climate of rare occurrence--he had found no check in his rapid\r\nmarch, but on his return apprehended the violent rains and floods. He\r\nfell upon the Cattians with such surprise that all the weak (through sex\r\nor age) were instantly taken or slaughtered. The young men swam over the\r\nAdrana and endeavored to obstruct the Romans, who commenced building a\r\nbridge; then, repulsed by engines and arrows and having in vain tried\r\nterms of peace--after some had gone over to Germanicus--the rest\r\nabandoned their cantons and villages and dispersed themselves into the\r\nwoods. Mattium, the capital of the nation, he burned, ravaged the open\r\ncountry, and bent his march to the Rhine; nor durst the enemy harass his\r\nrear, which is their custom whenever they have fled, more from craft\r\nthan fear. The Cheruscans had purposed to assist the Cattians, but were\r\ndeterred by Cæcina, who moved about with his forces from place to place;\r\nand the Marsians, who dared to engage him, he checked by a victory.\r\n\r\nSoon after arrived deputies from Segestes, praying relief against the\r\nviolence of his countrymen, by whom he was besieged; Arminius having\r\nmore influence with them than himself, because he advised war, for with\r\nbarbarians the more resolute in daring a man is the more he is trusted\r\nand preferred in times of commotion. To the deputies Segestes had added\r\nSegimund, his son; but the young man hesitated from self-conviction; for\r\nthe year when Germany revolted, having been created priest at the Ubian\r\naltar, he had rent the fillets and fled to the revolters: yet, induced\r\nto rely upon Roman clemency, he undertook the execution of his father's\r\norders, was graciously received, and conducted with a guard to the\r\nGallic bank of the Rhine. Germanicus thought it worth while to march\r\nback, fought the besiegers, and rescued Segestes with a numerous train\r\nof his relations and followers, in which were ladies of illustrious\r\nrank, and among them the wife of Arminius--the same who was the daughter\r\nof Segestes--with a spirit more like that of her husband than her\r\nfather; neither subdued to tears, nor uttering the language of\r\nsupplication, but her hands folded within her bosom, and her eyes fixed\r\nupon her teeming womb. There were, likewise, carried off the spoils\r\ntaken at the slaughter of Varus and his army, and given as booty to most\r\nof those who then surrendered.\r\n\r\nAt the same time appeared Segestes himself, of vast stature, and\r\nundaunted in the consciousness of his fidelity. In this manner he spoke:\r\n\"This is not the first day that I have approved my faith and constancy\r\nto the Roman people: from the moment I was by the deified Augustus\r\npresented with the freedom of the city I have chosen my friends and\r\nenemies with reference to your interests, and that not from hatred of my\r\ncountry--for odious are traitors even to the party they prefer--but,\r\nbecause the interests of the Romans and Germans were the same, and\r\nbecause I was inclined to peace rather than war. For this reason, before\r\nVarus, the then general, I arraigned Arminius, the ravisher of my\r\ndaughter and the violator of the league with you. Put off, from the\r\nsupineness of the general, and seeing there was little protection in the\r\nlaws, I importuned him to throw into irons myself and Arminius and his\r\naccomplices: witness that night--to me I would rather it had been the\r\nlast! More to be lamented than defended are the events which followed.\r\nHowever, I cast Arminius into irons, and was myself cast into irons by\r\nhis faction: and now, on the first opportunity of conferring with you, I\r\nprefer old things to new, peace to turbulence; and at the same time I\r\nmight be a fitting mediator for the German nation, with no view of\r\nreward, but to clear myself of perfidy, if they would rather repent than\r\nbe destroyed. For the youth and inexperience of my son I implore pardon.\r\nI admit my daughter has been brought into this state by constraint; it\r\nwill be yours to consider which should preponderate with you--that she\r\nis the wife of Arminius or the daughter of Segestes.\" The answer of\r\nGermanicus was gracious: he promised indemnity to his children, and\r\nkindred, and to himself, as a retreat, a place called \"Vetera,\" in the\r\nprovince; then returned with his army, and by the direction of Tiberius\r\nreceived the title of _Imperator_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Thusnelda, wife of Arminius, taken prisoner by the\r\nsoldiers of the Roman general Germanicus\r\n\r\nPainting by H. Koenig]\r\n\r\nThe account circulated of the surrender of Segestes, and his gracious\r\nreception, affected his countrymen with hope or anguish as they were\r\nseverally prone or averse to the war. Acting upon a temper naturally\r\nviolent, the captivity of his wife and the child in her womb subjected\r\nto bondage drove Arminius to distraction: he flew about among the\r\nCheruscans, calling them to arms against Segestes, against Germanicus;\r\nnor did he refrain from invectives--\"An excellent father! a great\r\ngeneral; a valiant army, whose many hands had carried off one bit of a\r\nwoman! That before him three legions fell, three lieutenants-general;\r\nfor his method of carrying on war was not by treason nor against\r\npregnant women, but openly, against armed hosts. That the Roman\r\nstandards were still to be seen in the German groves, there suspended by\r\nhim to his country's gods. Segestes might live upon the vanquished bank;\r\nhe might get the priesthood restored to his son; but the Germans would\r\never regard the fellow as the guilty cause of their having seen between\r\nthe Elbe and Rhine rods and axes and the toga. That to other nations who\r\nknow not the Roman domination, executions and tributes were unknown;\r\nand as they had thrown them off, and as Augustus (he who was enrolled\r\nwith the gods) had retreated without accomplishing his object, and\r\nTiberius, his chosen successor, let them not dread an inexperienced\r\nstripling and a mutinous army. If they preferred their country, their\r\nparents, and their ancient possessions, to masters and new settlements,\r\nthey should follow Arminius, who led them to glory and liberty, rather\r\nthan Segestes, who conducted them to infamous servitude.\"\r\n\r\nBy these means not the Cheruscans only were roused, but the bordering\r\nnations; and Inguiomer, paternal uncle to Arminius, a man long in high\r\ncredit with the Romans, was drawn into the confederacy. Hence Germanicus\r\nbecame more alarmed, and to prevent the war falling upon him with\r\nunbroken force, sent Cæcina with forty Roman cohorts to the river\r\nAmisia, through the territories of the Bructerians, to effect a division\r\nin the army of the enemy. Pedo, the prefect, led the cavalry along the\r\nconfines of the Frisians; he himself, embarking four legions, sailed\r\nthrough the lakes; and at the aforesaid river the whole body met--foot,\r\nhorse, and fleet. The Chaucians, upon offering their assistance, were\r\ntaken into the service; but the Bructerians, setting fire to their\r\neffects and dwellings, were routed by Lucius Stertinius, despatched\r\nagainst them by Germanicus with a band lightly armed. And amid the\r\ncarnage and plunder he found the eagle of the Nineteenth legion lost in\r\nthe overthrow of Varus. The army marched next to the farthest borders of\r\nthe Bructerians, and the whole country between the rivers Amisia and\r\nLuppia was laid waste. Not far hence lay the forest of Teutoburgium, and\r\nin it the bones of Varus and the legions, by report, still unburied.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, therefore, conceived a desire to pay the last offices to the\r\nlegions and their leader; while the whole of the army present were moved\r\nto deep commiseration for their kinsmen and friends, and generally for\r\nthe calamities of war and the condition of humanity. Cæcina having been\r\nsent before to explore the gloomy recesses of the forest, and to lay\r\nbridges and causeways over the watery portions of the morasses and\r\ninsecure places in the plains, they enter the doleful scene, hideous in\r\nappearance and association. The first camp of Varus appeared in view.\r\nThe extent of ground and the measurement of the _principia_ left no\r\ndoubt that the whole was the work of three legions. After that a\r\nhalf-decayed rampart with a shallow foss, where their remains, now sadly\r\nreduced, were understood to have sunk down. In the intervening portion\r\nof the plain were whitening bones, either scattered or accumulated,\r\naccording as they had fled or had made a stand. Near them lay fragments\r\nof javelins and limbs of horses. There were also skulls fixed upon the\r\ntrunks of trees. In the adjacent groves were the savage altars, where\r\nthey had immolated the tribunes and centurions of the first rank. Those\r\nwho survived the slaughter, having escaped from captivity and the sword,\r\nrelated the sad particulars to the rest: \"Here the commanders of the\r\nlegions were slain; there we lost the eagles; here Varus had his first\r\nwound; there he gave himself another, and perished by his own unhappy\r\nhand. In that place, too, stood the tribunal whence Arminius harangued.\r\nHow many gibbets he erected for the execution of his captives; what\r\ntrenches he dug; and how, in proud scorn, he made a mock at the\r\nstandards and eagles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman army which was on the spot buried the bones of the three\r\nlegions six years after the slaughter: nor could anyone distinguish\r\nwhether he buried the remains of a stranger or of a kinsman; but all\r\nconsidered the whole as friends, as relations, with heightened\r\nresentment against the foe, at once sad and revengeful. Germanicus laid\r\nthe first sod used in raising a tomb, thus rendering a most acceptable\r\nservice to the dead, and showing that he shared the sorrows of the\r\nliving, a proceeding not liked by Tiberius; whether it were that upon\r\nevery action of Germanicus he put a malignant construction, or that he\r\nbelieved that the impression produced by the sight of the unburied slain\r\nwould dampen the ardor of the army for battle and inspire them with fear\r\nof the enemy. He also said that \"A general invested with the office of\r\naugur and the most ancient religious functions ought not to have put his\r\nhand to the ceremonies of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nArminius, retiring into pathless places, was pursued by Germanicus, who,\r\nas soon as he reached him, commanded the horse to advance and dislodge\r\nthe enemy from the post he had possessed. Arminius, having directed his\r\nmen to keep close together and draw near to the wood, wheeled suddenly\r\nabout, and to those whom he had hid in the forest gave the signal to\r\nrush out. Then the Roman horse were thrown into disorder by the assault\r\nof a new army, and the cohorts sent out to support them, broken in upon\r\nby the body of troops that fled, had augmented the consternation, and\r\nwere now being pushed into the morass--a place well known to the\r\npursuers, but dangerous to those unacquainted with it--had not\r\nGermanicus drawn out the legions in order of battle. Hence the enemy\r\nbecame terrified, our men reanimated, and both retired without advantage\r\non either side. Germanicus, soon after, returning with the army to the\r\nAmisia, reconducted the legions, as he had brought them, in the fleet;\r\npart of the horse were ordered to march along the sea-shore to the\r\nRhine. Cæcina, who led his own men, was warned that, though he was to\r\nreturn through well-known roads, yet he should with all speed pass the\r\ncauseway called the Long Bridges. It is a narrow causeway, between vast\r\nmarshes, and formerly raised by Lucius Domitius. The rest of the country\r\nis of a moist nature, either tough and sticky from a heavy kind of clay\r\nor dangerous from the streams which intersect it. Round about are woods\r\nwhich rise gently from the plain, which at that time were filled with\r\nsoldiers by Arminius, who, by short cuts and quick marching, had arrived\r\nthere before our men, who were loaded with arms and baggage. Cæcina, who\r\nwas perplexed how at once to repair the causeway decayed by time and to\r\nrepulse the foe, resolved to encamp in the place, that while some were\r\nemployed in the work, others might begin the fight.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians, having made a vigorous effort to break through the\r\noutposts and fall upon those employed in the works, harass the troops,\r\nmarch round them, and throw themselves in their way. A mingled shout\r\narose from the workmen and the combatants; all things equally combined\r\nto distress the Romans--the place deep with ooze, sinking under those\r\nwho stood, slippery to such as advanced; their bodies were encumbered\r\nwith their coats of mail, nor could they hurl their javelins in the\r\nmidst of water. The Cheruscans, on the contrary, were inured to\r\nencounters in the bogs: their persons tall; their spears long, so as to\r\nwound at a distance. At last the legions, already giving way, were saved\r\nfrom defeat by the approach of night; the Germans not feeling fatigue on\r\naccount of their success, without refreshing themselves with sleep, even\r\nthen diverted all the courses of the springs which rise in the\r\nneighboring mountains into the plains; thus the ground being flooded,\r\nand the work, as far as they had carried it, overturned, the soldiers\r\nhad all to do over again. Cæcina, who had served forty years, either\r\nunder others or in command, was experienced in the vicissitudes of war,\r\nprosperous or disastrous, and thence undaunted. Weighing, therefore, all\r\nprobabilities, he could devise no other expedient than that of\r\nrestraining the enemy to the wood until he had sent forward all the\r\nwounded and baggage; for between the mountains and the marshes there\r\nstretched a plain large enough to admit a small army. To this purpose\r\nthe legions selected were: The Fifth, for the right wing, and\r\nTwenty-first, for the left; the soldiers of the First legion to lead the\r\nvan of the Twentieth to oppose the pursuers.\r\n\r\nIt was a restless night to both armies, but from different causes. The\r\nbarbarians, with festive carousals, songs of triumph, or horrid cries,\r\nfilled the vales below and echoing wood. Among the Romans were feeble\r\nfires, low broken murmurs; they leaned, drooping here and there, against\r\nthe pales, or wandered about the tents, more like men wanting sleep than\r\nquite awake. The general, too, was alarmed by direful visions during his\r\nsleep; he thought he heard, and saw, Quintilius Varus, rising out of the\r\nmarsh, all besmeared with blood, stretching forth his hand and calling\r\nupon him, but that he rejected the call, and pushed back his hand as he\r\nheld it toward him. At break of day the legions, posted on the wings,\r\nwhether from perverseness or fear, deserted their post and took sudden\r\npossession of a field beyond the bogs; neither did Arminius fall\r\nstraight upon them, though they lay open to assault; but when the\r\nbaggage was set fast in the mire and ditches, the soldiers about it in\r\ndisorder, the order of the standards confounded, and--as usual at such a\r\ntime--each man acting hastily for himself, when the ears are slow to\r\ncatch the word of command, he then commanded his Germans to charge,\r\nexclaiming vehemently, \"Behold! Varus and his legions again subdued by\r\nthe same fate!\" Thus he cried, and instantly, with a select body, broke\r\nthrough the mass, and chiefly against the horse directed his weapons.\r\nFloundering in their own blood and the slippery soil of the marsh, they\r\nthrew their riders, overturned all they met, and trampled on those that\r\nwere on the ground. The greatest distress was around the eagles, which\r\ncould neither be carried against a shower of darts nor be planted in the\r\nslimy ground. Cæcina, while he sustained the fight, had his horse shot\r\nand, having fallen, would have been overpowered had not the First legion\r\ncome up to succor him. Our relief came from the greediness of the enemy,\r\nwho ceased slaying, to seize the spoil. And the legions, as the day\r\nclosed in, by great exertion got into the open and firm ground. Nor was\r\nthis the end of their miseries; a palisade was to be raised, an\r\nintrenchment digged; their instruments, too, for throwing up and\r\ncarrying earth, and their tools for cutting turf, were almost all lost.\r\nNo tents for the soldiers; no remedies for the wounded. While dividing\r\namong them their food, defiled with mire or blood, they lamented that\r\nmournful night; they lamented the approaching day, to so many thousand\r\nmen the last.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a horse which had broken his fastenings and, as he\r\nstrayed about, become frightened by a noise, had run over some that were\r\nin his way. This raised such a consternation in the camp--from a\r\npersuasion that the Germans had forced an entrance--that all rushed to\r\nthe gates, especially to the postern,[19] as the farthest from the foe\r\nand safer for flight. Cæcina having ascertained that there was no cause\r\nfor alarm, but unable to stop them or hold them back, either by his\r\nauthority or prayers or even by force, prostrated himself on the\r\nthreshold of the gate; and thus at length by appealing to their\r\nhumanity--for if they proceeded it must be over the body of the\r\ngeneral--he blocked the passage, and the tribunes and centurions\r\nsatisfied them the while that it was a false alarm.\r\n\r\nThen assembling them in the court, and desiring them to hear him with\r\nsilence, he warned them of their difficulties, and their duty under\r\nthem: \"That their sole hope of safety was in their valor, but that must\r\nbe guided by counsel; that they must keep close within their camp till\r\nthe enemy, in hopes of taking it by storm, came up nearer to them; then\r\nmake a sudden sally on every side, that by this sally they might make\r\ngood their way to the Rhine; but if they fled, more forests, deeper\r\nmarshes, and the fierce attack of the foe still remained to them; but\r\nthat if they conquered, honor and renown awaited them.\" He reminded them\r\nof all that was dear to them at home, and the rewards to be obtained in\r\nthe camp, but suppressed all mention of defeat. He next distributed\r\nhorses, first his own, then those of the tribunes and leaders of the\r\nlegions, to all the bravest warriors, without any flattery, that these\r\nfirst, and afterward the infantry, might charge the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were in no less agitation from hope, eagerness, and the\r\nopposite counsels of their leaders. Arminius proposed \"To let them march\r\nout, and to beset them again in their way when they got into marshes and\r\ndifficult passes.\" Inguiomer advised measures more resolute and\r\nacceptable to barbarians--\"To invest the camp; it would be quickly\r\ncaptured; there would be more captives, and the plunder uninjured.\" As\r\nsoon therefore as it was light, they level the ditch, cast hurdles into\r\nit, attempt to scale the palisade, there being but few men on the\r\nrampart, and those who were, standing as if paralyzed by fear. But when\r\nthey were hampered in the fortifications, the signal was given to the\r\ncohorts; the cornets and trumpets sounded at once, and instantly,\r\nshouting and charging, they poured down upon their rear, telling them\r\ntauntingly \"that there were no thickets, no marshes, but equal chances\r\nin a fair field.\" The enemy, expecting an easy conquest, and that the\r\nRomans were few and half-armed, were overpowered with the sounds of\r\ntrumpets and glitter of arms, which were then magnified in proportion as\r\nthey were unexpected; and they fell like men who, as they are void of\r\nmoderation in prosperity, are also destitute of conduct in distress.\r\nArminius fled from the fight unhurt, Inguiomer severely wounded. The men\r\nwere slaughtered as long as day and rage lasted. At length, at night,\r\nthe legions returned, and though distressed by the same want of\r\nprovisions and more wounds, yet in victory they found all\r\nthings--health, vigor, and abundance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a report had spread that an army was cut off, and a body of\r\nGermans on full march to invade Gaul; so that, under the terror of this\r\nnews, there were those whose cowardice would have emboldened them to\r\ndemolish the bridge upon the Rhine, had not Agrippina forbidden the\r\ninfamous attempt. This high-minded woman took upon herself all the\r\nduties of a general, and distributed to the soldiers, gratuitously,\r\nmedicines and clothes, according as anyone was in want or wounded. Caius\r\nPlinius, the writer of the German wars, relates that she stood at the\r\nhead of the bridge as the legions returned, and bestowed on them thanks\r\nand praises; a behavior which sunk deep into the heart of Tiberius, for\r\nthese attentions he thought were not disinterested; nor was it against\r\nforeigners she sought to win the army; for nothing was now left the\r\ngenerals to do, when a woman paid her visits of inspection to the\r\ncompanies, attended the standards, and presumed to distribute largesses;\r\nas if before she had shown but small tokens of ambitious designs in\r\ncarrying her child (the son of the general) in a soldier's uniform\r\nabout the camp and desiring that he be styled Cæsar Caligula.\r\nAlready Agrippina was in greater credit with the army than the\r\nlieutenants-general, or even the generals--a woman had suppressed a\r\nsedition which the authority of the Emperor was not able to restrain.\r\nThese jealousies were inflamed and ministered to by Sejanus, who was\r\nwell acquainted with the temper of Tiberius, and supplied him with\r\nmaterials for hatred, prospectively, that he might treasure them up in\r\nhis heart and draw them out augmented in bitterness.\r\n\r\nGermanicus handed over the Second and Fourteenth of the legions, which\r\nhe had brought in ships, to Publius Vitellius to conduct them by land,\r\nthat his fleet, thus lightened, might sail on the shoally sea, or run\r\naground with safety when the tide ebbed. Vitellius at first marched\r\nwithout interruption while the ground was dry or the tide flowed within\r\nbounds. Presently the ocean beginning to swell by the action of the\r\nnorthwest wind upon it, and also by the influence of the equinoxial\r\nconstellation--at which season the sea swells most--the troops were\r\nmiserably harassed and driven about. The lands were completely\r\ninundated; the sea, the shore, the fields, had one uniform face: no\r\ndistinction of depths from shallows, of firm from treacherous footing;\r\nthey were overturned by billows, absorbed by the eddies; beasts of\r\nburden, baggage, and dead bodies floated among them and came in contact\r\nwith them. The several companies were mixed at random, wading now breast\r\nhigh, now up to their chin; sometimes, the ground failing them, they\r\nfell, some never more to rise. Their cries and mutual encouragements\r\navailed them nothing; the noise of the water drowning them; no\r\ndifference between the coward and the brave, the wise and the foolish;\r\nnone between circumspection and hap-hazard, but all were involved in the\r\nsweeping torrent. Vitellius at length, having by great exertion gained\r\nthe higher ground, withdrew the legions thither, where they passed the\r\nnight without fire and without food, many of them naked or lamed, not\r\nless miserable than men enclosed by an enemy--for even such had the\r\nresource of an honorable death, while these must perish ingloriously.\r\nDaylight restored the land, and they marched to the river Unsingis,\r\nwhither Germanicus had gone with the fleet. The legions were then\r\nembarked, while rumor reported that they were sunk; nor was their escape\r\nbelieved until Germanicus and the army were seen to return.\r\n\r\nStertinius, who had been sent before to receive the submission of\r\nSigimer, the brother of Segestes, had now brought him and his son to the\r\ncity of the Ubians; both were pardoned, the father promptly, the son\r\nwith more hesitation, because he was said to have insulted the corpse of\r\nVarus. For the rest, Spain, Italy, and the Gauls vied in supplying the\r\nlosses of the army, offering arms, horses, money, whatever each had at\r\nhand. Germanicus, applauding their zeal, accepted only the horses and\r\narms for the war; with his own money he assisted the soldiers; and, to\r\nsoften by kindness also the memory of the late disaster, he visited the\r\nwounded, extolled the exploits of individuals, and, looking at their\r\nwounds, with hopes encouraged some, with a sense of glory animated\r\nothers, and by affability and attention confirmed them all in devotion\r\nto himself and to his service. Between the Romans and the Cheruscans\r\nflowed the river Visurgis. On its bank stood Arminius, with the other\r\nchiefs, inquiring whether Germanicus was come; and being answered that\r\nhe was there, he prayed leave to speak with his brother. This brother of\r\nhis was in the army, his name Flavius, remarkable for his fidelity, and\r\nfor the loss of an eye under Tiberius. Permission was then granted.\r\nFlavius, advancing, was saluted by Arminius, who having removed his own\r\nattendants, requested that the archers ranged upon our bank might\r\nretire. When they were gone--\"How came you,\" he asked his brother, \"by\r\nthat deformity in your face?\" The brother having informed him where and\r\nin what fight, he desired to know \"what reward he had received\"? Flavius\r\nanswered, \"Increase of pay, the chain, the crown, and other military\r\ngifts\"; which Arminius treated with derision, as the vile wages of\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nAfter that they began in different strains. Flavius urged \"the Roman\r\ngreatness, the power of Cæsar, the severe punishment inflicted on the\r\nvanquished; and the clemency vouchsafed to those who submitted; that\r\nneither the wife nor son of Arminius was treated as a captive.\" Arminius\r\nto this opposed \"the claims of country, their hereditary liberty, the\r\ndomestic gods of Germany; their mother, who joined in his prayer that he\r\nwould not prefer the character of a deserter, and a betrayer of his\r\nkinsmen and connections, in short, of his race, to that of their\r\ngeneral.\" From this they gradually proceeded to invectives; nor would\r\nthe interposition of the river have restrained them from an encounter,\r\nhad not Stertinius, running to him, held back Flavius, full of rage and\r\ncalling for his arms and his horse. On the opposite side was seen\r\nArminius, menacing furiously and proclaiming battle. For most of what he\r\nsaid in this dialogue was in Latin, having, as the general of his\r\ncountrymen, served in the Roman camp.\r\n\r\nNext day the German army stood in order of battle beyond the Visurgis.\r\nGermanicus, who thought it became not a general to endanger the legions\r\nin the passage without bridges and guards, made the horse ford over.\r\nThey were led by Stertinius and Æmilius, one of the principal\r\ncenturions, who entered the river at distant places to divide the\r\nattention of the foe. Cariovalda, captain of the Batavians, dashed\r\nthrough where the stream was most rapid, and was by the Cheruscans--who\r\nfeigned flight--drawn into a plain surrounded by woods. Then starting up\r\nat once, and pouring upon him on every side, they overthrew those who\r\nresisted, and pressed after those who gave way, who at length, forming\r\nthemselves into a circle, were assailed by some hand-to-hand, by others\r\nwere annoyed by missiles. Cariovalda, having long sustained the fury of\r\nthe enemy, exhorted his men to break through the assailing bands in a\r\nsolid body; he himself charged into the thickest, and fell under a\r\nshower of darts--his horse also being killed--and many nobles fell\r\naround him. The rest were saved by their own bravery, or by the cavalry\r\nunder Stertinius and Æmilius, which came up to their assistance.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, having passed the Visurgis, learned from a deserter that\r\nArminius had marked out the place of battle; that more tribes also had\r\njoined him at a wood sacred to Hercules, and would attempt to storm our\r\ncamp by night. The deserter was believed, the enemy's fires were in\r\nview, and the scouts, having advanced toward them, reported that they\r\nheard the neighing of horses and the murmur of a mighty and tumultuous\r\nhost. Being thus upon the eve of a decisive battle, Germanicus thought\r\nit behooved him to learn the sentiments of the soldiers, and deliberated\r\nwith himself how to get at the truth; \"the reports of the tribunes and\r\ncenturions were oftener agreeable than true; the freedmen had servile\r\nspirits; friends were apt to flatter; if an assembly were called, there,\r\ntoo, the counsel proposed by a few was carried by the clamorous plaudits\r\nof the rest. The minds of soldiers could, then, only be thoroughly known\r\nwhen, by themselves, free from all restraint, and over their mess, they\r\ngave unreserved utterance to their hopes and fears.\"\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, taking the path leading by the place of divination,[20] he\r\nwent out with a single attendant, a deerskin covering his shoulders,[21]\r\nand proceeding by a secret way where there were no sentinels, entered\r\nthe avenues of the camp, stationed himself near the tents, and eagerly\r\nlistened to what was said of himself, while one magnified the imperial\r\nbirth of his general, another his graceful person, very many his\r\nfirmness, condescension, and the evenness of his temper, whether\r\nseriously occupied or in moments of relaxation; and they confessed that\r\ntheir sense of his merits should be shown in battle, protesting at the\r\nsame time that those traitors and violators of peace should be made a\r\nsacrifice to vengeance and to fame. In the mean time one of the enemy\r\nwho understood Latin rode up to the palisades, and with a loud voice\r\noffered, in the name of Arminius, to every deserter a wife and land,\r\nand, as long as the war lasted, a hundred sesterces a day. This affront\r\nkindled the wrath of the legions. \"Let day come,\" they cried, \"battle\r\nshould be given, the soldiers would themselves take the lands of the\r\nGermans, lead away wives by right of conquest; they, however, welcomed\r\nthe omen, and considered the wealth and women of the enemy their\r\ndestined prey.\" About the third watch[22] an attempt was made upon the\r\ncamp, but not a dart was discharged, as they found the cohorts planted\r\nthick upon the works, and nothing neglected that was necessary for a\r\nvigorous defence.\r\n\r\nGermanicus had the same night a cheering dream: he thought he\r\nsacrificed, and, in place of his own robe besmeared with the blood of\r\nthe victim, received one fairer from the hands of his grandmother\r\nAugusta. Elated by the omen, and the auspices being favorable, he called\r\nan assembly, and laid before them what in his judgment seemed likely to\r\nbe advantageous and suitable for the impending battle. He said \"that to\r\nthe Roman soldiers not only plains, but, with due circumspection, even\r\nwoods and forests were convenient. The huge targets, the enormous spears\r\nof the barbarians, could never be wielded among trunks of trees and\r\nthickets of underwood shooting up from the ground like Roman swords and\r\njavelins, and armor fitting the body; that they should reiterate their\r\nblows, and aim at the face with their swords. The Germans had neither\r\nhelmet nor coat of mail; their bucklers were not even strengthened with\r\nleather or iron, but mere contextures of twigs, and boards of no\r\nsubstance flourished over with paint; their first rank was armed with\r\npikes, in some sort, the rest had only stakes burned at the end, or\r\nshort darts. And now to come to their persons, as they were terrific to\r\nsight, and vigorous enough for a brief effort, so they were utterly\r\nimpatient of wounds; unaffected with shame for misconduct, and destitute\r\nof respect for their generals. They would quit their posts or run away\r\nbefore the enemy; cowards in adversity, in prosperity despisers of all\r\ndivine, of all human laws; if weary of marches and sea voyages, they\r\nwished an end of these things, by this battle it was presented to them.\r\nThe Elbe was now nearer than the Rhine; there was nothing to subdue\r\nbeyond this; they had only to place him, crowned with victory, in the\r\nsame country which had witnessed the triumphs of his father and uncle,\r\nin whose footsteps he was treading.\" The ardor of the soldiers was\r\nkindled by this speech of the general, and the signal for the onset was\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nNeither did Arminius or the other chiefs neglect solemnly to assure\r\ntheir several bands that \"these were Romans; the most desperate\r\nfugitives of the Varian army, who, to avoid the hardships of war, had\r\nput on the character of rebels; who, without any hope of success, were\r\nagain braving the angry gods, and exposing to their exasperated foes,\r\nsome of them backs burdened with wounds, others limbs enfeebled with the\r\neffects of storms and tempests. Their motive for having recourse to a\r\nfleet and the pathless regions of the ocean was that no one might oppose\r\nthem as they approached or pursue them when repulsed; but when they\r\nengaged hand-to-hand, vain would be the help of winds and oars after a\r\ndefeat. The Germans needed only remember their rapine, cruelty, and\r\npride; was any other course left them than to maintain their liberty,\r\nand, if they could not do that, to die before they took a yoke upon\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy thus inflamed, and calling for battle, were led into a plain\r\ncalled Idistavisus. It lies between the Visurgis and the hills, and\r\nwinds irregularly along, as it is encroached upon by the projecting\r\nbases of the mountains or enlarged by the receding banks of the river.\r\nAt their rear rose a majestic forest, the branches of the trees shooting\r\nup into the air, but the ground clear between their trunks. The army of\r\nbarbarians occupied the plain and the entrances of the forest; the\r\nCheruscans alone sat in ambush upon the mountain, in order to pour down\r\nfrom thence upon the Romans when engaged in the fight. Our army marched\r\nthus: the auxiliary Gauls and Germans in front, after them the foot\r\narchers, next four legions, and then Germanicus with two prætorian\r\ncohorts and the choice of the cavalry; then four legions more, and the\r\nlight foot with the mounted archers, and the other cohorts of the\r\nallies; the men were on the alert and in readiness, so that the order of\r\nmarch might form the order of battle when they halted.\r\n\r\nAs the bands of Cheruscans who had impatiently rushed forward were now\r\nperceived, Germanicus commanded the most efficient of his horse to\r\ncharge them in the flank, and Stertinius with the rest to wheel round to\r\nattack them in the rear, and promised to be ready to assist them at the\r\nproper moment. Meanwhile an omen of happiest import appeared; eight\r\neagles, seen to fly toward the wood and to enter it, caught the eye of\r\nthe general. \"Advance!\" he cried, \"follow the Roman birds; follow the\r\ntutelar deities of the legions!\"\r\n\r\nAt once the foot charged, and the cavalry sent forward attacked their\r\nflank and rear, and, strange to relate, the two divisions of their army\r\nfled opposite ways; that in the wood ran to the plain, that in the plain\r\nrushed into the wood. The Cheruscans between both were driven from the\r\nhills; among them Arminius formed a conspicuous object, while with his\r\nhand, his voice, and the exhibition of his wounds he strove to sustain\r\nthe fight. He had vigorously assaulted the archers, and would have\r\nbroken through them had not the cohorts of the Rhætians, the\r\nVindelicians, and the Gauls advanced to oppose him. However, by his own\r\npersonal effort and the impetus of his horse he made good his passage,\r\nhis face besmeared with his own blood to avoid being known. Some have\r\nrelated that the Chaucians, who were among the Roman auxiliaries, knew\r\nhim and let him go; the same bravery or stratagem procured Inguiomer his\r\nescape; the rest were slain on all hands; great numbers attempting to\r\nswim the Visurgis perished either by the darts showered after them or\r\nthe violence of the current, or, if they escaped these, they were\r\noverwhelmed by the weight of the rushing crowd and the banks which fell\r\nupon them. Some, seeking an ignominious refuge, climbed to the tops of\r\ntrees, and, concealing themselves among the branches, were shot in\r\nsport by the archers, who were brought up for the purpose; others were\r\ndashed against the ground as the trees were felled. This was a great\r\nvictory, and withal achieved without loss on our side.\r\n\r\nThis slaughter of the foe, from the fifth hour[23] of the day until\r\nnight, filled the country for ten miles with carcasses and arms. Among\r\nthe spoils, chains were found, which, sure of conquering, they had\r\nbrought to bind the Roman captives. The soldiers saluted Tiberius as\r\n\"Imperator\"[24] upon the field of battle, and, raising a mount, placed\r\nupon it, after the manner of trophies, the German arms, with the names\r\nof all the vanquished nations inscribed below.\r\n\r\nThis sight filled the Germans with more anguish and rage than all their\r\nwounds, afflictions, and overthrows. They, who were just now prepared to\r\nabandon their dwellings and retire beyond the Elbe, meditate war and\r\ngrasp their arms; people, nobles, youth, aged, all rush suddenly upon\r\nthe Roman army in its march and disorder it. Lastly, they chose a\r\nposition shut in by a river and a forest, the inner space being a\r\nconfined and humid plain; the forest, too, surrounded with a deep marsh,\r\nexcept that the Angrivarii had elevated one side by erecting a broad\r\nmound to part them and the Cheruscans. Here their foot were posted;\r\ntheir horse were concealed among the neighboring groves, that they might\r\nbe on the rear of the legions when they had entered the wood.\r\n\r\nNothing of all this was a secret to Germanicus. He knew their counsels,\r\ntheir stations, their overt movements and their concealed measures; and\r\nturned their subtlety to the destruction of themselves. To Seius Tubero,\r\nhis lieutenant, he committed the horse and the plain; the infantry he\r\nso formed that part might pass the level approaches into the wood, and\r\nthe rest force their way up the rampart; whatever was arduous he\r\nreserved to himself, the rest he committed to his lieutenants. Those who\r\nhad the even ground to traverse easily forced an entrance; but they who\r\nwere to storm the rampart were battered from above, as if they had been\r\nassaulting a wall. The general perceived the inequality of this close\r\nencounter, and, drawing off the legions a small distance, ordered the\r\nslingers and engineers to discharge their missiles and dislodge the\r\nenemy. Immediately darts were poured from the engines, and the defenders\r\nof the barrier, the more conspicuous they were, with the more wounds\r\nwere beaten down. Germanicus, having taken the rampart, first forced his\r\nway at the head of the prætorian cohorts into the wood, and there\r\nfought, foot-to-foot. Behind the enemy was the morass, behind the Romans\r\nthe mountains or the river; no room for either to retreat, no hope but\r\nin valor, no safety but in victory.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were not inferior in courage, but in their method of\r\nfighting and the nature of their arms; as their vast numbers, hampered\r\nin narrow places, could not push forward, nor recover their immense\r\nspears, nor practise their usual assaults and rapid motions, being\r\ncompelled by their crowded condition to adopt a stationary manner of\r\nfighting. On the contrary, our soldiers, with shields fitted to their\r\nbreasts, and their hands firmly grasping their sword hilts, could gash\r\nthe brawny limbs and naked faces of the barbarians, and open themselves\r\na way with havoc to the enemy. Besides, the activity of Arminius now\r\nfailed him, being either exhausted by a succession of disasters or\r\ndisabled by his recent wound. Nay, Inguiomer, too, who flew from place\r\nto place throughout the battle, was abandoned by fortune rather than\r\ncourage. Germanicus, to be the easier known, pulled off his helmet, and\r\nexhorted his men \"to prosecute the slaughter; they wanted no captives,\"\r\nhe said; \"the extermination of the people alone would put an end to the\r\nwar!\" It was now late in the day and he drew off a legion to pitch a\r\ncamp; the rest glutted themselves till night with the blood of the foe;\r\nthe horse fought with doubtful success.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, having in a public harangue praised his victorious troops,\r\nraised a pile of arms with this proud inscription: \"That the army of\r\nTiberius Cæsar, having subdued the nations between the Rhine and the\r\nElbe, had consecrated these memorials to Mars, to Jupiter, and to\r\nAugustus.\" Of himself he made no mention; either fearful of provoking\r\nenvy or that he felt satisfied with the consciousness of his own merit.\r\nHe next charged Stertinius with the war among the Angrivarians, and he\r\nwould have proceeded had they not made haste to submit; approaching as\r\nsupplicants, and making a full confession of their guilt, they received\r\npardon without reserve.\r\n\r\nThe summer being now far advanced, some of the legions were sent back\r\ninto winter quarters by land; the greater part Cæsar put on board the\r\nfleet and conveyed them along the Amisia to the ocean. The sea, at first\r\nserene, resounded only with the oars of a thousand ships or their\r\nimpulse when under sail; but presently a shower of hail poured down from\r\na black mass of clouds; at the same time storms raging on all sides in\r\nevery variety, the billows rolling now here, now there, obstructed the\r\nview and made it impossible to manage the ships. The soldiers, too,\r\nunaccustomed to the perils of the sea, in their alarm embarrassed the\r\nmariners, or, helping them awkwardly, rendered unavailing the services\r\nof the skilful. After this, the whole expanse of air and sea was swept\r\nby a southwest wind, which, deriving strength from the mountainous\r\nregions of Germany, its deep rivers, and boundless tract of clouded\r\natmosphere, and rendered still harsher by the rigor of the neighboring\r\nnorth, tore away the ships, scattered and drove them into the open\r\nocean, or upon islands, dangerous from precipitous rocks or the hidden\r\nsand-banks which beset them. Having got a little clear of these (but\r\nwith great difficulty), the tide turned, and, flowing in the same\r\ndirection as that in which the wind blew, they were unable to ride at\r\nanchor or bale out the water that broke in upon them. Horses, beasts of\r\nburden, baggage, even arms, were thrown overboard to lighten the holds\r\nof the vessels, which took in water at their sides and from the waves\r\nrunning over them. Around them were either shores inhabited by enemies\r\nor a sea so vast and unfathomable as to be supposed to be the limit of\r\nthe world and unbounded by any land. Part of the fleet was swallowed\r\nup; many ships were driven upon remote islands where, without a trace of\r\ncivilized humanity, the men perished through famine, or were kept alive\r\nby the carcasses of horses that were dashed upon the same shore. The\r\ngalley of Germanicus alone reached the coast of the Chaucians[25] where,\r\nduring the whole period of his stay, both day and night, amid the rocks\r\nand prominences of the shore, he reproached himself as being the author\r\nof such overwhelming destruction, and was hardly restrained by his\r\nfriends from destroying himself in the sea. At last, with the returning\r\ntide and favoring gale, the shattered ships returned--almost all\r\ndestitute of oars, or with garments spread for sails, and some towed by\r\nthose which were less disabled. He repaired them hastily, and despatched\r\nthem to search the islands. By this diligence the greater part were\r\nrecovered; many were by the Angrivarians (our new subjects) redeemed\r\nfrom their more inland neighbors and restored; and some, driven into\r\nGreat Britain, were sent back by the petty kings. Each according to the\r\nremoteness of the region he had returned from recounted the wonders he\r\nhad witnessed: \"the impetuosity of whirlwinds; strange birds; sea\r\nmonsters of ambiguous form between man and beast\"--things either seen or\r\nfancied from the effects of fear.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of this wreck animated the Germans with hopes of renewing\r\nthe war, which Germanicus, perceiving, resolved to check. He commanded\r\nCaius Silius, with thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse, to\r\nmarch into the country of the Cattians; he himself, with a greater\r\nforce, invaded the Marsians, where he learned from Malovendus, their\r\ngeneral--lately taken into our subjection--that the eagle of one of\r\nVarus' legions was hidden underground in a neighboring grove kept by a\r\nslender guard. Instantly two parties were despatched: one to face the\r\nenemy and draw him from his position, the other to march around upon the\r\nrear and open the ground. Success attended both. Hence Germanicus,\r\nadvancing toward the interior with greater alacrity, laid waste the\r\ncountry and destroyed the effects of the late disaster. The foe,\r\nwherever they engaged, were instantly defeated; nor (as was learned from\r\nthe prisoners) were they ever more dismayed. \"The Romans,\" they\r\nexclaimed, \"are invincible; no calamities can subdue them; they have\r\nwrecked their fleet, their arms are lost, our shores are covered with\r\nthe bodies of their horses and men; and yet they have invaded us with\r\ntheir usual spirit, with the same firmness, and as if their numbers were\r\nincreased.\"\r\n\r\nThe army was thence led back into winter quarters, full of joy to have\r\nbalanced, by this prosperous expedition, their misfortunes at sea; and\r\nby the bounty of Germanicus their happiness was increased; since to each\r\nsufferer he paid as much as he declared he had lost; neither was it\r\ndoubted but that the enemy was tottering and concerting measures for\r\nobtaining peace, and that the next summer would terminate the war.\r\nTiberius, by frequent letters, pressed him \"to come home to the triumph\r\ndecreed him.\" He urged also that he had experienced enough of events and\r\ncasualties; he had indeed fought great and successful battles, but he\r\nmust likewise remember his losses and calamities, which (however, owing\r\nto wind and waves, and no fault of the general) were yet great and\r\ngrievous. He himself had been sent nine times into Germany by Augustus,\r\nand effected much more by policy than arms. It was thus he had brought\r\nthe Sygambrians into subjection, thus the Suevians, thus King Maroboduus\r\nhad been obliged to submit to terms. The Cheruscans, too, and the other\r\nhostile nations--now the Roman honor was vindicated--might be left to\r\npursue their own intestine feuds. Germanicus besought one year to\r\naccomplish his conquest, but Tiberius assailed his modesty with fresh\r\nimportunity, by offering him another consulship, the duties of which\r\nwould require his presence; he added \"that if the war were still to be\r\nprosecuted, he should leave materials for the fame of his brother,\r\nDrusus, who, as there then remained no other enemy, could acquire the\r\ntitle of _Imperator_, and earn the privilege of presenting the laurel in\r\nGermany alone.\" Germanicus persisted no longer; though he knew that this\r\nwas all hypocrisy, and that through envy he was torn away from a ripened\r\nharvest of glory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] There were four gates to a Roman camp. Livy says so in express\r\nterms: \"_Ad quatuor portas exercitum instruxit, ut, signo dato, ex\r\nomnibus portubus eruptionem facerent._\" The several gates were the\r\n_prætorian_; the gate opposite to it, at the extremity of the camp,\r\ncalled the _decuman_; and two others, called the _right_ and _left\r\nprincipals_, because they stood on the right and left sides of the camp,\r\nfronting the street called _Principia_.\r\n\r\n[20] In the camp a place was set apart for taking the auspices, on the\r\nright of the general's tent.\r\n\r\n[21] He assumed this disguise in order to appear like a German soldier.\r\n\r\n[22] The Romans divided the night into four watches. Each watch was on\r\nduty three hours, and then relieved by the next in turn. The third watch\r\nbegan about the modern twelve at night.\r\n\r\n[23] It appears that the battle was fought in July or the beginning of\r\nAugust, _adulta jam æstate_. If so, the _fifth_ hour nearly agrees with\r\nour nine in the morning.\r\n\r\n[24] In the time of the republic, the title of Imperator was given by\r\nthe soldiers in the field of battle to the commander-in-chief. The\r\ncustom ceased under Augustus, who annexed the title to the imperial\r\ndignity, the prince being then generalissimo of all the armies of the\r\nempire. The name of Imperator, it is true, was afterward given to the\r\ngeneral who gained a victory; but that was not done without the special\r\npermission of the prince. The same rule was observed under the following\r\nemperors; and accordingly we find that Tiberius was saluted Imperator;\r\nbut the soldiers did not presume to do that honor to Germanicus.\r\n\r\n[25] The mouth of the Visurgis, or the Weser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUCIFIXION\r\n\r\nA.D. 30[26]\r\n\r\nFREDERIC WILLIAM FARRAR\r\n\r\n     The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ took place on Friday of the\r\n     Passover week of the Jews, in the year A.D. 30. This day is known\r\n     and now generally observed by Christians as Good Friday.\r\n     Crucifixion, as a means of inflicting death in the most cruel,\r\n     lingering, and shameful way, was used by many nations of antiquity.\r\n     The Jews never executed their criminals in this way, but the Greeks\r\n     and Romans made the cross the instrument of death to malefactors.\r\n     The cross was in the shape either of the letter T or the letter X,\r\n     or was in the form familiar in such paintings of the Crucifixion as\r\n     the well-known representation of Rubens. It was the usual custom to\r\n     compel the criminal to carry his own cross to the place of\r\n     execution. The cross was then set up and the criminal was usually\r\n     tied to it by the hands and feet and left to perish of hunger and\r\n     thirst. Sometimes he was given a narcotic drink to stupefy him. In\r\n     the case of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the victim was fastened\r\n     to the cross by nails driven through his hands and feet.\r\n\r\n     As Dr. Judson Titsworth has plainly pointed out, the men who were\r\n     crucified with Jesus Christ were not thieves, but robbers (this is\r\n     the term also used below by Farrar), or perhaps Jewish patriots, to\r\n     the Romans political rebels and outlaws. They would then be classed\r\n     with Jesus under the accusation that they were not loyal to the\r\n     sovereignty of the Roman Emperor. During the procuratorship of\r\n     Pontius Pilate there was a widely prevailing spirit of sedition and\r\n     revolt among the Jews, and many rebels were sentenced to\r\n     crucifixion. Such a rebel was the robber Barabbas, whom Pilate\r\n     wished to substitute for Jesus as the victim of popular fury. The\r\n     \"robber\" episode of the Crucifixion is treated by Farrar with a\r\n     picturesque effect which heightens the vivid coloring in his\r\n     account of the supreme event that marks \"the central point of the\r\n     world's history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUtterly brutal and revolting as was the punishment of crucifixion, which\r\nhas now for fifteen hundred years been abolished by the common pity and\r\nabhorrence of mankind, there was one custom in Judea, and one\r\noccasionally practised by the Romans, which reveal some touch of\r\npassing humanity. The latter consisted in giving to the sufferer a blow\r\nunder the armpit, which, without causing death, yet hastened its\r\napproach. Of this I need not speak, because, for whatever reason, it was\r\nnot practised on this occasion. The former, which seems to have been due\r\nto the milder nature of Judaism, and which was derived from a happy\r\npiece of rabbinic exegesis on Prov. xxxi. 6, consisted in giving to the\r\ncondemned, immediately before his execution, a draught of wine medicated\r\nwith some powerful opiate. It had been the custom of wealthy ladies in\r\nJerusalem to provide this stupefying potion at their own expense, and\r\nthey did so quite irrespectively of their sympathy for any individual\r\ncriminal. It was probably taken freely by the two malefactors, but when\r\nthey offered it to Jesus he would not take it. The refusal was an act of\r\nsublimest heroism. The effect of the draught was to dull the nerves, to\r\ncloud the intellect, to provide an anæsthetic against some part at least\r\nof the lingering agonies of that dreadful death. But he, whom some\r\nmodern sceptics have been base enough to accuse of feminine feebleness\r\nand cowardly despair, preferred rather \"to look Death in the face\"--to\r\nmeet the king of terrors without striving to deaden the force of one\r\nagonizing anticipation, or to still the throbbing of one lacerated\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nThe three crosses were laid on the ground--that of Jesus, which was\r\ndoubtless taller than the other two, being placed in bitter scorn in the\r\nmidst. Perhaps the cross-beam was now nailed to the upright, and\r\ncertainly the title, which had either been borne by Jesus fastened round\r\nhis neck or carried by one of the soldiers in front of him, was now\r\nnailed to the summit of his cross. Then he was stripped naked of all his\r\nclothes, and then followed the most awful moment of all. He was laid\r\ndown upon the implement of torture. His arms were stretched along the\r\ncross-beams; and at the centre of the open palms the point of a huge\r\niron nail was placed, which, by the blow of a mallet, was driven home\r\ninto the wood. Then through either foot separately, or possibly through\r\nboth together as they were placed one over the other, another huge nail\r\ntore its way through the quivering flesh. Whether the sufferer was\r\n_also_ bound to the cross we do not know; but, to prevent the hands and\r\nfeet being torn away by the weight of the body, which could not \"rest\r\nupon nothing but four great wounds,\" there was, about the centre of the\r\ncross, a wooden projection strong enough to support, at least in part, a\r\nhuman body which soon became a weight of agony.\r\n\r\nIt was probably at this moment of inconceivable horror that the voice of\r\nthe Son of Man was heard uplifted, not in a scream of natural agony at\r\nthat fearful torture, but calmly praying in divine compassion for his\r\nbrutal and pitiless murderers--aye, and for all who in their sinful\r\nignorance crucify him afresh forever: \"Father, forgive them, for they\r\nknow not what they do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the accursed tree--with its living human burden hanging upon it\r\nin helpless agony, and suffering fresh tortures as every movement\r\nirritated the fresh rents in hands and feet--was slowly heaved up by\r\nstrong arms, and the end of it fixed firmly in a hole dug deep in the\r\nground for that purpose. The feet were but a little raised above the\r\nearth. The victim was in full reach of every hand that might choose to\r\nstrike, in close proximity to every gesture of insult and hatred. He\r\nmight hang for hours to be abused, outraged, even tortured by the\r\never-moving multitude who, with that desire to see what is horrible\r\nwhich always characterizes the coarsest hearts, had thronged to gaze\r\nupon a sight which should rather have made them weep tears of blood.\r\n\r\nAnd there, in tortures which grew ever more insupportable, ever more\r\nmaddening as time flowed on, the unhappy victims might linger in a\r\nliving death so cruelly intolerable that often they were driven to\r\nentreat and implore the spectators or the executioners, for dear pity's\r\nsake, to put an end to anguish too awful for man to bear--conscious to\r\nthe last, and often, with tears of abject misery, beseeching from their\r\nenemies the priceless boon of death.\r\n\r\nFor indeed a death by crucifixion seems to include all that pain and\r\ndeath _can_ have of horrible and ghastly--dizziness, cramp, thirst,\r\nstarvation, sleeplessness, traumatic fever, tetanus, publicity of shame,\r\nlong continuance of torment, horror of anticipation, mortification of\r\nuntended wounds--all intensified just up to the point at which they can\r\nbe endured at all, but all stopping just short of the point which would\r\ngive to the sufferer the relief of unconsciousness. The unnatural\r\nposition made every movement painful; the lacerated veins and crushed\r\ntendons throbbed with incessant anguish; the wounds, inflamed by\r\nexposure, gradually gangrened; the arteries--especially of the head and\r\nstomach--became swollen and oppressed with surcharged blood; and while\r\neach variety of misery went on gradually increasing, there was added to\r\nthem the intolerable pang of a burning and raging thirst; and all these\r\nphysical complications caused an internal excitement and anxiety which\r\nmade the prospect of death itself--of death, the awful unknown enemy, at\r\nwhose approach man usually shudders most--bear the aspect of a delicious\r\nand exquisite release.\r\n\r\nSuch was the death to which Christ was doomed; and though for him it was\r\nhappily shortened by all that he had previously endured, yet he hung\r\nfrom soon after noon until nearly sunset before \"he gave up his soul to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the cross was uplifted the leading Jews, for the first time,\r\nprominently noticed the deadly insult in which Pilate had vented his\r\nindignation. Before, in their blind rage, they had imagined that the\r\nmanner of his crucifixion was an insult aimed at _Jesus_; but now that\r\nthey saw him hanging between the two robbers, on a cross yet loftier, it\r\nsuddenly flashed upon them that it was a public scorn inflicted upon\r\n_them_. For on the white wooden tablet smeared with gypsum, which was to\r\nbe seen so conspicuously over the head of Jesus on the cross, ran, in\r\nblack letters, an inscription in the three civilized languages of the\r\nancient world--the three languages of which _one_ at least was certain\r\nto be known by every single man in that assembled multitude--in the\r\nofficial Latin, in the current Greek, in the vernacular\r\nAramaic--informing all that this Man who was thus enduring a shameful,\r\nservile death--this Man thus crucified between two _sicarii_ in the\r\nsight of the world, was \"THE KING OF THE JEWS.\"\r\n\r\nTo him who was crucified the poor malice seemed to have in it nothing of\r\nderision. Even on his cross he reigned; even there he seemed divinely\r\nelevated above the priests who had brought about his death, and the\r\ncoarse, idle, vulgar multitude who had flocked to feed their greedy eyes\r\nupon his sufferings. The malice was quite impotent against One whose\r\nspiritual and moral nobleness struck awe into dying malefactors and\r\nheathen executioners, even in the lowest abyss of his physical\r\ndegradation. With the passionate ill-humor of the Roman governor there\r\nprobably blended a vein of seriousness. While he was delighted to\r\nrevenge himself on his detested subjects by an act of public insolence,\r\nhe probably meant, or half meant, to imply that this _was_, in one\r\nsense, the King of the Jews--the greatest, the noblest, the truest of\r\nhis race, whom therefore his race had crucified. The King was not\r\nunworthy of his kingdom, but the kingdom of the King. There was\r\nsomething loftier even than royalty in the glazing eyes which never\r\nceased to look with sorrow on the City of Righteousness, which had now\r\nbecome a city of murderers. The Jews felt the intensity of the scorn\r\nwith which Pilate had treated them. It so completely poisoned their hour\r\nof triumph that they sent their chief priests in deputation, begging the\r\ngovernor to alter the obnoxious title. \"Write not,\" they said, \"'The\r\nKing of the Jews,' but that 'He _said_, I am the King of the Jews.'\" But\r\nPilate's courage, which had oozed away so rapidly at the name of Cæsar,\r\nhad now revived. He was glad in any and every way to browbeat and thwart\r\nthe men whose seditious clamor had forced him in the morning to act\r\nagainst his will. Few men had the power of giving expression to a\r\nsovereign contempt more effectually than the Romans. Without deigning\r\nany justification of what he had done, Pilate summarily dismissed these\r\nsolemn hierarchs with the curt and contemptuous reply, \"What I have\r\nwritten I have written.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the possibility of any rescue, even at the last\r\nmoment--since instances had been known of men taken from the cross and\r\nrestored to life--a quaternion of soldiers with their centurion were\r\nleft on the ground to guard the cross. The clothes of the victims always\r\nfell as perquisites to the men who had to perform so weary and\r\ndisagreeable an office. Little dreaming how exactly they were fulfilling\r\nthe mystic intimations of olden Jewish prophecy, they proceeded,\r\ntherefore, to divide between them the garments of Jesus. The _tallith_\r\nthey tore into four parts, probably ripping it down the seams; but the\r\n_cetoneth_, or undergarment, was formed of one continuous woven texture,\r\nand to tear would have been to spoil it; they therefore contented\r\nthemselves with letting it become the property of any one of the four to\r\nwhom it should fall by lot. When this had been decided, they sat down\r\nand watched him till the end, beguiling the weary lingering hours by\r\neating and drinking, and gibing, and playing dice.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene of tumult. The great body of the people seem to have\r\nstood silently at gaze; but some few of them as they passed by the\r\ncross--perhaps some of the many false witnesses and other conspirators\r\nof the previous night--mocked at Jesus with insulting noises and furious\r\ntaunts, especially bidding him come down from the cross and save\r\nhimself, since he could destroy the Temple and build it in three days.\r\nAnd the chief priests, and scribes, and elders, less awe-struck, less\r\ncompassionate than the mass of the people, were not ashamed to disgrace\r\ntheir gray-haired dignity and lofty reputation by adding their heartless\r\nreproaches to those of the evil few. Unrestrained by the noble patience\r\nof the sufferer, unsated by the accomplishment of their wicked\r\nvengeance, unmoved by the sight of helpless anguish and the look of eyes\r\nthat began to glaze in death, they congratulated one another under his\r\ncross with scornful insolence: \"He saved others, himself he cannot\r\nsave;\" \"Let this Christ, this King of Israel, descend now from the\r\ncross, that we may see and believe.\" No wonder then that the ignorant\r\nsoldiers took their share of mockery with these shameless and\r\nunvenerable hierarchs: no wonder that, at their midday meal, they\r\npledged in mock hilarity the Dying Man, cruelly holding up toward his\r\nburning lips their cups of sour wine, and echoing the Jewish taunts\r\nagainst the weakness of the King whose throne was a cross, whose crown\r\nwas thorns. Nay, even the poor wretches who were crucified with him\r\ncaught the hideous infection; comrades, perhaps, of the respited\r\nBarabbas, heirs of the rebellious fury of a Judas the Gaulonite, trained\r\nto recognize no Messiah but a Messiah of the sword, they reproachfully\r\nbade him, if his claims were true, to save himself and them. So _all_\r\nthe voices about him rang with blasphemy and spite, and in that long\r\nslow agony his dying ear caught no accent of gratitude, of pity, or of\r\nlove. Baseness, falsehood, savagery, stupidity--such were the\r\ncharacteristics of the world which thrust itself into hideous prominence\r\nbefore the Saviour's last consciousness, such the muddy and miserable\r\nstream that rolled under the cross before his dying eyes.\r\n\r\nBut amid this chorus of infamy Jesus spoke not. He _could_ have spoken.\r\nThe pains of crucifixion did not confuse the intellect or paralyze the\r\npowers of speech. We read of crucified men who, for hours together upon\r\nthe cross, vented their sorrow, their rage, or their despair in the\r\nmanner that best accorded with their character; of some who raved and\r\ncursed, and spat at their enemies; of others who protested to the last\r\nagainst the iniquity of their sentence; of others who implored\r\ncompassion with abject entreaties; of one even who, from the cross, as\r\nfrom a tribunal, harangued the multitude of his countrymen, and\r\nupbraided them with their wickedness and vice. But, except to bless and\r\nto encourage, and to add to the happiness and hope of others, Jesus\r\nspoke not. So far as the malice of the passers-by, and of priests and\r\nsanhedrists and soldiers, and of these poor robbers who suffered with\r\nhim, was concerned--as before during the trial so now upon the cross--he\r\nmaintained unbroken his kingly silence.\r\n\r\nBut that silence, joined to his patient majesty and the divine holiness\r\nand innocence which radiated from him like a halo, was more eloquent\r\nthan any words. It told earliest on one of the crucified robbers. At\r\nfirst this _bonus latro_ of the Apocryphal Gospels seems to have faintly\r\njoined in the reproaches uttered by his fellow-sinner; but when those\r\nreproaches merged into deeper blasphemy, he spoke out his inmost\r\nthought. It is probable that he had met Jesus before, and heard him, and\r\nperhaps been one of those thousands who had seen his miracles. There is\r\nindeed no authority for the legend which assigns to him the name of\r\nDysmas, or for the beautiful story of his having saved the life of the\r\nVirgin and her Child during their flight into Egypt. But on the plains\r\nof Gennesareth, perhaps from some robber's cave in the wild ravines of\r\nthe Valley of the Doves, he may well have approached his presence--he\r\nmay well have been one of those publicans and sinners who drew near to\r\nhim for to hear him. And the words of Jesus had found some room in the\r\ngood ground of his heart; they had not all fallen upon stony places.\r\nEven at this hour of shame and death, when he was suffering the just\r\nconsequence of his past evil deeds, faith triumphed. As a flame\r\nsometimes leaps up among dying embers, so amid the white ashes of a\r\nsinful life which lay so thick upon his heart, the flame of love toward\r\nhis God and his Saviour was not quite quenched. Under the hellish\r\noutcries which had broken loose around the cross of Jesus there had lain\r\na deep misgiving. Half of them seem to have been instigated by doubt and\r\nfear. Even in the self-congratulations of the priests we catch an\r\nundertone of dread. Suppose that even now some imposing miracle should\r\nbe wrought! Suppose that even now that martyr-form should burst indeed\r\ninto messianic splendor, and the King, who seemed to be in the slow\r\nmisery of death, should suddenly with a great voice summon his legions\r\nof angels, and, springing from his cross upon the rolling clouds of\r\nheaven, come in flaming fire to take vengeance upon his enemies! And the\r\nair seemed to be full of signs. There was a gloom of gathering darkness\r\nin the sky, a thrill and tremor in the solid earth, a haunting presence\r\nas of ghostly visitants who chilled the heart and hovered in awful\r\nwitness above that scene. The dying robber had joined at first in the\r\nhalf-taunting, half-despairing appeal to a defeat and weakness which\r\ncontradicted all that he had hoped; but now this defeat seemed to be\r\ngreater than victory, and this weakness more irresistible than strength.\r\nAs he looked, the faith in his heart dawned more and more into the\r\nperfect day. He had long ceased to utter any reproachful words; he now\r\nrebuked his comrade's blasphemies. Ought not the suffering innocence of\r\nhim who hung between them to shame into silence their just punishment\r\nand flagrant guilt? And so, turning his head to Jesus, he uttered the\r\nintense appeal, \"O Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.\"\r\nThen he, who had been mute amid invectives, spake at once in surpassing\r\nanswer to that humble prayer, \"Verily, I say to thee, to-day shalt thou\r\nbe with me in Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThough none spoke to comfort Jesus--though deep grief, and terror, and\r\namazement kept them dumb--yet there were hearts amid the crowd that beat\r\nin sympathy with the awful sufferer. At a distance stood a number of\r\nwomen looking on, and perhaps, even at that dread hour, expecting his\r\nimmediate deliverance. Many of these were women who had ministered to\r\nhim in Galilee, and had come from thence in the great band of Galilean\r\npilgrims. Conspicuous among this heart-stricken group were his mother\r\nMary, Mary of Magdala, Mary the wife of Clopas, mother of James and\r\nJoses, and Salome the wife of Zebedee. Some of them, as the hours\r\nadvanced, stole nearer and nearer to the cross, and at length the\r\nfilming eye of the Saviour fell on his own mother Mary, as, with the\r\nsword piercing through and through her heart, she stood with the\r\ndisciple whom he loved. His mother does not seem to have been much with\r\nhim during his ministry. It may be that the duties and cares of a humble\r\nhome rendered it impossible. At any rate, the only occasions on which we\r\nhear of her are occasions when she is with his brethren, and is joined\r\nwith them in endeavoring to influence, apart from his own purposes and\r\nauthority, his messianic course. But although at the very beginning of\r\nhis ministry he had gently shown her that the earthly and filial\r\nrelation was now to be transcended by one far more lofty and divine, and\r\nthough this end of all her high hopes must have tried her faith with an\r\noverwhelming and unspeakable sorrow, yet she was true to him in this\r\nsupreme hour of his humiliation, and would have done for him all that a\r\nmother's sympathy and love can do. Nor had he for a moment forgotten her\r\nwho had bent over his infant slumbers, and with whom he had shared those\r\nthirty years in the cottage at Nazareth. Tenderly and sadly he thought\r\nof the future that awaited her during the remaining years of her life on\r\nearth, troubled as they must be by the tumults and persecutions of a\r\nstruggling and nascent faith. After his resurrection her lot was wholly\r\ncast among his apostles, and the apostle whom he loved the most, the\r\napostle who was nearest to him in heart and life, seemed the fittest to\r\ntake care of her. To him, therefore--to John whom he had loved more than\r\nhis brethren--to John whose head had leaned upon his breast at the Last\r\nSupper, he consigned her as a sacred charge. \"Woman,\" he said to her, in\r\nfewest words, but in words which breathed the uttermost spirit of\r\ntenderness, \"behold thy son;\" and then to St. John, \"Behold thy mother.\"\r\nHe could make no gesture with those pierced hands, but he could bend his\r\nhead. They listened in speechless emotion, but from that hour--perhaps\r\nfrom that very moment--leading her away from a spectacle which did but\r\ntorture her soul with unavailing agony, that disciple took her to his\r\nown home.\r\n\r\nIt was now noon, and at the Holy City the sunshine should have been\r\nburning over that scene of horror with a power such as it has in the\r\nfull depth of an English summer-time. But instead of this, the face of\r\nthe heavens was black, and the noonday sun was \"turned into darkness,\"\r\non \"this great and terrible day of the Lord.\" It could have been no\r\ndarkness of any natural eclipse, for the Paschal moon was at the full;\r\nbut it was one of those \"signs from heaven\" for which, during the\r\nministry of Jesus, the Pharisees had so often clamored in vain. The\r\nearly Fathers appealed to pagan authorities--the historian Phallus, the\r\nchronicler Phlegon--for such a darkness; but we have no means of testing\r\nthe accuracy of these references, and it is quite possible that the\r\ndarkness was a local gloom which hung densely over the guilty city and\r\nits immediate neighborhood. But whatever it was, it clearly filled the\r\nminds of all who beheld it with yet deeper misgiving. The taunts and\r\njeers of the Jewish priests and the heathen soldiers were evidently\r\nconfined to the earlier hours of the Crucifixion. Its later stages seem\r\nto have thrilled alike the guilty and the innocent with emotions of\r\ndread and horror. Of the incidents of those last three hours we are told\r\nnothing, and that awful obscuration of the noonday sun may well have\r\noverawed every heart into an inaction respecting which there was nothing\r\nto relate. What Jesus suffered _then_ for us men and our salvation we\r\ncannot know, for during those three hours he hung upon his cross in\r\nsilence and darkness; or, if he spoke, there was none there to record\r\nhis words. But toward the close of that time his anguish culminated,\r\nand, emptied to the very uttermost of that glory which he had since the\r\nworld began, drinking to the very deepest dregs the cup of humiliation\r\nand bitterness, enduring not only to have taken upon him the form of a\r\nservant, but also to suffer the last infamy which human hatred could\r\nimpose on servile helplessness, he uttered that mysterious cry, of which\r\nthe full significance will never be fathomed by man: _Eli, Eli, lama\r\nSabachthani?_ (\"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\")\r\n\r\nIn those words, quoting the psalm in which the early Fathers rightly\r\nsaw a far-off prophecy of the whole passion of Christ, he borrowed from\r\nDavid's utter agony the expression of his own. In that hour he was\r\nalone. Sinking from depth to depth of unfathomable suffering, until, at\r\nthe close approach of a death which--because he was God, and yet had\r\nbeen made man--was more awful to him than it could ever be to any of the\r\nsons of men, it seemed as if even his divine humanity could endure no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the voice of the sufferer--though uttered loudly in that\r\nparoxysm of an emotion which, in another, would almost have touched the\r\nverge of despair--was yet rendered more uncertain and indistinct from\r\nthe condition of exhaustion in which he hung; and so, amid the darkness,\r\nand confused noise, and dull footsteps of the moving multitude, there\r\nwere some who did not hear what he had said. They had caught only the\r\nfirst syllable, and said to one another that he had called on the name\r\nof Elijah. The readiness with which they seized this false impression is\r\nanother proof of the wild state of excitement and terror--the\r\ninvoluntary dread of something great and unforeseen and terrible--to\r\nwhich they had been reduced from their former savage insolence. For\r\nElijah, the great prophet of the Old Covenant, was inextricably mingled\r\nwith all the Jewish expectations of a Messiah, and these expectations\r\nwere full of wrath. The coming of Elijah would be the coming of a day of\r\nfire, in which the sun should be turned into blackness and the moon into\r\nblood, and the powers of heaven should be shaken. Already the noonday\r\nsun was shrouded in unnatural eclipse; might not some awful form at any\r\nmoment rend the heavens and come down, touch the mountains and they\r\nshould smoke? The vague anticipation of conscious guilt was unfulfilled.\r\nNot such as yet was to be the method of God's workings. His messages to\r\nman for many ages more were not to be in the thunder and earthquake, not\r\nin rushing wind or roaring flame, but in the \"still small voice\"\r\nspeaking always amid the apparent silences of Time in whispers\r\nintelligible to man's heart, but in which there is neither speech nor\r\nlanguage, though the voice is heard.\r\n\r\nBut now the end was very rapidly approaching, and Jesus, who had been\r\nhanging for nearly six hours upon the cross, was suffering from that\r\ntorment of thirst which is most difficult of all for the human frame to\r\nbear--perhaps the most unmitigated of the many separate sources of\r\nanguish which were combined in this worst form of death. No doubt this\r\nburning thirst was aggravated by seeing the Roman soldiers drinking so\r\nnear the cross; and happily for mankind, Jesus had never sanctioned the\r\nunnatural affectation of stoic impassibility. And so he uttered the one\r\nsole word of physical suffering which had been wrung from him by all the\r\nhours in which he had endured the extreme of all that man can inflict.\r\nHe cried aloud, \"I thirst.\" Probably a few hours before, the cry would\r\nhave only provoked a roar of frantic mockery; but now the lookers-on\r\nwere reduced by awe to a readier humanity. Near the cross there lay on\r\nthe ground the large earthen vessel containing the _posca_, which was\r\nthe ordinary drink of the Roman soldiers. The mouth of it was filled\r\nwith a piece of sponge, which served as a cork. Instantly some one--we\r\nknow not whether he was friend or enemy, or merely one who was there out\r\nof idle curiosity--took out the sponge and dipped it in the posca to\r\ngive it to Jesus. But low as was the elevation of the cross, the head of\r\nthe sufferer, as it rested on the horizontal beam of the accursed tree,\r\nwas just beyond the man's reach; and therefore he put the sponge at the\r\nend of a stalk of hyssop--about a foot long--and held it up to the\r\nparched and dying lips. Even this simple act of pity, which Jesus did\r\nnot refuse, seemed to jar upon the condition of nervous excitement with\r\nwhich some of the multitude were looking on. \"Let be,\" they said to the\r\nman, \"let us see whether Elias is coming to save him.\" The man did not\r\ndesist from his act of mercy, but when it was done he, too, seems to\r\nhave echoed those uneasy words. But Elias came not, nor human comforter,\r\nnor angel deliverer. It was the will of God, it was the will of the Son\r\nof God, that he should be \"perfected through sufferings\"; that--for the\r\neternal example of all his children as long as the world should last--he\r\nshould \"endure unto the end.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the end was come. Once more, in the words of the sweet Psalmist\r\nof Israel, but adding to them that title of trustful love which, through\r\nhim, is permitted to the use of all mankind, \"Father,\" he said, \"into\r\nthy hands I commend my spirit.\" Then with one more great effort he\r\nuttered the last cry--\"It is finished.\" It may be that that great cry\r\nruptured some of the vessels of his heart, for no sooner had it been\r\nuttered than he bowed his head upon his breast and yielded his life, \"a\r\nransom for many\"--a willing sacrifice to his Heavenly Father. \"Finished\r\nwas his holy life; with his life his struggle, with his struggle his\r\nwork, with his work the redemption, with the redemption the foundation\r\nof the new world.\" At that moment the veil of the Temple was rent in\r\ntwain from the top to the bottom. An earthquake shook the earth and\r\nsplit the rocks, and as it rolled away from their places the great\r\nstones which closed and covered the cavern sepulchres of the Jews, so it\r\nseemed to the imaginations of many to have disimprisoned the spirits of\r\nthe dead, and to have filled the air with ghostly visitants, who after\r\nChrist had risen appeared to linger in the Holy City. These\r\ncircumstances of amazement, joined to all they had observed in the\r\nbearing of the Crucified, cowed even the cruel and gay indifference of\r\nthe Roman soldiers. On the centurion who was in command of them the\r\nwhole scene had exercised a yet deeper influence. As he stood opposite\r\nto the cross and saw the Saviour die, he glorified God and exclaimed,\r\n\"This Man was in truth righteous\"--nay, more, \"This Man was a Son of\r\nGod.\" Even the multitude, utterly sobered from their furious excitement\r\nand frantic rage, began to be weighed down with a guilty consciousness\r\nthat the scene which they had witnessed had in it something more awful\r\nthan they could have conceived, and as they returned to Jerusalem they\r\nwailed and beat upon their breasts. Well might they do so! This was the\r\nlast drop in a full cup of wickedness: this was the beginning of the end\r\nof their city and name and race.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth that scene was more awful than they, or even we, can know.\r\nThe secular historian, be he ever so sceptical, cannot fail to see in it\r\nthe central point of the world's history. Whether he be a believer in\r\nChrist or not, he cannot refuse to admit that this new religion grew\r\nfrom the smallest of all seeds to be a mighty tree, so that the birds of\r\nthe air took refuge in its branches; that it was the little stone cut\r\nwithout hands which dashed into pieces the colossal image of heathen\r\ngreatness, and grew till it became a great mountain and filled the\r\nearth. Alike to the infidel and to the believer the Crucifixion is the\r\nboundary instant between ancient and modern days. Morally and\r\nphysically, no less than spiritually, the faith of Christ was the\r\n_palingenesia_ of the world. It came like the dawn of a new spring to\r\nnations \"effete with the drunkenness of crime.\" The struggle was long\r\nand hard, but from the hour when Christ died began the death-knell to\r\nevery satanic tyranny and every tolerated abomination. From that hour\r\nholiness became the universal ideal of all who name the name of Christ\r\nas their Lord, and the attainment of that ideal the common heritage of\r\nsouls in which his spirit dwells.\r\n\r\nThe effects, then, of the work of Christ are even to the unbeliever\r\nindisputable and historical. It expelled cruelty; it curbed passion; it\r\nbranded suicide; it punished and repressed an execrable infanticide; it\r\ndrove the shameless impurities of heathendom into a congenial darkness.\r\nThere was hardly a class whose wrongs it did not remedy. It rescued the\r\ngladiator; it freed the slave; it protected the captive; it nursed the\r\nsick; it sheltered the orphan; it elevated the woman; it shrouded as\r\nwith a halo of sacred innocence the tender years of the child. In every\r\nregion of life its ameliorating influence was felt. It changed pity from\r\na vice into a virtue. It elevated poverty from a curse into a beatitude.\r\nIt ennobled labor from a vulgarity into a dignity and a duty. It\r\nsanctified marriage from little more than a burdensome convention into\r\nlittle less than a blessed sacrament. It revealed for the first time the\r\nangelic beauty of a purity of which men had despaired and of a meekness\r\nat which they had utterly scoffed. It created the very conception of\r\ncharity, and broadened the limits of its obligation from the narrow\r\ncircle of a neighborhood to the widest horizons of the race. And while\r\nit thus evolved the idea of humanity as a common brotherhood, even where\r\nits tidings were _not_ believed--all over the world, wherever its\r\ntidings _were_ believed, it cleansed the life and elevated the soul of\r\neach individual man. And in all lands where it has moulded the\r\ncharacters of its true believers it has created hearts so pure and lives\r\nso peaceful and homes so sweet that it might seem as though those angels\r\nwho had heralded its advent had also whispered to every depressed and\r\ndespairing sufferer among the sons of men: \"Though ye have lien among\r\nthe pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove, that is covered with\r\nsilver wings, and her feathers like gold.\"\r\n\r\nOthers, if they _can_ and _will_, may see in such a work as this no\r\ndivine Providence, they may think it philosophical enlightenment to hold\r\nthat Christianity and Christendom are adequately accounted for by the\r\nidle dreams of a noble self-deceiver and the passionate hallucinations\r\nof a recovered demoniac. We persecute them not, we denounce them not, we\r\njudge them not; but we say that, unless all life be a hollow, there\r\ncould have been no such miserable origin to the sole religion of the\r\nworld which holds the perfect balance between philosophy and popularity,\r\nbetween religion and morals, between meek submissiveness and the pride\r\nof freedom, between the ideal and the real, between the inward and the\r\noutward, between modest stillness and heroic energy--nay, between the\r\ntenderest conservatism and the boldest plans of world-wide reformation.\r\nThe witness of history to Christ is a witness which has been given with\r\nirresistible cogency; and it has been so given to none but him.\r\n\r\nBut while even the unbeliever must see what the life and death of Jesus\r\nhave effected in the world, to the believer that life and death are\r\nsomething deeper still; to him they are nothing less than a resurrection\r\nfrom the dead. He sees in the cross of Christ something which far\r\ntranscends its historical significance. He sees in it the fulfilment of\r\nall prophecy as well as the consummation of all history; he sees in it\r\nthe explanation of the mystery of birth, and the conquest over the\r\nmystery of the grave. In that life he finds a perfect example; in that\r\ndeath an infinite redemption. As he contemplates the Incarnation and the\r\nCrucifixion, he no longer feels that God is far away, and that this\r\nearth is but a disregarded speck in the infinite azure, and he himself\r\nbut an insignificant atom chance-thrown amid the thousand million living\r\nsouls of an innumerable race, but he exclaims in faith and hope and\r\nlove: \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men; yea, he will be their\r\nGod, and they shall be his people.\" \"Ye are the temple of the living\r\nGod; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was westering as the darkness rolled away from the completed\r\nsacrifice. They who had not thought it a pollution to inaugurate their\r\nfeast by the murder of their Messiah, were seriously alarmed lest the\r\nsanctity of the following day--which began at sunset--should be\r\ncompromised by the hanging of the corpses on the cross. And horrible to\r\nrelate, the crucified often lived for many hours--nay, even for two\r\ndays--in their torture. The Jews therefore begged Pilate that their legs\r\nmight be broken, and their bodies taken down. This _crurifragium_, as it\r\nwas called, consisted in striking the legs of the sufferers with a heavy\r\nmallet, a violence which seemed always to have hastened, if it did not\r\ninstantly cause, their death. Nor would the Jews be the only persons who\r\nwould be anxious to hasten the end by giving the deadly blow. Until life\r\nwas extinct the soldiers appointed to guard the execution dared not\r\nleave the ground. The wish, therefore, was readily granted. The soldiers\r\nbroke the legs of the two malefactors first, and then, coming to Jesus,\r\nfound that the great cry had been indeed his last, and that he was dead\r\nalready. They did not therefore break his legs, and thus unwittingly\r\npreserved the symbolism of that Paschal lamb, of which he was the\r\nantetype, and of which it had been commanded that \"a bone of it shall\r\nnot be broken.\" And yet, as he might be only in a syncope--as instances\r\nhad been known in which men apparently dead had been taken down from the\r\ncross and resuscitated--and as the lives of the soldiers would have had\r\nto answer for any irregularity, one of them, in order to make death\r\ncertain, drove the broad head of his _hasta_ into his side. The wound,\r\nas it was meant to do, pierced the region of the heart, and \"forthwith,\"\r\nsays St. John, with an emphatic appeal to the truthfulness of his\r\neye-witness--an appeal which would be singularly and impossibly\r\nblasphemous if the narrative were the forgery which so much elaborate\r\nmodern criticism has wholly failed to prove that it is--\"forthwith came\r\nthere out blood and water.\" Whether the water was due to some abnormal\r\npathological conditions caused by the dreadful complication of the\r\nSaviour's sufferings, or whether it rather means that the pericardium\r\nhad been rent by the spear point, and that those who took down the body\r\nobserved some drops of its serum mingled with the blood, in either case\r\nthat lance thrust was sufficient to hush all the heretical assertions\r\nthat Jesus had only _seemed_ to die; and as it assured the soldiers, so\r\nshould it assure all who have doubted, that he, who on the third day\r\nrose again, had in truth been crucified, dead, and buried, and that his\r\nsoul had passed into the unseen world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The disputed date of the Crucifixion of Jesus--long variously\r\nplaced between A.D. 29 and 33--is definitely fixed by many later\r\nauthorities at the year 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nA.D. 33\r\n\r\nRENAN      WISE      NEWMAN\r\n\r\n     It is a favorite view of historians and critical students that\r\n     Jesus was born at a time when the world seemed especially prepared\r\n     for his birth. The correspondence between world conditions then and\r\n     the actual process of Christianity in its rise and early spread\r\n     appears to conform to evolutionary laws as regarded in the light of\r\n     modern interpretation.\r\n\r\n     In its origin Christianity is most intimately connected with\r\n     Judaism, the parent religion. The known world, however, in the time\r\n     of Jesus was largely under Roman dominion. This was true of the\r\n     land where Jesus was born. The Roman Empire was then comparatively\r\n     at peace, and it was the admonition of St. Paul that the first\r\n     Christians should maintain that peace. The wide sovereignty of Rome\r\n     gave the apostles of Christ access to different nations, many of\r\n     whom had become civilized under Roman influence. But pure\r\n     monotheism existed only among the Jews. All other nations had a\r\n     variety of gods and peculiar forms of worship. In most of the pagan\r\n     religions there were elements of truth and beauty, but they lacked\r\n     in ethical principles and in moral application to life. Most of\r\n     their priestcraft was a vulgar imposition upon the ignorance and\r\n     credulity of the common people. The prevailing philosophies--which,\r\n     among the more enlightened, took the place of religion--were the\r\n     Grecian, adopted also by the Romans, and the oriental, with\r\n     numerous followers in Persia, Syria, Chaldæa, Egypt, and likewise\r\n     among the Jews. But the philosophers were divided into antagonistic\r\n     sects. Out of such conditions no practical religion could develop.\r\n     In the doctrines of Buddhism were to be found the spirit and\r\n     purpose of a devout and humanely religious people, but the\r\n     intricate mythology and racial and other limitations of Buddhism\r\n     forbade that, although it conquered the half of Asia, it should\r\n     ever become a universal faith.\r\n\r\n     The condition of the Jews at this period was little better than\r\n     that of other peoples. Among the Jews there was a lack of\r\n     intellectual unity, and their moral ideals had been lowered.\r\n     Oppressed by Herod, the tributary Roman King--who, although\r\n     professedly a Jew, copied the open despisers of all religion--they\r\n     yielded to the influences of Roman luxury and licentiousness which\r\n     spread over Palestine. Although still conducted by the priests and\r\n     Levites and under the eye of the Sanhedrim or senate, the Jewish\r\n     religion had lost much of its earlier character. Like philosophy,\r\n     it was vexed with contending sects. Strict observance of the Mosaic\r\n     law and the performance of prescriptive rites and duties were in\r\n     the main regarded as the sum of religion.\r\n\r\n     The race of prophets appeared extinct until prophecy was revived in\r\n     John the Baptist. The successors of the Maccabæan patriots were not\r\n     animated by their spirit. There was widespread and passionate\r\n     expectation of a national messiah, but not such a messiah as John\r\n     proclaimed and Jesus proved to be; rather a powerful warrior and\r\n     vindicator of Jewish liberty. Galilee, the early home of Jesus, was\r\n     especially stirred with messianic fervor. In such a condition of\r\n     the national mind, and at such a stage of the world's empire, it\r\n     seems natural in the course of spiritual evolution that such a\r\n     teacher as Jesus--a spiritual messiah--should arise to be the\r\n     deliverer not of one people only, but of the world itself. Among\r\n     the Jewish doctors when Jesus was a child was at least one wise and\r\n     liberal rabbi, Hillel, a Pharisee, the great reformer of his time,\r\n     and \"the most eminent Jew of the generation before the birth of\r\n     Jesus.\" At his feet the boy Jesus may have sat and learned lessons\r\n     of wisdom and liberality. It gives us a reassurance of spiritual\r\n     continuity to think that the teachings of Hillel may have \"helped\r\n     to inspire the humane and tender counsels of the founder of\r\n     Christianity.\"\r\n\r\n     In grouping the glowing words of Renan, with their fine spiritual\r\n     interpretations and descriptive eloquence, the judgments of an\r\n     eminent contemporary Jewish scholar, and Newman's learned yet\r\n     simple portrayal of the Church as it took form in its early\r\n     environment, and as it was seen through the media of contemporary\r\n     governments, customs, and criticisms, it is believed that readers\r\n     will derive satisfaction, and will be aided in their own inquiries,\r\n     through this threefold presentation. On so vast a subject, with its\r\n     momentous implications, no single author, however profound his\r\n     genius, can do more than contribute a partial essay toward the\r\n     many-sided truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ERNEST RENAN\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of the arrest of Jesus, and immediately after his death,\r\nit is probable that many of the disciples had already found their way to\r\nthe northern provinces. At the time of the Resurrection a rumor was\r\nspread abroad, according to which it was in Galilee that he would be\r\nseen again. Some of the women who had been to the sepulchre came back\r\nwith the report that the angel had said to them that Jesus had already\r\npreceded them into Galilee. Others said that it was Jesus himself who\r\nhad ordered them to go there. Now and then some people said that they\r\nthemselves remembered that he had said so during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that at the end of a few days, probably after the\r\nPaschal Feast of the Passover had been quite over, the disciples\r\nbelieved they had a command to return into their own country, and to it\r\naccordingly they returned. Perhaps the visions began to abate at\r\nJerusalem. A species of melancholy seized them. The brief appearances of\r\nJesus were not sufficient to compensate for the enormous void left by\r\nhis absence. In a melancholy mood they thought of the lake and of the\r\nbeautiful mountains where they had received a foretaste of the kingdom\r\nof God. The women especially wished, at any cost, to return to the\r\ncountry where they had enjoyed so much happiness. It must be observed\r\nthat the order to depart came especially from them. That odious city\r\nweighed them down. They longed to see once more the ground where they\r\nhad possessed Him whom they loved, well assured in advance of meeting\r\nhim again there.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the disciples then departed, full of joy and hope,\r\nperhaps in the company of the caravan which took back the pilgrims from\r\nthe Feast of the Passover. What they hoped to find in Galilee were not\r\nonly transient visions, but Jesus himself to continue with them, as he\r\nhad done before his death. An intense expectation filled their souls.\r\nWas he going to restore the kingdom of Israel, to found definitely the\r\nkingdom of God, and, as was said, \"reveal his justice\"? Everything was\r\npossible. They already called to mind the smiling landscapes where they\r\nhad enjoyed his presence. Many believed that he had given to them a\r\nrendezvous upon a mountain, probably the same to which with them there\r\nclung so many sweet recollections. Never, it is certain, had there been\r\na more pleasant journey. All their dreams of happiness were on the point\r\nof being realized. They were going to see him once more! And, in fact,\r\nthey did see him again. Hardly restored to their harmless chimeras, they\r\nbelieved themselves to be in the midst of the gospel-dispensation\r\nperiod. It was now drawing near to the end of April. The ground is then\r\nstrewn with red anemones, which were probably those \"lilies of the\r\nfields\" from which Jesus delighted to draw his similes. At each step his\r\nwords were brought to mind, adhering, as it were, to the thousand\r\naccidental objects they met by the way. Here was the tree, the flower,\r\nthe seed, from which he had taken his parables; there was the hill on\r\nwhich he delivered his most touching discourses; here was the little\r\nship from which he taught. It was like the recommencement of a beautiful\r\ndream--like a vanished illusion which had reappeared. The enchantment\r\nseemed to revive. The sweet Galilean \"Kingdom of God\" had recovered its\r\nsway. The clear atmosphere, the mornings upon the shore or upon the\r\nmountain, the nights passed on the lakes watching the nets, all these\r\nreturned again to them in distinct visions. They saw him everywhere\r\nwhere they had lived with him. Of course it was not the joy of the first\r\nenjoyment. Sometimes the lake had to them the appearance of being very\r\nsolitary. But a great love is satisfied with little. If all of us, while\r\nwe are alive, could surreptitiously, once a year, and during a moment\r\nlong enough to exchange but a few words, behold again those loved ones\r\nwhom we have lost--death would not be death!\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of mind of this faithful band, in this short period\r\nwhen Christianity seemed to return for a moment to his cradle and bid to\r\nhim an eternal adieu. The principal disciples, Peter, Thomas, Nathaniel,\r\nthe sons of Zebedee, met again on the shores of the lake, and henceforth\r\nlived together; they had taken up again their former calling of\r\nfishermen, at Bethsaida or at Capernaum. The Galilean women were no\r\ndoubt with them. They had insisted more than the others on that return,\r\nwhich was to them a heartfelt love. This was their last act in the\r\nestablishment of Christianity. From that moment they disappear. Faithful\r\nto their love, their wish was to quit no more the country in which they\r\nhad tasted their greatest delight. More than five hundred persons were\r\nalready devoted to the memory of Jesus. In default of the lost master\r\nthey obeyed the disciples, the most authoritative--Peter--in particular.\r\n\r\nThe activity of these ardent souls had already turned in another\r\ndirection. What they believed to have heard from the lips of the dear\r\nrisen One was the order to go forth and preach, and to convert the\r\nworld. But where should they commence? Naturally, at Jerusalem. The\r\nreturn to Jerusalem was then resolved upon by those who at that time had\r\nthe direction of the sect. As these journeys were ordinarily made by\r\ncaravan at the time of the feasts, we now suppose, with all manner of\r\nlikelihood, that the return in question took place at the Feast of\r\nTabernacles at the close of the year 33, or the Paschal Feast of the\r\nyear 34. Galilee was thus abandoned by Christianity, and abandoned\r\nforever. The little Church which remained there continued, no doubt, to\r\nexist; but we hear it no more spoken of. It was probably broken up, like\r\nall the rest, by the frightful disaster which then overtook the country\r\nduring the war of Vespasian; the wreck of the dispersed community sought\r\nrefuge beyond Jordan. After the war it was not Christianity which was\r\nbrought back into Galilee; it was Judaism.\r\n\r\nGalilee thus counted but an hour in the history of Christianity; but it\r\nwas the sacred hour, _par excellence_; it gave to the new religion that\r\nwhich has made it endure--its poetry, its penetrating charms. \"The\r\nGospel,\" after the manner of the synoptics, was a Galilean work. But\r\n\"the Gospel\" thus extended has been the principal cause of the success\r\nof Christianity, and continues to be the surest guarantee of its future.\r\nIt is probable that a fraction of the little school which surrounded\r\nJesus in his last days remained at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIt is about this period that we can place the vision of James, mentioned\r\nby St. Paul. James was the brother, or at least a relation, of Jesus. We\r\ndo not find that he had accompanied Jesus on his last sojourn to\r\nJerusalem. He probably went there with the apostles, when the latter\r\nquitted Galilee.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that the family of Jesus, some of whose members\r\nduring his life had been incredulous and hostile to his mission,\r\nconstituted now a part of the Church, and held in it a very exalted\r\nposition. One is led to suppose that the reconciliation took place\r\nduring the sojourn of the apostles in Galilee. The celebrity which had\r\nattached itself to the name of their relative, those who believed in\r\nhim, and were assured of having seen him after he had arisen, served to\r\nmake an impression on their minds. From the time of the definite\r\nestablishment of the apostles at Jerusalem, we find with them Mary, the\r\nmother of Jesus, and the brothers of Jesus. In what concerns Mary, it\r\nappears that John, thinking in this to obey a recommendation of the\r\nMaster, had adopted and taken her to his own home. He perhaps took her\r\nback to Jerusalem. This woman, whose personal history and character have\r\nremained veiled in obscurity, assumed hence great importance. The words\r\nthat the evangelist put into the mouth of some unknown woman, \"Blessed\r\nis the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked,\" began\r\nto be verified. It is probable that Mary survived her son a few years.\r\nAs for the brothers of Jesus, their history is wrapped in obscurity.\r\nJesus had several brothers and sisters. It seemed probable, however,\r\nthat in the class of persons which were called \"Brothers of the Lord\"\r\nthere were included relations in the second degree. The question is only\r\nof moment so far as it concerns James, whom we see playing a great part\r\nin the first thirty years of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe apostles henceforth separated no more, except to make temporary\r\njourneys. Jerusalem became their head-quarters; they seemed to be afraid\r\nto disperse, while certain acts served to reveal in them the\r\nprepossession of being opposed to return again into Galilee, which\r\nlatter had dissolved its little society. An express order of Jesus is\r\nsupposed to have interdicted their quitting Jerusalem, before, at least,\r\nthe great manifestations which were to take place. People's thoughts\r\nwere turned with great force toward a promise which it was supposed\r\nJesus had made. During his lifetime Jesus, it was said, had often spoken\r\nof the Holy Spirit, which was understood to mean a personification of\r\ndivine wisdom. He had promised his disciples that the Spirit would nerve\r\nthem in the combats that they would have to engage in, would be their\r\ninspirer in difficulties, and their advocate if they had to speak in\r\npublic. Sometimes it was supposed that Jesus suddenly presented himself\r\nin the midst of his disciples assembled, and breathed on them out of his\r\nown mouth a current of vivifying air. At other times the disappearance\r\nof Jesus was regarded as a premonition of the coming of the Spirit. Many\r\npeople established an intimate connection between this descent and the\r\nrestoration of the kingdom of Israel.\r\n\r\nThe affection that the disciples had the one for the other, while Jesus\r\nwas alive, was thus enhanced tenfold after his death. They formed a very\r\nsmall and very retired society, and lived exclusively by themselves. At\r\nJerusalem they numbered about one hundred and twenty. Their piety was\r\nactive, and, as yet, completely restrained by the forms of Jewish\r\npiety. The Temple was then the chief place of devotion. They worked, no\r\ndoubt, for a living; but at that time manual labor in Jewish society\r\nengaged very few. Everyone had a trade, but that trade by no means\r\nhindered a man from being educated and well-bred.\r\n\r\nThe dominant idea in the Christian community, at the moment at which we\r\nare now arrived, was the coming of the Holy Spirit. People were believed\r\nto receive it in the form of a mysterious breath, which passed over the\r\nassembly. Every inward consolation, every bold movement, every flush of\r\nenthusiasm, every feeling of lively and pleasant gayety, which was\r\nexperienced without knowing whence it came, was the work of the Spirit.\r\nThese simple consciences referred, as usual, to some exterior cause the\r\nexquisite sentiments which were being created in them. When all were\r\nassembled, and when they awaited in silence inspiration from on high, a\r\nmurmur, any noise whatever, was believed to be the coming of the Spirit.\r\nIn the early times, it was the apparitions of Jesus which were produced\r\nin this manner. Now the turn of ideas had changed. It was the divine\r\nbreath which passed over the little Church, and filled it with a\r\ncelestial effluvium. These beliefs were strengthened by notions drawn\r\nfrom the Old Testament. The prophetic spirit is represented in the\r\nHebrew books as a breathing which penetrates man and inspires him. In\r\nthe beautiful vision of Elijah, God passes by in the form of a gentle\r\nwind, which produces a slight rustling noise.\r\n\r\nAmong all these \"descents of the Spirit,\" which appear to have been\r\nfrequent enough, there was one which left a profound impression on the\r\nnascent Church. One day, when the brethren were assembled, a\r\nthunder-storm burst forth. A violent wind threw open the windows: the\r\nheavens were on fire. Thunder-storms, in these countries, are\r\naccompanied by prodigious sheets of lightning; the atmosphere is, as it\r\nwere, everywhere furrowed with ridges of flame. Whether the electric\r\nfluid had penetrated the room itself or whether a dazzling flash of\r\nlightning had suddenly illuminated the faces of all, everyone was\r\nconvinced that the Spirit had entered, and that it had alighted on the\r\nhead of each in the form of tongues of fire. The idea that the Spirit\r\nhad alighted on them in the form of jets of flame, resembling tongues of\r\nfire, gave rise to a series of singular ideas, which took a foremost\r\nplace in the thought of the period.\r\n\r\nThe tongues of fire appeared a striking symbol. People were convinced\r\nthat God desired to signify in this manner that he poured out upon the\r\napostles his most precious gifts of eloquence and of inspiration. But\r\nthey did not stop there. Jerusalem was, like the majority of the large\r\ncities of the East, a city in which many languages were spoken. The\r\ndiversity of tongues was one of the difficulties which one found there\r\nin the way of propagating a universal form of faith. One of the things,\r\nmoreover, which alarmed the apostles, at the commencement of a ministry\r\ndestined to embrace the world, was the number of languages which were\r\nspoken there: they were asking themselves incessantly how they could\r\nlearn so many tongues. \"The gift of tongues\" became thus a marvellous\r\nprivilege. It was believed that the preaching of the Gospel would clear\r\naway the obstacle which was created by the diversity of idioms. There\r\nwas in this a liberal idea; they meant to imply that the Gospel should\r\nhave no language of its own; that it should be translatable into every\r\ntongue; and that the translation should be of the same value as the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nThe custom of living together, holding the same faith, and indulging the\r\nsame expectation, necessarily produced many common habits. All lived in\r\ncommon, having but one heart and one mind. No one possessed anything\r\nwhich was his own. On becoming a disciple of Jesus, one sold one's goods\r\nand made a gift of the proceeds to the society. The chiefs of the\r\nsociety then distributed the common possessions to each, according to\r\nhis needs. They lived in the same quarter. They took their meals\r\ntogether, and continued to attach to them the mystic sense that Jesus\r\nhad prescribed. They passed long hours in prayers. Their prayers were\r\nsometimes improvised aloud, but more often meditated in silence. The\r\nconcord was perfect; no dogmatic quarrels, no disputes in regard to\r\nprecedence. The tender recollection of Jesus effaced all dissensions.\r\nJoy, lively and deep-seated, was in every heart. Their morals were\r\naustere, but pervaded by a soft and tender sentiment. They assembled in\r\nhouses to pray and to devote themselves to ecstatic exercises. The\r\nrecollection of these two or three first years remained and seemed to\r\nthem like a terrestrial paradise, which Christianity will pursue\r\nhenceforth in all its dreams and to which it will vainly endeavor to\r\nreturn. Such an organization could only be applicable to a very small\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe apostles chosen by Jesus, and who were supposed to have received\r\nfrom him a special mandate to announce to the world the kingdom of God,\r\nhad, in the little community, an incontestable superiority. One of the\r\nfirst cares, as soon as they saw the sect settle quietly down at\r\nJerusalem, was to fill the vacancy that Judas of Kerioth had left in its\r\nranks. The opinion that the latter had betrayed his master, and had been\r\nthe cause of his death, became more and more general. The legend was\r\nmixed up with him, and every day one heard of some new circumstance\r\nwhich enhanced the black-heartedness of his deed. In order to replace\r\nhim, it was resolved to have recourse to a vote of some sort. The sole\r\ncondition was that the candidate should be chosen from the groups of the\r\noldest disciples, who had been witnesses of the whole series of events,\r\nfrom the time of the baptism of John. This reduced considerably the\r\nnumber of those eligible. Two only were found in the ranks, Joseph\r\nBar-Saba, who bore the name of Justus, and Matthias. The lot fell upon\r\nMatthias, who was accounted as one of the Twelve. But this was the sole\r\ninstance of such a replacing.\r\n\r\nThe body of Twelve lived, generally, permanently at Jerusalem. Till\r\nabout the year 60 the apostles did not leave the holy city except upon\r\ntemporary missions. This explains the obscurity in which the majority of\r\nthe members of the central council remained. Very few of them had a\r\n_rôle_. This council was a kind of sacred college or senate, destined\r\nonly to represent tradition and a spirit of conservatism. It finished by\r\nbeing relieved of every active function, so that its members had nothing\r\nto do but to preach and pray; but as yet the brilliant feats of\r\npreaching had not fallen to their lot. Their names were hardly known\r\noutside Jerusalem, and about the year 70 or 80 the lists which were\r\ngiven of these chosen Twelve agreed only in the principal names.\r\n\r\nThe \"Brothers of the Lord\" appear often by the side of the \"apostles,\"\r\nalthough they were distinct from them. Their authority, however, was\r\nequal to that of the apostles. Here two groups constituted, in the\r\nnascent Church, a sort of aristocracy founded solely on the more or less\r\nintimate relations that their members had had with the Master. These\r\nwere the men whom Paul denominated \"the pillars\" of the Church at\r\nJerusalem. For the rest, we see that no distinctions in the\r\necclesiastical hierarchy yet existed. The title was nothing; the\r\npersonal authority was everything. The principle of ecclesiastical\r\ncelibacy was already established, but it required time to bring all\r\nthese germs to their complete development. Peter and Philip were married\r\nand had sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nThe term used to designate the assembly of the faithful was the Hebrew\r\n_Kahal_, which was rendered by the essentially democratic word\r\n_Ecclesia_, which is the convocation of the people in the ancient\r\nGrecian cities, the summons to the Pnyx or the _Agora_. Commencing with\r\nthe second or the third century before Jesus Christ, the words of the\r\nAthenian democracy became a sort of common law in Hellenic language;\r\nmany of these terms, on account of their having been used in the Greek\r\nconfraternities, entered into the Christian vocabulary. It was, in\r\nreality, the popular life, which, restrained for centuries, resumed its\r\npower under forms altogether different. The primitive Church was, in its\r\nway, a little democracy.\r\n\r\nThe power which was ascribed to the Church assembled and to its chiefs\r\nwas enormous. The Church conferred every mission, and was guided solely\r\nin its choice by the signs given by the Spirit. Its authority went as\r\nfar as decreeing death. It is recorded that at the voice of Peter\r\nseveral delinquents had fallen back and expired immediately. St. Paul, a\r\nlittle later, was not afraid, in excommunicating a fornicator, \"to\r\ndeliver him to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit\r\nmay be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\" Excommunication was held to\r\nbe equivalent to a sentence of death. The apostles were believed to be\r\ninvested with supernatural powers. In pronouncing such condemnations,\r\nthey thought that their anathemas could not fail but be effectual. The\r\nterrible impression which their excommunications produced, and the\r\nhatred manifested by the brethren against all the members thus cut off,\r\nwere sufficient, in fact, in many cases, to bring about death, or at\r\nleast to compel the culprit to expatriate himself. Accounts like those\r\nof the death of Ananias and Sapphira did not excite any scruple. The\r\nidea of the civil power was so foreign to all that world placed without\r\nthe pale of the Roman law, people were so persuaded that the Church was\r\na complete society, sufficient in itself, that no person saw, in a\r\nmiracle leading to death or the mutilation of an individual, an outrage\r\npunishable by the civil law. Enthusiasm and faith covered all, excused\r\neverything. But the frightful danger which these theocratic maxims laid\r\nup in store for the future is readily perceived. The Church is armed\r\nwith a sword; excommunication is a sentence of death. There was\r\nhenceforth in the world a power outside that of the State, which\r\ndisposed of the life of citizens.\r\n\r\nPeter had among the apostles a certain precedence, derived directly from\r\nhis zeal and his activity. In these first years he was hardly ever\r\nseparate from John, son of Zebedee. They went almost always together,\r\nand their amity was doubtless the corner-stone of the new faith. James,\r\nthe brother of the Lord, almost equalled them in authority, at least\r\namong a fraction of the Church.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to remark that this little group of simple people had no\r\nspeculative theology. Jesus wisely kept himself far removed from all\r\nmetaphysics. He had only one dogma, his own divine Sonship and the\r\ndivinity of his mission. The whole symbol of the primitive Church might\r\nbe embraced in one line: \"Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God.\" This\r\nbelief rested upon a peremptory argument--the fact of the resurrection,\r\nof which the disciples claimed to be witnesses. To attest the\r\nresurrection of Jesus was the task which all considered as being\r\nspecially imposed upon them. It was, however, very soon put forth that\r\nthe Master had predicted this event. Different sayings of his were\r\nrecalled, which were represented as having not been well understood, and\r\nin which was seen, on second thoughts, an announcement of the\r\nResurrection. The belief in the near glorious manifestation of Jesus was\r\nuniversal. The secret word which the brethren used among themselves, in\r\norder to be recognized and confirmed, was _maran-atha_, \"the Lord is at\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nJesus, with his exquisite tact in religious matters, had instituted no\r\nnew ritual. The new sect had not yet any special ceremonies. The\r\npractices of piety were Jewish. The assemblies had, in a strict sense,\r\nnothing liturgic. They were the meetings of confraternities, at which\r\nprayers were offered up, devoted themselves to _glossolaly_ or prophecy,\r\nand the reading of correspondence. There was nothing yet of\r\nsacerdotalism. There was no priest (_cohen_); the _presbyter_ was the\r\n\"elder,\" nothing more. The only priest was Jesus: in another sense, all\r\nthe faithful were priests. Fasting was considered a very meritorious\r\npractice. Baptism was the token of admission to the sect. The rite was\r\nthe same as administered by John, but it was administered in the name of\r\nJesus. Baptism was, however, considered an insufficient initiation. It\r\nhad to be followed by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which were effected\r\nby means of a prayer, offered up by the apostles, upon the head of the\r\nnew convert, accompanied by the imposition of hands.\r\n\r\nThis imposition of hands, already so familiar to Jesus, was the\r\nsacramental act _par excellence_. It conferred inspiration, universal\r\nillumination, the power to produce prodigies, prophesying, and the\r\nspeaking of languages. It was what was called the Baptism of the Spirit.\r\nIt was supposed to recall a saying of Jesus: \"John baptized you with\r\nwater; but as for you, you shall be baptized by the Spirit.\" Gradually\r\nall these ideas became amalgamated, and baptism was conferred \"in the\r\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\" But it is not\r\nprobable that this formula, in the early days in which we now are, was\r\nyet employed. We see the simplicity of this primitive Christian worship.\r\nNeither Jesus nor the apostles had invented it. Certain Jewish sects had\r\nadopted, before them, these grave and solemn ceremonies, which appeared\r\nto have come in part from Chaldæa, where they are still practised with\r\nspecial liturgies by the Sabeans or Mendaites. The religion of Persia\r\nembraced also many rites of the same description.\r\n\r\nThe beliefs in popular medicine, which constituted a part of the force\r\nof Jesus, were continued in his disciples. The power of healing was one\r\nof the marvellous gifts conferred by the Spirit. The first Christians,\r\nlike almost all the Jews of the time, looked upon diseases as the\r\npunishment of a transgression, or the work of a malignant demon. The\r\napostles passed, just as Jesus did, for powerful exorcists. People\r\nimagined that the anointings of oil administered by the apostles, with\r\nimposition of hands and invocation of the name of Jesus, were\r\nall-powerful to wash away the sins which were the cause of disease, and\r\nto heal the afflicted one. Oil has always been in the East the medicine\r\n_par excellence_. For the rest, the simple imposition of the hands of\r\nthe apostles was reputed to have the same effect. This imposition was\r\nmade by immediate contact. Nor is it impossible that, in certain cases,\r\nthe heat of the hands, being communicated suddenly to the head, insured\r\nto the sick person a little relief.\r\n\r\nThe sect being young and not numerous, the question of deaths was not\r\ntaken into account until later on. The effect caused by the first\r\ndemises which took place in the ranks of the brethren was strange.\r\nPeople were troubled by the manner of the deaths. It was asked whether\r\nthey were less favored than those who were reserved to see with their\r\neyes the advent of the Son of Man? They came generally to consider the\r\ninterval between death and the resurrection as a kind of blank in the\r\nconsciousness of the defunct. At the time of which we speak, belief in\r\nthe resurrection almost alone prevailed. The funeral rite was\r\nundoubtedly the Jewish rite. No importance was attached to it; no\r\ninscription indicated the name of the dead. The great resurrection was\r\nnear; the bodies of the faithful had only to make in the rock a very\r\nshort sojourn. It did not require much persuasion to put people in\r\naccord on the question as to whether the resurrection was to be\r\nuniversal, that is to say, whether it would embrace the good and the\r\nbad, or whether it would apply to the elect only. One of the most\r\nremarkable phenomena of the new religion was the reappearance of\r\nprophecy. For a long time people had spoken but little of prophets in\r\nIsrael. That particular species of inspiration seemed to revive in the\r\nlittle sect. The primitive Church had several prophets and prophetesses\r\nanalogous to those of the Old Testament. The psalmists also reappeared.\r\nThe model of our Christian psalms is without doubt given in the\r\ncanticles which Luke loved to disseminate in his gospel, and which were\r\ncopied from the canticles of the Old Testament. These psalms and\r\nprophecies are, as regards form, destitute of originality, but an\r\nadmirable spirit of gentleness and of piety animates and pervades them.\r\nIt is like a faint echo of the last productions of the sacred lyre of\r\nIsrael. The Book of Psalms was in a measure the calyx from which the\r\nChristian bee sucked its first juice. The Pentateuch, on the contrary,\r\nwas, as it would seem, little read and little studied; there was\r\nsubstituted for it allegories after the manner of the Jewish\r\n_midraschim_ in which all the historic sense of the books was\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nThe music which was sung to the new hymns was probably that species of\r\nsobbing, without distinct notes, which is still the music of the Greek\r\nChurch, of the Maronites, and in general of the Christians of the East.\r\nIt is less a musical modulation than a manner of forcing the voice and\r\nof emitting by the nose a sort of moaning in which all the inflections\r\nfollow each other with rapidity. That odd melopoeia was executed\r\nstanding, with the eyes fixed, the eyebrows crumpled, the brow knit, and\r\nwith an appearance of effort. The word _amen_, in particular, was given\r\nout in a quivering, trembling voice. That word played a great part in\r\nthe liturgy. In imitation of the Jews, the new adherents employed it to\r\nmark the assent of the multitude to the words of the prophet or the\r\nprecentor. People, perhaps, already attributed to it some secret virtues\r\nand pronounced it with a certain emphasis. We do not know whether that\r\nprimitive ecclesiastical song was accompanied by instruments. As to the\r\ninward chant, by which the faithful \"made melody in their hearts,\" and\r\nwhich was but the overflowing of those tender, ardent, pensive souls, it\r\nwas doubtless executed like the _catilenes_ of the Lollards of the\r\nMiddle Ages, in medium voice. In general, it was joyousness which was\r\npoured out in these hymns.\r\n\r\nTill now the Church of Jerusalem presents itself to the outside world as\r\na little Galilean colony. The friends whom Jesus had made at Jerusalem\r\nand in its environs, such as Lazarus, Martha, Mary of Bethany, Joseph of\r\nArimathea, and Nicodemus, had disappeared from the scene. The Galilean\r\ngroup, who pressed around the Twelve, alone remained compact and\r\nactive. The proselytism of the faithful was chiefly carried on by means\r\nof struggling conversions, in which the fervor of their souls was\r\ncommunicated to their neighbors. Their preachings under the porticoes of\r\nSolomon were addressed to circles not at all numerous. But the effect of\r\nthis was only the more profound. Their discourses consisted principally\r\nof quotations from the Old Testament, by which it was sought to prove\r\nthat Jesus was the Messiah.\r\n\r\nThe real preaching was the private conversations of these good and\r\nsincere men; it was the reflection, always noticeable in their\r\ndiscourses, of the words of Jesus; it was, above all, their piety, their\r\ngentleness. The attraction of communistic life carried with it also a\r\ngreat deal of force. Their houses were a sort of hospitals, in which all\r\nthe poor and the forsaken found asylum and succor.\r\n\r\nOne of the first to affiliate himself with the rising society was a\r\nCypriote, named Joseph Hallevi, or the Levite. Like the others, he sold\r\nhis land and carried the price of it to the feet of the Twelve. He was\r\nan intelligent man, with a devotion proof against everything, and a\r\nfluent speaker. The apostles attached him closely to themselves and\r\ncalled him _Barnaba_, that is to say, \"the son of prophecy\" or of\r\n\"preaching.\" He was accounted, in fact, of the number of the prophets,\r\nthat is to say, of the inspired preachers. Later on we shall see him\r\nplay a capital part. Next to St. Paul, he was the most active missionary\r\nof the first century. A certain Mnason, his countryman, was converted\r\nabout the same time. Cyprus possessed many Jews. Barnabas and Mnason\r\nwere undoubtedly Jewish by race. The intimate and prolonged relations of\r\nBarnabas with the Church at Jerusalem induces the belief that\r\nSyro-Chaldaic was familiar to him.\r\n\r\nA conquest, almost as important as that of Barnabas, was that of one\r\nJohn, who bore the Roman surname of Marcus. He was a cousin of Barnabas,\r\nand was circumcised. His mother, Mary, enjoyed an easy competency; she\r\nwas likewise converted, and her dwelling was more than once made the\r\nrendezvous of the apostles. These two conversions appear to have been\r\nthe work of Peter.\r\n\r\nThe first flame was thus spread with great rapidity. The men, the most\r\ncelebrated of the apostolic century, were almost all gained over to the\r\ncause in two or three years, by a sort of simultaneous attraction. It\r\nwas a second Christian generation, similar to that which had been formed\r\nfive or six years previously, upon the shores of Lake Tiberias. This\r\nsecond generation had not seen Jesus, and could not equal the first in\r\nauthority. But it was destined to surpass it in activity and in its love\r\nfor distant missions. One of the best known among the new converts was\r\nStephen, who, before his conversion, appears to have been only a simple\r\nproselyte. He was a man full of ardor and of passion. His faith was of\r\nthe most fervent, and he was considered to be favored with all the gifts\r\nof the Spirit. Philip, who, like Stephen, was a zealous deacon and\r\nevangelist, attached himself to the community about the same time. He\r\nwas often confounded with his namesake, the apostle. Finally, there were\r\nconverted at this epoch, Andronicus and Junia, probably husband and\r\nwife, who, like Aquila and Priscilla, later on, were the model of an\r\napostolic couple, devoted to all the duties of missionary work. They\r\nwere of the blood of Israel, and were in the closest relations with the\r\napostles.\r\n\r\nThe new converts, when touched by grace, were all Jews by religion, but\r\nthey belonged to two very different classes of Jews. The one class was\r\nthe Hebrews; that is to say, the Jews of Palestine, speaking Hebrew or\r\nrather Armenian, reading the Bible in the Hebrew text; the other class\r\nwas \"Hellenists,\" that is to say, Jews speaking Greek, and reading the\r\nBible in Greek. These last were further subdivided into two classes, the\r\none being of Jewish blood, the other being proselytes, that is to say,\r\npeople of non-Israelitish origin, allied in divers degrees to Judaism.\r\nThese Hellenists, who almost all came from Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, or\r\nCyrene, lived at Jerusalem in distinct quarters. They had their separate\r\nsynagogues, and formed thus little communities apart. Jerusalem\r\ncontained a great number of these special synagogues. It was in these\r\nthat the words of Jesus found the soil prepared to receive it and to\r\nmake it fructify.\r\n\r\nThe primitive nucleus of the Church at Jerusalem had been composed\r\nwholly and exclusively of Hebrews; the Aramaic dialect, which was the\r\nlanguage of Jesus, was alone known and employed there. But we see that\r\nfrom the second or third year after the death of Jesus, Greek was\r\nintroduced into the little community, where it soon became dominant. In\r\nconsequence of their daily relations with the new brethren, Peter, John,\r\nJames, Jude, and in general the Galilean disciples acquired the Greek\r\nwith much more facility than if they had already known something of it.\r\nThe Palestinian dialect came to be abandoned from the day in which\r\npeople dreamed of a widespread propaganda. A provincial _patois_, which\r\nwas rarely written, and which was not spoken beyond Syria, was as little\r\nadapted as could be to such an object. Greek, on the contrary, was\r\nnecessarily imposed on Christianity. It was at the time the universal\r\nlanguage, at least for the eastern basin of the Mediterranean. It was,\r\nin particular, the language of the Jews who were dispersed over the\r\nRoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe conversions to Christianity became soon much more numerous among the\r\n\"Hellenists\" than among the \"Hebrews.\" The old Jews at Jerusalem were\r\nbut little drawn toward a sect of provincials, moderately advanced in\r\nthe single science that a Pharisee appreciated--the science of the law.\r\nThe position of the little Church in regard to Judaism was, as with\r\nJesus himself, rather equivocal. But every religious or political party\r\ncarries in itself a force that dominates it, and obliges it, despite\r\nitself, to revolve in its own orbit. The first Christians, whatever\r\ntheir apparent respect for Judaism was, were in reality only Jews by\r\nbirth or by exterior customs. The true spirit of the sect came from\r\nanother source. That which grew out of official Judaism was the\r\n_Talmud_; but Christianity has no affinity with the Talmudic school.\r\nThis is why Christianity found special favor among the parties the least\r\nJewish belonging to Judaism. The rigid orthodoxists took to it but\r\nlittle; it was the newcomers, people scarcely catechized, who had not\r\nbeen to any of the great schools, free from routine, and not initiated\r\ninto the holy tongue, which lent an ear to the apostles and the\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\nThis family of simple and united brethren drew associates from every\r\nquarter. In return for that which these brought, they obtained an\r\nassured future, the society of a congenial brotherhood, and precious\r\nhopes. The general custom, before entering the sect, was for each one to\r\nconvert his fortune into specie. These fortunes ordinarily consisted of\r\nsmall rural, semi-barren properties, and difficult of cultivation. It\r\nhad one advantage, especially for unmarried people: it enabled them to\r\nexchange these plots of land against funds sunk in an assurance society,\r\nwith a view to the Kingdom of God. Even some married people came to the\r\nfore in that arrangement; and precautions were taken to insure that the\r\nassociates brought all that they really possessed, and did not retain\r\nanything outside the common fund. Indeed, seeing that each one received\r\nout of the latter a share, not in proportion to what one put in, but in\r\nproportion to one's needs, every reservation of property was actually a\r\ntheft made upon the community. The Christian communism had religion for\r\na basis, while modern socialism has nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nUnder such a social constitution, the administrative difficulties were\r\nnecessarily very numerous, whatever might be the degree of fraternal\r\nfeeling which prevailed. Between two factions of a community, whose\r\nlanguage was not the same, misapprehensions were inevitable. It was\r\ndifficult for well-descended Jews not to entertain some contempt for\r\ntheir coreligionists who were less noble. In fact, it was not long\r\nbefore murmurs began to be heard. The \"Hellenists,\" who each day became\r\nmore numerous, complained because their widows were not so well treated\r\nat the distributions as those of the \"Hebrews.\" Till now, the apostles\r\nhad presided over the affairs of the treasury. But in face of these\r\nprotestations they felt the necessity of delegating to others this part\r\nof their powers. They proposed to the community to confide these\r\nadministrative cares to seven experienced and considerate men. The\r\nproposition was accepted. The seven chosen were Stephanas, or Stephen,\r\nPhilip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas. Stephen was\r\nthe most important of the seven, and, in a sense, their chief.\r\n\r\nTo the administrators thus designated were given the Syriac name of\r\n_Schammaschin_. They were also sometimes called \"the Seven,\" to\r\ndistinguish them from \"the Twelve.\" Such, then, was the origin of the\r\ndiaconate, which is found to be the most ancient ecclesiastical\r\nfunction, the most ancient of sacred orders. Later, all the organized\r\nchurches, in imitation of that of Jerusalem, had deacons. The growth of\r\nsuch an institution was marvellous. It placed the claims of the poor on\r\nan equality with religious services. It was a proclamation of the truth\r\nthat social problems are the first which should occupy the attention of\r\nmankind. It was the foundation of political economy in the religious\r\nsense. The deacons were the first preachers of Christianity. As\r\norganizers, financiers, and administrators, they filled a yet more\r\nimportant part. These practical men, in constant contact with the poor,\r\nthe sick, the women, went everywhere, observed everything, exhorted, and\r\nwere most efficacious in converting people. They accomplished more than\r\nthe apostles, who remained on their seats of honor at Jerusalem. They\r\nwere the founders of Christianity, in respect of that which it possessed\r\nwhich was most solid and enduring.\r\n\r\nAt an early period women were admitted to this office. They were\r\ndesignated, as in our day, by the name of \"sisters.\" At first widows\r\nwere selected; later, virgins were preferred. The tact which guided the\r\nprimitive Church in all this was admirable. The grand idea of\r\nconsecrating by a sort of religious character and of subjecting to a\r\nregular discipline the women who were not in the bonds of marriage, is\r\nwholly Christian. The term \"widow\" became synonymous with religious\r\nperson, consecrated to God, and, by consequence, a \"deaconess.\" In those\r\ncountries where the wife, at the age of twenty-four, is already faded,\r\nwhere there is no middle state between the infant and the old woman, it\r\nwas a kind of new life, which was created for that portion of the human\r\nspecies the most capable of devotion. These women, constantly going to\r\nand fro, were admirable missionaries of the new religion.\r\n\r\nThe bishop and the priest, as we now know them, did not yet exist.\r\nStill, the pastoral ministry, that intimate familiarity of souls, not\r\nbound by ties of blood, had already been established. This latter has\r\never been the special gift of Jesus, and a kind of heritage from him.\r\nJesus had often said that to everyone he was more than a father and a\r\nmother, and that in order to follow him it was necessary to forsake\r\nthose the most dear to us. Christianity placed some things above\r\nfamily; it instituted brotherhood and spiritual marriage. The ancient\r\nform of marriage, which placed the wife unreservedly in the power of the\r\nhusband, was pure slavery. The moral liberty of the woman began when the\r\nChurch gave to her in Jesus a guide and a confidant, who should advise\r\nand console her, listen always to her, and on occasion counsel\r\nresistance on her part. Woman needs to be governed, and is happy in so\r\nbeing; but it is necessary that she should love him who governs her.\r\nThis is what neither ancient societies nor Judaism nor Islamism have\r\nbeen able to do. Woman has never had, up to the present time, a\r\nreligious conscience, a moral individuality, an opinion of her own,\r\nexcept in Christianity.\r\n\r\nIt was now about the year 36. Tiberius, at Capreæ, has little idea of\r\nthe enemy to the empire which is growing up. In two or three years the\r\nsect had made surprising progress. It numbered several thousand of the\r\nfaithful. It was already easy to foresee that its conquests would be\r\neffected chiefly among the Hellenists and proselytes. The Galilean group\r\nwhich had listened to the Master, though preserving always its\r\nprecedence, seemed as if swamped by the floods of newcomers speaking\r\nGreek. One could already perceive that the principal parts were to be\r\nplayed by the latter. At the time at which we are arrived no pagan, that\r\nis to say, no man without some anterior connection with Judaism, had\r\nentered into the Church. Proselytes, however, performed very important\r\nfunctions in it. The circle _de provenance_ of the disciples had\r\nlikewise largely extended; it is no longer a simple little college of\r\nPalestineans; we can count in it people from Cyprus, Antioch, and\r\nCyrene, and from almost all the points of the eastern coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, where Jewish colonies had been established. Egypt alone\r\nwas wanting in the primitive Church, and for a long time continued to be\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the preachings of the new sect, although\r\ndelivered with so much reserve, should revive the animosities which had\r\naccumulated against its Founder, and eventually brought about his death.\r\nThe Sadducee family of Hanan, who had caused the death of Jesus, was\r\nstill reigning. Joseph Caiaphas occupied, up to 36, the sovereign\r\npontificate, the effective power of which he gave over to his\r\nfather-in-law Hanan, and to his relatives, John and Alexander. These\r\narrogant and pitiless men viewed with impatience a troop of good and\r\nholy people, without official title, winning the favor of the multitude.\r\nOnce or twice Peter, John, and the principal members of the apostolic\r\ncollege were put in prison and condemned to flagellation. This was the\r\nchastisement inflicted on heretics. The authorization of the Romans was\r\nnot necessary in order to apply it. As we might indeed suppose, these\r\nbrutalities only served to inflame the ardor of the apostles. They came\r\nforth from the Sanhedrim, where they had just undergone flagellation,\r\nrejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for Him whom\r\nthey loved. Eternal puerility of penal repressions applied to things of\r\nthe soul! They were regarded, no doubt, as men of order, as models of\r\nprudence and wisdom; these blunderers, who seriously believed in the\r\nyear 36 to gain the upper hand of Christianity by means of a few strokes\r\nof a whip!\r\n\r\nThese outrages proceeded chiefly from the Sadducees, that is to say,\r\nfrom the upper clergy, who crowded the Temple and derived from it\r\nimmense profits. We do not find that the Pharisees exhibited toward the\r\nsect the animosity they displayed to Jesus. The new believers were\r\nstrict and pious people, somewhat resembling in their manner of life the\r\nPharisees themselves. The rage which the latter manifested against the\r\nFounder arose from the superiority of Jesus--a superiority which he was\r\nat no pains to dissimulate. His delicate railleries, his wit, his charm,\r\nhis contempt for hypocrites, had kindled a ferocious hatred. The\r\napostles, on the contrary, were devoid of wit; they never employed\r\nirony. The Pharisees were at times favorable to them; many Pharisees had\r\neven become Christians. The terrible anathemas of Jesus against\r\nPharisaism had not yet been written, and the accounts of the words of\r\nthe Master were neither general nor uniform. These first Christians\r\nwere, besides, people so inoffensive that many persons of the Jewish\r\naristocracy, who did not exactly form part of the sect, were well\r\ndisposed toward them. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, who had known\r\nJesus, remained no doubt with the Church in the bonds of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated Jewish doctor of the age, Rabbi Gamaliel the elder,\r\ngrandson of Hillel, a man of broad and very tolerant ideas, spoke, it is\r\nsaid, in the Sanhedrim in favor of permitting gospel preaching. The\r\nauthor of the Acts credits him with some excellent reasoning, which\r\nought to be the rule of conduct of governments on all occasions when\r\nthey find themselves confronted with novelties of an intellectual or\r\nmoral order. \"If this work is frivolous,\" said he, \"leave it alone--it\r\nwill fall of itself; if it is serious, how dare you resist the work of\r\nGod? In any case, you will not succeed in stopping it.\" Gamaliel's words\r\nwere hardly listened to. Liberal minds in the midst of opposing\r\nfanaticisms have no chance of succeeding.\r\n\r\nA terrible commotion was produced by the deacon Stephen. His preaching\r\nhad, as it would appear, great success. Multitudes flocked around him,\r\nand these gatherings resulted in acrimonious quarrels. It was chiefly\r\nHellenists, or proselytes, _habitués_ of the synagogue, called\r\n_Libertini_, people of Cyrene, of Alexandria, of Cilicia, of Ephesus,\r\nwho took an active part in these disputes. Stephen passionately\r\nmaintained that Jesus was the Messiah, that the priests had committed a\r\ncrime in putting him to death, that the Jews were rebels, sons of\r\nrebels, people who rejected evidence. The authorities resolved to\r\ndespatch this audacious preacher. Several witnesses were suborned to\r\nseize upon some words in his discourses against Moses. Naturally they\r\nfound that for which they sought. Stephen was arrested and led into the\r\npresence of the Sanhedrim. The sentence with which they reproached him\r\nwas almost identical with the one which led to the condemnation of\r\nJesus. They accused him of saying that Jesus of Nazareth would destroy\r\nthe Temple and change the traditions attributed to Moses. It is quite\r\npossible, indeed, that Stephen had used such language. A Christian of\r\nthat epoch could not have had the idea of speaking directly against the\r\nLaw, inasmuch as all still observed it; as for traditions, however,\r\nStephen might combat them as Jesus had himself done; nevertheless, these\r\ntraditions were foolishly ascribed by the orthodox to Moses, and people\r\nattributed to them a value equal to that of the written Law.\r\n\r\nStephen defended himself by expounding the Christian thesis, with a\r\nwealth of citations from the written Law, from the Psalms, from the\r\nProphets, and wound up by reproaching the members of the Sanhedrim with\r\nthe murder of Jesus. \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart,\" said\r\nhe to them, \"you will then ever resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers\r\nalso have done. Which of the prophets have not your fathers prosecuted?\r\nThey have slain those who announced the coming of the Just One, whom you\r\nhave betrayed, and of whom you have been the murderers. This law that\r\nyou have received from the mouth of angels you have not kept.\" At these\r\nwords a scream of rage interrupted him. Stephen, his excitement\r\nincreasing more and more, fell into one of those transports of\r\nenthusiasm which were called the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. His\r\neyes were fixed on high; he witnessed the glory of God, and Jesus by the\r\nside of his Father, and cried out, \"Behold, I see the heavens opened,\r\nand the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of God.\" The whole assembly\r\nstopped their ears and threw themselves upon him, gnashing their teeth.\r\nHe was dragged outside the city and stoned. The witnesses, who,\r\naccording to the law, had to cast the first stones, divested themselves\r\nof their garments and laid them at the feet of a young fanatic named\r\nSaul, or Paul, who was thinking with secret joy of the renown he was\r\nacquiring in participating in the death of a blasphemer.\r\n\r\nIn that epoch the persecutors of Christianity were not Romans; they were\r\northodox Jews. The Romans preserved in the midst of this fanaticism a\r\nprinciple of tolerance and of reason. If we can reproach the imperial\r\nauthority with anything it is with being too lenient, and with not\r\nhaving cut short with a stroke the civil consequences of a sanguinary\r\nlaw which visited with death religious derelictions. But as yet the\r\nRoman domination was not so complete as it became later.\r\n\r\nAs Stephen's death may have taken place at any time during the years 36,\r\n37, 38, we cannot, therefore, affirm whether Caiaphas ought to be held\r\nresponsible for it. Caiaphas was deposed by Lucius Vitellius, in the\r\nyear 36, shortly after the time of Pilate; but the change was\r\ninconsiderable. He had for a successor his brother-in-law, Jonathan, son\r\nof Hanan. The latter, in turn, was succeeded by his brother Theophilus,\r\nson of Hanan, who continued the pontificate in the house of Hanan till\r\nthe year 42. Hanan was still alive, and, possessed of the real power,\r\nmaintained in his family the principles of pride, severity, hatred\r\nagainst innovators, which were, so to speak, hereditary.\r\n\r\nThe death of Stephen produced a great impression. The proselytes\r\nsolemnized his funeral with tears and groanings. The separation of the\r\nnew sectaries from Judaism was not yet absolute. The proselytes and the\r\nHellenists, less strict in regard to orthodoxy than the pure Jews,\r\nconsidered that they ought to render public homage to a man who\r\nrespected their constitution, and whose peculiar beliefs did not put him\r\nwithout the pale of the law. Thus began the era of Christian martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Stephen was not an isolated event. Taking advantage of the\r\nweakness of the Roman functionaries, the Jews brought to bear upon the\r\nChurch a real persecution. It seems that the vexations pressed chiefly\r\non the Hellenists and the proselytes, whose free behavior exasperated\r\nthe orthodox. The Church of Jerusalem, though already strongly\r\norganized, was compelled to disperse. The apostles, according to a\r\nprinciple which seems to have seized strong hold of their minds, did not\r\nquit the city. It was probably so, too, with the whole purely Jewish\r\ngroup, those who were denominated the \"Hebrews.\" But the great community\r\nwith its common table, its diaconal services, its varied exercises,\r\nceased from that time, and was never reformed upon its first model. It\r\nhad endured for three or four years. It was for nascent Christianity an\r\nunequalled good fortune that its first attempts at association,\r\nessentially communistic, were so soon broken up. Essays of this kind\r\nengender such shocking abuses that communistic establishments are\r\ncondemned to crumble away in a very short time or to ignore very soon\r\nthe principle upon which they are founded.\r\n\r\nThanks to the persecution of the year 37, the cenobitic Church of\r\nJerusalem was saved from the test of time. It was nipped in the bud\r\nbefore interior difficulties had undermined it. It remained like a\r\nsplendid dream, the memory of which animated in their life of trial all\r\nthose who had formed part of it, like an ideal to which Christianity\r\nincessantly aspires without ever succeeding in reaching its goal.\r\n\r\nThe leading part in the persecution we have just related belonged to\r\nthat young Saul, whom we have above found abetting, as far as in him\r\nlay, the murder of Stephen. This hot-headed youth, furnished with a\r\npermission from the priests, entered houses suspected of harboring\r\nChristians, laid violent hold on men and women, and dragged them to\r\nprison or before the tribunals. Saul boasted that there was no one of\r\nhis generation so zealous as himself for the traditions. True it is that\r\noften the gentleness and the resignation of his victims astonished him;\r\nhe experienced a kind of remorse; he fancied he heard these pious women,\r\nwhom, hoping for the Kingdom of God, he had cast into prison, saying\r\nduring the night, in a sweet voice, \"Why persecutest thou us?\" The blood\r\nof Stephen, which had almost smothered him, sometimes troubled his\r\nvision. Many things that he had heard said of Jesus went to his heart.\r\nThis superhuman being, in his ethereal life, whence he sometimes\r\nemerged, revealing himself in brief apparitions, haunted him like a\r\nspectre. But Saul shrunk with horror from such thoughts; he confirmed\r\nhimself with a sort of frenzy in the faith of his traditions, and\r\nmeditated new cruelties against those who attacked him. His name had\r\nbecome a terror to the faithful; they dreaded at his hands the most\r\natrocious outrages and the most sanguinary treacheries.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the year 37 had for its result, as is always the\r\ncase, the spread of the doctrine which it was wished to arrest. Till now\r\nthe Christian preaching had not extended far beyond Jerusalem; no\r\nmission had been undertaken; enclosed within its exalted but narrow\r\ncommunion, the mother Church had spread no halos around herself nor\r\nformed any branches. The dispersion of the little circle scattered the\r\ngood seed to the four winds of heaven. The members of the Church of\r\nJerusalem, driven violently from their quarters, spread themselves over\r\nevery part of Judea and Samaria, and preached everywhere the Kingdom of\r\nGod. The deacons, in particular, freed from their administrative\r\nfunctions by the destruction of the community, became excellent\r\nevangelists.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the first missions, which was soon to embrace the whole\r\nbasin of the Mediterranean, was the region about Jerusalem, within a\r\nradius of two or three days' journey. Philip the Deacon was the hero of\r\nthis first holy expedition. He evangelized Samaria most successfully.\r\nPeter and John, after confirming the Church of Sebaste, departed again\r\nfor Jerusalem, evangelizing on their way the villages of the country of\r\nSamaria. Philip the Deacon continued his evangelizing journeys,\r\ndirecting his steps toward the south, into the ancient country of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\nAzote and the Gaza route were the limits of the first evangelical\r\npreachings toward the south. Beyond were the desert and the nomadic life\r\nupon which Christianity has never taken much hold. From Azote Philip the\r\nDeacon turned toward the north and evangelized all the coast as far as\r\nCæsarea, where he settled and founded an important church. Cæsarea was a\r\nnew city and the most considerable of Judea. It was in a kind of way the\r\nport of Christianity, the point by which the Church of Jerusalem\r\ncommunicated with all the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMany other missions, the history of which is unknown to us, were\r\nconducted simultaneously with that of Philip. The very rapidity with\r\nwhich this first preaching was done was the reason of its success. In\r\nthe year 38, five years after the death of Jesus, and probably one year\r\nafter the death of Stephen, all this side of Jordan had heard the glad\r\ntidings from the mouths of missionaries hailing from Jerusalem. Galilee,\r\non its part, guarded the holy seed and probably scattered it around her,\r\nalthough we know of no missions issuing from that quarter. Perhaps the\r\ncity of Damascus, from the period at which we now are, had also some\r\nChristians, who received the faith from Galilean preachers.\r\n\r\nThe year 38 is marked in the history of the nascent Church by a much\r\nmore important conquest. During that year we may safely place the\r\nconversion of that Saul whom we witnessed participating in the stoning\r\nof Stephen, and as a principal agent in the persecution of 37, but who\r\nnow, by a mysterious act of grace, becomes the most ardent of the\r\ndisciples of Jesus.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 38 to the year 44 no persecution seems to have been\r\ndirected against the Church. The faithful were, no doubt, far more\r\nprudent than before the death of Stephen, and avoided speaking in\r\npublic. Perhaps, too, the troubles of the Jews who, during all the\r\nsecond part of the reign of Caligula, were at variance with that prince,\r\ncontributed to favor the nascent sect.\r\n\r\nThis period of peace was fruitful in interior developments. The nascent\r\nChurch was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, Galilee, to\r\nwhich Damascus was no doubt attached. The primacy of Jerusalem was\r\nuncontested. The Church of this city, which had been dispersed after the\r\ndeath of Stephen, was quickly reconstituted. The apostles had never\r\nquitted the city. The brothers of the Lord continued to reside there and\r\nto wield a great authority.\r\n\r\nPeter undertook frequent apostolical journeys in the environs of\r\nJerusalem. He had always a great reputation as a thaumaturgist. At Lydda\r\nin particular he was reputed to have cured a paralytic named Æneas, a\r\nmiracle which is said to have led to numerous conversions in the plain\r\nof Saron. From Lydda he repaired to Joppa, a city which appears to have\r\nbeen a centre for Christianity. Peter made a long sojourn at Joppa, at\r\nthe house of a tanner named Simon, who dwelt near the sea. The\r\norganization of works of charity was soon actively entered upon.\r\n\r\nThe germ of those associations of women, which are one of the glories of\r\nChristianity, existed in the first churches of Judea. At Jaffa commenced\r\nthose societies of veiled women, clothed in linen, who were destined to\r\ncontinue through centuries the tradition of charitable secrets. Tabitha\r\nwas the mother of a family which will have no end as long as there are\r\nmiseries to be relieved and feminine instincts to be gratified.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Jerusalem was still exclusively composed of Jews and of\r\nproselytes. The Holy Ghost being shed upon the uncircumcised before\r\nbaptism, appeared an extraordinary fact. It is probable that there\r\nexisted thenceforward a party opposed in principle to the admission of\r\nGentiles, and that all did not accept the explanations of Peter. The\r\nauthor of the Acts would have us believe that the approbation was\r\nunanimous. But in a few years we shall see the question revived with\r\nmuch greater intensity. This matter of the good centurion was, perhaps,\r\nlike that of the Ethiopian eunuch, accepted as an exceptional case,\r\njustified by a revelation and an express order from God. Still the\r\nmatter was far from being settled. This was the first controversy which\r\nhad taken place in the bosom of the Church; the paradise of interior\r\npeace had lasted for six or seven years.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 40 the great question upon which depended all the future\r\nof Christianity appears thus to have been propounded. Peter and Philip\r\ntook a very just view of what was the true solution, and baptized\r\npagans.\r\n\r\nThe new faith was spread from place to place with marvellous rapidity.\r\nThe members of the Church of Jerusalem, who had been dispersed\r\nimmediately after the death of Stephen, pushing their conquests along\r\nthe coast of Phoenicia, reached Cyprus and Antioch. They were at first\r\nguided by the sole principle of preaching the Gospel to the Jews only.\r\n\r\nAntioch, \"the metropolis of the East,\" the third city of the world, was\r\nthe centre of this Christian movement in Northern Syria. It was a city\r\nwith a population of more than five hundred thousand souls, and the\r\nresidence of the imperial legate of Syria. Suddenly advanced to a high\r\ndegree of splendor by the Seleucidæ, it reaped great benefit from the\r\nRoman occupation. Antioch, from its foundation, had been wholly a\r\nGrecian city. The Macedonians of Antigone and Seleucus had brought with\r\nthem into that country of the Lower Orontes their most lively\r\nrecollections, their worship, and the names of their country. The\r\nGrecian mythology was there adopted as it were in a second home; they\r\npretended to show in the country a crowd of \"holy places\" forming part\r\nof this mythology. The city was full of the worship of Apollo and of the\r\nnymphs. The degradation of the people was awful. The peculiarity of\r\nthese centres of moral putrefaction is to reduce all the race of mankind\r\nto the same level. The depravity of certain Levantine cities, which are\r\ndominated by the spirit of intrigue and delivered up entirely to low\r\ncunning, can scarcely give us an idea of the degree of corruption\r\nreached by the human race at Antioch. It was an inconceivable medley of\r\nmountebanks, quacks, buffoons, magicians, miracle-mongers, sorcerers,\r\nfalse priests; a city of races, games, dances, processions, _fêtes_,\r\nrevels, of unbridled luxury, of all the follies of the East, of the most\r\nunhealthy superstitions, and of the fanaticism of the orgy. The city\r\nwas very literary, but literary only in the literature of rhetoricians.\r\nThe beauty of works of art and the infinite charm of nature prevented\r\nthis moral degradation from sinking entirely into hideousness and\r\nvulgarity.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Antioch owed its foundation to some believers originally\r\nfrom Cyprus and Cyrene, who had already been much engaged in preaching.\r\nUp to this time they had only addressed themselves to the Jews. But in a\r\ncity where pure Jews--Jews who were proselytes, \"people fearing God\"--or\r\nhalf-Jewish pagans and pure pagans, lived together, exclusive preaching\r\nrestricted to a group of houses became impossible. That feeling of\r\nreligious aristocracy on which the Jews of Jerusalem so much prided\r\nthemselves did not exist in those large cities, where civilization was\r\naltogether of the profane sort, where the scope was greater, and where\r\nprejudices were less firmly rooted. The Cypriot and Cyrenian\r\nmissionaries were then constrained to depart from their rule. They\r\npreached to the Jews and to the Greeks indifferently.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Christian preaching was great. A young, innovating,\r\nand ardent Church, full of the future, because it was composed of the\r\nmost diverse elements, was quickly founded. All the gifts of the Holy\r\nSpirit were there poured out, and it was easy to perceive that this new\r\nChurch, emancipated from the strict Mosaism which erected an insuperable\r\nbarrier around Jerusalem, would become the second cradle of\r\nChristianity. Assuredly, Jerusalem must remain forever the capital of\r\nthe Christian world; nevertheless, the point of departure of the Church\r\nof the Gentiles, the primordial focus of Christian missions, was, in\r\ntruth, Antioch. It was there that for the first time a Christian church\r\nwas established, freed from the bonds of Judaism; it was there that the\r\ngreat propaganda of the apostolic age was established; it was there that\r\nSt. Paul assumed a definite character. Antioch marks the second\r\nhalting-place of the progress of Christianity, and, in respect of\r\nChristian nobility, neither Rome nor Alexandria nor Constantinople can\r\nbe at all compared with it.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Christianity, from this point of view, is the greatest\r\nwork that the men of the people have ever achieved. Very quickly,\r\nwithout doubt, men and women of the high Roman nobility joined\r\nthemselves to the Church. At the end of the first century, Flavius\r\nClemens and Flavia Domitilla show us Christianity penetrating almost\r\ninto the palace of the Cæsars.\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC M. WISE\r\n\r\nIn the rabbinical literature several successes of the apostles are\r\nnoticed, especially at Capernaum and Capersamia. One of them is most\r\nremarkable, viz., the conversion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcan by the\r\napostle James. This rabbi, the _Talmud_ narrates, was actually arrested\r\nby Roman officers, and, in obedience to the edict against Christianity,\r\nwas accused of the crime of being a Christian, which he did not deny,\r\nalthough he repented it.\r\n\r\nThe most important success, however, which the apostles could boast was\r\nthe conversion of Paul. The man whose colossal genius and gigantic\r\nenergies grasped the pillars upon which the superstructure of\r\nGræco-Roman paganism rested, bent and broke them like rotten staves,\r\ntill with a thundering noise down came the ancient fabric, with its\r\ngods, altars, temples, priests, and priestesses, depositing _débris_\r\nthat took centuries to remove and remodel; the man whose hands were\r\nagainst all, and against whom were all hands; who defied the philosophy\r\nof the philosophers, the power of the priests, and the religions of the\r\nworld; who was all alone all in all--this man was Paul of Tarsus, the\r\ngreat apostle to the Gentiles, with an original gospel of his own. He\r\nkindled a fire in the very heart of the Roman Empire, under the eyes of\r\nthe authorities of Rome and of Jerusalem, which in a few centuries\r\nconsumed ancient heathenism from the Tigris to the Tiber, and from the\r\nTiber to the Thames. With a skilful hand he threw the sparks upon the\r\naccumulated combustibles of error, corruption, and slavery, and ancient\r\nsociety exploded, to make room and furnish the material for a new\r\ncivilization. The conversion of this man was the apostles' great\r\nsuccess. If it had not been for him the nascent Church, like other\r\nJewish sects, would have perished in the catastrophe of Jerusalem,\r\nbecause the apostles did not possess that vigor and energy to resist the\r\nviolent shock. In Paul, however, the spirit of John and of Jesus\r\nresurrected with double vigor, and he became the actual founder of the\r\nChristianity of history.\r\n\r\nFew and far apart are the brilliant stars in the horizon of history.\r\nStrike out a hundred names and their influence upon the fate of man, and\r\nyou have no history.\r\n\r\nThose brilliant stars, however, did not always make history from their\r\nown wealth, from the original resources of their minds. Ideas which tens\r\nof thousands have held, without an attempt to carry them into effect,\r\nand others have unsuccessfully attempted to realize, in the right time\r\nand under favorable circumstances are seized upon by an executive\r\ngenius, and a new epoch in history is opened. The numerous minor spirits\r\nwhich contributed to the sum total of the creative idea disappear in the\r\nbrilliancy of the one star which remains visible in history. The world\r\nis a machine shop. Each artificer makes the part of a machine. One\r\nmaster mind combines the parts, and he is known as the master machinist.\r\n\r\nPaul was one of those master machinists, one of those brilliant stars in\r\nthe horizon of history. In him the spirit of Jesus resurrected as\r\neminently and vigorously as John had resurrected in Jesus. He was the\r\nauthor of Gentile Christianity. He conceived the idea of carrying into\r\neffect what all the prophets, all pious Israelites of all ages, hoped\r\nand expected--the denationalization of the Hebrew ideas, and their\r\npromulgation in the form of universal religion among the Gentiles; to\r\nconciliate and unite the human family under the great banner inscribed\r\nwith the motto of \"One God and one code of morals to all.\" All Jews of\r\nall ages hoped and expected that the kingdom of heaven should be\r\nextended to all nations and tongues; but Paul went forth TO DO it; this\r\nis his particular greatness.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances, of course, favored his enterprise. Græco-Roman\r\npaganism was undermined. The gods stood in disrepute, and the augurs\r\nsmiled. The state religion was an organized hypocrisy. The learned\r\nbelieved nothing; the vulgar almost everything, if it was but\r\npreposterously absurd enough. The progress of Grecian philosophy and the\r\ninroads of Judaism in the Roman world were so considerable that royal\r\nfamilies had embraced Judaism, and the emperor Tiberius had found it\r\nnecessary to drive the Jews, together with the Egyptian priests, from\r\nRome, because their religion had its admirers in the very palace of the\r\nCæsars, as well as among priests, nobles, and plebeians. All the devout\r\nGentiles whom Paul met on his journeys were Judaized Greeks or Syrians;\r\nfor the Pharisees traversed land and sea to make one proselyte.\r\nTherefore, when Paul preached in Asia Minor, Cicero and Cato _had_\r\nspoken in Rome; Seneca and Epictetus gave utterance to sentiments as\r\nnearly like those of Paul and other Jews as are the two eyes of the same\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the other hand, Epicurism in its worst sequences, sensualism\r\nin its most outrageous form, the despotism and brutality of the Cæsars\r\nand their favorites, had so undermined the moral sentiments and\r\nreligious feelings of the masses that scepticism, fraught with shocking\r\nvices and unnatural crimes, coupled with contemptible hypocrisy and\r\nridiculous superstition, demoralized the masses and brought truth itself\r\ninto ill-repute. To add to all this there came the steady decline of the\r\nJewish state, the growing demonstration of fast-approaching ruin, and,\r\nin consequence thereof, the growth of superstition among the Hebrews,\r\namong whom a class of mystics sprang up, who professed to know what God\r\nand his angels do, speak, and think in the secret cabinet of heaven,\r\nwhere the throne of the Almighty stands, splendidly and minutely\r\ndescribed by those mystics who supposed that they received superior\r\nknowledge by special impressions from on high, without study or research\r\non their part; and expected to see the status of social and political\r\naffairs suddenly changed by miraculous interpositions of the Deity,\r\nwithout human exertion and coöperation. This state of affairs was highly\r\nfavorable to Paul's stupendous enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut who was Paul himself? Notwithstanding all the attempts of the author\r\nof the Acts to mystify him into as mythical a character as the Gospels\r\nmade of Jesus, Paul is an open book in history. We have his genuine\r\nepistles, in which he gives considerable account of himself and his\r\nexploits. We have one portion of the Acts in which, contrary to the rest\r\nof that book, the author narrates in the first person plural, \"we,\"\r\nwhich appears to be taken from the notes of one of Paul's\r\ncompanions--Luke, Timothy, Silas, or any other. Then we have the\r\n_Talmud_, with its numerous anecdotes about _Acher_, as the rabbis\r\ncalled Paul, which are of inestimable value to the historian. These\r\nsources enable us to form a conception of the man. A few remarks on his\r\nlife will be found interesting.\r\n\r\nPaul is not a proper name. It signifies \"the little one.\" The author of\r\nthe Acts states that his name was Saul. But, it appears, he knew no more\r\nabout it than we do, and changed the P of Paul into an S, to make of it\r\nthe Hebrew name Saul. In his epistles he invariably calls himself Paul,\r\nand not Saul. So the author of the \"we\" portion of the Acts always calls\r\nhim Paul. Passing under an assumed name, the rabbis called him _Acher_,\r\n\"another,\" _i.e._, one who passes under another or assumed name. They\r\nmaintain that his name was Elisha ben Abujah. But this name must be\r\nfictitious, because it is a direct and express reference to Paul's\r\ntheology. It signifies \"the saving deity, son of the father god,\" and\r\nPaul was the author of the \"Son of God\" doctrine. The fact is, he was\r\nknown to the world under his assumed name only.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of his youth, except a few spurious anecdotes recorded\r\nin the _Talmud_. When quite young he studied the law and some Grecian\r\nliterature at the feet of Gamaliel in Jerusalem, among the thousand\r\nstudents who listened to the wisdom of that master. He states that he\r\nwas a very zealous Pharisee, who persecuted the Christians. But all of a\r\nsudden he embraced the cause of the persecuted, and became one of its\r\nmost zealous apostles. We can easily imagine the nature of that\r\npersecution, although the Stephen story, like the Damascus story and the\r\nvision on the way, as narrated in the Acts, is spurious, because Paul\r\nnever alludes to it, and the Jews of Jerusalem had no jurisdiction in\r\nDamascus over anybody. But what caused his remarkable transition from\r\none extreme to the other? First a Pharisee, with law and nothing but\r\nlaw, and then the author of the epistles, which reject and abrogate the\r\nentire law. Transitions of this nature require time, and are wrought by\r\nviolent agencies only.\r\n\r\nA number of stories narrated in the _Talmud_, together with those of the\r\nActs, point to the fact that the youthful Paul, with his vivid\r\nimagination, witnessed many an act of barbarous violence and outrageous\r\ninjustice. Occurrences of this nature were not rare under the military\r\ndespotism of Rome in Judea. The soil was saturated with innocent blood.\r\nThe world was governed by the sword, and Rome groaned under the\r\nunnatural crimes of her Cæsars. There was universal depravity among the\r\ngoverning class, and endless misery among the governed. The rabbis give\r\nus to understand that this state of affairs misled Paul into the belief\r\nthat there was no justice in heaven or earth, no hope for Israel, no\r\nreward and no punishment, that the balance of justice was destroyed. It\r\nis quite natural that under such circumstances such a scepticism should\r\noverpower young and sensitive reasoners.\r\n\r\nKing Saul, in a state of despair, receiving no reply from the prophets,\r\nnone from the Urim and Thumim, deeply fallen as he was, went in disguise\r\nto the Witch of Endor. Goethe's Faust, in imitation thereof, receiving\r\nno answer to his questions addressed to heaven and eternity, no answer\r\nthrough his knowledge of nature's laws and nature's forces, no answer\r\nfrom the philosophy of his century and the theology of his priests,\r\nthrows himself into the embrace of Mephistopheles. That is human nature.\r\nExactly the same thing was done in the days of Paul, and exactly the\r\nsame thing he himself did. There was the indescribable misery of the\r\nage, and there were the knowledge and theories of that overburdened\r\ncentury, and no answer, no reply to the questions addressed to heaven\r\nand eternity; and they went to the fountains of mysticism and secret\r\nknowledge to quench the thirst of the soul. There sprung up the\r\nvisionary Gnostics among the Gentiles, and the Cabalistic Mystics among\r\nthe Jews. History notices the same rotation continually--idealism,\r\nsensualism, scepticism, and finally mysticism.\r\n\r\nThe mystic art among the Hebrews then was of two different kinds, either\r\nto attract an evil spirit or to be transported alive into paradise or\r\nheaven. An evil spirit was attracted by fasting and remaining for days\r\nand nights alone in burial-grounds, till the brain was maddened and\r\ninfatuated, when the artificial demoniac prophesied and performed sundry\r\nmiracles. The transportation to heaven or paradise was more difficult.\r\nThe candidate for a tour into heaven would retire to some isolated\r\nspot, fast until the brain was maddened with delirium and the nerves\r\nexcited to second sight by the loss of sleep. Then, in that state of\r\ntrance, he would sit down on the ground, draw up his knees, bend down\r\nhis head between them, and murmur magic spells, until, through the\r\nreversed circulation of the blood, the maddened brain, and the unstrung\r\nnerves, he would imagine that he saw the heaven opening to his\r\ninspection, palace after palace thrown widely open to his gaze, hosts of\r\nangels passing within view, until finally he imagined himself entirely\r\nremoved from the earth, transported aloft into those diamond palaces on\r\nhigh, or, as Paul calls it, \"caught up into paradise,\" where he heard\r\n\"unspeakable words, which it is not possible for a man to utter,\" and\r\nthe throne of God, with all the seraphim and cherubim, archangels and\r\nangels, became visible and their conversation intelligible to the\r\nenraptured and transported mystic, in a fit of hallucination, when the\r\nbewildered imagination sees objectively its own subjective phantasma,\r\nand hears from without, in supposed articulate sounds, its own silent\r\nthoughts. It requires no great stretch of the imagination to form a\r\ncorrect idea of the mystic eccentricities to which this awful practice\r\nmust have led those who frequently indulged in it. Rabbinical mystics,\r\nlike modern trance-speakers, gave vivid descriptions of the interior\r\nsplendor and grand sceneries of heaven and of the conversations of\r\nangels. One of those descriptions is preserved in _Pirke Rabbi Eliezer_,\r\nand others in various fragments of the _Talmud_.\r\n\r\nAmong those particularly noticed in the _Talmud_ as having been in\r\nheaven or paradise there is also Acher, or Paul, who states so himself\r\nin his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (xii.). That passage gave rise\r\nto the story of Jesus appearing in person to Paul, just as the\r\nrabbinical mystics claimed to have had frequent intercourse with the\r\nprophet Elijah, who had been transported alive to heaven.\r\n\r\nSo Paul passed the transition from the law school of the Pharisees to\r\nthe new school of mystics. In this state of trance he discovered that\r\ncentral figure of the Cabalistic speculation, the _Metathron_, the\r\nco-regent of the Almighty; or, as he otherwise was called, the\r\n_Synadelphos_, the _confrère_ of the Deity, or Suriel, the \"Prince of\r\nthe Countenance,\" whom the Cabalists imagined to be the chief marshal\r\nor chief scribe in heaven; who was once on earth, as Enoch or as Elijah,\r\nand was advanced to that high position in heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is the Demiurge, the highest magistrate in heaven, whom the gnostic\r\nValentine calls a godlike angel, and of whom the rabbis said, \"His name\r\nis like unto the name of his Master.\"\r\n\r\nThis central figure, blended with the messianic speculations of that\r\nage, with the doctrines of Peter and the nascent Church, combined in\r\nPaul's mind to one mystic conception of the \"Son of God,\" intelligible\r\nto pagan ears. So he went forth and proclaimed Jesus of Nazareth the Son\r\nof God. In substance, the expression is about the same as Metathron and\r\nSynadelphos, and the office which Paul ascribed to Jesus is precisely of\r\nthe same nature with that which the Cabalists ascribed to the angel who\r\nwas the _Saar Haolom_, the prince or ruler of this world, who stands\r\nbefore God, or also sits before him, as Paul's Jesus stands before God\r\nor sits at his right hand. It is precisely the same in both systems, the\r\nnames only are changed; so that it is difficult to decide whether Paul\r\nwas or the rabbis were the authors of the metathronic speculations,\r\nespecially as these two angels only have Greek names, while all others\r\nare Hebrew or Chaldæan, and later Cabalists frequently put down Joshua\r\nor Jesus in the place of Metathron.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that Acher's dualism of the Deity was the Persian\r\n_Ormuzd_ and _Ahriman_, hence a good and an evil principle, and that\r\nMetathron never was an evil demon, are as decidedly mistaken as those\r\nwho believe that Paul had more than one God. Paul's Son of God and\r\nAcher's Metathron are the same central figure before the throne of God,\r\nand the two authors are identical.\r\n\r\nIn that world of secret thoughts Paul discovered the harmonization of\r\ndiscordant speculations and the remedy for all existing evils. \"The\r\nworld must be regenerated by a new religion,\" was his great ideal. The\r\nancient religions and the philosophies have produced the corruption\r\nwhich rages universally. They must be swept away. Society must be\r\nreconstructed on a new basis, and this basis is in the theology and\r\nethics of Israel, separated and liberated from their climatical and\r\nnational limitations, their peculiar Jewish garb. There was no hope\r\nleft of saving the Jewish nationality and political organization from\r\nthe hands of omnipotent Rome, which swallowed and neutralized kingdoms\r\nand nations with wonderful ease; nor was there any particular necessity\r\nfor it if society at large was reconstructed on the new basis. The\r\nobject of Jesus was to reconstruct the kingdom of heaven _in Israel_,\r\nand he was crucified. All Israel had the same object in view, and stood\r\nat the brink of dissolution. If the basis and principles of the kingdom\r\nof heaven became the postulate of society at large, Jesus is resurrected\r\nin the world, and Israel is saved, was Paul's main idea.\r\n\r\nThe Pharisean rabbis hoped that this would come to pass at some future\r\nday, when, they maintained, all sacrifices and all laws would be\r\nabolished, and all the nations of the earth would be one family, with\r\none God and one moral law. Paul seized upon the idea, and added to it\r\nthe simple dogma of Peter, \"The Messiah has come.\" That hoped-for future\r\nis now. God's promise to Abraham, \"And there shall be blessed by thee,\r\nand by thy seed, all the families of the earth,\" is to be fulfilled at\r\nonce. So he came forth from his mystical paradise an apostle of Jesus\r\nand a new redeemer of Israel. He argued exactly as the Pharisean doctors\r\ndid who maintained that the Messiah would come when all mankind should\r\nbe guilty or all righteous. In the estimation of Paul, at that\r\nparticular time all mankind was corrupt and demoralized, and so that was\r\nthe time for the Messiah to make his appearance.\r\n\r\nHe went to work at once. He began to preach his new Christianity at\r\nDamascus about the year 51, and found out that the world was not\r\nprepared for his ideas. He had a narrow escape at Damascus, where the\r\ngovernor and soldiers pursued him. Like the spies at Jericho, he was let\r\ndown in a basket over the city walls and made his escape. So _he_\r\nnarrates the story. The author of the Acts, true to his hostility to the\r\nJews, of course brings them in as the persecutors. But Paul, in general,\r\nnever speaks otherwise than with the highest regard and love of his\r\nkinsmen and his brothers according to the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe failure at Damascus did not discourage Paul. It only convinced him\r\nthat he was too young--he could not at that time have been much over\r\ntwenty-one years; that he was not sufficiently prepared for the great\r\nenterprise; that it was not such an easy task to throw down the\r\nsuperannuated heathenism and to reorganize society on a new basis. He\r\nretired into Arabia and remained there nearly three years, to perfect a\r\nplan of operation. Nearly three years he spent in silent contemplation,\r\nto discover the proper means, to take the right hold upon the heathen\r\nworld, and to unfurl a new banner of heaven upon this wicked earth. In\r\n53 or 54 we meet him again at Antioch, with his new and original\r\ngospel--the gospel for the Gentiles--prepared for his mission and ready\r\nto embark in the great enterprise, to wage active war upon all existing\r\nsystems of religion and philosophy, and to replace all of them by Paul's\r\ngospel. He had been in Jerusalem fifteen days, had conversed with Peter\r\nand nobody else, but he repeatedly tells us that he had taken advice of\r\nnone, consulted none, was appointed by nobody, and learned nothing of\r\nanybody. The gospel was his gospel, and he was an apostle by the\r\nappointment of God Almighty himself, who had revealed his Son to him. In\r\nAntioch he established the first congregation of Jews and Gentiles, and\r\ncalled them Christians. So Paul was the actual author of Christianity\r\namong the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nWhat was Paul's gospel? Paul, setting out on his journeys with the great\r\nidea of converting heathens, was obliged to paganize the Gospel. The\r\nheathens knew nothing of the Jewish Messiah, and he gave him the name\r\npopularly known among them--he called him the Son of God, which was a\r\ncommon name in mythology. The Son of God and Mary was a term as popular\r\namong heathens as it was foreign to the Jews, among whom Jesus was to\r\nremain the Messiah, only that he became also the Metathron. This\r\nexplained to Jewish mystics the possibility of the second advent, and\r\ngave a metaphysical foundation to the resurrection doctrine. The kingdom\r\nof heaven, or the theocracy, was another unintelligible idea to the\r\nheathen. Israel's laws and form of government were as odious and decried\r\namong the pagans as the hostility to that people was fierce and\r\nimplacable. Paul made thereof a theological kingdom of heaven, when all\r\nthe dead shall resurrect in spiritual bodies, and the living shall be\r\nchanged accordingly, together with this earth and all that is thereon;\r\nand declared all the laws of Israel abrogated, so that only the spirit\r\nthereof, the precepts and not the laws, should be obligatory in the new\r\nstate of society.\r\n\r\nThe sins and wickedness of the world are forgiven to all who believe in\r\nthe Son, and whose flesh is crucified with him, to resurrect with him in\r\npurity; for he died a vicarious atonement for all. He was the last\r\nsacrifice, to blot out the sins of all who have faith in him.\r\n\r\nThe Crucified One did not resurrect merely in the spirit, of which the\r\nheathens could not form a satisfactory conception, because the\r\nimmortality of the soul was by no means a general belief among them, and\r\ntheir gods were no spirits; he resurrected in his very body, and was\r\ncaught up to heaven, to sit or stand there at God's right hand, to come\r\ndown again in proper time. \"Here, then, is your tangible proof of\r\nimmortality,\" he said to the heathens. \"Like the Crucified One, all of\r\nyou will resurrect from the dead, or be changed on the day of judgment.\"\r\nThis was plain language to heathens, who knew that but lately Cæsar had\r\nbeen caught up to heaven as Romulus was before him, and asked no\r\nquestions as to how a human body can rise in the atmosphere and become\r\nincorruptible; none as to what means above or below, up or down, as to\r\nwhere God is and where he is not, where his right hand, where before and\r\nwhere behind him; or as to whether the world is full of his glory. No\r\nsuch questions were asked, and there was the ocular demonstration of\r\nimmortality, tangible and intelligible to the grossest intellect.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish nationality and the Jewish law are at their end, and the\r\nworld is the heir to that covenant and to the blessing of God by Abraham\r\nand his seed. With the new covenant the old one ceases. It has fulfilled\r\nits destiny. It was a state of preparation for this period of universal\r\nsalvation to all who have love, hope, and faith. With Adam and the flesh\r\ncame the sin, law, and death; with Jesus the flesh ceases, hence no more\r\nsin, law, or death.\r\n\r\nThese are the main features of Paul's gospel: The Son of God, the\r\ntheological kingdom of heaven, the vicarious atonement, the bodily\r\nresurrection of the Crucified One, the abrogation of the law, and the\r\nbeginning of the new covenant. He was the first man to utter these\r\ndoctrines; with him Christianity begins, and he named it.\r\n\r\nBut Paul knew well that doctrines alone would be insufficient to rouse\r\nthe heathen world from its demoralized state, its dreary and stupid\r\ndreams; and he resorted to the most terrible and most shocking of all\r\nmessages. He came to the heathens with the terror-striking proclamation,\r\n\"The end is nigh!\" The whole earth, with all the creatures thereon; the\r\nwhole human family, with all its wickedness, all its atrocious crimes,\r\nwill be destroyed in one moment. All of you, men, women, and children,\r\nwith all your vices and crimes, will be suddenly summoned before the\r\nEternal and All-just; you have to go, all of you, and appear before the\r\nomniscient God. The end is nigh, the destruction of the human family is\r\ncertain and right before you. It will come soon. It may come any day, at\r\nany moment.\r\n\r\nNow Paul's gospel came in. Here is your choice. There are death and\r\ndamnation; here are life and happiness everlasting. God has sent his Son\r\nin advance of the approaching catastrophe to warn you, and he is\r\nappointed now to conduct the end of all flesh. Cling to him and be\r\nsaved, or believe not and be condemned forever. So he came to the\r\nheathens. This was his gospel. How did he succeed? We will explain after\r\na brief pause.\r\n\r\nAll passages in the Gospels and the Acts which have reference to the\r\nabove Christology, to the end of things or against it--in which the\r\nsynoptics most fatally contradict one another--are the products of\r\nwriters long after Paul, when the attempts to reconcile Jewish and\r\nGentile Christianity were made. For with Paul begins the new form of\r\nChristianity and the struggle with the representatives of the old form.\r\nWithin ten years he traversed the land from Antioch to Athens, in three\r\ndifferent journeys, and established his bishopric, the first Christian\r\ncongregations among the Gentiles. He organized them fully, with deacons\r\nand deaconesses, preachers and prophets; and he was their bishop, their\r\noracle, their revelation, and their demi-god. He let his converts\r\nbelieve that they could do wonderful things, in healing the sick,\r\ndriving out demons, prophesying and speaking with strange tongues,\r\nbecause it served his purposes, although he did none of these things. He\r\ngave them the Holy Ghost, _i.e._, he regenerated their feelings and\r\npacified their stormy passions, suppressed their brutal lusts, and\r\nelevated their aspirations to higher ideals. He did not feel that\r\nsovereign contempt for money which the Master did whom he glorified; for\r\nhe, like the other apostles, took his pay, and argued with the\r\nCorinthians, like a good Pharisean lawyer, that bishops and preachers\r\nmust be paid--an argument well understood by the dignitaries of the\r\nChurch to this day.\r\n\r\nWonderful, indeed, is the progress which Paul made among the Gentiles in\r\nten years. Like a pillar of fire, he traversed the deserts of\r\nheathenism; like a second Elijah, he battled against the priests and\r\nprophets of Baal, and conjured down the fire from heaven to his\r\nassistance. Within ten years he laid the foundation of a new\r\ncivilization, of the reorganization of society on the new basis. He did\r\nnot live to see it realized, but he saw the new system take root and\r\npromise golden fruit. Wonderful, we maintain, was his success; for he\r\nwas not only opposed by the entire heathen world, and by the orthodox\r\nJews, although he proclaimed their God and their doctrines, their\r\nreligion and their hopes, but was also most strenuously opposed by the\r\napostles and the nascent congregation in Jerusalem, whose Master he\r\nglorified, and whose cause he made the cause of the world. The\r\ndissensions between Paul and the apostles were of a very serious\r\ncharacter, and there was ample cause for them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he took it upon himself to be an apostle, and they\r\nhad their college of Twelve, to which none could be added, especially\r\nnot Paul, who had never seen Jesus of Nazareth. He maintained that God\r\nhad appointed him, God had revealed his Son and his Gospel to him; but\r\nthe apostles did not believe it, and never acknowledged him as an\r\napostle. At the end of his journeys, Peter, James, and John, three out\r\nof Twelve, acknowledged him as an apostle to the Gentiles, but not to\r\nthe Jews. The rest never did, which, of course, was a great trouble and\r\ndrawback to Paul among his own converts.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, they could never forgive him for the idea of going\r\nto the Gentiles. Peter, who had become a pious Essene and considered it\r\nunlawful to go to the house or into the company of a Gentile; James, who\r\ndreaded the idea of eating of the bread of the Gentile, and made a\r\nhypocrite in this point of Peter at Antioch--and they were the heads of\r\nthe Church--could not forgive Paul's innovation in going to the\r\nGentiles. Paul was sensible enough to silence them by begging money for\r\nthem, and to appoint the Sunday for collections to be made for the\r\nsaints of Jerusalem. But it was too much for them that Paul went to the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, he changed their whole religion into a new sort of\r\nmythology. He made of Jesus a Son of God, of which they had no\r\nknowledge. He preached vicarious atonement, bodily resurrection, the end\r\nof the old covenant and the beginning of a new, the end of all flesh,\r\nthe last judgment--all of which was foreign to them; not one word of all\r\nthat had their Master told them, and they knew only what he did tell\r\nthem. They naturally looked upon him as an unscrupulous innovator. They\r\nhad not experience and forethought enough to understand that Paul's\r\nsuccess among the heathens depended on that means. They were pious men\r\nwho prayed much, believed seriously, and had no knowledge of the world\r\nas it was.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, they could not possibly give their consent to\r\nPaul's abrogation of the whole law, knowing, as they did, how their\r\nMaster respected every tittle, every iota of the law; that he had come\r\nto fulfil the law, and to reëstablish the theocracy; how could they\r\npossibly think of the idea of abolishing Sabbath and holidays,\r\ncircumcision and ablutions, all and everything, to be guided by the\r\nphantom of hope, love, and faith, against which James argues in his\r\nepistle with all the energy of his soul? Those inexperienced saints did\r\nnot know that the Pharisean doctors held similar theories, and that Paul\r\ncould not possibly hope to meet with any success among the Gentiles if\r\nhe had come to them with the laws of the Jews. They were Roman citizens,\r\nwho contemned the laws of the barbarians. Had Paul come with the word\r\nJudaism on his lips, he would have surely failed. Had he come to enforce\r\na foreign law, he would have been laughed at as a madman. They did not\r\nknow that Paul cared not for an hundred and one laws, as long as the\r\nessence and substance could be saved and preserved; that he held that\r\nlaws are local, the spirit is universal; that laws are limitations, the\r\nspirit is free and the property of all men of all ages and climes; that\r\nhe was determined to drop everything which could retard his progress.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, and this was the worst, they could not forgive him\r\nfor preaching the theological kingdom of heaven. A kingdom of Israel--a\r\nthrone of David, a Davidian prince, a Zion and a Jerusalem in heaven,\r\nand slavery, misery, and oppression on earth--was so new and foreign to\r\nthem, so contrary to what they had heard from their Master, that they\r\ncould not accept it. What should become of Peter's Messiah, of the hopes\r\nand promises connected with the second advent, if all at once the whole\r\nscheme is transported from earth to heaven? It was too much\r\ndisappointment, they could not endure it. Those men did not understand\r\nthat Paul had carefully to avoid every conflict with the Roman\r\nauthorities. He was too prudent to be crucified. They could not\r\ncomprehend that his great object was not to remove the evil at once; he\r\nintended to sow the seed, to bring forth the plant; to give to the\r\nheathens correct notions of God, duty, responsibility, purity, holiness,\r\nmorality, justice, humanity, and freedom, which in proper time should\r\nnecessarily break the chains, revolutionize the sentiments, and elevate\r\nthe views, hopes, aspirations, and designs of the nations.\r\n\r\nThey could not comprehend that their Messiah and kingdom of heaven,\r\ntogether with his terrible message of the end of all flesh and the last\r\njudgment day, were means, and nothing but means, to captivate and reform\r\nthe heathen. His Son of God was crucified and resurrected from the dead\r\nto forewarn all of the approaching end of all flesh; to show that in a\r\nlittle while all the dead should resurrect and the living should be\r\nchanged to spiritual beings. He had been given all power by the Almighty\r\nto conduct the catastrophe of the world, and would be present at the\r\nlast judgment day. But after all that is over, the earth and man changed\r\nto a new state of spiritual life, then the Son of God returns the\r\nkingdom to the Father, and God will be again all in all. So the Son of\r\nGod was a general superintendent, the demiurge for the time being, a\r\ndoctrine of which the apostles had no knowledge, and to which they\r\ncould not give their consent. He could not get them to understand that\r\nthese were the means for the conversion of the Gentiles, and that he had\r\nquite another gospel for the enlightened portion of the community. They\r\ncould not see that among heathens used to apotheosis, man-worship, and\r\nplastic gods, ideas, to become effective, must put on concrete and\r\ntangible bodies.\r\n\r\nThey could not imagine that the sensuality and corruption of the age\r\nrequired heroic and terror-striking means to rouse and to move the\r\nmasses; and so the dissensions and troubles between Paul and the nascent\r\nChurch increased with the success of Paul among the Gentiles. His\r\nepistles, one and all, are polemics, not against heathenism or against\r\nJudaism, but against his colleagues in Jerusalem, whom, together with\r\ntheir doctrines, he treats in a most reckless manner. They could not\r\nwrite to counterbalance Paul--in fact, there were no writers of any note\r\namong them. Therefore, only one side of the polemics, that of Paul, is\r\nfully represented in the New Testament; and the side of the Jewish\r\nChristians remained mostly matter of tradition.\r\n\r\nMessengers were sent to follow Paul to undo his gospel and preach that\r\nof the apostles; to introduce the law and circumcision among the Gentile\r\nChristians. Those messengers in many cases succeeded, notwithstanding\r\nthe thundering epistles of Paul. So his influence was weakened and his\r\nprogress retarded among the Gentiles till finally, after ten years of\r\nhard work, he concluded upon going to Jerusalem and, if possible,\r\neffecting a compromise with the apostolic congregation. It was a\r\ndangerous time for him to go to Jerusalem, for just then the fanatic\r\nhigh-priest, Ananias, had convened a court of his willing tools, tried\r\nJames, the brother of Jesus, and, finding him guilty, of what God only\r\nknows, had him and some of his associates executed--a bloody deed, which\r\ncost him his office, on account of the loud and emphatic protestations\r\nof the Jews before Agrippa II and the Roman governor. Therefore, Paul\r\nwas cautioned by prophets and friends not to go to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBut he was not the man to be frightened by dangers; he was the very type\r\nof boldness and courage. He went to Jerusalem to effect a conciliation\r\nwith the Church. A synod met in the house of James the apostle, who had\r\nsucceeded the former James as head of the Church, and Paul was told to\r\ndo that against which his conscience, his honor, his manhood must have\r\nrevolted: he was required to play the hypocrite in Jerusalem, in order\r\nto pacify the brethren who were angry at him. The thousands of Jews,\r\nthey said, who were zealous for the law, and were informed how Paul\r\ntaught the people to forsake Moses, to give up circumcision and the\r\nancient customs, hearing of his presence in Jerusalem, \"the multitude\r\nmust needs come together,\" which points to the Jewish Christians\r\nfaithful to the law. Therefore they advised him to go through the\r\nmockery of a purification at the Temple, \"to be at charges,\" as they\r\ncalled it, with some who had vowed a vow, and make the prescribed\r\nsacrifices after the purification.\r\n\r\nPoor man! After so much labor, such ardent toils, such numerous perils,\r\ndangers, anxieties, trials, reverses, and triumphs, after ten long years\r\nof such work and such dangers, he is not safe in Jerusalem among his own\r\nkinsmen and among those whose Master he glorified, whose doctrines he\r\ntaught, and whose interests he protected. How small must he have\r\nappeared to himself when walking up the Temple Mount in the company of\r\nthe four men, whose expenses he paid, to be purified with them: \"And all\r\nmay know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,\r\nare nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the\r\nlaw.\" The man who had defied a world, to submit to the humbling\r\ndictation of his colleagues, who were children in comparison with\r\nhim--this is mortifying to the utmost. This is the time of which it is\r\nsaid in the _Talmud_ that Paul or Acher narrated, that on passing behind\r\nthe _sanctum sanctorum_ he heard the _Bath-kol_ or Holy Ghost exclaim:\r\n\"Return, all ye forward children; all return, except Paul, who has known\r\nme and rebelled against me.\" Paul never forgot, never forgave, this\r\nhumiliation. It estranged his feelings altogether from his colleagues in\r\nJerusalem, and he embraced the first best opportunity to rid himself\r\nentirely of his Jewish associations.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity soon offered. While near the Temple some Jews from Asia\r\nMinor recognized him. A disturbance ensued. He was arrested and locked\r\nup in the castle by the Roman commander. Here the author of the Acts\r\nbrings in a terrible tumult--speeches, trials, a Jewish mob, with a\r\nnoble Roman stepping in in time to wind up dramatically--not one word of\r\nwhich is historical. Paul, standing accused as the ringleader of the new\r\nsect who expected the second advent of the Messiah, could only appear\r\ndangerous to the zealous and vigilant Roman authorities. Nothing else\r\nwas necessary to put his life in jeopardy. In the night he made up his\r\nmind to appeal to Cæsar, because he was a Roman citizen. Therefore he\r\nwas sent to Cæsarea, to the governor, under the protection of soldiers.\r\nNot a sound was heard in his favor among the Jewish Christians. Not an\r\nangel appeared. Not a solitary miracle was wrought; none dreamed a\r\ndream; nobody had a vision; the Holy Ghost was as silent as the grave;\r\nnone of all the Christians in Palestine showed his face, when Paul,\r\nloaded with chains, was transported from Jerusalem to Cæsarea. This\r\nsilence speaks volumes. They did not care much about the innovator.\r\nTherefore Paul's epistles from his prison in Cæsarea are thunder-bolts\r\nagainst the law, circumcision, and his colleagues in Jerusalem. It is\r\nthe offended man, the wounded lion, who retaliates in his anger.\r\n\r\nIn Cæsarea another mock trial is described by the author of the Acts.\r\nThere can be little doubt that Ananias, the Sadducean high-priest who\r\nhad slain James, thirsted also after the blood of Paul. But it is\r\ncertainly not true that Felix was governor of Judea when Ananias was\r\nhigh-priest. Felix and Festus had been removed from their offices before\r\nAnanias was made high-priest, as the authentic sources of history show.\r\nIf tried at Cæsarea at all--which is doubtful, because Paul had appealed\r\nto Cæsar--he was tried before Albinus. His speeches recorded in the Acts\r\ncontain sentences of Paul, but many more additions from the author of\r\nthe Acts.\r\n\r\nIt matters little, however, whether Paul was tried before Albinus or\r\nFelix, or whether there was a trial at all. He had appealed to Cæsar, in\r\norder to estrange himself from his colleagues in Jerusalem and to come\r\nbefore his converts as an expatriated man, although Agrippa himself had\r\nsaid, \"This man might have been set at liberty had he not appealed unto\r\nCæsar.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately he was detained in Cæsarea, when Nero in Rome put to death\r\nthe Christians in his own gardens with exquisite cruelty, and added\r\nmockery and derision to their sufferings. Had he been brought to Rome\r\n_then_, no angels could have saved his life, and no power could have\r\nprotected him for two years. He came to Rome in the year 65, when the\r\ncruelty of Nero's proceedings against the Christians filled every breast\r\nwith compassion, and humanity relented in favor of the Christians. Then\r\nit was possible for Paul to have a hearing in Rome, where he lived in a\r\nhired house for two years.\r\n\r\nNeither Paul nor Peter was ever bishop of Rome, nor was either of them\r\nbeheaded in Rome or anywhere else. All the legends and myths concerning\r\nthem are void of truth. We know that Paul, who was then about\r\nthirty-five years old, wrote from Rome epistles in defence of his gospel\r\nand against his colleagues in Jerusalem, in the same spirit as those\r\nfrom Cæsarea. We know, furthermore, that he went from Rome to Illyricum,\r\nwhere he preached his gospel. We know that he returned to Asia, and\r\nwrote the quintessence of his gospel in his epistle to the Romans. We\r\nknow that many passages in his epistles were written, after the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem, when Paul was about forty years old, and his\r\nprincipal activity commenced still later, in opposition to Rabbi Akiba\r\nand his colleagues. We know from the _Talmud_ that he married and left\r\ndaughters. We know also numerous stories of Acher or Paul and his\r\ndisciple, Rabbi Mair.\r\n\r\nLong after the death of the apostles the Christianity of Paul and the\r\nMessiahism of Peter were Platonized by the Alexandrian eclectics in a\r\nsemi-gnostic manner, which gave birth to the fourth gospel, according to\r\nJohn, and the two epistles of John the Elder, not the apostle, about\r\nA.D. 160, of which the Synoptics have no idea. They had only the\r\nChristianity of Paul and of Peter before them. An original Peter gospel,\r\nPaul's epistles, and the different traditions of the various\r\ncongregations were their sources, which they attempted to blend into one\r\nsystem. All the gospel writers lived in the second century; were not\r\nacquainted with the particulars of the story; had an imperfect knowledge\r\nof the Jews, their laws and doctrines; wrote in favor of the Romans,\r\nwhom they wished to convert, and against the Jews, whom they could not\r\nconvert.\r\n\r\nThe third century inherited four distinct systems of Christianity: that\r\nof Jesus with the pure theocracy, that of Peter with the Messiah and his\r\nsecond advent, that of Paul with the Son of God and the approaching end\r\nof all flesh, and that of John with the Logos and the self-aggrandizing\r\ndemi-god or man-god on earth. The difficulties and dissensions arising\r\nfrom the attempts at uniting all these contradictory systems in one,\r\nended with the Council of Nice, in the beginning of the fourth century,\r\nand the establishment of an orthodox creed, the excommunication of the\r\nJewish Christians, and the establishment of the Church as a state\r\ninstitution. Then the sword and the pyre established doctrines.\r\n\r\nOn comparison you will find that Jesus became the Saviour of the\r\nGentiles by the exertion of Paul; that the means which Peter and Paul\r\nadopted for momentary purposes have been turned into main dogmas; that\r\nthe religion which Jesus taught and believed is partly laid aside, and\r\nthe rest is unimportant in Christology, but he himself has been adopted\r\nin place of his religion; and that the entire New Testament has no\r\nknowledge of the Trinity and the orthodox creed. On comparison you will\r\ndiscover that, if any of our modern congregations are Christian, the\r\napostolic congregation of Jerusalem was heretic. If the pope is a\r\nChristian, Paul was not. If the orthodox creed tells what one must\r\nbelieve in order to be a Christian, then Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew. If\r\nthe religion and the theocracy which Jesus preached are to become the\r\nuniversal religion, all dogmas must fall, and God alone be all in all.\r\nMan must become his own priest, prince, and prophet. Justice must govern\r\nthe nations, love must construe the law, virtue and righteousness must\r\nlead to satisfaction and happiness, and man's consciousness of God,\r\nimmortality, morals, and moral responsibility must be his catechism, his\r\nguiding star, his protecting angel in life and death. No dogmas; truth,\r\nin the name of God!\r\n\r\nI see it, although it is not now; I behold it, although it is not nigh.\r\nA star will arise from Jacob in whose soft brilliancy will shine forth\r\nall the great and redeeming truth. Freedom and humanity, justice and\r\nlove in the name of God, are the right religion; to strive for them is\r\ndivine worship, to love them is holiness.\r\n\r\nThis was the object of Paul. The means to accomplish that object were\r\nthe necessities of the age to convert that generation. He could not\r\ndream of the idea that the means would obscure the object, that the\r\nservant would occupy the master's seat. His was a fearless, powerful,\r\nand unyielding character, terribly in earnest to break down the ancient\r\nworld and create a new one, and his success, though incomplete, was\r\nwonderful. Men like Jesus and Paul, whose great aim was to benefit and\r\nto elevate human nature, however widely we may differ from them, deserve\r\nthe student's laborious research, the philanthropist's most profound\r\nadmiration, the monuments which the human mind rears to their memory.\r\nGreat works are the testimony of their authors, and great minds are the\r\ndiadem and honor, the ornament and pride of human nature. The God Jesus\r\nand the supernatural Paul appear small in the focus of reason. The\r\npatriotic and enthusiastic Jesus and the brave, bold, wise, and mighty\r\nPaul are grand types of humanity among those hundred stars in the\r\nhorizon of history which have made the history of the human family.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HENRY NEWMAN\r\n\r\nThe _prima-facie_ view of early Christianity, in the eyes of witnesses\r\nexternal to it, is presented to us in the brief but vivid descriptions\r\ngiven by Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny, the only heathen writers who\r\ndistinctly mention it for the first hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nTacitus is led to speak of the religion, on occasion of the\r\nconflagration of Rome, which was popularly imputed to Nero. \"To put an\r\nend to the report,\" he says, \"he laid the guilt on others, and visited\r\nthem with the most exquisite punishment, those, namely, who, held in\r\nabhorrence for their crimes (_per flagitia invisos_), were popularly\r\ncalled Christians. The author of that profession (_nominis_) was Christ,\r\nwho, in the reign of Tiberius, was capitally punished by the procurator,\r\nPontius Pilate. The deadly superstition (_exitiabilis superstitio_),\r\nthough checked for a while, broke out afresh; and that, not only\r\nthroughout Judea, the original seat of the evil, but through the city\r\nalso, whither all things atrocious or shocking (_atrocia aut pudenda_)\r\nflow together from every quarter and thrive. At first, certain were\r\nseized who avowed it; then, on their report, a vast multitude were\r\nconvicted not so much of firing the city, as of hatred of mankind (_odio\r\nhumani generis_).\" After describing their tortures, he continues: \"In\r\nconsequence, though they were guilty, and deserved most signal\r\npunishment, they began to be pitied, as if destroyed not for any public\r\nobject, but from the barbarity of one man.\"\r\n\r\nSuetonius relates the same transactions thus: \"Capital punishments were\r\ninflicted on the Christians, a class of men of a new and magical\r\nsuperstition (_superstitionis novæ et maleficæ_).\" What gives additional\r\ncharacter to this statement is its context, for it occurs as one out of\r\nvarious police or sanctuary or domestic regulations, which Nero made,\r\nsuch as \"controlling private expenses, forbidding taverns to serve meat,\r\nrepressing the contests of theatrical parties, and securing the\r\nintegrity of wills.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pliny was governor of Pontus, he wrote his celebrated letter to the\r\nemperor Trajan, to ask advice how he was to deal with the Christians,\r\nwhom he found there in great numbers. One of his points of hesitation\r\nwas whether the very profession of Christianity was not by itself\r\nsufficient to justify punishment; \"whether the name itself should be\r\nvisited, though clear of flagitious acts (_flagitia_), or only when\r\nconnected with them.\" He says he had ordered for execution such as\r\npersevered in their profession after repeated warnings, \"as not\r\ndoubting, whatever it was they professed, that at any rate contumacy and\r\ninflexible obstinacy ought to be punished.\" He required them to invoke\r\nthe gods, to sacrifice wine and frankincense to the images of the\r\nEmperor, and to blaspheme Christ; \"to which,\" he adds, \"it is said no\r\nreal Christian can be compelled.\" Renegades informed him that \"the sum\r\ntotal of their offence or fault was meeting before light on an appointed\r\nday, and saying with one another a form of words (_carmen_) to Christ,\r\nas if to a god, and binding themselves by oath (not to the commission of\r\nany wickedness, but) against the commission of theft, robbery, adultery,\r\nbreach of trust, denial of deposits; that, after this they were\r\naccustomed to separate, and then to meet again for a meal, but eaten all\r\ntogether and harmless; however, that they had even left this off after\r\nhis edicts enforcing the imperial prohibition of _hetæriæ_ or\r\nassociations.\" He proceeded to put two women to the torture, but\r\n\"discovered nothing beyond a bad and excessive superstition\"\r\n(_superstitionem pravam et immodicam_), \"the contagion\" of which, he\r\ncontinues, \"had spread through villages and country, till the temples\r\nwere emptied of worshippers.\"\r\n\r\nIn these testimonies, which will form a natural and convenient text for\r\nwhat is to follow, we have various characteristics brought before us of\r\nthe religion to which they relate. It was a superstition, as all three\r\nwriters agree; a bad and excessive superstition, according to Pliny; a\r\nmagical superstition, according to Suetonius; a deadly superstition,\r\naccording to Tacitus. Next, it was embodied in a society, and, moreover,\r\na secret and unlawful society or _hetæria_; and it was a proselytizing\r\nsociety; and its very name was connected with \"flagitious,\" \"atrocious,\"\r\nand \"shocking\" acts.\r\n\r\nNow these few points, which are not all which might be set down, contain\r\nin themselves a distinct and significant description of Christianity;\r\nbut they have far greater meaning when illustrated by the history of the\r\ntimes, the testimony of later writers, and the acts of the Roman\r\ngovernment toward its professors. It is impossible to mistake the\r\njudgment passed on the religion by these three writers, and still more\r\nclearly by other writers and imperial functionaries. They evidently\r\nassociated Christianity with the oriental superstitions, whether\r\npropagated by individuals or embodied in a rite, which were in that day\r\ntraversing the empire, and which in the event acted so remarkable a part\r\nin breaking up the national forms of worship, and so in preparing the\r\nway for Christianity. This, then, is the broad view which the educated\r\nheathen took of Christianity; and, if it had been very unlike those\r\nrites and curious arts in external appearance, they would not have\r\nconfused it with them.\r\n\r\nChanges in society are by a providential appointment commonly preceded\r\nand facilitated by the setting in of a certain current in men's thoughts\r\nand feelings in that direction toward which a change is to be made.\r\nAnd, as lighter substances whirl about before the tempest and presage\r\nit, so words and deeds, ominous but not effective of the coming\r\nrevolution, are circulated beforehand through the multitude or pass\r\nacross the field of events. This was specially the case with\r\nChristianity, as became its high dignity; it came heralded and attended\r\nby a crowd of shadows, shadows of itself, impotent and monstrous as\r\nshadows are, but not at first sight distinguishable from it by common\r\nspectators. Before the mission of the apostles a movement, of which\r\nthere had been earlier parallels, had begun in Egypt, Syria, and the\r\nneighboring countries, tending to the propagation of new and peculiar\r\nforms of worship throughout the empire. Prophecies were afloat that some\r\nnew order of things was coming in from the East, which increased the\r\nexisting unsettlement of the popular mind; pretenders made attempts to\r\nsatisfy its wants, and old traditions of the truth, embodied for ages in\r\nlocal or in national religions, gave to these attempts a doctrinal and\r\nritual shape, which became an additional point of resemblance to that\r\ntruth which was soon visibly to appear.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character of the rites in question lay in their\r\nappealing to the gloomy rather than to the cheerful and hopeful\r\nfeelings, and in their influencing the mind through fear. The notions of\r\nguilt and expiation, of evil and good to come, and of dealings with the\r\ninvisible world, were in some shape or other preëminent in them, and\r\nformed a striking contrast to the classical polytheism, which was gay\r\nand graceful, as was natural in a civilized age. The new rites, on the\r\nother hand, were secret; their doctrine was mysterious; their profession\r\nwas a discipline, beginning in a formal initiation, manifested in an\r\nassociation, and exercised in privation and pain. They were from the\r\nnature of the case proselytizing societies, for they were rising into\r\npower; nor were they local, but vagrant, restless, intrusive, and\r\nencroaching. Their pretensions to supernatural knowledge brought them\r\ninto easy connection with magic and astrology, which are as attractive\r\nto the wealthy and luxurious as the more vulgar superstitions to the\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nThe Christian, being at first accounted a kind of Jew, was even on that\r\nscore included in whatever odium, and whatever bad associations,\r\nattended on the Jewish name. But in a little time his independence of\r\nthe rejected people was clearly understood, as even the persecutions\r\nshow; and he stood upon his own ground. Still his character did not\r\nchange in the eyes of the world; for favor or for reproach, he was still\r\nassociated with the votaries of secret and magical rites. The emperor\r\nHadrian, noted as he is for his inquisitive temper, and a partaker in so\r\nmany mysteries, still believed that the Christians of Egypt allowed\r\nthemselves in the worship of Serapis. They are brought into connection\r\nwith the magic of Egypt in the history of what is commonly called the\r\nThundering legion, so far as this, that the rain which relieved the\r\nEmperor's army in the field, and which the Church ascribed to the\r\nprayers of the Christian soldiers, is by Dio Cassius attributed to an\r\nEgyptian magician, who obtained it by invoking Mercury and other\r\nspirits. This war had been the occasion of one of the first recognitions\r\nwhich the State had conceded to the oriental rites, though statesmen and\r\nemperors, as private men, had long taken part in them. The emperor\r\nMarcus had been urged by his fears of the Marcomanni to resort to these\r\nforeign introductions, and is said to have employed Magi and Chaldæans\r\nin averting an unsuccessful issue of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that, in the growing countenance which was extended to\r\nthese rites in the third century, Christianity came in for a share. The\r\nchapel of Alexander Severus contained statues of Abraham, Orpheus,\r\nApollonius, Pythagoras, and our Lord. Here indeed, as in the case of\r\nZenobia's Judaism, an eclectic philosophy aided the comprehension of\r\nreligions. But, immediately before Alexander, Heliogabalus, who was no\r\nphilosopher, while he formally seated his Syrian idol in the Palatine,\r\nwhile he observed the mysteries of Cybele and Adonis, and celebrated his\r\nmagic rites with human victims, intended also, according to Lampridius,\r\nto unite with his horrible superstition \"the Jewish and Samaritan\r\nreligions and the Christian rite, that so the priesthood of Heliogabalus\r\nmight comprise the mystery of every worship.\" Hence, more or less, the\r\nstories which occur in ecclesiastical history of the conversion or\r\ngood-will of the emperors to the Christian faith, of Hadrian, Mammæa,\r\nand others, besides Heliogabalus and Alexander. Such stories might often\r\nmean little more than that they favored it among other forms of oriental\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said is sufficient to bring before the mind an historical\r\nfact, which indeed does not need evidence. Upon the established\r\nreligions of Europe the East had renewed her encroachments, and was\r\npouring forth a family of rites which in various ways attracted the\r\nattention of the luxurious, the political, the ignorant, the restless,\r\nand the remorseful. Armenian, Chaldee, Egyptian, Jew, Syrian, Phrygian,\r\nas the case might be, was the designation of the new hierophant; and\r\nmagic, superstition, barbarism, jugglery, were the names given to his\r\nrite by the world. In this company appeared Christianity. When then\r\nthree well-informed writers call Christianity a superstition and a\r\nmagical superstition, they were not using words at random, or the\r\nlanguage of abuse, but they were describing it in distinct and\r\nrecognized terms as cognate to those gloomy, secret, odious,\r\ndisreputable religions which were making so much disturbance up and down\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nThe Gnostic family suitably traces its origin to a mixed race, which had\r\ncommenced its national history by associating orientalism with\r\nrevelation. After the captivity of the ten tribes Samaria was colonized\r\nby \"men from Babylon and Cushan, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from\r\nSepharvaim,\" who were instructed at their own instance in \"the manner of\r\nthe God of the land,\" by one of the priests of the Church of Jeroboam.\r\nThe consequence was that \"they feared the Lord and served their own\r\ngods.\" Of this country was Simon, the reputed patriarch of the Gnostics;\r\nand he is introduced in the Acts of the Apostles as professing those\r\nmagical powers which were so principal a characteristic of the oriental\r\nmysteries. His heresy, though broken into a multitude of sects, was\r\npoured over the world with a catholicity not inferior in its day to that\r\nof Christianity. St. Peter, who fell in with him originally in Samaria,\r\nseems to have encountered him again at Rome. At Rome St. Polycarp met\r\nMarcion of Pontus, whose followers spread through Italy, Egypt, Syria,\r\nArabia, and Persia.\r\n\r\n\"When [the reader of Christian history] comes to the second century,\"\r\nsays Dr. Burton, \"he finds that Gnosticism, under some form or other,\r\nwas professed in every part of the then civilized world. He finds it\r\ndivided into schools, as numerously and as zealously attended as any\r\nwhich Greece or Asia could boast in their happiest days. He meets with\r\nnames totally unknown to him before, which excited as much sensation as\r\nthose of Aristotle or Plato. He hears of volumes having been written in\r\nsupport of this new philosophy, not one of which has survived to our own\r\nday.\" Many of the founders of these sects had been Christians. Others\r\nwere of Jewish parentage; others were more or less connected in fact\r\nwith the pagan rites to which their own bore so great a resemblance.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the history of these sects, and though it may be a\r\nquestion whether they can be properly called \"superstitions,\" and though\r\nmany of them numbered educated men among their teachers and followers,\r\nthey closely resembled--at least in ritual and profession--the vagrant\r\npagan mysteries which have been above described. Their very name of\r\n\"Gnostic\" implied the possession of a secret, which was to be\r\ncommunicated to their disciples. Ceremonial observances were the\r\npreparation, and symbolical rites the instrument, of initiation. Tatian\r\nand Montanus, the representatives of very distinct schools, agreed in\r\nmaking asceticism a rule of life.\r\n\r\nSuch were the Gnostics; and to external and prejudiced spectators,\r\nwhether philosophers, as Celsus and Porphyry, or the multitude, they\r\nwore an appearance sufficiently like the Church to be mistaken for her\r\nin the latter part of the ante-Nicene period, as she was confused with\r\nthe pagan mysteries in the earlier.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed in our contemplation of this reflection, as it may be\r\ncalled, of primitive Christianity in the mirror of the world. All three\r\nwriters, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny, call it a \"superstition\"; this\r\nis no accidental imputation, but is repeated by a variety of subsequent\r\nwriters and speakers. The charge of Thyestean banquets scarcely lasts a\r\nhundred years; but, while pagan witnesses are to be found, the Church is\r\naccused of superstition. Now what is meant by the word thus attached by\r\na _consensus_ of heathen authorities to Christianity? At least it cannot\r\nmean a religion in which a man might think what he pleased, and was set\r\nfree from all yokes, whether of ignorance, fear, authority, or\r\npriestcraft. When heathen writers call the oriental rites superstitions,\r\nthey evidently use the word in its modern sense. It cannot surely be\r\ndoubted that they apply it in the same sense to Christianity. But\r\nPlutarch explains for us the word at length in his treatise which bears\r\nthe name: \"Of all kinds of fear,\" he says, \"superstition is the most\r\nfatal to action and resource. He does not fear the sea who does not\r\nsail, nor war who does not serve, nor robbers who keeps at home, nor the\r\nsycophant who is poor, nor the envious if he is a private man, nor an\r\nearthquake if he lives in Gaul, nor thunder if he lives in Æthiopia; but\r\nhe who fears the gods fears everything--earth, seas, air, sky, darkness,\r\nlight, noises, silence, sleep. Slaves sleep and forget their masters; of\r\nthe fettered doth sleep lighten the chain; inflamed wounds, ulcers cruel\r\nand agonizing, are not felt by the sleeping. Superstition alone has come\r\nto no terms with sleep; but in the very sleep of her victims, as though\r\nthey were in the realms of the impious, she raises horrible spectres and\r\nmonstrous phantoms and various pains, and whirls the miserable soul\r\nabout and persecutes it. They rise, and, instead of making light of what\r\nis unreal, they fall into the hands of quacks and conjurers, who say,\r\n'Call the crone to expiate, bathe in the sea, and sit all day on the\r\nground.'\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a vivid picture of Plutarch's idea of the essence of\r\nsuperstition; it was the imagination of the existence of an unseen\r\never-present Master; the bondage of a rule of life, of a continual\r\nresponsibility; obligation to attend to little things, the impossibility\r\nof escaping from duty, the inability to choose or change one's religion,\r\nan interference with the enjoyment of life, a melancholy view of the\r\nworld, sense of sin, horror at guilt, apprehension of punishment, dread,\r\nself-abasement, depression, anxiety, and endeavor to be at peace with\r\nheaven, and error and absurdity in the methods chosen for the purpose.\r\nSuch, too, had been the idea of the Epicurean Velleius, when he shrunk\r\nwith horror from the \"_sempiternus dominus_\" and \"_curiosus Deus_\" of\r\nthe Stoics. Such, surely, was the meaning of Tacitus, Suetonius, and\r\nPliny. And hence, of course, the frequent reproach cast on Christians as\r\ncredulous, weak-minded, and poor-spirited. The heathen objectors in\r\nMinucius and Lactantius speak of their \"old-woman's tales.\" Celsus\r\naccuses them of \"assenting at random and without reason,\" saying, \"Do\r\nnot inquire, but believe.\" \"They lay it down,\" he says elsewhere: \"Let\r\nno educated man approach, no man of wisdom, no man of sense; but if a\r\nman be unlearned, weak in intellect, an infant, let him come with\r\nconfidence. Confessing that these are worthy of their God, they\r\nevidently desire, as they are able, to convert none but fools, and\r\nvulgar, and stupid, and slavish, women and boys.\" They \"take in the\r\nsimple and lead him where they will.\" They address themselves to\r\n\"youths, house-servants, and the weak in intellect.\" They \"hurry away\r\nfrom the educated, as not fit subjects of their imposition, and inveigle\r\nthe rustic.\" \"Thou,\" says the heathen magistrate to the martyr\r\nFructuosus, \"who as a teacher dost disseminate a new fable, that fickle\r\ngirls may desert the groves and abandon Jupiter, condemn, if thou art\r\nwise, the anile creed.\"\r\n\r\nHence the epithets of itinerant, mountebank, conjurer, cheat, sophist,\r\nand sorcerer, heaped upon the teachers of Christianity; sometimes to\r\naccount for the report or apparent truth of their miracles, sometimes to\r\nexplain their success. Our Lord was said to have learned his miraculous\r\npower in Egypt; \"wizard, mediciner, cheat, rogue, conjurer,\" were the\r\nepithets applied to him by the opponents of Eusebius; they \"worship that\r\ncrucified sophist,\" says Lucian; \"Paul, who surpasses all the conjurers\r\nand impostors who ever lived,\" is Julian's account of the apostle. \"You\r\nhave sent through the whole world,\" says St. Justin to Trypho, \"to\r\npreach that a certain atheistic and lawless sect has sprung from one\r\nJesus, a Galilean cheat.\" \"We know,\" says Lucian, speaking of Chaldæans\r\nand magicians, \"the Syrian from Palestine, who is the sophist in these\r\nmatters, how many lunatics, with eyes distorted and mouth in foam, he\r\nraises and sends away restored, ridding them from the evil at a great\r\nprice.\" \"If any conjurer came to them, a man of skill and knowing how to\r\nmanage matters,\" says the same writer, \"he made money in no time, with a\r\nbroad grin at the simple fellows.\" The officer who had custody of St.\r\nPerpetua feared her escape from prison \"by magical incantations.\" When\r\nSt. Tiburtius had walked barefoot on hot coals, his judge cried out\r\nthat Christ had taught him magic. St. Anastasia was thrown into prison\r\nas a mediciner; the populace called out against St. Agnes, \"Away with\r\nthe witch,\" _Tolle magam, tolle maleficam_. When St. Bonosus and St.\r\nMaximilian bore the burning pitch without shrinking, Jews and Gentiles\r\ncried out, \"_Isti magi et malefici_.\" \"What new delusion,\" says the\r\nheathen magistrate concerning St. Romanus, \"has brought in these\r\nsophists to deny the worship of the gods? How doth this chief sorcerer\r\nmock us, skilled by his Thessalian charm (_carmine_) to laugh at\r\npunishment!\"\r\n\r\nIt explains the phenomenon, which has created so much surprise to\r\ncertain moderns--that a grave, well-informed historian like Tacitus\r\nshould apply to Christians what sounds like abuse. Yet what is the\r\ndifficulty, supposing that Christians were considered _mathematici_ and\r\n_magi_, and these were the secret intriguers against established\r\ngovernment, the allies of desperate politicians, the enemies of the\r\nestablished religion, the disseminators of lying rumors, the\r\nperpetrators of poisonings and other crimes? \"Read this,\" says Paley,\r\nafter quoting some of the most beautiful and subduing passages of St.\r\nPaul, \"read this, and then think of _exitiabilis superstitio_\"; and he\r\ngoes on to express a wish \"in contending with heathen authorities, to\r\nproduce our books against theirs,\" as if it were a matter of books.\r\n\r\nPublic men care very little for books; the finest sentiments, the most\r\nluminous philosophy, the deepest theology, inspiration itself, moves\r\nthem but little; they look at facts, and care only for facts. The\r\nquestion was, What was the worth, what the tendency of the Christian\r\nbody in the State? What Christians said, what they thought, was little\r\nto the purpose. They might exhort to peaceableness and passive obedience\r\nas strongly as words could speak; but what did they _do_, what was their\r\npolitical position? This is what statesmen thought of then, as they do\r\nnow. What had men of the world to do with abstract proofs or first\r\nprinciples? A statesman measures parties and sects and writers by their\r\nbearing upon _him_; and he has a practised eye in this sort of judgment,\r\nand is not likely to be mistaken. \"'What is Truth?' said jesting\r\nPilate.\" Apologies, however eloquent or true, availed nothing with the\r\nRoman magistrate against the sure instinct which taught him to dread\r\nChristianity. It was a dangerous enemy to any power not built upon\r\nitself; he felt it, and the event justified his apprehension.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the well-known character of the Roman State in its\r\ndealings with its subjects. It had had from the first an extreme\r\njealousy of secret societies; it was prepared to grant a large\r\ntoleration and a broad comprehension, but, as is the case with modern\r\ngovernments, it wished to have jurisdiction and the ultimate authority\r\nin every movement of the body politic and social, and its civil\r\ninstitutions were based, or essentially depended, on its religion.\r\nAccordingly, every innovation upon the established paganism, except it\r\nwas allowed by the law, was rigidly repressed. Hence the professors of\r\nlow superstitions, of mysteries, of magic, of astrology, were the\r\noutlaws of society, and were in a condition analogous, if the comparison\r\nmay be allowed, to smugglers or poachers among ourselves, or perhaps to\r\nburglars and highwaymen; for the Romans had ever burnt the sorcerer and\r\nbanished his consulters for life. It was an ancient custom. And at\r\nmysteries they looked with especial suspicion, because, since the\r\nestablished religion did not include them in its provisions, they really\r\ndid supply what may be called a demand of the age.\r\n\r\nWe know what opposition had been made in Rome even to the philosophy of\r\nGreece; much greater would be the aversion of constitutional statesmen\r\nand lawyers to the ritual of barbarians. Religion was the Roman point of\r\nhonor. \"Spaniards might rival them in numbers,\" says Cicero, \"Gauls in\r\nbodily strength, Carthaginians in address, Greeks in the arts, Italians\r\nand Latins in native talent, but the Romans surpassed all nations in\r\npiety and devotion.\" It was one of their laws, \"Let no one have gods by\r\nhimself, nor worship in private new gods nor adventitious, unless added\r\non public authority.\" Mæcenas in _Dio_ advises Augustus to honor the\r\ngods according to the national custom, because the contempt of the\r\ncountry's deities leads to civil insubordination, reception of foreign\r\nlaws, conspiracies, and secret meetings. \"Suffer no one,\" he adds, \"to\r\ndeny the gods or to practise sorcery.\" The civilian Julius Paulus lays\r\nit down as one of the leading principles of Roman law, that those who\r\nintroduce new or untried religions should be degraded, and if in the\r\nlower orders put to death. In like manner, it is enacted in one of\r\nConstantine's laws that the haruspices should not exercise their art in\r\nprivate; and there is a law of Valentinian's against nocturnal\r\nsacrifices or magic. It is more immediately to our purpose that Trajan\r\nhad been so earnest in his resistance to _hetæriæ_ or secret societies,\r\nthat, when a fire had laid waste Nicomedia, and Pliny proposed to him to\r\nincorporate a body of a hundred and fifty firemen in consequence, he was\r\nafraid of the precedent and forbade it.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said will suggest another point of view in which the\r\noriental rites were obnoxious to the government--namely, as being\r\nvagrant and proselytizing religions. If it tolerated foreign\r\nsuperstitions, this would be on the ground that districts or countries\r\nwithin its jurisdiction held them; to proselytize to a rite hitherto\r\nunknown, to form a new party, and to propagate it through the empire--a\r\nreligion not local, but catholic--was an offence against both order and\r\nreason. The State desired peace everywhere, and no change;\r\n\"considering,\" according to Lactantius, \"that they were rightly and\r\ndeservedly punished who execrated the public religion handed down to\r\nthem by their ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, surely, to deny that, in assembling for religious\r\npurposes, the Christians were breaking a solemn law, a vital principle\r\nof the Roman constitution; and this is the light in which their conduct\r\nwas regarded by the historians and philosophers of the empire. This was\r\na very strong act on the part of the disciples of the great apostle, who\r\nhad enjoined obedience to the powers that be. Time after time they\r\nresisted the authority of the magistrate; and this is a phenomenon\r\ninexplicable on the theory of private judgment or of the voluntary\r\nprinciple. The justification of such disobedience lies simply in the\r\nnecessity of obeying the higher authority of some divine law; but if\r\nChristianity were in its essence only private and personal, as so many\r\nnow think, there was no necessity of their meeting together at all. If,\r\non the other hand, in assembling for worship and holy communion, they\r\nwere fulfilling an indispensable observance, Christianity has imposed a\r\nsocial law on the world, and formally enters the field of politics.\r\nGibbon says that, in consequence of Pliny's edict, \"the prudence of the\r\nChristians suspended their _agapæ_; but it was _impossible_ for them to\r\nomit the exercise of public worship.\" We can draw no other conclusion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three hundred years a more remarkable violation of law\r\nseems to have been admitted by the Christian body. It shall be given in\r\nthe words of Dr. Burton; he has been speaking of Maximin's edict, which\r\nprovided for the restitution of any of their lands or buildings which\r\nhad been alienated from them. \"It is plain,\" he says, \"from the terms of\r\nthis edict, that the Christians had for some time been in possession of\r\nproperty. It speaks of houses and lands which did not belong to\r\nindividuals, but to the whole body. Their possession of such property\r\ncould hardly have escaped the notice of the government; but it seems to\r\nhave been held in direct violation of a law of Diocletian, which\r\nprohibited corporate bodies or associations which were not legally\r\nrecognized, from acquiring property. The Christians were certainly not a\r\nbody recognized by law at the beginning of the reign of Diocletian, and\r\nit might almost be thought that this enactment was specially directed\r\nagainst them. But, like other laws which are founded upon tyranny, and\r\nare at variance with the first principles of justice, it is probable\r\nthat this law about corporate property was evaded. We must suppose that\r\nthe Christians had purchased lands and houses before the law was passed;\r\nand their disregard of the prohibition may be taken as another proof\r\nthat their religion had now taken so firm a footing that the executors\r\nof the laws were obliged to connive at their being broken by so numerous\r\na body.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the magistrate who presided at the martyrdom of St.\r\nRomanus calls them in Prudentius \"a rebel people\"; that Galerius speaks\r\nof them as \"a nefarious conspiracy\"; the heathen in Minucius, as \"men of\r\na desperate faction\"; that others make them guilty of sacrilege and\r\ntreason, and call them by those other titles which, more closely\r\nresembling the language of Tacitus, have been noticed above. Hence the\r\nviolent accusations against them as the destructors of the empire, the\r\nauthors of physical evils, and the cause of the anger of the gods.\r\n\r\n\"Men cry out,\" says Tertullian, \"that the State is beset, that the\r\nChristians are in their fields, in their forts, in their islands. They\r\nmourn as for a loss that every sex, condition, and now even rank is\r\ngoing over to this sect. And yet they do not by this very means advance\r\ntheir minds to the idea of some good therein hidden; they allow not\r\nthemselves to conjecture more rightly, they choose not to examine more\r\nclosely. The generality run upon a hatred of this name, with eyes so\r\nclosed that in bearing favorable testimony to anyone they mingle with it\r\nthe reproach of the name. 'A good man Caius Seius, only he is a\r\nChristian.' So another, 'I marvel that that wise man Lucius Titius hath\r\nsuddenly become a Christian.' No one reflecteth whether Caius be not\r\ntherefore good and Lucius wise because a Christian, or therefore a\r\nChristian because wise and good. They praise that which they know, they\r\nrevile that which they know not. Virtue is not in such account as hatred\r\nof the Christians. Now, then, if the hatred be of the name, what guilt\r\nis there in names? What charge against words? Unless it be that any word\r\nwhich is a name have either a barbarous or ill-omened, or a scurrilous\r\nor an immodest sound. If the Tiber cometh up to the walls, if the Nile\r\ncometh not up to the fields, if the heaven hath stood still, if the\r\nearth hath been moved, if there be any famine, if any pestilence, 'The\r\nChristians to the lions' is forthwith the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men of a desperate, lawless, reckless faction,\" says the heathen\r\nCæcilius, in the passage above referred to, \"who collect together out of\r\nthe lowest rabble the thoughtless portion, and credulous women seduced\r\nby the weakness of their sex, and form a mob of impure conspirators, of\r\nwhom nocturnal assemblies and solemn fastings and unnatural food, no\r\nsacred rite but pollution, is the bond. A tribe lurking and\r\nlight-hating, dumb for the public, talkative in corners, they despise\r\nour temples as if graves, spit at our gods, deride our religious forms;\r\npitiable themselves, they pity, forsooth, our priests; half-naked\r\nthemselves, they despise our honors and purple; monstrous folly and\r\nincredible impudence!... Day after day their abandoned morals wind their\r\nserpentine course; over the whole world are those most hideous rites of\r\nan impious association growing into shape;... they recognize each other\r\nby marks and signs, and love each other almost before they recognize;\r\npromiscuous lust is their religion. Thus does their vain and mad\r\nsuperstition glory in crimes.... The writer who tells the story of a\r\ncriminal capitally punished, and of the gibbet (_ligna feralia_) of the\r\ncross being their observance (_ceremonias_), assigns to them thereby an\r\naltar in keeping with the abandoned and wicked, that they may worship\r\n(_colant_) what they merit.... Why their mighty effort to hide and\r\nshroud whatever it is they worship (_colunt_), since things honest ever\r\nlike the open day, and crimes are secret? Why have they no altars, no\r\ntemples, no images known to us, never speak abroad, never assemble\r\nfreely, were it not that what they worship and suppress is subject\r\neither of punishment or of shame?\r\n\r\n\"What monstrous, what portentous notions do they fabricate! that that\r\nGod of theirs, whom they can neither show nor see, should be inquiring\r\ndiligently into the characters, the acts--nay, the words and secret\r\nthoughts of all men; running to and fro, forsooth, and present\r\neverywhere, troublesome, restless--nay, impudently curious they would\r\nhave him; that is, if he is close at every deed, interferes in all\r\nplaces, while he can neither attend to each as being distracted through\r\nthe whole, nor suffice for the whole as being engaged about each. Think,\r\ntoo, of their threatening fire, meditating destruction to the whole\r\nearth--nay, the world itself with its stars!... Nor content with this\r\nmad opinion, they add and append their old wives' tales about a new\r\nbirth after death, ashes and cinders, and by some strange confidence\r\nbelieve each other's lies.\r\n\r\n\"Poor creatures! consider what hangs over you after death, while you are\r\nstill alive. Lo, the greater part of you, the better, as you say, are in\r\nwant, cold, toil, hunger, and your God suffers it; but I omit common\r\ntrials. Lo, threats are offered to you, punishments, torments; crosses\r\nto be undergone now, not worshipped (_adorandæ_); fires, too, which ye\r\npredict and fear; where is that God who can recover, but cannot preserve\r\nyour life? The answer of Socrates, when he was asked about heavenly\r\nmatters, is well known: 'What is above us does not concern us.' My\r\nopinion also is, that points which are doubtful, as are the points in\r\nquestion, must be left; nor, when so many and such great men are in\r\ncontroversy on the subject, must judgment be rashly and audaciously\r\ngiven on either side, lest the consequence be either anile superstition\r\nor the overthrow of all religion.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Christianity in the eyes of those who witnessed its rise and\r\npropagation--one of a number of wild and barbarous rites which were\r\npouring in upon the empire from the ancient realms of superstition, and\r\nthe mother of a progeny of sects which were faithful to the original\r\nthey had derived from Egypt or Syria; a religion unworthy of an educated\r\nperson, as appealing, not to the intellect, but to the fears and\r\nweaknesses of human nature, and consisting, not in the rational and\r\ncheerful enjoyment, but in a morose rejection of the gifts of\r\nProvidence; a horrible religion, as inflicting or enjoining cruel\r\nsufferings, and monstrous and loathsome in its very indulgence of the\r\npassions; a religion leading by reaction to infidelity; a religion of\r\nmagic, and of the vulgar arts, real and pretended, with which magic was\r\naccompanied; a secret religion which dared not face the day; an\r\nitinerant, busy, proselytizing religion, forming an extended confederacy\r\nagainst the State, resisting its authority and breaking its laws. There\r\nmay be some exceptions to this general impression, such as Pliny's\r\ndiscovery of the innocent and virtuous rule of life adopted by the\r\nChristians of Pontus; but this only proves that Christianity was not in\r\nfact the infamous religion which the heathen thought it; it did not\r\nreverse their general belief to that effect.\r\n\r\nNow it must be granted that, in some respects, this view of Christianity\r\ndepended on the times, and would alter with their alteration. When there\r\nwas no persecution, martyrs could not be obstinate; and when the Church\r\nwas raised aloft in high places, it was no longer in caves. Still, I\r\nbelieve, it continued substantially the same in the judgment of the\r\nworld external to it while there was an external world to judge of it.\r\n\"They thought it enough,\" says Julian in the fourth century, of our Lord\r\nand his apostles, \"to deceive women, servants, and slaves, and by their\r\nmeans wives and husbands.\" \"A human fabrication,\" says he elsewhere,\r\n\"put together by wickedness, having nothing divine in it, but making a\r\nperverted use of the fable-loving, childish, irrational part of the\r\nsoul, and offering a set of wonders to create belief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miserable men,\" he says elsewhere, \"you refuse to worship the ancile,\r\nyet you worship the wood of the cross, and sign it on your foreheads,\r\nand fix it on your doors. Shall one for this hate the intelligent among\r\nyou, or pity the less understanding, who in following you have gone to\r\nsuch an excess of perdition as to leave the everlasting gods and go over\r\nto a dead Jew?\" He speaks of their adding other dead men to him who died\r\nso long ago. \"You have filled all places with sepulchres and monuments,\r\nthough it is nowhere told you in your religion to haunt the tombs and to\r\nattend upon them.\" Elsewhere he speaks of their \"leaving the gods for\r\ncorpses and relics.\" On the other hand, he attributes the growth of\r\nChristianity to its humanity toward strangers, care in burying the dead,\r\nand pretended religiousness of life. In another place he speaks of their\r\ncare of the poor.\r\n\r\nLibanius, Julian's preceptor in rhetoric, delivers the same testimony,\r\nas far as it goes. He addressed his _Oration for the Temples_ to a\r\nChristian emperor, and would in consequence be guarded in his language;\r\nhowever it runs in one direction. He speaks of \"those black-habited\r\nmen,\" meaning the monks, \"who eat more than elephants, and by the number\r\nof their potations trouble those who send them drink in their chantings,\r\nand conceal this by paleness artificially acquired.\" They \"are in good\r\ncondition out of the misfortunes of others, while they pretend to serve\r\nGod by hunger.\" Those whom they attack \"are like bees, they like\r\ndrones.\" I do not quote this passage to prove that there were monks in\r\nLibanius' days, which no one doubts, but to show his impression of\r\nChristianity, as far as his works betray it.\r\n\r\nNumantian in the same century describes in verse his voyage from Rome to\r\nGaul: one book of the poem is extant; he falls in with Christianity on\r\ntwo of the islands which lie in his course. He thus describes them as\r\nfound on one of these: \"The island is in a squalid state, being full of\r\nlight-haters. They call themselves monks, because they wish to live\r\nalone without witness. They dread the gifts, from fearing the reverses,\r\nof fortune.\" He meets on the other island a Christian, whom he had\r\nknown, of good family and fortune, and happy in his marriage, who\r\n\"impelled by the Furies had left men and gods, and, credulous exile,\r\nwas living in base concealment. Is not this herd,\" he continues, \"worse\r\nthan Circean poison? then bodies were changed, now minds.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Philopatris_, which is the work of an author of the fourth\r\ncentury, Critias is introduced pale and wild. His friend asks him if he\r\nhas seen Cerberus or Hecate; and he answers that he has heard a\r\nrigmarole from certain \"thrice-cursed sophists\"; which he thinks would\r\ndrive him mad if he heard it again, and was nearly sending him headlong\r\nover some cliff as it was. He retires for relief with his inquirer to a\r\npleasant place, shadowed by planes, where swallows and nightingales are\r\nsinging, and a quiet brook is purling. Triephon, his friend, expresses a\r\nfear lest he has heard some incantation, and is led by the course of the\r\ndialogue, before his friend tells his tale, to give some account of\r\nChristianity, being himself a Christian. After speaking of the creation,\r\nas described by Moses, he falls at once upon that doctrine of a\r\nparticular providence which is so distasteful to Plutarch, Velleius in\r\nCicero, and Cæcilius, and generally to unbelievers. \"He is in heaven,\"\r\nhe says, \"looking at just and unjust, and causing actions to be entered\r\nin books; and he will recompense all on a day which he has appointed.\"\r\nCritias objects that he cannot make this consistent with the received\r\ndoctrine about the Fates, \"even though he has perhaps been carried aloft\r\nwith his master, and initiated in unspeakable mysteries.\" He also asks\r\nif the deeds of the Scythians are written in heaven for if so there must\r\nbe many scribes there.\r\n\r\nSuch was the language of paganism after Christianity had for fifty years\r\nbeen exposed to the public gaze; after it had been before the world for\r\nfifty more, St. Augustine had still to defend it against the charge of\r\nbeing the cause of the calamities of the empire. And for the charge of\r\nmagic, when the Arian bishops were in formal disputations with the\r\nCatholic, before Gungebald, Burgundian king of France, at the end of the\r\nfifth century, we find still that they charged the Catholics with being\r\n\"_præstigiatores_,\" and worshipping a number of gods; and when the\r\nCatholics proposed that the King should repair to the shrine of St.\r\nJustus, where both parties might ask him concerning their respective\r\nfaiths, the Arians cried out that \"they would not seek enchantments\r\nlike Saul, for Scripture was enough for them, which was more powerful\r\nthan all bewitchments.\" This was said, not against strangers of whom\r\nthey knew nothing, as Ethelbert might be suspicious of St. Augustine and\r\nhis brother missionaries, but against a body of men who lived among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI do not think it can be doubted then that, had Tacitus, Suetonius, and\r\nPliny, Celsus, Porphyry, and the other opponents of Christianity lived\r\nin the fourth century, their evidence concerning Christianity would be\r\nvery much the same as it has come down to us from the centuries before\r\nit. In either case, a man of the world and a philosopher would have been\r\ndisgusted at the gloom and sadness of its profession, its\r\nmysteriousness, its claim of miracles, the want of good sense imputable\r\nto its rule of life, and the unsettlement and discord it was introducing\r\ninto the social and political world.\r\n\r\nOn the whole then I conclude as follows: If there is a form of\r\nChristianity now in the world which is accused of gross superstition, of\r\nborrowing its rites and customs from the heathen, and of ascribing to\r\nforms and ceremonies an occult virtue; a religion which is considered to\r\nburden and enslave the mind by its requisitions, to address itself to\r\nthe weak-minded and ignorant, to be supported by sophistry and\r\nimposture, and to contradict reason and exalt mere irrational faith; a\r\nreligion which impresses on the serious mind very distressing views of\r\nthe guilt and consequences of sin, sets upon the minute acts of the day,\r\none by one, their definite value for praise or blame, and thus casts a\r\ngrave shadow over the future; a religion which holds up to admiration\r\nthe surrender of wealth, and disables serious persons from enjoying it\r\nif they would; a religion, the doctrines of which, be they good or bad,\r\nare to the generality of men unknown; which is considered to bear on its\r\nvery surface signs of folly and falsehood so distinct that a glance\r\nsuffices to judge of it, and that careful examination is preposterous;\r\nwhich is felt to be so simply bad that it may be calumniated at hazard\r\nand at pleasure, it being nothing but absurdity to stand upon the\r\naccurate distribution of its guilt among its particular acts, or\r\npainfully to determine how far this or that story concerning it is\r\nliterally true, or what has to be allowed in candor, or what is\r\nimprobable, or what cuts two ways, or what is not proved, or what may be\r\nplausibly defended; a religion such that men look at a convert to it\r\nwith a feeling which no other denomination raises except Judaism,\r\nsocialism, or Mormonism--namely, with curiosity, suspicion, fear,\r\ndisgust, as the case may be, as if something strange had befallen him,\r\nas if he had had an initiation into a mystery, and had come into\r\ncommunion with dreadful influences, as if he were now one of a\r\nconfederacy which claimed him, absorbed him, stripped him of his\r\npersonality, reduced him to a mere organ or instrument of a whole; a\r\nreligion which men hate as proselytizing, anti-social, revolutionary, as\r\ndividing families, separating chief friends, corrupting the maxims of\r\ngovernment, making a mock at law, dissolving the empire, the enemy of\r\nhuman nature, and a \"conspirator against its rights and privileges\"; a\r\nreligion which they consider the champion and instrument of darkness,\r\nand a pollution calling down upon the land the anger of heaven; a\r\nreligion which they associate with intrigue and conspiracy, which they\r\nspeak about in whispers, which they detect by anticipation in whatever\r\ngoes wrong, and to which they impute whatever is unaccountable; a\r\nreligion, the very name of which they cast out as evil, and use simply\r\nas a bad epithet, and which from the impulse of self-preservation they\r\nwould persecute if they could--if there be such a religion now in the\r\nworld, it is not unlike Christianity as that same world viewed it when\r\nfirst it came forth from its divine Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNING OF ROME UNDER NERO\r\n\r\nA.D. 64\r\n\r\nSIENKIEWICZ          TACITUS\r\n\r\n     Nero when a youth was placed under charge of the philosopher\r\n     Seneca, who carefully attended to his education. During Nero's\r\n     nonage he was persevering in his studies and made great progress in\r\n     Greek. By a subterfuge of his mother's he was proclaimed emperor in\r\n     the place of Britannicus, the real heir to the throne. In the early\r\n     part of his reign public affairs were wisely conducted, but the\r\n     private life of Nero was given up to vice and profligacy. His love\r\n     for Poppæa led him into the crime of matricide, for she, wishing to\r\n     share the imperial throne, and knowing it was impossible while his\r\n     mother, Agrippina, lived, induced him to authorize her\r\n     assassination. Strange that Seneca and Burrhus should have approved\r\n     of this, yet Tacitus admits that such was the case. In the eighth\r\n     year of his reign Nero divorced his wife, Octavia, and married\r\n     Poppæa.\r\n\r\n     Nero was an accomplished musician and sang verses composed by\r\n     himself. He eagerly sought the plaudits of the multitude by\r\n     reciting his compositions in public. Historians are divided in\r\n     opinion as to whether Nero was the cause of the burning of Rome.\r\n     During the conflagration, to court popularity he ordered temporary\r\n     shelters to be provided for the houseless; yet the people did not\r\n     acclaim this deed, as it was reported that Nero, at \"the very time\r\n     Rome was in flames,\" sang the destruction of Troy in his private\r\n     theatre, likening the present disaster to that ancient catastrophe.\r\n     In order to divert the masses from what they believed the true\r\n     origin of the fire, Nero charged it upon the Christians, many\r\n     hundreds of whom were sacrificed to his fury. He was the last of\r\n     the Cæsars, and died by his own hand amid universal execrations, in\r\n     June, A.D. 68, four years after the destruction of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRYK SIENKIEWICZ\r\n\r\nThe fire began at the Circus Maximus, in that section which touches the\r\nPalatine and Cælian hill; it rushed on with inconceivable rapidity and\r\nfastened upon the whole centre of Rome. Since the time of Brennus never\r\nhad the city witnessed such an awful catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA freedman of Cæsar's, Phaon by name, ran panting into Nero's presence,\r\nshrieking: \"Rome is in flames! the conflagration is great.\"\r\n\r\nAll Cæsar's guests arose from their recumbent attitude. \"Ye gods! I\r\nshall see a burning city; now can I finish the _Troyade_,\" exclaimed\r\nNero, placing his lute aside. \"If I go at once, can I view the fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, the whole city is as a sea of flame; the smoke is\r\nsuffocatingly heavy and is destroying the people. The inhabitants faint\r\naway or rashly cast themselves into the fire, maddened with terror. All\r\nRome perishes.\" And Nero raised his hands and cried, \"Woe, woe to thee,\r\nthou sacred city of Priam!\"\r\n\r\nFires were frequent enough in Rome; during these conflagrations violence\r\nand robbery were rampant, particularly so in those sections of the city\r\ninhabited by needy half-barbarian peoples, a folk comprising rabble from\r\nevery part of the world. The fear of servile rebellion was like a\r\nnightmare, which had stifled Rome for many years. It was believed that\r\nhundreds of thousands of those people were thinking of the times of\r\nSpartacus, and merely waiting for a favorable moment to seize arms\r\nagainst their oppressors and Rome. Now the moment had come! Perhaps war\r\nand slaughter were raging in the city together with fire.\r\n\r\nIt was possible even that the prætorians had hurled themselves on the\r\ncity and were slaughtering at command of Cæsar. And that moment the hair\r\nrose on Vinicius' head from terror. He recalled all the conversations\r\nabout burning cities which for some time had been repeated at Cæsar's\r\ncourt with wonderful persistence; well he recalled Cæsar's complaints\r\nthat he was forced to describe a burning city without having seen an\r\nactual fire; his contemptuous answer to Tigellinus, who offered to burn\r\nAntium or an artificial wooden city; finally, his complaints against\r\nRome, and the pestilential alleys of the Subura.\r\n\r\nYes; truly Cæsar has commanded the burning of the city! Only he could\r\ngive such a command, as Tigellinus alone could accomplish it. But if\r\nRome is burning at command of Cæsar, who can be sure that the population\r\nwill not be slaughtered at his command? The monster is capable of just\r\nsuch a deed. Conflagration, a servile revolt, and slaughter! What a\r\nhorrible chaos, what a letting loose of destructive elements and horrid,\r\nuniversal frenzy!\r\n\r\nThe night had paled long since, the dawn had passed into light, and on\r\nall the nearer summits golden, rosy gleams were shining, which might\r\ncome either from burning Rome or the rising daylight. Vinicius ran to\r\nthe hill, the summit was reached, and then a terrible sight struck his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAll the lower region was covered with smoke, forming, as it were, one\r\ngigantic cloud lying close to the earth. In this cloud towns, aqueducts,\r\nvillas, trees, disappeared; but farther beyond this gray, ghastly plain\r\nthe city was burning on the hills. The conflagration had not the form of\r\na pillar of fire, as happens when a single building is burning, even\r\nwhen of the greatest size. That was a long belt, rather, shaped like the\r\nbelt of dawn. Above this belt rose a wave of smoke, in places entirely\r\nblack, in places looking rose-colored, in places like blood, in places\r\nturning in on itself, in some places inflated, in others squeezed and\r\nsquirming, like a serpent which is unwinding and extending.\r\n\r\nThat monstrous wave seemed at times to cover even the belt of fire,\r\nwhich became then as narrow as a ribbon; but later this ribbon\r\nilluminated the smoke from beneath, changing its lower rolls into waves\r\nof flame. The two extended from one side of the sky to the other, hiding\r\nits lower part, as at times a stretch of forest hides the horizon. The\r\nSabine hills were not visible in the least.\r\n\r\nIt seemed at the first glance of the eye that not only the city was\r\nburning, but the whole world, and that no living being could save itself\r\nfrom that ocean of flame and smoke. The wind blew with increasing\r\nstrength from the region of the fire, bringing the smell of burnt things\r\nand of smoke, which began to hide even nearer objects. Clear daylight\r\nhad come, and the sun lighted up the summits surrounding the Alban Lake.\r\n\r\nBut the bright golden rays of the morning appeared reddish and sickly\r\nthrough the haze. Vinicius, while descending toward Albanum, entered\r\nsmoke which was denser, less and less transparent. The town itself was\r\nburied in it thoroughly. The alarmed citizens had moved out to the\r\nstreet. It was a terror to think of what might be in Rome, when it was\r\ndifficult to breathe in Albanum.\r\n\r\nHe met increasing numbers of people, who had deserted the city and were\r\ngoing to the Alban hills; they had escaped the fire and wished to go\r\nbeyond the line of smoke. Before he had reached Ustrinum he had to\r\nslacken his pace because of the throng. Besides pedestrians with bundles\r\non their backs he met horses with packs, mules and vehicles laden with\r\neffects, and finally litters in which slaves were bearing the wealthier\r\ncitizens. The town of Ustrinum was so thronged with fugitives from Rome\r\nthat it was difficult to push through the crowd. On the market square,\r\nunder temple porticos, and on the streets were swarms of fugitives.\r\n\r\nHere and there people were erecting tents under which whole families\r\nwere to find shelter. Others settled down under the naked sky, shouting,\r\ncalling on the gods, or cursing the Fates. In the general terror it was\r\ndifficult to inquire about anything. New crowds of men, women, and\r\nchildren arrived from the direction of Rome every moment; these\r\nincreased the disorder and outcry. Some, gone astray in the throng,\r\nsought desperately those whom they had lost; others fought for a camping\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHalf-crazy shepherds from the Campania crowded to the town to hear news,\r\nor find profit in plunder made easy by the uproar. Here and there crowds\r\nof slaves of every nationality and gladiators fell to robbing houses and\r\nvillas in the town, and to fighting with the soldiers who appeared in\r\ndefence of the citizens.\r\n\r\nJunius, a friend of Vinicius, said, after a moment's hesitation, in a\r\nlow voice: \"I know that thou wilt not betray me, so I will tell thee\r\nthat this is no common fire. People were not permitted to save the\r\nCircus. When houses began to burn in every direction, I myself heard\r\nthousands of voices exclaiming, 'Death to those who save!' Certain\r\npeople ran through the city and hurled burning torches into buildings.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, people are revolting and crying that the city is\r\nburning at command. I can say nothing more. Woe to the city, woe to us\r\nall and to me! The tongue of man cannot tell what is happening there.\r\nPeople are perishing in flames or slaying one another in the throng.\r\nThis is the end of Rome!\"\r\n\r\nVinicius, nearing the walls, found it easier to reach Rome than\r\npenetrate to the middle of the city. It was difficult to push along the\r\nAppian Way, because of the throng of people. Houses, cemeteries, fields,\r\ngardens, and temples, lying on both sides of it, were turned into\r\ncamping places. In the temple of Mars, which stood near the Porta Appia,\r\nthe crowd had thrown down the doors, so as to find a refuge within\r\nduring night hours. In the cemeteries the larger monuments were seized,\r\nand battles fought in defence of them, which were carried to bloodshed.\r\nUstrinum with its disorder gave barely a slight foretaste of that which\r\nwas happening beneath the walls of the capital.\r\n\r\nAll regard for the dignity of law, for family ties, for difference of\r\nposition, had ceased. Gladiators drunk with wine seized in the Emporium,\r\ngathered in crowds and ran with wild shouts through the neighboring\r\nsquares, trampling, scattering, and robbing the people. A multitude of\r\nbarbarian slaves, exposed for sale in the city, escaped from the booths.\r\nFor them the burning and ruin of Rome were at once the end of slavery\r\nand the hour of revenge; so that when the permanent inhabitants, who had\r\nlost all they owned in the fire, stretched their hands to the gods in\r\ndespair, calling for rescue, these slaves with howls of delight\r\nscattered the crowds, dragged clothing from people's backs, and bore\r\naway the younger women. They were joined by other slaves serving in the\r\ncity from of old, wretches who had nothing on their bodies save woollen\r\ngirdles around their hips, dreadful figures from the alleys, who were\r\nhardly ever seen on the streets in the daytime, and whose existence in\r\nRome it was difficult to suspect.\r\n\r\nMen of this wild and unrestrained crowd--Asiatics, Africans, Greeks,\r\nThracians, Germans, Britons--howling in every language of the earth,\r\nraged, thinking that the hour had come in which they were free to reward\r\nthemselves for years of misery and suffering. In the midst of that\r\nsurging throng of humanity, in the glitter of day and of fire, shone the\r\nhelmets of prætorians, under whose protection the more peaceable\r\npopulation had taken refuge, and who in hand-to-hand battle had to meet\r\nthe raging multitude in many places. Vinicius had seen captured cities,\r\nbut never had his eyes beheld a spectacle in which despair, tears, pain,\r\ngroans, wild delight, madness, rage, and license were mingled together\r\nin such immeasurable chaos. Above this heaving, mad human multitude\r\nroared the fire, surging up to the hill-tops of the greatest city on\r\nearth, sending into the whirling throng its fiery breath, and covering\r\nit with smoke, through which it was impossible to see the blue sky.\r\n\r\nThe young tribune with supreme effort, and exposing his life every\r\nmoment, forced his way at last to the Appian Gate; but there he saw that\r\nhe could not reach the city through the division of the Porta Capena,\r\nnot merely because of the throng, but also because of the terrible heat\r\nfrom which the whole atmosphere was quivering inside the gate. Besides,\r\nthe bridge at the Porta Trigenia, opposite the temple of the Bona Dea,\r\ndid not exist yet, hence those who wished to go beyond the Tiber had to\r\npass through to the Pons Sublicius--that is, to pass around the Aventine\r\nthrough a part of the city covered now with one sea of flame. That was\r\nan impossibility. Vinicius understood that he must return toward\r\nUstrinum, turn from the Appian Way, cross the river below the city, and\r\ngo to the Via Portuensis, which led straight to the Trans-Tiber.\r\n\r\nThat was not easy because of the increasing disorder on the Appian Way.\r\nAt the fountain of Mercury, however, he saw a centurion who was known to\r\nhim. This man, at the head of a few tens of soldiers, was defending the\r\nprecinct of the temple; he commanded him to follow. Recognizing a\r\ntribune and an Augustian, the centurion did not dare to disobey the\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHe and his men were followed by curses and a shower of stones; but to\r\nthese he gave no heed, caring only to reach freer spaces at the\r\nearliest. Still he advanced with the greatest effort. People who had\r\nencamped would not move, and heaped loud curses on Cæsar and the\r\nprætorians. The throng assumed in places a threatening aspect. Thousands\r\nof voices accused Nero of burning the city. He and Poppæa were\r\nthreatened with death. Shouts of \"Buffoon, actor, matricide!\" were heard\r\nround about. Some shouted to drag him to the Tiber; others that Rome had\r\nshown patience enough. It was clear that were a leader found these\r\nthreats could be changed into open rebellion which might break out any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rage and despair of the crowd turned against the\r\nprætorians, who for another reason could not make their way out of the\r\ncrowd: the road was blocked by piles of goods, borne from the fire\r\npreviously, boxes, barrels of provisions, furniture the most costly,\r\nvessels, infants' cradles, beds, carts, hand-packs. Here and there they\r\nfought hand-to-hand; but the prætorians conquered the weaponless\r\nmultitude easily. After they had ridden with difficulty across the Viæ\r\nLatina, Numitia, Ardea, Lavinia, and Ostia, and passed around villas,\r\ngardens, cemeteries, and temples, Vinicius reached at last a village\r\ncalled Vicus Alexandri, beyond which he crossed the Tiber. There was\r\nmore open space at this spot and less smoke. From fugitives, of whom\r\nthere was no lack even there, he learned that only certain alleys of the\r\nTrans-Tiber were burning, but that surely nothing could resist the fury\r\nof the conflagration, since people were spreading the fire purposely,\r\nand permitted no one to quench it, declaring that they acted at command.\r\n\r\nThe young tribune had not the least doubt then that Cæsar had given\r\ncommand to burn Rome; and the vengeance which people demanded seemed to\r\nhim just and proper. What more could Mithradates or any of Rome's most\r\ninveterate enemies have done? The measure had been exceeded; his madness\r\nhad grown to be too enormous, and the existence of people too difficult\r\nbecause of him. All believed that Nero's hour had struck, that those\r\nruins into which the city was falling should and must overwhelm the\r\nmonstrous buffoon together with all those crimes of his. Should a man be\r\nfound of courage sufficient to stand at the head of the despairing\r\npeople, that might happen in a few hours. Here vengeful and daring\r\nthoughts began to fly through his head. But if he should do that?\r\n\r\nThe family of Vinicius, which till recent times counted a whole series\r\nof consuls, was known throughout Rome. The crowds needed only a name.\r\nOnce, when four hundred slaves of the prefect Pedanius Secundus were\r\nsentenced, Rome reached the verge of rebellion and civil war. What would\r\nhappen to-day in view of a dreadful calamity surpassing almost\r\neverything which Rome had undergone in the course of eight centuries?\r\nWhoever calls the _quirites_ to arms, thought Vinicius, will overthrow\r\nNero undoubtedly, and clothe himself in purple.\r\n\r\nThe Trans-Tiber was full of smoke, and crowds of fugitives made it more\r\ndifficult to reach the interior of the place, since people, having more\r\ntime there, had saved greater quantities of goods. The main street\r\nitself was in many parts filled completely, and around the Naumachia\r\nAugusta great heaps were piled up. Narrow alleys, in which smoke had\r\ncollected more densely, were simply impassable. The inhabitants were\r\nfleeing in thousands. On the way Vinicius saw wonderful sights. More\r\nthan once two rivers of people, flowing in opposite directions, met in a\r\nnarrow passage, stopped each other, men fought hand-to-hand, struck and\r\ntrampled one another. Families lost one another in the uproar; mothers\r\ncalled on their children despairingly. The young tribune's hair stood on\r\nend at thought of what must happen nearer the fire.\r\n\r\nAmid shouts and howls it was difficult to inquire about anything or\r\nunderstand what was said. At times new columns of smoke from beyond the\r\nriver rolled toward them, smoke black and so heavy that it moved near\r\nthe ground, hiding houses, people, and every object, just as night does.\r\nThe fervor of a July day, increased by the heat of the burning parts of\r\nthe city, became unendurable. Smoke pained the eyes; breath failed in\r\nmen's breasts. Even the inhabitants who, hoping that the fire would not\r\ncross the river, had remained in their houses so far, began to leave\r\nthem, and the throng increased hourly. The prætorians accompanying\r\nVinicius were in the rear. In the crush some one wounded his horse with\r\na hammer; the beast threw up its bloody head, reared, and refused\r\nobedience. The crowd recognized in Vinicius an Augustian by his rich\r\ntunic, and at once cries were raised round about, \"Death to Nero and his\r\nincendiaries!\" This was a moment of terrible danger; hundreds of hands\r\nwere stretched toward Vinicius; but his frightened horse bore him away,\r\ntrampling people as he went, and the next moment a new wave of black\r\nsmoke rolled in and filled the street with darkness. Vinicius, seeing\r\nthat he could not ride past, sprang to the earth and rushed forward on\r\nfoot, slipping along walls, and at times waiting till the fleeing\r\nmultitude passed him. He said to himself in spirit that these were vain\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nAt times he stopped and rubbed his eyes. Tearing off the edge of his\r\ntunic, he covered his nose and mouth with it and ran on. As he\r\napproached the river the heat increased terribly. Vinicius, knowing that\r\nthe fire had begun at the Circus Maximus, thought at first that that\r\nheat came from its cinders and from the Forum Boarium and the Velabrum,\r\nwhich, situated near by, must be also in flames. But the heat was\r\ngrowing unendurable. One old man on crutches and fleeing, the last whom\r\nVinicius noticed, cried: \"Go not near the bridge of Cestius! The whole\r\nisland is on fire!\" It was, indeed, impossible to be deceived any\r\nlonger. At the turn toward the Vicus Judæorum the young tribune saw\r\nflames amid clouds of smoke. Not only the island was burning, but the\r\nTrans-Tiber and the other end of the street on which he ran.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of the flames was more terrible than the roar of wild\r\nbeasts, and the hour had come now in which he must think of his own\r\nsafety, for the river of fire was flowing nearer and nearer from the\r\ndirection of the island, and rolls of smoke covered the alley almost\r\ncompletely. The taper which he carried was quenched from the current of\r\nair. Vinicius rushed to the street, and ran at full speed toward the Via\r\nPortuensis, whence he had come; the fire seemed to pursue him with\r\nburning breath, now surrounding him with fresh clouds of smoke, now\r\ncovering him with sparks, which fell on his hair, neck, and clothing.\r\nThe tunic began to smoulder on him in places; he cared not, but ran\r\nforward lest he might be stifled from smoke. He had the taste of soot\r\nand burning in his mouth; his throat and lungs were as if on fire. The\r\nblood rushed to his head, and at moments all things, even the smoke\r\nitself, seemed red to him.\r\n\r\nThen he thought: \"This is living fire! Better throw myself upon the\r\nground and quickly perish.\" The running tortured him more and more. His\r\nhead, neck, and shoulders were streaming with sweat, which scalded like\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nBut he ran on as if drunk, staggering from one side of the street to the\r\nother. Meanwhile something changed in that monstrous conflagration which\r\nhad embraced the giant city. Everything which till then had only\r\nglimmered, burst forth visibly into one sea of flame; the wind had\r\nceased to bring smoke. That smoke which had collected in the streets\r\nwas borne away by a mad whirl of heated air. That whirl drove with it\r\nmillions of sparks, so that Vinicius was running in a fiery cloud, as it\r\nwere. But he was able to see before him all the better, and in a moment,\r\nalmost when he was ready to fall, he saw the end of the street. That\r\nsight gave him fresh strength. Passing the corner, he found himself in a\r\nstreet which led to the Via Portuensis and the Codetan Field. The sparks\r\nceased to drive him. He understood that if he could run to the Via\r\nPortuensis he was safe, even were he to faint on it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the street he saw again a cloud, as it seemed, which\r\nstopped the exit. \"If that is smoke,\" thought he, \"I cannot pass.\" He\r\nran with the remnant of his strength. On the way he threw off his tunic,\r\nwhich, on fire from the sparks, was burning him like the shirt of\r\nNessus, having only a _capitium_ around his head and before his mouth.\r\nWhen he had run farther, he saw that what he had taken for smoke was\r\ndust, from which rose a multitude of cries and voices.\r\n\r\n\"The rabble are plundering houses,\" thought Vinicius. But he ran toward\r\nthe voices. In any case people were there; they might assist him. In\r\nthis hope he shouted for aid with all his might before he reached them.\r\nBut this was his last effort. It grew redder still in his eyes, breath\r\nfailed his lungs, strength failed his bones; he fell.\r\n\r\nThey heard him, however, or rather saw him. Two men ran with gourds full\r\nof water. Vinicius, who had fallen from exhaustion, but had not lost\r\nconsciousness, seized a gourd with both hands and emptied one-half of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said he; \"place me on my feet; I can walk on alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe other laborer poured water on his head; the two not only placed him\r\non his feet, but raised him from the ground and carried him to the\r\nothers, who surrounded him and asked if he had suffered seriously. This\r\ntenderness astonished Vinicius.\r\n\r\n\"People, who are ye?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"We are breaking down houses, so that the fire may not reach the Via\r\nPortuensis,\" answered one of the laborers.\r\n\r\n\"Ye came to my aid when I had fallen. Thanks to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not permitted to refuse aid,\" answered a number of voices.\r\n\r\nVinicius, who from early morning had seen brutal crowds slaying and\r\nrobbing, looked with more attention on the faces around him and said:\r\n\r\n\"May Christ reward you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Praise to his name!\" exclaimed a whole chorus of voices.\r\n\r\nIt was evening, but one could see as in daylight, for the conflagration\r\nhad increased. It seemed that not single parts of the city were burning,\r\nbut the whole city through the length and the breadth of it. The sky was\r\nred as far as the eye could see it, and that night in the world was a\r\nred night.\r\n\r\nThe light from the burning city filled the sky as far as human eye could\r\nreach. The moon rose large and full from behind the mountains, and,\r\ninflamed at once by the glare, took on the color of heated brass. It\r\nseemed to look with amazement on the world-ruling city which was\r\nperishing. In the rose-colored abysses of heaven rose-colored stars were\r\nglittering; but in distinction from usual nights the earth was brighter\r\nthan the heavens. Rome, like a giant pile, illuminated the whole\r\nCampania.\r\n\r\nIn the bloody light were seen distant mountains, towns, villas, temples,\r\nmonuments, and the aqueducts stretching toward the city from all the\r\nadjacent hills; on the aqueducts were swarms of people who had gathered\r\nthere for safety or to gaze at the burning. Meanwhile the dreadful\r\nelement was embracing new divisions of the city. It was impossible to\r\ndoubt that criminal hands were spreading the fire, since new\r\nconflagrations were breaking out all the time in places remote from the\r\nprincipal fire.\r\n\r\nFrom the heights on which Rome was founded the flames flowed like waves\r\nof the sea into the valleys densely occupied by houses--houses of five\r\nand six stories, full of shops, booths, movable wooden amphitheatres,\r\nbuilt to accommodate various spectacles; and finally storehouses of\r\nwood, olives, grain, nuts, pine cones, the kernels of which nourished\r\nthe more needy population, and clothing, which through Cæsar's favor was\r\ndistributed from time to time among the rabble huddled into narrow\r\nalleys. In those places the fire, finding abundance of inflammable\r\nmaterials, became almost a series of explosions, and took possession of\r\nwhole streets with unheard-of rapidity. People encamping outside the\r\ncity or standing on the aqueducts knew from the color of the flame what\r\nwas burning. The furious power of the wind carried forth from the fiery\r\ngulf thousands and millions of burning shells of walnuts and almonds,\r\nwhich, shooting suddenly into the sky, like countless flocks of bright\r\nbutterflies, burst with a crackling, or, driven by the wind, fell in\r\nother parts of the city, on aqueducts and fields beyond Rome.\r\n\r\nAll thought of rescue seemed out of place; confusion increased every\r\nmoment, for on one side the population of the city was fleeing through\r\nevery gate to places outside; on the other the fire had lured in\r\nthousands of people from the neighborhood, such as dwellers in small\r\ntowns, peasants, and half-wild shepherds of the Campania brought in by\r\nhope of plunder. The shout, \"Rome is perishing!\" did not leave the lips\r\nof the crowd; the ruin of the city seemed at that time to end every rule\r\nand loosen all bonds which hitherto had joined people in a single\r\nintegrity. The mob, in which slaves were more numerous, cared nothing\r\nfor the lordship of Rome. Destruction of the city could only free them;\r\nhence here and there they assumed a threatening attitude.\r\n\r\nViolence and robbery were extending. It seemed that only the spectacle\r\nof the perishing city arrested attention, and restrained for the moment\r\nan outburst of slaughter, which would begin as soon as the city was\r\nturned into ruins. Hundreds of thousands of slaves, forgetting that\r\nRome, besides temples and walls, possessed some tens of legions in all\r\nparts of the world, appeared merely waiting for a watchword and a\r\nleader. People began to mention the name of Spartacus; but Spartacus was\r\nnot alive. Meanwhile citizens assembled and armed themselves each with\r\nwhat he could. The most monstrous reports were current at all the gates.\r\nSome declared that Vulcan, commanded by Jupiter, was destroying the city\r\nwith fire from beneath the earth; others that Vesta was taking vengeance\r\nfor Rubria. People with these convictions did not care to save anything,\r\nbut, besieging the temples, implored mercy of the gods. It was repeated\r\nmost generally, however, that Cæsar had given command to burn Rome, so\r\nas to free himself from odors which rose from the Subura, and build a\r\nnew city under the name of Neronia. Rage seized the populace at thought\r\nof this; and if, as Vinicius believed, a leader had taken advantage of\r\nthat outburst of hatred, Nero's hour would have struck whole years\r\nbefore it did.\r\n\r\nIt was said also that Cæsar had gone mad, that he would command\r\nprætorians and gladiators to fall upon the people and make a general\r\nslaughter. Others swore by the gods that wild beasts had been let out of\r\nall the _vivaria_ at Bronze-beard's command. Men had seen on the streets\r\nlions with burning manes, and mad elephants and bisons, trampling down\r\npeople in crowds. There was even some truth in this; for in certain\r\nplaces elephants, at sight of the approaching fire, had burst the\r\nvivaria, and, gaining their freedom, rushed away from the fire in wild\r\nfright, destroying everything before them like a tempest. Public report\r\nestimated at tens of thousands the number of persons who had perished in\r\nthe conflagration. In truth a great number had perished. There were\r\npeople who, losing all their property, or those dearest their hearts,\r\nthrew themselves willingly into the flames from despair. Others were\r\nsuffocated by smoke. In the middle of the city, between the Capitol on\r\none side, and the Quirinal, the Viminal, and the Esquiline on the other,\r\nas also between the Palatine and the Cælian hill, where the streets were\r\nmost densely occupied, the fire began in so many places at once that\r\nwhole crowds of people, while fleeing in one direction, struck\r\nunexpectedly on a new wall of fire in front of them, and died a dreadful\r\ndeath in a deluge of flame.\r\n\r\nIn terror, in distraction and bewilderment, people knew not where to\r\nflee. The streets were obstructed with goods and in many narrow places\r\nwere simply closed. Those who took refuge in those markets and squares\r\nof the city where the Flavian Amphitheatre stood afterward, near the\r\ntemple of the Earth, near the Portico of Silvia, and higher up, at the\r\ntemples of Juno and Lucinia, between the Clivus Virbius and the old\r\nEsquiline gate, perished from heat, surrounded by a sea of fire. In\r\nplaces not reached by the flames were found afterward hundreds of\r\nbodies burned to a crisp, though here and there unfortunates tore up\r\nflat stones and half buried themselves in defence against the heat.\r\nHardly a family inhabiting the centre of the city survived in full;\r\nhence along the walls, at the gates, on all roads were heard howls of\r\ndespairing women, calling on the dear names of those who had perished in\r\nthe throng or the fire.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while some were imploring the gods, others blasphemed them\r\nbecause of this awful catastrophe. Old men were seen coming from the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Liberator, stretching forth their hands and crying,\r\n\"If thou be a liberator, save thy altars and the city!\" But despair\r\nturned mainly against the old Roman gods, who, in the minds of the\r\npopulace, were bound to watch over the city more carefully than others.\r\nThey had proved themselves powerless; hence were insulted. On the other\r\nhand, it happened on the Via Asinaria that when a company of Egyptian\r\npriests appeared conducting a statue of Isis, which they had saved from\r\nthe temple near the Porta Cælimontana, a crowd of people rushed among\r\nthe priests, attached themselves to the chariot, which they drew to the\r\nAppian gate, and seizing the statue placed it in the temple of Mars,\r\noverwhelming the priests of that deity who dared to resist them.\r\n\r\nIn other places people invoked Serapis, Baal, or Jehovah, whose\r\nadherents, swarming out of the alleys in the neighborhood of the Subura\r\nand the Trans-Tiber, filled with shouts and uproar the fields near the\r\nwalls. In their cries were heard tones as if of triumph; when,\r\ntherefore, some of the citizens joined the chorus and glorified \"the\r\nLord of the World,\" others, indignant at this glad shouting, strove to\r\nrepress it by violence. Here and there hymns were heard, sung by men in\r\nthe bloom of life, by old men, by women and children--hymns wonderful\r\nand solemn, whose meaning they understood not, but in which were\r\nrepeated from moment to moment the words \"Behold the Judge cometh in the\r\nday of wrath and disaster.\" Thus this deluge of restless and sleepless\r\npeople encircled the burning city, like a tempest-driven sea. But\r\nneither despair nor blasphemy nor hymn helped in any way.\r\n\r\nThe destruction seemed as irresistible, perfect, and pitiless as\r\nPredestination itself. Around Pompey's Amphitheatre stores of hemp\r\ncaught fire, and ropes used in circuses, arenas, and every kind of\r\nmachine at the games, and with them the adjoining buildings containing\r\nbarrels of pitch with which ropes were smeared. In a few hours all that\r\npart of the city beyond which lay the Campus Martius was so lighted by\r\nbright yellow flames that for a time it seemed to the spectators, only\r\nhalf conscious from terror, that in the general ruin the order of night\r\nand day had been lost, and that they were looking at sunshine. But later\r\na monstrous bloody gleam extinguished all other colors of flame. From\r\nthe sea of fire shot up to the heated sky gigantic fountains, and\r\npillars of flame spreading at their summits into fiery branches and\r\nfeathers; then the wind bore them away, turned them into golden threads,\r\ninto hair, into sparks, and swept them on over the Campania toward the\r\nAlban hills. The night became brighter; the air itself seemed\r\npenetrated, not only with light, but with flame. The Tiber flowed on as\r\nliving fire. The hapless city was turned into one pandemonium. The\r\nconflagration seized more and more space, took hills by storm, flooded\r\nlevel places, drowned valleys, raged, roared, and thundered.\r\n\r\nThe city burned on. The Circus Maximus had fallen in ruins. Entire\r\nstreets and alleys in parts which began to burn first were falling in\r\nturn. After every fall pillars of flame rose for a time to the very sky.\r\nThe wind had changed, and blew now with mighty force from the sea,\r\nbearing toward the Cælian, the Esquiline, and the Viminal rivers of\r\nflame, brands, and cinders. Still the authorities provided for rescue.\r\nAt command of Tigellinus, who had hastened from Antium the third day\r\nbefore, houses on the Esquiline were torn down so that the fire,\r\nreaching empty spaces, died of itself. That was, however, undertaken\r\nsolely to save a remnant of the city; to save that which was burning was\r\nnot to be thought of. There was need also to guard against further\r\nresults of the ruin. Incalculable wealth had perished in Rome; all the\r\nproperty of its citizens had vanished; hundreds of thousands of people\r\nwere wandering in utter want outside the walls. Hunger had begun to\r\npinch this throng the second day, for the immense stores of provisions\r\nin the city had burned with it. In the universal disorder and in the\r\ndestruction of authority no one had thought of furnishing new supplies.\r\nOnly after the arrival of Tigellinus were proper orders sent to Ostia;\r\nbut meanwhile the people had grown more threatening.\r\n\r\nBesides flour, as much baked bread as possible was brought at his\r\ncommand, not only from Ostia, but from all towns and neighboring\r\nvillages. When the first instalment came at night to the Emporium, the\r\npeople broke the chief gate toward the Aventine, seized all supplies in\r\nthe twinkle of an eye, and caused terrible disturbance. In the light of\r\nthe conflagration they fought for loaves, and trampled many of them into\r\nthe earth. Flour from torn bags whitened like snow the whole space from\r\nthe granary to the arches of Drusus and Germanicus. The uproar continued\r\ntill soldiers seized the building and dispersed the crowd with arrows\r\nand missiles.\r\n\r\nNever since the invasion by the Gauls under Brennus had Rome beheld such\r\ndisaster. People in despair compared the two conflagrations. But in the\r\ntime of Brennus the Capitol remained. Now the Capitol was encircled by a\r\ndreadful wreath of flame. The marbles, it is true, were not blazing; but\r\nat night, when the wind swept the flames aside for a moment, rows of\r\ncolumns in the lofty sanctuary of Jove were visible, red as glowing\r\ncoals. In the days of Brennus, moreover, Rome had a disciplined integral\r\npeople, attached to the city and its altars; but now crowds of a\r\nmany-tongued populace roamed nomad-like around the walls of burning\r\nRome, people composed for the greater part of slaves and freedmen,\r\nexcited, disorderly, and ready, under the pressure of want, to turn\r\nagainst authority and the city.\r\n\r\nBut the very immensity of the fire which terrified every heart disarmed\r\nthe crowd in a certain measure. After fire might come famine and\r\ndisease; and to complete the misfortune the terrible heat of July had\r\nappeared. It was impossible to breathe air inflamed both by fire and the\r\nsun. Night brought no relief; on the contrary, it presented a hell.\r\nDuring daylight an awful and ominous spectacle met the eye. In the\r\ncentre a giant city on heights was turned into a roaring volcano; round\r\nabout as far as the Alban hills was one boundless camp, formed of sheds,\r\ntents, huts, vehicles, bales, packs, stands, fires, and all covered\r\nwith smoke and dust, lighted by sun rays reddened by passing through\r\nsmoke--everything filled with roars, shouts, threats, hatred, and\r\nterror, a monstrous swarm of men, women, and children. Mingled with\r\n_quirites_ were Greeks, shaggy men from the North with blue eyes,\r\nAfricans, and Asiatics; among citizens were slaves, freedmen,\r\ngladiators, merchants, mechanics, servants, and soldiers--a real sea of\r\npeople, flowing around the island of fire.\r\n\r\nVarious reports moved this sea as wind does a real one. These reports\r\nwere favorable and unfavorable. People told of immense supplies of wheat\r\nand clothing to be brought to the Emporium and distributed gratis. It\r\nwas said, too, that provinces in Asia and Africa would be stripped of\r\ntheir wealth at Cæsar's command, and the treasures thus gained be given\r\nto the inhabitants of Rome, so that each man might build his own\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nBut it was noised about also that water in the aqueducts had been\r\npoisoned; that Nero intended to annihilate the city, destroy the\r\ninhabitants to the last person, then move to Greece or to Egypt, and\r\nrule the world from a new place. Each report ran with lightning speed,\r\nand each found belief among the rabble, causing outbursts of hope,\r\nanger, terror, or rage. Finally a kind of fever mastered those nomadic\r\nthousands. The belief of Christians that the end of the world by fire\r\nwas at hand spread even among adherents of the gods and extended daily.\r\nPeople fell into torpor or madness. In clouds lighted by the burning,\r\ngods were seen gazing down on the ruin; hands were stretched toward\r\nthose gods then to implore pity or send them curses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile soldiers, aided by a certain number of inhabitants, continued\r\nto tear down houses on the Esquiline and the Cælian, as also in the\r\nTrans-Tiber; these divisions were saved therefore in considerable part.\r\nBut in the city itself were destroyed incalculable treasures accumulated\r\nthrough centuries of conquest--priceless works of art, splendid temples,\r\nthe most precious monuments of Rome's past and Rome's glory. They\r\nforesaw that of all Rome there would remain barely a few parts on the\r\nedges, and that hundreds of thousands of people would be without a roof.\r\nSome spread reports that the soldiers were tearing down houses, not to\r\nstop the fire, but to prevent any part of the city from being saved.\r\nTigellinus sent courier after courier to Antium, imploring Cæsar in each\r\nletter to come and calm the despairing people with his presence. But\r\nNero moved only when fire had seized the _domus transitoria_ and he\r\nhurried so as not to miss the moment in which the conflagration should\r\nbe at its highest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile fire had reached the Via Nomentana, but turned from it at once\r\nwith a change of wind toward the Via Lata and the Tiber. It surrounded\r\nthe Capitol, spread along the Forum Boarium, destroyed everything which\r\nit had spared before, and approached the Palatine a second time.\r\n\r\nTigellinus, assembling all the prætorian forces, despatched courier\r\nafter courier to Cæsar with an announcement that he would lose nothing\r\nof the grandeur of the spectacle, for the fire had increased.\r\n\r\nBut Nero, who was on the road, wished to come at night, so as to sate\r\nhimself all the better with a view of the perishing capital. Therefore\r\nhe halted, in the neighborhood of Aqua Albana, and, summoning to his\r\ntent the tragedian Aliturus, decided with his aid on posture, look, and\r\nexpression; learned fitting gestures, disputing with the actor\r\nstubbornly whether at the words, \"O sacred city, which seemed more\r\nenduring than Ida,\" he was to raise both hands, or, holding in one the\r\n_forminga_, drop it by his side, and raise only the other. This question\r\nseemed to him then more important than all others. Starting at last\r\nabout nightfall, he took counsel of Petronius also whether to the lines\r\ndescribing the catastrophe he might add a few magnificent blasphemies\r\nagainst the gods, and whether, considered from the standpoint of art,\r\nthey would not have rushed spontaneously from the mouth of a man in such\r\na position, a man who was losing his birthplace.\r\n\r\nAt length he approached the walls about midnight with his numerous\r\ncourt, composed of whole detachments of nobles, senators, knights,\r\nfreedmen, slaves, women, and children. Sixteen thousand prætorians,\r\narranged in line of battle along the road, guarded the peace and safety\r\nof his entrance, and held the excited populace at a proper distance. The\r\npeople cursed, shouted, and hissed on seeing the retinue, but dared not\r\nattack it. In many places, however, applause was given by the rabble,\r\nwhich, owning nothing, had lost nothing in the fire, and which hoped for\r\na more bountiful distribution than usual of wheat, olives, clothing, and\r\nmoney. Finally, shouts, hissing, and applause were drowned in the blare\r\nof horns and trumpets, which Tigellinus had caused to be sounded.\r\n\r\nNero, on arriving at the Ostian gate, halted, and said: \"Houseless ruler\r\nof a houseless people, where shall I lay my unfortunate head for the\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had passed the Clivus Delphini, he ascended the Appian aqueduct\r\non steps prepared purposely. After him followed the Augustians and a\r\nchoir of singers, bearing _citharæ_, lutes, and other musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nAnd all held the breath in their breasts, waiting to learn if he would\r\nsay some great words, which for their own safety they ought to remember.\r\nBut he stood solemn, silent, in a purple mantle and a wreath of golden\r\nlaurels, gazing at the raging might of the flames.\r\n\r\nWhen Terpnos gave him a golden lute, he raised his eyes to the sky,\r\nfilled with the conflagration, as if he were waiting for inspiration.\r\nThe people pointed at him from afar as he stood in the bloody gleam. In\r\nthe distance fiery serpents were hissing. The ancient and most sacred\r\nedifices were in flames; the temple of Hercules, reared by Evander, was\r\nburning; the temple of Jupiter Stator was burning, the temple of Luna,\r\nbuilt by Servius Tullius, the house of Numa Pompilius, the sanctuary of\r\nVesta with the _penates_ of the Roman people; through waving flames the\r\nCapitol appeared at intervals; the past and the spirit of Rome were\r\nburning. But Cæsar was there with a lute in his hand and a theatrical\r\nexpression on his face, not thinking of his perishing country, but of\r\nhis posture and the prophetic words with which he might describe best\r\nthe greatness of the catastrophe, rouse most admiration, and receive the\r\nwarmest plaudits.\r\n\r\nHe detested that city, he detested its inhabitants, he loved only his\r\nown songs and verses; hence he rejoiced in heart that at last he saw a\r\ntragedy like that which he was writing. The poet was happy, the\r\ndeclaimer felt inspired, the seeker for emotions was delighted at the\r\nawful sight, and thought with rapture that even the destruction of Troy\r\nwas as nothing if compared with the destruction of that giant city. What\r\nmore could he desire? There was world-ruling Rome in flames, and he,\r\nstanding on the arches of the aqueduct with a golden lute, conspicuous,\r\npurple, admired, magnificent, and poetic. Down below, somewhere in the\r\ndarkness, the people are muttering and storming; let them mutter! Ages\r\nwill elapse, thousands of years will pass, but mankind will remember and\r\nglorify the poet who that night sang the fall and the burning of Troy.\r\nWhat was Homer compared with him? What Apollo himself with his\r\nhollowed-out lute?\r\n\r\nHere he raised his hands, and, striking the strings, with an exaggerated\r\ntheatrical gesture pronounced the words of Priam:\r\n\r\n\"O nest of my fathers, O dear cradle!\" His voice in the open air, with\r\nthe roar of the conflagration, and the distant murmur of crowding\r\nthousands, seemed marvellously weak, uncertain, and low, and the sound\r\nof the accompaniment like the buzzing of insects. But senators,\r\ndignitaries, and Augustians, assembled on the aqueduct, bowed their\r\nheads and listened in silent rapture. He sang long, and his motive was\r\never sadder. At moments, when he stopped to catch breath, the chorus of\r\nsingers repeated the last verse; then Nero cast the tragic _syrma_ from\r\nhis shoulder with a gesture learned from Aliturus, struck the lute, and\r\nsang on. When he had finished the lines composed, he improvised, using\r\ngrandiose comparisons in the spectacle unfolded before him. His face\r\nbegan to change. He was not moved, it is true, by the destruction of his\r\ncountry's capital; but he was delighted and moved with the pathos of his\r\nown words to such a degree that his eyes filled with tears on a sudden.\r\n\r\nAt last he dropped the lute to his feet with a clatter, and, wrapping\r\nhimself in the syrma, stood as if petrified, like one of those statues\r\nof Niobe which ornamented the courtyard of the Palatine. Soon a storm of\r\napplause broke the silence. But in the distance this was answered by the\r\nhowling of multitudes. No one doubted then that Cæsar had given command\r\nto burn the city, so as to afford himself a spectacle and sing a song at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTACITUS\r\n\r\nThere followed a dreadful disaster, whether fortuitously or by the\r\nwicked contrivance of the prince is not determined, for both are\r\nasserted by historians; but of all the calamities which ever befell this\r\ncity from the rage of fire, this was the most terrible and severe. It\r\nbroke out in that part of the Circus which is contiguous to mounts\r\nPalatine and Cælius, where, by reason of shops in which were kept such\r\ngoods as minister aliment to fire, the moment it commenced it acquired\r\nstrength, and, being accelerated by the wind, it spread at once through\r\nthe whole extent of the Circus: for neither were the houses secured by\r\nenclosures nor the temples environed with walls, nor was there any other\r\nobstacle to intercept its progress; but the flame, spreading every way\r\nimpetuously, invaded first the lower regions of the city, then mounted\r\nto the higher; then again ravaging the lower, it baffled every effort to\r\nextinguish it, by the rapidity of its destructive course, and from the\r\nliability of the city to conflagration, in consequence of the narrow and\r\nintricate alleys, and the irregularity of the streets in ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the wailings of terrified women, the infirm condition of the\r\naged, and the helplessness of childhood; such as strove to provide for\r\nthemselves and those who labored to assist others; these dragging the\r\nfeeble, those waiting for them; some hurrying, others lingering;\r\naltogether created a scene of universal confusion and embarrassment: and\r\nwhile they looked back upon the danger in their rear, they often found\r\nthemselves beset before and on their sides; or, if they had escaped into\r\nthe quarters adjoining, these, too, were already seized by the devouring\r\nflames; even the parts which they believed remote and exempt were found\r\nto be in the same distress. At last, not knowing what to shun or where\r\nto seek sanctuary, they crowded the streets and lay along in the open\r\nfields. Some, from the loss of their whole substance, even the means of\r\ntheir daily sustenance, others, from affection for their relations whom\r\nthey had not been able to snatch from the flames, suffered themselves to\r\nperish in them, though they had opportunity to escape. Neither dared any\r\nman offer to check the fire, so repeated were the menaces of many who\r\nforbade to extinguish it; and because others openly threw firebrands,\r\nwith loud declarations \"that they had one who authorized them\"; whether\r\nthey did it that they might plunder with the less restraint or in\r\nconsequence of orders given.\r\n\r\nNero, who was at that juncture sojourning at Antium, did not return to\r\nthe city till the fire approached that quarter of his house which\r\nconnected the palace with the gardens of Mæcenas; nor could it, however,\r\nbe prevented from devouring the house and palace and everything around.\r\nBut for the relief of the people, thus destitute and driven from their\r\ndwellings, he opened the field of Mars and the monumental edifices\r\nerected by Agrippa, and even his own gardens. He likewise reared\r\ntemporary houses for the reception of the forlorn multitude, and from\r\nOstia and the neighboring cities were brought, up the river, household\r\nnecessaries, and the price of grain was reduced to three sesterces the\r\nmeasure. All which proceedings, though of a popular character, were\r\nthrown away, because a rumor had become universally current \"that at the\r\nvery time when the city was in flames, Nero, going on the stage of his\r\nprivate theatre, sang _The Destruction of Troy_, assimilating the\r\npresent disaster to that catastrophe of ancient times.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, on the sixth day, the conflagration was stayed at the foot of\r\nEsquiliæ, by pulling down an immense quantity of buildings, so that an\r\nopen space, and, as it were, void air, might check the raging element by\r\nbreaking the continuity. But ere the consternation had subsided the fire\r\nbroke out afresh, with no little violence, but in regions more spacious,\r\nand therefore with less destruction of human life; but more extensive\r\nhavoc was made of the temples and the porticoes dedicated to amusement.\r\nThis conflagration, too, was the subject of more censorious remark, as\r\nit arose in the Æmilian possessions of Tigellinus, and Nero seemed to\r\naim at the glory of building a new city and calling it by his own name;\r\nfor, of the fourteen sections into which Rome is divided, four were\r\nstill standing entire, three were levelled with the ground, and in the\r\nseven others there remained only here and there a few remnants of\r\nhouses, shattered and half consumed.\r\n\r\nIt were no very easy task to recount the number of tenements and temples\r\nwhich were lost; but the following, most venerable for antiquity and\r\nsanctity, were consumed: that dedicated by Servius Tullius to the Moon;\r\nthe temple and great altar consecrated by Evander the Arcadian to\r\nHercules while present; the chapel vowed by Romulus to Jupiter Stator;\r\nthe palace of Numa with the temple of Vesta, and in it the tutelar gods\r\nof Rome. Moreover, the treasures accumulated by so many victories, the\r\nbeautiful productions of Greek artists, ancient writings of authors\r\ncelebrated for genius, and till then preserved entire, were consumed;\r\nand though great was the beauty of the city, in its renovated form, the\r\nolder inhabitants remembered many decorations of the ancient which could\r\nnot be replaced in the modern city. There were some who remarked that\r\nthe commencement of this fire showed itself on the fourteenth before the\r\ncalends of July, the day on which the Senones set fire to the captured\r\ncity. Others carried their investigation so far as to determine that an\r\nequal number of years, months, and days intervened between the two\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nTo proceed: Nero appropriated to his own purposes the ruins of his\r\ncountry,[27] and founded upon them a palace; in which the old-fashioned,\r\nand, in those luxurious times, common ornaments of gold and precious\r\nstones, were not so much the objects of attraction as lands and lakes;\r\nin one part, woods like vast deserts; in another part, open spaces and\r\nexpansive prospects. The projectors and superintendents of this plan\r\nwere Severus and Celer, men of such ingenuity and daring enterprise as\r\nto attempt to conquer by art the obstacles of nature and fool away the\r\ntreasures of the prince. They had even undertaken to sink a navigable\r\ncanal from the lake Avernus to the mouth of the Tiber, over an arid\r\nshore or through opposing mountains; nor indeed does there occur\r\nanything of a humid nature for supplying water except the Pomptine\r\nmarshes; the rest is either craggy rock or a parched soil; and had it\r\neven been possible to break through these obstructions, the toil had\r\nbeen intolerable and disproportioned to the object. Nero, however, who\r\nlonged to achieve things that exceeded credibility, exerted all his\r\nmight to perforate the mountains adjoining to Avernus, and to this day\r\nthere remain traces of his abortive project.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the old site not occupied by his palace was laid out,\r\nnot as after the Gallic fire without discrimination and regularity, but\r\nwith the lines of streets measured out, broad spaces left for transit,\r\nthe height of the buildings limited, open areas left, and porticoes\r\nadded to protect the front of the clustered dwellings: these porticoes\r\nNero engaged to rear at his own expense, and then to deliver to each\r\nproprietor the areas about them cleared. He, moreover, proposed rewards\r\nproportioned to every man's rank and private substance, and fixed a day\r\nwithin which, if their houses, single and clustered, were finished, they\r\nshould receive them. He appointed the marshes of Ostia for a receptacle\r\nof the rubbish, and that the vessels which had conveyed grain up the\r\nTiber should return laden with rubbish; that the buildings themselves\r\nshould be raised a certain portion of their height without beams, and\r\narched with stone from the quarries of Gabii or Alba, that stone being\r\nproof against fire; that over the water springs, which had been\r\nimproperly intercepted by private individuals, overseers should be\r\nplaced, to provide for their flowing in greater abundance, and in a\r\ngreater number of places, for the supply of the public; that every\r\nhousekeeper should have in his yard means for extinguishing fire,\r\nneither should there be party walls, but every house should be enclosed\r\nby its own walls.[28]\r\n\r\nThese regulations, which were favorably received, in consideration of\r\ntheir utility, were also a source of beauty to the new city; yet some\r\nthere were who believed that the ancient form was more conducive to\r\nhealth, as from the narrowness of the streets and the height of the\r\nbuildings the rays of the sun were more excluded; whereas now, the\r\nspacious breadth of the streets, without any shade to protect it, was\r\nmore intensely heated in warm weather.\r\n\r\nSuch were the provisions made by human counsels. The gods were next\r\naddressed with expiations, and recourse had to the sibyl's books. By\r\nadmonition from them to Vulcan, Ceres, and Proserpina, supplicatory\r\nsacrifices were made, and Juno propitiated by the matrons, first in the\r\nCapitol, then upon the nearest shore, where, by water drawn from the\r\nsea, the temple and image of the goddess were besprinkled; the ceremony\r\nof placing the goddess in her sacred chair, and her vigil, were\r\ncelebrated by ladies who had husbands. But not all the relief that could\r\ncome from man, not all the bounties that the prince could bestow, nor\r\nall the atonements which could be presented to the gods availed to\r\nrelieve Nero from the infamy of being believed to have ordered the\r\nconflagration. Hence, to suppress the rumor, he falsely charged with the\r\nguilt and punished with the most exquisite tortures the persons commonly\r\ncalled Christians, who were hated for their enormities.\r\n\r\nChristus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by\r\nPontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the\r\npernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only\r\nthrough Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of\r\nRome also, whither all things horrible and disgraceful flow from all\r\nquarters as to a common receptacle and where they are encouraged.\r\nAccordingly first those were seized who confessed they were Christians;\r\nnext on their information a vast multitude were convicted, not so much\r\non the charge of burning the city as of hating the human race. And in\r\ntheir deaths they were also made the subjects of sport, for they were\r\ncovered with the hides of wild beasts, and worried to death by dogs, or\r\nnailed to crosses, or set fire to, and when day declined, burned to\r\nserve for nocturnal lights. Nero offered his own gardens for that\r\nspectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling\r\nwith the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else standing in\r\nhis chariot. Whence a feeling of compassion arose toward the sufferers,\r\nthough guilty and deserving to be made examples of by capital\r\npunishment, because they seemed not to be cut off for the public good,\r\nbut victims to the ferocity of one man.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, in order to supply money all Italy was pillaged, the\r\nprovinces ruined, both the people in alliance with us and the states\r\nwhich are called free. Even the gods were not exempt from plunder on\r\nthis occasion, their temples in the city being despoiled, and all the\r\ngold conveyed away which the Roman people, in every age, either in\r\ngratitude for triumphs or in fulfilment of vows, had consecrated, in\r\ntimes of prosperity, or in seasons of dismay. Through Greece and Asia,\r\nindeed, the gifts and oblations and even the statues of the deities were\r\ncarried off.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] According to Suetonius, Nero turned the public calamity to his own\r\nprivate advantage. He promised to remove the bodies that lay amid the\r\nruins, and to clear the ground at his own expense. By that artifice he\r\nsecured all the remaining property of the unhappy sufferers for his own\r\nuse. To add to his ill-gotten store, he levied contributions in the\r\nprovinces, and by those means collected an immense sum.\r\n\r\n[28] By a law of the Twelve Tables, it was provided that a space of\r\nsomething more than two feet was to be left between all new-built\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION OF THE CHRISTIANS UNDER NERO\r\n\r\nA.D. 64-68\r\n\r\nFREDERIC WILLIAM FARRAR\r\n\r\n     Down to the reign of Nero Christians in the Roman Empire were\r\n     regarded by the ruling powers merely as a Jewish sect, harmless and\r\n     guilty of nothing which could call for the interference of the\r\n     State with their ways of life or of worship. They were therefore\r\n     unmolested. But during the reign of the infamous Emperor in whom\r\n     they saw antichrist and the actual embodiment of the symbolic\r\n     monstrosities of the Apocalypse, the Christians began to be\r\n     recognized as a separate people, and from milder persecutions at\r\n     first, under cover of legal procedure, they were soon subjected to\r\n     outrages, tortures, and deaths than which history has none more\r\n     revolting and pitiful to record. In Kaulbach's great painting of\r\n     Nero's persecution there is enough of portrayal and suggestion to\r\n     add a terrible vividness to the ordinary historian's word-pictures.\r\n     The Emperor, surrounded by his boon companions, stands on his\r\n     garden terrace to receive divine honors, while a group of suffering\r\n     Christians--among them St. Peter, crucified head down, and St.\r\n     Paul, passionately protesting against the diabolical work--move to\r\n     compassion a company of elderly men and a body of German soldiers\r\n     who look upon the horrible spectacle of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n     This, the first persecution of the Christians, reached its\r\n     culminating point of ferocity in A.D. 64, after Nero had been\r\n     accused of kindling, or conniving at the work of those who did\r\n     kindle, the great fire in Rome. In order to divert attention, even\r\n     if he could not turn suspicion, from himself, having charged the\r\n     Christians with causing the conflagration, he ordered the\r\n     atrocities which added a still darker stain to his personal and\r\n     imperial record of shameless crime and savage inhumanity. First\r\n     such as confessed themselves to be Christians were dealt with, and\r\n     from these information was extorted on which vast numbers were\r\n     convicted, \"not so much on the charge of burning the city as of\r\n     hating the human race.\"\r\n\r\n     Nero's character and acts have been depicted by many writers and in\r\n     famous works of art, but not even the pencil of Kaulbach can make\r\n     more keen the realization of those scenes enacted in this\r\n     persecution than the thrilling narration of Farrar, which for\r\n     picturesque eloquence, fired with dramatic intensity, has seldom\r\n     been surpassed in English literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNero was so secure in his absolutism, he had hitherto found it so\r\nimpossible to shock the feelings of the people or to exhaust the\r\nterrified adulation of the senate, that he was usually indifferent to\r\nthe pasquinades which were constantly holding up his name to execration\r\nand contempt. But now[29] he felt that he had gone too far, and that his\r\npower would be seriously imperilled if he did not succeed in diverting\r\nthe suspicions of the populace. He was perfectly aware that when the\r\npeople in the streets cursed those who set fire to the city they meant\r\nto curse _him_. If he did not take some immediate step, he felt that he\r\nmight perish, as Gaius had perished before him, by the dagger of the\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point of his career that Nero becomes a prominent figure\r\nin the history of the Church. It was this phase of cruelty which seemed\r\nto throw a blood-red light over his whole character and led men to look\r\non him as the very incarnation of the world-power in its most demoniac\r\naspect, as worse than the Antiochus Epiphanes of Daniel's Apocalypse, as\r\nthe Man of Sin whom--in language figurative indeed, yet awfully\r\ntrue--the Lord should slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy with\r\nthe brightness of his coming, for Nero endeavored to fix the odious\r\ncrime of having destroyed the capital of the world upon the most\r\ninnocent and faithful of his subjects--upon the only subjects who\r\noffered heartfelt prayers on his behalf--the Roman Christians. They were\r\nthe defenceless victims of this horrible charge, for though they were\r\nthe most harmless, they were also the most hated and the most slandered\r\nof living men.\r\n\r\nWhy he should have thought of singling out the Christians has always\r\nbeen a curious problem, for at this point St. Luke ends the Acts of the\r\nApostles, perhaps purposely dropping the curtain, because it would have\r\nbeen perilous and useless to narrate the horrors in which the hitherto\r\nneutral or friendly Roman government began to play so disgraceful a\r\npart. Neither Tacitus, nor Suetonius, nor the Apocalypse, helps us to\r\nsolve this particular problem. The Christians had filled no large space\r\nin the eye of the world. Until the days of Domitian we do not hear of a\r\nsingle noble or distinguished person who had joined their ranks. That\r\nthe Pudens and Claudia of Rom. xvi. were the Pudens and Claudia of\r\nMartial's _Epigrams_ seems to me to be a baseless dream. If the \"foreign\r\nsuperstition\" with which Pomponia Græcina, wife of Aulus Plautius, the\r\nconqueror of Britain, was charged, and of which she was acquitted, was\r\nindeed, as has been suspected, the Christian religion, at any rate the\r\nname of Christianity was not alluded to by the ancient writers who had\r\nmentioned the circumstance. Even if Rom. xvi. was addressed to Rome, and\r\nnot, as I believe, to Ephesus, \"they of the household of Narcissus which\r\nwere in the Lord\" were unknown slaves, as also were \"they of Cæsar's\r\nhousehold.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaves and artisans, Jewish and Gentile, who formed the Christian\r\ncommunity at Rome, had never in any way come into collision with the\r\nRoman government. They must have been the victims rather than the\r\nexciters of the messianic tumults--for such they are conjectured to have\r\nbeen--which led to the expulsion of the Jews from Rome by the futile\r\nedict of Claudius. Nay, so obedient and docile were they required to be\r\nby the very principles on which their morality was based, so far were\r\nthey removed from the fierce independence of the Jewish zealots, that,\r\nin writing to them a few years earlier, the greatest of their leaders\r\nhad urged upon them a payment of tribute and a submission to the higher\r\npowers, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake, because the\r\nearthly ruler, in his office of repressing evil works, is a minister of\r\nGod. That the Christians were entirely innocent of the crime charged\r\nagainst them was well known both at the time and afterward. But how was\r\nit that Nero sought popularity and partly averted the deep rage which\r\nwas rankling in many hearts against himself, by torturing men and women,\r\non whose agonies he thought that the populace would gaze not only with a\r\nstolid indifference, but even with fierce satisfaction?\r\n\r\nGibbon has conjectured that the Christians were confounded with the\r\nJews, and that the detestation universally felt for the latter fell with\r\ndouble force upon the former. Christians suffered even more than the\r\nJews because of the calumnies so assiduously circulated against them,\r\nand from what appeared to the ancients to be the revolting absurdity of\r\ntheir peculiar tenets. \"Nero,\" says Tacitus, \"exposed to accusation, and\r\ntortured with the most exquisite penalties, a set of men detested for\r\ntheir enormities, whom the common people called 'Christians.' Christus,\r\nthe founder of this sect, was executed during the reign of Tiberius, by\r\nthe procurator Pontius Pilate, and the deadly superstition, suppressed\r\nfor a time, began to burst out once more, not only throughout Judea,\r\nwhere the evil had its root, but even in the city, whither from every\r\nquarter all things horrible or shameful are drifted, and find their\r\nvotaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe lordly disdain which prevented Tacitus from making any inquiry into\r\nthe real views and character of the Christians is shown by the fact that\r\nhe catches up the most baseless allegations against them. He talks of\r\ntheir doctrines as savage and shameful when they breathed the very\r\nspirit of peace and purity. He charges them with being animated by a\r\nhatred of their kind when their central tenet was a universal charity.\r\nThe masses, he says, called them \"Christians\"; and while he almost\r\napologizes for staining his page with so vulgar an appellation,[30] he\r\nmerely mentions in passing that, though innocent of the charge of being\r\nturbulent incendiaries, on which they were tortured to death, they were\r\nyet a set of guilty and infamous sectaries, to be classed with the\r\nlowest dregs of Roman criminals.\r\n\r\nBut the haughty historian throws no light on one difficulty--namely, the\r\ncircumstances which led to the _Christians_ being thus singled out. The\r\nJews were in no way involved in Nero's persecution. To persecute the\r\nJews at Rome would not have been an easy matter. They were sufficiently\r\nnumerous to be formidable, and had overawed Cicero in the zenith of his\r\nfame. Besides this, the Jewish religion was recognized, tolerated,\r\nlicensed. Throughout the length and breadth of the empire no man,\r\nhowever much he and his race might be detested and despised, could have\r\nbeen burned or tortured for the mere fact of being a Jew. We hear of no\r\nJewish martyrdoms or Jewish persecutions till we come to the times of\r\nthe Jewish War, and then chiefly in Palestine itself. It is clear that a\r\nshedding of blood--in fact, some form or other of human sacrifice--was\r\nimperatively demanded by popular feeling as an expiation of the ruinous\r\ncrime which had plunged so many thousands into the depths of misery. In\r\nvain had the sibylline books been once more consulted, and in vain had\r\npublic prayer been offered, in accordance with their directions to\r\nVulcan and the goddesses of Earth and Hades. In vain had the Roman\r\nmatrons walked in procession in dark robes, and with their long hair\r\nunbound, to propitiate the insulted majesty of Juno, and to sprinkle\r\nwith sea-water her ancient statue. In vain had largesses been lavished\r\nupon the people, and propitiatory sacrifices offered to the gods. In\r\nvain had public banquets been celebrated in honor of various deities. A\r\ncrime had been committed, and Romans had perished unavenged. Blood cried\r\nfor blood before the sullen suspicion against Nero could be averted or\r\nthe indignation of heaven appeased.\r\n\r\nNero had always hated, persecuted, and exiled the philosophers, and no\r\ndoubt, so far as he knew anything of the Christians--so far as he saw\r\namong his own countless slaves any who had embraced this superstition,\r\nwhich the _élite_ of Rome described as not only new, but \"execrable\" and\r\n\"malefic\"--he would hate their gravity and purity, and feel for them\r\nthat raging envy which is the tribute that virtue receives from vice.\r\nMoreover, St. Paul, in all probability, had recently stood before his\r\ntribunal, and though he had been acquitted on the special charges of\r\nturbulence and profanation, respecting which he had appealed to Cæsar,\r\nyet during the judicial inquiry Nero could hardly have failed to hear\r\nfrom the emissaries of the Sanhedrim many fierce slanders of a sect\r\nwhich was everywhere spoken against. The Jews were by far the deadliest\r\nenemies of the Christians, and two persons of Jewish proclivities were\r\nat this time in close proximity to the person of the Emperor. One was\r\nthe pantomimist Aliturus, the other was Poppæa, the harlot-empress.[31]\r\nThe Jews were in communication with these powerful favorites, and had\r\neven promised Nero that if his enemies ever prevailed at Rome he should\r\nhave the kingdom of Jerusalem.[32]\r\n\r\nIt is not even impossible that there may have been a third dark and evil\r\ninfluence at work to undermine the Christians, for about this very time\r\nthe unscrupulous Pharisee Flavius Josephus had availed himself of the\r\nintrigues of the palace to secure the liberation of some Jewish priests.\r\nIf, as seems certain, the Jews had it in their power during the reign of\r\nNero more or less to shape the whisper of the throne, does not\r\nhistorical induction drive us to conclude with some confidence that the\r\nsuggestion of the Christians as scapegoats and victims came from them?\r\nSt. Clement says in his Epistle that the Christians suffered _through\r\njealousy_. _Whose_ jealousy? Who can tell what dark secrets lie veiled\r\nunder that suggestive word? Was Acte a Christian, and was Poppæa jealous\r\nof her? That suggestion seems at once inadequate and improbable,\r\nespecially as Acte was not hurt. But there _was_ a deadly jealousy at\r\nwork against the new religion.\r\n\r\nTo the pagans, Christianity was but a religious\r\nextravagance--contemptible, indeed, but otherwise insignificant. To the\r\nJews, on the other hand, it was an object of hatred, which never stopped\r\nshort of bloodshed when it possessed or could usurp the power, and\r\nwhich, though long suppressed by circumstances, displayed itself in all\r\nthe intensity of its virulence during the brief spasm of the\r\ndictatorship of Barcochebas. Christianity was hateful to the Jews on\r\n_every_ ground. It nullified their law. It liberated all Gentiles from\r\nthe heavy yoke of that law, without thereby putting them on a lower\r\nlevel. It even tended to render those who were born Jews indifferent to\r\nthe institutions of Mosaism. It was, as it were, a fatal revolt and\r\nschism from within, more dangerous than any assault from without. And,\r\nworse than all, it was by the Gentiles confounded with the Judaism which\r\nwas its bitterest antagonist. While it sheltered its existence under the\r\nmantle of Judaism, as a _religio licita_, it drew down upon the religion\r\nfrom whose bosom it sprang all the scorn and hatred which were attached\r\nby the world to its own special tenets, for however much the Greeks and\r\nRomans despised the Jews, they despised still more the belief that the\r\nLord and Saviour of the world was a crucified malefactor who had risen\r\nfrom the dead.\r\n\r\nI see in the proselytism of Poppæa, guided by Jewish malice, the only\r\nadequate explanation of the first Christian persecution. Hers was the\r\njealousy which had goaded Nero to matricide; hers not improbably was the\r\ninstigated fanaticism of a proselyte which urged him to imbrue his hands\r\nin martyr blood. And she had her reward. A woman of whom Tacitus has not\r\na word of good to say and who seems to have been repulsive even to a\r\nSuetonius, is handed down by the renegade Pharisee as \"a devout\r\nwoman\"--as a worshipper of God!\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, when once the Christians were pointed out to the popular\r\nvengeance, many reasons would be adduced to prove their connection with\r\nthe conflagration. Temples had perished--and were they not notorious\r\nenemies of the temples? Did not popular rumor charge them with nocturnal\r\norgies and Thyestæan feasts? Suspicions of incendiarism were sometimes\r\nbrought against Jews; but the Jews were not in the habit of talking, as\r\nthese sectaries were, about a fire which should consume the world, and\r\nrejoicing in the prospect of that fiery consummation.[33] Nay, more,\r\nwhen pagans had bewailed the destruction of the city and the loss of\r\nthe ancient monuments of Rome, had not these pernicious people used\r\nambiguous language, as though they joyously recognized in these events\r\nthe signs of a coming end? Even when they tried to suppress all outward\r\ntokens of exultation, had they not listened to the fears and\r\nlamentations of their fellow-citizens with some sparkle in the eyes, and\r\nhad they not answered with something of triumph in their tones? There\r\nwas a satanic plausibility which dictated the selection of these\r\nparticular victims. Because they hated the wickedness of the world, with\r\nits ruthless games and hideous idolatries, they were accused of hatred\r\nof the whole human race.\r\n\r\nThe charge of _incivisme_, so fatal in this reign of terror, was\r\nsufficient to ruin a body of men who scorned the sacrifices of\r\nheathendom and turned away with abhorrence from its banquets and\r\ngayeties. The cultivated classes looked down upon the Christians with a\r\ndisdain which would hardly even mention them without an apology. The\r\n_canaille_ of pagan cities insulted them with obscene inscriptions and\r\nblasphemous pictures on the very walls of the places where they met.[34]\r\nNay, they were popularly known by nicknames, like _Sarmenticii_ and\r\n_Semaxii_--untranslatable terms of opprobrium derived from the fagots\r\nwith which they were burned and the stakes to which they were chained.\r\nEven the heroic courage which they displayed was described as being\r\nsheer obstinacy and stupid fanaticism.\r\n\r\nBut in the method chosen for the punishment of these saintly innocents\r\nNero gave one more proof of the close connection between effeminate\r\næstheticism and sanguinary callousness. As in old days, \"on that\r\nopprobrious hill,\" the temple of Chemosh had stood close by that of\r\nMoloch, so now we find the _spoliarium_ beside the _fornices_--Lust hard\r\nby Hate. The _carnificina_ of Tiberius, at Capreæ, adjoined the\r\n_sellariæ_. History has given many proofs that no man is more\r\nsystematically heartless than a corrupted debauchee. Like people, like\r\nprince. In the then condition of Rome, Nero well knew that a nation,\r\n\"cruel, by their sports to blood inured,\" would be most likely to forget\r\ntheir miseries and condone their suspicions by mixing games and gayety\r\nwith spectacles of refined and atrocious cruelty, of which, for eighteen\r\ncenturies, the most passing record has sufficed to make men's blood run\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nTacitus tells us that \"those who confessed were first seized, and then\r\non their evidence _a huge multitude_[35] were convicted, not so much on\r\nthe charge of incendiarism as for their hatred to mankind.\" Compressed\r\nand obscure as the sentence is, Tacitus clearly means to imply by the\r\n\"confession\" to which he alludes the confession of Christianity, and\r\nthough he is not sufficiently generous to acquit the Christians\r\nabsolutely of all complicity in the great crime, he distinctly says that\r\nthey were made the scapegoats of a general indignation. The phrase--\"a\r\nhuge multitude\"--is one of the few existing indications of the number of\r\nmartyrs in the first persecution, and of the number of Christians in the\r\nRoman Church. When the historian says that they were convicted on the\r\ncharge of \"hatred against mankind\" he shows how completely he confounds\r\nthem with the Jews, against whom he elsewhere brings the accusation of\r\n\"hostile feelings toward all except themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThen the historian adds one casual but frightful sentence--a sentence\r\nwhich flings a dreadful light on the cruelty of Nero and the Roman mob.\r\nHe adds: \"And various forms of mockery were added to enhance their dying\r\nagonies. Covered with the skins of wild beasts, they were doomed to die\r\nby the mangling of dogs, or by being nailed to crosses, or to be set on\r\nfire and burned after twilight by way of nightly illumination. Nero\r\noffered his own garden for this show, and gave a chariot race, mingling\r\nwith the mob in the dress of a charioteer, or actually driving about\r\namong them. Hence, guilty as the victims were, and deserving of the\r\nworst punishments, a feeling of compassion toward them began to rise, as\r\nmen felt that they were being immolated not for any advantage to the\r\nCommonwealth, but to glut the savagery of a single man.\"\r\n\r\nImagine that awful scene, once witnessed by the silent obelisk in the\r\nsquare before St. Peter's at Rome! Imagine it, that we may realize how\r\nvast is the change which Christianity has wrought in the feelings of\r\nmankind! There, where the vast dome now rises, were once the gardens of\r\nNero. They were thronged with gay crowds, among whom the Emperor moved\r\nin his frivolous degradation--and on every side were men dying slowly on\r\ntheir cross of shame. Along the paths of those gardens on the autumn\r\nnights were ghastly torches, blackening the ground beneath them with\r\nstreams of sulphurous pitch, and each of those living torches was a\r\nmartyr in his shirt of fire. And in the amphitheatre hard by, in sight\r\nof twenty thousand spectators, famished dogs were tearing to pieces some\r\nof the best and purest of men and women, hideously disguised in the\r\nskins of bears or wolves. Thus did Nero baptize in the blood of martyrs\r\nthe city which was to be for ages the capital of the world!\r\n\r\nThe specific atrocity of such spectacles--unknown to the earlier ages\r\nwhich they called barbarous--was due to the cold-blooded selfishness,\r\nthe hideous realism of a refined, delicate, æsthetic age. To please\r\nthese \"lisping hawthorn buds,\" these debauched and sanguinary dandies,\r\nart, forsooth, must know nothing of morality; must accept and rejoice in\r\na \"healthy animalism\"; must estimate life by the number of its few\r\nwildest pulsations; must reckon that life is worthless without the most\r\nthrilling experiences of horror or delight! Comedy must be actual shame,\r\nand tragedy genuine bloodshed. When the play of Afranius, called _The\r\nConflagration_, was put on the stage, a house must be really burned and\r\nits furniture really plundered. In the mime called _Laureolus_ an actor\r\nmust really be crucified and mangled by a bear, and really fling himself\r\ndown and deluge the stage with blood. When the heroism of Mucius Scævola\r\nwas represented, a real criminal must thrust his hand without a groan\r\ninto the flame and stand motionless while it is being burned. Prometheus\r\nmust be really chained to his rock, and Dirce in very fact be tossed and\r\ngored by the wild bull; and Orpheus be torn to pieces by a real bear;\r\nand Icarus must really fly, even though he fall and be dashed to death;\r\nand Hercules must ascend the funeral pyre and there be veritably burned\r\nalive; and slaves and criminals must play their parts heroically in gold\r\nand purple till the flames envelop them.\r\n\r\nIt was the ultimate romance of a degraded and brutalized society. The\r\nRoman people, \"victors once, now vile and base,\" could now only be\r\namused by sanguinary melodrama. Fables must be made realities, and the\r\ncriminal must gracefully transform his supreme agonies into amusements\r\nfor the multitude by becoming a gladiator or a tragedian. Such were the\r\nspectacles at which Nero loved to gaze through his emerald eye-glass.\r\nAnd worse things than these--things indescribable, unutterable. Infamous\r\nmythologies were enacted, in which women must play their part in\r\ntorments of shamefulness more intolerable than death. A St. Peter must\r\nhang upon the cross in the Pincian gardens, as a real Laureolus upon the\r\nstage. A Christian boy must be the Icarus, and a Christian man the\r\nScævola or the Hercules or the Orpheus of the amphitheatre; and\r\nChristian women, modest maidens, holy matrons, must be the Danaids or\r\nthe Proserpine or worse, and play their parts as priestesses of Saturn\r\nand Ceres, and in blood-stained dramas of the dead. No wonder that Nero\r\nbecame to Christian imagination the very incarnation of evil; the\r\nantichrist; the Wild Beast from the abyss; the delegate of the great red\r\nDragon, with a diadem and a name of blasphemy upon his brow. No wonder\r\nthat he left a furrow of horror in the hearts of men, and that, ten\r\ncenturies after his death, the church of Sta. Maria del Popolo had to be\r\nbuilt by Pope Pascal II to exorcise from Christian Rome his restless and\r\nmiserable ghost!\r\n\r\nAnd it struck them with deeper horror to see that the antichrist, so far\r\nfrom being abhorred, was generally popular. He was popular because he\r\npresented to the degraded populace their own image and similitude. The\r\nfrog-like unclean spirits which proceeded, as it were, out of his mouth\r\nwere potent with these dwellers in an atmosphere of pestilence. They had\r\nlost all love for freedom and nobleness; they cared only for doles and\r\nexcitement. Even when the infamies of a Petronius had been superseded by\r\nthe murderous orgies of Tigellinus, Nero was still everywhere welcomed\r\nwith shouts as a god on earth and saluted on all coins as Apollo, as\r\nHercules, as \"the savior of the world.\" The poets still assured him\r\nthat there was no deity in heaven who would not think it an honor to\r\nconcede to him his prerogatives; that if he did not place himself well\r\nin the centre of Olympus, the equilibrium of the universe would be\r\ndestroyed. Victims were slain along his path, and altars raised for\r\nhim--for this wretch, whom an honest slave could not but despise and\r\nloathe--as though he was too great for mere human honors. Nay, more, he\r\nfound adorers and imitators of his execrable example--an Otho, a\r\nVitellius, a Domitian, a Commodus, a Caracalla, a Heliogabalus--to\r\npoison the air of the world. The lusts and hungers and furies of the\r\nworld lamented him, and cherished his memory, and longed for his return.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though all bad men--who were the majority--admired and even\r\nloved him, he died the death of a dog. Tremendous as was the power of\r\nimperialism, the Romans often treated their individual emperors as Nero\r\nhimself treated the Syrian goddess, whose image he first worshipped with\r\nawful veneration and then subjected to the most grotesque indignities,\r\nfor retribution did not linger, and the vengeance fell at once on the\r\nguilty Emperor and the guilty city.\r\n\r\n    \"Careless _seems_ the Great Avenger: History's pages but record\r\n    One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt false systems and the Word;\r\n    Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne,\r\n    Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown\r\n    Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe air was full of prodigies. There were terrible storms; the plague\r\nwrought fearful ravages. Rumors spread from lip to lip. Men spoke of\r\nmonstrous births; of deaths by lightning under strange circumstances; of\r\na brazen statue of Nero melted by the flash; of places struck by the\r\nbrand of heaven in fourteen regions of the city; of sudden darkenings of\r\nthe sun. A hurricane devastated Campania; comets blazed in the heavens;\r\nearthquakes shook the ground. On all sides were the traces of deep\r\nuneasiness and superstitious terror. To all these portents, which were\r\naccepted as true by Christians as well as by pagans, the Christians\r\nwould give a specially terrible significance. They strengthened their\r\nconviction that the coming of the Lord drew nigh. They convinced the\r\nbetter sort of pagans that the hour of their deliverance from a tyranny\r\nso monstrous and so disgraceful was near at hand.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the shocking servility with which alike the senate and the\r\npeople had welcomed him back to the city with shouts of triumph, Nero\r\nfelt that the air of Rome was heavy with curses against his name. He\r\nwithdrew to Naples, and was at supper there on March 19, A.D. 68, the\r\nanniversary of his mother's murder, when he heard that the first note of\r\nrevolt had been sounded by the brave C. Julius Vindex, prefect of\r\nFarther Gaul. He was so far from being disturbed by the news that he\r\nshowed a secret joy at the thought that he could now order Gaul to be\r\nplundered. For eight days he took no notice of the matter. He was only\r\nroused to send an address to the senate because Vindex wounded his\r\nvanity by calling him _Ahenobarbus_[37] and \"a bad singer.\" But when\r\nmessenger after messenger came from the provinces with tidings of\r\nmenace, he hurried back to Rome. At last, when he heard that Virginius\r\nRufus had also rebelled in Germany, and Galba in Spain, he became aware\r\nof the desperate nature of his position.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this intelligence he fainted away, and remained for some\r\ntime unconscious. He continued, indeed, his grossness and frivolity, but\r\nthe wildest and fiercest schemes chased each other through his\r\nmelodramatic brain. He would slay all the exiles; he would give up all\r\nthe provinces to plunder; he would order all the Gauls in the city to be\r\nbutchered; he would have all the senators invited to banquets, and would\r\nthen poison them; he would have the city set on fire, and the wild\r\nbeasts of the Amphitheatre let loose among the people; he would depose\r\nboth the consuls and become sole consul himself, since legend said that\r\nonly by a consul could Gauls be conquered; he would go with an army to\r\nthe province, and when he got there would do nothing but weep, and when\r\nhe had thus moved the rebels to compassion would next day sing with them\r\nat a great festival the ode of victory which he must at once compose.\r\nNot a single manly resolution lent a moment's dignity to his miserable\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nSometimes he talked of escaping to Ostia and arming the sailors; at\r\nothers of escaping to Alexandria and earning his bread by his \"divine\r\nvoice.\" Meanwhile he was hourly subjected to the deadliest insults, and\r\nterrified by dreams and omens so sombre that his faith in the\r\nastrologers who had promised him the government of the East and the\r\nkingdom of Jerusalem began to be rudely shaken. When he heard that not a\r\nsingle army or general remained faithful to him, he kicked over the\r\ntable at which he was dining, dashed to pieces on the ground two\r\nfavorite goblets embossed with scenes from the Homeric poems, and placed\r\nin a golden box some poison furnished to him by Locusta.\r\n\r\nThe last effort which he contemplated was to mount the Rostra, beg\r\npardon of the people for his crimes, ask them to try him again, and, at\r\nthe worst, to allow him the prefecture of Egypt. But this design he did\r\nnot dare to carry out, from fear that he would be torn to pieces before\r\nhe reached the Forum. Meanwhile he found that the palace had been\r\ndeserted by his guards, and that his attendants had robbed his chamber\r\neven of the golden box in which he had stored his poison. Rushing out,\r\nas though to drown himself in the Tiber, he changed his mind, and begged\r\nfor some quiet hiding-place in which to collect his thoughts. The\r\nfreedman Phaon offered him a lowly villa about four miles from the city.\r\nBarefooted, and with a faded coat thrown over his tunic, he hid his head\r\nand face in a kerchief and rode away with only four attendants. On the\r\nroad he heard the tumult of the prætorians cursing his name. Amid evil\r\nomens and serious perils he reached the back of Phaon's villa, and,\r\ncreeping toward it through a muddy reed-bed, was secretly admitted into\r\none of its mean slave-chambers by an aperture through which he had to\r\ncrawl on his hands and feet.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to dwell on the miserable spectacle of his end, perhaps\r\nthe meanest and most pusillanimous which has ever been recorded. The\r\npoor wretch who, without a pang, had caused so many brave Romans and so\r\nmany innocent Christians to be murdered could not summon up resolution\r\nto die. He devised every operatic incident of which he could think. When\r\neven his most degraded slaves urged him to have sufficient manliness to\r\nsave himself from the fearful infamies which otherwise awaited him, he\r\nordered his grave to be dug, and fragments of marble to be collected for\r\nits adornment, and water and wood for his funeral pyre, perpetually\r\nwhining, \"What an artist to perish!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a courier arrived for Phaon. Nero snatched his despatches out\r\nof his hand and read that the senate had decided that he should be\r\npunished in the ancestral fashion as a public enemy. Asking what the\r\nancestral fashion was, he was informed that he would be stripped naked\r\nand scourged to death with rods, with his head thrust into a fork.\r\nHorrified at this, he seized two daggers, and, after theatrically trying\r\ntheir edges, sheathed them again, with the excuse that the fatal moment\r\nhad not yet arrived! Then he bade Sporus begin to sing his funeral song,\r\nand begged some one to show him how to die. Even his own intense shame\r\nat his cowardice was an insufficient stimulus, and he whiled away the\r\ntime in vapid epigrams and pompous quotations. The sound of horses'\r\nhoofs then broke on his ears, and, venting one more Greek quotation, he\r\nheld the dagger to his throat. It was driven home by Epaphroditus, one\r\nof his literary slaves. At this moment the centurion who came to arrest\r\nhim rushed in. Nero was not yet dead, and under pretence of helping him\r\nthe centurion began to stanch the wound with his cloak. \"Too late,\" he\r\nsaid; \"is this your fidelity?\" So he died; and the bystanders were\r\nhorrified with the way in which his eyes seemed to be starting out of\r\nhis head in a rigid stare. He had begged that his body might be burned\r\nwithout posthumous insults, and this was conceded by Icelus, the\r\nfreedman of Galbo.\r\n\r\nSo died the last of the Cæsars! And as Robespierre was lamented by his\r\nlandlady, so even Nero was tenderly buried by two nurses who had known\r\nhim in the exquisite beauty of his engaging childhood, and by Acte, who\r\nhad inspired his youth with a genuine love.\r\n\r\nBut his history does not end with his grave. He was to live on in the\r\nexpectation alike of Jews and Christians. The fifth head of the Wild\r\nBeast of the Revelation was in some sort to reappear as the eighth; the\r\nhead with its diadem and its names of blasphemy had been wounded to\r\ndeath, but in the Apocalyptic sense the deadly wound was to be healed.\r\nThe Roman world could not believe that the heir of the deified Julian\r\nrace could be cut off thus suddenly and obscurely and vanish like foam\r\nupon the water. The Christians felt sure that it required something more\r\nthan an ordinary death stroke to destroy the antichrist, and to end the\r\nvitality of the Wild Beast from the Abyss, who had been the first to set\r\nhimself in deadly antagonism against the Redeemer and to wage war upon\r\nthe saints of God.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] In his behavior at the burning of Rome.\r\n\r\n[30] There can be little doubt that the name \"Christian\"--so curiously\r\nhybrid, yet so richly expressive--was a nickname due to the wit of the\r\nAntiochenes, which exercised itself quite fearlessly even on the Roman\r\nemperors. They were not afraid to affix nicknames to Caracalla, and to\r\ncall Julian Cecrops and Victimarius, with keen satire of his beard. It\r\nis clear that the sacred writers avoided the name, because it was\r\nemployed by their enemies, and by them mingled with terms of the vilest\r\nopprobrium. It only became familiar when the virtues of Christians had\r\nshed lustre upon it, and when alike in its true form, and in the\r\nignorant mispronunciation \"Chrestians,\" it readily lent itself to\r\nvaluable allegorical meanings.\r\n\r\n[31] According to John of Antioch and the _Chronicon Paschale_, Nero was\r\noriginally favorable to the Christians, and put Pilate to death, for\r\nwhich the Jews plotted his murder. Poppæa's Judaism is inferred from her\r\nrefusing to be burned, and requesting to be embalmed; from her adopting\r\nthe custom of wearing a veil in the streets; from the favor which she\r\nshowed to Aliturus and Josephus; and from the fact that Josephus speaks\r\nof her as a religious woman.\r\n\r\n[32] Tiberius Alexander, the nephew of Philo, afterward procurator of\r\nJudea, was a person of influence at Rome; but he was a renegade, and\r\nwould not be likely to hate the Christians. It is, however, remarkable\r\nthat legend attributed the anger of Nero to the conversion of his\r\nmistress and a favorite slave.\r\n\r\n[33] St. Peter--apparently thinking of the fire at Rome and its\r\nconsequences--calls the persecution from which the Christians were\r\nsuffering when he wrote his First Epistle a \"conflagration.\"\r\n\r\n[34] Tertullian mentions one of these coarse caricatures--a figure with\r\none foot hoofed, wearing a toga, carrying a book, and with long ass's\r\nears, under which was written, \"The God of the Christians, Onokoites.\"\r\nHe says that Christians were actually charged with worshipping the head\r\nof an ass. The same preposterous calumny, with many others, is alluded\r\nto by Minucius Felix. The Christians were hence called _Asinarii_.\r\nAnalogous calumnies were aimed at the Jews.\r\n\r\n[35] Tertullian says that \"Nero was the first who raged with the sword\r\nof Cæsar against this sect, which was then specially rising at Rome.\"\r\n\r\n[36] James Russell Lowell: _The Present Crisis_.\r\n\r\n[37] \"Bronze-beard.\" Ahenobarbus was the name of a plebeian family to\r\nwhich Nero belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT JEWISH REVOLT\r\n\r\nSIEGE AND DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM\r\n\r\nA.D. 70\r\n\r\nJOSEPHUS\r\n\r\n     From A.D. 66 events of great moment occurred in Palestine. The Jews\r\n     were in the throes of revolt against the Roman Government. At the\r\n     same time the chief factions of the revolutionary party were\r\n     constantly fighting each other. One of these factions was led by\r\n     the famous John of Gischala, another by Simon bar Gioras, and a\r\n     third by Eleazar. These factions of a party which--since the\r\n     reduction of Judea to a Roman province soon after the death of\r\n     Herod--had resisted the oppression of the procurators, were now\r\n     stirred to revolt by the exactions of the procurator Gessius\r\n     Florus. The revolutionary party, called the Zealots, gained power,\r\n     and there were many outbreaks in Jerusalem. The counsel of the more\r\n     prudent spirits was disregarded. At last Roman blood was shed. The\r\n     nobility and priesthood played into the hands of the Zealots by\r\n     applying to Florus to put down the revolt. Florus marched against\r\n     Jerusalem and was badly beaten by the Zealots.\r\n\r\n     Open war henceforth existed. Josephus, a Jew of the lineage of\r\n     Aaron, trained according to the best discipline of his race, and\r\n     who had also been well received at Rome, was placed by his\r\n     countrymen in command of the province of Galilee. Afterward, as a\r\n     historian, he described the events of the war.\r\n\r\n     Vespasian, who was then Rome's greatest general, soon came at the\r\n     head of sixty thousand Roman soldiers. He attacked Galilee.\r\n     Josephus, with such followers as he could gather, took position on\r\n     an almost inaccessible hill in Jotapata, which the Romans for five\r\n     days stormed in vain, then besieged its brave defenders, afterward\r\n     repeatedly assaulted; and finally, during the night following the\r\n     forty-seventh day of the siege, Titus, serving under his father,\r\n     Vespasian, gained possession of the place. Josephus, with forty of\r\n     the principal citizens, hid in a cave, but their refuge was\r\n     discovered through treachery.\r\n\r\n     Vespasian was anxious to take Josephus alive. He sent the tribune\r\n     Nicanor, who had been his friend, to the Jewish leader to induce\r\n     him with fair promises to surrender. Josephus was about to give\r\n     himself up, but was prevented by his companions. \"We will care for\r\n     the honor of our country,\" they said. At the same time they offered\r\n     a sword and \"a hand that shall use it against thee.\" Josephus then\r\n     proposed that they should all die together, but by the hands of\r\n     one another, instead of suicide. Lots were cast. He who drew the\r\n     first offered his neck to him who stood next and so forward.\r\n     Finally, through marvellous fortune, Josephus and one other alone\r\n     were left, and here the slaughter ended. The two survivors\r\n     surrendered to the Romans. Loud cries for the death of Josephus\r\n     arose, but he was spared by the intercession of Titus. The fall of\r\n     Jotapata led to the subjugation of Galilee.\r\n\r\n     When captured, Josephus made to Vespasian the prophecy: \"Thou shalt\r\n     be emperor--thou and thy son after thee,\" a prediction soon to be\r\n     fulfilled, for in A.D. 69 Vespasian was proclaimed emperor, and the\r\n     next year went to Rome, leaving Titus to carry on the war and\r\n     subdue Jerusalem. Vespasian himself, it is recorded, released\r\n     Josephus, \"cutting off his chains,\" thus relieving him from all\r\n     stain of dishonor.\r\n\r\n     \"The capture of Jerusalem by Titus in this campaign,\" says Hosmer,\r\n     \"is one of the most memorable events in the history of mankind. It\r\n     caused the expulsion of an entire race from its home. The Roman\r\n     valor, skill, and persistence were never more conspicuously\r\n     displayed. No more desperate resistance was ever opposed to the\r\n     eagle-emblemed mistress of the ancient world. There is no event of\r\n     ancient history the details of which are more minutely known. The\r\n     circumstances in all their appalling features are given to us by\r\n     the eye-witness, Josephus, so that we know them as vividly as we do\r\n     the events of the career of Grant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legions had orders to encamp at the distance of six furlongs from\r\nJerusalem, at the mount called the Mount of Olives, which lies over\r\nagainst the city on the east side, and is parted from it by a deep\r\nvalley, interposed between them, which is named Cedron.\r\n\r\nNow, when hitherto the several parties in the city had been dashing one\r\nagainst another perpetually, this foreign war, now suddenly come upon\r\nthem after a violent manner, put the first stop to their contentions one\r\nagainst another; and as the seditious now saw with astonishment the\r\nRomans pitching three several camps, they began to think of an awkward\r\nsort of concord, and said one to another: \"What do we here, and what do\r\nwe mean, when we suffer three fortified walls to be built to coop us in,\r\nthat we shall not be able to breathe freely? while the enemy is securely\r\nbuilding a kind of city in opposition to us, and while we sit still\r\nwithin our own walls and become spectators only of what they are doing,\r\nwith our hands idle, and our armor laid by, as if they were about\r\nsomewhat that was for our good and advantage. We are, it seems (so did\r\nthey cry out), only courageous against ourselves, while the Romans are\r\nlikely to gain the city without bloodshed by our sedition.\" Thus did\r\nthey encourage one another when they were gotten together and took their\r\narmor immediately and ran out upon the Tenth legion and fell upon the\r\nRomans with great eagerness, and with a prodigious shout, as they were\r\nfortifying their camp. These Romans were caught in different parties,\r\nand this in order to perform their several works, and on that account\r\nhad in great measure laid aside their arms, for they thought the Jews\r\nwould not have ventured to make a sally upon them; and had they been\r\ndisposed so to do, they supposed their sedition would have distracted\r\nthem. So they were put into disorder unexpectedly; when some of them\r\nleft their works they were about and immediately marched off, while many\r\nran to their arms, but were smitten and slain before they could turn\r\nback upon the enemy. The Jews became still more and more in number, as\r\nencouraged by the good success of those that first made the attack; and\r\nwhile they had such good fortune, they seemed both to themselves and to\r\nthe enemy to be many more than they really were.\r\n\r\nThe disorderly way of their fighting at first put the Romans also to a\r\nstand, who had been constantly used to fight skilfully in good order,\r\nand with keeping their ranks and obeying the orders that were given\r\nthem, for which reason the Romans were caught unexpectedly and were\r\nobliged to give way to the assaults that were made upon them. Now, when\r\nthese Romans were overtaken and turned back upon the Jews, they put a\r\nstop to their career; yet when they did not take care enough of\r\nthemselves through the vehemency of their pursuit, they were wounded by\r\nthem; but as still more and more Jews sallied out of the city, the\r\nRomans were at length brought into confusion, and put to flight, and ran\r\naway from their camp. Nay, things looked as though the entire legion\r\nwould have been in danger, unless Titus had been informed of the case\r\nthey were in, and had sent them succors immediately. So he reproached\r\nthem for their cowardice and brought those back that were running away,\r\nand fell himself upon the Jews on their flank, with those select troops\r\nthat were with him, and slew a considerable number, and wounded more of\r\nthem, and put them all to flight, and made them run away hastily down\r\nthe valley. Now as these Jews suffered greatly in the declivity of the\r\nvalley, so when they were gotten over it they turned about and stood\r\nover against the Romans, having the valley between them, and there\r\nfought with them. Thus did they continue the fight till noon; but when\r\nit was already a little after noon, Titus set those that came to the\r\nassistance of the Romans with him, and those that belonged to the\r\ncohorts, to prevent the Jews from making any more sallies, and then sent\r\nthe rest of the legion to the upper part of the mountain, to fortify\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\nThis march of the Romans seemed to the Jews to be a flight; and as the\r\nwatchman who was placed upon the wall gave a signal by shaking his\r\ngarment, there came out a fresh multitude of Jews, and that with such\r\nmighty violence that one might compare it to the running of the most\r\nterrible wild beasts. To say the truth, none of those that opposed them\r\ncould sustain the fury with which they made their attacks; but, as if\r\nthey had been cast out of an engine, they brake the enemies' ranks to\r\npieces, who were put to flight, and ran away to the mountain; none but\r\nTitus himself, and a few others with him, being left in the midst of the\r\nacclivity. Now these others, who were his friends, despised the danger\r\nthey were in and were ashamed to leave their general, earnestly\r\nexhorting him to give way to these Jews that are fond of dying, and not\r\nto run into such dangers before those that ought to stay before him; to\r\nconsider what his fortune was, and not, by supplying the place of a\r\ncommon soldier, to venture to turn back upon the enemy so suddenly; and\r\nthis because he was general in the war, and lord of the habitable earth,\r\non whose preservation the public affairs do all depend.\r\n\r\nThese persuasions Titus seemed not so much as to hear, but opposed those\r\nthat ran upon him, and smote them on the face; and when he had forced\r\nthem to go back, he slew them: he also fell upon great numbers as they\r\nmarched down the hill, and thrust them forward; while those men were so\r\namazed at his courage and his strength that they could not fly directly\r\nto the city, but declined from him on both sides, and pressed after\r\nthose that fled up the hill; yet did he still fall upon their flank, and\r\nput a stop to their fury. In the mean time a disorder and a terror fell\r\nagain upon those that were fortifying their camp at the top of the\r\nhill, upon their seeing those beneath them running away; insomuch that\r\nthe whole legion was dispersed while they thought that the sallies of\r\nthe Jews upon them were plainly insupportable, and that Titus was\r\nhimself put to flight, because they took it for granted that, if he had\r\nstayed, the rest would never have fled for it. Thus were they\r\nencompassed on every side by a kind of panic fear, and some dispersed\r\nthemselves one way, and some another, till certain of them saw their\r\ngeneral in the very midst of an action, and being under great concern\r\nfor him, they loudly proclaimed the danger he was in to the entire\r\nlegion; and now shame made them turn back, and they reproached one\r\nanother that they did worse than run away, by deserting Cæsar. So they\r\nused their utmost force against the Jews, and declining from the\r\nstraight declivity, they drove them on heaps into the bottom of the\r\nvalley. Then did the Jews turn about and fight them; but as they were\r\nthemselves retiring, and now, because the Romans had the advantage of\r\nthe ground and were above the Jews, they drove them all into the valley.\r\n\r\nAs now the war abroad ceased for a while, the sedition within was\r\nrevived; and on the feast of unleavened bread, which was now come, it\r\nbeing the fourteenth day of the month Xanthicus [Nisan], when it is\r\nbelieved the Jews were first freed from the Egyptians, Eleazar and his\r\nparty opened the gates of this [inmost court of the] Temple, and\r\nadmitted such of the people as were desirous to worship God into it. But\r\nJohn made use of this festival as a cloak for his treacherous designs,\r\nand armed the most inconsiderable of his own party, the greater part of\r\nwhom were not purified, with weapons concealed under their garments, and\r\nsent them with great zeal into the Temple, in order to seize upon it,\r\nwhich armed men, when they were gotten in, threw their garments away,\r\nand presently appeared in their armor. Upon which there was a very great\r\ndisorder and disturbance about the holy house, while the people, who had\r\nno concern in the sedition, supposed that this assault was made against\r\nall without distinction, as the Zealots thought it was made against\r\nthemselves only. So these left off guarding the gates any longer and\r\nleaped down from their battlements before they came to an engagement,\r\nand fled away into the subterranean caverns of the Temple, while the\r\npeople that stood trembling at the altar and about the holy house were\r\nrolled on heaps together and trampled upon, and were beaten both with\r\nwooden and with iron weapons without mercy. Such also as had differences\r\nwith others slew many persons that were quiet, out of their own private\r\nenmity and hatred, as if they were opposite to the seditious; and all\r\nthose that had formerly offended any of these plotters were now known,\r\nand were now led away to the slaughter, and when they had done abundance\r\nof horrid mischief to the guiltless they granted a truce to the guilty\r\nand let those go off that came out of the caverns. These followers of\r\nJohn also did now seize upon this inner temple, and upon all the warlike\r\nengines therein, and then ventured to oppose Simon. And thus that\r\nsedition, which had been divided into three factions, was now reduced to\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nBut Titus, intending to pitch his camp nearer to the city than Scopus,\r\nplaced as many of his choice horsemen and footmen as he thought\r\nsufficient opposite to the Jews to prevent their sallying out upon them,\r\nwhile he gave orders for the whole army to level the distance as far as\r\nthe wall of the city. So they threw down all the hedges and walls which\r\nthe inhabitants had made about their gardens and groves of trees, and\r\ncut down all the fruit trees that lay between them and the wall of the\r\ncity, and filled up all the hollow places and the chasms, and demolished\r\nthe rocky precipices with iron instruments; and thereby made all the\r\nplace level from Scopus to Herod's monuments, which adjoined to the pool\r\ncalled the Serpent's Pool.\r\n\r\nNow at this very time the Jews contrived the following stratagem against\r\nthe Romans. The bolder sort of the seditious went out at the towers,\r\ncalled the Women's Towers, as if they had been ejected out of the city\r\nby those who were for peace, and rambled about as if they were afraid of\r\nbeing assaulted by the Romans, and were in fear of one another, while\r\nthose that stood upon the wall and seemed to be of the people's side\r\ncried out aloud for peace, and entreated they might have security for\r\ntheir lives given them, and called for the Romans, promising to open the\r\ngates to them; and as they cried out after that manner they threw stones\r\nat their own people, as though they would drive them away from the\r\ngates. These also pretended that they were excluded by force, and that\r\nthey petitioned those that were within to let them in; and rushing upon\r\nthe Romans perpetually, with violence, they then came back, and seemed\r\nto be in great disorder. Now the Roman soldiers thought this cunning\r\nstratagem of theirs was to be believed real, and thinking they had the\r\none party under their power, and could punish them as they pleased, and\r\nhoping that the other party would open their gates to them, set to the\r\nexecution of their designs accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut for Titus himself, he had this surprising conduct of the Jews in\r\nsuspicion, for whereas he had invited them to come to terms of\r\naccommodation, by Josephus, but one day before, he could then receive no\r\ncivil answer from them; so he ordered the soldiers to stay where they\r\nwere. However, some of them that were set in the front of the works\r\nprevented him, and catching up their arms ran to the gates; whereupon\r\nthose that seemed to have been ejected at the first retired; but as soon\r\nas the soldiers were gotten between the towers on each side of the gate\r\nthe Jews ran out and encompassed them round, and fell upon them behind,\r\nwhile that multitude which stood upon the wall threw a heap of stones\r\nand darts of all kinds at them, insomuch that they slew a considerable\r\nnumber, and wounded many more, for it was not easy for the Romans to\r\nescape, by reason those behind them pressed them forward; besides which,\r\nthe shame they were under for being mistaken, and the fear they were in\r\nof their commanders, engaged them to persevere in their mistake;\r\nwherefore they fought with their spears a great while, and received many\r\nblows from the Jews, though indeed they gave them as many blows again,\r\nand at last repelled those that had encompassed them about, while the\r\nJews pursued them as they retired, and followed them, and threw darts at\r\nthem as far as the monuments of Queen Helena.\r\n\r\nNow the warlike men that were in the city, and the multitude of the\r\nseditious that were with Simon, were ten thousand, besides the Idumeans.\r\nThose ten thousand had fifty commanders, over whom this Simon was\r\nsupreme. The Idumeans that paid him homage were five thousand, and had\r\neight commanders, among whom those of greatest fame were Jacob, the son\r\nof Sosas, and Simon, the son of Cathlas. John, who had seized upon the\r\nTemple, had six thousand armed men under twenty commanders; the Zealots\r\nalso that had come over to him and left off their opposition were two\r\nthousand four hundred, and had the same commander that they had\r\nformerly, Eleazar, together with Simon, the son of Arinus. Now, while\r\nthese factions fought one against another, the people were their prey on\r\nboth sides, and that part of the people who would not join with them in\r\ntheir wicked practices were plundered by both factions.\r\n\r\nSimon held the upper city and the great wall as far as Cedron, and as\r\nmuch of the old wall as bent from Siloam to the east, and which went\r\ndown to the palace of Monobazus, who was king of the Adiabeni, beyond\r\nEuphrates; he also held that fountain and the Acra, which was no other\r\nthan the lower city; he also held all that reached to the palace of\r\nQueen Helena, the mother of Monobazus. But John held the Temple and the\r\nparts thereto adjoining, for a great way, as also Ophla, and the valley\r\ncalled \"the Valley of Cedron\"; and when the parts that were interposed\r\nbetween their possessions were burned by them, they left a space wherein\r\nthey might fight with each other, for this internal sedition did not\r\ncease even when the Romans were encamped near their very walls. But\r\nalthough they had grown wiser at the first onset the Romans made upon\r\nthem, this lasted but awhile, for they returned to their former madness,\r\nand separated one from another, and fought it out and did everything\r\nthat the besiegers could desire them to do, for they never suffered\r\nanything that was worse from the Romans than they made each other\r\nsuffer; nor was there any misery endured by the city, after these men's\r\nactions, that could be esteemed new. But it was most of all unhappy\r\nbefore it was overthrown, while those that took it did it a greater\r\nkindness; for I venture to affirm that the sedition destroyed the city,\r\nand the Romans destroyed the sedition, which it was a much harder thing\r\nto do than to destroy the walls; so that we may justly ascribe our\r\nmisfortunes to our own people, and the just vengeance taken on them to\r\nthe Romans; as to which matter let everyone determine by the actions on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nNow when affairs within the city were in this posture, Titus went round\r\nthe city on the outside with some chosen horsemen and looked about for\r\na proper place where he might make an impression upon the walls; but as\r\nhe was in doubt where he could possibly make an attack on any side--for\r\nthe place was no way accessible where the valleys were, and on the other\r\nside the first wall appeared too strong to be shaken by the engines--he\r\nthereupon thought it best to make his assault upon the monument of John,\r\nthe high-priest, for there it was that the first fortification was\r\nlower, and the second was not joined to it, the builders neglecting to\r\nbuild strong where the new city was not much inhabited. Here also was an\r\neasy passage to the third wall, through which he thought to take the\r\nupper city and, through the tower of Antonia, the Temple itself. But at\r\nthis time, as he was going round about the city, one of his friends,\r\nwhose name was Nicanor, was wounded with a dart on his left shoulder, as\r\nhe approached, together with Josephus, too near the wall, and attempted\r\nto discourse to those that were upon the wall about terms of peace, for\r\nhe was a person known by them.\r\n\r\nOn this account it was that Cæsar, as soon as he knew their vehemence,\r\nthat they would not bear even such as approached them to persuade them\r\nto what tended to their own preservation, was provoked to press on the\r\nsiege. He also, at the same time, gave his soldiers leave to set the\r\nsuburbs on fire, and ordered that they should bring timber together, and\r\nraise banks against the city. And when he had parted his army into three\r\nparts, in order to set about those works, he placed those that shot\r\ndarts, and the archers in the midst of the banks that were then raising,\r\nbefore whom he placed those engines that threw javelins and darts and\r\nstones, that he might prevent the enemy from sallying out upon their\r\nworks and might hinder those that were upon the wall from being able to\r\nobstruct them. So the trees were now cut down immediately and the\r\nsuburbs left naked. But now while the timber was being carried to raise\r\nthe banks, and the whole army was earnestly engaged in their works, the\r\nJews were not, however, quiet. And it happened that the people of\r\nJerusalem, who had been hitherto plundered and murdered, were now of\r\ngood courage, and supposed they should have a breathing time, while the\r\nothers were very busy in opposing their enemies without the city, and\r\nthat they should now be avenged on those that had been the authors of\r\ntheir miseries, in case the Romans did but get the victory.\r\n\r\nHowever, John stayed behind, out of his fear of Simon, even while his\r\nown men were earnest in making a sally upon their enemies without. Yet\r\ndid not Simon lie still, for he lay near the place of the siege; he\r\nbrought his engines of war and disposed of them at due distances upon\r\nthe wall, both those which they took from Cestius formerly, and those\r\nwhich they got when they seized the garrison that lay in the tower\r\nAntonia. But though they had these engines in their possession, they had\r\nso little skill in using them that they were in great measure useless to\r\nthem; but a few there were who had been taught by deserters how to use\r\nthem, which they did use, though after an awkward manner. So they cast\r\nstones and arrows at those that were making the banks; they also ran out\r\nupon them by companies and fought with them.\r\n\r\nNow those that were at work covered themselves with hurdles spread over\r\ntheir banks, and their engines were opposed to them when they made their\r\nexcursions. The engines, that all the legions had ready prepared for\r\nthem, were admirably contrived; but still more extraordinary ones\r\nbelonged to the Tenth legion: those that threw darts and those that\r\nthrew stones were more forcible and larger than the rest, by which they\r\nnot only repelled the excursions of the Jews, but drove those away that\r\nwere upon the walls also. Now the stones that were cast were of the\r\nweight of a talent, and were carried two furlongs and farther. The blow\r\nthey gave was no way to be sustained, not only by those that stood first\r\nin the way, but by those that were beyond them for a great space.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jews, they at first watched the coming of the stone, for it\r\nwas of a white color, and could therefore not only be perceived by the\r\ngreat noise it made, but could be seen also before it came, by its\r\nbrightness. Accordingly, the watchmen that sat upon the towers gave them\r\nnotice when the engine was let go, and the stone came from it, and cried\r\nout aloud, in their own country language, \"The son cometh!\" so those\r\nthat were in its way stood off, and threw themselves down upon the\r\nground; by which means, and by their thus guarding themselves, the stone\r\nfell down and did them no harm. But the Romans contrived how to prevent\r\nthat, by blacking the stone, who then could aim at them with success\r\nwhen the stone was not discerned beforehand as it had been till then;\r\nand so they destroyed many of them at one blow. Yet did not the Jews,\r\nunder all this distress, permit the Romans to raise their banks in\r\nquiet, but they shrewdly and boldly exerted themselves, and repelled\r\nthem both by night and by day.\r\n\r\nAnd now, upon the finishing the Roman works, the workmen measured the\r\ndistance there was from the wall, and this by lead and a line which they\r\nthrew to it from their banks, for they could not measure it any other\r\nwise, because the Jews would shoot at them, if they came to measure it\r\nthemselves. And when they found that the engines could reach the wall\r\nthey brought them thither. Then did Titus set his engines, at proper\r\ndistances, so much nearer to the wall that the Jews might not be able to\r\nrepel them, and gave orders they should go to work; and when, thereupon,\r\na prodigious noise echoed round about from three places, and that on a\r\nsudden there was a great noise made by the citizens that were within the\r\ncity, and no less a terror fell upon the seditious themselves. Whereupon\r\nboth sorts, seeing the common danger they were in, contrived to make a\r\nlike defence. So those of different factions cried out one to another\r\nthat they acted entirely as in concert with their enemies, whereas they\r\nought, however, notwithstanding God did not grant them a lasting concord\r\nin their present circumstances, to lay aside their enmities one against\r\nanother and to unite together against the Romans. Accordingly, Simon\r\ngave those that came from the Temple leave, by proclamation, to go upon\r\nthe wall; John also himself, though he could not believe Simon was in\r\nearnest, gave them the same leave.\r\n\r\nSo on both sides they laid aside their hatred and their peculiar\r\nquarrels, and formed themselves into one body. They then ran round the\r\nwalls, and having a vast number of torches with them threw them at the\r\nmachines, and shot darts perpetually upon those that impelled those\r\nengines which battered the wall--nay, the bolder sort leaped out by\r\ntroops upon the hurdles that covered the machines, and pulled them to\r\npieces, and fell upon those that belonged to them, and beat them, not so\r\nmuch by any skill they had, as principally by the boldness of their\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Titus himself still sent assistance to those that were the\r\nhardest beset, and placed both horsemen and archers on the several sides\r\nof the engines, and thereby beat off those that brought the fire to\r\nthem. He also thereby repelled those that shot stones or darts from the\r\ntowers, and then set the engines to work in good earnest; yet did not\r\nthe wall yield to these blows, excepting where the battering ram of the\r\nFifteenth legion moved the corner of a tower, while the wall itself\r\ncontinued unhurt, for the wall was not presently in the same danger with\r\nthe tower, which was extant far above it; nor could the fall of that\r\npart of the tower easily break down any part of the wall itself together\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Jews intermitted their sallies for a while, but when they\r\nobserved the Romans dispersed all abroad at their works, and in their\r\nseveral camps--for they thought the Jews had retired out of weariness\r\nand fear--they all at once made a sally at the tower Hippicus, through\r\nan obscure gate, and at the same time brought fire to burn the works,\r\nand went boldly up to the Romans, and to their very fortifications\r\nthemselves, where, at the cry they made, those that were near them came\r\npresently to their assistance, and those farther off came running after\r\nthem. And here the boldness of the Jews was too hard for the good order\r\nof the Romans, and as they beat those whom they first fell upon, so they\r\npressed upon those that were now gotten together. So this fight about\r\nthe machines was very hot, while the one side tried hard to set them on\r\nfire, and the other side to prevent it. On both sides there was a\r\nconfused cry made, and many of those in the forefront of the battle were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Jews were now too hard for the Romans by the furious\r\nassaults they made like madmen, and the fire caught hold of the works,\r\nand both all those works, and the engines themselves, had been in danger\r\nof being burned, had not many of those select soldiers that came from\r\nAlexandria opposed themselves to prevent it, and had they not behaved\r\nthemselves with greater courage than they themselves supposed they could\r\nhave done, for they outdid those in this fight that had greater\r\nreputation than themselves. This was the state of things till Cæsar took\r\nthe stoutest of his horsemen and attacked the enemy, while he himself\r\nslew twelve of those that were in the forefront of the Jews, which death\r\nof these men, when the rest of the multitude saw, they gave way, and he\r\npursued them, and drove them all into the city, and saved the works from\r\nthe fire. Now it happened at this fight that a certain Jew was taken\r\nalive who, by Titus' order, was crucified before the wall, to see\r\nwhether the rest of them would be affrighted and abate of their\r\nobstinacy. But after the Jews were retired, John,[38] who was commander\r\nof the Idumeans, and was talking to a certain soldier of his\r\nacquaintance before the wall, was wounded by a dart shot at him by an\r\nArabian, and died immediately, leaving the greatest lamentation to the\r\nJews, and sorrow to the seditious, for he was a man of great eminence,\r\nboth for his actions and his conduct also.\r\n\r\nNow, on the next night, a surprising disturbance fell upon the Romans;\r\nfor whereas Titus had given orders for the erection of three towers of\r\nfifty cubits high, that, by setting men upon them at every bank, he\r\nmight from thence drive those away who were upon the wall, it so\r\nhappened that one of these towers fell down about midnight, and as its\r\nfall made a very great noise, fear fell upon the army, and they,\r\nsupposing that the enemy was coming to attack them, ran all to their\r\narms. Whereupon a disturbance and a tumult arose among the legions, and\r\nas nobody could tell what had happened, they went on after a\r\ndisconsolate manner; and seeing no enemy appear, they were afraid one of\r\nanother, and every one demanded of his neighbor the watchword with great\r\nearnestness as though the Jews had invaded their camp. And now were they\r\nlike people under a panic fear, until Titus was informed of what had\r\nhappened, and gave orders that all should be acquainted with it; and\r\nthen, though with some difficulty, they got clear of the disturbance\r\nthey had been under.\r\n\r\nNow these towers were very troublesome to the Jews, who otherwise\r\nopposed the Romans very courageously, for they shot at them out of their\r\nlighter engines from those towers, as they did also by those that threw\r\ndarts, and the archers, and those that flung stones. For neither could\r\nthe Jews reach those that were over them, by reason of their height;\r\nand it was not practicable to take them, nor to overturn them, they were\r\nso heavy, nor to set them on fire, because they were covered with plates\r\nof iron. So they retired out of the reach of the darts, and did no\r\nlonger endeavor to hinder the impression of their rams, which, by\r\ncontinually beating upon the wall, did gradually prevail against it; so\r\nthat the wall already gave way to the Nico, for by that name did the\r\nJews themselves call the greatest of their engines, because it conquered\r\nall things. And now they were for a long while grown weary of fighting\r\nand of keeping guards, and were retired to lodge in the night-time at a\r\ndistance from the wall. It was on other accounts also thought by them to\r\nbe superfluous to guard the wall, there being besides that two other\r\nfortifications still remaining, and they being slothful, and their\r\ncounsels having been ill-concerted on all occasions; so a great many\r\ngrew lazy and retired. Then the Romans mounted the breach, where Nico\r\nhad made one, and all the Jews left the guarding that wall and retreated\r\nto the second wall; so those that had gotten over that wall opened the\r\ngates and received all the army within it. And thus did the Romans get\r\npossession of this first wall, on the fifteenth day of the siege, which\r\nwas the seventh day of the month Artemisius (Jyar), when they demolished\r\na great part of it, as well as they did of the northern parts of the\r\ncity, which had been demolished also by Cestius formerly.\r\n\r\nAnd now Titus pitched his camp within the city, at that place which was\r\ncalled \"the Camp of the Assyrians,\" having seized upon all that lay as\r\nfar as Cedron, but took care to be out of the reach of the Jews' darts.\r\nHe then presently began his attacks, upon which the Jews divided\r\nthemselves into several bodies, and courageously defended that wall,\r\nwhile John[39] and his faction did it from the tower of Antonia, and\r\nfrom the northern cloister of the Temple, and fought the Romans before\r\nthe monuments of King Alexander; and Simon's army also took for their\r\nshare the spot of ground that was near John's monument,[40] and\r\nfortified it as far as to that gate where water was brought in to the\r\ntower Hippicus. However, the Jews made violent sallies, and that\r\nfrequently also, and in bodies together out of the gates, and there\r\nfought the Romans; and when they were pursued all together to the wall,\r\nthey were beaten in those fights, as wanting the skill of the Romans.\r\nBut when they fought them from the walls they were too hard for them;\r\nthe Romans being encouraged by their power, joined to their skill, as\r\nwere the Jews by their boldness, which was nourished by the fear they\r\nwere in, and that hardiness which is natural to our nation under\r\ncalamities; they were also encouraged still by the hope of deliverance,\r\nas were the Romans by their hopes of subduing them in a little time.\r\n\r\nNor did either side grow weary; but attacks and fightings upon the wall,\r\nand perpetual sallies out in bodies, were there all the day long; nor\r\nwere there any sort of warlike engagements that were not then put in\r\nuse. And the night itself had much ado to part them, when they began to\r\nfight in the morning--nay, the night itself was passed without sleep on\r\nboth sides, and was more uneasy than the day to them, while the one was\r\nafraid lest the wall should be taken, and the other lest the Jews should\r\nmake sallies upon their camps; both sides also lay in their armor during\r\nthe night-time, and thereby were ready at the first appearance of light\r\nto go to the battle. Now among the Jews the ambition was who should\r\nundergo the first dangers, and thereby gratify their commanders. Above\r\nall, they had a great veneration and dread of Simon; and to that degree\r\nwas he regarded by every one of those that were under him, that at his\r\ncommand they were very ready to kill themselves with their own hands.\r\n\r\nWhat made the Romans so courageous was their usual custom of conquering\r\nand disuse of being defeated, their constant wars, and perpetual warlike\r\nexercises, and the grandeur of their dominion. And what was now their\r\nchief encouragement--Titus, who was present everywhere with them\r\nall--for it appeared a terrible thing to grow weary while Cæsar was\r\nthere, and fought bravely as well as they did--was himself at once an\r\neye-witness of such as behaved themselves valiantly, and he was to\r\nreward them also. It was, besides, esteemed an advantage at present to\r\nhave anyone's valor known by Cæsar; on which account many of them\r\nappeared to have more alacrity than strength to answer it. And now, as\r\nthe Jews were about this time standing in array before the wall, and\r\nthat in a strong body, and while both parties were throwing their darts\r\nat each other, Longinus, one of the equestrian order, leaped out of the\r\narmy of the Romans, and leaped into the very midst of the army of the\r\nJews; and as they dispersed themselves upon this attack, he slew two of\r\ntheir men of the greatest courage; one of them he struck in his mouth as\r\nhe was coming to meet him, the other was slain by him by that very dart\r\nwhich he drew out of the body of the other, with which he ran this man\r\nthrough his side as he was running away from him; and when he had done\r\nthis, he first of all ran out of the midst of his enemies to his own\r\nside.\r\n\r\nSo this man signalized himself for his valor, and many there were who\r\nwere ambitious of gaining the like reputation. And now the Jews were\r\nunconcerned at what they suffered themselves from the Romans, and were\r\nonly solicitous about what mischief they could do them; and death itself\r\nseemed a small matter to them, if at the same time they could but kill\r\nany one of their enemies. But Titus took care to secure his own soldiers\r\nfrom harm, as well as to have them overcome their enemies. He also said\r\nthat inconsiderate violence was madness, and that this alone was the\r\ntrue courage that was joined with good conduct. He therefore commanded\r\nhis men to take care, when they fought their enemies, that they received\r\nno harm from them at the same time, and thereby show themselves to be\r\ntruly valiant men.\r\n\r\nAnd now Titus brought one of his engines to the middle tower of the\r\nnorth part of the wall, in which a certain crafty Jew, whose name was\r\nCastor, lay in ambush, with ten others like himself, the rest being fled\r\naway by reason of the archers. These men lay still for a while, as in\r\ngreat fear, under their breastplates; but when the tower was shaken,\r\nthey arose, and Castor did then stretch out his hand, as a petitioner,\r\nand called for Cæsar, and by his voice moved his compassion, and begged\r\nof him to have mercy upon them; and Titus, in the innocency of his\r\nheart, believing him to be in earnest, and hoping that the Jews did now\r\nrepent, stopped the working of the battering ram, and forbade them to\r\nshoot at the petitioners, and bid Castor say what he had a mind to say\r\nto him. He said that he would come down, if he would give him his right\r\nhand for his security.\r\n\r\nTo which Titus replied that he was well pleased with such his agreeable\r\nconduct, and would be well pleased if all the Jews would be of his mind,\r\nand that he was ready to give the like security to the city. Now five of\r\nthe ten dissembled with him, and pretended to beg for mercy, while the\r\nrest cried out aloud that they would never be slaves to the Romans,\r\nwhile it was in their power to die in a state of freedom. Now while\r\nthese men were quarrelling for a long while the attack was delayed;\r\nCastor also sent to Simon, and told him that they might take some time\r\nfor consultation about what was to be done, because he would elude the\r\npower of the Romans for a considerable time. And at the same time that\r\nhe sent thus to him, he appeared openly to exhort those that were\r\nobstinate to accept of Titus' hand for their security; but they seemed\r\nvery angry at it, and brandished their naked swords upon the\r\nbreastworks, and struck themselves upon their breast, and fell down as\r\nif they had been slain. Hereupon Titus, and those with him, were amazed\r\nat the courage of the men; and as they were not able to see exactly what\r\nwas done, they admired at their great fortitude and pitied their\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval a certain person shot a dart at Castor, and wounded\r\nhim in his nose; whereupon he presently pulled out the dart, and showed\r\nit to Titus, and complained that this was unfair treatment; so Cæsar\r\nreproved him that shot the dart, and sent Josephus, who then stood by\r\nhim, to give his right hand to Castor. But Josephus said that he would\r\nnot go to him, because these pretended petitioners meant nothing that\r\nwas good; he also restrained those friends of his who were zealous to go\r\nto him. But still there was one Eneas, a deserter, who said he would go\r\nto him. Castor also called to them, that somebody should come and\r\nreceive the money which he had with him; this made Eneas the more\r\nearnestly to run to him with his bosom open. Then did Castor take up a\r\ngreat stone and threw it at him, which missed him, because he guarded\r\nhimself against it; but still it wounded another soldier that was coming\r\nto him. When Cæsar understood that this was a delusion, he perceived\r\nthat mercy in war is a pernicious thing, because such cunning tricks\r\nhave less place under the exercise of greater severity. So he caused the\r\nengine to work more strongly than before, on account of his anger at the\r\ndeceit put upon him. But Castor and his companions set the tower on fire\r\nwhen it began to give way, and leaped through the flame into a hidden\r\nvault that was under it, which made the Romans further suppose that they\r\nwere men of great courage, as having cast themselves into the fire.\r\n\r\nNow Cæsar took this wall there on the fifth day after he had taken the\r\nfirst; and when the Jews had fled from him he entered into it with a\r\nthousand armed men, and those of his choice troops, and this at a place\r\nwhere were the merchants of wool, the braziers, and the market for\r\ncloth, and where the narrow streets led obliquely to the wall.\r\nWherefore, if Titus had either demolished a larger part of the wall\r\nimmediately, or had come in, and, according to the law of war, had laid\r\nwaste what was left, his victory would not, I suppose, have been mixed\r\nwith any loss to himself. But now, out of the hope he had that he should\r\nmake the Jews ashamed of their obstinacy by not being willing, when he\r\nwas able, to afflict them more than he needed to do, he did not widen\r\nthe breach of the wall, in order to make a safer retreat upon occasion,\r\nfor he did not think they would lay snares for him that did them such a\r\nkindness. When therefore, he came in, he did not permit his soldiers to\r\nkill any of those they caught, nor to set fire to their houses\r\nneither--nay, he gave leave to the seditious, if they had a mind, to\r\nfight without any harm to the people, and promised to restore the\r\npeople's effects to them, for he was very desirous to preserve the city\r\nfor his own sake, and the Temple for the sake of the city.\r\n\r\nAs to the people, he had them of a long time ready to comply with his\r\nproposals; but as to the fighting men, this humanity of his seemed a\r\nmark of his weakness, and they imagined that he made these proposals\r\nbecause he was not able to take the rest of the city. They also\r\nthreatened death to the people, if they should any one of them say a\r\nword about a surrender. They, moreover, cut the throats of such as\r\ntalked of a peace, and then attacked those Romans that were come within\r\nthe wall. Some of them they met in the narrow streets, and some they\r\nfought against from their houses, while they made a sudden sally out at\r\nthe upper gates, and assaulted such Romans as were beyond the wall, till\r\nthose that guarded the wall were so affrighted that they leaped down\r\nfrom their towers and retired to their several camps: upon which a great\r\nnoise was made by the Romans that were within, because they were\r\nencompassed round on every side by their enemies; as also by them that\r\nwere without, because they were in fear for those that were left in the\r\ncity. Thus did the Jews grow more numerous perpetually, and had great\r\nadvantages over the Romans, by their full knowledge of those narrow\r\nlanes; and they wounded a great many of them, and fell upon them, and\r\ndrove them out of the city.\r\n\r\nNow these Romans were at present forced to make the best resistance they\r\ncould, for they were not able, in great numbers, to get out at the\r\nbreach in the wall, it was so narrow. It is also probable that all those\r\nthat were gotten within had been cut to pieces, if Titus had not sent\r\nthem succors, for he ordered the archers to stand at the upper ends of\r\nthese narrow lanes, and he stood himself where was the greatest\r\nmultitude of his enemies, and with his darts he put a stop to them; as\r\nwith him did Domitius Sabinus also, a valiant man, and one that in this\r\nbattle appeared so to be. Thus did Cæsar continue to shoot darts at the\r\nJews continually and to hinder them from coming upon his men, and this\r\nuntil all his soldiers had retreated out of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd thus were the Romans driven out, after they had possessed themselves\r\nof the second wall. Whereupon the fighting men that were in the city\r\nwere lifted up in their minds and were elevated upon this their good\r\nsuccess, and began to think that the Romans would never venture to come\r\ninto the city any more; and that if they kept within it themselves they\r\nshould not be any more conquered, for God had blinded their minds for\r\nthe transgressions they had been guilty of, nor could they see how much\r\ngreater forces the Romans had than those that were now expelled, no more\r\nthan they could discern how a famine was creeping upon them, for\r\nhitherto they had fed themselves out of the public miseries and drank\r\nthe blood of the city. But now poverty had for a long time seized upon\r\nthe better part, and a great many had died already for want of\r\nnecessaries, although the seditious indeed supposed the destruction of\r\nthe people to be an easement to themselves, for they desired that none\r\nothers might be preserved but such as were against a peace with the\r\nRomans, and were resolved to live in opposition to them, and they were\r\npleased when the multitude of those of a contrary opinion were consumed,\r\nas being then freed from a heavy burden. And this was their disposition\r\nof mind with regard to those that were within the city, while they\r\ncovered themselves with their armor, and prevented the Romans, when they\r\nwere trying to get into the city again, and made a wall of their own\r\nbodies over against that part of the wall that was cast down.\r\n\r\nThus did they valiantly defend themselves for three days; but on the\r\nfourth day they could not support themselves against the vehement\r\nassaults of Titus, but were compelled by force to fly whither they had\r\nfled before; so he quietly possessed himself again of that wall and\r\ndemolished it entirely. And when he had put a garrison into the towers\r\nthat were on the south parts of the city, he contrived how he might\r\nassault the third wall.\r\n\r\nA resolution was now taken by Titus to relax the siege for a little\r\nwhile, and to afford the seditious an interval for consideration, and to\r\nsee whether the demolishing of their second wall would not make them a\r\nlittle more compliant, or whether they were not somewhat afraid of a\r\nfamine, because the spoils they had gotten by rapine would not be\r\nsufficient for them long; so he made use of this relaxation in order to\r\ncompass his own designs. Accordingly, as the usual appointed time when\r\nhe must distribute subsistence money to the soldiers was now come, he\r\ngave orders that the commanders should put the army into battle array,\r\nin the face of the enemy, and then give every one of the soldiers his\r\npay.\r\n\r\nThe Romans spent four days in bringing this subsistence money to the\r\nseveral legions. But on the fifth day, when no signs of peace appeared\r\nto come from the Jews, Titus divided his legions and began to raise\r\nbanks, both at the tower of Antonia and at John's monument. Now his\r\ndesigns were to take the upper city at that monument, and the Temple at\r\nthe tower of Antonia, for if the Temple were not taken, it would be\r\ndangerous to keep the city itself; so at each of these parts he raised\r\nhim banks, each legion raising one. As for those that wrought at John's\r\nmonument, the Idumeans, and those that were in arms with Simon, made\r\nsallies upon them, and put some stop to them; while John's party, and\r\nthe multitude of Zealots with them, did the like to those that were\r\nbefore the tower of Antonia.\r\n\r\nThese Jews were now too hard for the Romans, not only in direct\r\nfighting, because they stood upon the higher ground, but because they\r\nhad now learned to use their own engines, for their continual use of\r\nthem one day after another did by degrees improve their skill about\r\nthem, for of one sort of engines for darts they had three hundred, and\r\nforty for stones; by the means of which they made it more tedious for\r\nthe Romans to raise their banks. But then Titus, knowing that the city\r\nwould be either saved or destroyed for himself, did not only proceed\r\nearnestly in the siege, but did not omit to have the Jews exhorted to\r\nrepentance; so he mixed good counsel with his works for the siege. And\r\nbeing sensible that exhortations are frequently more effectual than\r\narms, he persuaded them to surrender the city, now in a manner already\r\ntaken, and thereby to save themselves, and sent Josephus to speak to\r\nthem in their own language, for he imagined they might yield to the\r\npersuasion of a countryman of their own.\r\n\r\nAs Josephus was speaking thus with a loud voice, the seditious would\r\nneither yield to what he said, nor did they deem it safe for them to\r\nalter their conduct; but as for the people, they had a great inclination\r\nto desert to the Romans. Accordingly, some of them sold what they had,\r\nand even the most precious things that had been laid up as treasures by\r\nthem, for a very small matter, and swallowed down pieces of gold, that\r\nthey might not be found out by the robbers; and when they had escaped to\r\nthe Romans, went to stool, and had wherewithal to provide plentifully\r\nfor themselves, for Titus let a great number of them go away into the\r\ncountry, whither they pleased. And the main reasons why they were so\r\nready to desert were these: That now they should be freed from those\r\nmiseries which they had endured in that city, and yet should not be in\r\nslavery to the Romans. However John and Simon, with their factions, did\r\nmore carefully watch these men's going out than they did the coming in\r\nof the Romans; and if any one did but afford the least shadow of\r\nsuspicion of such an intention, his throat was cut immediately.\r\n\r\nBut as for the richer sort, it proved all one to them whether they\r\nstayed in the city or attempted to get out of it, for they were equally\r\ndestroyed in both cases, for every such person was put to death under\r\nthis pretence, that they were going to desert, but in reality that the\r\nrobbers might get what they had. The madness of the seditious did also\r\nincrease together with their famine, and both those miseries were every\r\nday inflamed more and more, for there was no corn which anywhere\r\nappeared publicly, but the robbers came running into and searched men's\r\nprivate houses; and then, if they found any, they tormented them,\r\nbecause they had denied they had any; and if they found none, they\r\ntormented them worse, because they supposed they had more carefully\r\nconcealed it. The indication they made use of whether they had any or\r\nnot was taken from the bodies of these miserable wretches, which, if\r\nthey were in good case, they supposed they were in no want at all of\r\nfood; but if they were wasted away, they walked off without searching\r\nany further; nor did they think it proper to kill such as these, because\r\nthey saw they would very soon die of themselves for want of food. Many\r\nthere were indeed who sold what they had for one measure. It was of\r\nwheat, if they were of the richer sort; but of barley, if they were\r\npoorer. When these had so done, they shut themselves up in the inmost\r\nrooms of their houses, and ate the corn they had gotten. Some did it\r\nwithout grinding it, by reason of the extremity of the want they were\r\nin, and others baked bread of it, according as necessity and fear\r\ndictated to them. A table was nowhere laid for a distinct meal, but they\r\nsnatched the bread out of the fire, half-baked, and ate it very hastily.\r\n\r\nIt was now a miserable case, and a sight that would justly bring tears\r\ninto our eyes, how men stood as to their food, while the more powerful\r\nhad more than enough, and the weaker were lamenting [for want of it].\r\nBut the famine was too hard for all other passions, and it is\r\ndestructive to nothing so much as to modesty, for what was otherwise\r\nworthy of reverence was in this case despised; insomuch that children\r\npulled the very morsels that their fathers were eating out of their very\r\nmouths, and what was still more to be pitied, so did the mothers do as\r\nto their infants; and when those that were most dear were perishing\r\nunder their hands, they were not ashamed to take from them the very last\r\ndrops that might preserve their lives; and while they ate after this\r\nmanner, yet were they not concealed in so doing; but the seditious\r\neverywhere came upon them immediately and snatched away from them what\r\nthey had gotten from others, for when they saw any house shut up this\r\nwas to them a signal that the people within had gotten some food;\r\nwhereupon they broke open the doors and ran in and took pieces of what\r\nthey were eating almost up out of their very throats, and this by force;\r\nthe old men who held their food fast were beaten; and if the women hid\r\nwhat they had within their hands, their hair was torn for so doing; nor\r\nwas there any commiseration shown either to the aged or to the infants,\r\nbut they lifted up children from the ground as they hung upon the\r\nmorsels they had gotten and shook them down upon the floor. But still\r\nthey were more barbarously cruel to those that had prevented their\r\ncoming in, and had actually swallowed down what they were going to seize\r\nupon, as if they had been unjustly defrauded of their right.\r\n\r\nThey also invented terrible methods of torments to discover where any\r\nfood was, and they were these: to stop up the passages of the privy\r\nparts of the miserable wretches, and to drive sharp stakes up their\r\nfundaments; and a man was forced to bear what it is terrible even to\r\nhear, in order to make him confess that he had but one loaf of bread, or\r\nthat he might discover a handful of barley meal that was concealed; and\r\nthis was done when these tormentors were not themselves hungry, for the\r\nthing had been less barbarous had necessity forced them to it; but this\r\nwas done to keep their madness in exercise, and as making preparation of\r\nprovisions for themselves for the following days. These men went also to\r\nmeet those that had crept out of the city by night, as far as the Roman\r\nguards, to gather some plants and herbs that grew wild; and when those\r\npeople thought they had got clear of the enemy, they snatched from them\r\nwhat they had brought with them, even while they had frequently\r\nentreated them, and that by calling upon the tremendous name of God, to\r\ngive them back some part of what they had brought, though these would\r\nnot give them the least crumb, and they were to be well contented that\r\nthey were only spoiled and not slain at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to go distinctly over every instance of these men's\r\niniquity. I shall therefore speak my mind here at once briefly: That\r\nneither did any other city ever suffer such miseries, nor did any age\r\never breed a generation more fruitful in wickedness than this was, from\r\nthe beginning of the world. Finally, they brought the Hebrew nation into\r\ncontempt, that they might themselves appear comparatively less impious\r\nwith regard to strangers. They confessed what was true, that they were\r\nthe slaves, the scum, and the spurious and abortive offspring of our\r\nnation, while they overthrew the city themselves, and forced the Romans,\r\nwhether they would or no, to gain a melancholy reputation, by acting\r\ngloriously against them, and did almost draw that fire upon the Temple\r\nwhich they seemed to think came too slowly; and indeed when they saw\r\nthat Temple burning from the upper city, they were neither troubled at\r\nit nor did they shed any tears on that account, while yet these passions\r\nwere discovered among the Romans themselves.\r\n\r\nSo now Titus' banks were advanced a great way, notwithstanding his\r\nsoldiers had been very much distressed from the wall. He then sent a\r\nparty of horsemen and ordered they should lay ambushes for those that\r\nwent out into the valleys to gather food. Some of these were indeed\r\nfighting men, who were not contented with what they got by rapine; but\r\nthe greater part of them were poor people, who were deterred from\r\ndeserting by the concern they were under for their own relations, for\r\nthey could not hope to escape away, together with their wives and\r\nchildren, without the knowledge of the seditious; nor could they think\r\nof leaving these relations to be slain by the robbers on their account;\r\nnay, the severity of the famine made them bold in thus going out; so\r\nnothing remained but that, when they were concealed from the robbers,\r\nthey should be taken by the enemy; and when they were going to be taken\r\nthey were forced to defend themselves for fear of being punished; as\r\nafter they had fought they thought it too late to make any supplications\r\nfor mercy; so they were first whipped and then tormented with all sorts\r\nof tortures before they died, and were then crucified before the wall of\r\nthe city. This miserable procedure made Titus greatly to pity them,\r\nwhile they caught every day five hundred Jews; nay, some days they\r\ncaught more; yet it did not appear to be safe for him to let those that\r\nwere taken by force go their way, and to set a guard over so many he saw\r\nwould be to make such as guarded them useless to him. The main reason\r\nwhy he did not forbid that cruelty was this: that he hoped the Jews\r\nmight perhaps yield at that sight, out of fear lest they might\r\nthemselves afterward be liable to the same cruel treatment. So the\r\nsoldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those\r\nthey caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the\r\ncrosses, by way of jest, when their multitude was so great that room was\r\nwanting for the crosses, and crosses wanting for the bodies.\r\n\r\nBut so far were the seditious from repenting at this sad sight that, on\r\nthe contrary, they made the rest of the multitude believe otherwise, for\r\nthey brought the relations of those that had deserted upon the wall,\r\nwith such of the populace as were very eager to go over upon the\r\nsecurity offered them, and showed them what miseries those underwent who\r\nfled to the Romans; and told them that those who were caught were\r\nsupplicants to them, and not such as were taken prisoners. This sight\r\nkept many of those within the city who were so eager to desert, till the\r\ntruth was known; yet did some of them run away immediately as unto\r\ncertain punishment, esteeming death from their enemies to be a quiet\r\ndeparture, if compared with that by famine. So Titus commanded that the\r\nhands of many of those that were caught should be cut off, that they\r\nmight not be thought deserters, and might be credited on account of the\r\ncalamity they were under, and sent them in to John and Simon, with this\r\nexhortation, that they would now at length leave off (their madness),\r\nand not force him to destroy the city, whereby they would have those\r\nadvantages of repentance, even in their utmost distress, that they would\r\npreserve their own lives, and so find a city of their own, and that\r\nTemple which was their peculiar. He then went round about the banks\r\nthat were cast up, and hastened them, in order to show that his words\r\nshould in no long time be followed by his deeds. In answer to which the\r\nseditious cast reproaches upon Cæsar himself, and upon his father also,\r\nand cried out, with a loud voice, that they contemned death, and did\r\nwell in preferring it before slavery; that they would do all the\r\nmischief to the Romans they could while they had breath in them; and\r\nthat for their own city, since they were, as he said, to be destroyed,\r\nthey had no concern about it, and that the world itself was a better\r\ntemple to God than this. That yet this Temple would be preserved by Him\r\nthat inhabited therein, whom they still had for their assistant in this\r\nwar, and did therefore laugh at all his threatenings, which would come\r\nto nothing, because the conclusion of the whole depended upon God only.\r\nThese words were mixed with reproaches, and with them they made a mighty\r\nclamor.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Antiochus Epiphanes came to the city, having with him a\r\nconsiderable number of other armed men, and a band called the Macedonian\r\nband about him, all of the same age, tall, and just past their\r\nchildhood, armed, and instructed after the Macedonian manner, whence it\r\nwas that they took that name. Antiochus with his Macedonians made a\r\nsudden assault upon the wall; and, indeed, for his own part, his\r\nstrength and skill were so great that he guarded himself from the Jewish\r\ndarts, and yet shot his darts at them, while yet the young men with him\r\nwere almost all sorely galled, for they had so great a regard to the\r\npromises that had been made of their courage, that they would needs\r\npersevere in their fighting, and at length many of them retired, but not\r\ntill they were wounded; and then they perceived that true Macedonians,\r\nif they were to be conquerors, must have Alexander's good fortune also.\r\n\r\nNow as the Romans began to raise their banks on the twelfth day of the\r\nmonth Artemisius [Jyar], so had they much ado to finish them by the\r\ntwenty-ninth day of the same month, after they had labored hard for\r\nseventeen days continually, for there were now four great banks raised,\r\none of which was at the tower Antonia. This was raised by the Fifth\r\nlegion, over against the middle of that pool which was called Struthius.\r\nAnother was cast up by the Twelfth legion at the distance of about\r\ntwenty cubits from the other. But the labors of the Tenth legion, which\r\nlay a great way off these, were on the north quarter, and at the pool\r\ncalled Amygdalon; as was that of the Fifteenth legion about thirty\r\ncubits from it, and at the high-priest's monument. And now, when the\r\nengines were brought, John had from within undermined the space that was\r\nover against the tower of Antonia, as far as the banks themselves, and\r\nhad supported the ground over the mine with beams laid across one\r\nanother, whereby the Roman works stood upon an uncertain foundation.\r\n\r\nThen did he order such materials to be brought in as were daubed over\r\nwith pitch and bitumen, and set them on fire; and as the cross-beams\r\nthat supported the banks were burning, the ditch yielded on the sudden,\r\nand the banks were shaken down, and fell into the ditch with a\r\nprodigious noise. Now at the first, there arose a very thick smoke and\r\ndust, as the fire was choked with the fall of the bank; but as the\r\nsuffocated materials were now gradually consumed, a plain flame brake\r\nout; on which sudden appearance of the flame a consternation fell upon\r\nthe Romans, and the shrewdness of the contrivance discouraged them; and\r\nindeed this accident coming upon them at a time when they thought they\r\nhad already gained their point, cooled their hopes for the time to come.\r\nThey also thought it would be to no purpose to take the pains to\r\nextinguish the fire, since if it were extinguished the banks were\r\nswallowed up already [and become useless to them].\r\n\r\nTwo days after this Simon and his party made an attempt to destroy the\r\nother banks, for the Romans had brought their engines to bear there, and\r\nbegan already to make the wall shake. And here one Tephtheus, of Garsis,\r\na city of Galilee, and Megassarus, one who was derived from some of\r\nQueen Mariamne's servants, and with them one from Adiabene, he was the\r\nson of Nabateus, and called by the name of Chagiras, from the\r\nill-fortune he had, the word signifying \"a lame man,\" snatched some\r\ntorches and ran suddenly upon the engines. Nor were there during this\r\nwar any men that ever sallied out of the city who were their superiors,\r\neither in their boldness or in the terror they struck into their\r\nenemies, for they ran out upon the Romans, not as if they were enemies,\r\nbut friends, without fear or delay; nor did they leave their enemies\r\ntill they had rushed violently through the midst of them, and set their\r\nmachines on fire. And though they had darts thrown at them on every side\r\nand were on every side assaulted with their enemies' swords, yet did\r\nthey not withdraw themselves out of the dangers they were in till the\r\nfire had caught hold of the instruments; but when the flame went up the\r\nRomans came running from their camp to save their engines.\r\n\r\nThen did the Jews hinder their succors from the wall, and fought with\r\nthose that endeavored to quench the fire, without any regard to the\r\ndanger their bodies were in. So the Romans pulled the engines out of the\r\nfire, while the hurdles that covered them were on fire; but the Jews\r\ncaught hold of the battering rams through the flame itself and held them\r\nfast, although the iron upon them was become red hot; and now the fire\r\nspread itself from the engines to the banks, and prevented those that\r\ncame to defend them; and all this while the Romans were encompassed\r\nround about with the flame; and, despairing of saving their works from\r\nit, they retired to their camp. Then did the Jews become still more and\r\nmore in number by the coming of those that were within the city to their\r\nassistance; and as they were very bold upon the good success they had\r\nhad, their violent assaults were almost irresistible--nay, they\r\nproceeded as far as the fortifications of the enemies' camp, and fought\r\nwith their guards.\r\n\r\nNow there stood a body of soldiers in array before that camp, which\r\nsucceeded one another by turns in their armor; and as to those, the law\r\nof the Romans was terrible, that he who left his post there, let the\r\noccasion be whatsoever it might be, he was to die for it; so that body\r\nof soldiers, preferring rather to die in fighting courageously than as a\r\npunishment for their cowardice, stood firm; and at the necessity these\r\nmen were in of standing to it, many of the others that had run away, out\r\nof shame, turned back again; and when they had set the engines against\r\nthe wall they put the multitude from coming more of them out of the city\r\n(which they could the more easily do) because they had made no provision\r\nfor preserving or guarding their bodies at this time; for the Jews\r\nfought now hand-to-hand with all that came in their way, and, without\r\nany caution, fell against the points of their enemies' spears, and\r\nattacked them bodies against bodies, for they were now too hard for the\r\nRomans, not so much by their other warlike actions, as by these\r\ncourageous assaults they made upon them; and the Romans gave way more to\r\ntheir boldness than they did to the sense of the harm they had received\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nAnd now Titus was come from the tower of Antonia, whither he was gone to\r\nlook out for a place for raising other banks, and reproached the\r\nsoldiers greatly for permitting their own walls to be in danger, when\r\nthey had taken the walls of their enemies, and sustained the fortune of\r\nmen besieged, while the Jews were allowed to sally out against them,\r\nthough they were already in a sort of prison. He then went round about\r\nthe enemy with some chosen troops and fell upon their flank himself; so\r\nthe Jews, who had been before assaulted in their faces, wheeled about to\r\nTitus and continued the fight.\r\n\r\nThe armies also were now mixed one among another, and the dust that was\r\nraised so far hindered them from seeing one another, and the noise that\r\nwas made so far hindered them from hearing one another, that neither\r\nside could discern an enemy from a friend. However, the Jews did not\r\nflinch, though not so much from their real strength as from their\r\ndespair of deliverance. The Romans also would not yield, by reason of\r\nthe regard they had to glory and to their reputation in war, and because\r\nCæsar himself went into the danger before them; insomuch that I cannot\r\nbut think the Romans would in the conclusion have now taken even the\r\nwhole multitude of the Jews, so very angry were they at them, had these\r\nnot prevented the upshot of the battle, and retired into the city.\r\nHowever, seeing the banks of the Romans were demolished, these Romans\r\nwere very much cast down upon the loss of what had cost them so long\r\npains, and this in one hour's time. And many indeed despaired of taking\r\nthe city with their usual engines of war only.\r\n\r\nAnd now did Titus consult with his commanders what was to be done. Those\r\nthat were of the warmest tempers thought he should bring the whole army\r\nagainst the city and storm the wall. The opinion of Titus was, that if\r\nthey aimed at quickness joined with security they must build a wall\r\nround about the whole city, and he gave orders that the army should be\r\ndistributed to their several shares of this work. Titus began the wall\r\nfrom the camp of the Assyrians, where his own camp was pitched, and drew\r\nit down to the lower parts of Cenopolis; thence it went along the valley\r\nof Cedron to the Mount of Olives; it then bent toward the south, and\r\nencompassed the mountain as far as the rock called Peristereon, and that\r\nother hill which lies next it, and is over the valley which reaches to\r\nSiloam; whence it bended again to the west, and went down to the valley\r\nof the Fountain, beyond which it went up again at the monument of\r\nAnanus, the high-priest, and encompassing that mountain where Pompey had\r\nformerly pitched his camp, it returned back to the north side of the\r\ncity, and was carried on as far as a certain village called \"The House\r\nof the Erebinthi\"; after which it encompassed Herod's monument, and\r\nthere, on the east, was joined to Titus' own camp, where it began.\r\n\r\nNow the length of this wall was forty furlongs, one only abated. Now at\r\nthis wall without were erected thirteen places to keep garrison in,\r\nwhose circumferences, put together, amounted to ten furlongs; the whole\r\nwas completed in three days; so that what would naturally have required\r\nsome months was done in so short an interval as is incredible. When\r\nTitus had therefore encompassed the city with this wall and put\r\ngarrisons into proper places, he went round the wall, at the first watch\r\nof the night, and observed how the guard was kept; the second watch he\r\nallotted to Alexander; the commanders of legions took the third watch.\r\nThey also cast lots among themselves who should be upon the watch in the\r\nnight-time, and who should go all night long round the spaces that were\r\ninterposed between the garrisons.\r\n\r\nSo all hope of escaping was now cut off from the Jews, together with\r\ntheir liberty of going out of the city. Then did the famine widen its\r\nprogress and devoured the people by whole houses and families; the upper\r\nrooms were full of women and children that were dying by famine, and the\r\nlanes of the city were full of the dead bodies of the aged; the children\r\nalso and the young men wandered about the market-places like shadows,\r\nall swelled with the famine, and fell down dead, wheresoever their\r\nmisery seized them. As for burying them, those that were sick themselves\r\nwere not able to do it; and those that were hearty and well were\r\ndeterred from doing it by the great multitude of those dead bodies, and\r\nby the uncertainty there was how soon they should die themselves, for\r\nmany died as they were burying others, and many went to their coffins\r\nbefore that fatal hour was come. Nor was there any lamentations made\r\nunder these calamities, nor were heard any mournful complaints; but the\r\nfamine confounded all natural passions, for those who were just going to\r\ndie looked upon those that were gone to rest before them with dry eyes\r\nand open mouths.\r\n\r\nA deep silence also, and a kind of deadly night, had seized upon the\r\ncity; while yet the robbers were still more terrible than these miseries\r\nwere themselves, for they brake open those houses which were no other\r\nthan graves of dead bodies, and plundered them of what they had; and\r\ncarrying off the coverings of their bodies went out laughing, and tried\r\nthe points of their swords in their dead bodies; and, in order to prove\r\nwhat metal they were made of, they thrust some of those through that\r\nstill lay alive upon the ground; but for those that entreated them to\r\nlend them their right hand and their sword to despatch them, they were\r\ntoo proud to grant their requests, and left them to be consumed by the\r\nfamine. Now every one of these died with their eyes fixed upon the\r\nTemple, and left the seditious alive behind them. Now the seditious at\r\nfirst gave orders that the dead should be buried out of the public\r\ntreasury, as not enduring the stench of their dead bodies. But\r\nafterward, when they could not do that, they had them cast down from the\r\nwalls into the valleys beneath.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Titus, in going his rounds along those valleys, saw them\r\nfull of dead bodies, and the thick putrefaction running about them, he\r\ngave a groan; and, spreading out his hands to heaven, called God to\r\nwitness that this was not his doing; and such was the sad case of the\r\ncity itself. But the Romans were very joyful, since none of the\r\nseditious could now make sallies out of the city, because they were\r\nthemselves disconsolate, and the famine already touched them also. These\r\nRomans besides had great plenty of corn and other necessaries out of\r\nSyria and out of the neighboring provinces; many of whom would stand\r\nnear to the wall of the city and show the people what great quantities\r\nof provisions they had and so make the enemy more sensible of their\r\nfamine, by the great plenty, even to satiety, which they had themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Josephus, as he was going round the city, had his head\r\nwounded by a stone that was thrown at him; upon which he fell down as\r\ngiddy. Josephus soon recovered of his wound and came out and cried out\r\naloud, that it would not be long ere they should be punished for this\r\nwound they had given him. He also made a fresh exhortation to the people\r\nto come out upon the security that would be given them. This sight of\r\nJosephus encouraged the people greatly and brought a great consternation\r\nupon the seditious.\r\n\r\nHereupon some of the deserters, having no other way, leaped down from\r\nthe wall immediately, while others of them went out of the city with\r\nstones, as if they would fight them; but thereupon they fled away to the\r\nRomans. But here a worse fate accompanied these than what they had found\r\nwithin the city; and they met with a quicker despatch from the too great\r\nabundance they had among the Romans than they could have done from the\r\nfamine among the Jews, for when they came first to the Romans they were\r\npuffed up by the famine and swelled like men in a dropsy; after which\r\nthey all on the sudden overfilled those bodies that were before empty,\r\nand so burst asunder, excepting such only as were skilful enough to\r\nrestrain their appetites, and by degrees took in their food into bodies\r\nunaccustomed thereto.\r\n\r\nYet did another plague seize upon those that were thus preserved, for\r\nthere was found among the Syrian deserters a certain person who was\r\ncaught gathering pieces of gold out of the excrements of the Jews'\r\nbellies, for the deserters used to swallow such pieces of gold, as we\r\ntold you before, when they came out, and for these did the seditious\r\nsearch them all; for there was a great quantity of gold in the city,\r\ninsomuch that as much was now sold [in the Roman camp] for twelve Attic\r\n[drachmas] as was sold before for twenty-five. But when this contrivance\r\nwas discovered in one instance, the fame of it filled their several\r\ncamps, that the deserters came to them full of gold. So the multitude\r\nof the Arabians, with the Syrians, cut up those that came as\r\nsupplicants, and searched their bellies. Nor does it seem to me that any\r\nmisery befell the Jews that was more terrible than this, since in one\r\nnight's time about two thousand of these deserters were thus dissected.\r\n\r\nWhen Titus came to the knowledge of this wicked practice, he threatened\r\nthat he would put such men to death if any of them were discovered to be\r\nso insolent as to do so again. Moreover, he gave it in charge to the\r\nlegions, that they should make a search after such as were suspected,\r\nand should bring them to him. But it appeared that the love of money was\r\ntoo great for all their dread of punishment, and a vehement desire of\r\ngain is natural to men, and no passion is so venturesome as\r\ncovetousness. Otherwise such passions have certain bounds and are\r\nsubordinate to fear. But in reality it was God who condemned the whole\r\nnation and turned every course that was taken for their preservation to\r\ntheir destruction. This, therefore, which was forbidden by Cæsar under\r\nsuch a threatening, was ventured upon privately against the deserters,\r\nand these barbarians would go out still and meet those that ran away\r\nbefore any saw them, and looking about them to see that no Roman spied\r\nthem, they dissected them and pulled this polluted money out of their\r\nbowels, which money was still found in a few of them, while yet a great\r\nmany were destroyed by the bare hope there was of thus getting by them,\r\nwhich miserable treatment made many that were deserting to return back\r\nagain into the city.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, why do I relate these particular calamities? while Manneus,\r\nthe son of Lazarus, came running to Titus at this very time and told him\r\nthat there had been carried out through that one gate, which was\r\nintrusted to his care, no fewer than a hundred and fifteen thousand\r\neight hundred and eighty dead bodies in the interval between the\r\nfourteenth day of the month Xanthicus (Nisan), when the Romans pitched\r\ntheir camp by the city, and the first day of the month Panemus (Tamuz).\r\nThis was itself a prodigious multitude; and though this man was not\r\nhimself set as a governor at that gate, yet was he appointed to pay the\r\npublic stipend for carrying these bodies out, and so was obliged of\r\nnecessity to number them, while the rest were buried by their\r\nrelations, though all their burial was but this, to bring them away and\r\ncast them out of the city.\r\n\r\nAfter this man there ran away to Titus many of the eminent citizens and\r\ntold him the entire number of the poor that were dead, and that no fewer\r\nthan six hundred thousand were thrown out at the gates, though still the\r\nnumber of the rest could not be discovered; and they told him further\r\nthat when they were no longer able to carry out the dead bodies of the\r\npoor they laid their corpses on heaps in very large houses and shut them\r\nup therein; as also that a medimno of wheat was sold for a talent; and\r\nthat when, a while afterward, it was not possible to gather herbs, by\r\nreason the city was all walled about, some persons were driven to that\r\nterrible distress as to search the common sewers and old dunghills of\r\ncattle, and to eat the dung which they got there, and what they of old\r\ncould not endure so much as to see they now used for food. When the\r\nRomans barely heard all this they commiserated their case; while the\r\nseditious, who saw it also, did not repent, but suffered the same\r\ndistress to come upon themselves, for they were blinded by that fate\r\nwhich was already coming upon the city, and upon themselves also.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Romans, although they were greatly distressed in getting\r\ntogether their materials, raised their banks in one-and-twenty days,\r\nafter they had cut down all the trees that were in the country that\r\nadjoined to the city, and that for ninety furlongs round about. And when\r\nthe banks were finished, they afforded a foundation for fear both to the\r\nRomans and to the Jews, for the Jews expected that the city would be\r\ntaken unless they could burn those banks, as did the Romans expect that,\r\nif these were once burned down they should never be able to take it, for\r\nthere was a mighty scarcity of materials, and the bodies of the soldiers\r\nbegan to fail with such hard labors, as did their souls faint with so\r\nmany instances of ill-success.\r\n\r\nThe Romans had an advantage, in that their engines for sieges coöperated\r\nwith them in throwing darts and stones as far as the Jews, when they\r\nwere coming out of the city; whereby the man that fell became an\r\nimpediment to him that was next to him, as did the danger of going\r\nfarther make them less zealous in their attempts; and for those that had\r\nrun under the darts some of them were terrified by the good order and\r\ncloseness of the enemies' ranks before they came to a close fight, and\r\nothers were pricked with their spears and turned back again. At length\r\nthey reproached one another for their cowardice, and retired without\r\ndoing anything. This attack was made upon the first day of the month\r\nPanemus (Tamuz).\r\n\r\nSo when the Jews were retreated the Romans brought their engines,\r\nalthough they had all the while stones thrown at them from the tower of\r\nAntonia, and were assaulted by fire and sword, and by all sorts of\r\ndarts, which necessity afforded the Jews to make use of, for although\r\nthese had great dependence on their own wall, and a contempt of the\r\nRoman engines, yet did they endeavor to hinder the Romans from bringing\r\nthem. Now these Romans struggled hard, on the contrary, to bring them,\r\nas deeming that this zeal of the Jews was in order to avoid any\r\nimpression to be made on the tower of Antonia, because its wall was but\r\nweak and its foundations rotten. However, that tower did not yield to\r\nthe blows given it from the engines; yet did the Romans bear the\r\nimpressions made by the enemies' darts which were perpetually cast at\r\nthem, and did not give way to any of those dangers that came upon them\r\nfrom above, and so they brought their engines to bear. But then, as they\r\nwere beneath the other, and were sadly wounded by the stones thrown down\r\nupon them, some of them threw their shields over their bodies, and\r\npartly with their hands and partly with their bodies and partly with\r\ncrows they undermined its foundations, and with great pains they removed\r\nfour of its stones. Then night came upon both sides, and put an end to\r\nthis struggle for the present. However, that night the wall was so\r\nshaken by the battering rams in that place where John had used his\r\nstratagem before, and had undermined their banks, that the ground then\r\ngave way and the wall fell down suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen this accident had unexpectedly happened, the minds of both parties\r\nwere variously affected, for though one would expect that the Jews would\r\nbe discouraged, because this fall of their wall was unexpected by them,\r\nand they had made no provision in that case, yet did they pull up their\r\ncourage, because the tower of Antonia itself was still standing; as was\r\nthe unexpected joy of the Romans at this fall of the wall soon quenched\r\nby the sight they had of another wall, which John and his party had\r\nbuilt within it.\r\n\r\nUpon the fifth day of the month Panemus (Tamuz), twelve of those men\r\nthat were on the forefront and kept watch upon the banks got together\r\nand called to them the standard-bearer of the Fifth legion, and two\r\nothers of a troop of horsemen, and one trumpeter; these went without\r\nnoise, about the ninth hour of the night, through the ruins, to the\r\ntower of Antonia; and when they had cut the throats of the first guards\r\nof the place, as they were asleep, they got possession of the wall and\r\nordered the trumpeter to sound his trumpet. Upon which the rest of the\r\nguard got up on the sudden and ran away before anybody could see how\r\nmany they were that were gotten up, for partly from the fear they were\r\nin and partly from the sound of the trumpet which they heard they\r\nimagined a great number of the enemy were gotten up. But as soon as\r\nCæsar heard the signal he ordered the army to put on their armor\r\nimmediately, and came thither with his commanders, and first of all\r\nascended, as did the chosen men that were with him. And as the Jews were\r\nflying away to the Temple they fell into that mine which John had dug\r\nunder the Roman banks. Then did the seditious of both the bodies of the\r\nJewish army, as well that belonging to John as that belonging to Simon,\r\ndrive them away; and indeed were no way wanting as to the highest degree\r\nof force and alacrity; for they esteemed themselves entirely ruined if\r\nonce the Romans got into the Temple, as did the Romans look upon the\r\nsame thing as the beginning of their entire conquest.\r\n\r\nSo a terrible battle was fought at the entrance of the Temple, while the\r\nRomans were forcing their way, in order to get possession of that\r\nTemple, and the Jews were driving them back to the tower of Antonia; in\r\nwhich battle the darts were on both sides useless, as well as the\r\nspears, and both sides drew their swords and fought it out hand-to-hand.\r\nNow during this struggle the positions of the men were undistinguished\r\non both sides, and they fought at random, the men being intermixed one\r\nwith another and confounded, by reason of the narrowness of the place;\r\nwhile the noise that was made fell on the ear after an indistinct\r\nmanner, because it was so very loud. Great slaughter was now made on\r\nboth sides, and the combatants trod upon the bodies and the armor of\r\nthose that were dead, and dashed them to pieces. Accordingly, to which\r\nside soever the battle inclined, those that had the advantage exhorted\r\none another to go on, as did those that were beaten make great\r\nlamentation. But still there was no room for flight nor for pursuit, but\r\ndisorderly revolutions and retreats, while the armies were intermixed\r\none with another; but those that were in the first ranks were under the\r\nnecessity of killing or being killed, without any way for escaping, for\r\nthose on both sides that came behind forced those before them to go on,\r\nwithout leaving any space between the armies.\r\n\r\nAt length the Jews' violent zeal was too hard for the Romans' skill, and\r\nthe battle already inclined entirely that way; for the fight had lasted\r\nfrom the ninth hour of the night till the seventh hour of the day, while\r\nthe Jews came on in crowds, and had the danger the Temple was in for\r\ntheir motive; the Romans having no more here than a part of their army,\r\nfor those legions, on which the soldiers on that side depended, were not\r\ncome up to them. So it was at present thought sufficient by the Romans\r\nto take possession of the tower of Antonia.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the rest of the Roman army had, in seven days' time,\r\noverthrown [some] foundations of the tower of Antonia, and had made a\r\nready and broad way to the Temple. Then did the legions come near the\r\nfirst court and began to raise their banks. The one bank was over\r\nagainst the northwest corner of the inner temple; another was at that\r\nnorthern edifice which was between the two gates; and of the other two,\r\none was at the western cloister of the outer court of the Temple; the\r\nother against its northern cloister. However these works were thus far\r\nadvanced by the Romans, not without great pains and difficulty, and\r\nparticularly by being obliged to bring their materials from the distance\r\nof a hundred furlongs.\r\n\r\nThey had further difficulties also upon them; sometimes by their\r\nover-great security they were in that they should overcome the Jewish\r\nsnares laid for them, and by that boldness of the Jews which their\r\ndespair of escaping had inspired them withal.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Jews were so distressed by the fights they had been\r\nin, as the war advanced higher and higher, and creeping up to the holy\r\nhouse itself, that they, as it were, cut off those limbs of their body\r\nwhich were infected, in order to prevent the distemper's spreading\r\nfurther, for they set the northwest cloister, which was joined to the\r\ntower of Antonia, on fire, and after that brake off about twenty cubits\r\nof that cloister, and thereby made a beginning in burning the sanctuary;\r\ntwo days after which, or on the twenty-fourth day of the forenamed month\r\n[Panemus or Tamuz], the Romans set fire to the cloister that joined to\r\nthe other, when the fire went fifteen cubits farther. The Jews, in like\r\nmanner, cut off its roof; nor did they entirely leave off what they were\r\nabout till the tower of Antonia was parted from the Temple, even when it\r\nwas in their power to have stopped the fire--nay, they lay still while\r\nthe Temple was first set on fire, and deemed this spreading of the fire\r\nto be for their own advantage. However, the armies were still fighting\r\none against another about the Temple, and the war was managed by\r\ncontinual sallies of particular parties against one another.\r\n\r\nNow of those that perished by famine in the city the number was\r\nprodigious, and the miseries they underwent were unspeakable, for if so\r\nmuch as the shadow of any kind of food did anywhere appear a war was\r\ncommenced presently, and the dearest friends fell a-fighting one with\r\nanother about it, snatching from each other the most miserable supports\r\nof life. Nor would men believe that those who were dying had no food,\r\nbut the robbers would search them when they were expiring, lest anyone\r\nshould have concealed food in his bosom and counterfeited dying; nay,\r\nthese robbers gaped for want, and ran about stumbling and staggering\r\nalong like mad dogs, and reeling against the doors of the houses like\r\ndrunken men; they would also, in the great distress they were in, rush\r\ninto the very same houses two or three times in one and the same day.\r\nMoreover, their hunger was so intolerable that it obliged them to chew\r\neverything, while they gathered such things as the most sordid animals\r\nwould not touch, and endured to eat them; nor did they at length\r\nabstain from girdles and shoes; and the very leather which belonged to\r\ntheir shields they pulled off and gnawed; the very wisps of old hay\r\nbecame food to some; and some gathered up fibres and sold a very small\r\nweight of them for four Attic [drachmas].\r\n\r\nBut why do I describe the shameless impudence that the famine brought on\r\nmen in their eating inanimate things, while I am going to relate a\r\nmatter of fact, the like to which no history relates, either among the\r\nGreeks or barbarians? It is horrible to speak of it and incredible when\r\nheard. I had indeed willingly omitted this calamity of ours, that I\r\nmight not seem to deliver what is so portentous to posterity, but that I\r\nhave innumerable witnesses to it in my own age; and besides, my country\r\nwould have had little reason to thank me for suppressing the miseries\r\nthat she underwent at this time.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain woman that dwelt beyond Jordan, her name was Mary;\r\nher father was Eleazar, of the village Bethezob, which signifies \"the\r\nHouse of Hyssop.\" She was eminent for her family and her wealth, and had\r\nfled away to Jerusalem with the rest of the multitude, and was with them\r\nbesieged therein at this time. The other effects of this woman had been\r\nalready seized upon, such I mean as she had brought with her out of\r\nPerea, and removed to the city. What she had treasured up besides, as\r\nalso what food she had contrived to save, had been also carried off by\r\nthe rapacious guards, who came every day running into her house for that\r\npurpose. This put the poor woman into a very great passion, and by the\r\nfrequent reproaches and imprecations she cast at these rapacious\r\nvillains she had provoked them to anger against her; but none of them,\r\neither out of the indignation she had raised against herself, or out of\r\ncommiseration of her case, would take away her life; and if she found\r\nany food, she perceived her labors were for others, and not for herself;\r\nand it was now become impossible for her any way to find any more food,\r\nwhile the famine pierced through her very bowels and marrow, when also\r\nher passion was fired to a degree beyond the famine itself; nor did she\r\nconsult with anything but with her passion and the necessity she was in.\r\nShe then attempted a most unnatural thing; and snatching up her son, who\r\nwas a child sucking at her breast, she said: \"O thou miserable infant!\r\nfor whom shall I preserve thee in this war, this famine, and this\r\nsedition? As to the war with the Romans, if they preserve our lives we\r\nmust be slaves. This famine also will destroy us even before that\r\nslavery comes upon us. Yet are these seditious rogues more terrible than\r\nboth the other. Come on: be thou my food, and be thou a fury to these\r\nseditious varlets, and a by-word to the world, which is all that is now\r\nwanting to complete the calamities of us Jews.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had said this she slew her son, and then roasted him, and\r\neat the one half of him, and kept the other half by her concealed. Upon\r\nthis the seditious came in presently, and smelling the horrid scent of\r\nthis food, they threatened her that they would cut her throat\r\nimmediately if she did not show them what food she had gotten ready. She\r\nreplied that she had saved a very fine portion of it for them, and\r\nwithal uncovered what was left of her son. Hereupon they were seized\r\nwith a horror and amazement of mind, and stood astonished at the sight,\r\nwhen she said to them: \"This is mine own son, and what hath been done\r\nwas mine own doing! Come, eat of this food, for I have eaten of it\r\nmyself! Do not you pretend to be either more tender than a woman or more\r\ncompassionate than a mother; but if you be so scrupulous and do\r\nabominate this my sacrifice, as I have eaten the one half, let the rest\r\nbe reserved for me also.\" After which those men went out trembling,\r\nbeing never so much affrighted at anything as they were at this, and\r\nwith some difficulty they left the rest of that meat to the mother. Upon\r\nwhich the whole city was full of this horrid action immediately; and\r\nwhile everybody laid this miserable case before their own eyes, they\r\ntrembled, as if this unheard-of action had been done by themselves. So\r\nthose that were thus distressed by the famine were very desirous to die,\r\nand those already dead were esteemed happy, because they had not lived\r\nlong enough either to hear or to see such miseries.\r\n\r\nThis sad instance was quickly told to the Romans, some of whom could not\r\nbelieve it, and others pitied the distress which the Jews were under;\r\nbut there were many of them who were hereby induced to a more bitter\r\nhatred than ordinary against our nation. But for Cæsar, he excused\r\nhimself before God as to this matter, and said that he had proposed\r\npeace and liberty to the Jews, as well as an oblivion of all their\r\nformer insolent practices; but that they, instead of concord, had chosen\r\nsedition; instead of peace, war; and before satiety and abundance, a\r\nfamine. That they had begun with their own hands to burn down that\r\nTemple which we have preserved hitherto, and that therefore they\r\ndeserved to eat such food as this was. That, however, this horrid action\r\nof eating an own child ought to be covered with the overthrow of their\r\nvery country itself, and men ought not to leave such a city upon the\r\nhabitable earth to be seen by the sun wherein mothers are thus fed,\r\nalthough such food be fitter for the fathers than for the mothers to eat\r\nof, since it is they that continue still in a state of war against us,\r\nafter they have undergone such miseries as these. And at the same time\r\nthat he said this, he reflected on the desperate condition these men\r\nmust be in; nor could he expect that such men could be recovered to\r\nsobriety of mind after they had endured those very sufferings, for the\r\navoiding whereof it only was probable they might have repented.\r\n\r\nAnd now two of the legions had completed their banks on the eighth day\r\nof the month Lous [Ab]. Whereupon Titus gave orders that the battering\r\nrams should be brought and set over against the western edifice of the\r\ninner temple; for before these were brought, the firmest of all the\r\nother engines had battered the wall for six days together without\r\nceasing, without making any impression upon it; but the vast largeness\r\nand strong connection of the stones were superior to that engine and to\r\nthe other battering rams also. Other Romans did indeed undermine the\r\nfoundations of the northern gate, and after a world of pains removed the\r\noutermost stones, yet was the gate still upheld by the inner stones, and\r\nstood still unhurt; till the workmen, despairing of all such attempts by\r\nengines and crows, brought their ladders to the cloisters.\r\n\r\nNow the Jews did not interrupt them in so doing; but when they were\r\ngotten up, they fell upon them and fought with them; some of them they\r\nthrust down and threw them backward headlong; others of them they met\r\nand slew; they also beat many of those that went down the ladders again,\r\nand slew them with their swords before they could bring their shields\r\nto protect them; nay, some of the ladders they threw down from above\r\nwhen they were full of armed men. A great slaughter was made of the Jews\r\nalso at the same time, while those that bare the ensigns fought hard for\r\nthem, as deeming it a terrible thing, and what would tend to their great\r\nshame, if they permitted them to be stolen away. Yet did the Jews at\r\nlength get possession of these engines, and destroyed those that had\r\ngone up the ladders, while the rest were so intimidated by what those\r\nsuffered who were slain that they retired; although none of the Romans\r\ndied without having done good service before his death. Of the\r\nseditious, those that had fought bravely in the former battles did the\r\nlike now, as besides them did Eleazar, the brother's son of Simon the\r\ntyrant. But when Titus perceived that his endeavors to spare a foreign\r\ntemple turned to the damage of his soldiers and made them be killed, he\r\ngave order to set the gates on fire.\r\n\r\nBut then, on the next day, Titus commanded part of his army to quench\r\nthe fire and to make a road for the more easy marching up of the\r\nlegions, while he himself gathered the commanders together. Titus\r\nproposed to these that they should give him their advice what should be\r\ndone about the holy house. Now some of these thought it would be the\r\nbest way to act according to the rules of war [and demolish it], because\r\nthe Jews would never leave off rebelling while that house was standing;\r\nat which house it was that they used to get all together. Others of them\r\nwere of opinion that in case the Jews would leave it, and none of them\r\nwould lay their arms up in it, he might save it; but that in case they\r\ngot upon it and fought any more, he might burn it; because it must then\r\nbe looked upon not as a holy house, but as a citadel; and that the\r\nimpiety of burning it would then belong to those that forced this to be\r\ndone, and not to them.\r\n\r\nBut Titus said that \"although the Jews should get upon that holy house\r\nand fight us thence, yet ought we not to revenge ourselves on things\r\nthat are inanimate, instead of the men themselves\"? and that he was not\r\nin any case for burning down so vast a work as that was, because this\r\nwould be a mischief to the Romans themselves, as it would be an\r\nornament to their government while it continued. So Fronto and\r\nAlexander and Cerealis grew bold upon that declaration, and agreed to\r\nthe opinion of Titus. Then was this assembly dissolved, when Titus had\r\ngiven orders to the commanders that the rest of their forces should lie\r\nstill; but that they should make use of such as were most courageous in\r\nthis attack. So he commanded that the chosen men that were taken out of\r\nthe cohorts should make their way through the ruins and quench the fire.\r\n\r\nNow it is true that on this day the Jews were so weary and under such\r\nconsternation that they refrained from any attacks. But on the next day\r\nthey gathered their whole force together, and ran upon those that\r\nguarded the outward court of the Temple very boldly, through the east\r\ngate, and this about the second hour of the day. These guards received\r\ntheir attack with great bravery, and by covering themselves with their\r\nshields before, as if it were with a wall, drew their squadron close\r\ntogether; yet was it evident that they could not abide there very long,\r\nbut would be overborne by the multitude of those that sallied out upon\r\nthem, and by the heat of their passion. However, Cæsar seeing, from the\r\ntower of Antonia, that this squadron was likely to give way, sent some\r\nchosen horsemen to support them. Hereupon the Jews found themselves not\r\nable to sustain their onset, and, upon the slaughter of those in the\r\nforefront, many of the rest were put to flight. But as the Romans were\r\ngoing off, the Jews turned upon them and fought them; and as those\r\nRomans came back upon them, they retreated again, until about the fifth\r\nhour of the day they were overborne, and shut themselves up in the inner\r\n[court of the] Temple.\r\n\r\nSo Titus retired into the tower of Antonia and resolved to storm the\r\nTemple the next day, early in the morning, with his whole army, and to\r\nencamp round about the holy house. But as for that house, God had, for\r\ncertain, long ago doomed it to the fire; and now that fatal day was\r\ncome, according to the revolution of ages. It was the tenth day of the\r\nmonth Lous [Ab] upon which it was formerly burned by the king of\r\nBabylon; although these flames took their rise from the Jews themselves,\r\nand were occasioned by them, for upon Titus' retiring the seditious lay\r\nstill for a little while, and then attacked the Romans again when those\r\nthat guarded the holy house fought with those that quenched the fire\r\nthat was burning the inner [court of the] Temple; but these Romans put\r\nthe Jews to flight and proceeded as far as the holy house itself. At\r\nwhich time one of the soldiers, without staying for any orders and\r\nwithout any concern or dread upon him at so great an undertaking and\r\nbeing hurried on by a certain divine fury, snatched somewhat out of the\r\nmaterials that were on fire, and being lifted up by another soldier he\r\nset fire to a golden window through which there was a passage to the\r\nrooms that were round about the holy house on the north side of it.\r\n\r\nAs the flames went upward the Jews made a great clamor such as so mighty\r\nan affliction required and ran together to prevent it; and now they\r\nspared not their lives any longer nor suffered anything to restrain\r\ntheir force, since that holy house was perishing for whose sake it was\r\nthat they kept such a guard about it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Cæsar was no way able to restrain the enthusiastic fury of the\r\nsoldiers, and the fire proceeded on more and more. He went into the holy\r\nplace of the Temple with his commanders and saw it, with what was in it,\r\nwhich he found to be far superior to what the relations of foreigners\r\ncontained, and not inferior to what we ourselves boasted of and believed\r\nabout it. But as the flame had not as yet reached to its inward parts,\r\nbut was still consuming the rooms that were about the holy house, and\r\nTitus supposing what the fact was, that the house itself might yet be\r\nsaved, came in haste and endeavored to persuade the soldiers to quench\r\nthe fire, and gave order to Liberalius the centurion, and one of those\r\nspearmen that were about him, to beat the soldiers that were refractory\r\nwith their staves and to restrain them; yet were their passions too hard\r\nfor the regards they had for Cæsar, and the dread they had of him who\r\nforbade them, as was their hatred of the Jews, and a certain vehement\r\ninclination to fight them, too hard for them also. Moreover, the hope of\r\nplunder induced many to go on, as having this opinion, that all the\r\nplaces within were full of money, and as seeing that all round about it\r\nwas made of gold. And besides, one of those that went into the place\r\nprevented Cæsar, when he ran so hastily out to restrain the soldiers,\r\nand threw the fire upon the hinges of the gate, in the dark; whereby the\r\nflame burst out from within the holy house itself immediately, when the\r\ncommanders retired, and Cæsar with them, and when nobody any longer\r\nforbade those that were without to set fire to it. And thus was the holy\r\nhouse burned down without Cæsar's approbation.\r\n\r\nWhile the holy house was on fire everything was plundered that came to\r\nhand, and ten thousand of those that were caught were slain; nor was\r\nthere a commiseration of any age, or any reverence of gravity, but\r\nchildren, and old men, and profane persons, and priests were all slain\r\nin the same manner; so that this war went round all sorts of men, and\r\nbrought them to destruction, and as well those that made supplication\r\nfor their lives as those that defended themselves by fighting. The flame\r\nwas also carried a long way, and made an echo, together with the groans\r\nof those that were slain; and because this hill was high, and the works\r\nat the Temple were very great, one would have thought the whole city had\r\nbeen on fire. Nor can one imagine anything either greater or more\r\nterrible than this noise, for there was at once a shout of the Roman\r\nlegions, who were marching all together, and a sad clamor of the\r\nseditious, who were now surrounded with fire and sword.\r\n\r\nThe people also that were left above were beaten back upon the enemy,\r\nand under a great consternation, and made sad moans at the calamity they\r\nwere under; the multitude also that was in the city joined in this\r\noutcry with those that were upon the hill. And besides, many of those\r\nthat were worn away by the famine and their mouths almost closed, when\r\nthey saw the fire of the holy house they exerted their utmost strength\r\nand brake out into groans and outcries again. Perea did also return the\r\necho, as well as the mountains round about [the city], and augmented the\r\nforce of the entire noise. Yet was the misery itself more terrible than\r\nthis disorder, for one would have thought that the hill itself, on which\r\nthe Temple stood, was seething hot, as full of fire on every part of it,\r\nthat the blood was larger in quantity than the fire, and those that were\r\nslain more in number than those that slew them, for the ground did\r\nnowhere appear visible for the dead bodies that lay on it; but the\r\nsoldiers went over heaps of those bodies, as they ran upon such as fled\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that the multitude of the robbers were thrust out [of the\r\ninner court of the Temple] by the Romans, and had much ado to get into\r\nthe outward court, and from thence into the city, while the remainder of\r\nthe populace fled into the cloister of that outer court. As for the\r\npriests, some of them plucked up from the holy house the spikes that\r\nwere upon it, with their bases, which were made of lead, and shot them\r\nat the Romans instead of darts. But then as they gained nothing by so\r\ndoing, and as the fire burst out upon them, they retired to the wall\r\nthat was eight cubits broad, and there they tarried.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Romans, judging that it was in vain to spare what was round\r\nabout the holy house, burned all those places, as also the remains of\r\nthe cloisters and the gates, two excepted: the one on the east side and\r\nthe other on the south; both which, however, they burned afterward. They\r\nalso burned down the treasury chambers, in which was an immense quantity\r\nof money and an immense number of garments and other precious goods\r\nthere reposited; and, to speak all in a few words, there it was that the\r\nentire riches of the Jews were heaped up together, while the rich people\r\nhad there built themselves chambers (to contain such furniture). The\r\nsoldiers also came to the rest of the cloisters that were in the outer\r\n(court of the) Temple, whither the women and children, and a great mixed\r\nmultitude of the people, fled, in number about six thousand. But before\r\nCæsar had determined anything about these people, or given the\r\ncommanders any orders relating to them, the soldiers were in such a rage\r\nthat they set that cloister on fire; by which means it came to pass that\r\nsome of these were destroyed by throwing themselves down headlong, and\r\nsome were burned in the cloisters themselves. Nor did any one of them\r\nescape with his life.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Romans, upon the flight of the seditious into the city, and\r\nupon the burning of the holy house itself and of all the buildings round\r\nabout it, brought their ensigns to the Temple and set them over against\r\nits eastern gate; and there did they offer sacrifices to them, and there\r\ndid they make Titus imperator with the greatest acclamations of joy.\r\nAnd now all the soldiers had such vast quantities of the spoils which\r\nthey had gotten by plunder that in Syria a pound weight of gold was sold\r\nfor half its former value.\r\n\r\nBut as for the tyrants themselves and those that were with them, when\r\nthey found that they were encompassed on every side, and, as it were,\r\nwalled round, without any method of escaping, they desired to treat with\r\nTitus by word of mouth. Accordingly, such was the kindness of his nature\r\nand his desire of preserving the city from destruction, joined to the\r\nadvice of his friends, who now thought the robbers were come to a\r\ntemper, that he placed himself on the western side of the outer (court\r\nof the) Temple, for there were gates on that side above the Xystus, and\r\na bridge that connected the upper city to the Temple. This bridge it was\r\nthat lay between the tyrants and Cæsar, and parted them; while the\r\nmultitude stood on each side; those of the Jewish nation about Simon and\r\nJohn, with great hopes of pardon; and the Romans about Cæsar, in great\r\nexpectation how Titus would receive their supplication.\r\n\r\nSo Titus charged his soldiers to restrain their rage and to let their\r\ndarts alone, and appointed an interpreter between them, which was a sign\r\nthat he was the conqueror, and first began the discourse, and said: \"I\r\nhope you, sirs, are now satiated with the miseries of your country, who\r\nhave not had any just notions either of our great power or of your own\r\ngreat weakness, but have, like madmen, after a violent and inconsiderate\r\nmanner, made such attempts as have brought your people, your city, and\r\nyour holy house to destruction. You have been the men that have never\r\nleft off rebelling since Pompey first conquered you, and have since that\r\ntime made open war with the Romans.... And now, vile wretches, do you\r\ndesire to treat with me by word of mouth? To what purpose is it that you\r\nwould save such a holy house as this was which is now destroyed? What\r\npreservation can you now desire after the destruction of your Temple?\r\nYet do you stand still at this very time in your armor; nor can you\r\nbring yourselves so much as to pretend to be supplicants even in this\r\nyour utmost extremity. O miserable creatures! what is it you depend on?\r\nAre not your people dead? is not your holy house gone? is not your city\r\nin my power? and are not your own very lives in my hands? And do you\r\nstill deem it a part of valor to die? However, I will not imitate your\r\nmadness. If you throw down your arms and deliver up your bodies to me, I\r\ngrant you your lives; and I will act like a mild master of a family;\r\nwhat cannot be healed shall be punished, and the rest I will preserve\r\nfor my own use.\"\r\n\r\nTo that offer of Titus they made this reply: That they could not accept\r\nof it, because they had sworn never to do so; but they desired they\r\nmight have leave to go through the wall that had been made about them,\r\nwith their wives and children; for that they would go into the desert\r\nand leave the city to him.\r\n\r\nAt this Titus had great indignation, that when they were in the case of\r\nmen already taken captives, they should pretend to make their own terms\r\nwith him, as if they had been conquerors. So he ordered this\r\nproclamation to be made to them: That they should no more come out to\r\nhim as deserters, nor hope for any further security, for that he would\r\nhenceforth spare nobody, but fight them with his whole army; and that\r\nthey must save themselves as well as they could, for that he would from\r\nhenceforth treat them according to the laws of war. So he gave orders to\r\nthe soldiers both to burn and to plunder the city; who did nothing\r\nindeed that day; but on the next day they set fire to the repository of\r\nthe archives, to Acra, to the council house, and to the place called\r\nOphlas; at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of Queen\r\nHelena, which was in the middle of Acra; the lanes also were burned\r\ndown, as were also those houses that were full of the dead bodies of\r\nsuch as were destroyed by famine.\r\n\r\nOn the same day it was that the sons and brethren of Izates the King,\r\ntogether with many others of the eminent men of the populace, got\r\ntogether there, and besought Cæsar to give them his right hand for their\r\nsecurity. Upon which, though he was very angry at all that were now\r\nremaining, yet did he not lay aside his old moderation, but received\r\nthese men. At that time, indeed, he kept them all in custody, but still\r\nbound the King's sons and kinsmen, and led them with him to Rome, in\r\norder to make them hostages for their country's fidelity to the Romans.\r\n\r\nAnd now the seditious rushed into the royal palace, into which many had\r\nput their effects, because it was so strong, and drove the Romans away\r\nfrom it. They also slew all the people that had crowded into it, who\r\nwere in number about eight thousand four hundred, and plundered them of\r\nwhat they had.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the Romans drove the robbers out of the lower city and\r\nset all on fire as far as Siloam. These soldiers were indeed glad to see\r\nthe city destroyed. But they missed the plunder, because the seditious\r\nhad carried off all their effects, and were retired into the upper city,\r\nfor they did not yet at all repent of the mischiefs they had done, but\r\nwere insolent, as if they had done well; for, as they saw the city on\r\nfire, they appeared cheerful, and put on joyful countenances, in\r\nexpectation, as they said, of death to end their miseries. Accordingly,\r\nas the people were now slain, the holy house was burned down, and the\r\ncity was on fire, there was nothing further left for the enemy to do.\r\nYet did not Josephus grow weary, even in this utmost extremity, to beg\r\nof them to spare what was left of the city; he spake largely to them\r\nabout their barbarity and impiety, and gave them his advice in order to\r\ntheir escape, though he gained nothing thereby more than to be laughed\r\nat by them; and as they could not think of surrendering themselves up,\r\nbecause of the oath they had taken, nor were strong enough to fight with\r\nthe Romans any longer upon the square, as being surrounded on all sides,\r\nand a kind of prisoners already, yet were they so accustomed to kill\r\npeople that they could not restrain their right hands from acting\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nSo they dispersed themselves before the city and laid themselves in\r\nambush among its ruins, to catch those that attempted to desert to the\r\nRomans. Accordingly, many such deserters were caught by them and were\r\nall slain, for these were too weak, by reason of their want of food, to\r\nfly away from them; so their dead bodies were thrown to the dogs. Now\r\nevery other sort of death was thought more tolerable than the famine,\r\ninsomuch that, though the Jews despaired now of mercy, yet would they\r\nfly to the Romans, and would themselves, even of their own accord, fall\r\namong the murderous rebels also. Nor was there any place in the city\r\nthat had no dead bodies in it, but what was entirely covered with those\r\nthat were killed either by the famine or the rebellion; and all was full\r\nof the dead bodies of such as had perished, either by that sedition or\r\nby the famine.\r\n\r\nSo now the last hope which supported the tyrants and that crew of\r\nrobbers who were with them was in the caves and caverns underground;\r\nwhither, if they could once fly, they did not expect to be searched for;\r\nbut endeavored that, after the whole city should be destroyed and the\r\nRomans gone away, they might come out again and escape from them. This\r\nwas no better than a dream of theirs, for they were not able to lie hid\r\neither from God or from the Romans. However, they depended on these\r\nunderground subterfuges, and set more places on fire than did the Romans\r\nthemselves; and those that fled out of their houses thus set on fire\r\ninto the ditches they killed without mercy, and pillaged them also; and\r\nif they discovered food belonging to anyone they seized upon it and\r\nswallowed it down, together with their blood also--nay, they were now\r\ncome to fight one with another about their plunder; and I cannot but\r\nthink that, had not their destruction prevented it, their barbarity\r\nwould have made them taste of even the dead bodies themselves.\r\n\r\nNow when Cæsar perceived that the upper city was so steep that it could\r\nnot possibly be taken without raising banks against it, he distributed\r\nthe several parts of that work among his army, and this on the twentieth\r\nday of the month Lous [Ab].\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the commanders of the Idumeans got together\r\nprivately and took counsel about surrendering up themselves to the\r\nRomans. Accordingly, they sent five men to Titus and entreated him to\r\ngive them his right hand for their security. So Titus, thinking that the\r\ntyrants would yield, if the Idumeans, upon whom a great part of the war\r\ndepended, were once withdrawn from them, after some reluctancy and delay\r\ncomplied with them, and gave them security for their lives, and sent the\r\nfive men back. But as these Idumeans were preparing to march out, Simon\r\nperceived it, and immediately slew the five men that had gone to Titus,\r\nand took their commanders and put them in prison, of whom the most\r\neminent was Jacob, the son of Sosas; but as for the multitude of the\r\nIdumeans, who did not at all know what to do, now their commanders were\r\ntaken from them, he had them watched, and secured the walls by a more\r\nnumerous garrison. Yet could not that garrison resist those that were\r\ndeserting, for although a great number of them were slain, yet were the\r\ndeserters many more in number. These were all received by the Romans,\r\nbecause Titus himself grew negligent as to his former orders for killing\r\nthem, and because the very soldiers grew weary of killing them, and\r\nbecause they hoped to get some money by sparing them, for they left only\r\nthe populace, and sold the rest of the multitude, with their wives and\r\nchildren, and every one of them at a very low price, and that because\r\nsuch as were sold were very many, and the buyers were few; and although\r\nTitus had made proclamation beforehand that no deserter should come\r\nalone by himself, that so they might bring out their families with them,\r\nyet did he receive such as these also.\r\n\r\nHowever, he set over them such as were to distinguish some from others,\r\nin order to see if any of them deserved to be punished. And indeed the\r\nnumber of those that were sold was immense; but of the populace above\r\nforty thousand were saved, whom Cæsar let go whither every one of them\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nBut now at this time it was that one of the priests, the son of\r\nThebuthus, whose name was Jesus, upon his having security given him, by\r\nthe oath of Cæsar, that he should be preserved upon condition that he\r\nshould deliver to him certain of the precious things that had been\r\ndeposited in the Temple, came out of it and delivered him from the wall\r\nof the holy house two candlesticks, like to those that lay in the holy\r\nhouse, with tables, and cisterns, and vials, all made of solid gold and\r\nvery heavy. He also delivered to him the veils and the garments, with\r\nthe precious stones, and a great number of other precious vessels that\r\nbelonged to their sacred worship.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer of the Temple also, whose name was Phineas, was seized on,\r\nand showed Titus the coats and girdles of the priests, with a great\r\nquantity of purple and scarlet, which were there deposited for the uses\r\nof the veil, as also a great deal of cinnamon and cassia, with a large\r\nquantity of other sweet spices, which used to be mixed together and\r\noffered as incense to God every day. A great many other treasures were\r\nalso delivered to him, with sacred ornaments of the Temple not a few,\r\nwhich things thus delivered to Titus obtained of him for this man the\r\nsame pardon that he had allowed to such as deserted of their own accord.\r\n\r\nAnd now were the banks finished on the seventh day of the month Gorpieus\r\n(Elul) in eighteen days' time, when the Romans brought their machines\r\nagainst the wall. But for the seditious, some of them, as despairing of\r\nsaving the city, retired from the wall to the citadel. Others of them\r\nwent down into the subterranean vaults, though still a great many of\r\nthem defended themselves against those that brought the engines for the\r\nbattery; yet did the Romans overcome them by their number and by their\r\nstrength; and, what was the principal thing of all, by going cheerfully\r\nabout their work, while the Jews were quite dejected and become weak.\r\nNow as soon as a part of the wall was battered down, and certain of the\r\ntowers yielded to the impression of the battering rams, those that\r\nopposed themselves fled away, and such a terror fell upon the tyrants as\r\nwas much greater than the occasion required, for before the enemy got\r\nover the breach they were quite stunned, and were immediately for flying\r\naway. And now one might see these men, who had hitherto been so insolent\r\nand arrogant in their wicked practices, to be cast down and to tremble,\r\ninsomuch that it would pity one's heart to observe the change that was\r\nmade in those vile persons.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they ran with great violence upon the Roman wall that\r\nencompassed them, in order to force away those that guarded it, and to\r\nbreak through it and get away. But when they saw that those who had\r\nformerly been faithful to them had gone away--as indeed they were fled\r\nwhithersoever the great distress they were in persuaded them to flee--as\r\nalso when those that came running before the rest told them that the\r\nwestern wall was entirely overthrown, while others said the Romans were\r\ngotten in, and others that they were near and looking out for them,\r\nwhich were only the dictates of their fear, which imposed upon their\r\nsight, they fell upon their face and greatly lamented their own mad\r\nconduct; and their nerves were so terribly loosed that they could not\r\nflee away. And here one may chiefly reflect on the power of God\r\nexercised upon these wicked wretches, and on the good fortune of the\r\nRomans, for these tyrants did now wholly deprive themselves of the\r\nsecurity they had in their own power, and came down from those very\r\ntowers of their own accord, wherein they could have never been taken by\r\nforce, nor indeed by any other way than by famine. And thus did the\r\nRomans, when they had taken such great pains about weaker walls, get by\r\ngood fortune what they could never have gotten by their engines, for\r\nthree of these towers were too strong for all mechanical engines\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nSo they now left these towers of themselves, or rather they were ejected\r\nout of them by God himself, and fled immediately to that valley which\r\nwas under Siloam, where they again recovered themselves out of the dread\r\nthey were in for a while, and ran violently against that part of the\r\nRoman wall which lay on that side; but as their courage was too much\r\ndepressed to make their attacks with sufficient force, and their power\r\nwas now broken with fear and affliction, they were repulsed by the\r\nguards, and dispersing themselves at distances from each other, went\r\ndown into the subterranean caverns.\r\n\r\nSo the Romans being now become masters of the walls, they both placed\r\ntheir ensigns upon the towers and made joyful acclamations for the\r\nvictory they had gained, as having found the end of this war much\r\nlighter than its beginning, for when they had gotten upon the last wall,\r\nwithout any bloodshed, they could hardly believe what they found to be\r\ntrue; but seeing nobody to oppose them, they stood in doubt what such an\r\nunusual solitude could mean. But when they went in numbers into the\r\nlanes of the city with their swords drawn they slew those whom they\r\novertook without mercy, and set fire to the houses whither the Jews were\r\nfled, and burned every soul in them, and laid waste a great many of the\r\nrest; and when they were come to the houses to plunder them they found\r\nin them entire families of dead men; and the upper rooms full of\r\ncorpses, that is, of such as died by the famine. They stood in horror at\r\nthis sight, and went out without touching anything.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had this commiseration for such as were destroyed in that\r\nmanner, yet had they not the same for those that were still alive, but\r\nthey ran every one through whom they met, and obstructed the very lanes\r\nwith their dead bodies, and made the whole city run with blood, to such\r\na degree indeed that the fire of many of the houses was quenched with\r\nthese men's blood. And truly so it happened, that though the slayers\r\nleft off at the evening, yet did the fire greatly prevail in the night;\r\nand as all was burning, came that eighth day of the month Gorpieus\r\n[Elul] upon Jerusalem, a city that had been liable to so many miseries\r\nduring this siege, that, had it always enjoyed as much happiness from\r\nits first foundation, it would certainly have been the envy of the\r\nworld. Nor did it on any other account so much deserve these sore\r\nmisfortunes as by producing such a generation of men as were the\r\noccasion of this its overthrow.\r\n\r\nNow when Titus was come into this (upper) city, he admired not only some\r\nother places of strength in it, but particularly those strong towers\r\nwhich the tyrants in their mad conduct had relinquished, for when he saw\r\ntheir solid altitude, and the largeness of their several stones, and the\r\nexactness of their joints, as also how great was their breadth and how\r\nextensive their length, he expressed himself after the manner following:\r\n\"We have certainly had God for our assistant in this war, and it was no\r\nother than God who ejected the Jews out of these fortifications, for\r\nwhat could the hands of men or any machines do toward overthrowing these\r\ntowers?\" At which time he had many such discourses to his friends; he\r\nalso let such go free as had been bound by the tyrants, and were left in\r\nthe prisons. To conclude, when he entirely demolished the rest of the\r\ncity and overthrew its walls, he left these towers as a monument of his\r\ngood fortune, which had proved his auxiliaries, and enabled him to take\r\nwhat could not otherwise have been taken by him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, since his soldiers were already quite tired with killing men,\r\nand yet there appeared to be a vast multitude still remaining alive,\r\nCæsar gave orders that they should kill none but those that were in arms\r\nand opposed them, but should take the rest alive. But, together with\r\nthose whom they had orders to slay, they slew the aged and the infirm;\r\nbut for those that were in their flourishing age and who might be\r\nuseful to them they drove them together into the Temple and shut them up\r\nwithin the walls of the court of the women, over which Cæsar set one of\r\nhis freedmen, as also Fronto, one of his own friends, which last was to\r\ndetermine everyone's fate, according to his merits.\r\n\r\nSo this Fronto slew all those that had been seditious and robbers, who\r\nwere impeached one by another; but of the young men he chose out the\r\ntallest and most beautiful and reserved them for the triumph, and as for\r\nthe rest of the multitude that were above seventeen years old he put\r\nthem into bonds and sent them to the Egyptian mines. Titus also sent a\r\ngreat number into the provinces as a present to them, that they might be\r\ndestroyed upon their theatres by the sword and by the wild beasts; but\r\nthose that were under seventeen years of age were sold for slaves. Now\r\nduring the days wherein Fronto was distinguishing these men there\r\nperished, for want of food, eleven thousand, some of whom did not taste\r\nany food, through the hatred their guards bore to them, and others would\r\nnot take in any when it was given them. The multitude also was so very\r\ngreat that they were in want even of corn for their sustenance.\r\n\r\nNow the number of those that were carried captive during this whole war\r\nwas collected to be ninety-seven thousand; as was the number of those\r\nthat perished during the whole siege eleven hundred thousand, the\r\ngreater part of whom was indeed of the same nation [with the citizens of\r\nJerusalem], but not belonging to the city itself. They were come up from\r\nall the country to the feast of unleavened bread and were on a sudden\r\nshut up by an army, which, at the very first, occasioned so great a\r\nstraitness among them that there came a pestilential destruction upon\r\nthem, and soon afterward such a famine as destroyed them more suddenly.\r\n\r\nThat this city could contain so many people in it is manifest by that\r\nnumber of them which was taken under Cestius, who, being desirous of\r\ninforming Nero of the power of the city, who otherwise was disposed to\r\ncontemn that nation, entreated the high-priests, if the thing were\r\npossible, to take the number of their whole multitude. So these\r\nhigh-priests, upon the coming of that feast which is called the\r\nPassover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ninth hour till the\r\neleventh, but so that a company not less than ten belong to every\r\nsacrifice (for it is not lawful for them to feast singly by themselves),\r\nand many of them were twenty in a company, found the number of\r\nsacrifices was two hundred and fifty-six thousand five hundred, which,\r\nupon the allowance of no more than ten that feast together, amounts to\r\ntwo millions seven hundred thousand and two hundred persons that were\r\npure and holy; for as to those that have the leprosy, or the\r\ngonorrhoea, or women that have their monthly courses, or such as are\r\notherwise polluted, it is not lawful for them to be partakers of this\r\nsacrifice; nor indeed for any foreigners neither, who come hither to\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nNow this vast multitude is indeed collected out of remote places, but\r\nthe entire nation was now shut up by fate as in prison, and the Roman\r\narmy encompassed the city when it was crowded with inhabitants.\r\nAccordingly, the multitude of those that therein perished exceeded all\r\nthe destructions that either men or God ever brought upon the world;\r\nfor, to speak only of what was publicly known, the Romans slew some of\r\nthem, some they carried captives, and others they made a search for\r\nunderground, and when they found where they were they broke up the\r\nground and slew all they met with. There were also found slain there\r\nabove two thousand persons, partly by their own hands and partly by one\r\nanother, but chiefly destroyed by the famine; but then the ill-savor of\r\nthe dead bodies was most offensive to those that lighted upon them,\r\ninsomuch that some were obliged to get away immediately, while others\r\nwere so greedy of gain that they would go in among the dead bodies that\r\nlay on heaps and tread upon them, for a great deal of treasure was found\r\nin these caverns, and the hope of gain made every way of getting it to\r\nbe esteemed lawful.\r\n\r\nMany also of those that had been put in prison by the tyrants were now\r\nbrought out, for they did not leave off their barbarous cruelty at the\r\nvery last; yet did God avenge himself upon upon them both in a manner\r\nagreeable to justice. As for John, he wanted food, together with his\r\nbrethren, in these caverns, and begged that the Romans would now give\r\nhim their right hand for his security, which he had often proudly\r\nrejected before; but for Simon, he struggled hard with the distress he\r\nwas in, till he was forced to surrender himself. So he was reserved for\r\nthe triumph, and to be then slain, as was John condemned to perpetual\r\nimprisonment. And now the Romans set fire to the extreme parts of the\r\ncity, and burned them down, and entirely demolished its walls.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was Jerusalem taken, in the second year of the reign of\r\nVespasian, on the eighth day of the month Gorpieus (Elul). It had been\r\ntaken five times before, though this was the second time of its\r\ndesolation, for Shishak, the king of Egypt, and after him Antiochus, and\r\nafter him Pompey, and after them Sosius and Herod, took the city, but\r\nstill preserved it; but before all these the king of Babylon conquered\r\nit and made it desolate, one thousand four hundred and sixty-eight years\r\nand six months after it was built.\r\n\r\nBut he who first built it was a potent man among the Canaanites, and is\r\nin our own tongue called (Melchisedek), the righteous king, for such he\r\nreally was. On which account he was (there) the first priest of God, and\r\nfirst built a temple (there), and called the city Jerusalem, which was\r\nformerly called Salem. However, David, the king of the Jews, ejected the\r\nCanaanites, and settled his own people therein.\r\n\r\nIt was demolished entirely by the Babylonians, four hundred and\r\nseventy-seven years and six months after him. And from King David, who\r\nwas the first of the Jews who reigned therein, to this destruction under\r\nTitus, were one thousand one hundred and seventy-nine years; but from\r\nits first building till this last destruction were two thousand one\r\nhundred and seventy-seven years; yet hath not its great antiquity, nor\r\nits vast riches, nor the diffusion of its nation over all the habitable\r\nearth, nor the greatness of the veneration paid to it on a religious\r\naccount, been sufficient to preserve it from being destroyed. And thus\r\nended the siege of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Not to be confounded with John of Gischala, leader of one of the\r\nthree factions.\r\n\r\n[39] John of Gischala.\r\n\r\n[40] Probably that of John Hyrcanus I, a Maccabæan, prince of Judea,\r\nB.C. 135-105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF POMPEII\r\n\r\nA.D. 79\r\n\r\nPLINY             LYTTON\r\n\r\n     Among the historic calamities of the world none has gathered about\r\n     itself more of human interest, whether in connection with the study\r\n     of ancient cities and customs or in the calling forth of sympathy\r\n     through the magical treatment of imaginative literature, than the\r\n     destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum by the eruption of Mount\r\n     Vesuvius, which occurred at the beginning of the reign of Titus.\r\n     The eruption was accompanied by an earthquake, and the combination\r\n     of natural commotions caused the complete ruin and burial of the\r\n     two cities.\r\n\r\n     One of the most vivid descriptions of the catastrophe is that given\r\n     in the account of Dion Cassius. Among those who perished in the\r\n     disaster was the elder Pliny, the celebrated naturalist; and the\r\n     most famous narrative of the eruption is that here given of Pliny\r\n     the Younger, nephew of the other, in the two letters which he wrote\r\n     to Tacitus in order to supply that historian with accurate details.\r\n\r\n     Lytton's well-known _Last Days of Pompeii_, although a work of\r\n     imagination, deals with this subject in a manner which almost\r\n     simulates the realistic tale of an actual observer; and his\r\n     account, linking the calamity itself with the revelations of the\r\n     earlier explorers of the buried city, after so many centuries had\r\n     passed, well deserves a place in connection with the story of the\r\n     older and more circumstantial writer.\r\n\r\n     One of the earliest important discoveries at Pompeii, made in 1771,\r\n     was that of the \"Villa of Diomedes,\" named from the tomb of Marcus\r\n     Arrius Diomedes across the street. Since then every decade has seen\r\n     some progress in the work of excavation, and among other buildings\r\n     brought to light are the \"House of Pansa,\" the \"House of the Tragic\r\n     Poet,\" the \"House of Sallustius,\" the \"Castor and Pollux,\" a double\r\n     house, and the \"House of the Vettii\"--the last, a recent discovery,\r\n     being left with all its furnishings as found. Many interesting\r\n     objects have been discovered lately, and a complete picture can now\r\n     be presented of a small Italian city and its life in the first\r\n     century A.D. Valuable finds are wall paintings, illustrative of\r\n     decorative art; floor mosaics, etc., which may be seen in the Royal\r\n     Museum of Naples. Another of the most recent discoveries is that of\r\n     the temple of Venus Pompeiana in the southern corner of the city;\r\n     others are the remains of persons who, carrying valuables, perished\r\n     in a wayside inn where they had sought refuge. At the present time\r\n     about one-half of the city has been excavated, and the circuit of\r\n     the walls has been found to be about two miles. The uncovering of\r\n     the whole city will probably require many years. Excavations now\r\n     being made in the adjacent country promise results as interesting\r\n     as those already obtained within the city limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLINY\r\n\r\nYour request that I would send you an account of my uncle's death, in\r\norder to transmit a more exact relation of it to posterity, deserves my\r\nacknowledgments; for, if this accident shall be celebrated by your pen,\r\nthe glory of it, I am well assured, will be rendered forever\r\nillustrious. And notwithstanding he perished by a misfortune, which as\r\nit involved at the same time a most beautiful country in ruins, and\r\ndestroyed so many populous cities, seems to promise him an everlasting\r\nremembrance; notwithstanding he has himself composed many and lasting\r\nworks; yet I am persuaded, the mentioning of him in your immortal\r\nwritings will greatly contribute to render his name immortal.\r\n\r\nHappy I esteem those to be to whom by provision of the gods has been\r\ngranted the ability either to do such actions as are worthy of being\r\nrelated or to relate them in a manner worthy of being read; but\r\npeculiarly happy are they who are blessed with both these uncommon\r\ntalents: in the number of which my uncle, as his own writings and your\r\nhistory will evidently prove, may justly be ranked. It is with extreme\r\nwillingness, therefore, that I execute your commands; and should indeed\r\nhave claimed the task if you had not enjoined it. He was at that time\r\nwith the fleet under his command at Misenum.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him\r\nto observe a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size and shape. He\r\nhad just taken a turn in the sun,[41] and, after bathing himself in cold\r\nwater, and making a light luncheon, gone back to his books: he\r\nimmediately arose and went out upon a rising ground from whence he might\r\nget a better sight of this very uncommon appearance. A cloud, from which\r\nmountain was uncertain at this distance (but it was found afterward to\r\ncome from Mount Vesuvius[42]) was ascending, the appearance of which I\r\ncannot give you a more exact description of than by likening it to that\r\nof a pine tree, for it shot up to a great height in the form of a very\r\ntall trunk, which spread itself out at the top into a sort of branches;\r\noccasioned, I imagine, either by a sudden gust of air that impelled it,\r\nthe force of which decreased as it advanced upward, or the cloud itself,\r\nbeing pressed back again by its own weight, expanded in the manner I\r\nhave mentioned; it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and\r\nspotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth\r\nand cinders.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon seemed to a man of such learning and research as my\r\nuncle extraordinary and worth further looking into. He ordered a light\r\nvessel to be got ready, and gave me leave, if I liked, to accompany him.\r\nI said I had rather go on with my work; and it so happened he had\r\nhimself given me something to write out. As he was coming out of the\r\nhouse, he received a note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was in\r\nthe utmost alarm at the imminent danger which threatened her; for her\r\nvilla lying at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, there was no way of escape\r\nbut by sea; she earnestly entreated him therefore to come to her\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly changed his first intention, and what he had begun from a\r\nphilosophical, he now carried out in a noble and generous, spirit. He\r\nordered the galleys to put to sea, and went himself on board with an\r\nintention of assisting not only Rectina, but the several other towns\r\nwhich lay thickly strewn along that beautiful coast. Hastening then to\r\nthe place from whence others fled with the utmost terror, he steered his\r\ncourse direct to the point of danger, and with so much calmness and\r\npresence of mind as to be able to make and dictate his observations upon\r\nthe motion and all the phenomena of that dreadful scene. He was now so\r\nclose to the mountain that the cinders, which grew thicker and hotter\r\nthe nearer he approached, fell into the ships, together with\r\npumice-stones and black pieces of burning rock: they were in danger too\r\nnot only of being aground by the sudden retreat of the sea, but also\r\nfrom the vast fragments which rolled down from the mountain and\r\nobstructed all the shore. Here he stopped to consider whether he should\r\nturn back again; to which the pilot advising him, \"Fortune,\" said he,\r\n\"favors the brave; steer to where Pomponianus is.\" Pomponianus was then\r\nat Stabiæ, separated by a bay, which the sea, after several insensible\r\nwindings, forms with the shore. He had already sent his baggage on\r\nboard; for though he was not at that time in actual danger, yet being\r\nwithin sight of it, and indeed extremely near, if it should in the least\r\nincrease, he was determined to put to sea as soon as the wind, which was\r\nblowing dead in-shore, should go down. It was favorable, however, for\r\ncarrying my uncle to Pomponianus, whom he found in the greatest\r\nconsternation: he embraced him tenderly, encouraging and urging him to\r\nkeep up his spirits, and, the more effectually to soothe his fears by\r\nseeming unconcerned himself, ordered a bath to be got ready, and then,\r\nafter having bathed, sat down to supper with great cheerfulness, or at\r\nleast--what is just as heroic--with every appearance of it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile broad flames shone out in several places from Mount Vesuvius,\r\nwhich the darkness of the night contributed to render still brighter and\r\nclearer. But my uncle, in order to soothe the apprehensions of his\r\nfriend, assured him it was only the burning of the villages, which the\r\ncountry people had abandoned to the flames. After this he retired to\r\nrest, and it is most certain he was so little disquieted as to fall into\r\na sound sleep, for his breathing, which, on account of his corpulence,\r\nwas rather heavy and sonorous, was heard by the attendants outside.\r\n\r\nThe court which led to his apartment being now almost filled with stones\r\nand ashes, if he had continued there any time longer, it would have been\r\nimpossible for him to have made his way out. So he was awoke and got up,\r\nand went to Pomponianus and the rest of his company, who were feeling\r\ntoo anxious to think of going to bed. They consulted together whether it\r\nwould be most prudent to trust to the houses--which now rocked from side\r\nto side with frequent and violent concussions as though shaken from\r\ntheir very foundations--or fly to the open fields, where the calcined\r\nstones and cinders, though light indeed, yet fell in large showers and\r\nthreatened destruction. In this choice of dangers they resolved for the\r\nfields: a resolution which, while the rest of the company were hurried\r\ninto by their fears, my uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate\r\nconsideration. They went out then, having pillows tied upon their heads\r\nwith napkins; and this was their whole defence against the storm of\r\nstones that fell round them.\r\n\r\nIt was now day everywhere else, but _there_ a deeper darkness prevailed\r\nthan in the thickest night; which, however, was in some degree\r\nalleviated by torches and other lights of various kinds. They thought\r\nproper to go farther down upon the shore to see if they might safely put\r\nout to sea, but found the waves still running extremely high and\r\nboisterous. There my uncle, laying himself down upon a sail-cloth, which\r\nwas spread for him, called twice for some cold water, which he drank,\r\nwhen immediately the flames, preceded by a strong whiff of sulphur,\r\ndispersed the rest of the party, and obliged him to rise. He raised\r\nhimself up with the assistance of two of his servants, and instantly\r\nfell down dead; suffocated, as I conjecture, by some gross and noxious\r\nvapor, having always had a weak throat, which was often inflamed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light again, which was not till the third day after\r\nthis melancholy accident, his body was found entire, and without any\r\nmarks of violence upon it, in the dress in which he fell, and looking\r\nmore like a man asleep than dead. During all this time my mother and I,\r\nwho were at Misenum--but this has no connection with your history, and\r\nyou did not desire any particulars besides those of my uncle's death, so\r\nI will end here, only adding that I have faithfully related to you what\r\nI was either an eye-witness of myself or received immediately after the\r\naccident happened, and before there was time to vary the truth. You will\r\npick out of this narrative whatever is most important: for a letter is\r\none thing, a history another; it is one thing writing to a friend,\r\nanother thing writing to the public. Farewell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe letter which, in compliance with your request, I wrote to you\r\nconcerning the death of my uncle has raised, it seems, your curiosity\r\nto know what terrors and dangers attended me while I continued at\r\nMisenum; for there, I think, my account broke off:\r\n\r\n    \"Though my shock'd soul recoils, my tongue shall tell.\"\r\n\r\nMy uncle having left us, I spent such time as was left on my studies--it\r\nwas on their account indeed that I had stopped behind--till it was time\r\nfor my bath. After which I went to supper, and then fell into a short\r\nand uneasy sleep. There had been noticed for many days before, a\r\ntrembling of the earth, which did not alarm us much, as this is quite an\r\nordinary occurrence in Campania; but it was so particularly violent that\r\nnight that it not only shook but actually overturned, as it would seem,\r\neverything about us.\r\n\r\nMy mother rushed into my chamber, where she found me rising in order to\r\nawaken her. We sat down in the open court of the house, which occupied a\r\nsmall space between the buildings and the sea. As I was at that time but\r\neighteen years of age, I know not whether I should call my behavior, in\r\nthis dangerous juncture, courage or folly; but I took up Livy, and\r\namused myself with turning over that author, and even making extracts\r\nfrom him, as if I had been perfectly at my leisure. Just then, a friend\r\nof my uncle's, who had lately come to him from Spain, joined us, and\r\nobserving me sitting by my mother with a book in my hand, reproved her\r\nfor her calmness, and me at the same time for my careless security:\r\nnevertheless I went on with my author.\r\n\r\nThough it was now morning, the light was still exceedingly faint and\r\ndoubtful; the buildings all around us tottered, and though we stood upon\r\nopen ground, yet, as the place was narrow and confined, there was no\r\nremaining without imminent danger: we therefore resolved to quit the\r\ntown. A panic-stricken crowd followed us, and--as to a mind distracted\r\nwith terror every suggestion seems more prudent than its own--pressed on\r\nus in dense array to drive us forward as we came out. Being at a\r\nconvenient distance from the houses, we stood still, in the midst of a\r\nmost dangerous and dreadful scene.\r\n\r\nThe chariots, which we had ordered to be drawn out, were so agitated\r\nbackward and forward, though upon the most level ground, that we could\r\nnot keep them steady, even by supporting them with large stones. The sea\r\nseemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks by the\r\nconvulsive motion of the earth; it is certain at least the shore was\r\nconsiderably enlarged, and several sea animals were left upon it. On the\r\nother side, a black and dreadful cloud, broken with rapid, zig-zag\r\nflashes, revealed behind it variously shaped masses of flame: these last\r\nwere like sheet lightning, but much larger. Upon this our Spanish\r\nfriend, whom I mentioned above, addressing himself to my mother and me\r\nwith great energy and urgency: \"If your brother,\" he said, \"if your\r\nuncle be safe, he certainly wishes you may be so too; but if he\r\nperished, it was his desire, no doubt, that you might both survive him:\r\nwhy therefore do you delay your escape a moment?\"\r\n\r\nWe could never think of our own safety, we said, while we were uncertain\r\nof his. Upon this our friend left us, and withdrew from the danger with\r\nthe utmost precipitation. Soon afterward, the cloud began to descend and\r\ncover the sea. It had already surrounded and concealed the island of\r\nCapreæ[43] and the promontory of Misenum.\r\n\r\nMy mother now besought, urged, even commanded me to make my escape at\r\nany rate, which, as I was young, I might easily do; as for herself, she\r\nsaid, her age and corpulency rendered all attempts of that sort\r\nimpossible; however, she would willingly meet death if she could have\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing that she was not the occasion of mine. But I\r\nabsolutely refused to leave her, and, taking her by the hand, compelled\r\nher to go with me. She complied with great reluctance, and not without\r\nmany reproaches to herself for retarding my flight. The ashes now began\r\nto fall upon us, though in no great quantity. I looked back; a dense,\r\ndark mist seemed to be following us, spreading itself over the country\r\nlike a cloud. \"Let us turn out of the high-road,\" I said, \"while we can\r\nstill see, for fear that, should we fall in the road, we should be\r\npressed to death in the dark by the crowds that are following us.\"\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely sat down when night came upon us, not such as we have\r\nwhen the sky is cloudy, or when there is no moon, but that of a room\r\nwhen it is shut up and all the lights put out. You might hear the\r\nshrieks of women, the screams of children, and the shouts of men; some\r\ncalling for their children, others for their parents, others for their\r\nhusbands, and seeking to recognize each other by the voices that\r\nreplied; one lamenting his own fate, another that of his family; some\r\nwishing to die, from the very fear of dying; some lifting their hands to\r\nthe gods; but the greater part convinced that there were now no gods at\r\nall, and that the final endless night of which we have heard had come\r\nupon the world.[44] Among these there were some who augmented the real\r\nterrors by others imaginary or wilfully invented. I remember some who\r\ndeclared that one part of Misenum had fallen, that another was on fire;\r\nit was false, but they found people to believe them. It now grew rather\r\nlighter, which we imagined to be rather the forerunner of an approaching\r\nburst of flames--as in truth it was--than the return of day: however,\r\nthe fire fell at a distance from us: then again we were immersed in\r\nthick darkness, and a heavy shower of ashes rained upon us, which we\r\nwere obliged every now and then to stand up to shake off, otherwise we\r\nshould have been crushed and buried in the heap.\r\n\r\nI might boast that, during all this scene of horror, not a sigh or\r\nexpression of fear escaped me, had not my support been grounded in that\r\nmiserable, though mighty, consolation, that all mankind were involved in\r\nthe same calamity, and that I was perishing with the world itself. At\r\nlast this dreadful darkness was dissipated by degrees, like a cloud or\r\nsmoke; the real day returned, and even the sun shone out, though with a\r\nlurid light, like when an eclipse is coming on. Every object that\r\npresented itself to our eyes--which were extremely weakened--seemed\r\nchanged, being covered deep with ashes as if with snow.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Misenum, where we refreshed ourselves as well as we\r\ncould, and passed an anxious night between hope and fear; though,\r\nindeed, with a much larger share of the latter; for the earthquake still\r\ncontinued, while many frenzied persons ran up and down, heightening\r\ntheir own and their friends' calamities by terrible predictions.\r\nHowever, my mother and I, notwithstanding the danger we had passed and\r\nthat which still threatened us, had no thoughts of leaving the place\r\ntill we could receive some news of my uncle.\r\n\r\nAnd now you will read this narrative without any view of inserting it in\r\nyour history, of which it is not in the least worthy; and indeed you\r\nmust put it down to your own request if it should appear not worth even\r\nthe trouble of a letter. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON\r\n\r\nThe Amphitheatre at Pompeii was crowded to the doors. A lion was at\r\nlarge in the arena, and the populace surged toward an Egyptian priest,\r\nArbaces, demanding that he be thrown down to be devoured. As the mob\r\nrolled around him, intent on his death, Arbaces noted a strange and\r\nawful apparition. His craft made him courageous; he stretched forth his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Behold!\" he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the roar of\r\nthe crowd; \"behold how the gods protect the guiltless! The fires of the\r\navenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness of my accusers!\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld,\r\nwith ineffable dismay, a vast vapor shooting from the summit of\r\nVesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine tree; the trunk, blackness--the\r\nbranches, fire!--a fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with every\r\nmoment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that again\r\nblazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!\r\n\r\nThere was a dead, heart-sunken silence--through which there suddenly\r\nbroke the roar of the lion, which was echoed back from within the\r\nbuilding by the sharper and fiercer yells of its fellow-beast. Dread\r\nseers were they of the burden of the atmosphere, and wild prophets of\r\nthe wrath to come!\r\n\r\nThen there arose on high the universal shrieks of women; the men stared\r\nat each other, but were dumb. At that moment they felt the earth shake\r\nbeneath their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled, and beyond, in\r\nthe distance, they heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more and\r\nthe mountain-cloud seemed to roll toward them, dark and rapid, like a\r\ntorrent; at the same time it cast forth from its bosom a shower of ashes\r\nmixed with vast fragments of burning stone. Over the crushing\r\nvines--over the desolate streets--over the Amphitheatre itself--far and\r\nwide--with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea--fell that awful\r\nshower!\r\n\r\nNo longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces; safety for\r\nthemselves was their sole thought. Each turned to fly--each dashing,\r\npressing, crushing, against the other. Trampling recklessly over the\r\nfallen--amid groans and oaths and prayers and sudden shrieks, the\r\nenormous crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages.\r\nWhither should they fly? Some, anticipating a second earthquake,\r\nhastened to their homes to load themselves with their more costly goods,\r\nand escape while it was yet time; others, dreading the showers of ashes\r\nthat now fell fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, rushed under\r\nthe roofs of the nearest houses or temples or sheds--shelter of any\r\nkind--for protection from the terrors of the open air. But darker and\r\nlarger and mightier spread the cloud above them. It was a sudden and\r\nmore ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the streets were already thinned; the crowd had hastened to\r\ndisperse itself under shelter; the ashes began to fill up the lower\r\nparts of the town; but, here and there, you heard the steps of fugitives\r\ncranching them warily, or saw their pale and haggard faces by the blue\r\nglare of the lightning or the more unsteady glare of torches, by which\r\nthey endeavored to steer their steps. But ever and anon the boiling\r\nwater, or the straggling ashes, mysterious and gusty winds, rising and\r\ndying in a breath, extinguished these wandering lights, and with them\r\nthe last living hope of those who bore them.\r\n\r\nAmid the other horrors, the mighty mountain now cast up columns of\r\nboiling water. Blent and kneaded with the half-burning ashes, the\r\nstreams fell like seething mud over the streets in frequent intervals.\r\nAnd full, where the priests of Isis had now cowered around the altars,\r\non which they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense, one of\r\nthe fiercest of those deadly torrents, mingled with immense fragments\r\nof scoria, had poured its rage. Over the bended forms of the priests it\r\ndashed: that cry had been of death--that silence had been of eternity!\r\nThe ashes--the pitchy stream--sprinkled the altars, covered the\r\npavement, and half concealed the quivering corpses of the priests!\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the blackness gathered did the lightnings around\r\nVesuvius increase in their vivid and scorching glare. Nor was their\r\nhorrible beauty confined to the usual hues of fire; no rainbow ever\r\nrivalled their varying and prodigal dyes. Now brightly blue as the most\r\nazure depth of a southern sky--now of a livid and snakelike green,\r\ndarting restlessly to and fro as the folds of an enormous serpent--now\r\nof a lurid and intolerable crimson, gushing forth through the columns of\r\nsmoke, far and wide, and lighting up the whole city from arch to\r\narch--then suddenly dying into a sickly paleness, like the ghost of\r\ntheir own life!\r\n\r\nIn the pauses of the showers you heard the rumbling of the earth beneath\r\nand the groaning waves of the tortured sea; or, lower still, and audible\r\nbut to the watch of intensest fear, the grinding and hissing murmur of\r\nthe escaping gases through the chasms of the distant mountain. Sometimes\r\nthe cloud appeared to break from its solid mass, and, by the lightning,\r\nto assume quaint and vast mimicries of human or of monster shapes,\r\nstriding across the gloom, hurtling one upon the other, and vanishing\r\nswiftly into the turbulent abyss of shade; so that to the eyes and\r\nfancies of the affrighted wanderers the unsubstantial vapors were as the\r\nbodily forms of gigantic foes--the agents of terror and of death.\r\n\r\nThe ashes in many places were already knee-deep; and the boiling showers\r\nwhich came from the steaming breath of the volcano forced their way into\r\nthe houses, bearing with them a strong and suffocating vapor. In some\r\nplaces immense fragments of rock, hurled upon the house roofs, bore down\r\nalong the streets masses of confused ruin, which yet more and more, with\r\nevery hour, obstructed the way; and, as the day advanced, the motion of\r\nthe earth was more sensibly felt--the footing seemed to slide and\r\ncreep--nor could chariot or litter be kept steady, even on the most\r\nlevel ground.\r\n\r\nSometimes the huger stones, striking against each other as they fell,\r\nbroke into countless fragments, emitting sparks of fire, which caught\r\nwhatever was combustible within their reach; and along the plains beyond\r\nthe city the darkness was now terribly relieved, for several houses, and\r\neven vineyards, had been set on flames; and at various intervals the\r\nfires rose sullenly and fiercely against the solid gloom. To add to this\r\npartial relief of the darkness, the citizens had, here and there, in the\r\nmore public places, as the porticoes of temples and the entrances to the\r\nforum, endeavored to place rows of torches; but these rarely continued\r\nlong; the showers and the winds extinguished them, and the sudden\r\ndarkness into which their sudden birth was converted had something in it\r\ndoubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impotence of human hopes,\r\nthe lesson of despair.\r\n\r\nFrequently, by the momentary light of these torches, parties of\r\nfugitives encountered each other, some hurrying toward the sea, others\r\nflying from the sea back to the land; for the ocean had retreated\r\nrapidly from the shore--an utter darkness lay over it, and upon its\r\ngroaning and tossing waves the storm of cinders and rock fell without\r\nthe protection which the streets and roofs afforded to the land.\r\nWild--haggard--ghastly with supernatural fears, these groups encountered\r\neach other, but without the leisure to speak, to consult, to advise; for\r\nthe showers fell now frequently, though not continuously, extinguishing\r\nthe lights, which showed to each band the death-like faces of the other,\r\nand hurrying all to seek refuge beneath the nearest shelter.\r\n\r\nThe whole elements of civilization were broken up. Ever and anon, by the\r\nflickering lights, you saw the thief hastening by the most solemn\r\nauthorities of the law, laden with and fearfully chuckling over the\r\nproduce of his sudden gains. If, in the darkness, wife was separated\r\nfrom husband, or parent from child, vain was the hope of reunion. Each\r\nhurried blindly and confusedly on. Nothing in all the various and\r\ncomplicated machinery of social life was left save the primal law of\r\nself-preservation!\r\n\r\nIn parts, where the ashes lay dry and uncommixed with the boiling\r\ntorrents, cast upward from the mountain at capricious intervals, the\r\nsurface of the earth presented a leprous and ghastly white. In other\r\nplaces cinder and rock lay matted in heaps, from beneath which emerged\r\nthe half-hid limbs of some crushed and mangled fugitive.\r\n\r\nThe groans of the dying were broken by wild shrieks of women's\r\nterror--now near, now distant--which, when heard in the utter darkness,\r\nwere rendered doubly appalling by the crushing sense of helplessness and\r\nthe uncertainty of the perils around; and clear and distinct through all\r\nwere the mighty and various noises from the fatal mountain; its rushing\r\nwinds; its whirling torrents; and, from time to time, the burst and roar\r\nof some more fiery and fierce explosion. And ever as the winds swept\r\nhowling along the street, they bore sharp streams of burning dust, and\r\nsuch sickening and poisonous vapors as took away, for the instant,\r\nbreath and consciousness, followed by a rapid revulsion of the arrested\r\nblood, and a tingling sensation of agony trembling through every nerve\r\nand fibre of the frame.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all became lighted with an intense and lurid glow. Bright and\r\ngigantic through the darkness, which closed around it like the walls of\r\nhell, the mountain shone--a pile of fire! Its summit seemed riven in\r\ntwo; or rather, above its surface there seemed to rise two monster\r\nshapes, each confronting each, as demons contending for a world. These\r\nwere of one deep blood-red hue of fire, which lighted up the whole\r\natmosphere far and wide; but _below_, the nether part of the mountain\r\nwas still dark and shrouded, save in three places, adown which flowed,\r\nserpentine and irregular, rivers of molten lava. Darkly red through the\r\nprofound gloom of their banks they flowed slowly on, as toward the\r\ndevoted city. Over the broadest there seemed to spring a cragged and\r\nstupendous arch, from which, as from the jaws of hell, gushed the\r\nsources of the sudden Phlegethon. And through the still air was heard\r\nthe rattling of the fragments of rock, hurtling one upon another as they\r\nwere borne down the fiery cataracts--darkening, for one instant, the\r\nspot where they fell, and suffused the next, in the burnished hues of\r\nthe flood in which they floated!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNearly seventeen centuries had rolled away when the city of Pompeii was\r\ndisinterred from its silent tomb,[45] all vivid with undimmed hues; its\r\nwalls fresh as if painted yesterday--not a hue faded on the rich mosaic\r\nof its floors--in its forum the half-finished columns as left by the\r\nworkman's hand--in its gardens the sacrificial tripod--in its halls the\r\nchest of treasure--in its baths the _strigil_--in its theatres the\r\ncounter of admission--in its saloons the furniture and the lamp--in its\r\n_triclinia_ the fragments of the last feast--in its _cubicula_ the\r\nperfumes and the rouge of faded beauty--and everywhere the bones and\r\nskeletons of those who once moved the springs of that minute yet\r\ngorgeous machine of luxury and of life!\r\n\r\nIn the house of Diomed, in the subterranean vaults, twenty skeletons\r\n(one of a babe) were discovered in one spot by the door, covered by a\r\nfine ashen dust, that had evidently been wafted slowly through the\r\napertures, until it had filled the whole space. There were jewels and\r\ncoins, candelabra for unavailing light, and wine hardened in the\r\n_amphoræ_ for the prolongation of agonized life. The sand, consolidated\r\nby damps, had taken the forms of the skeletons as in a cast; and the\r\ntraveller may yet see the impression of a female neck and bosom of young\r\nand round proportions. It seems to the inquirer as if the air had been\r\ngradually changed into a sulphurous vapor; the inmates of the vaults had\r\nrushed to the door, to find it closed and blocked up by the scoria\r\nwithout, and, in their attempts to force it, had been suffocated with\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand, and near\r\nit a bag of coins. This is believed to have been the master of the\r\nhouse, who had probably sought to escape by the garden, and been\r\ndestroyed either by the vapors or some fragment of stone. Beside some\r\nsilver vases lay another skeleton, probably that of a slave.\r\n\r\nVarious theories as to the exact mode by which Pompeii was destroyed\r\nhave been invented by the ingenious; I have adopted that which is the\r\nmost generally received, and which, upon inspecting the strata, appears\r\nthe only one admissible by common sense; namely, a destruction by\r\nshowers of ashes and boiling water, mingled with frequent irruptions of\r\nlarge stones, and aided by partial convulsions of the earth.\r\nHerculaneum, on the contrary, appears to have received not only the\r\nshowers of ashes, but also inundations from molten lava; and the streams\r\nreferred to must be considered as destined for that city rather than for\r\nPompeii. Volcanic lightnings were evidently among the engines of ruin at\r\nPompeii. Papyrus, and other of the more inflammable materials, are found\r\nin a burned state. Some substances in metal are partially melted; and a\r\nbronze statue is completely shivered, as by lightning. Upon the\r\nwhole--excepting only the inevitable poetic license of shortening the\r\ntime which the destruction occupied--I believe my description of that\r\nawful event is very little assisted by invention, and will be found not\r\nthe less accurate for its appearance in a romance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] The Romans used to lie or walk naked in the sun, after anointing\r\ntheir bodies with oil, which was esteemed as greatly contributing to\r\nhealth, and therefore daily practised by them. This custom, however, of\r\nanointing themselves, is inveighed against by the satirists as in the\r\nnumber of their luxurious indulgences; but since we find the elder Pliny\r\nhere, and the amiable Spurinna in a former letter, practising this\r\nmethod, we cannot suppose the thing itself was esteemed unmanly, but\r\nonly when it was attended with some particular circumstances of an\r\nover-refined delicacy.\r\n\r\n[42] About six miles distant from Naples.\r\n\r\n[43] An island near Naples, now called Capri.\r\n\r\n[44] The Stoic and Epicurean philosophers held that the world was to be\r\ndestroyed by fire, and all things fall again into original chaos; not\r\nexcepting even the national gods themselves from the destruction of this\r\ngeneral conflagration.\r\n\r\n[45] Destroyed A.D. 79; first discovered A.D. 1750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS' LAST STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM: THEIR FINAL DISPERSION\r\n\r\nA.D. 132\r\n\r\nCHARLES MERIVALE\r\n\r\n     The successful revolt of the Maccabees against the bloody\r\n     persecutions of the Assyrian king Antiochus Epiphanes, about B.C.\r\n     164, inaugurated a glorious epoch in Jewish history. From that time\r\n     the Jews enjoyed their freedom under the dynasty of their\r\n     priest-kings till, B.C. 63, the Romans under Pompey took possession\r\n     of Jerusalem. A period of Roman tyranny and oppression followed. In\r\n     A.D. 66-70 a great revolt of the Jews occurred. The Romans burned\r\n     Jerusalem to the ground. Josephus says the number killed in this\r\n     revolt was one million one hundred thousand, and the number of\r\n     prisoners ninety-seven thousand. Of those who survived, \"all above\r\n     seventeen years old were sent to Egypt to work in the mines, or\r\n     distributed among the provinces to be exhibited as gladiators in\r\n     the public theatres and in the combats against wild beasts.\"\r\n\r\n     About fifty years later, A.D., 116, a tremendous uprising occurred\r\n     among the Jews of the eastern Mediterranean, in which many lives\r\n     were lost. It was quickly suppressed by the emperor Trajan, and the\r\n     punishments were similar in cruelty to those which followed the\r\n     previous insurrection.\r\n\r\n     But this dauntless people were not yet conquered. When the emperor\r\n     Hadrian, A.D., 130, arrived at Jerusalem on his tour of the empire,\r\n     he resolved that the holy city of the Jews should be rebuilt as a\r\n     Roman colony, and its name changed to Ælia Capitolina; and the Jews\r\n     were forbidden to sojourn in the new city. By this and other\r\n     measures the spark of revolt was once more kindled among the\r\n     religious and patriotic spirits of the Jewish nation. The Jews in\r\n     Palestine flew to arms, A.D., 132, encouraged by the prayers, the\r\n     vows, and the material support of their compatriots in Rome,\r\n     Byzantium, Alexandria, and Babylon. The Jewish war-cry echoed\r\n     around the civilized world.\r\n\r\n     A fitting leader for the insurrectionists soon appeared in the\r\n     person of Simon Barcochebas. Julius Severus, who was in Britain\r\n     ordering the affairs of that distant province, was summoned to the\r\n     East to quell the disturbance, which had swollen to the dimensions\r\n     of a revolution and threatened to abolish Roman authority in\r\n     Palestine. The conflict which ensued lasted from A.D. 132 to 135,\r\n     and was very bitterly contested on both sides. It was not before\r\n     the Hebrew leader fell amid thousands of his followers that the\r\n     Jewish forces were defeated. We are told that in this last\r\n     revolution the Romans took fifty fortresses, nine hundred and\r\n     eighty-five villages were occupied, and that the people killed\r\n     numbered five hundred and eighty thousand. The Jews were dispersed\r\n     to every quarter of the known world and remain so to this day. The\r\n     new city of Hadrian continued to exist, but did not prosper; and\r\n     the Jews were prohibited under penalty of death from ever setting\r\n     foot in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thread of imperial life could hardly snap without a jar which would\r\nbe felt throughout the whole extent of the empire. Trajan, like\r\nAlexander, had been cut off suddenly in the Far East, and, like\r\nAlexander, he had left no avowed successor. Several of his generals\r\nabroad might advance nearly equal claims to the sword of Trajan; some of\r\nthe senators at home might deem themselves not unworthy of the purple of\r\nNerva.\r\n\r\nOn every side there was an army or faction ready to devote itself to the\r\nservice of its favorite or its champion.\r\n\r\nThe provinces lately annexed were at the same time in a state of ominous\r\nagitation; along one half of the frontiers Britons, Germans, and\r\nSarmatians were mustering their forces for invasion; a virulent\r\ninsurrection was still glowing throughout a large portion of the empire.\r\nNevertheless, the compact body of the Roman Commonwealth was still held\r\nfirmly together by its inherent self-attraction. There was no tendency\r\nto split in pieces, as in the ill-cemented masses of the Macedonian\r\nconquest; and the presence of mind of a clever woman was well employed\r\nin effecting the peaceful transfer of power and relieving the State from\r\nthe stress of disruption.\r\n\r\nOf the accession of Publius Ælius Hadrianus, A.D., 117, to the empire;\r\nof the means by which it was effected; of the character and reputation\r\nhe brought with him to the throne; of the first measures of his reign,\r\nby which he renounced the latest conquests of his predecessor, while he\r\nput forth all his power to retain the realms bequeathed him from an\r\nearlier period--is matter for another story.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn to a review of eastern affairs; to the great Jewish\r\ninsurrection, and the important consequences which followed from it.\r\nTrajan was surely fortunate in the moment of his death. Vexed, as he\r\ndoubtless was, by the frustration of his grand designs for incorporating\r\nthe Parthian monarchy with the Roman, and fulfilling the idea of\r\nuniversal empire which had flitted through the mind of Pompius or\r\nJulius, but had been deliberately rejected by Augustus and Vespasian,\r\nhis proud spirit would have been broken indeed had he lived to witness\r\nthe difficulties in which Rome was plunged at his death, the spread of\r\nthe Jewish revolt in Asia and Palestine, the aggressions of the Moors,\r\nthe Scythians, and the Britons at the most distant points of his\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nThe momentary success of the insurgents of Cyprus and Cyrene had\r\nprompted a general assurance that the conquering race was no longer\r\ninvincible, and the last great triumphs of its legions were followed by\r\na rebound of fortune still more momentous.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the new reign was the formal relinquishment of the new\r\nprovinces beyond the Euphrates. The Parthian tottered back with feeble\r\nstep to his accustomed frontiers. Arabia was left unmolested; India was\r\nno longer menaced. Armenia found herself once more suspended between two\r\nrival empires, of which the one was too weak to seize, the other too\r\nweak to retain her.\r\n\r\nAll the forces of Rome in the East were now set free to complete the\r\nsuppression of the Jewish disturbances. The flames of insurrection which\r\nhad broken out in so many remote quarters were concentrated, and burned\r\nmore fiercely than ever in the ancient centre of the Jewish nationality.\r\n\r\nMartius Turbo, appointed to command in Palestine, was equally amazed at\r\nthe fanaticism and the numbers of people whose faith had been mocked,\r\nwhose hopes frustrated, whose young men had been decimated, whose old\r\nmen, women, and children had been enslaved and exiled. Under the\r\nteaching of the doctors of Tiberia faith had been cherished and hope had\r\nrevived. Despised and unmolested for fifty years, a new generation had\r\nrisen from the soil of their ancestors, recruited by the multitudes who\r\nflocked homeward, year by year, with an unextinguishable love of\r\ncountry, and reënforced by the fugitives from many scenes of\r\npersecution, all animated with a growing conviction that the last\r\nstruggle of their race was at hand, to be contested on the site of their\r\nold historic triumphs.\r\n\r\nIt is not perhaps wholly fanciful to imagine that the Jewish leaders,\r\nafter the fall of their city and Temple and the great dispersion of\r\ntheir people, deliberately invented new means for maintaining their\r\ncherished nationality. Their conquerors, as they might observe, were\r\nscattered like themselves over the face of the globe and abode wherever\r\nthey conquered; but the laws, the manners, and the traditions of Rome\r\nwere preserved almost intact amid alien races by the consciousness that\r\nthere existed a visible centre of their nation, the source, as it were,\r\nto which they might repair to draw the waters of political life. But the\r\ndispersions of the Jews seemed the more irremediable as the destruction\r\nof their central home was complete.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the existence of their nation one other way presented\r\nitself. In their sacred books they retained a common bond of law and\r\ndoctrine, such as no other people could boast. In these venerated\r\nrecords they possessed, whether on the Tiber or the Euphrates, an elixir\r\nof unrivalled virtue. With a sudden revulsion of feeling the popular\r\norators and captains betook themselves to the study of law, its history\r\nand antiquities, its actual text and its inner meaning. The schools of\r\nTiberias resounded with debate on the rival principles of\r\ninterpretation, the ancient and the modern, the stricter and the laxer,\r\nknown respectively by the names of their teachers, Schammai and Hillel.\r\n\r\nThe doctors decided in favor of the more accommodating system, by which\r\nthe stern exclusiveness of the original letter was extenuated, and the\r\nlaw of the rude tribes of Palestine moulded to the varied taste and\r\ntemper of a cosmopolitan society, while the text itself was embalmed in\r\nthe _Masora_, an elaborate system of punctuation and notation, to every\r\nparticle of which, to insure its uncorrupted preservation, a mystical\r\nsignificance was attached. By this curious contrivance the letter of the\r\nLaw, the charter of Judaism, was sanctified forever, while its spirit\r\nwas remodelled to the exigencies of the present or the future, till it\r\nwould have been no longer recognized by its authors, or even by very\r\nrecent disciples. To this new learning of traditions and glosses the\r\nardent youth of the nation devoted itself with a fanaticism not less\r\nvehement than that which had fought and bled half a century before. The\r\nname of the rabbi Akiba is preserved as a type of the hierophant of\r\nrestored Judaism.\r\n\r\nThe stories depicting him are best expounded as myths and figures. He\r\nreached, it was said, the age of a hundred and twenty years, the period\r\nassigned in the sacred records to his prototype, the law-giver Moses.\r\n\r\nLike David, in his youth he kept sheep on the mountains; like Jacob, he\r\nserved a master, a rich citizen of Jerusalem, for Jerusalem in his youth\r\nwas still standing. His master's daughter cast the eyes of affection\r\nupon him and offered him a secret marriage; but this damsel was no other\r\nthan Jerusalem itself, so often imaged to the mind of the Jewish people\r\nby the figure of a maiden, a wife, or a widow.\r\n\r\nThis mystic bride required him to repair to the schools, acquire\r\nknowledge and wisdom, surround himself with disciples; and such, as we\r\nhave seen, was the actual policy of the new defenders of Judaism.\r\n\r\nThe damsel was rebuked by her indignant father; but when, after the\r\nlapse of twelve years, Akiba returned to claim his bride, with twelve\r\nthousand scholars at his heels, he heard her replying that, long as he\r\nhad been absent, she only wished him to prolong his stay twice over, so\r\nas to double his knowledge; whereupon he returned patiently to his\r\nstudies, and frequented the schools twelve years longer. Twice twelve\r\nyears thus passed, he returned once more with twice twelve thousand\r\ndisciples, and then his wife received him joyfully, and, covered as she\r\nwas with rags, an outcast and a beggar, he presented her to his\r\nastonished followers as the being to whom he owed his wisdom, his fame,\r\nand his fortune.\r\n\r\nSuch were the legends with which the new learning was consecrated to the\r\ndefence of Jewish nationality.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of the Roman forces on the soil of Palestine seems to\r\nhave repressed for a season all overt attempts at insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish leaders restrained their followers from action as long as it\r\nwas possible to feed their spirit with hopes only. It was not till about\r\nthe fourteenth year of Hadrian's reign that the final revolt broke out.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jews of Palestine launched forth upon the war, the doctor\r\nAkiba gave place to the warrior Barcochebas. This gallant warrior, the\r\nlast of the national heroes, received or assumed his title, \"the Son of\r\nthe Star,\" given successively to several leaders of the Jewish people,\r\nin token of the fanatic expectations of divine deliverance by which his\r\ncountrymen did not yet cease to be animated. Many were the legends which\r\ndeclared this champion's claims to the leadership of the national cause.\r\nHis size and strength were vaunted as more than human. \"It was the arm\r\nof God, not of man,\" said Hadrian when he saw at last the corpse\r\nencircled by a serpent, \"that could alone strike down the giant.\" Flame\r\nand smoke were seen to issue from his lips in speaking, a portent which\r\nwas rationalized centuries later into a mere conjurer's artifice. The\r\nconcourse of the Jewish nation at his summons was symbolized, with a\r\ncurious reference to the prevalent idea of Israel as a school and the\r\nLaw as a master, by the story that at Bethar, the appointed rendezvous\r\nand last stronghold of the national defence, were four hundred\r\nacademies, each ruled by four hundred teachers, each teacher boasting a\r\nclass of four hundred pupils.\r\n\r\nAkiba, now at the extreme point of his protracted existence, like Samuel\r\nof old, nominated the new David to the chiefship of the people. He\r\ngirded Barcochebas with the sword of Jehovah, placed the staff of\r\ncommand in his hand, and held himself the stirrup by which he vaulted\r\ninto the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe last revolt of the Jewish people was precipitated apparently by the\r\nincreased severity of the measures which the rebellion under Trajan had\r\ndrawn down. They complained that Hadrian had enrolled himself as a\r\nproselyte of the Law, and were doubly incensed against him as a\r\npersecutor and a renegade.\r\n\r\nThis assertion, indeed, may have no foundation. On the other hand, it is\r\nnot unlikely that this prince, a curious explorer of religions of\r\nopinions, had sought initiation into some of the mysteries of the Jewish\r\nfaith and ritual.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, he gave them mortal offence by perceiving the\r\nclear distinction between Judaism and Christianity, and by forbidding\r\nthe Jews to sojourn in the town which he was again raising on the ruins\r\nof Jerusalem, while he allowed free access to their rivals. He is said\r\nto have even prohibited the rite of circumcision by which they jealously\r\nmaintained their separation from the nations of the West.\r\n\r\nAt last, when they rose in arms, he sent his best generals against them.\r\nTinnius Rufus was long baffled and often defeated; but Julius Severus,\r\nfollowing the tactics of Vespasian, constantly refused the battle they\r\noffered him, and reduced their strongholds in succession by superior\r\ndiscipline and resources. Barcochebas struggled with the obstinacy of\r\ndespair. Every excess of cruelty was committed on both sides, and it is\r\nwell, perhaps, that the details of this mortal spasm are almost wholly\r\nlost to us.\r\n\r\nThe later Christian writers, while they allude with unseemly exultation\r\nto the overthrow of one inveterate enemy by another who proved himself\r\nin the end not less inveterate, affirmed that the barbarities of the\r\nJewish leader were mainly directed against themselves.\r\n\r\nOn such interested assertions we shall place little reliance. In the\r\ncounter-narration of the Jews even the name of Christian is\r\ncontemptuously disregarded. It relates, however, how at the storming of\r\nBethar, when Barcochebas perished in the field, ten of the most learned\r\nof the rabbis were taken and put cruelly to death, while Akiba, reserved\r\nto expire last, and torn in pieces with hot pincers, continued to attest\r\nthe great principle of the Jewish doctrine, still exclaiming in his\r\ndeath throes, _Jehovah Erhad_! (\"God is one\").\r\n\r\nThe Jews who fell in these their latest combats are counted by hundreds\r\nof thousands, and we may conclude that the suppression of the revolt was\r\nfollowed by sanguinary proscriptions, by wholesale captivity and general\r\nbanishment. The dispersion of the unhappy race, particularly in the\r\nWest, was now complete and final. The sacred soil of Jerusalem was\r\noccupied by a Roman colony, which received the name of Ælia Capitolina,\r\nwith reference to the Emperor who founded it, and to the supreme God of\r\nthe pagan mythology, installed on the desecrated summits of Zion and\r\nMoriah.\r\n\r\nThe fane of Jupiter was erected on the site of the holy Temple, and a\r\nshrine of Venus planted, we are assured, on the very spot hallowed to\r\nChristians by our Lord's crucifixion. But Hadrian had no purpose of\r\ninsulting the disciples of Jesus, and this desecration, if the tradition\r\nbe true, was probably accidental. A Jewish legend affirms that the\r\nfigure of a swine was sculptured, in bitter mockery, over a gate of the\r\nnew city. The Jews have retorted with equal scorn that the effigy of the\r\nunclean animal, which represented to their minds every low and bestial\r\nappetite, was a fitting emblem of the colony and its founder, of the\r\nlewd worship of its gods, and the vile propensities of its Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe fancy of later Christian writers that Hadrian regarded their\r\ncoreligionists with special consideration seems founded on\r\nmisconception. We hear, indeed, of the graciousness with which he\r\nallowed them, among other sectarians, to defend their usages and expound\r\ntheir doctrines in his presence; and doubtless his curiosity, if no\r\nworthier feeling, was moved by the fact, which he fully appreciated, of\r\nthe interest they excited in certain quarters of the empire. But there\r\nis no evidence that his favor extended further than to the recognition\r\nof their independence of the Jews, from whom they now formally separated\r\nthemselves, and the discouragement of the local persecutions to which\r\nthey were occasionally subjected.\r\n\r\nSo far the bigoted hostility of their enemies was overruled at last in\r\ntheir favor.\r\n\r\nIn another way they learned to profit by the example of their rivals.\r\nFrom the recent policy of the Jews they might understand the advantage\r\nto a scattered community, without a local centre or a political status,\r\nof erecting in a volume of sacred records their acknowledged standard of\r\nfaith and practice.\r\n\r\nThe scriptures of the New Testament, like the _Nuschua_ of the Jewish\r\nrabbis, took the place of the holy of holies as the tabernacle of their\r\nGod and the pledge of their union with him.\r\n\r\nThe canon of their sacred books, however casual its apparent formation,\r\nwas indeed a providential development. The habitual references of\r\nbishops and doctors to the words of their Founder, and the writings of\r\nthe first disciples, guided them to the proper sources of their faith\r\nand taught them justly to discriminate the genuine from the spurious.\r\n\r\nMeagre as are the remains of Christian literature of the second century,\r\nthey tend to confirm our assurance that the scriptures of the new\r\ndispensation were known and recognized as divine at that early period,\r\nand that the Church of Christ, the future mistress of the world, was\r\nalready become a great social fact, an empire within the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTYRDOM OF POLYCARP AND JUSTIN MARTYR\r\n\r\nPOLYCARP'S EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS\r\n\r\nA.D. 155\r\n\r\nH. COX           POLYCARP\r\n\r\n     The Roman emperor Antoninus Pius, who died A.D. 161, had been\r\n     tolerant to the new Judaic sect known as Christians. Under his mild\r\n     _regime_, although he did not encourage them, the faithful had\r\n     greatly multiplied. The Christians had become a body great enough\r\n     to be reckoned with in a political sense. The populace were\r\n     generally hostile to them as \"enemies of the gods.\" More than one\r\n     of the apostolic fathers had suffered martyrdom, among them\r\n     Ignatius, a disciple of St. John and bishop of Antioch, who is said\r\n     to have been thrown to the lions in the Circus about A.D. 107. But\r\n     the account of the martyrdom of Polycarp is probably the first\r\n     authentic description we have.\r\n\r\n     Polycarp was born about A.D. 60, probably of Christian parents. He\r\n     bridges the little-known period between the age of his master, the\r\n     apostle John, and that of his own disciple, Irenæus. During the\r\n     earlier half of the second century he was bishop of Smyrna. Ephesus\r\n     had become the new hope of the faith, and in that city Polycarp had\r\n     received his education and \"lived in familiar intercourse with many\r\n     who had seen Christ.\" He was also intimate with Papias and\r\n     Ignatius. The only writing of Polycarp extant is the Epistle to the\r\n     Philippians, which follows. It is of great value for questions of\r\n     the canon, the origin of the Church, and the Ignatian epistles. Of\r\n     the authenticity of Polycarp's epistle Rev. Father W. O'B. Pardow,\r\n     S.J., says, \"There are long and learned controversies about some of\r\n     these [apocryphal] books.\" Of that in question he says: \"Probably\r\n     authentic; not inspired.\" Archbishop Wake was fully convinced of\r\n     its genuineness, and his translation has been here used.\r\n\r\n     Justin, surnamed \"the Martyr,\" was born at Sichen, Samaria, about\r\n     A.D. 100. After his conversion to Christianity he wandered about\r\n     arguing for the truth of the new faith. He was of a bold,\r\n     aggressive nature, and scorned to temporize in things spiritual.\r\n     His language and mode of address were borrowed from the Stoics, but\r\n     were the \"true utterance of his own manly soul. 'You can kill us;\r\n     you cannot harm us,'\" was his answer when condemned for being a\r\n     Christian. The words proceeded from a believer ready and destined\r\n     to give his life for the faith.\r\n\r\n     Truly did the blood of the martyrs prove the seed of the Church.\r\n     Polycarp's Epistle to the Philippians, hereto annexed, is taken\r\n     from a rare work which contains the uncanonical books of the period\r\n     of Christ's infancy and the early days of the Church, entitled _The\r\n     Apocryphal Books of the New Testament_. The laity have little\r\n     knowledge of it, but it is well known by the clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMERSHAM COX\r\n\r\nPolycarp, bishop of Smyrna, was undoubtedly a companion of the apostle\r\nJohn, and received instruction from other apostles. \"About this time,\"\r\nsays Eusebius, referring to the commencement of the second century,\r\n\"flourished Polycarp in Asia, an intimate disciple of the apostles, who\r\nreceived the episcopate of the Church of Smyrna at the hands of\r\neye-witnesses and servants of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe lengthened life of the apostle John, who attained to an extreme old\r\nage, connects the fathers of the second century with the immediate\r\nfollowers of Christ. Polycarp must have been a contemporary of St. John\r\nfor about twenty years.\r\n\r\nA letter of Irenæus, who was a pupil of Polycarp, has been preserved,\r\nwhich gives a graphic and remarkably interesting account of the familiar\r\nintercourse of Polycarp with the apostle. The letter is addressed by\r\nIrenæus to a friend named Florinus, with whom he remonstrates for\r\nholding erroneous doctrines:\r\n\r\n\"These doctrines, O Florinus, to say the least, are not of a sound\r\nunderstanding. These doctrines are inconsistent with the Church, and\r\ncalculated to thrust those that follow them into the greatest impiety;\r\nthese doctrines not even the heretics out of the Church ever attempted\r\nto assert; these doctrines were never delivered to thee by the\r\npresbyters before us, those who also were the immediate disciples of the\r\napostles.\r\n\r\n\"For I saw thee when I was yet a boy in Lower Asia with Polycarp moving\r\nin great splendor at court, and endeavoring by all means to gain his\r\nesteem. I remember the events of those times much better than those of\r\nmore recent occurrence, as the studies of our youth growing with our\r\nminds unite with them so firmly that I can tell also the very place\r\nwhere the blessed Polycarp was accustomed to sit and discourse, and also\r\nhis entrances, his walks, his manner of life, the form of his body, his\r\nconversations with the people and familiar intercourse with John, as he\r\nwas accustomed to tell, as also his familiarity with those that had\r\nseen the Lord; also concerning his miracles, his doctrine; all these\r\nwere told by Polycarp in consistency with the Holy Scriptures, and he\r\nhad received them from the eye-witnesses of the doctrine of salvation.\r\n\r\n\"These things, by the mercy of God and the opportunity then afforded me,\r\nI attentively heard, noting them down, not on paper, but in my heart;\r\nand these same facts I am always in the habit, by the grace of God, of\r\nrecalling faithfully to mind; and I can bear witness in the sight of God\r\nthat, if that blessed and apostolic presbyter had heard any such thing\r\nas this, he would have exclaimed and stopped his ears, and, according to\r\nhis custom, would have said: 'O good God! unto what things hast thou\r\nreserved me, that I should tolerate these things?' He would have fled\r\nfrom the place in which he had sat or stood hearing doctrines like\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\"From his epistles also, which he wrote to the neighboring churches in\r\norder to confirm them, or to some of the brethren in order to admonish\r\nor exhort them, the same thing may be clearly shown.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place Irenæus states that Polycarp was appointed bishop of\r\nSmyrna by the apostles themselves:\r\n\r\n\"Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with\r\nmany who had seen Christ, but was also by apostles in Asia appointed\r\nbishop of the Church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for\r\nhe lived a very long time; and when a very old man, gloriously and most\r\nnobly suffering martyrdom, departed this life, having always taught\r\nthose things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the\r\nChurch has handed down, and which alone are true.\"\r\n\r\nOf the numerous letters which Polycarp as bishop of Smyrna wrote to the\r\nneighboring churches only one is extant. It is addressed by \"Polycarp\r\nand the presbyters with him to the Church of God sojourning at\r\nPhilippi,\" and probably was written about the middle of the second\r\ncentury. In this epistle he praises the Philippians for their firm\r\nChristian faith, and exhorts them to adhere to the doctrine which St.\r\nPaul had taught them by word of mouth and by his epistle. After various\r\nexhortations to presbyters, deacons, and other members of the Church,\r\nPolycarp refers to the martyrdom of Ignatius, but apparently was\r\nignorant of the circumstances attending it, for the epistle concludes\r\nwith a request for information respecting him.\r\n\r\nThe martyrdom of Polycarp himself is described in an epistle addressed\r\nby the Church of Smyrna, of which he was bishop, to the Church of\r\nPhilomelium, a city of the neighboring province of Phrygia. There are\r\nprobably some interpolations; but, excepting these, the document can\r\nhardly be of much later date than the death of the martyr. There are\r\nseveral reasons for this conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the general tenor shows that it is intended to give\r\ninformation of events which had recently happened; secondly, a\r\npostscript states that a copy of it belonged to Irenæus, a disciple of\r\nPolycarp; and thirdly, a large part of it is transcribed by Eusebius,\r\nwho treats it as an authentic document.\r\n\r\nThe date of the death of Polycarp is well ascertained to be A.D. 167, in\r\nthe reign of Marcus Aurelius. For some time previously there had been a\r\ncruel persecution of the Christians at Smyrna, in which both the Gentile\r\nand Jewish inhabitants took part. Against Polycarp especially, as the\r\nchief minister of the Christian Church, their hostility was directed.\r\nAfter several Christians had been tortured and thrown to the lions, the\r\nmultitude clamored for the death of the bishop.\r\n\r\nYielding to the urgent entreaties of those around him Polycarp quitted\r\nthe city; but he was pursued and brought back. The proconsul, who had\r\nreluctantly allowed him to be arrested, was anxious to save him.\r\n\r\n\"When he was led forward, a great tumult arose among those that heard he\r\nwas taken. At length, as he advanced, the proconsul asked him whether he\r\nwas Polycarp, and, he answering that he was, he urged him to deny\r\nChrist, saying, 'Have a regard for your age,' and adding similar\r\nexpressions such as are usual for them to employ.\r\n\r\n\"'Swear,' he said, 'by the genius of Cæsar. Repent. Say, \"Away with\r\nthose that deny the gods.\"'\r\n\r\n\"But Polycarp, with a countenance grave and serious, and contemplating\r\nthe whole multitude that were collected in the stadium, beckoned with\r\nhis hand to them, and with a sigh looked up to heaven and said, 'Away\r\nwith the atheists.'\r\n\r\n\"The governor continued to urge him again, saying: 'Swear, and I will\r\ndismiss you. Revile Christ.'\r\n\r\n\"'Revile Christ!' Polycarp replied. 'Eighty-and-six years have I served\r\nhim and he never did me wrong; and how can I now blaspheme my King who\r\nhas saved me?'\"\r\n\r\nThe governor continued to urge him, and in vain threatened him with the\r\nwild beasts. At length a herald was ordered to proclaim in the midst of\r\nthe stadium that \"Polycarp confesses he is a Christian.\" Thereupon the\r\nmultitude cried out, \"This is that teacher of Asia, the father of the\r\nChristians, the destroyer of our gods,\" and demanded that he should be\r\nburned alive; and the governor gave sentence accordingly.\r\n\r\nAccording to the horrid custom of the times the executioners were about\r\nto fasten his hands to the stake by spikes, when he begged that he might\r\nbe bound merely, saying that He who gave him strength to bear the flames\r\nwould also give him strength to remain unmoved on the pyre.\r\n\r\nThis last request was granted; and being bound to the stake, he uttered\r\nthis beautiful prayer:\r\n\r\n\"Father of thy well-beloved and blessed Son, Jesus Christ, through whom\r\nwe have received the knowledge of thee, the God of angels and powers and\r\nall creation, and of all the family of the righteous that live before\r\nthee, I bless thee that thou hast thought me worthy of the present day\r\nand hour, to have a share in the number of the martyrs and in the cross\r\nof Christ unto the resurrection of eternal life, both of the soul and\r\nbody, in the incorruptible felicity of the Holy Spirit, among whom may I\r\nbe received in thy sight this day as a rich and acceptable sacrifice, as\r\nthou, the faithful and true God, hast prepared, hast revealed, and\r\nfulfilled. Wherefore, on this account and for all things, I praise thee,\r\nI bless thee, I glorify thee through the eternal High Priest, Jesus\r\nChrist, thy well-beloved Son, through whom glory be to thee with him in\r\nthe Holy Ghost, both now and evermore. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe flames did not immediately seize upon his body; so one of the\r\nexecutioners--in mercy perhaps--plunged a sword into his body, and so\r\nended his sufferings. The centurion then placed the body in the midst of\r\nthe fire and burned it, \"according to the custom of the Gentiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus at last, taking up his bones, valued more than precious stones,\r\nmore tried than gold, we deposited them where they should be. There\r\nalso, as far as we can, the Lord will grant us to celebrate the natal\r\nday of his martyrdom in joy and gladness, both in commemoration of those\r\nwho finished their contest before, and to prepare those that shall be\r\nhereafter.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something wonderfully touching in this reference to the \"natal\r\nday of his martyrdom.\" Those who wrote it thought that the day on which\r\nPolycarp was pierced by the sword was not the day of his death, but the\r\nbirthday of a new and happier life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJustin, who from the manner of his death is often called Justin Martyr,\r\nwas a native of Samaria. He was of Roman parentage, and was born early\r\nin the second century, and therefore must have been contemporary with\r\nmany persons who had seen some of the apostles.\r\n\r\nJustin, who was addicted to philosophical pursuits, has given in one of\r\nhis works a very curious account of his studies and search after\r\nreligious truth. First, he thought to find it in the Stoic philosophy:\r\n\r\n\"I surrendered myself to a certain Stoic, and, having spent a\r\nconsiderable time with him, when I had not acquired any further\r\nknowledge of God--for he did not know it himself, and said such\r\ninstruction was unnecessary--I left him and betook myself to another,\r\nwho was called a Peripatetic, and, as he fancied, shrewd. And this man,\r\nafter having entertained me for a few days, requested me to settle the\r\nfee, in order that our intercourse might not be unprofitable. Him, too,\r\nfor this reason I abandoned, believing him to be no philosopher at all.\"\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the mercenary spirit of the Peripatetic, the inquirer\r\nnext determined to make a trial of Pythagorean philosophy. But the\r\ncelebrated Pythagorean teacher whom he consulted wished him to learn\r\nmusic, astronomy, and geometry. Those kinds of knowledge, however, were\r\nnot what Justin wanted, and besides he thought that they would take up\r\ntoo much time. So he next resolved to make a trial of Platonism; and\r\nthis time he was more successful.\r\n\r\n\"In my helpless condition it occurred to me to have a meeting with the\r\nPlatonists, for their fame was great. I thereupon spent as much of my\r\ntime as possible with one who had lately settled in our city--a\r\nsagacious man holding a high position among the Platonists--and I\r\nprogressed and made the greatest improvements daily. And the perception\r\nof immaterial things quite overpowered me, and the contemplation of\r\nideas furnished my mind with wings, so that in a little while I supposed\r\nthat I had become wise; and such was my folly that I expected forthwith\r\nto look upon God, for this is the end of Plato's philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nJustin then proceeds to give a remarkably interesting and graphic\r\naccount of his conversion to Christianity:\r\n\r\n\"And while I was thus disposed, when I wished to be filled with great\r\nquietness and to shun the path of men, I used to go into a certain field\r\nnot far from the sea. And when I was near that spot one day where I\r\npurposed to be by myself, a certain old man of dignified appearance,\r\nexhibiting meek and venerable manners, followed me at a little distance.\r\nAnd when I turned around on him, having halted, I fixed my eyes rather\r\nkeenly upon him.\"\r\n\r\nJustin gets into conversation with the old man and says that he delights\r\nin solitary spots, where his attention is not distracted and where his\r\nconverse with himself is uninterrupted, and proceeds to a fervid\r\nlaudation of philosophy.\r\n\r\n\"'Does philosophy, then, make happiness?' said he, interrupting.\r\n'Assuredly,' said I, 'and it alone.' 'What, then, is philosophy?' he\r\nsaid, 'and what is happiness? Pray tell me, unless something hinders you\r\nfrom saying.'\r\n\r\n\"'Philosophy,' said I, 'is a knowledge of that which really exists and a\r\nclear perception of truth, and happiness is the reward of such knowledge\r\nand wisdom.' 'But what do you call God?' said he. 'That which always\r\nmaintains the same nature and is the cause of all other things--that,\r\nindeed, is God.' So I answered him, and he listened with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation, which is too long to be fully transcribed, turns on\r\nthe attributes of the soul. Justin discourses on that topic after the\r\nmanner of the Platonists. The old man, on the other hand, urges him to\r\nstudy the prophets of the Old Testament, for they predicted the coming\r\nof Christ, and their prophecies have been fulfilled. \"'They,' said he,\r\n'both glorified the Creator, the God and Father of all, and proclaimed\r\nhis Son the Christ sent by him. But,' he added, 'pray that, above all\r\nthings, the gates of light may be opened to you, for these things cannot\r\nbe perceived or understood by all, but only by him to whom God and his\r\nChrist have imparted wisdom.'\r\n\r\n\"When he had spoken these and many other things which there is no time\r\nfor mentioning at present, he went away, bidding me attend to them, and\r\nI have not seen him since. But straightway a flame was kindled in my\r\nsoul, and a love of the prophets and of those men who are friends of\r\nChrist possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind I found\r\nthis philosophy alone to be safe and profitable. Thus and for this\r\nreason I am a philosopher. Moreover, I would that all, making a\r\nresolution similar to my own, would regard the words of the Saviour, for\r\nthey possess a terrible power in themselves, and are sufficient to\r\ninspire those who turn aside from the path of rectitude with awe, while\r\nthe sweetest rest is afforded to those who diligently observe them.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Dialogue_ from which these passages are taken is a real or\r\nimaginary disputation with Trypho, a learned Jew at Ephesus, respecting\r\nthe principles of Christianity, and contains an elaborate demonstration\r\nthat Christ is the Messiah of the Old Testament. The controversy is\r\ncarried on with courtesy on both sides, and each disputant is equally\r\nearnest in his attempt to convert the other.\r\n\r\nJustin was a very copious writer. The two most important of his writings\r\nnow remaining are the two _Apologies_. These are certainly the two\r\nearliest of the numerous ancient pleas for toleration of Christianity\r\nnow extant. The first _Apologia_ is addressed to the emperor Antoninus\r\nPius and the Roman senate and the \"whole people of the Romans\"; and the\r\npurport of it may be inferred from the commencement, in which Justin\r\nsays that he presents this \"address and petition in behalf of all\r\nnations who are unjustly hated and wantonly abused, myself being one of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe second _Apologia_ was addressed to the Roman senate, probably in the\r\nreign of Antoninus Marcus Aurelius, and successor of Antoninus Pius. In\r\nthis work Justin appeals indignantly to the Roman senate against the\r\nunjust conduct of one Urbicus, who at Rome had condemned several persons\r\nto death simply because they professed to be Christians. This Urbicus\r\nseems to have held the office of prefect of the city--a magistrate from\r\nwhom there was no appeal except to the prince himself, or, as this\r\n_Apologia_ would suggest, to the senate.\r\n\r\nThe two _Apologies_ contain the most vehement invectives against the\r\nwhole system of heathen idolatry, and accuse Jupiter and the other gods\r\nwhom the Romans revered of ineffable vices.\r\n\r\nOf course the man who could thus tell the Roman senate and people that\r\nall that they held sacred was unspeakably and hideously wicked could\r\nexpect but one fate. Justin threw down the gauntlet, and the constituted\r\nauthorities very quietly took it up, with a result which, as the human\r\npower was all with them, it was not difficult to foresee.\r\n\r\nSome time in the reign of Aurelius, but in what year is not known,\r\nJustin and several other Christians were accused before Rusticus,\r\nprefect of Rome, of disobedience to certain decrees then in force, by\r\nwhich Christians who refused to sacrifice to the gods were liable to be\r\nput to death. It is difficult to reconcile the passing of these decrees\r\nwith the known character of Aurelius, who is universally described as a\r\nhumane, as a benevolent king. The probable explanation is that, like his\r\npredecessor Trajan, he was actuated by motives of state policy, and\r\nregarded Christianity as rebellion against the authority of the State.\r\n\r\nEusebius has given an account of the martyrdom of Justin upon the\r\nauthority of Tatian, who was a disciple of the martyr. This account\r\nsubstantially agrees with the very ancient _Martyrdom of Justin_, which\r\nconcludes thus:\r\n\r\n\"The prefect says to Justin: 'Hearken, you who are called learned and\r\nthink that you know true doctrines: if you are scourged and beheaded, do\r\nyou believe that you will ascend into heaven?'\r\n\r\n\"Justin said, 'I hope that if I endure these things I shall have this\r\ngift, for I know that to all who have thus lived there abides the divine\r\nfavor until the completion of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"Rusticus, the prefect, said, 'Do you suppose that you will ascend into\r\nheaven to receive such a recompense?' Justin said, 'I do not suppose it,\r\nbut I know and am fully persuaded of it.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus also said the other Christians, 'Do what you will, for we are\r\nChristians and do not sacrifice to idols.'\r\n\r\n\"Rusticus, the prefect, pronounced sentence, saying, 'Let those who have\r\nrefused to sacrifice to the gods and to yield to the command of the\r\nEmperor be scourged and led away to suffer decapitation according to the\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\n\"The holy martyrs, having glorified God and having gone forth to the\r\naccustomed place, were beheaded, and perfected their testimony in the\r\nconfession of the Saviour. And some of the faithful, having secretly\r\nremoved their bodies, laid them in a suitable place, the grace of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ having wrought along with them, to whom be glory\r\nforever and ever. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EPISTLE OF POLYCARP TO THE PHILIPPIANS\r\n\r\nPolycarp, and the presbyters that are with him, to the Church of God\r\nwhich is at Philippi: mercy unto you and peace from God Almighty and the\r\nLord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, be multiplied. I rejoiced greatly with\r\nyou in our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye received the images of a true\r\nlove, and accompanied, as it is behooved you, those who were in bonds,\r\nbecoming saints; which are the crowns of such as are truly chosen by God\r\nand our Lord: as also that the root of the faith which was preached from\r\nancient times remains firm in you to this day; and brings forth fruit to\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ, who suffered himself to be brought even to the\r\ndeath for our sins. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of\r\ndeath; whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him\r\nnot, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.\r\n\r\nInto which many desire to enter; knowing that by grace ye are saved; not\r\nby works, but by the will of God through Jesus Christ. Wherefore girding\r\nup the loins of your minds, serve the Lord with fear and in truth;\r\nlaying aside all empty and vain speech, and the error of many; believing\r\nin him that raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and hath\r\ngiven him glory and a throne at his right hand. To whom all things are\r\nmade subject, both that are in heaven and that are in earth; whom every\r\nliving creature shall worship; who shall come to be the judge of the\r\nquick and dead: whose blood God shall require of them that believe in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also raise up us in\r\nlike manner, if we do his will and walk according to his commandments;\r\nand love those things which he loved; abstaining from all\r\nunrighteousness, inordinate affection, and love of money; from evil\r\nspeaking; false witness; not rendering evil for evil, or railing for\r\nrailing, or striking for striking, or cursing for cursing. But\r\nremembering what the Lord has taught us, saying, Judge not, and ye shall\r\nnot be judged; forgive and ye shall be forgiven; be merciful, and ye\r\nshall obtain mercy; for with the same measure that ye mete withal, it\r\nshall be measured to you again. And again, that blessed are the poor and\r\nthey that are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for theirs is the\r\nkingdom of God.\r\n\r\nThese things, my brethren, I took not the liberty of myself to write\r\nunto you concerning righteousness, but you yourselves before encouraged\r\nme to it. For neither can I, nor any other such as I am, come up to the\r\nwisdom of the blessed and renowned Paul: who, being himself in person\r\nwith those who then lived, did with all exactness and soundness teach\r\nthe word of truth; and being gone from you wrote an epistle to you. Into\r\nwhich, if you look, you will be able to edify yourselves in the faith\r\nthat has been delivered unto you; which is the mother of us all; being\r\nfollowed with hope, and led on by a general love, both toward God and\r\ntoward Christ and toward our neighbor.\r\n\r\nFor if any man has these things he has fulfilled the law of\r\nrighteousness: for he that has charity is far from all sin. But the love\r\nof money is the root of all evil. Knowing therefore that as we brought\r\nnothing into this world, so neither may we carry anything out; let us\r\narm ourselves with the armor of righteousness. And teach ourselves first\r\nto walk according to the commandments of the Lord; and then your wives\r\nto walk likewise according to the faith that is given to them; in\r\ncharity, and in purity; loving their own husbands with all sincerity,\r\nand all others alike with all temperance; and to bring up their children\r\nin the instruction and fear of the Lord. The widows likewise teach that\r\nthey be sober as to what concerns the faith of the Lord: praying always\r\nfor all men; being far from all detraction, evil speaking, false\r\nwitness; from covetousness, and from all evil. Knowing that they are the\r\naltars of God, who sees all blemishes, and from whom nothing is hid; who\r\nsearches out the very reasonings, and thoughts, and secrets of our\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nKnowing, therefore, that God is not mocked, we ought to walk worthy both\r\nof his command and of his glory. Also the deacons must be blameless\r\nbefore him, as the ministers of God in Christ, and not of men. Not false\r\naccusers; not double-tongued; not lovers of money; but moderate in all\r\nthings, compassionate, careful; walking according to the truth of the\r\nLord, who was the servant of all. Whom if we please in this present\r\nworld we shall also be made partakers of that which is to come,\r\naccording as he has promised to us, that he will raise us from the dead;\r\nand that if we shall walk worthy of him, we shall also reign together\r\nwith him, if we believe.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the younger men must be unblamable in all things; above\r\nall, taking care of their purity, and to restrain themselves from all\r\nevil. For it is good to be cut off from the lusts that are in the world,\r\nbecause every such lust warreth against the Spirit; and neither\r\nfornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\r\nshall inherit the kingdom of God; nor they who do such things as are\r\nfoolish and unreasonable. Wherefore ye must needs abstain from all these\r\nthings, being subject to the priests and deacons, as unto God and\r\nChrist. The virgins admonish to walk in a spotless and pure conscience.\r\nAnd let the elders be compassionate and merciful toward all; turning\r\nthem from their errors; seeking out those that are weak; not forgetting\r\nthe widows, the fatherless, and the poor; but always providing what is\r\ngood both in the sight of God and man. Abstaining from all wrath,\r\nrespect of persons, and unrighteous judgment; and especially being free\r\nfrom all covetousness. Not easy to believe anything against any; not\r\nsevere in judgment; knowing that we are all debtors in point of sin.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we pray to the Lord that he would forgive us, we ought\r\nalso to forgive others; for we are all in the sight of our Lord and God;\r\nand must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ; and shall every\r\none give an account of himself. Let us, therefore, serve him in fear,\r\nand with all reverence as both himself hath commanded, and as the\r\napostles who have preached the gospel unto us, and the prophets who have\r\nforetold the coming of our Lord have taught us. Being zealous of what is\r\ngood; abstaining from all offence, and from false brethren; and from\r\nthose who bear the name of Christ in hypocrisy; who deceive vain men.\r\n\r\nFor whosoever does not confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,\r\nhe is antichrist; and whoever does not confess his suffering upon the\r\ncross is from the devil. And whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord\r\nto his own lusts, and says that there shall neither be any resurrection,\r\nnor judgment, he is the first-born of Satan. Wherefore, leaving the\r\nvanity of many and their false doctrines, let us return to the word that\r\nwas delivered to us from the beginning. Watching unto prayer, and\r\npersevering in fasting. With supplication beseeching the all-seeing God\r\nnot to lead us into temptation; as the Lord hath said, The spirit is\r\ntruly willing, but the flesh is weak. Let us, therefore, without ceasing\r\nhold steadfastly to him who is our hope, and the earnest of our\r\nrighteousness, even Jesus Christ; who his own self bare our sins in his\r\nown body on the tree; who did no sin, neither was guile found in his\r\nmouth. But suffered all for us that we might live through him. Let us,\r\ntherefore, imitate his patience; and if we suffer for his name, let us\r\nglorify him; for this example he has given us by himself, and so have we\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nWherefore I exhort all of you that ye obey the word of righteousness,\r\nand exercise all patience; which ye have seen set forth before our eyes,\r\nnot only in the blessed Ignatius and Zosimus and Rufus, but in others\r\namong ourselves; and in Paul himself, and the rest of the apostles.\r\nBeing confident of this, that all these have not run in vain, but in\r\nfaith and righteousness, and are gone to the place that was due to them\r\nfrom the Lord, with whom they also suffered; for they loved not this\r\npresent world, but him who died, and was raised again by God for us.\r\nStand, therefore, in these things and follow the example of the Lord;\r\nbeing firm and immutable in the faith, lovers of the brotherhood, lovers\r\nof one another, companions together in the truth, being kind and gentle\r\ntoward each other, despising none. When it is in your power to do good,\r\ndefer it not, for charity delivered from death. Be all of you subject\r\none to another, having your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that\r\nby your good works both ye yourselves may receive praise and the Lord\r\nmay not be blasphemed through you. But woe be to him by whom the name of\r\nthe Lord is blasphemed. Therefore teach all men sobriety; in which do ye\r\nalso exercise yourselves.\r\n\r\nI am greatly afflicted for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you;\r\nthat he should so little understand the place that was given to him in\r\nthe Church. Wherefore I admonish you that ye abstain from covetousness,\r\nand that ye be chaste, and true of speech. Keep yourselves from all\r\nevil; for he that in these things cannot govern himself, how shall he be\r\nable to prescribe them to another? If a man does not keep himself from\r\ncovetousness he shall be polluted with idolatry and be judged as if he\r\nwere a Gentile. But who of you are ignorant of the judgment of God? Do\r\nwe not know that the saints shall judge the world, as Paul teaches? But\r\nI have neither perceived nor heard anything of this kind in you, among\r\nwhom the blessed Paul labored, and who are named in the beginning of his\r\nepistle. For he glories of you in all the churches who then only knew\r\nGod; for we did not then know him. Wherefore, my brethren, I am\r\nexceedingly sorry both for him and for his wife; to whom God grant a\r\ntrue repentance.\r\n\r\nAnd be ye also moderate upon this occasion, and look not upon such as\r\nenemies, but call them back as suffering and erring members, that ye may\r\nsave your whole body; for by so doing ye shall edify your own selves.\r\nFor I trust that ye are well exercised in the Holy Scriptures, and that\r\nnothing is hid from you; but at present it is not granted unto me to\r\npractise that which is written, Be angry and sin not; and again, Let not\r\nthe sun go down upon your wrath. Blessed be he that believeth and\r\nremembereth these things, which also I trust you do.\r\n\r\nNow the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he himself who is\r\nour everlasting high-priest, the Son of God, even Jesus Christ, build\r\nyou up in faith and in truth and in all meekness and lenity; in\r\npatience and long-suffering, in forbearance and chastity. And grant unto\r\nyou a lot and portion among his saints; and us with you, and to all that\r\nare under the heavens, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nin his Father who raised him from the dead. Pray for all the saints;\r\npray also for kings, and all that are in authority; and for those who\r\npersecute you, and hate you, and for the enemies of the cross; that your\r\nfruit may be manifest in all, and that ye may be perfect in Christ. Ye\r\nwrote to me, both ye and also Ignatius, that if anyone went from hence\r\ninto Syria he should bring your letters with him, which also I will take\r\ncare of, as soon as I shall have a convenient opportunity, either by\r\nmyself or him whom I shall send upon your account. The Epistles of\r\nIgnatius, which he wrote unto us, together with what others of his have\r\ncome to our hands, we have sent to you, according to your order, which\r\nare subjoined to this epistle. By which we may be greatly profited; for\r\nthey treat of faith and patience, and of all things that pertain to\r\nedification in the Lord Jesus. What you know certainly of Ignatius and\r\nthose that are with him signify to us.\r\n\r\nThese things have I written unto you by Crescens, whom by this present\r\nepistle I have recommended to you, and do now again commend. For he has\r\nhad his conversation without blame among us, and I suppose also with\r\nyou. Ye will also have regard unto his sister when she shall come unto\r\nyou. Be ye safe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in favor with all yours.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION OF THE CHRISTIANS IN GAUL\r\n\r\nA.D. 177\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS P. G. GUIZOT\r\n\r\n     That the persecutions of Christians under the Roman Empire should\r\n     have been inaugurated by a Nero is not a subject of wonder in view\r\n     of that Emperor's character as depicted in history through all ages\r\n     since his own. But it is difficult to understand how an emperor\r\n     like Trajan--an enlightened and humane ruler--if he was powerless\r\n     to prevent, could have brought himself to give countenance to a\r\n     policy at once so intolerant and cruel, and in the end to prove so\r\n     short-sighted. A great cause prospers by persecution. The\r\n     martyr-spirit is strengthened by blows and fagots. History has well\r\n     proved the truth of that saying of the Church Fathers, tersely\r\n     given by St. Jerome: _Est sanguis martyrium seminarium Ecclesiarum_\r\n     (\"The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church\").\r\n\r\n     Still more incomprehensible to modern students is the fact that\r\n     Marcus Aurelius, the imperial philosopher and benevolent man,\r\n     should also be stained with the infamy of the persecutions. The\r\n     charges brought against him as a cruel persecutor of the Christians\r\n     have given rise to much dispute among historical scholars. Among\r\n     modern Christian writers of favorable disposition toward Marcus, F.\r\n     W. Farrar has perhaps as clearly as any set forth the views that\r\n     explain his conduct and vindicate his reputation for humanity:\r\n     \"That he shared the profound dislike with which Christians were\r\n     regarded is very probable. That he was a cold-blooded and virulent\r\n     persecutor is utterly unlike his whole character. The deep\r\n     calamities in which during his whole reign the empire was involved\r\n     caused widespread distress, and roused into peculiar fury the\r\n     feelings of the provincials against men whose atheism (for such\r\n     they considered it to be) had kindled the anger of the gods.\r\n     Marcus, when appealed to, simply let the existing law take its\r\n     course.\" In like manner the purely official or legal view of human\r\n     affairs often leads the most kindly and conscientious of men to\r\n     pursue or acquiesce in policies against which, in different\r\n     situations, their moral nature would rebel.\r\n\r\n     There were many reasons which led the populace to hate Christians,\r\n     whom, first of all, they regarded as being unpatriotic. While among\r\n     Romans it was considered the highest honor to possess the\r\n     privileges of Roman citizenship, the Christians announced that they\r\n     were citizens of heaven. They shrank from public office and\r\n     military service.\r\n\r\n     Again, the ancient religion of Rome was an adjunct of state dignity\r\n     and ceremonial. It was hallowed by a thousand traditional and\r\n     patriotic associations. The Christians regarded its rites and its\r\n     popular assemblies with contempt and abhorrence. The Romans viewed\r\n     the secret meetings of the Christians with suspicion, and accused\r\n     them of abominable excesses and crime. They were known to have\r\n     representatives in every important city of Gaul, Spain, Italy, and\r\n     Asia; and the more their communities grew, the more the Roman\r\n     populace raged against them. Only such considerations appear to\r\n     mitigate the historical judgments against Aurelius for marring the\r\n     splendor of his reign by persecutions. The tragedies enacted in the\r\n     churches of Lyons and Vienne, as described in the following pages,\r\n     form one of the most melancholy records of history.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Christianity began to penetrate into Gaul, it encountered there two\r\nreligions very different one from the other, and infinitely more\r\ndifferent from the Christian religion; these were Druidism and\r\npaganism--hostile one to the other, but with a hostility political only,\r\nand unconnected with those really religious questions that Christianity\r\nwas coming to raise.\r\n\r\nDruidism, considered as a religion, was a mass of confusion, wherein the\r\ninstinctive notions of the human race concerning the origin and destiny\r\nof the world and of mankind were mingled with the oriental dreams of\r\nmetempsychosis--that pretended transmigration, at successive periods, of\r\nimmortal souls into divers creatures. This confusion was worse\r\nconfounded by traditions borrowed from the mythologies of the East and\r\nthe North, by shadowy remnants of a symbolical worship paid to the\r\nmaterial forces of nature, and by barbaric practices, such as human\r\nsacrifices, in honor of the gods or of the dead.\r\n\r\nPeople who are without the scientific development of language and the\r\nart of writing do not attain to systematic and productive religious\r\ncreeds. There is nothing to show that, from the first appearance of the\r\nGauls in history to their struggle with victorious Rome, the religious\r\ninfluence of Druidism had caused any notable progress to be made in\r\nGallic manners and civilization. A general and strong, but vague and\r\nincoherent, belief in the immortality of the soul was its noblest\r\ncharacteristic. But with the religious elements, at the same time coarse\r\nand mystical, were united two facts of importance: the Druids formed a\r\nveritable ecclesiastical corporation, which had, throughout Gallic\r\nsociety, fixed attributes, special manners and customs, an existence at\r\nthe same time distinct and national; and in the wars with Rome this\r\ncorporation became the most faithful representatives and the most\r\npersistent defenders of Gallic independence and nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Druids were far more a clergy than Druidism was a religion; but it\r\nwas an organized and a patriotic clergy. It was especially on this\r\naccount that they exercised in Gaul an influence which was still\r\nexistent, particularly in Northwestern Gaul, at the time when\r\nChristianity reached the Gallic provinces of the South and Centre.\r\n\r\nThe Græco-Roman paganism was, at this time, far more powerful than\r\nDruidism in Gaul, and yet more lukewarm and destitute of all religious\r\nvitality. It was the religion of the conquerors and of the State, and\r\nwas invested, in that quality, with real power; but, beyond that, it had\r\nbut the power derived from popular customs and superstitions. As a\r\nreligious creed, the Latin paganism was at bottom empty, indifferent,\r\nand inclined to tolerate all religions in the State, provided only that\r\nthey, in their turn, were indifferent at any rate toward itself, and\r\nthat they did not come troubling the State, either by disobeying her\r\nrulers or by attacking her old deities, dead and buried beneath their\r\nown still standing altars.\r\n\r\nSuch were the two religions with which in Gaul nascent Christianity had\r\nto contend. Compared with them it was, to all appearance, very small and\r\nvery weak; but it was provided with the most efficient weapons for\r\nfighting and beating them, for it had exactly the moral forces which\r\nthey lacked. Christianity, instead of being, like Druidism, a religion\r\nexclusively national and hostile to all that was foreign, proclaimed a\r\nuniversal religion, free from all local and national partiality,\r\naddressing itself to all men in the name of the same God, and offering\r\nto all the same salvation. It is one of the strangest and most\r\nsignificant facts in history that the religion most universally _human_,\r\nmost dissociated from every consideration but that of the rights and\r\nwell-being of the human race in its entirety--that such a religion, be\r\nit repeated, should have come forth from the womb of the most exclusive,\r\nmost rigorously and obstinately national religion that ever appeared in\r\nthe world, that is, Judaism. Such, nevertheless, was the birth of\r\nChristianity; and this wonderful contrast between the essence and the\r\nearthly origin of Christianity was without doubt one of its most\r\npowerful attractions and most efficacious means of success.\r\n\r\nAgainst paganism Christianity was armed with moral forces not a whit\r\nless great. Confronting mythological traditions and poetical or\r\nphilosophical allegories, appeared a religion truly religious, concerned\r\nsolely with the relations of mankind to God and with their eternal\r\nfuture. To the pagan indifference of the Roman world the Christians\r\nopposed the profound conviction of their faith, and not only their\r\nfirmness in defending it against all powers and all dangers, but also\r\ntheir ardent passion for propagating it without any motive but the\r\nyearning to make their fellows share in its benefits and its hopes. They\r\nconfronted, nay, they welcomed martyrdom, at one time to maintain their\r\nown Christianity, at another to make others Christians around them;\r\npropagandism was for them a duty almost as imperative as fidelity.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not in memory of old and obsolete mythologies, but in the\r\nname of recent deeds and persons, in obedience to laws proceeding from\r\nGod, One and Universal, in fulfilment and continuation of a contemporary\r\nand superhuman history--that of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Son of\r\nMan--that the Christians of the first two centuries labored to convert\r\nto their faith the whole Roman world. Marcus Aurelius was contemptuously\r\nastonished at what he called the obstinacy of the Christians; he knew\r\nnot from what source these nameless heroes drew a strength superior to\r\nhis own, though he was at the same time emperor and sage. It is\r\nimpossible to assign with exactness the date of the first footprints and\r\nfirst labors of Christianity in Gaul. It was not, however, from Italy,\r\nnor in the Latin tongue and through Latin writers, but from the East and\r\nthrough the Greeks, that it first came and began to spread. Marseilles\r\nand the different Greek colonies, originally from Asia Minor and settled\r\nupon the shores of the Mediterranean or along the Rhone, mark the route\r\nand were the places whither the first Christian missionaries carried\r\ntheir teaching: on this point the letters of the apostles and the\r\nwritings of the first two generations of their disciples are clear and\r\nabiding proof.\r\n\r\nIn the West of the empire, especially in Italy, the Christians at their\r\nfirst appearance were confounded with the Jews, and comprehended under\r\nthe same name. \"The emperor Claudius,\" says Suetonius, \"drove from Rome\r\n(A.D. 52) the Jews who, at the instigation of Christus, were in\r\ncontinual commotion.\" After the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus (A.D.\r\n70), the Jews, Christian or not, dispersed throughout the empire; but\r\nthe Christians were not slow to signalize themselves by their religious\r\nfervor, and to come forward everywhere under their own true name.\r\n\r\nLyons became the chief centre of Christian preaching and association in\r\nGaul. As early as the first half of the second century there existed\r\nthere a Christian congregation, regularly organized as a church, and\r\nalready sufficiently important to be in intimate and frequent\r\ncommunication with the Christian churches of the East and West. There is\r\na tradition, generally admitted, that St. Pothinus, the first bishop of\r\nLyons, was sent thither from the East by the bishop of Smyrna, St.\r\nPolycarp, himself a disciple of St. John. One thing is certain, that the\r\nChristian Church of Lyons produced Gaul's first martyrs, among whom was\r\nthe bishop, St. Pothinus.\r\n\r\nIt was under Marcus Aurelius, the most philosophical and most\r\nconscientious of the emperors, that there was enacted for the first time\r\nin Gaul, against nascent Christianity, that scene of tyranny and\r\nbarbarity which was to be renewed so often and during so many centuries\r\nin the midst of Christendom itself. In the eastern provinces of the\r\nempire and in Italy the Christians had already been several times\r\npersecuted, now with cold-blooded cruelty, now with some slight\r\nhesitation and irresolution. Nero had caused them to be burned in the\r\nstreets of Rome, accusing them of the conflagration himself had kindled,\r\nand, a few months before his fall, St. Peter and St. Paul had undergone\r\nmartyrdom at Rome. Domitian had persecuted and put to death Christians\r\neven in his own family, and though invested with the honors of the\r\nconsulate.\r\n\r\nRighteous Trajan, when consulted by Pliny the Younger on the conduct he\r\nshould adopt in Bithynia toward the Christians, had answered: \"It is\r\nimpossible, in this sort of matter, to establish any certain general\r\nrule; there must be no quest set on foot against them, and no unsigned\r\nindictment must be accepted; but if they be accused and convicted, they\r\nmust be punished.\" To be punished, it sufficed that they were convicted\r\nof being Christians; and it was Trajan himself who condemned St.\r\nIgnatius, bishop of Antioch, to be brought to Rome and thrown to the\r\nbeasts, for the simple reason that he was highly Christian. Marcus\r\nAurelius, not only by virtue of his philosophical conscientiousness, but\r\nby reason of an incident in his history, seemed bound to be further than\r\nany other from persecuting the Christians.\r\n\r\nDuring one of his campaigns on the Danube, A.D. 174, his army was\r\nsuffering cruelly from fatigue and thirst; and at the very moment when\r\nthey were on the point of engaging in a great battle against the\r\nbarbarians, the rain fell in abundance, refreshed the Roman soldiers,\r\nand conduced to their victory. There was in the Roman army a legion, the\r\nTwelfth, called the _Melitine_ or the _Thundering_, which bore on its\r\nroll many Christian soldiers. They gave thanks for the rain and the\r\nvictory to the one omnipotent God who had heard their prayers, while the\r\npagans rendered like honor to Jupiter, the Rain-giver and the Thunderer.\r\nThe report about these Christians got spread abroad and gained credit in\r\nthe empire, so much so that there was attributed to Marcus Aurelius a\r\nletter, in which by reason, no doubt, of this incident, he forbade\r\npersecution of the Christians.\r\n\r\nTertullian, a contemporary witness, speaks of this letter in perfect\r\nconfidence; and the Christian writers of the following century did not\r\nhesitate to regard it as authentic. Nowadays, a strict examination of\r\nits existing text does not allow such a character to be attributed to\r\nit. At any rate the persecutions of the Christians were not forbidden,\r\nfor in the year 177, that is, only three years after the victory of\r\nMarcus Aurelius over the Germans, there took place, undoubtedly by his\r\norders, the persecution which caused at Lyons the first Gallic\r\nmartyrdom. This was the fourth, or, according to others, the fifth great\r\nimperial persecution of the Christians.\r\n\r\nMost tales of the martyrs were written long after the event, and came to\r\nbe nothing more than legends laden with details often utterly puerile or\r\ndevoid of proof. The martyrs of Lyons in the second century wrote, so\r\nto speak, their own history; for it was their comrades, eye-witnesses of\r\ntheir sufferings and their virtue, who gave an account of them in a long\r\nletter addressed to their friends in Asia Minor, and written with\r\npassionate sympathy and pious prolixity, but bearing all the\r\ncharacteristics of truth. It seems desirable to submit for perusal that\r\ndocument, which has been preserved almost entire in the _Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory_ of Eusebius, bishop of Cæsarea in the third century, and which\r\nwill exhibit, better than any modern representations, the state of facts\r\nand of souls in the midst of the imperial persecutions, and the mighty\r\nfaith, devotion, and courage with which the early Christians faced the\r\nmost cruel trials:\r\n\r\n\"The servants of Christ, dwelling at Vienne and Lyons in Gaul, to the\r\nbrethren settled in Asia and Phrygia, who have the same faith and hope\r\nof redemption that we have, peace, grace, and glory from God the Father\r\nand Jesus Christ our Lord!\r\n\r\n\"None can tell to you in speech or fully set forth to you in writing the\r\nweight of our misery, the madness and rage of the Gentiles against the\r\nsaints, and all that hath been suffered by the blessed martyrs. Our\r\nenemy doth rush upon us with all the fury of his powers, and already\r\ngiveth us a foretaste and the first-fruits of all the license with which\r\nhe doth intend to set upon us. He hath omitted nothing for the training\r\nof his agents against us, and he doth exercise them in a sort of\r\npreparatory work against the servants of the Lord. Not only are we\r\ndriven from the public buildings, from the baths, and from the Forum,\r\nbut it is forbidden to all our people to appear publicly in any place\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n\"The grace of God hath striven for us against the devil: at the same\r\ntime that it hath sustained the weak, it hath opposed to the Evil One,\r\nas it were, pillars of strength--men strong and valiant, ready to draw\r\non themselves all his attacks. They have had to bear all manner of\r\ninsult; they have deemed but a small matter that which others find hard\r\nand terrible; and they have thought only of going to Christ, proving by\r\ntheir example that the sufferings of this world are not worthy to be put\r\nin the balance with the glory which is to be manifested in us. They\r\nhave endured, in the first place, all the outrages that could be heaped\r\nupon them by the multitude, outcries, blows, thefts, spoliation,\r\nstoning, imprisonment, all that the fury of the people could devise\r\nagainst hated enemies. Then, dragged to the Forum by the military\r\ntribune and the magistrates of the city, they have been questioned\r\nbefore the people and cast into prison until the coming of the governor.\r\nHe, from the moment our people appeared before him, committed all manner\r\nof violence against them.\r\n\r\n\"Then stood forth one of our brethren, Vettius Epagathus, full of love\r\ntoward God and his neighbor, living a life so pure and strict that,\r\nyoung as he was, men held him to be the equal of the aged Zacharias. He\r\ncould not bear that judgment so unjust should go forth against us, and,\r\nmoved with indignation, he asked leave to defend his brethren, and to\r\nprove that there was in them no kind of irreligion or impiety. Those\r\npresent at the tribunal, among whom he was known and celebrated, cried\r\nout against him, and the governor himself, enraged at so just a demand,\r\nasked him no more than this question, 'Art thou a Christian?'\r\nStraightway with a loud voice he declared himself a Christian, and was\r\nplaced among the number of the martyrs.\r\n\r\n\"Afterward, the rest began to be examined and classed. The first, firm\r\nand well prepared, made hearty and solemn confession of their faith.\r\nOthers, ill prepared and with little firmness, showed that they lacked\r\nstrength for such a fight. About ten of them fell away, which caused us\r\nincredible pain and mourning. Their example broke down the courage of\r\nothers, who, not being yet in bonds, though they had already had much to\r\nsuffer, kept close to the martyrs, and withdrew not out of their sight.\r\nThen were we all stricken with dread for the issue of the trial: not\r\nthat we had great fear of the torments inflicted, but because,\r\nprophesying the result according to the degree of courage of the\r\naccused, we feared much falling away. They took, day by day, those of\r\nour brethren who were worthy to replace the weak; so that all the best\r\nof the two churches, those whose care and zeal had founded them, were\r\ntaken and confined.\r\n\r\n\"They took, likewise, some of our slaves, for the governor had ordered\r\nthat they should be all summoned to attend in public; and they, fearing\r\nthe torments they saw the saints undergo, and instigated by the\r\nsoldiers, accused us falsely of odious deeds, such as the banquet of\r\nThyestes, the incest of Oedipus, and other crimes which must not be\r\nnamed or even thought of, and which we cannot bring ourselves to believe\r\nthat men were ever guilty of. These reports having once spread among the\r\npeople, even those persons who had hitherto by reason, perhaps, of\r\nrelationship, shown moderation toward us, burst forth into bitter\r\nindignation against our people. Thus was fulfilled that which had been\r\nprophesied by the Lord: 'The time cometh when whosoever shall kill you\r\nshall think that he doeth God service.' Since that day the holy martyrs\r\nhave suffered tortures that no words can express.\r\n\r\n\"The fury of the multitude, of the governor, and of the soldiers fell\r\nchiefly upon Sanctus, a deacon of Vienne; upon Maturus, a neophyte\r\nstill, but already a valiant champion of Christ; upon Attalus also, born\r\nat Pergamus, but who hath ever been one of the pillars of our Church;\r\nupon Blandina, lastly, in whom Christ hath made it appear that persons\r\nwho seem vile and despised of men are just those whom God holds in the\r\nhighest honor by reason of the excellent love they bear him, which is\r\nmanifested in their firm virtue and not in vain show. All of us, and\r\neven Blandina's mistress here below, who fought valiantly with the other\r\nmartyrs, feared that this poor slave, so weak of body, would not be in a\r\ncondition to freely confess her faith; but she was sustained by such\r\nvigor of soul that the executioners, who from morn till eve put her to\r\nall manner of torture, failed in their efforts, and declared themselves\r\nbeaten, not knowing what further punishment to inflict, and marvelling\r\nthat she still lived, with her body pierced through and through, and\r\ntorn piecemeal by so many tortures, of which a single one should have\r\nsufficed to kill her. But that blessed saint, like a valiant athlete,\r\ntook fresh courage and strength from the confession of her faith; all\r\nfeeling of pain vanished, and ease returned to her at the mere utterance\r\nof the words, 'I am a Christian, and no evil is wrought among us.'\r\n\r\n\"As for Sanctus, the executioners hoped that in the midst of the\r\ntortures inflicted upon him--the most atrocious which man could\r\ndevise--they would hear him say something unseemly or unlawful; but so\r\nfirmly did he resist them, that, without even saying his name, or that\r\nof his nation or city, or whether he was bond or free, he only replied\r\nin the Roman tongue, to all questions, 'I am a Christian.' Therein was,\r\nfor him, his name, his country, his condition, his whole being; and\r\nnever could the Gentiles wrest from him another word. The fury of the\r\ngovernor and the executioners was redoubled against him; and, not\r\nknowing how to torment him further, they applied to his most tender\r\nmembers bars of red-hot iron. His members burned; but he, upright and\r\nimmovable, persisted in his profession of faith, as if living waters\r\nfrom the bosom of Christ flowed over him and refreshed him. Some days\r\nafter, these infidels began again to torture him, believing that if they\r\ninflicted upon his blistering wounds the same agonies, they would\r\ntriumph over him, who seemed unable to bear the mere touch of their\r\nhands; and they hoped, also, that the sight of his torturing alive would\r\nterrify his comrades. But, contrary to general expectation, the body of\r\nSanctus, rising suddenly up, stood erect and firm amid these repeated\r\ntorments, and recovered its old appearance and the use of its members,\r\nas if, by divine grace, this second laceration of his flesh had caused\r\nhealing rather than suffering.\r\n\r\n\"When the tyrants had thus expended and exhausted their tortures against\r\nthe firmness of the martyrs sustained by Christ, the devil devised other\r\ncontrivances. They were cast into the darkest and most unendurable place\r\nin their prison; their feet were dragged out and compressed to the\r\nutmost tension of the muscles; the jailers, as if instigated by a demon,\r\ntried every sort of torture, insomuch that several of them, for whom God\r\nwilled such an end, died of suffocation in prison. Others, who had been\r\ntortured in such a manner that it was thought impossible they should\r\nlong survive, deprived as they were of every remedy and aid from men,\r\nbut supported nevertheless by the grace of God, remained sound and\r\nstrong in body as in soul, and comforted and reanimated their brethren.\r\n\r\n\"The blessed Pothinus, who held at that time the bishopric of Lyons,\r\nbeing upward of ninety, and so weak in body that he could hardly\r\nbreathe, was himself brought before the tribunal, so worn with old age\r\nand sickness that he seemed nigh to extinction; but he still possessed\r\nhis soul, wherewith to subserve the triumph of Christ. Being brought by\r\nthe soldiers before the tribunal, whither he was accompanied by all the\r\nmagistrates of the city and the whole populace, that pursued him with\r\nhootings, he offered, as if he had been the very Christ, the most\r\nglorious testimony. At a question from the governor, who asked what the\r\nGod of the Christians was, he answered, 'If thou be worthy, thou shalt\r\nknow.' He was immediately raised up, without any respect or humanity,\r\nand blows were showered upon him; those who happened to be nearest to\r\nhim assaulted him grievously with foot and fist, without the slightest\r\nregard for his age; those who were farther off cast at him whatever was\r\nto their hand; they would all have thought themselves guilty of the\r\ngreatest default if they had not done their best, each on his own score,\r\nto insult him brutally. They believed they were avenging the wrongs of\r\ntheir gods. Pothinus, still breathing, was cast again into prison, and\r\ntwo days after yielded up his spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Then were manifested a singular dispensation of God and the\r\nimmeasurable compassion of Jesus Christ: an example rare among brethren,\r\nbut in accord with the intentions and the justice of the Lord. All those\r\nwho, at their first arrest, had denied their faith, were themselves cast\r\ninto prison and given over to the same sufferings as the other martyrs,\r\nfor their denial did not serve them at all. Those who had made\r\nprofession of being what they really were--that is, Christians--were\r\nimprisoned without being accused of other crimes. The former, on the\r\ncontrary, were confined as homicides and wretches, thus suffering double\r\npunishment. The one sort found repose in the honorable joys of\r\nmartyrdom, in the hope of promised blessedness, in the love of Christ,\r\nand in the spirit of God the Father; the other were a prey to the\r\nreproaches of conscience. It was easy to distinguish the one from the\r\nother by their looks. The one walked joyously, bearing on their faces a\r\nmajesty mingled with sweetness, and their very bonds seemed unto them an\r\nornament, even as the broidery that decks a bride; the other, with\r\ndowncast eyes and humble and dejected air, were an object of contempt to\r\nthe Gentiles themselves, who regarded them as cowards who had forfeited\r\nthe glorious and saving name of Christians. And so they who were present\r\nat this double spectacle were thereby signally strengthened, and whoever\r\namong them chanced to be arrested confessed the faith without doubt or\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Things having come to this pass, different kinds of death were\r\ninflicted on the martyrs, and they offered to God a crown of divers\r\nflowers. It was but right that the most valiant champions, those who had\r\nsustained a double assault and gained a signal victory, should receive a\r\nsplendid crown of immortality. The neophyte Maturus and the deacon\r\nSanctus, Blandina and Attalus, then, were led into the amphitheatre, and\r\nthrown to the beasts, as a sight to please the inhumanity of the\r\nGentiles. Maturus and Sanctus there underwent all kinds of tortures, as\r\nif they had hitherto suffered nothing; or, rather, like athletes who had\r\nalready been several times victorious, and were contending for the crown\r\nof crowns, they braved the stripes with which they were beaten, the\r\nbites of the beasts that dragged them to and fro, and all that was\r\ndemanded by the outcries of an insensate mob, so much the more furious\r\nbecause it could by no means overcome the firmness of the martyrs or\r\nextort from Sanctus any other speech than that which, on the first day,\r\nhe had uttered--'I am a Christian.' After this fearful contest, as life\r\nwas not extinct, their throats were at last cut, when they alone had\r\nthus been offered as a spectacle to the public instead of the variety\r\ndisplayed in the combat of gladiators.\r\n\r\n\"Blandina, in her turn, tied to a stake, was given to the beasts; she\r\nwas seen hanging, as it were, on a sort of cross, calling upon God with\r\ntrustful fervor, and the brethren present were reminded, in the person\r\nof a sister, of Him who had been crucified for their salvation. As none\r\nof the beasts would touch the body of Blandina, she was released from\r\nthe stake, taken back to prison, and reserved for another occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Attalus, whose execution, seeing that he was a man of mark, was\r\nfuriously demanded by the people, came forward ready to brave\r\neverything, as a man deriving confidence from the memory of his life,\r\nfor he had courageously trained himself to discipline, and had always\r\namong us borne witness for the truth. He was led all round the\r\nAmphitheatre, preceded by a board bearing this inscription in Latin:\r\n'This is Attalus the Christian.' The people pursued him with the most\r\nfurious hootings; but the governor, having learned that he was a Roman\r\ncitizen, had him taken back to prison with the rest. Having subsequently\r\nwritten to Cæsar, he waited for his decision as to those who were thus\r\ndetained.\r\n\r\n\"This delay was neither useless nor unprofitable, for then shone forth\r\nthe boundless compassion of Christ. Those of the brethren who had been\r\nbut dead members of the Church were recalled to life by the pains and\r\nhelp of the living; the martyrs obtained grace for those who had fallen\r\naway; and great was the joy in the Church, at the same time virgin and\r\nmother, for she once more found living those whom she had given up for\r\ndead. Thus revived and strengthened by the goodness of God, who willeth\r\nnot the death of the sinner, but rather inviteth him to repentance, they\r\npresented themselves before the tribunal, to be questioned afresh by the\r\ngovernor. Cæsar had replied that they who confessed themselves to be\r\nChristians should be put to the sword, and they who denied sent away\r\nsafe and sound. When the time for the great market had fully come, there\r\nassembled a numerous multitude from every nation and every province. The\r\ngovernor had the blessed martyrs brought up before his judgment-seat,\r\nshowing them before the people with all the pomp of a theatre. He\r\nquestioned them afresh; and those who were discovered to be Roman\r\ncitizens were beheaded, the rest were thrown to the beasts.\r\n\r\n\"Great glory was gained for Christ by means of those who had at first\r\ndenied their faith, and who now confessed it contrary to the expectation\r\nof the Gentiles. Those who, having been privately questioned, declared\r\nthemselves Christians were added to the number of the martyrs. Those in\r\nwhom appeared no vestige of faith and no fear of God, remained without\r\nthe pale of the Church. When they were dealing with those who had been\r\nreunited to it, one Alexander, a Phrygian by nation, a physician by\r\nprofession, who had for many years been dwelling in Gaul, a man well\r\nknown to all for his love of God and open preaching of the faith, took\r\nhis place in the hall of judgment, exhorting by signs all who filled it\r\nto confess their faith, even as if he had been called in to deliver\r\nthem of it. The multitude, enraged to see that those who had at first\r\ndenied turned round and proclaimed their faith, cried out against\r\nAlexander, whom they accused of the conversion.\r\n\r\n\"The governor forthwith asked him what he was, and at the answer, 'I am\r\na Christian,' condemned him to the beasts. On the morrow Alexander was\r\nagain brought up, together with Attalus, whom the governor, to please\r\nthe people, had once more condemned to the beasts. After they had both\r\nsuffered in the Amphitheatre all the torments that could be devised,\r\nthey were put to the sword. Alexander uttered not a complaint, not a\r\nword; he had the air of one who was talking inwardly with God. Attalus,\r\nseated on an iron seat, and waiting for the fire to consume his body,\r\nsaid, in Latin, to the people: 'See what ye are doing; it is in truth\r\ndevouring men; as for us, we devour not men, and we do no evil at all.'\r\nHe was asked what was the name of God: 'God,' said he, 'is not like us\r\nmortals; he hath no name.'\r\n\r\n\"After all these martyrs, on the last day of the shows, Blandina was\r\nagain brought up, together with a young lad, named Ponticus, about\r\nfifteen years old. They had been brought up every day before that they\r\nmight see the tortures of their brethren. When they were called upon to\r\nswear by the altars of the Gentiles, they remained firm in their faith,\r\nmaking no account of those pretended gods, and so great was the fury of\r\nthe multitude against them that no pity was shown for the age of the\r\nchild or the sex of the woman. Tortures were heaped upon them; they were\r\nmade to pass through every kind of torment, but the desired end was not\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n\"Supported by the exhortations of his sister, who was seen and heard by\r\nthe Gentiles, Ponticus, after having endured all magnanimously, gave up\r\nthe ghost. Blandina, last of all--like a noble mother that hath roused\r\nthe courage of her sons for the fight, and sent them forth to conquer\r\nfor their king--passed once more through all the tortures they had\r\nsuffered, anxious to go and rejoin them, and rejoicing at each step\r\ntoward death. At length, after she had undergone fire, the talons of\r\nbeasts, and agonizing aspersion, she was wrapped in a network and thrown\r\nto a bull that tossed her in the air; she was already unconscious of\r\nall that befell her, and seemed altogether taken up with watching for\r\nthe blessings that Christ had in store for her. Even the Gentiles\r\nallowed that never a woman had suffered so much or so long.\r\n\r\n\"Still their fury and their cruelty toward the saints were not appeased.\r\nThey devised another way of raging against them; they cast to the dogs\r\nthe bodies of those who had died of suffocation in prison, and watched\r\nnight and day that none of our brethren might come and bury them. As for\r\nwhat remained of the martyrs' half-mangled or devoured corpses, they\r\nleft them exposed under a guard of soldiers, coming to look on them with\r\ninsulting eyes, and saying: 'Where is now their God? Of what use to them\r\nwas this religion for which they laid down their lives?' We were\r\novercome with grief that we were not able to bury these poor corpses;\r\nnor the darkness of night, nor gold, nor prayers could help us to\r\nsucceed therein. After being thus exposed for six days in the open air,\r\ngiven over to all manner of outrage, the corpses of the martyrs were at\r\nlast burned, reduced to ashes, and cast hither and thither by the\r\ninfidels upon the waters of the Rhone, that there might be left no trace\r\nof them on earth. They acted as if they had been more mighty than God,\r\nand could rob our brethren of their resurrection: ''Tis in that hope,'\r\nsaid they, 'that these folk bring among us a new and strange religion,\r\nthat they set at naught the most painful torments, and that they go\r\njoyfully to face death: let us see if they will rise again, if their God\r\nwill come to their aid and will be able to tear them from our hands.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is not without a painful effort that, even after so many centuries,\r\nwe can resign ourselves to be witnesses, in imagination only, of such a\r\nspectacle. We can scarce believe that among men of the same period and\r\nthe same city so much ferocity could be displayed in opposition to so\r\nmuch courage, the passion for barbarity against the passion for virtue.\r\nNevertheless, such is history; and it should be represented as it really\r\nwas: first of all, for truth's sake; then for the due appreciation of\r\nvirtue and all it costs of effort and sacrifice; and, lastly, for the\r\npurpose of showing what obstacles have to be surmounted, what struggles\r\nendured, and what sufferings borne, when the question is the\r\naccomplishment of great moral and social reforms. Marcus Aurelius was,\r\nwithout any doubt, a virtuous ruler, and one who had it in his heart to\r\nbe just and humane; but he was an absolute ruler, that is to say, one\r\nfed entirely on his own ideas, very ill-informed about the facts on\r\nwhich he had to decide, and without a free public to warn him of the\r\nerrors of his ideas or the practical results of his decrees. He ordered\r\nthe persecution of the Christians without knowing what the Christians\r\nwere or what the persecution would be, and this conscientious\r\nphilosopher let loose at Lyons, against the most conscientious of\r\nsubjects, the zealous servility of his agents, and the atrocious\r\npassions of the mob.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Christians did not stop at Lyons or with Marcus\r\nAurelius; it became, during the third century, the common practice of\r\nthe emperors in all parts of the empire: from A.D. 202 to 312, under the\r\nreigns of Septimius Severus, Maximinus the First, Decius, Valerian,\r\nAurelian, Diocletian, Maximian, and Galerius, there are reckoned six\r\ngreat general persecutions, without counting others more circumscribed\r\nor less severe. The emperors Alexander Severus, Philip the Arabian, and\r\nConstantius Chlorus were almost the only exceptions to this cruel\r\nsystem; and nearly always, wherever it was in force, the pagan mob, in\r\nits brutality or fanatical superstition, added to imperial rigor its own\r\natrocious and cynical excesses.\r\n\r\nBut Christian zeal was superior in perseverance and efficacy to pagan\r\npersecution. St. Pothinus the Martyr was succeeded as bishop at Lyons by\r\nSt. Irenæus, the most learned, most judicious, and most illustrious of\r\nthe early heads of the Church in Gaul. Originally from Asia Minor,\r\nprobably from Smyrna, he had migrated to Gaul, at what particular date\r\nis not known, and had settled as a simple priest in the diocese of\r\nLyons, where it was not long before he exercised vast influence, as well\r\non the spot as also during certain missions intrusted to him, and among\r\nthem one, they say, to the pope, St. Eleutherius, at Rome.\r\n\r\nWhile bishop of Lyons, from A.D. 177 to 202, he employed the\r\nfive-and-twenty years in propagating the Christian faith in Gaul, and in\r\ndefending, by his writings, the Christian doctrines against the discord\r\nto which they had already been subjected in the East, and which was\r\nbeginning to penetrate the West.\r\n\r\nIn 202, during the persecution instituted by Septimius Severus, St.\r\nIrenæus crowned by martyrdom his active and influential life. It was in\r\nhis episcopate that there began what may be called the swarm of\r\nChristian missionaries who, toward the end of the second and during the\r\nthird century, spread over the whole of Gaul, preaching the faith and\r\nforming churches. Some went from Lyons at the instigation of St.\r\nIrenæus; others from Rome, especially under the pontificate of Pope St.\r\nFabian, himself martyred in 249; St. Felix and St. Fortunatus to\r\nValence, St. Ferréol to Besançon, St. Marcellus to Châlons-sur-Saône,\r\nSt. Benignus to Dijon, St. Trophimus to Arles, St. Paul to Narbonne, St.\r\nSaturninus to Toulouse, St. Martial to Limoges, St. Andéol and St.\r\nPrivatus to the Cévennes, St. Austremoine to Clermont-Ferrand, St.\r\nGalian to Tours, St. Denis to Paris, and so many others that their names\r\nare scarcely known beyond the pages of erudite historians, or the very\r\nspots where they preached, struggled, and conquered, often at the price\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\nSuch were the founders of the faith and of the Christian Church in\r\nFrance. At the commencement of the fourth century their work was, if not\r\naccomplished, at any rate triumphant; and when, A.D. 312, Constantine\r\ndeclared himself a Christian, he confirmed the fact of the conquest of\r\nthe Roman world, and of Gaul in particular, by Christianity. No doubt\r\nthe majority of the inhabitants were not as yet Christians; but it was\r\nclear that the Christians were in the ascendant and had command of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nOf the two grand elements which were to meet together on the ruins of\r\nRoman society, for the formation of modern society, the moral element,\r\nthe Christian religion, had already taken possession of souls; the\r\ndevastated territory awaited the coming of new peoples, known to history\r\nunder the general name of Germans, whom the Romans called the\r\nBarbarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF ROME'S DECLINE: COMMODUS\r\n\r\nA.D. 180\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON\r\n\r\n     That a ruler of such noble character as the Roman philosopher\r\n     Marcus Aurelius should have had for his son and successor a man\r\n     like Commodus is one of the strange contrasts of history. The\r\n     succession of Commodus, marking as it does the beginning of the\r\n     decline of the great empire, may be regarded as one of the most\r\n     critical moments in the existence of Rome. How folly and cruelty,\r\n     shameless vice and unbridled ferocity, may be associated in the\r\n     same character has often been illustrated in the careers of the\r\n     world's rulers, and nowhere more conspicuously than in some of the\r\n     Roman emperors; and in the case of Commodus the combination of\r\n     these qualities led to acts which involved not only the Emperor\r\n     himself, but also the empire over which he ruled, in fatal\r\n     consequences.\r\n\r\n     This vast empire, composed of many different peoples, was under the\r\n     rule and subject to the caprice of one man. The form of the\r\n     government imposed practically no checks on his power. With such\r\n     able emperors as Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius the\r\n     State was safe; but the wise men of Rome had foreseen that a tyrant\r\n     or weak and inexperienced ruler, under this system, might plunge\r\n     the empire into confusion and ruin. Yet they had made no provision\r\n     against such a contingency. In the death of such a ruler and the\r\n     accession of an abler and juster one lay their only hope of\r\n     amelioration.\r\n\r\n     The course of events during the bloody reign of the degenerate\r\n     Commodus was such as surely to forecast the decline of Roman power\r\n     and supremacy. In the next hundred years there were twenty-three\r\n     emperors, thirteen of whom were murdered by their own soldiers or\r\n     servants--a tragic period of cruelty, licentiousness, and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world\r\nduring which the condition of the human race was most happy and\r\nprosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from\r\nthe death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus. The vast extent of\r\nthe Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of\r\nvirtue and wisdom. The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle\r\nhand of four successive emperors, whose characters and authority\r\ncommanded involuntary respect. The forms of the civil administration\r\nwere carefully preserved by Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines,\r\nwho delighted in the image of liberty, and were pleased with considering\r\nthemselves as the accountable ministers of the laws. Such princes\r\ndeserved the honor of restoring the republic, had the Romans of their\r\ndays been capable of enjoying a rational freedom.\r\n\r\nThe labors of these monarchs were overpaid by the immense reward that\r\ninseparably waited on their success, by the honest pride of virtue, and\r\nby the exquisite delight of beholding the general happiness of which\r\nthey were the authors. A just but melancholy reflection imbittered,\r\nhowever, the noblest of human enjoyments. They must often have\r\nrecollected the instability of a happiness which depended on the\r\ncharacter of a single man. The fatal moment was perhaps approaching when\r\nsome licentious youth or some jealous tyrant would abuse, to the\r\ndestruction, that absolute power which they had exerted for the benefit\r\nof their people. The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws might\r\nserve to display the virtues, but could never correct the vices, of the\r\nemperor. The military force was a blind and irresistible instrument of\r\noppression, and the corruption of Roman manners would always supply\r\nflatterers eager to applaud, and ministers prepared to serve, the fear\r\nor the avarice, the lust or the cruelty, of their masters.\r\n\r\nThese gloomy apprehensions had been already justified by the experience\r\nof the Romans. The annals of the emperors exhibit a strong and various\r\npicture of human nature, which we should vainly seek among the mixed and\r\ndoubtful characters of modern history. In the conduct of those monarchs\r\nwe may trace the utmost lines of vice and virtue; the most exalted\r\nperfection, and the meanest degeneracy of our own species.\r\n\r\nThe mildness of Marcus Aurelius, which the rigid discipline of the\r\nStoics was unable to eradicate, formed, at the same time, the most\r\namiable, and the only defective, part of his character. His excellent\r\nunderstanding was often deceived by the unsuspecting goodness of his\r\nheart. Artful men, who study the passions of princes, and conceal their\r\nown, approached his person in the disguise of philosophic sanctity, and\r\nacquired riches and honors by affecting to despise them. His excessive\r\nindulgence to his brother,[46] his wife, and his son exceeded the bounds\r\nof private virtue, and became a public injury, by the example and\r\nconsequences of their vices.\r\n\r\nFaustina, the daughter of Pius and the wife of Marcus, has been as much\r\ncelebrated for her gallantries as for her beauty. The grave simplicity\r\nof the philosopher was ill-calculated to engage her wanton levity, or to\r\nfix that unbounded passion for variety which often discovered personal\r\nmerit in the meanest of mankind. The Cupid of the ancients was, in\r\ngeneral, a very sensual deity; and the amours of an empress, as they\r\nexact on her side the plainest advances, are seldom susceptible of much\r\nsentimental delicacy. Marcus was the only man in the empire who seemed\r\nignorant or insensible of the irregularities of Faustina, which,\r\naccording to the prejudices of every age, reflected some disgrace on the\r\ninjured husband. He promoted several of her lovers to posts of honor and\r\nprofit, and, during a connection of thirty years, invariably gave her\r\nproofs of the most tender confidence and of a respect which ended not\r\nwith her life. In his _Meditations_ he thanks the gods, who had bestowed\r\non him a wife so faithful, so gentle, and of such a wonderful simplicity\r\nof manners. The obsequious senate, at his earnest request, declared her\r\na goddess. She was represented in her temples with the attributes of\r\nJuno, Venus, and Ceres; and it was decreed that, on the day of their\r\nnuptials, the youth of either sex should pay their vows before the altar\r\nof their chaste patroness.\r\n\r\nThe monstrous vices of the son have cast a shade on the purity of the\r\nfather's virtues. It has been objected to Marcus that he sacrificed the\r\nhappiness of millions to a fond partiality for a worthless boy; and that\r\nhe chose a successor in his own family rather than in the empire.\r\nNothing, however, was neglected by the anxious father, and by the men of\r\nvirtue and learning whom he summoned to his assistance, to expand the\r\nnarrow mind of young Commodus, to correct his growing vices, and to\r\nrender him worthy of the throne for which he was designed. But the power\r\nof instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy\r\ndispositions where it is almost superfluous. The distasteful lesson of\r\na grave philosopher was, in a moment, obliterated by the whisper of a\r\nprofligate favorite; and Marcus himself blasted the fruits of this\r\nlabored education by admitting his son, at the age of fourteen or\r\nfifteen, to a full participation of the imperial power. He lived but\r\nfour years afterward; but he lived long enough to repent a rash measure\r\nwhich raised the impetuous youth above the restraint of reason and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nMost of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society are\r\nproduced by the restraints which the necessary but unequal laws of\r\nproperty have imposed on the appetites of mankind by confining to a few\r\nthe possession of those objects that are coveted by many. Of all our\r\npassions and appetites the love of power is of the most imperious and\r\nunsociable nature, since the pride of one man requires the submission of\r\nthe multitude. In the tumult of civil discord, the laws of society lose\r\ntheir force, and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity.\r\nThe ardor of contention, the pride of victory, the despair of success,\r\nthe memory of past injuries, and the fear of future dangers all\r\ncontribute to inflame the mind and to silence the voice of pity. From\r\nsuch motives almost every page of history has been stained with civil\r\nblood; but these motives will not account for the unprovoked cruelties\r\nof Commodus, who had nothing to wish and everything to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe beloved son of Marcus succeeded to his father, amid the acclamations\r\nof the senate and armies; and when he ascended the throne the happy\r\nyouth saw round him neither competitor to remove nor enemies to punish.\r\nIn this calm, elevated station it was surely natural that he should\r\nprefer the love of mankind to their detestation, the mild glories of his\r\nfive predecessors to the ignominious fate of Nero and Domitian.\r\n\r\nYet Commodus was not, as he has been represented, a tiger born with an\r\ninsatiate thirst of human blood, and capable, from his infancy, of the\r\nmost inhuman actions. Nature had formed him of a weak rather than a\r\nwicked disposition. His simplicity and timidity rendered him the slave\r\nof his attendants, who gradually corrupted his mind. His cruelty, which\r\nat first obeyed the dictates of others, degenerated into habit, and at\r\nlength became the ruling passion of his soul.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of his father, Commodus found himself embarrassed with\r\nthe command of a great army, and the conduct of a difficult war against\r\nthe Quadi and Marcomanni. The servile and profligate youths whom Marcus\r\nhad banished soon regained their station and influence about the new\r\nEmperor. They exaggerated the hardships and dangers of a campaign in the\r\nwild countries beyond the Danube; and they assured the indolent prince\r\nthat the terror of his name and the arms of his lieutenants would be\r\nsufficient to complete the conquest of the dismayed barbarians, or to\r\nimpose such conditions as were more advantageous than any conquest. By a\r\ndexterous application to his sensual appetites they compared the\r\ntranquillity, the splendor, the refined pleasures of Rome with the\r\ntumult of a Pannonian camp, which afforded neither leisure nor materials\r\nfor luxury. Commodus listened to the pleasing advice, but while he\r\nhesitated between his own inclination and the awe which he still\r\nretained for his father's counsellors, the summer insensibly elapsed,\r\nand his triumphal entry into the capital was deferred till the autumn.\r\nHis graceful person, popular address, and imagined virtues attracted the\r\npublic favor; the honorable peace which he had recently granted to the\r\nbarbarians diffused a universal joy; his impatience to revisit Rome was\r\nfondly ascribed to the love of his country; and his dissolute course of\r\namusements was faintly condemned in a prince of nineteen years of age.\r\n\r\nDuring the three first years of his reign the forms, and even the\r\nspirit, of the old administration were maintained by those faithful\r\ncounsellors to whom Marcus had recommended his son, and for whose wisdom\r\nand integrity Commodus still entertained a reluctant esteem. The young\r\nprince and his profligate favorites revelled in all the license of\r\nsovereign power; but his hands were yet unstained with blood; and he had\r\neven displayed a generosity of sentiment which might perhaps have\r\nripened into solid virtue.[47] A fatal incident decided his fluctuating\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as the Emperor was returning to the palace through a dark\r\nand narrow portico in the Amphitheatre, an assassin, who waited his\r\npassage, rushed upon him with a drawn sword, loudly exclaiming, \"_The\r\nsenate sends you this_.\" The menace prevented the deed; the assassin was\r\nseized by the guards, and immediately revealed the authors of the\r\nconspiracy. It had been formed, not in the state, but within the walls\r\nof the palace. Lucilla, the Emperor's sister, and widow of Lucius Verus,\r\nimpatient of the second rank, and jealous of the reigning empress, had\r\narmed the murderer against her brother's life. She had not ventured to\r\ncommunicate the black design to her second husband, Claudius Pompeianus,\r\na senator of distinguished merit and unshaken loyalty; but among the\r\ncrowd of her lovers--for she imitated the manners of Faustina--she found\r\nmen of desperate fortunes and wild ambition, who were prepared to serve\r\nher more violent as well as her tender passions. The conspirators\r\nexperienced the rigor of justice, and the abandoned princess was\r\npunished, first with exile, and afterward with death.\r\n\r\nBut the words of the assassin sunk deep into the mind of Commodus, and\r\nleft an indelible impression of fear and hatred against the whole body\r\nof the senate. Those whom he had dreaded as importunate ministers he now\r\nsuspected as secret enemies. The delators, a race of men discouraged and\r\nalmost extinguished under the former reigns, again became formidable, as\r\nsoon as they discovered that the Emperor was desirous of finding\r\ndisaffection and treason in the senate. That assembly, whom Marcus had\r\never considered as the great council of the nation, was composed of the\r\nmost distinguished of the Romans; and distinction of every kind soon\r\nbecame criminal. The possession of wealth stimulated the diligence of\r\nthe informers; rigid virtue implied a tacit censure of the\r\nirregularities of Commodus; important services implied a dangerous\r\nsuperiority of merit; and the friendship of the father always insured\r\nthe aversion of the son. Suspicion was equivalent to proof; trial to\r\ncondemnation. The execution of a considerable senator was attended with\r\nthe death of all who might lament or revenge his fate, and when Commodus\r\nhad once tasted human blood he became incapable of pity or remorse.\r\n\r\nOf these innocent victims of tyranny none died more lamented than the\r\ntwo brothers of the Quintilian family, Maximus and Condianus, whose\r\nfraternal love has saved their names from oblivion and endeared their\r\nmemory to posterity. Their studies and their occupations, their pursuits\r\nand their pleasures, were still the same. In the enjoyment of a great\r\nestate they never admitted the idea of a separate interest: some\r\nfragments are now extant of a treatise which they composed in common;\r\nand in every action of life it was observed that their two bodies were\r\nanimated by one soul. The Antonines, who valued their virtues and\r\ndelighted in their union, raised them, in the same year, to the\r\nconsulship; and Marcus afterward intrusted to their joint care the civil\r\nadministration of Greece, and a great military command, in which they\r\nobtained a signal victory over the Germans. The kind cruelty of Commodus\r\nunited them in death.\r\n\r\nThe tyrant's rage, after having shed the noblest blood of the senate, at\r\nlength recoiled on the principal instrument of his cruelty. While\r\nCommodus was immersed in blood and luxury, he devolved the detail of the\r\npublic business on Perennis, a servile and ambitious minister, who had\r\nobtained his post by the murder of his predecessor, but who possessed a\r\nconsiderable share of vigor and ability. By acts of extortion and the\r\nforfeited estates of the nobles sacrificed to his avarice he had\r\naccumulated an immense treasure. The prætorian guards were under his\r\nimmediate command; and his son, who already discovered a military\r\ngenius, was at the head of the Illyrian legions. Perennis aspired to the\r\nempire; or what, in the eyes of Commodus, amounted to the same crime, he\r\nwas capable of aspiring to it, had he not been prevented, surprised, and\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\nThe fall of a minister is a very trifling incident in the general\r\nhistory of the empire; but it was hastened by an extraordinary\r\ncircumstance, which proved how much the nerves of discipline were\r\nalready relaxed. The legions of Britain, discontented with the\r\nadministration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen hundred\r\nselect men, with instructions to march to Rome and lay their complaints\r\nbefore the Emperor. These military petitioners, by their own determined\r\nbehavior, by inflaming the divisions of the guards, by exaggerating the\r\nstrength of the British army, and by alarming the fears of Commodus,\r\nexacted and obtained the minister's death, as the only redress of their\r\ngrievances. This presumption of a distant army, and their discovery of\r\nthe weakness of government, were a sure presage of the most dreadful\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nThe negligence of the public administration was betrayed, soon\r\nafterward, by a new disorder, which arose from the smallest beginnings.\r\nA spirit of desertion began to prevail among the troops; and the\r\ndeserters, instead of seeking their safety in flight or concealment,\r\ninfested the highways. Maternus, a private soldier, of a daring boldness\r\nabove his station, collected those bands of robbers into a little army,\r\nset open the prisons, invited the slaves to assert their freedom, and\r\nplundered with impunity the rich and defenceless cities of Gaul and\r\nSpain. The governors of the provinces, who had long been the spectators,\r\nand perhaps the partners, of his depredations, were at length roused\r\nfrom their supine indolence by the threatening commands of the Emperor.\r\nMaternus found that he was encompassed, and foresaw that he must be\r\noverpowered. A great effort of despair was his last resource. He ordered\r\nhis followers to disperse, to pass the Alps in small parties and various\r\ndisguises, and to assemble at Rome, during the licentious tumult of the\r\nfestival of Cybele. To murder Commodus, and to ascend the vacant throne,\r\nwere the ambition of no vulgar robber. His measures were so ably\r\nconcerted that his concealed troops already filled the streets of Rome.\r\nThe envy of an accomplice discovered and ruined this singular enterprise\r\nin the moment when it was ripe for execution.\r\n\r\nSuspicious princes often promote the last of mankind from a vain\r\npersuasion that those who have no dependence, except on their favor,\r\nwill have no attachment, except to the person of their benefactor.\r\nCleander, the successor of Perennis, was a Phrygian by birth; of a\r\nnation over whose stubborn but servile temper blows only could prevail.\r\nHe had been sent from his native country to Rome, in the capacity of a\r\nslave. As a slave he entered the imperial palace, rendered himself\r\nuseful to his master's passions, and rapidly ascended to the most\r\nexalted station which a subject could enjoy. His influence over the\r\nmind of Commodus was much greater than that of his predecessor; for\r\nCleander was devoid of any ability or virtue which could inspire the\r\nEmperor with envy or distrust.\r\n\r\nAvarice was the reigning passion of his soul and the great principle of\r\nhis administration. The rank of consul, of patrician, of senator, was\r\nexposed to public sale; and it would have been considered as\r\ndisaffection if anyone had refused to purchase these empty and\r\ndisgraceful honors, with the greatest part of his fortune. In the\r\nlucrative provincial employments the minister shared with the governor\r\nthe spoils of the people. The execution of the laws was venal and\r\narbitrary. A wealthy criminal might obtain not only the reversal of the\r\nsentence by which he was justly condemned, but might likewise inflict\r\nwhatever punishment he pleased on the accuser, the witnesses, and the\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nBy these means Cleander, in the space of three years, had accumulated\r\nmore wealth than had ever yet been possessed by any freedman. Commodus\r\nwas perfectly satisfied with the magnificent presents which the artful\r\ncourtier laid at his feet in the most seasonable moments. To divert the\r\npublic envy, Cleander, under the Emperor's name, erected baths,\r\nporticoes, and places of exercise for the use of the people. He\r\nflattered himself that the Romans, dazzled and amused by this apparent\r\nliberality, would be less affected by the bloody scenes which were daily\r\nexhibited; that they would forget the death of Byrrhus, a senator to\r\nwhose superior merit the late Emperor had granted one of his daughters;\r\nand that they would forgive the execution of Arrius Antoninus, the last\r\nrepresentative of the name and virtues of the Antonines. The former,\r\nwith more integrity than prudence, had attempted to disclose, to his\r\nbrother-in-law, the true character of Cleander. An equitable sentence\r\npronounced by the latter, when proconsul of Asia, against a worthless\r\ncreature of the favorite proved fatal to him. After the fall of\r\nPerennis, the terrors of Commodus had for a short time assumed the\r\nappearance of a return to virtue. He repealed the most odious of his\r\nacts, loaded his memory with the public execration, and ascribed to the\r\npernicious counsels of that wicked minister all the errors of his\r\ninexperienced youth. But his repentance lasted only thirty days; and,\r\nunder Cleander's tyranny, the administration of Perennis was often\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nPestilence and famine contributed to fill up the measure of the\r\ncalamities of Rome. The first could be only imputed to the just\r\nindignation of the gods; but a monopoly of corn, supported by the riches\r\nand power of the minister, was considered as the immediate cause of the\r\nsecond. The popular discontent, after it had long circulated in\r\nwhispers, broke out in the assembled Circus. The people quitted their\r\nfavorite amusements for the more delicious pleasure of revenge, rushed\r\nin crowds toward a palace in the suburbs, one of the Emperor's\r\nretirements, and demanded, with angry clamors, the head of the public\r\nenemy. Cleander, who commanded the prætorian guards, ordered a body of\r\ncavalry to sally forth and disperse the seditious multitude. The\r\nmultitude fled with precipitation toward the city; several were slain,\r\nand many more were trampled to death; but when the cavalry entered the\r\nstreets their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and darts from\r\nthe roofs and windows of the houses.\r\n\r\nThe foot-guards, who had been long jealous of the prerogatives and\r\ninsolence of the prætorian cavalry, embraced the party of the people.\r\nThe tumult became a regular engagement, and threatened a general\r\nmassacre. The prætorians at length gave way, oppressed with numbers; and\r\nthe tide of popular fury returned with redoubled violence against the\r\ngates of the palace, where Commodus lay, dissolved in luxury, and alone\r\nunconscious of the civil war. It was death to approach his person with\r\nthe unwelcome news. He would have perished in this supine security had\r\nnot two women, his eldest sister Fadilla, and Marcia, the most favored\r\nof his concubines, ventured to break into his presence. Bathed in tears,\r\nand with dishevelled hair, they threw themselves at his feet, and, with\r\nall the pressing eloquence of fear, discovered to the affrighted Emperor\r\nthe crimes of the minister, the rage of the people, and the impending\r\nruin which, in a few minutes, would burst over his palace and person.\r\nCommodus started from his dream of pleasure and commanded that the head\r\nof Cleander should be thrown out to the people. The desired spectacle\r\ninstantly appeased the tumult; and the son of Marcus might even yet have\r\nregained the affection and confidence of his subjects.\r\n\r\nBut every sentiment of virtue and humanity was extinct in the mind of\r\nCommodus. While he thus abandoned the reins of empire to these unworthy\r\nfavorites, he valued nothing in sovereign power except the unbounded\r\nlicense of indulging his sensual appetites. The influence of a polite\r\nage and the labor of an attentive education had never been able to\r\ninfuse into his rude and brutish mind the least tincture of learning;\r\nand he was the first of the Roman emperors totally devoid of taste for\r\nthe pleasures of the understanding. Nero himself excelled, or affected\r\nto excel, in the elegant arts of music and poetry; nor should we despise\r\nhis pursuits, had he not converted the pleasing relaxation of a leisure\r\nhour into the serious business and ambition of his life. But Commodus,\r\nfrom his earliest infancy, discovered an aversion to whatever was\r\nrational or liberal, and a fond attachment to the amusements of the\r\npopulace; the sports of the Circus and Amphitheatre, the combats of\r\ngladiators, and the hunting of wild beasts. The masters in every branch\r\nof learning, whom Marcus provided for his son, were heard with\r\ninattention and disgust, while the Moors and Parthians, who taught him\r\nto dart the javelin and to shoot with the bow, found a disciple who\r\ndelighted in his application, and soon equalled the most skilful of his\r\ninstructors in the steadiness of the eye and the dexterity of the hand.\r\n\r\nThe servile crowd, whose fortune depended on their master's vices,\r\napplauded these ignoble pursuits. The perfidious voice of flattery\r\nreminded him that by exploits of the same nature, by the defeat of the\r\nNemæan lion, and the slaughter of the wild boar of Erymanthus, the\r\nGrecian Hercules had acquired a place among the gods and an immortal\r\nmemory among men. They only forgot to observe that in the first ages of\r\nsociety, when the fiercer animals often dispute with man the possession\r\nof an unsettled country, a successful war against those savages is one\r\nof the most innocent and beneficial labors of heroism. In the civilized\r\nstate of the Roman Empire the wild beasts had long since retired from\r\nthe face of man and the neighborhood of populous cities. To surprise\r\nthem in their solitary haunts and to transport them to Rome that they\r\nmight be slain in pomp by the hand of an emperor was an enterprise\r\nequally ridiculous for the prince and oppressive for the people.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of these distinctions, Commodus eagerly embraced the glorious\r\nresemblance and styled himself (as we still read on his medals) the\r\nRoman Hercules. The club and the lion's hide were placed by the side of\r\nthe throne, among the ensigns of sovereignty, and statues were erected\r\nin which Commodus was represented in the character and with the\r\nattributes of the god whose valor and dexterity he endeavored to emulate\r\nin the daily course of his ferocious amusements.\r\n\r\nElated with these praises, which gradually extinguished the innate sense\r\nof shame, Commodus resolved to exhibit before the eyes of the Roman\r\npeople those exercises which till then he had decently confined within\r\nthe walls of his palace and to the presence of a few favorites. On the\r\nappointed day the various motives of flattery, fear, and curiosity\r\nattracted to the Amphitheatre an innumerable multitude of spectators;\r\nand some degree of applause was deservedly bestowed on the uncommon\r\nskill of the imperial performer. Whether he aimed at the head or heart\r\nof the animal, the wound was alike certain and mortal. With arrows whose\r\npoint was shaped into the form of a crescent Commodus often intercepted\r\nthe rapid career and cut asunder the long, bony neck of the ostrich.\r\n\r\nA panther was let loose, and the archer waited till he had leaped upon a\r\ntrembling malefactor. In the same instant the shaft flew, the beast\r\ndropped dead, and the man remained unhurt. The dens of the Amphitheatre\r\ndisgorged at once a hundred lions: a hundred darts from the unerring\r\nhand of Commodus laid them dead as they ran raging round the arena.\r\nNeither the huge bulk of the elephant nor the scaly hide of the\r\nrhinoceros could defend them from his stroke. Æthiopia and India yielded\r\ntheir most extraordinary productions; and several animals were slain in\r\nthe Amphitheatre which had been seen only in the representations of art\r\nor perhaps of fancy. In all these exhibitions the securest precautions\r\nwere used to protect the person of the Roman Hercules from the desperate\r\nspring of any savage, who might possibly disregard the dignity of the\r\nEmperor and the sanctity of the god.\r\n\r\nBut the meanest of the populace were affected with shame and indignation\r\nwhen they beheld their sovereign enter the lists as a gladiator, and\r\nglory in a profession which the laws and manners of the Romans had\r\nbranded with the justest note of infamy.[48] He chose the habit and arms\r\nof the _secutor_, whose combat with the _retiarius_ formed one of the\r\nmost lively scenes in the bloody sports of the Amphitheatre. The secutor\r\nwas armed with a helmet, sword, and buckler; his naked antagonist had\r\nonly a large net and a trident; with the one he endeavored to entangle,\r\nwith the other to despatch his enemy. If he missed the first throw, he\r\nwas obliged to fly from the pursuit of the secutor till he had prepared\r\nhis net for a second cast.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor fought in this character seven hundred and thirty-five\r\nseveral times. These glorious achievements were carefully recorded in\r\nthe public acts of the empire; and that he might omit no circumstance of\r\ninfamy, he received from the common fund of gladiators a stipend so\r\nexorbitant that it became a new and most ignominious tax upon the Roman\r\npeople. It may be easily supposed that in these engagements the master\r\nof the world was always successful; in the Amphitheatre his victories\r\nwere not often sanguinary; but when he exercised his skill in the school\r\nof gladiators or his own palace, his wretched antagonists were\r\nfrequently honored with a mortal wound from the hand of Commodus, and\r\nobliged to seal their flattery with their blood.\r\n\r\nHe now disdained the appellation of Hercules. The name of Paulus, a\r\ncelebrated secutor, was the only one which delighted his ear. It was\r\ninscribed on his colossal statues and repeated in the redoubled\r\nacclamations of the mournful and applauding senate. Claudius Pompeianus,\r\nthe virtuous husband of Lucilla, was the only senator who asserted the\r\nhonor of his rank. As a father, he permitted his sons to consult their\r\nsafety by attending the Amphitheatre. As a Roman he declared that his\r\nown life was in the Emperor's hands, but that he would never behold the\r\nson of Marcus prostituting his person and dignity. Notwithstanding his\r\nmanly resolution, Pompeianus escaped the resentment of the tyrant, and,\r\nwith his honor, had the good fortune to preserve his life.\r\n\r\nCommodus had now attained the summit of vice and infamy. Amid the\r\nacclamations of a flattering court he was unable to disguise from\r\nhimself that he had deserved the contempt and hatred of every man of\r\nsense and virtue in his empire. His ferocious spirit was irritated by\r\nthe consciousness of that hatred, by the envy of every kind of merit, by\r\nthe just apprehension of danger, and by the habit of slaughter which he\r\ncontracted in his daily amusements. History has preserved a long list of\r\nconsular senators sacrificed to his wanton suspicion, which sought out,\r\nwith peculiar anxiety, those unfortunate persons connected, however\r\nremotely, with the family of the Antonines, without sparing even the\r\nministers of his crimes or pleasures.\r\n\r\nHis cruelty proved at last fatal to himself. He had shed with impunity\r\nthe noblest blood of Rome: he perished as soon as he was dreaded by his\r\nown domestics. Marcia, his favorite concubine, Eclectus, his\r\nchamberlain, and Lætus, his prætorian prefect, alarmed by the fate of\r\ntheir companions and predecessors, resolved to prevent the destruction\r\nwhich every hour hung over their heads, either from the mad caprice of\r\nthe tyrant or the sudden indignation of the people. Marcia seized the\r\noccasion of presenting a draught of wine to her lover, after he had\r\nfatigued himself with hunting some wild beasts. Commodus retired to\r\nsleep; but while he was laboring with the effects of poison and\r\ndrunkenness, a robust youth, by profession a wrestler, entered his\r\nchamber and strangled him without resistance. The body was secretly\r\nconveyed out of the palace, before the least suspicion was entertained\r\nin the city, or even in the court, of the Emperor's death. Such was the\r\nfate of the son of Marcus, and so easy was it to destroy a hated tyrant,\r\nwho, by the artificial powers of government, had oppressed, during\r\nthirteen years, so many millions of subjects, each of whom was equal to\r\ntheir master in personal strength and personal abilities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] His brother by adoption, and his colleague, L. Verus. Marcus\r\nAurelius had no other brother.\r\n\r\n[47] Manilius, the confidential secretary of Avidius Cassius, was\r\ndiscovered after he had lain concealed several years. The Emperor nobly\r\nrelieved the public anxiety by refusing to see him, and burning his\r\npapers without opening them.\r\n\r\n[48] The virtuous and even the wise princes forbade the senators and\r\nknights to embrace this scandalous profession, under pain of infamy, or,\r\nwhat was more dreaded by those profligate wretches, of exile. The\r\ntyrants allured them to dishonor by threats and rewards. Nero once\r\nproduced in the arena forty senators and sixty knights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTFUL REIGN OF SAPOR I, KING OF PERSIA\r\n\r\nA.D. 240\r\n\r\nGEORGE RAWLINSON\r\n\r\n     Under Mithradates I the Parthian empire rose to great power, and\r\n     that monarch, about B.C. 163, began to make conquests toward the\r\n     west. By B.C. 150 he had added to his possessions Media Magna,\r\n     Susiana, Babylonia, Assyria proper, and Persia. The Persians appear\r\n     to have yielded without resistance to his rule, and he governed\r\n     them with a fair degree of moderation, allowing them, as was the\r\n     Parthian policy toward subject peoples, a large measure of\r\n     self-government under their hereditary native kings, the \"King of\r\n     Kings\" exacting little from them besides regular tribute and the\r\n     required number of men for his armies.\r\n\r\n     The Parthian empire was in turn overthrown by Ardashir or\r\n     Artaxerxes, who about B.C. 226 defeated and killed Ardavan, the\r\n     last Parthian king, and became the chief founder of the Sassanian\r\n     dynasty, which ruled Persia until the Mahometan invasion.\r\n\r\n     The victories of Artaxerxes had fatal results for the Roman power\r\n     in the East, for the new head of the Persian monarchy was no sooner\r\n     established on his throne than he sent an embassy to the Roman\r\n     Emperor, Alexander Severus, to demand from him the surrender of all\r\n     Asia and the withdrawal of Roman arms and authority to the western\r\n     shores of the Ægean Sea and of the Propontis, as the Sea of Marmora\r\n     was anciently called. From this began a series of wars which\r\n     continued at intervals for four centuries, and which ended only\r\n     with the Mahometan conquests that overwhelmed Roman and Persian\r\n     power alike. The first campaigns of the Romans against Artaxerxes\r\n     were indecisive, but the renewal of the war in the reign of his\r\n     son, Sapor I, was followed by disasters to the Roman arms which\r\n     Rawlinson describes in his most lucid and vigorous manner, together\r\n     with the other feats of this remarkable man.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtaxerxes appears to have died in A.D. 240. He was succeeded by his son\r\nShahpuhri, or Sapor, the first Sassanian prince of that name. According\r\nto the Persian historians, the mother of Sapor was a daughter of the\r\nlast Parthian king, Artabanus, whom Artaxerxes had taken to wife after\r\nhis conquest of her father. But the facts known of Sapor throw doubt on\r\nthis story, which has too many parallels in oriental romance to claim\r\nimplicit credence. Nothing authentic has come down to us respecting\r\nSapor during his father's lifetime, but from the moment that he mounted\r\nthe throne we find him engaged in a series of wars, which show him to\r\nhave been of a most active and energetic character.\r\n\r\nArmenia, which Artaxerxes had subjected, attempted, it would seem, to\r\nregain its independence at the commencement of the reign; but Sapor\r\neasily crushed the nascent insurrection, and the Armenians made no\r\nfurther effort to free themselves till several years after his death.\r\nContemporaneously with this revolt in the mountain region of the North a\r\ndanger showed itself in the plains country of the South, where Manizen,\r\nking of Hatra, or El Hadhr, not only declared himself independent, but\r\nassumed dominion over the entire tract between the Euphrates and the\r\nTigris, the Jezireh of the Arabian geographers.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Hatra was great, as had been proved by Trajan and\r\nSeverus; its thick walls and valiant inhabitants would probably have\r\ndefied every attempt of the Persian prince to make himself master of it\r\nby force. He, therefore, resorted to stratagem. Manizen had a daughter\r\nwho cherished ambitious views. On obtaining a promise from Sapor that if\r\nshe gave Hatra into his power he would make her his queen, this\r\nunnatural child turned against her father, betrayed him into Sapor's\r\nhands, and thus brought the war to an end. Sapor recovered his lost\r\nterritory; but he did not fulfil his bargain. Instead of marrying the\r\ntraitoress, he handed her over to an executioner, to receive the death\r\nthat she had deserved, though scarcely at his hands.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his success in these two lesser contests, Sapor resolved\r\n(apparently in A.D. 241) to resume the bold projects of his father, and\r\nengage in a great war with Rome. The confusion and troubles which\r\nafflicted the Roman Empire at this time were such as might well give him\r\nhopes of obtaining a decided advantage. Alexander, his father's\r\nadversary, had been murdered in A.D. 235 by Maximin, who from the\r\ncondition of a Thracian peasant had risen into the higher ranks of the\r\narmy. The upstart had ruled like the savage that he was, and after three\r\nyears of misery the whole Roman world had risen against him. Two\r\nemperors had been proclaimed in Africa. On their fall two others had\r\nbeen elected by the senate; a third, a mere boy, had been added at the\r\ndemand of the Roman populace. All the pretenders except the last had met\r\nwith violent deaths; and after the shocks of a year, unparalleled since\r\nA.D. 69, the administration of the greatest kingdom in the world was in\r\nthe hands of a youth of fifteen. Sapor, no doubt, thought he saw in this\r\ncondition of things an opportunity that he ought not to miss, and\r\nrapidly matured his plans lest the favorable moment should pass away.\r\n\r\nCrossing the middle Tigris into Mesopotamia, the bands of Sapor first\r\nattacked the important city of Nisibis. Nisibis, at the time a Roman\r\ncolony, was strongly situated on the outskirts of the mountain range\r\nwhich traverses Northern Mesopotamia between the thirty-seventh and\r\nthirty-eighth parallels. The place was well fortified and well defended;\r\nit offered a prolonged resistance; but the walls were breached and it\r\nwas forced to yield itself. The advance was then made along the southern\r\nflank of the mountains by Carrhæ (Harran) and Edessa to the Euphrates,\r\nwhich was probably reached in the neighborhood of Birehjik. The hordes\r\nthen poured into Syria, and, spreading themselves over that fertile\r\nregion, surprised and took the metropolis of the Roman East, the rich\r\nand luxurious city of Antioch. But meantime the Romans had shown a\r\nspirit which had not been expected from them.\r\n\r\nGordian, young as he was, had quitted Rome and marched through Moesia\r\nand Thrace into Asia, accompanied by a formidable army and by at least\r\none good general. Timesitheus, whose daughter Gordian had recently\r\nmarried, though his life had hitherto been that of a civilian, exhibited\r\non his elevation to the dignity of prætorian prefect considerable\r\nmilitary ability. The army, nominally commanded by Gordian, really acted\r\nunder his orders. With it Timesitheus attacked and beat the bands of\r\nSapor in a number of engagements, recovered Antioch, crossed the\r\nEuphrates, retook Carrhæ, defeated the Persian monarch in a pitched\r\nbattle near Resaina (Ras-el-Ain), recovered Nisibis, and once more\r\nplanted the Roman standards on the banks of the Tigris. Sapor hastily\r\nevacuated most of his conquests, and retired first across the Euphrates,\r\nand then across the more eastern river, while the Romans advanced as he\r\nretreated, placed garrisons in the various Mesopotamian towns, and even\r\nthreatened the great city of Ctesiphon.\r\n\r\nGordian was confident that his general would gain further triumphs, and\r\nwrote to the senate to that effect; but either disease or the arts of a\r\nrival cut short the career of the victor, and from the time of his death\r\nthe Romans ceased to be successful. The legions had, it would seem,\r\ninvaded Southern Mesopotamia when the prætorian prefect who had\r\nsucceeded Timesitheus brought them intentionally into difficulties by\r\nhis mismanagement of the commissariat, and at last retreat was\r\ndetermined on.\r\n\r\nThe young Emperor had almost reached his own frontier, when the\r\ndiscontent of the army, fomented by the prefect, Philip, came to a head.\r\nGordian was murdered at a place called Zaitha, about twenty miles south\r\nof Circesium, and was buried where he fell, the soldiers raising a\r\ntumulus in his honor. His successor, Philip, was glad to make peace on\r\nany tolerable terms with the Persians; he felt himself insecure upon his\r\nthrone, and was anxious to obtain the senate's sanction of his\r\nusurpation. He therefore quitted the East in A.D. 244, having concluded\r\na treaty with Sapor by which Armenia seems to have been left to the\r\nPersians, while Mesopotamia returned to its old condition of a Roman\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe peace made between Philip and Sapor was followed by an interval of\r\nfourteen years, during which scarcely anything is known of the condition\r\nof Persia. We may suspect that troubles in the northeast of his empire\r\noccupied Sapor during this period, for at the end of it we find Bactria,\r\nwhich was certainly subject to Persia during the earlier years of the\r\nmonarchy, occupying an independent position, and even assuming an\r\nattitude of hostility toward the Persian monarch. Bactria had, from a\r\nremote antiquity, claims to preëminence among the Aryan nations. She was\r\nmore than once inclined to revolt from the Achæmenidæ, and during the\r\nlater Parthian period she had enjoyed a sort of semi-independence. It\r\nwould seem that she now succeeded in detaching herself altogether from\r\nher southern neighbor and becoming a distinct and separate power. To\r\nstrengthen her position she entered into relations with Rome, which\r\ngladly welcomed any adhesions to her cause in this remote region.\r\n\r\nSapor's second war with Rome was, like his first, provoked by himself.\r\nAfter concluding his peace with Philip he had seen the Roman world\r\ngoverned successively by six weak emperors, of whom four had died\r\nviolent deaths, while at the same time there had been a continued series\r\nof attacks upon the northern frontiers of the empire by Alamanni, Goths,\r\nand Franks, who had ravaged at will a number of the finest provinces,\r\nand threatened the absolute destruction of the great monarchy of the\r\nWest. It was natural that the chief kingdom of Western Asia should note\r\nthese events, and should seek to promote its own interests by taking\r\nadvantage of the circumstances of the time. Sapor, in A.D. 258,\r\ndetermined on a fresh invasion of the Roman provinces, and once more\r\nentering Mesopotamia carried all before him, became master of Nisibis,\r\nCarrhæ, and Edessa, and, crossing the Euphrates, surprised Antioch,\r\nwhich was wrapped in the enjoyment of theatrical and other\r\nrepresentations, and only knew its fate on the exclamation of a couple\r\nof actors that \"the Persians were in possession of the town!\" The aged\r\nEmperor, Valerian, hastened to the protection of his more eastern\r\nterritories, and at first gained some successes, retaking Antioch, and\r\nmaking that city his head-quarters during his stay in the East.\r\n\r\nBut after this the tide turned. Valerian intrusted the whole conduct of\r\nthe war to Macrianus, his prætorian prefect, whose talents he admired,\r\nand of whose fidelity he did not entertain a suspicion. Macrianus,\r\nhowever, aspired to the empire, and intentionally brought Valerian into\r\ndifficulties in the hope of disgracing or removing him. His tactics were\r\nsuccessful. The Roman army in Mesopotamia was betrayed into a situation\r\nwhence escape was impossible and where its capitulation was only a\r\nquestion of time. A bold attempt made to force a way through the enemy's\r\nlines failed utterly, after which famine and pestilence began to do\r\ntheir work. In vain did the aged Emperor send envoys to propose a peace\r\nand offer to purchase escape by the payment of an immense sum in gold.\r\nSapor, confident of victory, refused the overture, and, waiting\r\npatiently till his adversary was at the last gasp, invited him to a\r\nconference, and then treacherously seized his person. The army\r\nsurrendered or dispersed. Macrianus, the prætorian prefect, shortly\r\nassumed the title of emperor and marched against Gallienus, the son and\r\ncolleague of Valerian, who had been left to direct affairs in the West.\r\nBut another rival started up in the East. Sapor conceived the idea of\r\ncomplicating the Roman affairs by himself putting forward a pretender;\r\nand an obscure citizen of Antioch, a certain Miriades, or Cyriades, a\r\nrefugee in his camp, was invested with the purple and assumed the title\r\nof Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe blow struck at Edessa laid the whole of Roman Asia open to attack,\r\nand the Persian monarch was not slow to seize the occasion. His troops\r\ncrossed the Euphrates in force, and, marching on Antioch, once more\r\ncaptured that unfortunate town, from which the more prudent citizens had\r\nwithdrawn, but where the bulk of the people, not displeased at the turn\r\nof affairs, remained and welcomed the conqueror. Miriades was installed\r\nin power, while Sapor himself, at the head of his irresistible\r\nsquadrons, pressed forward, bursting \"like a mountain torrent\" into\r\nCilicia, and thence into Cappadocia. Tarsus, the birthplace of St. Paul,\r\nat once a famous seat of learning and a great emporium of commerce,\r\nfell; Cilicia Campestris was overrun, and the passes of Taurus, deserted\r\nor weakly defended by the Romans, came into Sapor's hand.\r\n\r\nPenetrating through them and entering the campaign country beyond, his\r\nbands soon began the siege of Cæsarea Mazaca, the greatest city of these\r\nparts, estimated at this time to have contained a population of four\r\nhundred thousand souls. Demosthenes, the governor of Cæsarea, defended\r\nit bravely, and, had force only been used against him, might have\r\nprevailed; but Sapor found friends within the walls, and by their help\r\nmade himself master of the place, while its bold defender was obliged to\r\ncontent himself with escaping by cutting his way through the victorious\r\nhost. All Asia Minor now seemed open to the conqueror; and it is\r\ndifficult to understand why he did not at any rate attempt a permanent\r\noccupation of the territory which he had so easily overrun. But it seems\r\ncertain that he entertained no such idea.\r\n\r\nDevastation and plunder, revenge and gain, not permanent conquest, were\r\nhis objects; and hence his course was everywhere marked by ruin and\r\ncarnage, by smoking towns, ravaged fields, and heaps of slain. His\r\ncruelties have no doubt been exaggerated; but when we hear that he\r\nfilled the ravines and valleys of Cappadocia with dead bodies, and so\r\nled his cavalry across them; that he depopulated Antioch, killing or\r\ncarrying off into slavery almost the whole population; that he suffered\r\nhis prisoners in many cases to perish of hunger, and that he drove them\r\nto water once a day like beasts, we may be sure that the guise in which\r\nhe showed himself to the Romans was that of a merciless scourge--an\r\navenger bent on spreading the terror of his name, not of one who really\r\nsought to enlarge the limits of his empire. During the whole course of\r\nthis plundering expedition, until the retreat began, we hear but of one\r\ncheck that the bands of Sapor received. It had been determined to attack\r\nEmesa, one of the most important of the Syrian towns, where the temple\r\nof Venus was known to contain a vast treasure. The invaders approached,\r\nscarcely expecting to be resisted; but the high-priest of the temple,\r\nhaving collected a large body of peasants, appeared in his sacerdotal\r\nrobes at the head of a fanatic multitude armed with slings, and\r\nsucceeded in beating off the assailants. Emesa, its temple, and its\r\ntreasure escaped the rapacity of the Persians; and an example of\r\nresistance was set, which was not perhaps without important\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nFor it seems certain that the return of Sapor across the Euphrates was\r\nnot effected without considerable loss and difficulty. On his advance\r\ninto Syria he had received an embassy from a certain Odenathus, a\r\nSyrian, or Arab chief, who occupied a position of semi-independence at\r\nPalmyra, which through the advantages of its situation, had lately\r\nbecome a flourishing commercial town. Odenathus sent a long train of\r\ncamels laden with gifts, consisting in part of rare and precious\r\nmerchandise, to the Persian monarch, begging him to accept them, and\r\nclaiming his favorable regard on the ground that he had hitherto\r\nrefrained from all acts of hostility against the Persians. It appears\r\nthat Sapor took offence at the tone of the communication, which was not\r\nsufficiently humble to please him. Tearing the letter to fragments and\r\ntrampling it beneath his feet he exclaimed: \"Who is this Odenathus, and\r\nof what country, that he ventures thus to address his lord? Let him now,\r\nif he would lighten his punishment, come here and fall prostrate before\r\nme with his hands tied behind his back. Should he refuse, let him be\r\nwell assured that I will destroy himself, his race, and his land.\" At\r\nthe same time he ordered his servants to cast the costly presents of the\r\nPalmyrene prince into the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThis arrogant and offensive behavior naturally turned the willing friend\r\ninto an enemy. Odenathus, finding himself forced into a hostile\r\nposition, took arms and watched his opportunity. So long as Sapor\r\ncontinued to advance he kept aloof. As soon, however, as the retreat\r\ncommenced, and the Persian army, encumbered with its spoil and captives,\r\nproceeded to make its way back slowly and painfully to the Euphrates,\r\nOdenathus, who had collected a large force--in part from the Syrian\r\nvillages, in part from the wild tribes of Arabia--made his appearance in\r\nthe field. His light and agile horsemen hovered about the Persian host,\r\ncut off their stragglers, made prize of much of their spoil, and even\r\ncaptured a portion of the seraglio of the great king.\r\n\r\nThe harassed troops were glad when they had placed the Euphrates between\r\nthemselves and their pursuer, and congratulated each other on their\r\nescape. So much had they suffered and so little did they feel equal to\r\nfurther conflicts that on their march through Mesopotamia they consented\r\nto purchase the neutrality of the people of Edessa by making over to\r\nthem all the coined money that they had carried off in their Syrian\r\nraid. After this it would seem that the retreat was unmolested, and\r\nSapor succeeded in conveying the greater part of his army, together with\r\nhis illustrious prisoner, to his own country.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the treatment that Valerian received at the hands of his\r\nconqueror it is difficult to form a decided opinion. The writers nearest\r\nto the time speak vaguely and moderately, merely telling us that he grew\r\nold in his captivity and was kept in the condition of a slave. It is\r\nreserved for authors of the next generation to inform us that he was\r\nexposed to the constant gaze of the multitude, fettered, but clad in the\r\nimperial purple; and that Sapor, whenever he mounted on horseback,\r\nplaced his foot upon his prisoner's neck. Some add that when the\r\nunhappy captive died, about the year A.D. 265 or 266, his body was\r\nflayed and the skin inflated and hung up to view in one of the most\r\nfrequented temples of Persia, where it was seen by Roman envoys on their\r\nvisits to the great king's court.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny that oriental barbarism may conceivably have\r\ngone to these lengths; and it is in favor of the truth of the details\r\nthat Roman vanity would naturally have been opposed to their invention.\r\nBut, on the other hand, we have to remember that in the East the person\r\nof a king is generally regarded as sacred, and that self-interest\r\nrestrains the conquering monarch from dishonoring one of his own class.\r\nWe have also to give due weight to the fact that the earlier authorities\r\nare silent with respect to any such atrocities, and that they are first\r\nrelated half a century after the time when they are said to have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the scepticism of Gibbon with respect to them\r\nis perhaps worthy of commendation.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that oriental monarchs, when they are cruel, do not show\r\nthemselves ashamed of their cruelties, but usually relate them openly in\r\ntheir inscriptions or represent them in their bas-reliefs. The remains\r\nascribed on good grounds to Sapor do not, however, contain anything\r\nconfirmatory of the stories which we are considering. Valerian is\r\nrepresented on them in a humble attitude, but not fettered, and never in\r\nthe posture of extreme degradation commonly associated with his name. He\r\nbends his knee, as no doubt he would be required to do, on being brought\r\ninto the great king's presence; but otherwise he does not appear to be\r\nsubjected to any indignity. It seems thus to be on the whole most\r\nprobable that the Roman Emperor was not more severely treated than the\r\ngenerality of captive princes, and that Sapor has been unjustly taxed\r\nwith abusing the rights of conquest.\r\n\r\nThe hostile feeling of Odenathus against Sapor did not cease with the\r\nretreat of the latter across the Euphrates. The Palmyrene prince was\r\nbent on taking advantage of the general confusion of the times to carve\r\nout for himself a considerable kingdom, of which Palmyra should be the\r\ncapital. Syria and Palestine, on the one hand, Mesopotamia, on the\r\nother, were the provinces that lay most conveniently near to him and\r\nthat he especially coveted. But Mesopotamia had remained in the\r\npossession of the Persians as the prize of their victory over Valerian,\r\nand could only be obtained by wresting it from the hands into which it\r\nhad fallen. Odenathus did not shrink from this contest. It has been,\r\nwith some reason, conjectured that Sapor must have been at this time\r\noccupied with troubles which had broken out on the eastern side of his\r\nempire. At any rate, it appears that Odenathus, after a short contest\r\nwith Macrianus and his son, Quietus, turned his arms once more, about\r\nA.D. 263, against the Persians, crossed the Euphrates into Mesopotamia,\r\ntook Carrhæ and Nisibis, defeated Sapor and some of his sons in a\r\nbattle, and drove the entire Persian host in confusion to the gates of\r\nCtesiphon. He even returned to lay siege to that city; but it was not\r\nlong before effectual relief arrived; from all the provinces flocked in\r\ncontingents for the defence of the western capital; several engagements\r\nwere fought, in some of which Odenathus was defeated; and at last he\r\nfound himself involved in difficulties through his ignorance of the\r\nlocalities, and so thought it best to retire. Apparently his retreat was\r\nundisturbed; he succeeded in carrying off his booty and his prisoners,\r\namong whom were several satraps, and he retained possession of\r\nMesopotamia, which continued to form a part of the Palmyrene kingdom\r\nuntil the capture of Zenobia by Aurelian, A.D. 273.\r\n\r\nThe successes of Odenathus, in A.D. 263, were followed by a period of\r\ncomparative tranquillity. That ambitious prince seems to have been\r\ncontent with ruling from the Tigris to the Mediterranean, and with the\r\ntitle of \"Augustus,\" which he received from the Roman emperor Gallienus,\r\nand \"King of Kings,\" which he assumed upon his coins. He did not press\r\nfurther upon Sapor, nor did the Roman Emperor make any serious attempt\r\nto recover his father's person or revenge his defeat upon the Persians.\r\nAn expedition which he sent out to the East, professedly with this\r\nobject, in the year A.D. 267, failed utterly, its commander,\r\nHeraclianus, being signally defeated by Zenobia, the widow and successor\r\nof Odenathus. Odenathus himself was murdered by a kinsman three or four\r\nyears after his great successes, and though Zenobia ruled his kingdom\r\nalmost with a man's vigor, the removal of his powerful adversary must\r\nhave been felt as a relief by the Persian monarch. It is evident, too,\r\nthat from the time of the accession of Zenobia the relations between\r\nRome and Palmyra had become unfriendly; the old empire grew jealous of\r\nthe new kingdom which had sprung up upon its borders; and the effect of\r\nthis jealousy, while it lasted, was to secure Persia from any attack on\r\nthe part of either.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Sapor, relieved from any further necessity of defending\r\nhis empire in arms, employed the remaining years of his life in the\r\nconstruction of great works, and especially in the erection and\r\nornamentation of a new capital. The ruins of Shapur, which still exist\r\nnear Kazerun, in the province of Fars, commemorate the name and afford\r\nsome indication of the grandeur of the second Persian monarch. Besides\r\nremains of buildings, they comprise a number of bas-reliefs and rock\r\ninscriptions, some of which were, beyond a doubt, set up by Sapor I. In\r\none of the most remarkable, the Persian monarch is represented on\r\nhorseback, wearing the crown usual upon his coins, and holding by the\r\nhand a tunicked figure, probably Miriades, whom he is presenting to the\r\ncaptured Romans as their sovereign. Foremost to do him homage is the\r\nkneeling figure of a chieftain, probably Valerian, behind whom are\r\narranged in a double line seventeen persons, representing probably the\r\ndifferent corps of the Roman army. All these persons are on foot, while\r\nin contrast with them are arranged behind Sapor ten guards on horseback,\r\nwho represent his irresistible cavalry. Another bas-relief at the same\r\nplace gives us a general view of Sapor on his return to Persia with his\r\nillustrious prisoners. Here fifty-seven guards are ranged behind him,\r\nwhile in front are thirty-three tribute bearers having with them an\r\nelephant and a chariot. In the centre is a group of seven figures,\r\ncomprising: Sapor, who is on horseback in his usual costume; Valerian,\r\nwho is under the horse's feet; Miriades, who stands by Sapor's side;\r\nthree principal tribute bearers in front of the main figure; and a\r\n_Victory_, which floats in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnother important work, assigned by tradition to Sapor I, is the great\r\ndike at Shuster. This is a dam across the river Karun, formed of cut\r\nstones, cemented by lime and fastened together by cramps of iron; it is\r\ntwenty feet broad and no less than twelve hundred feet in length. The\r\nwhole is a solid mass except in the centre, where two small arches have\r\nbeen constructed for the purpose of allowing a part of the stream to\r\nflow in its natural bed. The greater portion of the water is directed\r\neastward into a canal cut for it; and the town of Shuster is thus\r\ndefended on both sides by a water barrier, whereby the position becomes\r\none of great strength. Tradition says that Sapor used his power over\r\nValerian to obtain Roman engineers for this work; and the great dam is\r\nstill known as the \"Dam of Cæsar\" to the inhabitants of the neighboring\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSapor died, having reigned thirty-one years, from A.D. 240 to A.D. 271.\r\nHe was undoubtedly one of the most remarkable princes of the Sassanian\r\nseries. In military talent, indeed, he may not have equalled his father,\r\nfor though he defeated Valerian he had to confess himself inferior to\r\nOdenathus. But in general governmental ability he is among the foremost\r\nof the Neo-Persian monarchs, and may compare favorably with almost any\r\nprince of the series. He baffled Odenathus, when he was not able to\r\ndefeat him, by placing himself behind walls, and by bringing into play\r\nthose advantages which naturally belonged to the position of a monarch\r\nattacked in his own country. He maintained, if he did not permanently\r\nadvance, the power of Persia in the West, while in the East it is\r\nprobable that he considerably extended the bounds of his dominion.\r\n\r\nTo the internal administration of his empire he united works of\r\nusefulness with the construction of memorials which had only a\r\nsentimental and æsthetic value. He was a liberal patron of art and is\r\nthought not to have confined his patronage to the encouragement of\r\nnative talent. On the subject of religion he did not suffer himself to\r\nbe permanently led away by the enthusiasm of a young and bold\r\nfreethinker. He decided to maintain the religious system that had\r\ndescended to him from his ancestors, and turned a deaf ear to\r\npersuasions that would have led him to revolutionize the religious\r\nopinion of the East without placing it upon a satisfactory footing. The\r\norientals add to these commendable features of character that he was a\r\nman of remarkable beauty, of great personal courage, and of a noble and\r\nprincely liberality. According to them, \"he only desired wealth that he\r\nmight use it for good and great purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF CONSTANTINE\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF PAGANISM\r\n\r\nA.D. 300-337\r\n\r\nJOHANN LORENZ VON MOSHEIM\r\n\r\n     A new epoch in the history of the Roman Empire began with the\r\n     accession of Diocletian to the throne in A.D. 284. From that time\r\n     the old names of consul, tribune, etc., belonging to the republic\r\n     lost their significance, and even the senate was practically\r\n     abolished. Thenceforth the empire became an oriental sovereignty.\r\n     In the year 292, having previously associated with himself one\r\n     colleague, Maximianus Herculius, Diocletian created two Cæsars: the\r\n     one, Galerius Maximianus, to act as his subordinate in the East;\r\n     the other, Constantius Chlorus, to divide the government of the\r\n     western provinces with Maximianus Herculius. Each of these emperors\r\n     ruled with vigor in his own territory, defending the frontiers of\r\n     the empire and also suppressing such revolts as broke out within\r\n     its borders.\r\n\r\n     But these transformations in the empire were preparing the way for\r\n     events of unprecedented nature and importance, and for the rise of\r\n     an emperor destined to play a part in the history of the world\r\n     quite different from that performed by any of his predecessors.\r\n     This was Constantine, in whose character, throughout his life,\r\n     opposing elements seemed to contend for mastery, as was shown in\r\n     his treatment of the perplexing questions that arose during his\r\n     reign concerning Christianity, which was persecuted under\r\n     Diocletian and the old Roman religion. Of his statesmanship and his\r\n     further transformation of the empire, in ways which Diocletian\r\n     could not have foreseen, history has made an impressive record.\r\n\r\n     But the great events of his reign, which caused it to be regarded\r\n     as the inauguration of a new era, were his conversion to\r\n     Christianity and the acts whereby he secured its toleration and\r\n     then its supremacy in the empire. In the account which follows it\r\n     is clearly shown by what steps these results were attained, and how\r\n     the work of Constantine the Great became the chief agency by which\r\n     Christianity mounted the throne of the Cæsars.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the fourth century the Roman Empire had four\r\nsovereigns, of whom two were superior to the others and bore the title\r\nof Augustus, namely, Diocletian and Maximianus Herculius; the two\r\ninferior sovereigns, who bore the title of Cæsars, were Constantius\r\nChlorus and Galerius Maximianus. Under these four emperors the state of\r\nthe Church was peaceful and happy. Diocletian, though superstitious,\r\nindulged no hatred toward the Christians. Constantius Chlorus, following\r\nonly the dictates of reason in matters of religion, was averse to the\r\npopular idolatry, and friendly to the Christians. The pagan priests,\r\ntherefore, from well-grounded fears lest Christianity, to their great\r\nand lasting injury, should spread far and wide its triumphs, endeavored\r\nto excite Diocletian, whom they knew to be both timid and credulous, by\r\nmeans of feigned oracles and other impositions, to engage in persecuting\r\nthe Christians.\r\n\r\nThese artifices not succeeding very well, they made use of the other\r\nemperor, Galerius Maximianus, who was son-in-law to Diocletian, in order\r\nto effect their purpose. This Emperor, who was of a ferocious character\r\nand ill-informed in everything except the military art, continued to\r\nwork upon his father-in-law, being urged on partly by his own\r\ninclination, partly by the instigation of his mother, a most\r\nsuperstitious woman, and partly by that of the pagan priests, till at\r\nlast, when Diocletian was at Nicomedia, in the year 303, he obtained\r\nfrom him an edict by which the temples of the Christians were to be\r\ndemolished, their sacred books committed to the flames, and themselves\r\ndeprived of all their civil rights and honors. This first edict spared\r\nthe lives of the Christians; for Diocletian was averse from slaughter\r\nand bloodshed. Yet it caused many Christians to be put to death,\r\nparticularly those who refused to deliver up their sacred books to the\r\nmagistrates. Seeing this operation of the law, many Christians, and\r\nseveral even of the bishops and clergy, in order to save their lives,\r\nvoluntarily surrendered the sacred books in their possession. But they\r\nwere regarded by their more resolute brethren as guilty of sacrilege.\r\n\r\nNot long after the publication of this first edict, there were two\r\nconflagrations in the palace of Nicomedia; and the enemies of the\r\nChristians persuaded Diocletian to believe that Christian hands had\r\nkindled them. He therefore ordered many Christians of Nicomedia to be\r\nput to the torture and to undergo the penalties due to incendiaries.\r\nNearly at the same time there were insurrections in Armenia and in\r\nSyria; and as their enemies charged the blame of these also upon the\r\nChristians, the Emperor by a new edict ordered all bishops and ministers\r\nof Christ to be thrown into prison; and by a third edict, soon after, he\r\nordered that all these prisoners should be compelled by tortures and\r\npunishments to offer sacrifice to the gods; for he hoped, if the bishops\r\nand teachers were once brought to submission, the Christian churches\r\nwould follow their example. A great multitude, therefore, of excellent\r\nmen, in every part of the Roman Empire, Gaul only excepted, which was\r\nsubject to Constantius Chlorus, were either punished capitally or\r\ncondemned to the mines.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of the persecution, A.D. 304, Diocletian published a\r\nfourth edict, at the instigation of his son-in-law and other enemies of\r\nthe Christians. By this edict the magistrates were directed to compel\r\nall Christians to offer sacrifices to the gods, and to use tortures for\r\nthat purpose. And as the governors yielded strict obedience to these\r\norders, the Christian Church was reduced to the last extremity. Galerius\r\nMaximianus therefore no longer hesitated to disclose the secret designs\r\nhe had long entertained. He required his father-in-law, Diocletian,\r\ntogether with his colleague, Maximianus Herculius, to divest themselves\r\nof their power, and constituted himself emperor of the East; leaving the\r\nWest to Constantius Chlorus, whose health he knew to be very infirm. He\r\nalso associated with him in the government two assistants of his own\r\nchoosing, namely, Caius Galerius Maximinus, his sister's son, and\r\nFlavius Severus; excluding altogether Constantine, the son of\r\nConstantius Chlorus. This revolution in the Roman Government restored\r\npeace to Christians in the Western provinces, which were under\r\nConstantius; but in the Eastern provinces the persecution raged with\r\ngreater severity than before.\r\n\r\nBut divine Providence frustrated the whole plan of Galerius Maximianus.\r\nFor, Constantius Chlorus dying in Britain, in the year 306, the soldiery\r\nby acclamation made his son Constantine, who afterward by his\r\nachievements obtained the title of \"the Great,\" Augustus or Emperor; and\r\nthe tyrant Galerius was obliged to submit, and even to approve this\r\nadverse event. Soon after a civil war broke out. For Maxentius, the\r\nson-in-law of Galerius Maximianus, being indignant that Galerius should\r\nprefer Severus before him, and invest him with imperial power, himself\r\nassumed the purple, and took his father, Maximianus Herculius, for his\r\ncolleague in the empire. In the midst of these commotions Constantine,\r\nbeyond all expectation, made his way to the imperial throne. The western\r\nChristians, those of Italy and Africa excepted, enjoyed a good degree of\r\ntranquillity and liberty during these civil wars. But the oriental\r\nchurches experienced various fortune, adverse or tolerable, according to\r\nthe political changes from year to year. At length Galerius Maximianus,\r\nwho had been the author of the heaviest calamities, being brought low by\r\na terrific and protracted disease, and finding himself ready to die, in\r\nthe year 311, issued a decree which restored peace to them, after they\r\nhad endured almost unbounded sufferings.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Galerius Maximianus, Caius Galerius Maximianus and\r\nCaius Valerius Licinius divided between themselves the provinces which\r\nhad been governed by Galerius. At the same time Maxentius, who held\r\nAfrica and Italy, determined to make war upon Constantine, who governed\r\nin Spain and Gaul, in order to bring all the West under his authority.\r\nConstantine anticipated his designs, marched his army into Italy in the\r\nyear 312, and in a battle fought at the Milvian bridge, near Rome,\r\nrouted the army of Maxentius. In the flight the bridge broke down, and\r\nMaxentius fell into the Tiber and was drowned. After this victory\r\nConstantine, with his colleague Licinius, immediately gave full liberty\r\nto the Christians of living according to their own institutions and\r\nlaws; and this liberty was more clearly defined the following year, A.D.\r\n313, in a new edict drawn up at Milan. Caius Galerius Maximinus, indeed,\r\nwho reigned in the East, was projecting new calamities for the\r\nChristians, and menacing the emperors of the West with war; but being\r\nvanquished by Licinius, he put an end to his own life, in the year 313,\r\nby swallowing poison, at Tarsus.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Constantine the Great, who was previously a man of no\r\nreligion, is said to have embraced Christianity, being induced thereto\r\nprincipally by the miracle of a cross appearing to him in the heavens.\r\nBut this story is liable to much doubt. His first edict in favor of the\r\nChristians, and many other things, sufficiently evince that he was\r\nindeed at that time well disposed toward the Christians and their\r\nworship, but that he by no means regarded Christianity as the only true\r\nand saving religion; on the contrary, it appears that he regarded other\r\nreligions, and among them the old Roman religion, as likewise true and\r\nuseful to mankind; and he therefore wished all religions to be freely\r\npractised throughout the Roman Empire. But as he advanced in life,\r\nConstantine made progress in religious knowledge, and gradually came to\r\nregard Christianity as the only true and saving religion, and to\r\nconsider all others as false and impious. Having learned this, he now\r\nbegan to exhort his subjects to embrace Christianity; and at length he\r\nproclaimed war against the ancient superstitions. At what time this\r\nchange in the views of the Emperor took place, and he began to look upon\r\nall religions but the Christian as false, cannot be determined. This,\r\nhowever, is certain, that the change in his views was first made\r\nmanifest by his laws and edicts in the year 324, after the death of\r\nLicinius, when Constantine became sole emperor. His purpose, however, of\r\nabolishing the ancient religion of the Romans, and of tolerating only\r\nthe Christian religion, he did not disclose till a little before his\r\ndeath, when he published his edicts for pulling down the pagan temples\r\nand abolishing the sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThat the Emperor was sincere, and not a dissembler, in regard to his\r\nconversion to Christianity, no person can doubt who believes that men's\r\nactions are an index of their real feelings. It is indeed true that\r\nConstantine's life was not such as the precepts of Christianity\r\nrequired; and it is also true that he remained a catechumen all his\r\nlife, and was received to full membership in the Church, by baptism,\r\nonly a few days before his death, at Nicomedia. But neither of these is\r\nadequate proof that the Emperor had not a general conviction of the\r\ntruth of the Christian religion, or that he only feigned himself a\r\nChristian. For in that age many persons deferred baptism till near the\r\nclose of life, that they might pass into the other world altogether pure\r\nand undefiled with sin; and it is but too notorious that many persons\r\nwho look upon the Christian religion as indubitably true and of divine\r\norigin, yet do not conform their lives to all its holy precepts. It is\r\nanother question whether worldly motives might not have contributed in\r\nsome degree to induce Constantine to prefer the Christian religion to\r\nthe ancient Roman, and to all other religions, and to recommend the\r\nobservance of it to his subjects. Indeed, it is no improbable conjecture\r\nthat the Emperor had discernment to see that Christianity possessed\r\ngreat efficacy, and idolatry none at all, to strengthen public\r\nauthority, and to bind citizens to their duty.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the cross, which Constantine most solemnly affirmed he saw\r\nin the heavens, near midday, is a subject involved in the greatest\r\nobscurities and difficulties. It is, however, an easy thing to refute\r\nthose who regard this prodigy as a cunning fiction of the Emperor, or\r\nwho rank it among fables; and also those who refer the phenomenon to\r\nnatural causes, ingeniously conjecturing that the form of a cross\r\nappeared in a solar halo, or in the moon; and likewise those who ascribe\r\nthe transaction to the power of God, who intended by a miracle to\r\nconfirm the wavering faith of the Emperor. Now these suppositions being\r\nrejected, the only conclusion that remains is that Constantine saw, in a\r\ndream while asleep, the appearance of a cross, with the inscription, _In\r\nhoc signo vinces_ (\"By this sign thou shalt conquer\"). Nor is this\r\nopinion unsupported by competent authorities of good credit.\r\n\r\nThe happiness anticipated by the Christians from the edicts of\r\nConstantine and Licinius was a little afterward interrupted by Licinius,\r\nwho waged war against his kinsman Constantine. Being vanquished in the\r\nyear 314, he was quiet for about nine years. But in the year 324 this\r\nrestless man again attacked Constantine, being urged on both by his own\r\ninclination and by the instigation of the pagan priests. That he might\r\nsecure himself a victory, he attached the pagans to his cause by\r\nseverely oppressing the Christians, and putting not a few of their\r\nbishops to death. But all his plans failed; for, after several\r\nunsuccessful battles, he was obliged to throw himself upon the mercy of\r\nthe victor, who, nevertheless, ordered him to be strangled, in the year\r\n325. After his victory over Licinius, Constantine reigned sole emperor\r\ntill his death; and by his plans, his enactments, his regulations, and\r\nhis munificence he endeavored as much as possible to obliterate\r\ngradually the ancient superstitions and to establish Christian worship\r\nthroughout the Roman Empire. He had undoubtedly learned from the wars\r\nand the machinations of Licinius that neither himself nor the Roman\r\nEmpire could remain secure while the ancient superstition continued\r\nprevalent; and therefore, from this time onward, he openly opposed the\r\npagan deities and their worship, as being prejudicial to the interests\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Constantine, which happened in the year 337, his\r\nthree surviving sons, Constantine II, Constantius, and Constans, assumed\r\nthe empire, and were all proclaimed emperors by the Roman senate. There\r\nwere still living two brothers of Constantine the Great, namely,\r\nConstantius Dalmatius and Julius Constans, and they had several sons.\r\nBut nearly all of these were slain by the soldiers at the command of\r\nConstantine's sons, who feared lest their thirst for power might lead\r\nthem to make insurrections and disturb the Commonwealth. Only Gallus and\r\nJulian, sons of Julius Constans, escaped the massacre; and the latter of\r\nthese afterward became emperor. Constantine II held Britain, Gaul, and\r\nSpain, but lost his life, A.D. 340, in a war with his brother Constans,\r\nwho at first governed only Illyricum, Italy, and Africa; but after the\r\nfall of his brother, Constantine II, he annexed his provinces to his\r\nempire, and thus became emperor of all the West, until he lost his life,\r\nA.D. 350, in the war with Maxentius, a usurper. After the death of\r\nConstans, Maxentius being subdued, the third brother, Constantius, who\r\nhad before governed Asia, Syria, and Egypt, in the year 353 became sole\r\nemperor, and governed the whole empire till the year 361, when he died.\r\nNeither of these brothers possessed the disposition or the discernment\r\nof their father; yet they all pursued their father's purpose of\r\nabolishing the ancient superstitions of the Romans and other pagans, and\r\nof propagating the Christian religion throughout the Roman Empire. The\r\nthing itself was commendable and excellent; but in the means employed\r\nthere was much that was censurable.\r\n\r\nRhetoricians and philosophers, whose schools were supposed to be so\r\nprofitable to the community, exhausted all their ingenuity, both before\r\nthe days of Constantine the Great and afterward, to arrest the progress\r\nof Christianity. In the beginning of this century Hierocles, the great\r\nornament of the Platonic school, composed two books against the\r\nChristians, in which he had the audacity to compare our Saviour with\r\nApollonius Tyanæus, and for which he was chastised by Eusebius in a\r\ntract written expressly against him. Lactantius speaks of another\r\nphilosopher who endeavored to convince the Christians they were in\r\nerror; but his name is not mentioned. After the reign of Constantine the\r\nGreat, Julian wrote a large volume against the Christians, and Himerius\r\nand Libanius in their public declamations, and Eunapius in his lives of\r\nthe philosophers, zealously decried the Christian religion. Yet no one\r\nof these persons was punished at all for the licentiousness of his\r\ntongue or of his pen.\r\n\r\nHow much harm these sophists or philosophers, who were full of the pride\r\nof imaginary knowledge and of hatred to the Christian name, did to the\r\ncause of Christianity in this century appears from many examples, and\r\nespecially from the apostasy of Julian, who was seduced by men of this\r\nstamp. Among those who wished to appear wise, and to take moderate\r\nground, many were induced by the arguments and explanations of these men\r\nto devise a kind of reconciling religion, intermediate between the old\r\nsuperstition and Christianity, and to imagine that Christ had enjoined\r\nthe very same thing which had long been represented by the pagan priests\r\nunder the envelope of their ceremonies and fables. Of these views were\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, a very prudent and discreet man; Chalcidius, a\r\nphilosopher; Themistius, a very celebrated orator, and others, who\r\nconceived that both religions were in unison, as to all the more\r\nimportant points, if they were rightly understood, and therefore held\r\nthat Christ was neither to be contemned nor to be honored to the\r\nexclusion of the pagan deities.\r\n\r\nAs Constantine the Great and his sons and successors took much pains to\r\nenlarge the Christian Church, it is not strange that many nations,\r\nbefore barbarous and uncivilized, became subject to Christ. Many\r\ncircumstances make it probable that the light of Christianity cast some\r\nof its rays into both Armenias, the Greater and the Less, soon after the\r\nestablishment of the Christian Church. But the Armenian Church first\r\nreceived due organization and firm establishment in this century; in\r\nthe beginning of which Gregory, the son of Anax, commonly called \"the\r\nIlluminator,\" because he dispelled the mists of superstition which\r\nbeclouded the minds of the Athenians, first persuaded some private\r\nindividuals, and afterward Tiridates, the king of the Armenians, as well\r\nas his nobles, to embrace and observe the Christian religion. He was\r\ntherefore ordained the first bishop of Armenia, by Leontius, bishop of\r\nCappadocia, and gradually diffused the principles of Christianity\r\nthroughout that country.\r\n\r\nIn the European provinces of the Roman Empire there still remained a\r\nvast number of idolaters; and though the Christian bishops endeavored to\r\nconvert them to Christ, the business went on but slowly. In Gaul, the\r\ngreat Martin, bishop of Tours, was not unsuccessful in this work; but\r\ntravelling through the provinces of Gaul, he everywhere persuaded many\r\nto renounce their idols and embrace Christ, and he destroyed their\r\ntemples and threw down their statues. He therefore merited the title\r\n\"Apostle of the Gauls.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that the victories of Constantine the Great, and both\r\nthe fear of punishment and the desire of pleasing the Roman emperors,\r\nwere cogent reasons, in the view of whole nations as well as of\r\nindividuals, for embracing the Christian religion. Yet no person well\r\ninformed in the history of this period will ascribe the extension of\r\nChristianity wholly to these causes. For it is manifest that the\r\nuntiring zeal of the bishops and other holy men, the pure and devout\r\nlives which many of the Christians exhibited, the translations of the\r\nsacred volume, and the excellence of the Christian religion were as\r\nefficient motives with many persons as the arguments from worldly\r\nadvantage and disadvantage were with some others.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Christian Church within the Roman Empire was involved in no\r\nsevere calamities from the times of Constantine the Great onward, except\r\nduring the commotion of Licinius and the short reign of Julian, yet\r\nslight tempests sometimes beat upon them in certain places. Athanaric,\r\nfor instance, a king of the Goths, fiercely assailed for a time that\r\nportion of the Gothic nation which had embraced Christianity. In the\r\nmore remote provinces, also, the adherents to idolatry often defended\r\ntheir hereditary superstitions with the sword, and murdered the\r\nChristians, who in propagating their religion were not always as gentle\r\nor as prudent as they ought to have been. Beyond the limits of the Roman\r\nEmpire, Sapor II, the king of Persia, waged three bloody wars against\r\nthe Christians in his dominions. The first was in the eighteenth year of\r\nhis reign; the second was in the thirtieth year; and the third, which\r\nwas the most cruel and destroyed an immense number of Christians,\r\ncommenced in his thirty-first year, A.D. 330, and lasted forty years, or\r\ntill A.D. 370. Yet religion was not the ostensible cause of this\r\ndreadful persecution, but a suspicion of treasonable practices among the\r\nChristians; for the Magi and the Jews persuaded the King to believe that\r\nall Christians were in the interests of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST NICENE COUNCIL\r\n\r\nRISE AND DECLINE OF ARIANISM\r\n\r\nA.D. 325\r\n\r\nJ. L. VON MOSHEIM     A. P. STANLEY\r\n\r\n     Controversies in the Christian Church concerning the mystery of the\r\n     Trinity began in the second century, prior to which the word\r\n     trinity--a term not found in the Scriptures--had scarcely been used\r\n     in Christian writings. It was prominently introduced by theologians\r\n     of the second century, who employed new metaphysical methods in\r\n     their attempts to explain the divine nature. The dispute turned\r\n     upon the questions whether Christ was God or man or an intermediate\r\n     being, whether or not he was created, and like inquiries. Arius, a\r\n     deacon of Alexandria, early in the fourth century, held that Christ\r\n     was a created being, though superior to all other created beings.\r\n     The Son, he maintained, is of a nature similar to--not the same\r\n     as--that of the Father, to whom the Son is subordinate. This heresy\r\n     obtained such currency in the Church that, in 321, a provincial\r\n     synod at Alexandria excommunicated Arius, who in his learned\r\n     writings had set them forth since 318. Once started among the\r\n     people, the controversy begun in the schools became very bitter,\r\n     and in many of the churches partisans of the heretical view\r\n     equalled in number those of the orthodox. Meanwhile Arius continued\r\n     to publish his doctrines.\r\n\r\n     The emperor Constantine, having become the patron of Christianity,\r\n     conceived that the controversy might be settled by an assembly of\r\n     the whole Church, and in the year 325 he convoked the first council\r\n     of Nicæa, which was also the first ecumenical or general council.\r\n     At this council, before which Arius defended his views, over three\r\n     hundred bishops were in attendance, and pronounced in favor of the\r\n     orthodox doctrine--that of the equality of the Son with the\r\n     Father--and condemned the Arians to exile and their books to be\r\n     burned. This council also promulgated the Nicene Creed in its early\r\n     form. The chief opponent of the Arians was Athanasius, the \"Father\r\n     of Orthodoxy,\" whose name was given to a modified creed later\r\n     adopted into the Greek, Roman, and English services. The Arian\r\n     heresy, however, continued to spread in the East, and had the\r\n     strong support of Constantine and his son Constantius. The\r\n     controversy was renewed again and again, and for a long time\r\n     Arianism was an important factor in theological and political\r\n     affairs. Some phases of its peculiar doctrine have reappeared in\r\n     various teachings and sects of modern times. But the orthodox\r\n     doctrine affirmed at Nicæa has prevailed in the great branches of\r\n     the Christian Church, and the acceptance of its fundamental\r\n     principle--that of the Incarnation--in the post-apostolic age was\r\n     destined to have an incalculable influence upon the development of\r\n     individual and national life, civil as well as religious,\r\n     throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHANN LORENZ VON MOSHEIM\r\n\r\nIn the year 317 a storm arose in Egypt which spread its ravages over the\r\nwhole Christian world. The ground of this controversy was the doctrine\r\nof three persons in the Godhead, which during the three preceding\r\ncenturies had not been in all respects defined. The doctors explained\r\nthis subject in different ways, and gave various representations of the\r\ndifference between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, without offence\r\nbeing taken.\r\n\r\nAlexander, the bishop of Alexandria--it is uncertain on what\r\noccasion--expressed himself very freely on this subject in a meeting of\r\nhis presbyters, and maintained, among other things, that the Son\r\npossesses not only the same dignity as the Father, but also the same\r\nessence. But Arius, one of the presbyters, a man of an acute mind and\r\nfluent, at first denied the truth of Alexander's positions, on the\r\nground that they were allied to the Sabellian errors, which were\r\ncondemned by the Church; and then, going to the opposite extreme, he\r\nmaintained that the Son is totally and essentially distinct from the\r\nFather; that he was only the first and noblest of those created beings\r\nwhom God the Father formed out of nothing, and the instrument which the\r\nFather used in creating the material universe, and therefore that he was\r\ninferior to the Father both in nature and in dignity. No one of the\r\nancients has left us a connected and systematic account of the religion\r\nprofessed by Arius and his associates.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of Arius were no sooner divulged than they found very many\r\nabettors, and among them men of distinguished talents and rank, both in\r\nEgypt and the neighboring provinces. Alexander, on the other hand,\r\naccused Arius of blasphemy before two councils assembled at Alexandria,\r\nand cast him out of the Church. He was not discouraged by this disgrace;\r\nbut retiring to Palestine he wrote various letters to men of\r\ndistinction, in which he labored to demonstrate the truth of his\r\ndoctrines, and with so much success that he drew over immense numbers to\r\nhis side, and in particular Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, who was a man\r\nof vast influence. The emperor Constantine, who considered the\r\ndiscussion as relating to a matter of little importance and remote from\r\nthe fundamentals of religion, at first addressed the disputants by\r\nletter, admonishing them to desist from contention. But when he found\r\nthat nothing was effected by this measure, and that greater commotion\r\nwas daily rising throughout the empire, he in the year 325 summoned that\r\nfamous council of the whole Church which met at Nice in Bithynia, to put\r\nan end to this controversy. In this council, after various altercations\r\nand conflicts of the bishops, the doctrine of Arius was condemned,\r\nChrist was pronounced to be of the same essence with the Father, Arius\r\nwas sent into exile in Illyricum, and his followers were compelled to\r\nassent to a creed or confession of faith composed by the council.\r\n\r\nNo part of church history, perhaps, has acquired more celebrity than\r\nthis assembly of bishops at Nice to settle the affairs of the Church;\r\nand yet it is very singular that scarcely any part of ecclesiastical\r\nhistory has been investigated and explained more negligently. The\r\nancient writers are not agreed as to the time and year, nor the place,\r\nnor the number of the judges, nor the president of this council, nor as\r\nto many other particulars. No written journal of the proceedings of this\r\nvenerable tribunal was kept--at least none has reached us. How many and\r\nwhat canons or ecclesiastical laws were enacted is not agreed on by the\r\nEastern and Western Christians. The latter tell us they were only twenty\r\nin number, but the orientals make them far more numerous. From the\r\ncanons universally received, and from the other monuments of the\r\ncouncil, it appears not only that Arius was condemned, but that other\r\nthings were decreed, with a view to settle the affairs of the Church. In\r\nparticular, the controversy respecting the time of celebrating Easter,\r\nwhich had long perplexed Christians, was terminated; the jurisdiction of\r\nthe greater bishops was defined, and several other matters of a like\r\nnature were determined.\r\n\r\nBut the passions of men were more efficient than either the decrees of\r\nthe Nicene Council or the authority of the Emperor; for there were those\r\nwho, though they did not fall in with the doctrine of Arius, yet were\r\ndissatisfied with some things in the decrees and the creed of the\r\ncouncil, and the Arians left no means untried to free themselves from\r\nthe evils inflicted on them by those decrees. And the issue was\r\nfavorable to their wishes; for in a few years after the Nicene Council\r\nan Arian presbyter whom Constantia, the Emperor's sister, at her death\r\nhad recommended to the care of her brother, succeeded in persuading\r\nConstantine the Great that Arius had been wrongfully condemned from\r\npersonal enmity. Accordingly, in the year 330, the Emperor recalled\r\nArius from exile, rescinded the decrees passed against his associates\r\nand friends, and permitted Eusebius of Nicomedia, the principal\r\nsupporter of Arius, and his powerful faction, now thirsting for revenge,\r\nto persecute the defenders of the Nicene Council. They assailed no one\r\nmore fiercely than Athanasius, the bishop of Alexandria. When he could\r\nin no way be brought to restore Arius to his former honors and\r\necclesiastical standing, Athanasius was first deprived of his office, in\r\na council held at Tyre, A.D. 335, and then banished to Gaul, while in\r\nthe same year, by a numerous council held at Jerusalem, Arius and his\r\nfriends were solemnly admitted to the communion of the Church. But by\r\nnone of these proceedings could the Alexandrians be induced to receive\r\nArius among their presbyters. Accordingly the Emperor called him to\r\nConstantinople, in the year 336, and ordered Alexander, the bishop of\r\nthat city, to open the doors of his church to him. But before that could\r\ntake place Arius died at Constantinople in a tragical manner;[49] and\r\nthe Emperor himself closed life shortly after.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Constantine the Great, one of his sons, Constantius,\r\nthe Emperor of the East, with his wife and his court, was very partial\r\nto the Arian cause, but Constantine and Constans supported in the\r\nwestern parts, where they governed, the decisions of the Nicene Council.\r\nHence the broils, the commotions, the plots, the injuries had neither\r\nmeasure nor bounds, and on both sides councils were assembled to oppose\r\ncouncils. Constans died in the year 350, and two years afterward a great\r\npart of the West, particularly Italy and Rome, came under the dominion\r\nof his brother Constantius. This revolution was most disastrous to the\r\nfriends of the Nicene Council; for this Emperor, being devoted to the\r\nArians, involved the others in numerous evils and calamities, and by\r\nthreats and punishments compelled many of them to apostatize to that\r\nsect to which he was himself attached. The Nicene party made no\r\nhesitation to return the same treatment as soon as time, place, and\r\nopportunity were afforded them, and the history of Christianity under\r\nConstantius presents the picture of a most stormy period, and of a war\r\namong brethren which was carried on without religion or justice or\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Constantius, in the year 362, the prosperous days of the\r\nArians were at an end. Julian had no partiality for either, and\r\ntherefore patronized neither the Arians nor the orthodox. Jovian\r\nespoused the orthodox sentiments, and therefore all the West, with no\r\nsmall part of the East, rejecting Arian views, reverted to the doctrines\r\nof the Nicene Council. But the scene was changed under the two brothers\r\nValentinian and Valens, who were advanced to the government of the\r\nEmpire in the year 364. Valentinian adhered to the decisions at Nice,\r\nand therefore in the West the Arian sect, a few churches excepted, was\r\nwholly extirpated. Valens, on the contrary, took sides with the Arians,\r\nand hence in the eastern provinces many calamities befell the orthodox.\r\nBut when this Emperor had fallen in a war with the Goths, A.D. 378,\r\nGratian--who succeeded Valentinian in the West, in the year 376, and\r\nbecame master of the whole empire in 378--restored peace to the\r\northodox. After him Theodosius the Great, by depriving the Arians of all\r\ntheir churches and enacting severe laws against them, caused the\r\ndecisions of the Nicene Council to triumph everywhere, and none could\r\nany longer publicly profess Arian doctrines except among the barbarous\r\nnations, the Goths, the Vandals, and the Burgundians. That there were\r\ngreat faults on both sides in this long and violent contest no candid\r\nperson can deny, but which party was guilty of the greatest wrong it is\r\ndifficult to say.\r\n\r\nThe Arians would have done much more harm to the Church if they had not\r\nbecome divided among themselves, after the Nicene Council, and split\r\ninto sects which could not endure each other. Unhappily the Arian\r\ncontests produced, as was very natural, some new sects. Some persons,\r\nwhile eager to avoid and to confute the opinions of Arius, fell into\r\nopinions equally dangerous. Others, after treading in the footsteps of\r\nArius, ventured on far beyond him and became still greater errorists.\r\nThe human mind, weak and subject to the control of the senses and the\r\nimagination, seldom exerts all its energies to comprehend divine\r\nsubjects in such a manner as to be duly guarded against extremes. In the\r\nformer class I would reckon Apollinaris the Younger, bishop of Laodicea,\r\nthough otherwise a man of great merit, and one who in various ways\r\nrendered important service to the Church. He manfully asserted the\r\ndivinity of Christ against the Arians, but by philosophizing too freely\r\nand too eagerly he almost set aside the human nature of the Saviour.\r\nThis great man was led astray, not merely by the ardor of debate, but\r\nlikewise by his immoderate attachment to the Platonic doctrine\r\nconcerning a twofold soul, from which if the divines of the age had been\r\nfree they would have formed more wise and more correct judgments on many\r\npoints. The doctrine of Apollinaris met the approbation of many in\r\nnearly all the eastern provinces, and, being explained in different\r\nways, it became a source of new sects. But as it was assailed by the\r\nlaws of the emperors, the decrees of councils, and the writings of\r\nlearned men, it gradually sunk under these united assaults.\r\n\r\nAt the head of those whom the contests with Arius led into still greater\r\nerrors may undoubtedly be placed Photinus, bishop of Sirmium, who in the\r\nyear 343 advanced opinions concerning God equally remote from those of\r\nthe orthodox and those of the Arians. The temerity of the man was\r\nchastened not only by the orthodox, in their councils of Antioch in 345,\r\nof Milan in 347, and of Sirmium, but also by the Arians in a council\r\nheld at Sirmium in 351. He was deprived of his office, and died in\r\nexile in the year 372. After him Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, a\r\ndistinguished semi-Arian teacher, being deprived of his office by the\r\nCouncil of Constantinople, in the year 360, in his exile founded the\r\nsect of the Pneumatomachi. He openly professed that the Holy Spirit is a\r\ndivine energy diffused throughout the universe, and not a person\r\ndistinct from the Father and the Son. This doctrine was embraced by many\r\nin the Asiatic provinces; but the Council of Constantinople, assembled\r\nby Theodosius the Great, in the year 381, and which is commonly\r\nconsidered as the second ecumenical council, early dissipated by its\r\nauthority this young and immature sect. One hundred and fifty bishops\r\npresent in this council defined fully and perfectly the doctrine of\r\nthree persons and one God, as it is still professed by the great body of\r\nChristians, which the Nicene Council had only in part performed. They\r\nalso anathematized all the heresies then known.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century the Arians, oppressed and persecuted by the\r\nimperial edicts, took refuge among those barbarous nations who gradually\r\noverturned the Roman Empire in the West; and found among the Goths,\r\nHeruli, Suevi, Vandals, and Burgundians a fixed residence and a quiet\r\nretreat. Being now safe, they treated the orthodox with the same\r\nviolence which the orthodox had employed against them and other\r\nheretics, and had no hesitation about persecuting the adherents to the\r\nNicene doctrines in a variety of ways. The Vandals, who had established\r\ntheir kingdom in Africa, surpassed all the rest in cruelty and\r\ninjustice. At first Genseric, their king, and then Huneric, his son,\r\ndemolished the temples of such Christians as maintained the divinity of\r\nthe Saviour, sent their bishops into exile, mutilated many of the more\r\nfirm and decided, and tortured them in various ways; and they expressly\r\nstated that they were authorized to do so by the example of the\r\nemperors, who had enacted similar laws against the Donatists in Africa,\r\nthe Arians, and others who dissented from them in religion.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixth century the Arians were triumphant in some\r\nparts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not a few of the Asiatic bishops\r\nfavored them. The Vandals in Africa, the Goths in Italy, many of the\r\nGauls, the Suevi, the Burgundians, and the Spaniards openly espoused\r\ntheir interests. The Greeks indeed, who approved of the Nicene Council,\r\noppressed and also punished them wherever they were able; but the Arians\r\nreturned the like treatment, especially in Africa and Italy. Yet this\r\nprosperity of the Arians wholly terminated when, under the auspices of\r\nJustinian, the Vandals were driven from Africa and the Goths from Italy.\r\nFor the other Arian kings, Sigismund, king of the Burgundians,\r\nTheodimir, king of the Suevi in Lusitania, and Receared, king of Spain,\r\nwithout violence and war, suffered themselves to be led to a\r\nrenunciation of the Arian doctrine, and to efforts for its extirpation\r\namong their subjects by means of legal enactments and councils. Whether\r\nreason and arguments or hope and fear had the greater influence in the\r\nconversion of these kings, it is difficult to say; but it is certain\r\nthat the Arian sect was from this time dispersed and could never after\r\nrecover any strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY\r\n\r\nThe delegates to the council assembled in the first instance in one of\r\nthe chief buildings of Nicæa, apparently for the purpose of a\r\nthanksgiving and a religious reunion. Whether it was an actual church\r\nmay be questioned. Christians, no doubt, there had been in Bithynia for\r\nsome generations. Already in the second century Pliny had found them in\r\nsuch numbers that the temples were deserted and the sacrifices\r\nneglected. But it would seem that on this occasion a secular building\r\nwas fitted up as a temporary house of prayer. At least the traditional\r\naccount of the place where their concluding prayers were held exactly\r\nagrees with Strabo's account of the ancient gymnasium of Nicæa.\r\n\r\nIt was a large building, shaped like a basilica, with an apsis at one\r\nend, planted in the centre of the town, and thus commanding down each of\r\nthe four streets a view of the four gates, and therefore called\r\n_Mesomphalos_, the \"Navel\" of the city. Whether, however, this edifice\r\nactually was a church or not, its use as such on this occasion served as\r\na precedent for most of the later councils. From the time of the Council\r\nof Chalcedon, they have usually been held within the walls of churches.\r\nBut for this the first council, the church, so far as it was a church,\r\nwas only used as the beginning and the end. After these thanksgivings\r\nwere over, the members of the assembly must have been collected\r\naccording to the divisions which shall now be described.\r\n\r\nThe group which, above the rest, attracts our attention, is the\r\ndeputation from the Church of Egypt. Shrill above all other voices,\r\nvehement above all other disputants, \"brandishing their arguments,\" as\r\nit was described by one who knew them well, \"like spears, against those\r\nwho sate under the same roof and ate off the same table as themselves,\"\r\nwere the combatants from Alexandria, who had brought to its present pass\r\nthe question which the council was called to decide. Foremost in the\r\ngroup in dignity, though not in importance or in energy, was the aged\r\nAlexander, whose imprudent sermon had provoked the quarrel, and whose\r\nsubsequent vacillation had encouraged it. He was the bishop, not indeed\r\nof the first, but of the most learned, see of Christendom. He was known\r\nby a title which he alone officially bore in that assembly. He was \"the\r\nPope.\" \"The Pope of Rome\" was a phrase which had not yet emerged in\r\nhistory. But \"Pope of Alexandria\" was a well-known dignity. _Papa_, that\r\nstrange and universal mixture of familiar endearment and of reverential\r\nawe, extended in a general sense to all Greek presbyters and all Latin\r\nbishops, was the special address which, long before the name of\r\npatriarch or of archbishop, was given to the head of the Alexandrian\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn the Patriarchal Treasury at Moscow is a very ancient scarf or\r\n_omophorion_, said to have been given by the bishop of Nicæa in the\r\nseventeenth century to the czar Alexis, and to have been left to the\r\nChurch of Nicæa by Alexander of Alexandria. It is white, and is rudely\r\nworked with a representation of the Ascension; possibly an allusion to\r\nthe first Sunday of their meeting. This relic, true or false, is the\r\nnearest approach we can now make to the bodily presence of the old\r\ntheologian. The shadow of death is already upon him; in a few months he\r\nwill be beyond the reach of controversy.\r\n\r\nBut close beside the pope Alexander is a small insignificant young man,\r\nof hardly twenty-five years of age, of lively manners and speech, and of\r\nbright, serene countenance. Though he is but the deacon, the chief\r\ndeacon, or archdeacon, of Alexander, he has closely riveted the\r\nattention of the assembly by the vehemence of his arguments. He is\r\nalready taking the words out of the bishop's mouth, and briefly acting\r\nin reality the part he had before, as a child, acted in name, and that\r\nin a few months he will be called to act both in name and in reality. In\r\nsome of the conventional pictures of the council his humble rank as a\r\ndeacon does not allow of his appearance. But his activity and prominence\r\nbehind the scenes made enemies for him there, who will never leave him\r\nthrough life. Anyone who had read his passionate invectives afterward\r\nmay form some notion of what he was when in the thick of his youthful\r\nbattles. That small, insignificant deacon is the great Athanasius.\r\n\r\nNext after the pope and deacon of Alexandria we must turn to one of its\r\nmost important presbyters--the parish priest of its principal church,\r\nwhich bore the name of Baucalis, and marked the first beginnings of what\r\nwe should call a parochial system. In appearance he is the very opposite\r\nof Athanasius. He is sixty years of age, very tall and thin, and\r\napparently unable to support his stature; he has an odd way of\r\ncontorting and twisting himself, which his enemies compare to the\r\nwrigglings of a snake. He would be handsome but for the emaciation and\r\ndeadly pallor of his face, and a downcast look, imparted by a weakness\r\nof eyesight. At times his veins throb and swell and his limbs tremble,\r\nas if suffering from some violent internal complaint--the same, perhaps,\r\nthat will terminate one day in his sudden and frightful death. There is\r\na wild look about him, which at first sight is startling. His dress and\r\ndemeanor are those of a rigid ascetic. He wears a long coat with short\r\nsleeves, and a scarf of only half size, such as was the mark of an\r\naustere life; and his hair hangs in a tangled mass over his head. He is\r\nusually silent, but at times breaks out into fierce excitement, such as\r\nwill give the impression of madness. Yet with all this there are a\r\nsweetness in his voice and a winning, earnest manner which fascinates\r\nthose who come across him. Among the religious ladies of Alexandria he\r\nis said to have had from the first a following of not less than seven\r\nhundred. This strange, captivating, moon-struck giant is the heretic\r\nArius, or, as his adversaries called him, the madman of Ares or Mars.\r\nClose beside him was a group of his countrymen, of whom we know little,\r\nexcept their fidelity to him through good report and evil: Saras, like\r\nhimself a presbyter, from the Libyan province; Euzoius, a deacon of\r\nEgypt; Achillas, a reader; Theonas, bishop of Marmarica in the\r\nCyrenaica; and Secundus, bishop of Ptolemais in the Delta.\r\n\r\nThese were the most remarkable deputies from the Church of Alexandria.\r\nBut from the interior of Egypt came characters of quite another stamp;\r\nnot Greeks, nor Grecized Egyptians, but genuine Copts, speaking the\r\nGreek language not at all, or with great difficulty; living half or the\r\nwhole of their lives in the desert; their very names taken from the\r\nheathen gods of the times of the ancient Pharaohs. One was Potammon,\r\nbishop of Heracleopolis, far up the Nile; the other, Paphnutius, bishop\r\nof the Upper Thebaid. Both are famous for the austerity of their lives.\r\nPotammon--that is, \"dedicated to Ammon\"--had himself visited the hermit\r\nAntony; Paphnutius--that is, \"dedicated to his God\"--had been brought up\r\nin a hermitage. Both, too, had suffered in the persecutions. Each\r\npresented the frightful spectacle of the right eye dug out with iron.\r\nPaphnutius, besides, came limping on one leg, his left having been\r\nhamstrung.\r\n\r\nNext in importance must be reckoned the bishop of Syria and of the\r\ninterior of Asia; or, as they are sometimes called in the later\r\ncouncils, the _Eastern_ bishops, as distinguished from the Church of\r\nEgypt. Then, as afterward, there was a rivalry between those branches of\r\noriental Christendom; each, from long neighborhood, knowing each, yet\r\neach tending in an opposite direction till, after the Council of\r\nChalcedon, a community of heresy drew them together again. Here, as in\r\nEgypt, we find two classes of representatives--scholars from the more\r\ncivilized cities of Syria; wild ascetics from the remoter East. The\r\nfirst in dignity was the orthodox Eustathius, who either was, or was on\r\nthe point of being made, bishop of the capital of Syria, the metropolis\r\nof the Eastern Church, Antioch, then called \"the city of God.\" He had\r\nsuffered in heathen persecutions, and was destined to suffer in\r\nChristian persecutions also. But he was chiefly known for his learning\r\nand eloquence, which was distinguished by an antique simplicity of\r\nstyle. One work alone has come down to us on the \"Witch of Endor.\"\r\n\r\nNext in rank and far more illustrious was his chief suffragan, the\r\nmetropolitan of Palestine, the bishop of Cæsarea, Eusebius. We honor him\r\nas the father of ecclesiastical history, as the chief depositary of the\r\ntraditions which connect the fourth with the first century. But in the\r\nbishops of Nicæa his presence awakened feelings of a very different\r\nkind. He alone of the eastern prelates could tell what was in the mind\r\nof the Emperor; he was the clerk of the imperial closet; he was the\r\ninterpreter, the chaplain, the confessor of Constantine. And yet he was\r\non the wrong side. Two especially, we may be sure, of the Egyptian\r\nChurch, were on the watch for any slip that he might make.\r\nAthanasius--whatever may have been the opinions of later times\r\nrespecting the doctrines of Eusebius--was convinced that he was at heart\r\nan Arian. Potammon of the one eye had known him formerly in the days of\r\npersecution, and was ready with that most fatal taunt, which, on a later\r\noccasion, he threw out against him, that, while he had thus suffered for\r\nthe cause of Christ, Eusebius had escaped by sacrificing to an idol.\r\n\r\nIf Eusebius was suspected of Arianism, he was supported by most of his\r\nsuffragan bishops in Palestine, of whom Paulinus of Tyre, and\r\nPatrophilus of Bethshan (Scythopolis) were the most remarkable. One,\r\nhowever, a champion of orthodoxy, was distinguished, not in himself, but\r\nfor the see which he occupied--once the highest in Christendom, in a few\r\nyears about to claim something of its former grandeur, but at the time\r\nof the council known only as a second-rate Syro-Roman city--Macarius,\r\nbishop of Ælia Capitolina, that is, \"Jerusalem.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Neocæsarea, a border fortress on the Euphrates, came its confessor\r\nbishop, Paul, who, like Paphnutius and Potammon, had suffered in the\r\npersecutions, but more recently under Licinius. His hands were paralyzed\r\nby the scorching of the muscles of all the fingers with red-hot iron.\r\nAlong with him were the orthodox representatives of four famous\r\nchurches, who, according to the Armenian tradition, travelled in\r\ncompany. Their leader was the marvel, \"the Moses\" as he was termed, of\r\nMesopotamia, James, or Jacob, bishop of Nisibis. He had lived for years\r\nas a hermit on the mountains--in the forests during the summer, in\r\ncaverns during the winter--browsing on roots and leaves like a wild\r\nbeast, and like a wild beast clothed in a rough goat-hair cloak. This\r\ndress and manner of life, even after he became bishop, he never laid\r\naside; and the mysterious awe which his presence inspired was increased\r\nby the stories of miraculous powers which, we are told, he exercised in\r\na manner as humane and playful as it was grotesque; as when he turned\r\nthe washerwoman's hair white, detected the impostor who pretended to be\r\ndead, and raised an army of gnats against the Persians. His fame as a\r\ntheologian rests on disputed writings.\r\n\r\nThe second was Ait-allaha--\"the brought of God,\" like the Greek\r\n\"Theophorus\"--who had just occupied the see of Edessa, and finished the\r\nbuilding of the cemetery of his cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe third was Aristaces, said to be the cousin of Jacob of Bisibis and\r\nson of Gregory the Illuminator, founder of the Armenian Church. He\r\nrepresented both his father and the bishop and Tiridates, the king of\r\nArmenia; the bishop and King having received a special invitation from\r\nConstantine, and sent their written professions of faith by the hands of\r\nAristaces.\r\n\r\nThe fourth came from beyond the frontier, the sole representative\r\nof the more distant East, \"John the Persian,\" who added to his\r\nname the more sounding title--here appearing for the first time,\r\nbut revived in our own days as the designation of our own bishops\r\nof Calcutta--\"Metropolitan of India.\"\r\n\r\nA curious tradition related that this band, including eleven other names\r\nfrom the remote East, were the only members of the Nicene Council who\r\nhad not sustained some bodily mutilation or injury.\r\n\r\nAs this little band advanced westward, they encountered a remarkable\r\npersonage, who stands at the head of the next group which we meet--the\r\nprelates of Asia Minor and Greece. This was Leontius of Cæsarea in\r\nCappadocia. From his hands, it was said, Gregory of Armenia had\r\nreceived ordination, and from his successors in the see of Cæsarea had\r\ndesired that every succeeding bishop of Armenia should receive\r\nordination likewise. For this reason, it may be, Aristaces and his\r\ncompany sought them out. They found Leontius already on his journey, and\r\nthey overtook him at a critical moment. He was on the point of baptizing\r\nanother Gregory, father of a much more celebrated Gregory, the future\r\nbishop of Nazianzen. A light, it was believed, shone from the water,\r\nwhich was only discerned by the sacred travellers.\r\n\r\nLeontius was claimed by the Arians, but still more decidedly by the\r\northodox. Others, of the same side, are usually named as from the same\r\nregion, among them Hypatius of Gangra, whose end we shall witness at the\r\nclose of these events, and Hermogenes the deacon, afterward bishop of\r\nCæsarea, who acted as secretary of the council.\r\n\r\nEusebius of Nicomedia, afterward of Constantinople, Theognis of Nicæa,\r\nMaris of Chalcedon, and Menophantus of Ephesus, were among the most\r\nresolute defenders of Arius. It is curious to reflect that they\r\nrepresent the four sees of the four orthodox councils of the Church. The\r\nthree last named soon vanish away from history. But Eusebius of\r\nNicomedia, friend, namesake, perhaps even brother of the bishop of\r\nCæsarea, was a personage of high importance both then and afterward. As\r\nAthanasius was called \"the Great\" by the orthodox, so was Eusebius by\r\nthe Arians. Even miracles were ascribed to him. Originally bishop of\r\nBeyruth (Berytus), he had been translated to the see of Nicomedia, then\r\nthe capital of the Eastern Empire. He had been a favorite of the\r\nEmperor's rival Licinius, and had thus become intimate with Constantia,\r\nthe Emperor's sister, the wife, now the widow of Licinius. Through her\r\nand through his own distant relationship with the imperial family he\r\nkept a hold on the court which he never lost, even to the moment when he\r\nstood by the dying bed of the Emperor, years afterward, and received him\r\ninto the Church. We must not be too hard on the Christianity of\r\nEusebius, if we wish to vindicate the baptism of Constantine.\r\n\r\nNot far from the great prelate of the capital of the East would be the\r\nrepresentative of what was now a small Greek town, but in five years\r\nfrom that time would supersede altogether the glories of Nicomedia.\r\nMetrophanes, bishop of Byzantium, was detained by old age and sickness,\r\nbut Alexander, his presbyter, himself seventy years of age, was there\r\nwith a little secretary of the name of Paul, not more than twelve years\r\nold, one of the readers and collectors of the Byzantine Church.\r\nAlexander had already corresponded with his namesake on the Arian\r\ncontroversy, and was apparently attached firmly to the orthodox side.\r\n\r\nBesides their more regular champions the orthodox party of Greece and\r\nAsia Minor had a few very eccentric allies. One was Acesius, the\r\nNovatian, \"the Puritan,\" summoned by Constantine from Byzantium with\r\nAlexander, from the deep respect entertained by the Emperor for his\r\nascetic character. He was attended by a boy, Auxanon, who lived to a\r\ngreat age afterward as a presbyter in the same sect. This child was then\r\nliving with a hermit, Eutychianus, on the heights of the neighboring\r\nmountain of the Bithynian Olympus, and he descended from these solitudes\r\nto attend upon Acesius. From him we have obtained some of the most\r\ncurious details of the council.\r\n\r\nMarcellus, Bishop of Ancyra, was among the bishops, the fiercest\r\nopponent of Arius, and, when the active deacon of Alexandria was not\r\npresent, seems to have borne the brunt of the arguments. Yet, if we may\r\njudge from his subsequent history, Athanasius could never have been\r\nquite at ease in leaving the cause in his hands. He was one of those\r\nawkward theologians who never could attack Arianism without falling into\r\nSabellianism; and in later life he was twice deposed from his see for\r\nheresy, once excommunicated by Athanasius himself; and in the present\r\nform of the Nicene Creed one clause--that which asserts that \"the\r\nkingdom of Christ shall have no end\"--is said to have been expressly\r\naimed at his exaggerated language.\r\n\r\nAnd now come two, who in the common pictures of the council always\r\nappear together, of whom the one probably left the deepest impression on\r\nhis contemporaries; and the other, if he were present at all, on the\r\nsubsequent traditions of the council. From the island of Cyprus there\r\narrived the simple shepherd Spyridion, a shepherd both before and after\r\nhis elevation to the episcopate. Strange stories were told by his\r\nfellow-islanders to the historian Socrates of the thieves who were\r\nmiraculously caught in attempting to steal his sheep, and of Spyridion's\r\ngood-humored reply when he found them in the morning, and gave them a\r\nram, that they might not have sat up all night for nothing.\r\n\r\nAnother tale, exactly similar to the fantastic Mussulman legends which\r\nhand about stories of Jerusalem, told how he had gained an answer from\r\nhis dead daughter Irene to tell where a certain deposit was hidden. Two\r\nless marvellous, but more instructive, stories bring out the simplicity\r\nof his character. He rebuked a celebrated preacher at Cyprus for\r\naltering, in a quotation from the gospels, the homely word for \"bed\"\r\ninto \"couch.\" \"What! are you better than He who said 'bed,' that you are\r\nashamed to use his words?\" On occasion of a way-worn traveller coming to\r\nhim in Lent, finding no other food in the house, he presented him with\r\nsalted pork; and when the stranger declined, saying that he could not as\r\na Christian break his fast: \"So much the less reason,\" he said, \"have\r\nyou for scruple; to the pure all things are pure.\"\r\n\r\nA characteristic legend attaches to the account of his journey to the\r\ncouncil. It was his usual practice to travel on foot. But on this\r\noccasion the length of the journey, as well as the dignity of his\r\noffice, induced him to ride, in company with his deacon, on two mules, a\r\nwhite and a chestnut. One night at his arrival at a caravansary where a\r\ncavalcade of orthodox bishops were already assembled, the mules were\r\nturned out to pasture, while he retired to his devotions. The bishops\r\nhad conceived an alarm lest the cause of orthodoxy should suffer in the\r\ncouncil by the ignorance or awkwardness of the Shepherd of Cyprus when\r\nopposed to the subtleties of the Alexandrian heretic. Accordingly,\r\ntaking advantage of his encounter, they determined to throw a decisive\r\nimpediment in his way. They cut off the heads of his two mules, and\r\nthen, as is the custom in oriental travelling, started on their journey\r\nbefore sunrise. Spyridion also rose, but was met by his terrified deacon\r\nannouncing the unexpected disaster. On arriving at the spot the saint\r\nbade the deacon attach the heads to the dead bodies. He did so, and at a\r\nsign from the bishop the two mules with their restored heads shook\r\nthemselves as if from a deep sleep, and started to their feet. Spyridion\r\nand the deacon mounted and soon overtook the travellers. As the day\r\nbroke the prelates and the deacon were alike astonished at seeing that\r\nhe, performing the annexation in the dark and in haste, had fixed the\r\nheads on the wrong shoulders, so that the white mule had now a chestnut\r\nhead, and the chestnut mule had the head of its white companion. Thus\r\nthe miracle was doubly attested, the bishops doubly discomfited, and the\r\nsimplicity of Spyridion doubly exemplified.\r\n\r\nMany more stories might be told of him, but, to use the words of an\r\nancient writer who has related some of them, \"from the claws you can\r\nmake out the lion.\" Of all the Nicene fathers, it may yet be said that\r\nin a certain curious sense he is the only one who has survived the decay\r\nof time. After resting for many years in his native Cyprus his body was\r\ntransferred to Constantinople, where it remained till a short time\r\nbefore the fall of the empire. It was thence conveyed to Corfu, where it\r\nis still preserved. Hence by a strange resuscitation of fame he has\r\nbecome the patron saint, one might almost say the divinity, of the\r\nIonian Islands. Twice a year in solemn procession he is carried round\r\nthe streets of Corfu. Hundreds of Corfutes bear his name, now abridged\r\ninto the familiar diminutive of \"Spiro.\" The superstitious veneration\r\nentertained for the old saint is a constant source of quarrel between\r\nthe English residents and the native Ionians. But the historian may be\r\npardoned for gazing with a momentary interest on the dead hands, now\r\nblack and withered, that subscribed the Creed of Nicæa.\r\n\r\nStill more famous--and still more apocryphal, at least in his attendance\r\nat Nicæa--is Nicolas, bishop of Myra. Not mentioned by a single ancient\r\nhistorian, he yet figures in the traditional pictures of the council as\r\nthe foremost figure of all. Type as he is of universal benevolence to\r\nsailors, to thieves, to the victims of thieves, to children--known by\r\nhis broad red face and flowing white hair--the traditions of the East\r\nalways represent him as standing in the midst of the assembly, and\r\nsuddenly roused by righteous indignation to assail the heretic Arius\r\nwith a tremendous box on the ear.\r\n\r\nOne more group of deputies closes the arrivals. The Nicene Council was a\r\ncouncil of the Eastern Church, and Eastern seemingly were at least three\r\nhundred and ten of the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But the West\r\nwas not entirely unrepresented. Nicasius from France, Marcus from\r\nCalabria, Capito from Sicily, Eustorgius from Milan--where a venerable\r\nchurch is still dedicated to his memory--Domnus of Stridon in Pannonia\r\nwere the less conspicuous deputies of the western provinces.\r\n\r\nBut there were five men whose presence must have been full of interest\r\nto their Eastern brethren. Corresponding to John the Persian from the\r\nExtreme East was Theophilus the Goth from the extreme North. His light\r\ncomplexion doubtless made a marked contrast with the tawny hue and dark\r\nhair of almost all the rest. They rejoiced to think that they had a\r\ngenuine Scythian among them. From all future generations of his Teutonic\r\ncountrymen he may claim attention as the predecessor and teacher of\r\nUlphilas, the great missionary of the Gothic nation.\r\n\r\nOut of the province of Northern Africa, the earliest cradle of the Latin\r\nChurch, came Cæcilian, bishop of Carthage. A few years ago he had\r\nhimself been convened before the two Western councils of the Lateran and\r\nof Arles, and had there been acquitted of the charges brought against\r\nhim by the Donatists.\r\n\r\nIf any of the distant orientals had hoped to catch a sight of the bishop\r\nof the \"Imperial City,\" they were doomed to disappointment. Doubtless\r\nhad he been there his position as prelate of the capital would have\r\nbeen, if not first, at least among the first. But Sylvester was now far\r\nadvanced in years; and in his place came the two presbyters, who,\r\naccording to the arrangement laid down by the Emperor, would have\r\naccompanied him had he been able to make the journey. In this simple\r\ndeputation later writers have seen--and perhaps by a gradual process the\r\nconnection might be traced--the first germ of _legati a latere_. But it\r\nmust have been a very far-seeing eye which in Victor and Vincentius, the\r\ntwo unknown elders, representing their sick old bishop, could have\r\ndetected the predecessors of Pandulf or of Wolsey. With them, however,\r\nwas a man who, though now long forgotten, was then an object of deeper\r\ninterest to Christendom than any bishop of Rome could at that time have\r\nbeen. It was the world-renowned Spaniard, as he is called by Eusebius;\r\nthe magician from Spain, as he is called by Zosimus; Hosius, bishop of\r\nCordova. He was the representative of the westernmost of European\r\nchurches; but, as Eusebius of Cæsarea was the chief counsellor of the\r\nEmperor in the Greek Church, so was Hosius in the Latin, as shown in the\r\ndarkest and most mysterious crisis of Constantine's life.\r\n\r\nIt was probably by degrees that these different arrivals took place, and\r\nthe lapse of two or three weeks must be supposed for the preparatory\r\narrangements before the council was formally opened. This interval was\r\noccupied by eager discussions on the questions likely to be debated. The\r\nfirst assemblage had been, as we have seen, within the walls of a public\r\nbuilding. But the other preliminary meetings were held, as was natural,\r\nin the streets or colonnades in the open air. The novelty of the\r\noccasion had collected many strangers to the spot. Laymen, philosophers,\r\nheathen as well as Christians, might be seen joining in the arguments on\r\neither side, orthodox as well as heretical. There were also discussions\r\namong the orthodox themselves as to the principle on which the debates\r\nshould be conducted. The enumeration of the characters just given shows\r\nthat there were two very different elements in the assembly, such indeed\r\nas will always constitute the main difficulty in making any general\r\nstatements of theology which shall be satisfactory at once to the few\r\nand to the many. A large number, perhaps the majority, consisted of\r\nrough, simple, almost illiterate men, like Spyridion the shepherd,\r\nPotammon the hermit, Acesius the puritan, who held their faith earnestly\r\nand sincerely, but without conscious knowledge of the grounds on which\r\nthey maintained it, incapable of arguing themselves, or of entering into\r\nthe arguments of their opponents. These men, when suddenly brought into\r\ncollision with the acutest and most learned disputants of the age,\r\nnaturally took up the position that the safest course was to hold by\r\nwhat had been handed down, without any further inquiry or explanation.\r\n\r\nA story somewhat variously told is related of an encounter of one of\r\nthese simple characters with the more philosophical combatants, which,\r\nin whatever way it be taken, well illustrates the mixed character of the\r\ncouncil, and the choice of the courses open before it. As Socrates\r\ndescribes the incident, the disputes were running so high, from the mere\r\npleasure of argument, that there seemed likely to be no end to the\r\ncontroversy, when suddenly a simple-minded layman, who by his sightless\r\neye or limping leg bore witness of his zeal for the Christian faith,\r\nstepped among them and abruptly said, \"Christ and the apostles left us\r\nnot a system of logic nor a vain deceit, but a naked truth to be guided\r\nby faith and good works.\" \"There has,\" says Bishop Kaye in recording the\r\nstory, \"been hardly any age of the Church in which its members have not\r\nrequired to be reminded of this lesson.\" On the present occasion the\r\nbystanders, at least for the moment, were struck by its happy\r\napplication. The disputants, after hearing this plain word of truth,\r\ntook their differences more good-humoredly and the hubbub of controversy\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\nThe tradition grew in later times into the form which it bears in all\r\nthe pictures of the council, and which is commemorated in the services\r\nof the Greek Church. Aware of his incapacity of argument he took a brick\r\nand said: \"You deny that three can be one. Look at this: it is one, and\r\nyet it is composed of the three elements of fire, earth, and water.\" As\r\nhe spoke the brick resolved itself into its component parts; the fire\r\nflew upward, the clay remained in his hand, and the water fell to the\r\nground. The philosopher, or, according to some accounts, Arius himself\r\nwas so confounded as to declare himself converted on the spot.\r\n\r\nThese tales represent probably the feeling of a large portion of the\r\ncouncil--the sound, unprofessional, untheological, lay element which lay\r\nat the basis of all their weakness and their strength. The historian\r\nSocrates is very anxious to prove that the assembly was not entirely\r\ncomposed of men of this kind, and he points triumphantly to the presence\r\nof such men as Eusebius of Cæsarea. No proof was necessary. The\r\nsubsequent history of the council itself is a sufficient indication\r\nthat, however small a minority might be the dialecticians and\r\ntheologians, yet they constitute the life and movement of the whole.\r\nSocrates dwells with evident pleasure on the circumstance that the\r\nultimate decisions were only made after long inquiry, and that\r\neverything was stirred to the bottom.\r\n\r\nWe may wish with Bishop Jeremy Taylor and Bishop Kaye that it had been\r\notherwise. But there is a point of view in which we may fully sympathize\r\nwith the course that was taken. All the elements which go to make up the\r\ninterest of theology were involved: love of free inquiry, desire of\r\nprecision in philosophical statements, research into Christian\r\nantiquity, comparison of the texts of Scripture one with another.\r\nTraditional and episcopal authority was regarded as insufficient for the\r\nestablishment of the faith. The well-known clause of the Twenty-first\r\nArticle does but express the principle of the Nicene Fathers themselves:\r\n\"Things ordained by them as necessary for salvation have neither\r\nstrength nor authority unless it may be declared that they are taken out\r\nof Holy Scripture.\" The battle was fought and won by quotations, not\r\nfrom tradition, but from the Old and New Testaments. The overruling\r\nsentiment was that even ancient opinions were not to be received without\r\nsifting and inquiry. The chief combatant and champion of the faith was\r\nnot the bishop of Antioch or of Rome, nor the pope of Alexandria, but\r\nthe deacon Athanasius. The eager discussions of Nicæa present the first\r\ngrand precedent for the duty of private judgment, and the free,\r\nunrestrained exercise of biblical and historical criticism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] Some of the old writers declared that Arius died by the falling out\r\nof his bowels, as if by a miracle. The matter became a subject of much\r\ncontroversy. Mosheim thinks it most probable that Arius was poisoned by\r\nhis enemies. Most recorders of the present day are content to say simply\r\nthat \"he died suddenly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nA.D. 330\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON\r\n\r\n     On the eastern part of the site of Constantinople stood the ancient\r\n     Greek city of Byzantium, said to have been founded in the seventh\r\n     century B.C. From its situation on the Bosporus it enjoyed great\r\n     advantages as a trading centre, and was especially noted for its\r\n     control of the corn supply. There also were fisheries from which\r\n     vast wealth was derived. After the battle of Platæa (B.C. 479),\r\n     which put an end to the Persian invasion of Greece, Byzantium was\r\n     recolonized. In the later Grecian wars it was many times taken,\r\n     being besieged in the year B.C. 339 by Philip of Macedon and\r\n     relieved by Phocion. Soon after this it formed an alliance with\r\n     Alexander the Great; but the city was thenceforth continually\r\n     harassed by enemies, and never regained its former prosperity.\r\n     About the year B.C. 277 it was menaced by the Gauls, to whom the\r\n     Byzantines were forced to pay tribute. When those invaders had been\r\n     driven back by the Thracian tribes, these in turn exacted from\r\n     Byzantium like payments, and to increase its revenues the city\r\n     taxed all vessels entering the Euxine. This led, B.C. 220, to a war\r\n     with Rhodes, instigated by aggrieved merchants in different parts\r\n     of the world, the result of which was that the Byzantines levied no\r\n     more tribute on ships.\r\n\r\n     By treaty, B.C. 148, Byzantium entered into relations with Rome,\r\n     then engaged in eastern wars, and from that time the Byzantines\r\n     sought Roman favor, and long maintained an alliance with the\r\n     empire. After this, little is told of Byzantium until the war of\r\n     the emperor Septimius Severus with his great rival, Niger, governor\r\n     of Syria. Byzantium adhered to the cause of Niger. Confident in\r\n     their future if he should be victorious, the Byzantines indulged\r\n     dreams of becoming the head of an eastern empire. Their city was\r\n     strongly fortified, they had a powerful fleet, and for three years\r\n     they held out against the Roman besiegers, then, after untold\r\n     sufferings and slaughter, yielded under the distress of famine. \"At\r\n     last they were reduced to chewing leather hides soaked in water,\r\n     and finally to the horrible extremity in which the weak become\r\n     literally the prey of the strong.\" The Romans destroyed the\r\n     magnificent city walls and deprived Byzantium of municipal and\r\n     political liberties.\r\n\r\n     The fall of Byzantium was accomplished in A.D. 194-196, and when\r\n     next its site became the scene of historic events a wholly new\r\n     order of things had been inaugurated in the world. After his\r\n     successful war with his colleague Licinius, sole ruler of the\r\n     East, Constantine had him put to death in A.D. 325. Constantine\r\n     then became sole augustus, and in 330 he transferred the capital of\r\n     the empire from Rome to Byzantium, which was henceforth called\r\n     Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness,\r\nand the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine. After a\r\ntranquil and prosperous reign, the conqueror bequeathed to his family\r\nthe inheritance of the Roman Empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a\r\nnew religion; and the innovations which he established have been\r\nembraced and consecrated by succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat and abdication of Licinius, his victorious rival\r\nproceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future\r\ntimes, the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire and religion\r\nof Constantine. The motives, whether of pride or of policy, which first\r\ninduced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of\r\ngovernment, had acquired additional weight by the example of his\r\nsuccessors and the habits of forty years. Rome was insensibly confounded\r\nwith the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy;\r\nand the country of the Cæsars was viewed with cold indifference by a\r\nmartial prince, born in the neighborhood of the Danube, educated in the\r\ncourts and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions\r\nof Britain. The Italians, who had received Constantine as their\r\ndeliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes\r\ncondescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but they were\r\nseldom honored with the presence of their new sovereign.\r\n\r\nDuring the vigor of his age, Constantine, according to the various\r\nexigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity, or with active\r\ndiligence, along the frontiers of his extensive dominions, and was\r\nalways prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic\r\nenemy. But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the\r\ndecline of life, he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more\r\npermanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the\r\nchoice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the confines of Europe\r\nand Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between\r\nthe Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct\r\nof the Persian monarch, who indignantly supported the yoke of an\r\nignominious treaty. With these views, Diocletian had selected and\r\nembellished the residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was\r\njustly abhorred by the protector of the Church; and Constantine was not\r\ninsensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the\r\nglory of his own name. During the late operations of the war against\r\nLicinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a\r\nsoldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position of Byzantium, and\r\nto observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against a hostile\r\nattack, while it was accessible on every side to the benefits of\r\ncommercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nMany ages before Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of\r\nantiquity had described the advantages of a situation, from whence a\r\nfeeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea and the honors of\r\na flourishing and independent republic.[50]\r\n\r\nThe harbor of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm of the\r\nBosporus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the\r\n\"Golden Horn.\" The curve which it describes might be compared to the\r\nhorn of a stag, or as it should seem, with more propriety, to that of an\r\nox. The epithet of _golden_ was expressive of the riches which every\r\nwind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and\r\ncapacious port of Constantinople. The river Lycus, formed by the conflux\r\nof two little streams, pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh\r\nwater, which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical\r\nshoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess. As the\r\nvicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas, the constant\r\ndepth of the harbor allows goods to be landed on the quays without the\r\nassistance of boats; and it has been observed that in many places the\r\nlargest vessels may rest their prows against the houses, while their\r\nsterns are floating in the water. From the mouth of the Lycus to that\r\nof the harbor, this arm of the Bosporus is more than seven miles in\r\nlength. The entrance is about five hundred yards broad, and a strong\r\nchain could be occasionally thrown across it, to guard the port and city\r\nfrom the attack of a hostile navy.\r\n\r\nThe geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have surveyed the\r\nform and extent of the Hellespont, assign about sixty miles for the\r\nwinding course, and about three miles for the ordinary breadth, of those\r\ncelebrated straits. But the narrowest part of the channel is found to\r\nthe northward of the old Turkish castles between the cities of Sestus\r\nand Abydus. It was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage\r\nof the flood for the possession of his mistress.[51] It was here\r\nlikewise, in a place where the distance between the opposite banks\r\ncannot exceed five hundred paces, that Xerxes imposed a stupendous\r\nbridge of boats, for the purpose of transporting into Europe a hundred\r\nand seventy myriads of barbarians. A sea contracted within such narrow\r\nlimits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of _broad_,\r\nwhich Homer, as well as Orpheus, has frequently bestowed on the\r\nHellespont. But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature: the\r\ntraveller, and especially the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who\r\npursued the windings of the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery,\r\nwhich appeared on every side to terminate the prospect, insensibly lost\r\nthe remembrance of the sea: and his fancy painted those celebrated\r\nstraits, with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift\r\ncurrent, in the midst of a woody and inland country, and at length,\r\nthrough a wide mouth, discharging itself into the Ægean or Archipelago.\r\n\r\nAncient Troy, seated on an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked\r\nthe mouth of the Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of\r\nwaters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets, the Simois and\r\nScamander. The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore\r\nfrom the Sigæan to the Rhætean promontory; and the flanks of the army\r\nwere guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of\r\nAgamemnon.\r\n\r\nThe first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his\r\ninvincible myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the\r\nother. After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and\r\nto the ingratitude of the Greeks, his sepulchre was erected on the\r\nground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of\r\nHector; and the citizens of the rising town of Rhæteum celebrated his\r\nmemory with divine honors. Before Constantine gave a just preference to\r\nthe situation of Byzantium, he had conceived the design of erecting the\r\nseat of empire on this celebrated spot, from whence the Romans derived\r\ntheir fabulous origin. The extensive plain which lies below ancient\r\nTroy, toward the Rhætean promontory and the tomb of Ajax, was first\r\nchosen for his new capital; and though the undertaking was soon\r\nrelinquished, the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers\r\nattracted the notice of all who sailed through the straits of the\r\nHellespont.\r\n\r\nWe are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of\r\nConstantinople; which appears to have been formed by nature for the\r\ncentre and capital of a great monarchy. Situated in the forty-first\r\ndegree of latitude, the imperial city commanded, from her seven hills,\r\nthe opposite shores of Europe and Asia; the climate was healthy and\r\ntemperate, the soil fertile, the harbor secure and capacious; and the\r\napproach on the side of the Continent was of small extent and easy\r\ndefence. The Bosporus and the Hellespont may be considered as the two\r\ngates of Constantinople; and the prince who possessed these important\r\npassages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to\r\nthe fleets of commerce. The preservation of the eastern provinces may,\r\nin some degree, be ascribed to the policy of Constantine, as the\r\nbarbarians of the Euxine, who in the preceding age had poured their\r\narmaments into the heart of the Mediterranean, soon desisted from the\r\nexercise of piracy and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier.\r\n\r\nWhen the gates of the Hellespont and Bosporus were shut, the capital\r\nstill enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which\r\ncould supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous\r\ninhabitants. The sea-coasts of Thrace and Bithynia, which languish under\r\nthe weight of Turkish oppression, still exhibit a rich prospect of\r\nvineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful harvests; and the Propontis has\r\never been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite\r\nfish, that are taken in their stated seasons, without skill and almost\r\nwithout labor. But when the passages of the straits were thrown open for\r\ntrade, they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of\r\nthe north and south, of the Euxine, and of the Mediterranean. Whatever\r\nrude commodities were collected in the forests of Germany and Scythia,\r\nas far as the sources of the Tanais and the Borysthenes; whatsoever was\r\nmanufactured by the skill of Europe or Asia; the corn of Egypt, and the\r\ngems and spices of the farthest India, were brought by the varying winds\r\ninto the port of Constantinople, which for many ages attracted the\r\ncommerce of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in a single\r\nspot, was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine. But as some\r\ndecent mixture of prodigy and fable has, in every age, been supposed to\r\nreflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities, the Emperor\r\nwas desirous of ascribing his resolution, not so much to the uncertain\r\ncounsels of human policy as to the infallible and eternal decrees of\r\ndivine wisdom. In one of his laws he has been careful to instruct\r\nposterity that, in obedience to the commands of God, he laid the\r\neverlasting foundations of Constantinople: and though he has not\r\ncondescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was\r\ncommunicated to his mind, the defect of his modest silence has been\r\nliberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers, who describe\r\nthe nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of Constantine, as he\r\nslept within the walls of Byzantium. The tutelar genius of the city, a\r\nvenerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, was\r\nsuddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own hands adorned\r\nwith all the symbols of imperial greatness. The monarch awoke,\r\ninterpreted the auspicious omen, and obeyed, without hesitation, the\r\nwill of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the\r\nRomans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous\r\nsuperstition; and though Constantine might omit some rites which savored\r\ntoo strongly of their pagan origin, yet he was anxious to leave a deep\r\nimpression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators. On foot,\r\nwith a lance in his hand, the Emperor himself led the solemn procession,\r\nand directed the line which was traced as the boundary of the destined\r\ncapital: till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment\r\nby the assistants, who, at length, ventured to observe that he had\r\nalready exceeded the most ample measure of a great city. \"I shall still\r\nadvance,\" replied Constantine, \"till He, the invisible guide who marches\r\nbefore me, thinks proper to stop.\" Without presuming to investigate the\r\nnature or motives of this extraordinary conductor, we shall content\r\nourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits\r\nof Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIn the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the seraglio\r\noccupy the eastern promontory, the first of the seven hills, and cover\r\nabout one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure. The seat of\r\nTurkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a\r\nGrecian republic; but it may be supposed that the Byzantines were\r\ntempted by the conveniency of the harbor to extend their habitations on\r\nthat side beyond the modern limits of the seraglio. The new walls of\r\nConstantine stretched from the port to the Propontis across the enlarged\r\nbreadth of the triangle, at a distance of fifteen stadia from the\r\nancient fortification; and with the city of Byzantium they enclosed five\r\nof the seven hills, which, to the eyes of those who approach\r\nConstantinople, appear to rise above each other in beautiful order.\r\nAbout a century after the death of the founder the new buildings,\r\nextending on one side up the harbor, and on the other along the\r\nPropontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth and the broad\r\nsummit of the seventh hill.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of\r\nthe barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital\r\nwith an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls. From the eastern\r\npromontory to the Golden Gate, the extreme length of Constantinople was\r\nabout three Roman miles; the circumference measured between ten and\r\neleven; and the surface might be computed as equal to about two thousand\r\nacres. It is impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations\r\nof modern travellers, who have sometimes stretched the limits of\r\nConstantinople over the adjacent villages of the European and even of\r\nthe Asiatic coast.[52] But the suburbs of Pera and Galata, though\r\nsituate beyond the harbor, may deserve to be considered as a part of the\r\ncity; and this addition may perhaps authorize the measure of a Byzantine\r\nhistorian, who assigns sixteen Greek, about fourteen Roman, miles for\r\nthe circumference of his native city. Such an extent may seem not\r\nunworthy of an imperial residence. Yet Constantinople must yield to\r\nBabylon and Thebes, to ancient Rome, to London, and even to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe master of the Roman world, who aspired to erect an eternal monument\r\nof the glories of his reign, could employ in the prosecution of that\r\ngreat work the wealth, the labor, and all that yet remained of the\r\ngenius of obedient millions. Some estimate may be formed of the expense\r\nbestowed with imperial liberality on the foundation of Constantinople,\r\nby the allowance of about two million five hundred thousand pounds for\r\nthe construction of the walls, the porticos, and the aqueducts. The\r\nforests that overshadowed the shores of the Euxine, and the celebrated\r\nquarries of white marble in the little island of Proconnesus, supplied\r\nan inexhaustible stock of materials, ready to be conveyed, by the\r\nconvenience of a short water-carriage, to the harbor of Byzantium. A\r\nmultitude of laborers and artificers urged the conclusion of the work\r\nwith incessant toil; but the impatience of Constantine soon discovered\r\nthat, in the decline of the arts, the skill as well as numbers of his\r\narchitects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his\r\ndesigns. The magistrates of the most distant provinces were therefore\r\ndirected to institute schools, to appoint professors, and by the hopes\r\nof rewards and privileges to engage in the study and practice of\r\narchitecture a sufficient number of ingenious youths who had received a\r\nliberal education. The buildings of the new city were executed by such\r\nartificers as the reign of Constantine could afford; but they were\r\ndecorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of\r\nPericles and Alexander. To revive the genius of Phidias and Lysippus\r\nsurpassed indeed the power of a Roman emperor; but the immortal\r\nproductions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed without\r\ndefence to the rapacious vanity of a despot.\r\n\r\nBy his commands the cities of Greece and Asia were despoiled of their\r\nmost valuable ornaments. The trophies of memorable wars, the objects of\r\nreligious veneration, the most finished statues of the gods and heroes,\r\nof the sages and poets, of ancient times, contributed to the splendid\r\ntriumph of Constantinople, and gave occasion to the remark of the\r\nhistorian Cedrenus, who observes, with some enthusiasm, that nothing\r\nseemed wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom those\r\nadmirable monuments were intended to represent. But it is not in the\r\ncity of Constantine, nor in the declining period of an empire, when the\r\nhuman mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery, that we should\r\nseek for the souls of Homer and of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Byzantium the conqueror had pitched his tent on the\r\ncommanding eminence of the second hill. To perpetuate the memory of his\r\nsuccess, he chose the same advantageous position for the principal\r\nforum, which appears to have been of a circular or rather elliptical\r\nform. The two opposite entrances formed triumphal arches; the porticos,\r\nwhich enclosed it on every side, were filled with statues; and the\r\ncentre of the forum was occupied by a lofty column, of which a mutilated\r\nfragment is now degraded by the appellation of the \"burnt pillar.\" This\r\ncolumn was erected on a pedestal of white marble twenty feet high, and\r\nwas composed of ten pieces of porphyry, each of which measured about ten\r\nfeet in height and about thirty-three in circumference. On the summit of\r\nthe pillar, above one hundred and twenty feet from the ground, stood the\r\ncolossal statue of Apollo. It was of bronze, had been transported either\r\nfrom Athens or from a town of Phrygia, and was supposed to be the work\r\nof Phidias. The artist had represented the god of day, or, as it was\r\nafterward interpreted, the emperor Constantine himself, with a sceptre\r\nin his right hand, the globe of the world in his left, and a crown of\r\nrays glittering on his head.[53]\r\n\r\nThe Circus, or Hippodrome, was a stately building about four hundred\r\npaces in length and one hundred in breadth. The space between the two\r\n_metæ_ or goals was filled with statues and obelisks; and we may still\r\nremark a very singular fragment of antiquity, the bodies of three\r\nserpents, twisted into one pillar of brass. Their triple heads had once\r\nsupported the golden tripod which, after the defeat of Xerxes, was\r\nconsecrated in the temple of Delphi by the victorious Greeks. The beauty\r\nof the hippodrome has been long since defaced by the rude hands of the\r\nTurkish conquerors; but, under the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it\r\nstill serves as a place of exercise for their horses. From the throne,\r\nwhence the emperor viewed the Circensian games, a winding staircase\r\ndescended to the palace; a magnificent edifice, which scarcely yielded\r\nto the residence of Rome itself, and which, together with the dependent\r\ncourts, gardens, and porticos, covered a considerable extent of ground\r\nupon the banks of the Propontis between the Hippodrome and the Church of\r\nSt. Sophia. We might likewise celebrate the baths, which still retained\r\nthe name of Zeuxippus,[54] after they had been enriched, by the\r\nmunificence of Constantine, with lofty columns, various marbles, and\r\nabove threescore statues of bronze. But we should deviate from the\r\ndesign of this history if we attempted minutely to describe the\r\ndifferent buildings or quarters of the city. It may be sufficient to\r\nobserve that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great capital, or\r\ncontribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants, was\r\ncontained within the walls of Constantinople. A particular description,\r\ncomposed about a century after its foundation, enumerates a capitol or\r\nschool of learning, a circus, two theatres, eight public and one hundred\r\nand fifty-three private baths, fifty-two porticos, five granaries, eight\r\naqueducts or reservoirs of water, four spacious halls for the meetings\r\nof the senate or courts of justice, fourteen churches, fourteen palaces,\r\nand four thousand three hundred and eighty-eight houses, which, for\r\ntheir size or beauty, deserved to be distinguished from the multitude of\r\nplebeian habitations.\r\n\r\nThe populousness of his favored city was the next and most serious\r\nobject of the attention of its founder. In the dark ages which succeeded\r\nthe translation of the empire, the remote and the immediate consequences\r\nof that memorable event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the\r\nGreeks and the credulity of the Latins. It was asserted, and believed,\r\nthat all the noble families of Rome, the senate, and the equestrian\r\norder, with their innumerable attendants, had followed their Emperor to\r\nthe banks of the Propontis; that a spurious race of strangers and\r\nplebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient capital; and\r\nthat the lands of Italy, long since converted into gardens, were at once\r\ndeprived of cultivation and inhabitants. Since the growth of\r\nConstantinople cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and\r\nof industry, it must be admitted that this artificial colony was raised\r\nat the expense of the ancient cities of the empire.\r\n\r\nMany opulent senators of Rome, and of the eastern provinces, were\r\nprobably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the fortunate\r\nspot which he had chosen for his own residence. The invitations of a\r\nmaster are scarcely to be distinguished from commands; and the\r\nliberality of the Emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedience. He\r\nbestowed on his favorites the palaces which he had built in the several\r\nquarters of the city, assigned them lands and pensions for the support\r\nof their dignity, and alienated the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant\r\nhereditary estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the\r\ncapital. But these encouragements and obligations soon became\r\nsuperfluous and were gradually abolished. Wherever the seat of\r\ngovernment is fixed, a considerable part of the public revenue will be\r\nexpended by the prince himself, by his ministers, by the officers of\r\njustice, and by the domestics of the palace. The most wealthy of the\r\nprovincials will be attracted by the powerful motives of interest and\r\nduty, of amusement and curiosity. A third and more numerous class of\r\ninhabitants will insensibly be formed, of servants, of artificers, and\r\nof merchants, who derive their subsistence from their own labor and from\r\nthe wants or luxury of the superior ranks. In less than a century\r\nConstantinople disputed with Rome itself the preëminence of riches and\r\nnumbers. New piles of buildings, crowded together with too little regard\r\nto health or convenience, scarcely allowed the intervals of narrow\r\nstreets for the perpetual throng of men, of horses, and of carriages.\r\nThe allotted space of ground was insufficient to contain the increasing\r\npeople; and the additional foundations, which, on either side, were\r\nadvanced into the sea, might alone have composed a very considerable\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe frequent and regular distributions of wine and oil, of corn or\r\nbread, of money or provisions, had almost exempted the poorer citizens\r\nof Rome from the necessity of labor. The magnificence of the first\r\nCæsars was in some measure imitated by the founder of Constantinople;\r\nbut his liberality, however it might excite the applause of the people,\r\nhas incurred the censure of posterity. A nation of legislators and\r\nconquerors might assert their claim to the harvests of Africa, which had\r\nbeen purchased with their blood; and it was artfully contrived by\r\nAugustus that, in the enjoyment of plenty, the Romans should lose the\r\nmemory of freedom. But the prodigality of Constantine could not be\r\nexcused by any consideration either of public or private interest; and\r\nthe annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt for the benefit of his new\r\ncapital was applied to feed a lazy and insolent populace at the expense\r\nof the husbandmen of an industrious province. Some other regulations of\r\nthis Emperor are less liable to blame, but they are less deserving of\r\nnotice. He divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or quarters,\r\ndignified the public council with the appellation of senate,\r\ncommunicated to the citizens the privileges of Italy, and bestowed on\r\nthe rising city the title of colony, the first and most favored daughter\r\nof ancient Rome. The venerable parent still maintained the legal and\r\nacknowledged supremacy which was due to her age, to her dignity, and to\r\nthe remembrance of her former greatness.\r\n\r\nAs Constantine urged the progress of the work with the impatience of a\r\nlover, the walls, the porticos, and the principal edifices were\r\ncompleted in a few years, or, according to another account, in a few\r\nmonths; but this extraordinary diligence should excite the less\r\nadmiration, since many of the buildings were finished in so hasty and\r\nimperfect a manner that, under the succeeding reign, they were preserved\r\nwith difficulty from impending ruin. But while they displayed the vigor\r\nand freshness of youth, the founder prepared to celebrate the dedication\r\nof his city. The games and largesses which crowned the pomp of this\r\nmemorable festival may easily be supposed; but there is one circumstance\r\nof a more singular and permanent nature, which ought not entirely to be\r\noverlooked. As often as the birthday of the city returned, the statue of\r\nConstantine, framed by his order, of gilt wood, and bearing in its right\r\nhand a small image of the genius of the place, was erected on a\r\ntriumphal car. The guards, carrying white tapers, and clothed in their\r\nrichest apparel, accompanied the solemn procession as it moved through\r\nthe Hippodrome. When it was opposite to the throne of the reigning\r\nEmperor, he rose from his seat, and with grateful reverence adored the\r\nmemory of his predecessor. At the festival of the dedication, an edict,\r\nengraved on a column of marble, bestowed the title of \"Second or New\r\nRome\" on the city of Constantine. But the name of Constantinople has\r\nprevailed over that honorable epithet; and after the revolution of\r\nfourteen centuries, still perpetuates the fame of its author.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] The navigator Byzas, who was styled the Son of Neptune, founded the\r\ncity 656 years before the Christian era. His followers were drawn from\r\nArgos and Megara. Byzantium was afterward rebuilt and fortified by the\r\nSpartan general Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[51] The practical illustration of the possibility of Leander's feat by\r\nLord Byron is too well known to need particular reference.\r\n\r\n[52] The accurate Thevenot walked in one hour and three-quarters round\r\ntwo of the sides of the triangle, from the Kiosk of the Seraglio to the\r\nseven towers. D'Anville examines with care, and receives with\r\nconfidence, this decisive testimony, which gives a circumference of ten\r\nor twelve miles. The extravagant computation of Tournefort of\r\nthirty-four or thirty miles, without including Scutari, is a strange\r\ndeparture from his usual character.\r\n\r\n[53] On this column Constantine, with singular shamelessness, placed his\r\nown statue with the attributes of Apollo and Christ. He substituted the\r\nnails of the Passion for the rays of the sun. Constantine was replaced\r\nby the \"great and religious\" Julian; Julian, by Theodosius. A.D. 1412\r\nthe keystone was loosened by an earthquake. The statue fell in the reign\r\nof Alexius Comnenus, and was replaced by the cross. The palladium was\r\nsaid to be buried under the pillar.\r\n\r\n[54] Zeuxippus was an epithet of Jupiter, and the baths were a part of\r\nold Byzantium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULIAN THE APOSTATE BECOMES EMPEROR OF ROME\r\n\r\nA.D. 360\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON\r\n\r\n     The great reign of Constantine was ended. The new capital,\r\n     Constantinople, which after fifteen centuries still perpetuates the\r\n     name of its imperial founder, had outrivalled Rome. The heirs of\r\n     Constantine, the sons of Fausta, had all been called Cæsar, and\r\n     were appointed to succeed to imperial power. Constantine,\r\n     Constantius, and Constans they were named. They held court in\r\n     different parts of the realm during their father's life, although\r\n     he reserved for himself the title of Augustus.\r\n\r\n     The last years of his reign of thirty years had been peaceful,\r\n     disturbed only by the insurrection in Cyprus and the wars of the\r\n     Goths and Sarmatians. And so he died, and the purple and diadem\r\n     were but empty symbols, as he lay in state upon his golden bed.\r\n\r\n     The great Emperor was no sooner dead than the sons made haste to\r\n     rid themselves of all possible rivals in a family that seemed too\r\n     numerous for peace. Two uncles and seven cousins were quickly put\r\n     out of the way under one pretence and another.\r\n\r\n     The provinces were divided between the three brothers, and they\r\n     reigned peacefully for three years, until Constantine demanded the\r\n     surrender to him of a part of the dominions of Constans. In the war\r\n     which ensued Constantine was killed, and Constans took possession\r\n     of his brother's provinces, refusing any share of them to\r\n     Constantius.\r\n\r\n     He reigned ten years longer, when he was destroyed, A.D. 350, by a\r\n     conspiracy in Gaul headed by one Magnentius. This soldier, of\r\n     barbarian extraction, was soon defeated by Constantius, who now\r\n     became sole Emperor.\r\n\r\n     He soon found his burden of power too great, and decided to share\r\n     it with the two young nephews who had been permitted to live when\r\n     the massacre of the house of Constantine occurred.\r\n\r\n     To Gallus, the elder, he gave the title of cæsar, and invested him\r\n     with the government of the East. Gallus conducted himself like a\r\n     Nero and was disgraced and executed about three years later.\r\n\r\n     The younger nephew, Julian, had been brought up in the Christian\r\n     faith, and received an excellent education, which was finished in\r\n     the philosophical schools of Athens. He was created cæsar by\r\n     Constantius, whose sister Helena he married, and was invested with\r\n     the government of Gaul, Spain, and Britain.\r\n\r\n     Julian's wise civil administration was very acceptable to the\r\n     people, and his brilliant military exploits established his fame\r\n     throughout the empire and won the affection of his soldiers. He\r\n     repulsed the Alemanns and the Franks, sending captives to the court\r\n     of Constantius. His expeditions beyond the Rhine were crowned with\r\n     success. He restored the cities of Gaul and stemmed the tide of\r\n     barbarian invasion.\r\n\r\n     All these triumphs had awakened the jealousy of the emperor\r\n     Constantius, who was practically ruled by the eunuchs and bishops\r\n     at his court. The rising fortunes of Julian had caused envy among\r\n     many, who set about to poison the mind of Constantius with\r\n     innuendoes and false suggestions. They resolved to disarm Julian\r\n     and to separate him from his army. The Emperor ordered Julian to\r\n     send his best troops to the war in Persia. But they forgot that the\r\n     troops adored Julian. They overlooked the fact that the soldiers\r\n     would see through such a scheme to humiliate their commander. The\r\n     Gauls also feared the departure of Julian's men, for they dreaded\r\n     the attacks of the Germans. This then was the situation. Julian\r\n     attempted to follow the orders of the Emperor. But fate ordained\r\n     otherwise. The army proclaimed him emperor. He refused the honor at\r\n     first, but was forced to assume the dangerous title. The war which\r\n     immediately followed was cut short by the sudden death of\r\n     Constantius, and Julian became sole ruler of the Roman Empire. He\r\n     renounced Christianity and is known in history as Julian the\r\n     Apostate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and\r\nbishops, the praises of Julian were repeated with transport in every\r\npart of the empire, except in the palace of Constantius. The barbarians\r\nof Germany had felt and still dreaded the arms of the young cæsar; his\r\nsoldiers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials\r\nenjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favorites, who had opposed\r\nhis elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly considered\r\nthe friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long as the fame\r\nof Julian was doubtful the buffoons of the palace, who were skilled in\r\nthe language of satire, tried the efficacy of those arts which they had\r\nso often practised with success. They easily discovered that his\r\nsimplicity was not exempt from affectation; the ridiculous epithets of a\r\nhairy savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the\r\ndress and person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest despatches\r\nwere stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious\r\nGreek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the art of war amid the\r\ngroves of the academy.\r\n\r\nThe voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of\r\nvictory; the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be\r\npainted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himself was meanly\r\nambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honorable reward of his\r\nlabors. In the letters crowned with laurel, which, according to ancient\r\ncustom, were addressed to the provinces, the name of Julian was omitted.\r\n\"Constantius had made his dispositions in person; _he_ had signalized\r\nhis valor in the foremost ranks; _his_ military conduct had secured the\r\nvictory; and the captive king of the barbarians was presented to _him_\r\non the field of battle,\" from which he was at that time distant about\r\nforty days' journey. So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of\r\ndeceiving the public credulity, or even of satisfying the pride of the\r\nEmperor himself. Secretly conscious that the applause and favor of the\r\nRomans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind\r\nwas prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants,\r\nwho colored their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of\r\ntruth and candor. Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian, they\r\nacknowledged, and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior talents,\r\nand important services. But they darkly insinuated that the virtues of\r\nthe cæsar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes if\r\nthe inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty;\r\nor if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his\r\nallegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness. The\r\npersonal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as a\r\nlaudable anxiety for the public safety; while in private, and perhaps in\r\nhis own breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear,\r\nthe sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly conceived for\r\nthe inimitable virtues of Julian.\r\n\r\nThe apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of the\r\neastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design which was\r\nartfully concerted by the imperial ministers. They resolved to disarm\r\nthe cæsar; to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and\r\ndignity; and to employ, in a distant war against the Persian monarch,\r\nthe hardy veterans who had vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the\r\nfiercest nations of Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of\r\nhis winter quarters at Paris in the administration of power, which, in\r\nhis hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty\r\narrival of a tribune and a notary, with positive orders from the\r\nEmperor, which _they_ were directed to execute and _he_ was commanded\r\nnot to oppose.\r\n\r\nConstantius signified his pleasure that four entire legions, the Celtæ,\r\nand Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, should be separated from\r\nthe standard of Julian, under which they had acquired their fame and\r\ndiscipline; that in each of the remaining bands three hundred of the\r\nbravest youths should be selected; and that this numerous detachment,\r\nthe strength of the Gallic army, should instantly begin their march, and\r\nexert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the opening of the\r\ncampaign, on the frontiers of Persia. The cæsar foresaw and lamented the\r\nconsequences of this fatal mandate. Most of the auxiliaries, who engaged\r\ntheir voluntary service, had stipulated that they should never be\r\nobliged to pass the Alps. The public faith of Rome, and the personal\r\nhonor of Julian, had been pledged for the observance of this condition.\r\nSuch an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence and\r\nexcite the resentment of the independent warriors of Germany, who\r\nconsidered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as the\r\nmost valuable of their possessions.\r\n\r\nThe legionaries who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans were\r\nenlisted for the general defence of the republic; but those mercenary\r\ntroops heard with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic\r\nand of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate\r\nand manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they despised, and\r\nperhaps hated, the Emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the\r\nPersian arrows, and the burning deserts of Asia. They claimed as their\r\nown the country which they had saved, and excused their want of spirit,\r\nby pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting their\r\nfamilies and friends. The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from\r\nthe knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the\r\nprovinces were exhausted of their military strength the Germans would\r\nviolate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears; and\r\nnotwithstanding the abilities and valor of Julian, the general of a\r\nnominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed, must find\r\nhimself, after a vain resistance, either a prisoner in the camp of the\r\nbarbarians or a criminal in the palace of Constantius.\r\n\r\nIf Julian complied with the orders which he had received, he subscribed\r\nhis own destruction and that of a people who deserved his affection. But\r\na positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a declaration of war. The\r\ninexorable jealousy of the Emperor, the peremptory and perhaps insidious\r\nnature of his commands, left not any room for a fair apology or candid\r\ninterpretation; and the dependent station of the cæsar scarcely allowed\r\nhim to pause or to deliberate. Solitude increased the perplexity of\r\nJulian; he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust,\r\nwho had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the\r\neunuchs; he could not even enforce his representations by the\r\nconcurrence of the ministers, who would have been afraid or ashamed to\r\napprove the ruin of Gaul. The moment had been chosen when Lupicinus, the\r\ngeneral of the cavalry, was despatched into Britain to repulse the\r\ninroads of the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienne by\r\nthe assessment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt\r\nstatesman, declining to assume a responsible part on this dangerous\r\noccasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of Julian, who\r\nrepresented to him that in every important measure the presence of the\r\nprefect was indispensable in the council of the prince.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the cæsar was oppressed by the rude and importunate\r\nsolicitations of the imperial messengers, who presumed to suggest that\r\nif he expected the return of his ministers, he would charge himself with\r\nthe guilt of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution.\r\nUnable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the most\r\nserious terms, his wish, and even his intention, of resigning the\r\npurple, which he could not preserve with honor, but which he could not\r\nabdicate with safety.\r\n\r\nAfter a painful conflict, Julian was compelled to acknowledge that\r\nobedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and that the\r\nsovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He issued\r\nthe necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of\r\nConstantius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and\r\nthe detachments from the several garrisons moved toward their respective\r\nplaces of assembly. They advanced with difficulty through the trembling\r\nand affrighted crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite their pity\r\nby silent despair or loud lamentations; while the wives of the soldiers,\r\nholding their infants in their arms, accused the desertion of their\r\nhusbands, in the mixed language of grief, of tenderness, and of\r\nindignation. This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of\r\nthe cæsar; he granted a sufficient number of post-wagons to transport\r\nthe wives and families of the soldiers, endeavored to alleviate the\r\nhardships which he was constrained to inflict, and increased, by the\r\nmost laudable arts, his own popularity and the discontent of the exiled\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage; their\r\nlicentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent to tent\r\nwith more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for the most daring\r\nacts of sedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes, a seasonable\r\nlibel was secretly dispersed, which painted in lively colors the\r\ndisgrace of the cæsar, the oppression of the Gallic army, and the feeble\r\nvices of the tyrant of Asia. The servants of Constantius were astonished\r\nand alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit. They pressed the\r\ncæsar to hasten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently\r\nrejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian, who proposed that\r\nthey should not march through Paris, and suggested the danger and\r\ntemptation of a last interview.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the approach of the troops was announced the cæsar went out\r\nto meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been erected in a\r\nplain before the gates of the city. After distinguishing the officers\r\nand soldiers who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention,\r\nJulian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding\r\nmultitude: he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause;\r\nencouraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honor of serving under the\r\neyes of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admonished them that the\r\ncommands of Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, who were apprehensive of offending their general by an\r\nindecent clamor, or of belying their sentiments by false and venal\r\nacclamations, maintained an obstinate silence, and after a short pause\r\nwere dismissed to their quarters. The principal officers were\r\nentertained by the cæsar, who professed, in the warmest language of\r\nfriendship, his desire and his inability to reward, according to their\r\ndeserts, the brave companions of his victories. They retired from the\r\nfeast, full of grief and perplexity, and lamented the hardship of their\r\nfate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native\r\ncountry. The only expedient which could prevent their separation was\r\nboldly agitated and approved; the popular resentment was insensibly\r\nmoulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of complaint were\r\nheightened by passion, and their passions were inflamed by wine, as, on\r\nthe eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in licentious\r\nfestivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous multitude, with swords\r\nand bows and torches in their hands, rushed into the suburbs,\r\nencompassed the palace, and, careless of future dangers, pronounced the\r\nfatal and irrevocable words \"JULIAN AUGUSTUS!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince, whose anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly\r\nacclamations, secured the doors against their intrusion, and, as long as\r\nit was in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents\r\nof a nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day the soldiers, whose zeal was\r\nirritated by opposition, forcibly entered the palace, seized, with\r\nrespectful violence, the object of their choice, guarded Julian with\r\ndrawn swords through the streets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal,\r\nand with repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor. Prudence, as well\r\nas loyalty, inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable\r\ndesigns, and of preparing, for his oppressed virtue, the excuse of\r\nviolence. Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to\r\nindividuals, he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed\r\nhis indignation; conjured them not to sully the fame of their immortal\r\nvictories; and ventured to promise, that if they would immediately\r\nreturn to their allegiance, he would undertake to obtain from the\r\nEmperor not only a free and gracious pardon, but even the revocation of\r\nthe orders which had excited their resentment.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers, who were conscious of their guilt, chose rather to\r\ndepend on the gratitude of Julian than on the clemency of the Emperor.\r\nTheir zeal was insensibly turned into impatience, and their impatience\r\ninto rage. The inflexible cæsar sustained, till the third hour of the\r\nday, their prayers, their reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he\r\nyield till he had been repeatedly assured that if he wished to live he\r\nmust consent to reign. He was exalted on a shield in the presence and\r\namid the unanimous acclamations of the troops; a rich military collar,\r\nwhich was offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem; the ceremony\r\nwas concluded by the promise of a moderate donative; and the new\r\nEmperor, overwhelmed with real or affected grief, retired into the most\r\nsecret recesses of his apartment.\r\n\r\nThe grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence, but his\r\ninnocence must appear extremely doubtful in the eyes of those who have\r\nlearned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes. His\r\nlively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of\r\nhope and fear, of gratitude and revenge, of duty and of ambition, of the\r\nlove of fame, and of the fear of reproach. But it is impossible for us\r\nto calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments; or\r\nto ascertain the principles of action which might escape the\r\nobservation, while they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies;\r\ntheir tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion; and if\r\nJulian had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of\r\nchance, he must have employed the most consummate artifice without\r\nnecessity, and probably without success. He solemnly declares, in the\r\npresence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the\r\nother deities, that till the close of the evening which preceded his\r\nelevation he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; and it\r\nmay seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of a\r\nphilosopher. Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the\r\nenemy, and that he himself was the favorite, of the gods, might prompt\r\nhim to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the auspicious moment of\r\nhis reign, which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of\r\nmankind. When Julian had received the intelligence of the conspiracy he\r\nresigned himself to a short slumber, and afterward related to his\r\nfriends that he had seen the Genius of the Empire waiting with some\r\nimpatience at his door, pressing for admittance, and reproaching his\r\nwant of spirit and ambition. Astonished and perplexed, he addressed his\r\nprayers to the great Jupiter, who immediately signified, by a clear and\r\nmanifest omen, that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason excites our\r\nsuspicion and eludes our inquiry. Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at\r\nonce so credulous and so crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble\r\nmind, it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\nTo moderate the zeal of his party, to protect the persons of his\r\nenemies, to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were\r\nformed against his life and dignity, were the cares which employed the\r\nfirst days of the reign of the new emperor. Although he was firmly\r\nresolved to maintain the station which he had assumed, he was still\r\ndesirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war, of\r\ndeclining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius, and of\r\npreserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and\r\ningratitude. Adorned with the ensigns of military and imperial pomp,\r\nJulian showed himself in the field of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed\r\nwith ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil, their leader, and\r\ntheir friend. He recapitulated their victories, lamented their\r\nsufferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and\r\nchecked their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly till he had\r\nobtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of the\r\nEast would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views\r\nof conquest and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the\r\nGallic provinces.\r\n\r\nOn this foundation he composed, in his own name, and in that of the\r\narmy, a specious and moderate epistle, which was delivered to Pentadius,\r\nhis master of the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius, two\r\nambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer and observe the\r\ndispositions of Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with the modest\r\nappellation of cæsar; but Julian solicits, in a peremptory, though\r\nrespectful, manner, the confirmation of the title of augustus. He\r\nacknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while he justifies,\r\nin some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops which had\r\nextorted his reluctant consent. He allows the supremacy of his brother\r\nConstantius, and engages to send him an annual present of Spanish\r\nhorses, to recruit his army with a select number of barbarian youths,\r\nand to accept from his choice a prætorian prefect of approved discretion\r\nand fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other\r\ncivil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the\r\nsovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes the Emperor\r\nto consult the dictates of justice; to distrust the arts of those venal\r\nflatterers, who subsist only by the discord of princes, and to embrace\r\nthe offer of a fair and honorable treaty, equally advantageous to the\r\nrepublic and to the house of Constantine.\r\n\r\nIn this negotiation Julian claimed no more than he already possessed.\r\nThe delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces\r\nof Gaul, Spain, and Britain was still obeyed under a name more\r\nindependent and august. The soldiers and the people rejoiced in a\r\nrevolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty.\r\nFlorentius was a fugitive; Lupicinus a prisoner. The persons who were\r\ndisaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured; and the\r\nvacant offices were distributed, according to the recommendation of\r\nmerit, by a prince who despised the intrigues of the palace and the\r\nclamors of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the most\r\nvigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held in readiness\r\nfor immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the disorders of\r\nthe times. The cruel persecution of the faction of Magnentius had filled\r\nGaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers. They cheerfully\r\naccepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could\r\ntrust, submitted to the restraints of military discipline, and retained\r\nonly their implacable hatred to the person and government of\r\nConstantius.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he\r\nappeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the Rhine in\r\nthe neighborhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the\r\nAttuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that they might ravage, with\r\nimpunity, the frontiers of a divided empire. The difficulty, as well as\r\nglory, of this enterprise consisted in a laborious march; and Julian had\r\nconquered, as soon as he could penetrate into a country which former\r\nprinces had considered as inaccessible. After he had given peace to the\r\nbarbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the\r\nRhine from Cleves to Basel; surveyed, with peculiar attention, the\r\nterritories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni,\r\npassed through Besançon, which had severely suffered from their fury,\r\nand fixed his head-quarters at Vienne for the ensuing winter.\r\n\r\nThe barrier of Gaul was improved and strengthened with additional\r\nfortifications; and Julian entertained some hopes that the Germans, whom\r\nhe had so often vanquished, might, in his absence, be restrained by the\r\nterror of his name. Vadomair was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he\r\nesteemed or feared; and while the subtle barbarian affected to observe\r\nthe faith of treaties, the progress of his arms threatened the State\r\nwith an unseasonable and dangerous war. The policy of Julian\r\ncondescended to surprise the prince of the Alemanni by his own arts: and\r\nVadomair, who, in the character of a friend, had incautiously accepted\r\nan invitation from the Roman governors, was seized in the midst of the\r\nentertainment, and sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain. Before\r\nthe barbarians were recovered from their amazement the Emperor appeared\r\nin arms on the banks of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river,\r\nrenewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been\r\nalready made by four preceding expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors of Julian had been instructed to execute, with the\r\nutmost diligence, their important commission. But, in their passage\r\nthrough Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the tedious and\r\naffected delays of the provincial governors; they were conducted by slow\r\njourneys from Constantinople to Cæsarea in Cappadocia; and when at\r\nlength they were admitted to the presence of Constantius, they found\r\nthat he had already conceived, from the despatches of his own officers,\r\nthe most unfavorable opinion of the conduct of Julian and of the Gallic\r\narmy. The letters were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers\r\nwere dismissed with indignation and contempt; and the looks, the\r\ngestures, the furious language of the monarch expressed the disorder of\r\nhis soul. The domestic connection, which might have reconciled the\r\nbrother and the husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by the death\r\nof that princess, whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless, and\r\nwas at last fatal to herself. The empress Eusebia had preserved, to the\r\nlast moment of her life, the warm, and even jealous, affection which she\r\nhad conceived for Julian; and her mild influence might have moderated\r\nthe resentment of a prince, who, since her death, was abandoned to his\r\nown passions, and to the arts of his eunuchs.\r\n\r\nBut the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the\r\npunishment of a private enemy; he continued his march toward the\r\nconfines of Persia, and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions\r\nwhich might entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of\r\ntheir offended sovereign. He required that the presumptuous cæsar should\r\nexpressly renounce the appellation and rank of augustus, which he had\r\naccepted from the rebels; that he should descend to his former station\r\nof a limited and dependent minister; that he should vest the powers of\r\nthe State and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by\r\nthe imperial court; and that he should trust his safety to the\r\nassurances of pardon, which were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic\r\nbishop, and one of the Arian favorites of Constantius. Several months\r\nwere ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the\r\ndistance of three thousand miles between Paris and Antioch; and, as soon\r\nas Julian perceived that his modest and respectful behavior served only\r\nto irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly resolved to\r\ncommit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war.\r\n\r\nHe gave a public and military audience to the quæstor Leonas; the\r\nhaughty epistle of Constantius was read to the attentive multitude; and\r\nJulian protested, with the most flattering deference, that he was ready\r\nto resign the title of augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those\r\nwhom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The faint proposal\r\nwas impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of \"Julian Augustus,\r\ncontinue to reign, by the authority of the army, of the people, of the\r\nrepublic which you have saved,\" thundered at once from every part of the\r\nfield, and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius. A part of the\r\nletter was afterward read, in which the Emperor arraigned the\r\ningratitude of Julian, whom he had invested with the honors of the\r\npurple; whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness; whom he\r\nhad preserved in his infancy, when he was left a helpless orphan.\r\n\r\n\"An orphan!\" interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by indulging\r\nhis passions: \"does the assassin of my family reproach me that I was\r\nleft an orphan? He urges me to revenge those injuries which I have long\r\nstudied to forget.\" The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas, who, with\r\nsome difficulty, had been protected from the popular fury, was sent back\r\nto his master with an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of\r\nthe most vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and\r\nof resentment, which had been suppressed and imbittered by the\r\ndissimulation of twenty years. After this message, which might be\r\nconsidered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some weeks\r\nbefore, had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany, made a\r\npublic declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the\r\nIMMORTAL GODS, and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the\r\nfriendship of Constantius.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate resolution. He\r\nhad discovered, from intercepted letters, that his adversary,\r\nsacrificing the interest of the State to that of the monarch, had again\r\nexcited the barbarians to invade the provinces of the West. The position\r\nof two magazines, one of them collected on the banks of the Lake of\r\nConstance, the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to\r\nindicate the march of two armies; and the size of those magazines, each\r\nof which consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather\r\nflour, was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the\r\nenemy who prepared to surround him. But the imperial legions were still\r\nin their distant quarters of Asia; the Danube was feebly guarded; and if\r\nJulian could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the important provinces of\r\nIllyricum, he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his\r\nstandard, and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute\r\nto the expenses of the civil war.\r\n\r\nHe proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers;\r\ninspired them with a just confidence in their general and in themselves;\r\nand exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the\r\nenemy, moderate to their fellow-citizens, and obedient to their\r\nofficers. His spirited discourse was received with the loudest\r\nacclamations, and the same troops which had taken up arms against\r\nConstantius, when he summoned them to leave Gaul, now declared with\r\nalacrity that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of\r\nEurope or Asia. The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers,\r\nclashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their\r\nthroats, devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the service of\r\na leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror\r\nof the Germans. This solemn engagement, which seemed to be dictated by\r\naffection rather than by duty, was singly opposed by Nebridius, who had\r\nbeen admitted to the office of prætorian prefect.\r\n\r\nThat faithful minister, alone and unassisted, asserted the rights of\r\nConstantius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury\r\nhe had almost fallen an honorable but useless sacrifice. After losing\r\none of his hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the\r\nprince whom he had offended. Julian covered the prefect with his\r\nimperial mantle, and, protecting him from the zeal of his followers,\r\ndismissed him to his own house, with less respect than was perhaps due\r\nto the virtue of an enemy. The high office of Nebridius was bestowed on\r\nSallust; and the provinces of Gaul, which were now delivered from the\r\nintolerable oppression of taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable\r\nadministration of the friend of Julian, who was permitted to practise\r\nthose virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his troops than\r\non the celerity of his motions. In the execution of a daring enterprise,\r\nhe availed himself of every precaution, as far as prudence could\r\nsuggest; and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps, he\r\ntrusted the event to valor and to fortune. In the neighborhood of Basel\r\nhe assembled and divided his army. One body, which consisted of ten\r\nthousand men, was directed under the command of Nevitta, general of the\r\ncavalry, to advance through the midland parts of Rhætia and Noricum. A\r\nsimilar division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus,\r\nprepared to follow the oblique course of the highways, through the Alps\r\nand the northern confines of Italy. The instructions to the generals\r\nwere conceived with energy and precision: to hasten their march in close\r\nand compact columns, which, according to the disposition of the ground,\r\nmight readily be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves\r\nagainst the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards;\r\nto prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude examination\r\nby their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of their strength and\r\nthe terror of his name; and to join their sovereign under the walls of\r\nSirmium.\r\n\r\nFor himself Julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part.\r\nHe selected three thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like\r\ntheir leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat: at the head\r\nof this faithful band he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the\r\nMarcian, or Black Forest, which conceals the sources of the Danube; and,\r\nfor many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to the world. The secrecy\r\nof his march, his diligence and vigor, surmounted every obstacle; he\r\nforced his way over mountains and morasses, occupied the bridges or swam\r\nthe rivers, pursued his direct course, without reflecting whether he\r\ntraversed the territory of the Romans or of the barbarians, and at\r\nlength emerged, between Ratisbon and Vienna, at the place where he\r\ndesigned to embark his troops on the Danube. By a well-concerted\r\nstratagem, he seized a fleet of light brigantines as it lay at anchor;\r\nsecured a supply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the\r\nindelicate but voracious appetite of a Gallic army; and boldly committed\r\nhimself to the stream of the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe labors of his mariners, who plied their oars with incessant\r\ndiligence, and the steady continuance of a favorable wind, carried his\r\nfleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days; and he had already\r\ndisembarked his troops at Bononia, only nineteen miles from Sirmium,\r\nbefore his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had\r\nleft the banks of the Rhine. In the course of this long and rapid\r\nnavigation, the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his\r\nenterprise; and though he accepted the deputations of some cities, which\r\nhastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he passed before the\r\nhostile stations, which were placed along the river, without indulging\r\nthe temptation of signalizing a useless and ill-timed valor. The banks\r\nof the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators, who gazed on\r\nthe military pomp, anticipated the importance of the event, and diffused\r\nthrough the adjacent country the fame of a young hero, who advanced with\r\nmore than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the\r\nWest. Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of the cavalry, commanded\r\nthe military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the\r\ndoubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor believe.\r\n\r\nHe had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of\r\ncollecting his troops, when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active\r\nofficer, whom Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed\r\nforward with some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his\r\nlife or death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the\r\npresence of Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and dispelled\r\nthe terror and amazement which seemed to stupefy his faculties. But\r\nLucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want\r\nof discretion, by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly\r\nventured, with a handful of men, to expose his person in the midst of\r\nhis enemies. \"Reserve for your master Constantius these timid\r\nremonstrances,\" replied Julian, with a smile of contempt: \"when I gave\r\nyou my purple to kiss, I received you not as a counsellor, but as a\r\nsuppliant.\" Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt, and\r\nthat boldness only could command success, he instantly advanced, at the\r\nhead of three thousand soldiers, to attack the strongest and most\r\npopulous city of the Illyrian provinces.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful\r\nacclamations of the army and people, who, crowned with flowers, and\r\nholding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged\r\nsovereign to his imperial residence. Two days were devoted to the\r\npublic joy, which was celebrated by the games of the Circus; but, early\r\non the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the narrow\r\npass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Hæmus; which, almost in the\r\nmidway between Sirmium and Constantinople, separates the provinces of\r\nThrace and Dacia, by an abrupt descent toward the former, and a gentle\r\ndeclivity on the side of the latter. The defence of this important post\r\nwas intrusted to the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of the\r\nItalian division, successfully executed the plan of the march and\r\njunction which their master had so ably conceived.\r\n\r\nThe homage which Julian obtained, from the fears or the inclination of\r\nthe people, extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms. The\r\nprefectures of Italy and Illyricum were administered by Taurus and\r\nFlorentius, who united that important office with the vain honors of the\r\nconsulship; and, as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to\r\nthe court of Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of\r\nhis temper, stigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of the\r\nYear, the epithet of _fugitive_ to the names of the two consuls.\r\n\r\nThe provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates\r\nacknowledged the authority of an emperor who, conciliating the qualities\r\nof a soldier with those of a philosopher, was equally admired in the\r\ncamps of the Danube and in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or,\r\nmore properly, from his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he\r\ndistributed, to the principal cities of the empire, a labored apology\r\nfor his own conduct; published the secret despatches of Constantius, and\r\nsolicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors, the one of\r\nwhom had expelled, and the other had invited, the barbarians. Julian,\r\nwhose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude, aspired to\r\nmaintain, by argument as well as by arms, the superior merits of his\r\ncause; and to excel, not only in the arts of war, but in those of\r\ncomposition. His epistle to the senate and people of Athens seems to\r\nhave been dictated by an elegant enthusiasm; which prompted him to\r\nsubmit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his\r\nown times, with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading,\r\nin the days of Aristides, before the tribunal of the Areopagus. His\r\napplication to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted to bestow\r\nthe titles of imperial power, was agreeable to the forms of the expiring\r\nrepublic. An assembly was summoned by Tertullus, prefect of the city;\r\nthe epistle of Julian was read; and, as he appeared to be master of\r\nItaly, his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nHis oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine, and his\r\npassionate invective against the vices of Constantius, were heard with\r\nless satisfaction; and the senate, as if Julian had been present,\r\nunanimously exclaimed, \"Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own\r\nfortune\"--an artful expression, which, according to the chance of war,\r\nmight be differently explained; as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of\r\nthe usurper, or as a flattering confession that a single act of such\r\nbenefit to the State ought to atone for all the failings of Constantius.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was speedily\r\ntransmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained\r\nsome respite from the Persian war. Disguising the anguish of his soul\r\nunder the semblance of contempt, Constantius professed his intention of\r\nreturning into Europe, and of giving chase to Julian; for he never spoke\r\nof his military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting\r\nparty. In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this design\r\nto his army; slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the cæsar, and\r\nventured to assure them that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed to meet\r\nthem in the field they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes\r\nand the irresistible weight of their shout of onset.\r\n\r\nThe speech of the Emperor was received with military applause, and\r\nTheodotus, the president of the council of Hierapolis, requested, with\r\ntears of adulation, that _his_ city might be adorned with the head of\r\nthe vanquished rebel. A chosen detachment was despatched away in\r\npost-wagons, to secure, if it were yet possible, the pass of Succi; the\r\nrecruits, the horses, the arms, and the magazines, which had been\r\nprepared against Sapor, were appropriated to the service of the civil\r\nwar; and the domestic victories of Constantius inspired his partisans\r\nwith the most sanguine assurances of success. The notary Gaudentius had\r\noccupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the subsistence of Rome\r\nwas intercepted; and the distress of Julian was increased by an\r\nunexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal\r\nconsequences. Julian had received the submission of two legions and a\r\ncohort of archers, who were stationed at Sirmium; but he suspected with\r\nreason the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the\r\nEmperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed\r\nstate of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from the most important\r\nscene of action.\r\n\r\nThey advanced, with reluctance, as far as the confines of Italy; but as\r\nthey dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the\r\nGermans, they resolved, by the instigation of one of their tribunes, to\r\nhalt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of Constantius on the walls\r\nof that impregnable city. The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the\r\nextent of the mischief, and the necessity of applying an immediate\r\nremedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy;\r\nand the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence and prosecuted with\r\nvigor. But the legionaries, who seemed to have rejected the yoke of\r\ndiscipline, conducted the defence of the place with skill and\r\nperseverance; invited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their\r\ncourage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of Julian, if he should\r\nbe forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the East.\r\n\r\nBut the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative\r\nwhich he pathetically laments, of destroying or of being himself\r\ndestroyed; and the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman\r\nEmpire from the calamities of civil war. The approach of winter could\r\nnot detain the monarch at Antioch; and his favorites durst not oppose\r\nhis impatient desire of revenge. A slight fever, which was perhaps\r\noccasioned by the agitation of his spirits, was increased by the\r\nfatigues of the journey; and Constantius was obliged to halt at the\r\nlittle town of Mopsucrene, twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired,\r\nafter a short illness, in the forty-fifth year of his age and the\r\ntwenty-fourth of his reign. Julian thus became master of the Roman\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUNS AND THEIR WESTERN MIGRATION\r\n\r\nA.D. 374-376\r\n\r\nMARCELLINUS\r\n\r\n     The Huns, whose incursions into Europe constituted the first\r\n     \"yellow peril,\" were a nomadic Mongolian race. In the fourth\r\n     century before Christ they successfully invaded China. From that\r\n     country, about A.D. 90, they were driven by Hiong-nu, and the Huns\r\n     then proceeded, joined by hordes of their fellows from the steppes\r\n     of Tartary, to make their way to the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n     Previous to the incursion of the Huns another Tartar tribe, the\r\n     Alani--the first of that race known to the Romans--had ravaged\r\n     Media and Armenia, A.D. 75, carrying off a vast number of prisoners\r\n     and an enormous booty. They later settled themselves in the country\r\n     between the Volga and the Tanais, at an equal distance from the\r\n     Black Sea and the Caspian. The Huns, having crossed the Volga,\r\n     drove the Alani before them to the Danube. Valens, the then Emperor\r\n     of the East, was a weak, incapable ruler; he failed to recognize\r\n     the peril by which his empire would ere long be threatened, and\r\n     permitted the Alani to find a refuge in his dominions. These were\r\n     in turn followed and absorbed by the Huns, and the whole Roman\r\n     Empire was finally faced by Mongol foes.\r\n\r\n     The historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote racily of these events at\r\n     the time of their occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swift wheel of fortune, which continually alternates adversity with\r\nprosperity, was giving Bellona the Furies for her allies, and arming her\r\nfor war; and now transferred our disasters to the east, as many presages\r\nand portents foreshowed by undoubted signs.\r\n\r\nFor after many true prophecies uttered by diviners and augurs, dogs were\r\nseen to recoil from howling wolves, and the birds of night constantly\r\nuttered querulous and mournful cries; and lurid sunrises made the\r\nmornings dark. Also, at Antioch, among the tumults and squabbles of the\r\npopulace, it had come to be a custom for anyone who fancied himself\r\nill-treated to cry out, in a licentious manner: \"May Valens be burned\r\nalive.\" And the voices of the criers were constantly heard ordering\r\nwood to be carried to warm the baths of Valens, which had been built\r\nunder the superintendence of the Emperor himself.\r\n\r\nAll which circumstances all but pointed out in express words that the\r\nend of the Emperor's life was at hand. Besides all these things, the\r\nghost of the King of Armenia, and the miserable shades of those who had\r\nlately been put to death in the affair of Theodorus, agitated numbers of\r\npeople with terrible alarms, appearing to them in their sleep, and\r\nshrieking out verses of horrible import.\r\n\r\nLast of all, when the ancient walls of Chalcedon were thrown down in\r\norder to build a bath at Constantinople, and the stones were torn\r\nasunder, on one squared stone which was hidden in the very centre of the\r\nwalls these Greek verses were found engraved, which gave a full\r\nrevelation of what was to happen:\r\n\r\n    \"But when young wives and damsels blithe, in dances that delight,\r\n    Shall glide along the city streets, with garlands gayly bright;\r\n    And when these walls, with sad regrets, shall fall to raise a bath,\r\n    Then shall the Huns in multitude break forth with might and wrath,\r\n    By force of arms the barrier-stream of Ister they shall cross,\r\n    O'er Scythic ground and Moesian lands spreading dismay and loss;\r\n    They shall Pannonian horsemen brave, and Gallic soldiers slay,\r\n    And nought but loss of life and breath their course shall ever stay.\"\r\n\r\nThe following circumstances were the original cause of all the\r\ndestruction and various calamities which the fury of Mars roused up,\r\nthrowing everything into confusion by his usual ruinous violence: the\r\npeople called Huns, slightly mentioned in the ancient records, live\r\nbeyond the Sea of Azov, on the border of the Frozen Ocean, and are a\r\nrace savage beyond all parallel.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment of their birth the cheeks of their infant children\r\nare deeply marked by an iron, in order that the usual vigor of their\r\nhair, instead of growing at the proper season, may be withered by the\r\nwrinkled scars; and accordingly they grow up without beards, and\r\nconsequently without any beauty, like eunuchs, though they all have\r\nclosely knit and strong limbs and plump necks; they are of great size,\r\nand bow-legged, so that you might fancy them two-legged beasts, or the\r\nstout figures which are hewn out in a rude manner with an axe on the\r\nposts at the end of bridges.\r\n\r\nThey are certainly in the shape of men, however uncouth, but are so\r\nhardy that they neither require fire nor well-flavored food, but live on\r\nthe roots of such herbs as they get in the fields, or on the half-raw\r\nflesh of any animal, which they merely warm rapidly by placing it\r\nbetween their own thighs and the back of their horses.\r\n\r\nThey never shelter themselves under roofed houses, but avoid them, as\r\npeople ordinarily avoid sepulchres as things not fitted for common use.\r\nNor is there even to be found among them a cabin thatched with reed; but\r\nthey wander about, roaming over the mountains and the woods, and\r\naccustom themselves to bear frost and hunger and thirst from their very\r\ncradles. And even when abroad they never enter a house unless under the\r\ncompulsion of some extreme necessity; nor, indeed, do they think people\r\nunder roofs as safe as others.\r\n\r\nThey wear linen clothes, or else garments made of the skins of\r\nfield-mice; nor do they wear a different dress out of doors from that\r\nwhich they wear at home; but after a tunic is once put round their\r\nnecks, however much it becomes worn, it is never taken off or changed\r\ntill, from long decay, it becomes actually so ragged as to fall to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThey cover their heads with round caps, and their shaggy legs with the\r\nskins of kids; their shoes are not made on any lasts, but are so\r\nunshapely as to hinder them from walking with a free gait. And for this\r\nreason they are not well suited to infantry battles, but are nearly\r\nalways on horseback, their horses being ill-shaped, but hardy; and\r\nsometimes they even sit upon them like women if they want to do anything\r\nmore conveniently. There is not a person in the whole nation who cannot\r\nremain on his horse day and night. On horseback they buy and sell, they\r\ntake their meat and drink, and there they recline on the narrow neck of\r\ntheir steed, and yield to sleep so deep as to indulge in every variety\r\nof dream.\r\n\r\nAnd when any deliberation is to take place on any weighty matter, they\r\nall hold their common council on horseback. They are not under the\r\nauthority of a king, but are contented with the irregular government of\r\ntheir nobles, and under their lead they force their way through all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when provoked, they fight; and when they go into battle, they\r\nform in a solid body, and utter all kinds of terrific yells. They are\r\nvery quick in their operations, of exceeding speed, and fond of\r\nsurprising their enemies. With a view to this, they suddenly disperse,\r\nthen reunite, and again, after having inflicted vast loss upon the\r\nenemy, scatter themselves over the whole plain in irregular formations:\r\nalways avoiding the fort or an intrenchment.\r\n\r\nAnd in one respect you may pronounce them the most formidable of all\r\nwarriors, for when at a distance they use missiles of various kinds,\r\ntipped with sharpened bones instead of the usual points of javelins, and\r\nthese bones are admirably fastened into the shaft of the javelin or\r\narrow; but when they are at close quarters they fight with the sword,\r\nwithout any regard for their own safety; and often while their\r\nantagonists are warding off their blows they entangle them with twisted\r\ncords, so that, their hands being fettered, they lose all power of\r\neither riding or walking.\r\n\r\nNone of them plough, or even touch a plough handle; for they have no\r\nsettled abode, but are homeless and lawless, perpetually wandering with\r\ntheir wagons, which they make their homes; in fact, they seem to be\r\npeople always in flight. Their wives live in these wagons, and there\r\nweave their miserable garments; and here, too, they sleep with their\r\nhusbands, and bring up their children till they reach the age of\r\npuberty; nor, if asked, can any one of them tell you where he was born,\r\nas he was conceived in one place, born in another at a great distance,\r\nand brought up in another still more remote.\r\n\r\nIn truces they are treacherous and inconstant, being liable to change\r\ntheir minds at every breeze of every fresh hope which presents itself,\r\ngiving themselves up wholly to the impulse and inclination of the\r\nmoment; and, like brute beasts, they are utterly ignorant of the\r\ndistinction between right and wrong. They express themselves with great\r\nambiguity and obscurity; have no respect for any religion or\r\nsuperstition whatever; are immoderately covetous of gold; and are so\r\nfickle and irascible that they very often, on the same day that they\r\nquarrel with their companions without any provocation, again become\r\nreconciled to them without any mediator.\r\n\r\nThis active and indomitable race, being excited by an unrestrainable\r\ndesire of plundering the possessions of others, went on ravaging and\r\nslaughtering all the nations in their neighborhood till they reached the\r\nAlani, who were formerly called the Massagetæ; and from what country\r\nthese Alani came, or what territories they inhabit--since my subject has\r\nled me so far--it is expedient now to explain, after showing the\r\nconfusion existing in the accounts of the geographers, who, at last,\r\nhave found out the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Danube, which, is greatly increased by other rivers falling into it,\r\npasses through the territory of the Sauromatæ [Scythians], which extends\r\nas far as the river Don, the boundary between Asia and Europe. On the\r\nother side of this river the Alani inhabit the enormous deserts of\r\nScythia, deriving their own name from the mountains around; and they,\r\nlike the Persians, having gradually subdued all the bordering nations by\r\nrepeated victories, have united them to themselves and comprehended them\r\nunder their own name. Of these other tribes the Neuri inhabit the inland\r\ndistricts, being near the highest mountain chains, which are both\r\nprecipitous and covered with the everlasting frost of the north. Next to\r\nthem are the Budini, and the Geloni, a race of exceeding ferocity, who\r\nflay the enemies they have slain in battle, and make of their skins\r\nclothes for themselves and trappings for their horses. Next to the\r\nGeloni are the Agathyrsi, who dye both their bodies and their hair of a\r\nblue color, the lower classes using spots few in number and small; the\r\nnobles broad spots, close and thick, and of a deeper hue.\r\n\r\nNext to those are the Melanchlænæ and the Anthropophagi, who roam about\r\nupon different tracts of land and live on human flesh. And these men are\r\nso avoided on account of their horrid food that all the tribes which\r\nwere their neighbors have removed to a distance from them. And in this\r\nway the whole of that region to the northeast, till you come to the\r\nChinese, is uninhabited.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the Alani again extend to the east, near the\r\nterritories of the Amazons, and are scattered among many populous and\r\nwealthy nations, stretching to the parts of Asia which, as I am told,\r\nextend up to the Ganges, a river which passes through the country of the\r\nIndians, and falls into the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThen the Alani, being thus divided among the two quarters of the\r\nglobe--the various tribes which make up the whole nation it is not worth\r\nwhile to enumerate--although widely separated, wander, like the nomads,\r\nover enormous districts. But in the progress of time all these tribes\r\ncame to be united under one generic appellation, and are called Alani.\r\n\r\nThey have no cottages, and never use the plough, but live solely on meat\r\nand plenty of milk, mounted on their wagons which they cover with a\r\ncurved awning made of the bark of trees, and then drive them through\r\ntheir boundless deserts. And when they come to any pasture land, they\r\npitch their wagons in a circle, and live like a herd of beasts, eating\r\nup all the forage--carrying, as it were, their cities with them in their\r\nwagons. In them the husbands sleep with their wives--in them their\r\nchildren are born and brought up; these wagons, in short, are their\r\nperpetual habitation, and, wherever they fix them, that place they look\r\nupon as their home.\r\n\r\nThey drive before them their flocks and herds to their pasturage; and\r\nabout all other cattle, they are especially careful of their horses. The\r\nfields in that country are always green, and are interspersed with\r\npatches of fruit-trees, so that, wherever they go, there is no dearth\r\neither of food for themselves or fodder for their cattle. And this is\r\ncaused by the moisture of the soil and the number of the rivers which\r\nflow through these districts.\r\n\r\nAll their old people, and especially all the weaker sex, keep close to\r\nthe wagons and occupy themselves in the lighter employments. But the\r\nyoung men, who from their earliest childhood are trained to the use of\r\nthe horses, think it beneath them to walk. They are also all trained by\r\ncareful discipline of various sorts to become skilful warriors. And this\r\nis the reason why the Persians, who are originally of Scythian\r\nextraction, are very skilful in war.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Alani are men of great stature and beauty. Their hair is\r\nsomewhat yellow, their eyes are terribly fierce; the lightness of their\r\narmor renders them rapid in their movements, and they are in every\r\nrespect equal to the Huns, only more civilized in their food and their\r\nmanner of life. They plunder and hunt as far as the Sea of Azov and the\r\nCimmerian Bosporus, ravaging also Armenia and Media.\r\n\r\nAnd as ease is a delightful thing to men of a quiet and placid\r\ndisposition, so danger and war are a pleasure to the Alani, and among\r\nthem that man is called happy who has lost his life in battle; for those\r\nwho grow old, or who go out of the world from accidental sicknesses,\r\nthey pursue with bitter reproaches as degenerate and cowardly. Nor is\r\nthere anything of which they boast with more pride than of having killed\r\na man; and the most glorious spoils they esteem the scalps which they\r\nhave torn from the heads of those whom they have slain, which they put\r\nas trappings and ornaments on their war horses.\r\n\r\nNor is there any temple or shrine seen in their country, nor even any\r\ncabin thatched with straw, their only idea of religion being to plunge a\r\nnaked sword into the ground with barbaric ceremonies, and they worship\r\nthat with great respect, as Mars, the presiding deity of the regions\r\nover which they wander.\r\n\r\nThey presage the future in a most remarkable manner, for they collect a\r\nnumber of great twigs of osier, then with certain secret incantations\r\nthey separate them from one another on particular days; and from them\r\nthey learn clearly what is about to happen.\r\n\r\nThey have no idea of slavery, inasmuch as they themselves are all born\r\nof noble families; and those whom even now they appoint to be judges are\r\nalways men of proved experience and skill in war. But now let us return\r\nto the subject which we proposed to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe Huns, after having traversed the territories of the Alani, and\r\nespecially of that tribe of them who border on the Gruthungi, and who\r\nare called Tanaitæ, and having slain many of them and acquired much\r\nplunder they made a treaty of friendship and alliance with those who\r\nremained. And when they had united them to themselves, with increased\r\nboldness they made a sudden incursion into the extensive and fertile\r\ndistricts of Ermenrichus, a very warlike prince, and one whom his\r\nnumerous gallant actions of every kind had rendered formidable to all\r\nthe neighboring nations.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished at the violence of this sudden tempest, and although,\r\nlike a prince whose power was well established, he long attempted to\r\nhold his ground, he was at last overpowered by a dread of the evils\r\nimpending over his country, which were exaggerated by common report,\r\ntill he terminated his fear of great danger by a voluntary death.\r\n\r\nAfter his death Vithimiris was made king. He for some time maintained a\r\nresistance to the Alani, relying on the aid of other tribes of the Huns\r\nwhom by large promises of pay he had won over to his party; but, after\r\nhaving suffered many losses, he was defeated by superior numbers and\r\nslain in battle. He left an infant son named Viderichus, of whom\r\nAlatheus and Saphrax undertook the guardianship, both generals of great\r\nexperience and proved courage. And when they, yielding to the\r\ndifficulties of the crisis, had given up all hope of being able to make\r\nan effectual resistance, they retired with caution till they came to the\r\nriver Dniester, which lies between the Danube and the Dnieper, and flows\r\nthrough a vast extent of country.\r\n\r\nWhen Athanaric, the chief magistrate of the Thuringians, had become\r\ninformed of those unexpected occurrences, he prepared to maintain his\r\nground, with a resolution to rise up in strength should he be assailed\r\nas the others had been.\r\n\r\nAt last he pitched his camp at a distance in a very favorable spot near\r\nthe banks of the Dniester and the valleys of the Gruthungi, and sent\r\nMuderic, who afterward became duke of the Arabian frontier, with\r\nLagarimanus and others of the nobles, with orders to advance for twenty\r\nmiles, to reconnoitre the approach of the enemy; while in the mean time\r\nhe himself, without delay, marshalled his troops in line of battle.\r\n\r\nHowever, things turned out in a manner very contrary to his\r\nexpectations. For the Huns--being very sagacious in\r\nconjectures--suspecting that there must be a considerable\r\nmultitude farther off, contrived to pass beyond those they had\r\nseen, and arranged themselves to take their rest where there was\r\nnothing at hand to disturb them; and then, when the moon\r\ndispelled the darkness of night, they forded the river, which was\r\nthe best plan which presented itself, and fearing lest the\r\npickets at the outposts might give the alarm to the distant camp,\r\nthey made all possible speed and advanced with the hope of\r\nsurprising Athanaric himself.\r\n\r\nHe was stupefied at the suddenness of their onset, and, after losing\r\nmany of his men, was compelled to flee for refuge to the precipitous\r\nmountains in the neighborhood, where, being wholly bewildered with the\r\nstrangeness of this occurrence, and the fear of greater evils to come,\r\nhe began to fortify with lofty walls all the territory between the banks\r\nof the River Pruth and the Danube, where it passes through the land of\r\nthe Taifali; and he completed this line of fortification with great\r\ndiligence, thinking that by this step he should secure his own personal\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWhile this important work was going on, the Huns kept pressing on his\r\ntraces with great speed, and they would have overtaken and destroyed him\r\nif they had not been forced to abandon the pursuit from being impeded by\r\nthe great quantity of their booty. In the mean time a report spread\r\nextensively through the other nations of the Goths, that a race of men,\r\nhitherto unknown, had suddenly descended like a whirlwind from the lofty\r\nmountains, as if they had risen from some secret recess of the earth,\r\nand were ravaging and destroying everything which came in their way. And\r\nthen the greater part of the population which, because of their want of\r\nnecessaries, had deserted Athanaric, resolved to flee and to seek a home\r\nremote from all knowledge of the barbarians; and after a long\r\ndeliberation where to fix their abode, they resolved that a retreat into\r\nThrace was the most suitable for these two reasons: first of all,\r\nbecause it is a district most fertile in grass; and also because, by the\r\ngreat breadth of the Danube, it is wholly separated from the barbarians,\r\nwho were already exposed to the thunder-bolts of foreign warfare. And\r\nthe whole population of the tribe adopted this resolution unanimously.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, under the command of their leader Alavivus, they occupied\r\nthe bank of the Danube, and having sent ambassadors to Valens, they\r\nhumbly entreated to be received by him as his subjects, promising to\r\nlive quietly, and to furnish a body of auxiliary troops if any necessity\r\nfor such a force should arise.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were passing in foreign countries, a terrible rumor\r\narose that the tribes of the North were planning new and unprecedented\r\nattacks upon us; and that over the whole region, which extends from the\r\ncountry of the Marcomanni and Quadi to Pontus, a barbarian host,\r\ncomposed of different distant nations, which had suddenly been driven by\r\nforce from their own country, was now, with all their families,\r\nwandering about in different directions on the banks of the river\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\nAt first this intelligence was lightly treated by our people, because\r\nthey were not in the habit of hearing of any wars in those remote\r\ndistricts till they were terminated either by victory or by treaty.\r\n\r\nBut presently, as the belief in these occurrences grew stronger, being\r\nconfirmed, too, by the arrival of the foreign ambassadors, who, with\r\nprayers and earnest entreaties, begged that the people thus driven from\r\ntheir homes and now encamped on the other side of the river might be\r\nkindly received by us, the affair seemed a cause of joy rather than of\r\nfear, according to the skilful flatterers who were always extolling and\r\nexaggerating the good fortune of the Emperor; congratulating him that an\r\nembassy had come from the farthest corners of the earth unexpectedly,\r\noffering him a large body of recruits; and that, by combining the\r\nstrength of his own nation with these foreign forces, he would have an\r\narmy absolutely invincible; observing further that, by the yearly\r\npayment for military reinforcements which came in every year from the\r\nprovinces, a vast treasure of gold might be accumulated in his coffers.\r\n\r\nFull of this hope, he sent forth several officers to bring this\r\nferocious people and their wagons into our territory. And such great\r\npains were taken to gratify this nation which was destined to overthrow\r\nthe Empire of Rome, that not one was left behind, not even of those who\r\nwere stricken with mortal disease. Moreover, having obtained permission\r\nof the Emperor to cross the Danube and to cultivate some districts in\r\nThrace, they crossed the stream day and night, without ceasing,\r\nembarking in troops on board ships and rafts, and canoes made of the\r\nhollow trunks of trees, in which enterprise, as the Danube is the most\r\ndifficult of all rivers to navigate, and was at that time swollen with\r\ncontinual rains, a great many were drowned, who, because they were too\r\nnumerous for the vessels, tried to swim across, and in spite of all\r\ntheir exertions were swept away by the stream.\r\n\r\nIn this way, through the turbulent zeal of violent people, the ruin of\r\nthe Roman Empire was brought on. This, at all events, is neither obscure\r\nnor uncertain that the unhappy officers who were intrusted with the\r\ncharge of conducting the multitude of the barbarians across the river,\r\nthough they repeatedly endeavored to calculate their numbers, at last\r\nabandoned the attempt as hopeless; and the man who would wish to\r\nascertain the number might as well--as the most illustrious of poets\r\nsays--attempt to count the waves in the African Sea, or the grains of\r\nsand tossed about by the zephyrs.\r\n\r\nLet, however, the ancient annals be accredited which record that the\r\nPersian host which was led into Greece was, while encamped on the shores\r\nof the Hellespont, and making a new and artificial sea, numbered in\r\nbattalions at Doriscus; a computation which has been unanimously\r\nregarded by all posterity as fabulous.\r\n\r\nBut after the innumerable multitudes of different nations, diffused over\r\nall our provinces and spreading themselves over the vast expanses of our\r\nplains, who filled all the champaign country and all the mountain\r\nranges, are considered, the credibility of the ancient accounts is\r\nconfirmed by this modern instance. And first of all Tritigernus was\r\nreceived with Alavivus, and the Emperor assigned them a temporary\r\nprovision for their immediate support, and ordered lands to be assigned\r\nthem to cultivate.\r\n\r\nAt that time the defences of our provinces were much exposed, and the\r\narmies of barbarians spread over them like the lava of Mount Ætna. The\r\nimminence of our danger manifestly called for generals already\r\nillustrious for their past achievements in war; but nevertheless, as if\r\nsome unpropitious deity had made the selection, the men who were sought\r\nout for the chief military appointments were of tainted character. The\r\nchief among them were Lupicinus and Maximus, the one being count of\r\nThrace, the other a leader notoriously wicked--and both men of great\r\nignorance and rashness.\r\n\r\nAnd their treacherous covetousness was the cause of all our disasters.\r\nFor--to pass over other matters in which the officers aforesaid, or\r\nothers with their unblushing connivance, displayed the greatest\r\nprofligacy in their injurious treatment of the foreigners dwelling in\r\nour territory, against whom no crime could be alleged--this one\r\nmelancholy and unprecedented piece of conduct--which, even if they were\r\nto choose their own judges, must appear wholly unpardonable--must be\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\nWhen the barbarians who had been conducted across the river were in\r\ngreat distress from want of provisions, those detested generals\r\nconceived the idea of a most disgraceful traffic; and having collected\r\nhounds from all quarters with the most unsatiable rapacity, they\r\nexchanged them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were several\r\nsons of men of noble birth.\r\n\r\nAbout this time also, Vitheric, the King of the Gruthungi, with Alatheus\r\nand Saphrax, by whose influence he was mainly guided, and also with\r\nFarnobius, approached the bank of the Danube and sent envoys to the\r\nEmperor to entreat that he also might be received with the same kindness\r\nthat Alavivus and Fritigern had experienced.\r\n\r\nBut when, as seemed best for the interests of the State, these\r\nambassadors had been rejected, and were in great anxiety what they\r\nshould do, Athanaric, fearing similar treatment, departed, recollecting\r\nthat long ago, when he was discussing a treaty with Valens, he had\r\ntreated that Emperor with contempt in affirming that he was bound by a\r\nreligious obligation never to set his foot on the Roman territory; and\r\nthat, by this excuse, he had compelled the Emperor to conclude a peace\r\nin the middle of the war. And he, fearing that the grudge which Valens\r\nbore him for this conduct was still lasting, withdrew with all his\r\nforces to Caucalandes, a place which, from the height of its mountains\r\nand the thickness of its woods, is completely inaccessible; and from\r\nwhich he had lately driven out the Sarmatians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL DIVISION OF ROMAN EMPIRE: THE DISRUPTIVE INTRIGUES\r\n\r\nA.D. 395\r\n\r\nJ. B. BURY\r\n\r\n     When Theodosius I, surnamed \"the Great,\" was elevated to power as\r\n     ruler of the East, that part of the empire was distracted in\r\n     consequence of wars with the Visigoths who, flying from the Huns,\r\n     had been granted a refuge in the Roman provinces of Moesia and\r\n     Thrace. Ill-treatment by the Romans drove the Visigoths to revolt,\r\n     and Valens, then Emperor of the East, set out with an army to\r\n     punish them. In the battle of Adrianople, August 9, 378, the Roman\r\n     army was defeated, and in the retreat Valens was killed. The\r\n     Visigoths pressed on, ravaging the country even to the foot of the\r\n     walls of Constantinople, and the doom of the empire seemed to be at\r\n     hand.\r\n\r\n     At this juncture Gratian--Emperor of the West, who also upon the\r\n     death of Valens succeeded him as ruler of the East--sent for\r\n     Theodosius, then a Roman general living in retirement in Spain,\r\n     made him his colleague in the East, and placed him, A.D., 379 at\r\n     the head of an army for the suppression of the Gothic outbreaks.\r\n     Theodosius enabled his soldiers to regain their lost confidence by\r\n     waging a successful _guerilla_ war with the marauding Goths; but\r\n     having thus shown his mastery over their straggling bands, he did\r\n     not undertake to drive them out from Roman territory, but weakened\r\n     them by causing them to quarrel among themselves; then, showing\r\n     himself as their friend, he gave them lands and settled them within\r\n     definite limits. To the Visigoths, or West Goths, he gave Thrace,\r\n     and to the Ostrogoths, or East Goths, who had also now poured into\r\n     the Roman provinces, he assigned Pannonia.\r\n\r\n     By this policy Theodosius established his authority in the East and\r\n     restored the empire to something of its earlier power. Except\r\n     during the last four months of his life, when he was sole Emperor,\r\n     his direct authority was confined to the East; but he exerted a\r\n     potent influence upon the affairs of the whole empire, both\r\n     temporal and spiritual. He warred steadily against paganism and\r\n     heresy. He took the side of Trinitarian orthodoxy against Arianism,\r\n     which had previously triumphed in the East, and restored religious\r\n     unity to the empire by making the Athanasian doctrine the faith of\r\n     Constantinople, as it was that of the West. This policy was\r\n     ratified by the second ecumenical council, called by Theodosius,\r\n     at Constantinople in 381, when the orthodoxy first promulgated by\r\n     the Council of Nicæa in 325 was substantially reaffirmed. It was\r\n     also largely through the influence of Theodosius, who was the\r\n     friend of Ambrose, archbishop of Milan, that the Roman senate, by a\r\n     great majority, voted (388) to abolish the worship of Jupiter and\r\n     to adopt the worship of Christ, thus making Christianity the state\r\n     religion. In the debate which preceded this transition the\r\n     eloquence of Symmachus, on the pagan side, was overmatched by the\r\n     arguments of Ambrose, aided by the powerful support of Theodosius\r\n     in person.\r\n\r\n     In his further dealings with the Visigoths, Theodosius, following a\r\n     precedent already established, enlisted in the Roman service a\r\n     separate Gothic army of forty thousand soldiers; but this policy,\r\n     as the event proved, was fatal to the permanency of his hitherto\r\n     successful control of these alien elements, for they soon gathered\r\n     strength to take the mastery into their own hands. Theodosius died\r\n     in 395, after publishing a decree for partition of the empire\r\n     between his two sons, Honorius to rule in the West, and Arcadius in\r\n     the East. He meant, not to establish two independent jurisdictions,\r\n     but that there should be one commonwealth, whose two rulers should\r\n     be colleagues and coadjutors in its defence. This new disposition\r\n     of the empire was followed by dissensions and intrigues against\r\n     which the weak sons of Theodosius were helpless in the hands of\r\n     able and unscrupulous self-seekers, the result of which was the\r\n     final separation of the empire into two distinct governments and\r\n     the weakening of the powers of resistance of both against those\r\n     ever-increasing encroachments of the barbarians which eventually\r\n     caused the fall of both empires.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the few men in history who have won the title of great, the\r\nemperor Theodosius I, who had by his policy, at once friendly and firm,\r\npacified the Goths, who had confirmed the triumph of Athanasian over\r\nArian Christianity, who had stamped out the last flames of refractory\r\npaganism represented by the tyrant Eugenius, died on the 17th of\r\nJanuary, A.D. 395. His wishes were that his younger son, Honorius, then\r\na boy of ten years, should reign in the West, where he had already\r\ninstalled him, and that his eldest son, Arcadius, whom he had left as\r\nregent in Constantinople when he set out against Eugenius, should\r\ncontinue to reign in the East.\r\n\r\nBut he was not willing to leave his youthful heirs--Arcadius was only\r\neighteen--without a protector, and the most natural protector was one\r\nbound to them by ties of relationship. Accordingly on his deathbed he\r\ncommended them to the care of the Vandal Stilicho, whom he had raised\r\nfor his military and other talents to the rank of commander-in-chief,\r\nand, deeming him worthy of an alliance with his own family, had united\r\nto his favorite niece Serena. We can hardly doubt that it was in this\r\ncapacity, as the husband of his niece and a trusted friend, not as a\r\ngeneral, that Stilicho received Theodosius' dying wishes; it was as an\r\nelder member of the same family that the husband of their cousin could\r\nclaim to exert an influence over Arcadius and Honorius, of whom,\r\nhowever, the latter, it would appear, was more especially committed to\r\nhis care, not only as the younger, but because Stilicho, being _magister\r\nmilitum_ of the armies of Italy, would come more directly into contact\r\nwith him than with his brother.\r\n\r\nArcadius, with whom we are especially concerned, was about eighteen at\r\nthe time of his father's death. He was of short stature, of dark\r\ncomplexion, thin and inactive, and the dulness of his wit was betrayed\r\nby his speech and by his eyes, which always seemed as if they were about\r\nto close in sleep. His smallness of intellect and his weakness of\r\ncharacter made it inevitable that he should come under the influence,\r\ngood or bad, of commanding personalities, with which he might be brought\r\nin contact. Such a potent personality was the prætorian prefect Rufinus,\r\na native of Aquitaine, who in almost every respect presented a contrast\r\nto his sovereign. He was tall and manly, and the restless movements of\r\nhis keen eyes and the readiness of his speech signified his intellectual\r\npowers. He was a strong, worldly man, ambitious of power, and\r\nsufficiently unprincipled; avaricious, too, like most ministers of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nHe had made many enemies by acts which were perhaps somewhat more than\r\nusually unscrupulous, but we cannot justly assume that in the overthrow\r\nof certain rivals he was entirely guilty and they entirely innocent, as\r\nis sometimes represented. It is almost certain that he formed the scheme\r\nand cherished the hope of becoming joint emperor with Arcadius.\r\n\r\nThis ambition of Rufinus placed him at once in an attitude of opposition\r\nto Stilicho, who was himself not above the suspicion of entertaining\r\nsimilar schemes, not, however, in the interest of his own person, but\r\nfor his son Eucherius. The position of the Vandal, who was connected by\r\nmarriage with the imperial family, gave him an advantage over Rufinus,\r\nwhich was strengthened by the generally known fact that Theodosius had\r\ngiven him his last instructions. Stilicho, moreover, was popular with\r\nthe army, and for the present the great bulk of the forces of the empire\r\nwas at his disposal; for the regiments united to suppress Eugenius had\r\nnot yet been sent back to their various stations. Thus a struggle was\r\nimminent between the ambitious minister who had the ear of Arcadius, and\r\nthe strong general who held the command and enjoyed the favor of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year this struggle began and concluded in an\r\nextremely curious way; but we must first relate how a certain scheme of\r\nRufinus had been checkmated by an obscurer but wilier rival nearer at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt was the cherished project of Rufinus to unite Arcadius with his only\r\ndaughter; once the Emperor's father-in-law, he might hope to become\r\nspeedily an emperor himself. But he imprudently made a journey to\r\nAntioch, in order to execute vengeance personally on the Count of the\r\nEast, who had offended him; and during his absence from Byzantium an\r\nadversary stole a march on him. This adversary was the eunuch Eutropius,\r\nthe lord chamberlain, a bald old man, who with oriental craftiness had\r\nwon his way up from the meanest services and employments. Determining\r\nthat the future Empress should be bound to himself and not to Rufinus,\r\nhe chose Eudoxia, a girl of singular beauty, the daughter of a\r\ndistinguished Frank, but herself of Roman education.\r\n\r\nHer father, Bauto, was dead, and she lived in the house of the widow and\r\nsons of one of the victims of Rufinus. Eutropius showed a picture of the\r\nFrank maiden to the Emperor and engaged his affections for her; the\r\nnuptials were arranged by the time Rufinus returned to Constantinople,\r\nand were speedily celebrated (April 27, 395). This was a blow to\r\nRufinus, but he was still the most powerful man in the East.\r\n\r\nThe event which at length brought him into contact with Stilicho was the\r\nrising of the Visigoths, who had been settled by Theodosius in Moesia\r\nand Thrace, and were bound in return for their lands to serve in the\r\narmy as _foederati_. They had accompanied the Emperor to Italy against\r\nEugenius, and had returned to their habitations sooner than the rest of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nThe causes of discontent which led to their revolt are not quite clear;\r\nbut it seems that Arcadius refused to give them certain grants of money\r\nwhich had been allowed them by his father, and, as has been suggested,\r\nthey probably expected that favor would wane and influence decrease now\r\nthat the \"friend of Goths\" was dead, and consequently determined to make\r\nthemselves heard and felt. To this must be added that their most\r\ninfluential chieftain, Alaric, called Baltha (\"the Bold\"), desired to be\r\nmade a commander-in-chief, _magister militum_, and was offended that he\r\nhad been passed over.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the historical essence of the matter is that an\r\nimmense body of restless, uncivilized Germans could not abide\r\npermanently in the centre of Roman provinces in a semi-dependent,\r\nill-defined relation to the Roman government; the West Goths had not yet\r\nfound their permanent home. Under the leadership of Alaric they raised\r\nthe ensign of revolt, and spread desolation in the fields and homesteads\r\nof Macedonia, Moesia, and Thrace, even advancing close to the walls of\r\nConstantinople. They carefully spared certain estates outside the city,\r\nbelonging to the prefect Rufinus, but this policy does not seem to have\r\nbeen adopted with the same motive that caused Archidamus to spare the\r\nlands of Pericles. Alaric may have wished not to render Rufinus\r\nsuspected, but to conciliate his friendship and obtain thereby more\r\nfavorable terms. Rufinus actually went to Alaric's camp, dressed as a\r\nGoth, but the interview led to nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to take the field against the Goths, because there\r\nwere no forces available, as the eastern armies were still with Stilicho\r\nin the West. Arcadius therefore was obliged to summon Stilicho to send\r\nor bring them back immediately, to protect his throne. This summons gave\r\nthat general the desired opportunity to interfere in the politics of\r\nConstantinople; and having with energetic celerity arranged matters on\r\nthe Gallic frontier, he marched overland through Illyricum and\r\nconfronted Alaric in Thessaly, whither the Goth had traced his\r\ndevastating path from the Propontis.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Stilicho's behavior is quite as open to the charges of\r\nambition and artfulness as the behavior of Rufinus, for I do not\r\nperceive how we can strictly justify his detention of the forces, which\r\nought to have been sent back to defend the provinces of Arcadius at the\r\nvery beginning of the year. Stilicho's march to Thessaly can scarcely\r\nhave taken place before October, and it is hard to interpret this long\r\ndelay in sending back the troops, over which he had no rightful\r\nauthority, if it were not dictated by a wish to implicate the government\r\nof New Rome in difficulties and render his own intervention necessary.\r\n\r\nWe are told, too, that he selected the best soldiers from the eastern\r\nregiments and enrolled them in the western corps. If we adopted the\r\nCassian maxim, _Cui bono fuerit_, we should be inclined to accuse\r\nStilicho of having been privy to the revolt of Alaric; such a\r\nsupposition would at least be far more plausible than the calumny which\r\nwas circulated charging Rufinus with having stirred up the Visigoths.\r\nFor such a supposition, too, we might find support in the circumstance\r\nthat the estates of Rufinus were spared by the soldiers of Alaric; it\r\nwould be intelligible that Stilicho suggested the plan in order to bring\r\nodium upon Rufinus. To such a conjecture, finally, certain other\r\ncircumstances, soon to be related, point: but it remains nothing more\r\nthan a suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt seems that before Stilicho arrived Alaric had experienced a defeat at\r\nthe hands of garrison soldiers in Thessaly; at all events he shut\r\nhimself up in a fortified camp and declined to engage with the Roman\r\ngeneral. In the mean time Rufinus induced Arcadius to send a peremptory\r\norder to Stilicho to despatch the eastern troops to Constantinople and\r\ndepart himself whence he had come; the Emperor resented, or pretended to\r\nresent, the presence of his cousin as an officious interference.\r\nStilicho yielded so readily that his willingness seems almost\r\nsuspicious; but we shall probably never know whether he was responsible\r\nfor the events that followed. He consigned the eastern soldiers to the\r\ncommand of a Gothic captain, Gainas, and himself departed to Salona,\r\nallowing Alaric to proceed on his wasting way into the lands of Hellas.\r\n\r\nGainas and his soldiers marched by the Via Egnatia to Constantinople,\r\nand it was arranged that, according to a usual custom, the Emperor and\r\nhis court should come forth from the city to meet the army in the Campus\r\nMartius, which extended on the west side of the city near the Golden\r\nGate. We cannot trust the statement of a hostile writer that Rufinus\r\nactually expected to be created augustus on this occasion, and appeared\r\nat the Emperor's side prouder and more sumptuously arrayed than ever; we\r\nonly know that he accompanied Arcadius to meet the army.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, when the Emperor had saluted the troops, Rufinus\r\nadvanced and displayed a studied affability and solicitude to please\r\ntoward even individual soldiers. They closed in round him as he smiled\r\nand talked, anxious to secure their good-will for his elevation to the\r\nthrone, but just as he felt himself very nigh to supreme success, the\r\nswords of the nearest were drawn, and his body, pierced with wounds,\r\nfell to the ground. His head, carried through the streets, was mocked by\r\nthe people, and his right hand, severed from the trunk, was presented at\r\nthe doors of houses with the request: \"Give to the insatiable!\"\r\n\r\nWe can hardly suppose that the lynching of Rufinus was the fatal\r\ninspiration of a moment, but whether it was proposed or approved of by\r\nStilicho, or was a plan hatched among the soldiers on their way to\r\nConstantinople, is uncertain. One might even conjecture that the whole\r\naffair was the result of a prearrangement between Stilicho and the party\r\nin Byzantium, which was adverse to Rufinus and led by the eunuch\r\nEutropius; but there is no evidence. Our knowledge of this scene\r\nunfortunately depends on a partial and untrustworthy writer, who,\r\nmoreover, wrote in verse--the poet Claudian.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed the patronage of Stilicho, and his poems _Against Rufinus_,\r\n_Against Eutropius_, and _On the Gothic War_ are a glorification of his\r\npatron's splendid virtues. Stilicho and Rufinus he paints as two\r\nopposite forces, the force of good and the force of evil, like the\r\nprinciples of the Manichæans.\r\n\r\nRufinus is the terrible Pytho, the scourge of the world; Stilicho is the\r\nradiant Apollo, the deliverer of mankind. Rufinus is a power of\r\ndarkness, whose tartarean wickedness surpasses even the wickedness of\r\nthe Furies of hell; Stilicho is an angel of light. In the works of a\r\npoet whose leading idea was so extravagant, we can hardly expect to find\r\nmuch fair historical truth; it is, as a rule, only accidental references\r\nand allusions that we can accept, unless other authorities confirm his\r\nstatements. Yet even modern writers, who know well how cautiously\r\nClaudian must be used, have been unconsciously prejudiced in favor of\r\nStilicho and against Rufinus.\r\n\r\nWe must return to the movements of Alaric, who had entered the regions\r\nof classical Greece, for which he showed scant respect. The commander of\r\nthe garrison at Thermopylæ, and the proconsul of Achaia, offered no\r\nresistance, and the West Goths entered Boeotia, where Thebes alone\r\nescaped their devastation. They occupied the Piræus, but Athens itself\r\nwas spared, and Alaric was entertained as a guest in the city of Athene.\r\nBut the great temple of the mystic goddesses Demeter and Persephone, at\r\nEleusis, was burned down by the irreverent barbarians; Megara, the next\r\nplace on their southward route, fell; then Corinth, Argos, and Sparta.\r\n\r\nBut when they reached Elis they were confronted by an unexpected\r\nopponent. Stilicho had returned from Italy, by way of Salona, which he\r\nreached by sea, to stay the hand of the invader. He blockaded him in the\r\nplain of Pholoe, but for some reason, not easily comprehensible, he\r\ndid not press his advantage, and set free the hordes of the Visigothic\r\nland pirates to resume their career of devastation. He went back to\r\nItaly, and Alaric returned, plundering as he went, to Illyricum and\r\nThrace, where he made terms with the government of New Rome, and\r\nreceived the desired title of _magister militum per Illyricum_. No one\r\nwill suppose that Stilicho went all the way from Italy to the\r\nPeloponnesus, and then, although he had Alaric practically at his mercy,\r\nretreated, leaving matters just as they were, without some excellent\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIf he had genuinely wished to deliver the distressed countries and\r\nassist the emperor Arcadius, he would not have acted in this ineffectual\r\nmanner. And it is difficult to see that his conduct is explained by\r\nassuming that he was not willing, by a complete extermination of the\r\nGoths, to enable Arcadius to dispense with his help in future. In that\r\ncase, what did he gain by going to the Peloponnesus at all? Or we might\r\nask, if he wished Arcadius to summon his assistance from year to year,\r\nis it likely that he would have adopted the method of rendering no\r\nassistance whatever? But, above all, the question occurs, what pleasure\r\nwould it have been to the general to look forward to being called upon\r\nagain and again to take the field against the Visigoths?\r\n\r\nIt seems evident that Stilicho and Alaric made at Pholoe some secret\r\nand definite arrangement, which conditioned Stilicho's departure, and\r\nthat this arrangement was conducive to the interests of Stilicho, who\r\nwas in the position of advantage, and at the same time not contrary to\r\nthe interests of Alaric, for otherwise Stilicho could not have been sure\r\nthat the agreement would be carried out. What this secret compact was\r\ncan only be a matter of conjecture; but I would suggest that Stilicho\r\nhad already formed the plan of creating his son Eucherius emperor, and\r\nthat he designed the Balkan peninsula to be the dominion over which\r\nEucherius should hold sway. His conduct becomes perfectly explicable if\r\nwe assume that by a secret agreement he secured Alaric's assistance for\r\nthe execution of this scheme, which the preponderance of Gothic power in\r\nIllyricum and Thrace would facilitate.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the European parts of Arcadius' dominions that were\r\nravaged in 395, by the fire and sword of barbarians. In the same year\r\nhordes of trans-Caucasian Huns poured through the Caspian gates, and,\r\nrushing southward through the provinces of Mesopotamia, carried\r\ndesolation into Syria. St. Jerome was in Palestine at this time, and in\r\ntwo of his letters we have the account of an eye-witness: \"As I was\r\nsearching for an abode worthy of such a lady (Fabiola, his friend),\r\nbehold, suddenly messengers rush hither and thither, and the whole East\r\ntrembles with the news that from the far Mæotis, from the land of the\r\nice-bound Don and the savage Massagetæ, where the strong works of\r\nAlexander on the Caucasian cliffs keep back the wild nations, swarms of\r\nHuns had burst forth, and, flying hither and thither, were scattering\r\nslaughter and terror everywhere. The Roman army was at that time, absent\r\nin consequence of the civil wars in Italy.... May Jesus protect the\r\nRoman world in future from such beasts! They were everywhere, when they\r\nwere least expected, and their speed outstripped the rumor of their\r\napproach; they spared neither religion nor dignity nor age; they showed\r\nno pity to the cry of infancy.\r\n\r\n\"Babes, who had not yet begun to live, were forced to die; and, ignorant\r\nof the evil that was upon them, as they were held in the hands and\r\nthreatened by the swords of the enemy, there was a smile upon their\r\nlips. There was a consistent and universal report that Jerusalem was the\r\ngoal of the foes, and that on account of their insatiable lust for gold\r\nthey were hastening to this city. The walls, neglected by the\r\ncarelessness of peace, were repaired. Antioch was enduring a blockade.\r\nTyre, fain to break off from the dry land, sought its ancient island.\r\nThen we too were constrained to provide ships, to stay on the sea-shore,\r\nto take precautions against the arrival of the enemy, and, though the\r\nwinds were wild, to fear a shipwreck less than the barbarians--making\r\nprovision not for our own safety so much as for the chastity of our\r\nvirgins.\" In another letter, speaking of these \"wolves of the north,\" he\r\nsays: \"How many monasteries were captured? The waters of how many rivers\r\nwere stained with human gore? Antioch was besieged and the other cities,\r\npast which the Halys, the Cydnus, the Orontes, the Euphrates flow. Herds\r\nof captives were dragged away; Arabia, Phoenicia, Palestine, Egypt,\r\nwere led captive by fear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Huns, however, were not the only depredators at whose hands the\r\nprovinces of Asia Minor and Syria suffered. There were other enemies\r\nwithin, whose ravages were constant, while the expedition of the Huns\r\nfrom without occurred only once. These enemies were the freebooters who\r\ndwelt in the Isaurian mountains, wild and untamed in their secure\r\nfastnesses. Ammianus Marcellinus describes picturesquely the habits of\r\nthese sturdy robbers. They used to descend from the difficult mountain\r\nslopes like a whirlwind to places on the sea-shore, where in hidden ways\r\nand glens they lurked till the fall of night, and in the light of the\r\ncrescent moon watched until the mariners riding at anchor slept; then\r\nthey boarded the vessels, killed and plundered the crews. Thus the coast\r\nof Isauria was like a deadly shore of Sciron; it was avoided by sailors,\r\nwho made a practice of putting in at the safer ports of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nThe Isaurians did not always confine their land expeditions to the\r\nsurrounding provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia; they penetrated, in A.D.\r\n403, northward to Cappadocia and Pontus, or southward to Syria and\r\nPalestine; and the whole range of the Taurus, as far as the confines of\r\nSyria, seems to have been their spacious habitation. An officer named\r\nArbacazius was intrusted by Arcadius with an office similar in object to\r\nthat which, four and a half centuries ago, had been assigned to\r\nPompeius; but, though he quelled the spirits of the freebooters for a\r\nmoment, Arbacazius did not succeed in eradicating the lawless element,\r\nin the same way as Pompeius had succeeded in exterminating the piracy\r\nwhich in his day infested the same regions. In the years 404 and 405\r\nCappadocia was overrun by the robber bands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after the death of Rufinus, the weak emperor Arcadius passed\r\nunder the influence of the eunuch Eutropius, who, in unscrupulous greed\r\nof money, resembled Rufinus and many other officials of the time, and,\r\nlike Rufinus, has been painted far blacker than he really was. All the\r\nevil things that were said by his enemies of Rufinus were said of\r\nEutropius by his enemies; but in reading of the enormities of the latter\r\nwe must make great allowance for the general prejudice existing against\r\na person with Eutropius' physical disqualifications.\r\n\r\nEutropius naturally looked on the prætorian prefects, the most powerful\r\nmen in the administration next to the Emperor, with jealousy and\r\nsuspicion, as dangerous rivals. It was his interest to reduce their\r\npower and to raise the dignity of his own office to an equality with\r\ntheirs. To his influence, then, we are probably justified in ascribing\r\ntwo innovations which were made by Arcadius. The administration of the\r\n_cursus publicus_, or office of postmaster-general, was transferred from\r\nthe prætorian prefects to the master of offices, and the same\r\ntransferrence was made in regard to the manufactories of arms. On the\r\nother hand, the grand chamberlain, _præpositus sacri cubiculi_, was made\r\nan _illustris_, equal in rank to the prætorian prefects. Both these\r\ninnovations were afterward altered.\r\n\r\nThe general historical import of the position of Eutropius is that the\r\nempire was falling into a danger, by which it had been threatened from\r\nthe outset, and which it had been ever trying to avoid. We may say that\r\nthere were two dangers which constantly impended over the Roman Empire\r\nfrom its inauguration by Augustus to its redintegration by Diocletian--a\r\nScylla and Charybdis, between which it had to steer. The one was a\r\ncabinet of imperial freedmen, the other was a military despotism. The\r\nformer danger called forth, and was counteracted by, the creation of a\r\ncivil service system, to which Hadrian perhaps made the most important\r\ncontributions, and which was finally elaborated by Diocletian, who at\r\nthe same time averted the other danger by separating the military and\r\ncivil administrations. But both dangers revived in a new form. The\r\ndanger from the army became danger from the Germans, who preponderated\r\nin it; and the institution of court ceremonial tended to create a\r\ncabinet of chamberlains and imperial dependents.\r\n\r\nThis oriental ceremonial, so marked a feature of late \"Byzantinism,\"\r\ninvolved, as one of its principles, difficulty of access to the Emperor,\r\nwho, living in the retirement of his palace, was tempted to trust less\r\nto his eyes than his ears, and saw too little of public affairs.\r\nDiocletian appreciated this disadvantage himself, and remarked that the\r\nsovereign, shut up in his palace, cannot know the truth, but must rely\r\non what his attendants and officers tell him. We may also remark that\r\nabsolute monarchy, by its very nature, tends in this direction; for\r\nabsolute monarchy naturally tends to a dynasty, and a dynasty implies\r\nthat there must sooner or later come to the throne weak men,\r\ninexperienced in public affairs, reared up in an atmosphere of flattery\r\nand illusion, easily guided by intriguing chamberlains and eunuchs.\r\nUnder such conditions, then, aulic cabals and chamber cabinets are sure\r\nto become dominant sometimes. Diocletian, whose political insight and\r\ningenuity were remarkable, tried to avoid the dangers of a dynasty by\r\nhis artificial system, but artifice could not contend with success\r\nagainst nature.\r\n\r\nThe greatest blot on the ministry of Eutropius--for, as he was the most\r\ntrusted adviser of the Emperor, we may use the word ministry--was the\r\nsale of offices, of which Claudian gives a vivid and exaggerated\r\naccount. This was a blot, however, that stained other men of those days\r\nas well as Eutropius, and we must view it rather as a feature of the\r\ntimes than as a personal enormity. Of course, the eunuch's spies were\r\nubiquitous; of course, informers of all sorts were encouraged and\r\nrewarded. All the usual stratagems for grasping and plundering were put\r\ninto practice.\r\n\r\nThe strong measures that a determined minister was ready to take for the\r\nmere sake of vengeance may be exemplified by a treatment which the whole\r\nLycian province received at the hands of Rufinus. On account of a single\r\nindividual, Tatian, who had offended that minister, all the provincials\r\nwere excluded from public offices. After the death of Rufinus, the\r\nLycians were relieved from these disabilities; but the fact that the\r\nedict of emancipation expressly enjoins \"that no one henceforward\r\nventure to wound a Lycian citizen with a name of scorn\" shows what a\r\nserious misfortune their degradation was.\r\n\r\nThe eunuch won considerable odium in the first year of his power (396)\r\nby bringing about the fall of two men of distinction--Abundantius, to\r\nwhose patronage he owed his rise in the world, and Timasius, who had\r\nbeen the commander-general in the East. An account of the manner in\r\nwhich the ruin of the latter was wrought will illustrate the sort of\r\nintrigues that were spun at the Byzantine court.\r\n\r\nTimasius had brought with him from Sardis a Syrian sausage-seller, named\r\nBargus, who, with native address, had insinuated himself into his good\r\ngraces and obtained a subordinate command in the army. The prying\r\nomniscience of Eutropius discovered that, years before, this same Bargus\r\nhad been forbidden to enter Constantinople for some misdemeanor, and by\r\nmeans of this knowledge he gained an ascendency over the Syrian, and\r\ncompelled him to accuse his benefactor, Timasius, of a treasonable\r\nconspiracy, supporting the charge by forgeries. The accused was tried,\r\ncondemned, and banished to the Lybian oasis, a punishment equivalent to\r\ndeath; he was never heard of more. Eutropius, foreseeing that the\r\ncontinued existence of Bargus might at some time compromise himself,\r\nsuborned his wife to lodge very serious charges against her husband, in\r\nconsequence of which he was put to death. Whether Eutropius then got rid\r\nof the wife we are not informed.\r\n\r\nAmong the adherents of Eutropius, who were equally numerous and\r\ninsincere, two were of especial importance--Osius, who had risen from\r\nthe post of a cook to be count of the sacred largesses, and finally\r\nmaster of the offices, and Leo, a soldier, corpulent and good-humored,\r\nwho was known by the sobriquet of Ajax, a man of great body and little\r\nmind, fond of boasting, fond of eating, fond of drinking, and fond of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Eutropius had many enemies, and enemies in two\r\ndifferent quarters. Romans of the stamp of Timasius and Aurelian were\r\nnaturally opposed to the supremacy of an emasculated chamberlain; while,\r\nas we shall see subsequently, the German element in the empire,\r\nrepresented by Gainas, was also inimical. It seems certain that a\r\nserious confederacy was formed in the year 397, aiming at the overthrow\r\nof Eutropius. Though this is not stated by any writer, it seems an\r\ninevitable conclusion from the law which was passed in the autumn of\r\nthat year, assessing the penalty of death to anyone who had conspired\r\n\"with soldiers or private persons, including barbarians,\" against the\r\nlives \"of _illustres_ who belong to our consistory or assist at our\r\ncounsels,\" or other senators, such a conspiracy being considered\r\nequivalent to treason. Intent was to be regarded as equivalent to crime,\r\nand not only did the individual concerned incur capital punishment, but\r\nhis descendants were visited with disfranchisement.\r\n\r\nIt is generally recognized that this law was an express palladium for\r\nchamberlains; but surely it must have been suggested by some actually\r\nformed conspiracy, of which Eutropius discovered the threads before it\r\nwas carried out. The particular mention of soldiers and barbarians\r\npoints to a particular danger, and we may suspect that Gainas, who\r\nafterward brought about the fall of Eutropius, had some connection with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhile the eunuch was sailing in the full current of success at\r\nByzantium, the Vandal Stilicho was enjoying an uninterrupted course of\r\nprosperity in the somewhat less stifling air of Italy. The poet\r\nClaudian, who acted as a sort of poet-laureate to Honorius, was really\r\nan apologist for Stilicho, who patronized and paid him. Almost every\r\npublic poem he produced is an extravagant panegyric on that general, and\r\nwe cannot but suspect that many of his utterances were direct\r\nmanifestoes suggested by his patron. In the panegyric in honor of the\r\nthird consulate of Honorius (396), which, composed soon after the death\r\nof Rufinus, breathes a spirit of concord between East and West, the\r\nwriter calls upon Stilicho \"to protect with his right hand the two\r\nbrothers\" (_geminos dextra tu protege fratres_).\r\n\r\nSuch lines as this are written to put a certain significance on\r\nStilicho's policy. In the panegyric in honor of the fourth consulate of\r\nHonorius (398) he gives an absolutely false and misleading account of\r\nStilicho's expedition to Greece two years before, an account which no\r\nallowance for poetical exaggeration can defend. At the same time he\r\nextols Honorius with the most absurd eulogiums, and overwhelms him with\r\nthe most extravagant adulations, making out the boy of fourteen to be\r\ngreater than his father and grandfather. If Claudian were not a poet, we\r\nshould say that he was a most outrageous liar. We are therefore unable\r\nto accord him the smallest credit when he boasts that the subjects in\r\nthe western provinces are not oppressed by heavy taxes and that the\r\ntreasury is not replenished by extortion.\r\n\r\nStilicho and Eutropius had shaken hands over the death of Rufinus, but\r\nthe good understanding was not destined to last longer than the song of\r\ntriumph. We cannot justly blame Eutropius for this. No minister of\r\nArcadius could regard with good-will or indifference the desire of\r\nStilicho to interfere in the affairs of New Rome; for this desire cannot\r\nbe denied, even if one do not accept the theory that the scheme of\r\ndetaching Illyricum from Arcadius' dominion was entertained by him at as\r\nearly a date as 396. His position as master of soldier in Italy gave him\r\nno power in other parts of the empire; and the attitude which he assumed\r\nas an elderly relative, solicitously concerned for the welfare of his\r\nwife's young cousin, in obedience to the wishes of that cousin's father,\r\nwas untenable, when it led him to exceed the acts of a strictly private\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nWe can then well understand the indignation felt at New Rome, not only\r\nby Eutropius, but probably also by men of a quite different faction,\r\nwhen the news arrived that Stilicho purposed to visit Constantinople to\r\nset things in order and arrange matters for Arcadius. Such officiousness\r\nwas intolerable, and it was plain that the strongest protest must be\r\nmade against it. The senate accordingly passed a resolution declaring\r\nStilicho a public enemy. This action of the senate is very remarkable,\r\nand its signification is not generally perceived. If the act had been\r\naltogether due to Eutropius, it would surely have taken the form of an\r\nimperial decree. Eutropius would not have resorted to the troublesome\r\nmethod of bribing or threatening the whole senate even if he had been\r\nable to do so. We must conclude then that the general feeling against\r\nStilicho was strong, and we must confess naturally strong.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now complicated by a revolt in Africa, which\r\neventually proved highly fortunate for the glory and influence of\r\nStilicho.\r\n\r\nEighteen years before, the Moor Firmus had made an attempt to create a\r\nkingdom for himself in the African provinces (A.D. 379), and had been\r\nquelled by the arms of Theodosius, who received important assistance\r\nfrom Gildo, the brother and enemy of Firmus. Gildo was duly rewarded. He\r\nwas finally military commander, or Count, of Africa, and his daughter\r\nSalvina was united in marriage to a nephew of the empress Ælia\r\nFlaccilla. But the faith of the Moors was as the faith of Carthaginians.\r\nGildo refused to send aid to Theodosius in his expedition against\r\nEugenius.\r\n\r\nAfter Theodosius' death he prepared to take a more positive attitude,\r\nand he engaged numerous African nomad tribes to support him in his\r\nrevolt. The strained relations between Old and New Rome, which did not\r\nescape his notice, suggested to him that his rebellion might assume the\r\nform of a transition from the sovereignty of Honorius to the sovereignty\r\nof Arcadius. He knew that if he were dependent only on New Rome he would\r\nbe practically independent. He entered accordingly into communication\r\nwith the government of Arcadius, but the negotiations came to nothing.\r\nIt appears that Gildo demanded that Lybia should be consigned to his\r\nrule, and he certainly took possession of it. It also appears that\r\nembassies on the subject passed between Italy and Constantinople, and\r\nthat Symmachus the orator was one of the ambassadors. But it is certain\r\nthat Arcadius did not in any way assist Gildo, and the comparatively\r\nslight and moderate references which the hostile Claudius makes to the\r\nhesitating attitude of New Rome indicate that the government of\r\nAlexandrius did not behave very badly after all.\r\n\r\nWe need not go into the details of the Gildonic war, through which\r\nStilicho won well-deserved laurels, although he did not take the field\r\nhimself. What made the revolt of the Count of Africa of such great\r\nmoment was the fact that the African provinces were the granary of Old\r\nRome, as Egypt was the granary of New Rome. By stopping the supplies of\r\ncorn, Gildo might hope to starve out Italy. The prompt action and\r\nefficient management of Stilicho, however, prevented any catastrophe;\r\nfor ships from Gaul and from Spain, laden with corn, appeared in the\r\nTiber, and Rome was supplied during the winter months. Early in 398 a\r\nfleet sailed against the tyrant, whose hideous cruelties and oppressions\r\nwere worthy of his Moorish blood; and it is a curious fact that this\r\nfleet was under the command of Mascezel, Gildo's brother, who was now\r\nplaying the same part toward Gildo that Gildo had played toward his\r\nbrother Firmus. The undisciplined nomadic army of the rebel was\r\nscattered without labor at Ardalio, and Africa was delivered from the\r\nMoor's reign of ruin and terror, to which Roman rule, with all its\r\nfiscal sternness, was peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis subjugation of the man whom the senate of Old Rome had pronounced a\r\npublic enemy redounded far and wide to the glory of the man whom the\r\nsenate of New Rome had proclaimed a public enemy. And in the mean time\r\nStilicho's position had become still more splendid and secure by the\r\nmarriage of his daughter Maria with the emperor Honorius (398), for\r\nwhich an epithalamium was written by Claudian, who, as we might expect,\r\ncelebrates the father-in-law as expressly as the bridal pair. The\r\nGildonic war also supplied, we need hardly remark, a grateful material\r\nfor his favorite theme; and the year 400, to which Stilicho gave his\r\nname of consul, inspired an enthusiastic effusion.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that now, almost at the zenith of his fame, the\r\nfather-in-law of the Emperor and the hero of the Gildonic war did not\r\nmake some attempt to carry out his favorite project of interfering with\r\nthe government of the eastern provinces. But there are two\r\nconsiderations which may help to explain this.\r\n\r\nIn the first place Stilicho himself was not the man of indomitable will\r\nwho forms a project and carries it through; he was a man rather of that\r\nambitious but hesitating character which Mommsen attributes to Pompey.\r\nHe was half a Roman and half a barbarian; he was half strong and half\r\nweak; he was half patriotic and half selfish. His intentions were\r\nunscrupulous, but he was almost afraid of them. Besides this, his wife,\r\nSerena, probably endeavored to check his policy of discord and maintain\r\nunity in the Theodosian house. In the second place, it is sufficiently\r\nprobable that he was in constant communication with Gainas, the German\r\ngeneral of the eastern armies and chief representative of the German\r\ninterests in the realm of Arcadius, and that Gainas was awaiting his\r\ntime for an outbreak, by which Stilicho hoped to profit and execute his\r\ndesigns. He had no excuse for interference, and he was willing to wait.\r\nHis inactive policy of the next two years must not be taken to indicate\r\nthat he cherished no ambitious projects.\r\n\r\nThe Germans looked up to Stilicho as the most important German in the\r\nempire; their natural protector and friend, while there was a large\r\nRoman faction opposed to him as a foreigner. But as yet this faction was\r\nnot strong enough to overpower him. It is remarkable that his fall was\r\nfinally brought about by the influence of a palace official (A.D. 408),\r\nwhile the fall of his rival Eutropius, which occurred far sooner (A.D.\r\n399), was brought about by the compulsion of a German general. These\r\nfacts indicate that the two dangers to which I have already called\r\nattention--the preponderating influence of chamberlains and\r\neunuchs--were mutually checks on each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nEMBRACING THE PERIOD COVERED IN THIS VOLUME\r\n\r\nA.D. 13-409\r\n\r\nJOHN RUDD, LL.
