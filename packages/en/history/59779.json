When I accepted the task, I knew that I had undertaken a\r\ndelightful but difficult piece of work, for it is no easy matter to\r\ndo justice to the achievements of a regiment which has fought in\r\nEurope, in Asia, in Africa, in America, and in Australasia. After\r\nserving with credit in William III.’s war in Ireland, the Royal\r\nIrish won undying laurels in the Siege of Namur in 1695. They formed\r\npart of the British contingent in the army commanded by Marlborough\r\nin the Low Countries and in Germany, and fought, not only at the\r\ngreat battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, but\r\nin the long series of desperate but now forgotten sieges by which\r\nfortress after fortress was wrested from the French. A detachment\r\ntook part in the defence of Gibraltar in 1727: the whole regiment\r\nwas involved in the disasters of the campaign of 1745: the flank\r\ncompanies encountered foemen worthy of their steel at Lexington and\r\nBunker’s Hill. In the first phase of the great war with France the\r\nRoyal Irish were in the Mediterranean: they served in the defence\r\nof Toulon; they helped Nelson and Moore to expel the French from\r\nCorsica, and they were sent to the mainland of Italy where for some\r\nmonths they established themselves firmly at Piombino, a port on\r\nthe Tuscan coast. A few years later they fought under Abercromby in\r\nEgypt, but then their good luck changed, for they were ordered to the\r\nWest Indies, where they remained till the end of the Napoleonic war.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the outbreak of the first war with China re-opened the gates\r\nof the Temple of Janus to the XVIIIth; and during the last sixty\r\nyears almost every decade has seen the regiment employed on active\r\nservice, for after the Chinese war came the second war in Burma; the\r\nCrimea; the Indian Mutiny; the New Zealand war; the second Afghan\r\nwar; the campaign of Tel-el-Kebir; the Nile expedition; campaigns\r\non the north-west frontier of India; and the war with the Dutch\r\nrepublics in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Committee had hoped that Field-Marshal Lord Wolseley\r\nwould have written a preface to the history of the regiment, with\r\nwhich throughout his military career he has been associated closely.\r\nIn Burma he won his spurs leading a charge of infantry among whom\r\nwere many of the Royal Irish; as an acting Engineer at the siege of\r\nSebastopol he frequently supervised the operations of the regiment in\r\nthe trenches; in the Tel-el-Kebir campaign and the Nile expedition\r\nthe Royal Irish formed part of the troops under his command; and\r\nfor the last thirteen years he has been their Colonel-in-Chief. Ill\r\nhealth unfortunately has prevented Lord Wolseley from writing at\r\nany length, but in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee, he\r\nexpressed his admiration for the regiment in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  “HAMPTON COURT PALACE, MIDDLESEX,\r\n  _19th June 1910_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GREGORIE,--I am indeed very glad to hear that the History of\r\nthe Royal Irish Regiment is soon to be published. Its story cannot\r\nfail to be a fine one. Every soldier who like myself, had the honour\r\nof fighting, I may say shoulder to shoulder with it, will read this\r\nnew work with the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nWere it to be my good fortune to lead a Storming party this afternoon\r\nI should indeed wish it were to be largely composed of your\r\ncelebrated corps.\r\n\r\n  Believe me to be,\r\n  Very sincerely yours,\r\n  WOLSELEY.”\r\n\r\n  “_To_ General C. F. GREGORIE, C.B.,\r\n  Royal Irish Regiment.”\r\n\r\nA lithographic reproduction of this letter will be found facing page\r\nviii.\r\n\r\nThis history has been prepared, not for the officers alone but for\r\nall ranks of the Royal Irish, and the Committee are supplying it to\r\nnon-commissioned officers and private soldiers at a price so low that\r\neven the last joined recruit can buy it, and read of the gallant\r\ndeeds of his predecessors in the regiment.\r\n\r\nAs I am fully impressed with the importance of recording the names,\r\nnot of the officers only, but of all members of the regiment who on\r\nactive service laid down their lives for their country, I have tried\r\nto mention in the Casualty appendix all ranks who were killed, or\r\ndied from the effects of wounds or sickness in the many wars in which\r\nthe Royal Irish have taken part. In the campaigns of the seventeenth\r\nand the greater part of the eighteenth centuries but few names are\r\nto be found, and it is not until the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that those of wounded non-commissioned officers and men can\r\nbe traced. In other appendices are lists of those who won medals for\r\ndistinguished conduct in the field, and also those to whom medals for\r\nlong service and good conduct have been awarded.\r\n\r\nIt has been my object to write this book as far as possible on the\r\nlines of a biography, and by quotations from regimental sources\r\nof information to let the Royal Irish describe their doings in\r\ntheir own words. In the wars of William III. and of Anne this was\r\ncomparatively easy, for though the regiment has preserved no official\r\nrecords for the 17th and 18th centuries, during the first thirty\r\nyears of its existence it produced four military historians, three\r\nof them officers, one a sergeant. Brigadier-General Kane, Captain\r\nRobert Parker, and Sergeant John Millner have left books, and\r\nBrigadier-General Robert Stearne a manuscript journal describing the\r\nevents they witnessed. Unfortunately they all wrote for a public far\r\nmore concerned in the general results of a battle or a siege than in\r\nthe doings of an individual regiment; and though they gave excellent\r\naccounts of an engagement, they failed as a rule to describe the\r\npart played in it by the men under their command. Whether their\r\nlaconic style was due to modesty--for the three officers were all\r\ndistinguished soldiers--or to want of descriptive power, it is\r\nimpossible to say, but the fact remains that they have bequeathed to\r\ntheir successors in the Royal Irish accounts singularly deficient\r\nin regimental detail. In some cases they failed to record the\r\ncasualties among the XVIIIth in a battle or a siege, and when they\r\nremembered to do so, often forgot to give the names of killed or\r\nwounded officers. Their indifference to the losses of the lower ranks\r\nis characteristic of all armies in the 17th and 18th centuries; and\r\nthey tell us nothing of the deaths by disease, or of the drafts of\r\nrecruits by which the waste of war was made good. Sergeant Millner\r\nis equally unenlightening. If, instead of devoting his undoubted\r\ntalents to the production of a sort of Quartermaster-General’s diary\r\nof Marlborough’s movements, he had written an account of the life of\r\nthe regiment on active service, he would have left behind him a very\r\ninteresting book, instead of a comparatively dull one.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the XVIIIth in the campaign of 1745 in the Low\r\nCountries were described in the journal of one of the officers,\r\nwhose name has not been preserved. For a hundred years the regiment\r\nproduced no more authors, until, after the end of the first Chinese\r\nwar, Lieutenant A. Murray wrote an interesting account of the Royal\r\nIrish in that campaign.\r\n\r\nFor the wars in the beginning and middle of Queen Victoria’s reign\r\nmuch valuable material was obtained from private sources by the\r\nhonorary secretary of the Historical Committee, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nA. R. Savile, who for many years devoted himself to the collection\r\nof information from officers who had served with the regiment in\r\nthese campaigns. Probably no one but the man who has profited by\r\nColonel Savile’s exertions can appreciate adequately the energy and\r\nperseverance he displayed in this labour of love for his regiment.\r\nHe has also prepared two appendices; one giving an epitome of the\r\nservices of the Colonels of the regiment, the other describing the\r\nmemorials which have been raised by the officers and men of the\r\nRoyal Irish to the memory of those of their comrades who died on\r\nactive service. Nor is this all for which I have to thank him: his\r\ncollection of historical matter relating to the regiment at all\r\nperiods of its existence has proved of great help to me:--indeed in\r\nall honesty I may say that if this book meets with success a great\r\npart of that success will be due to the “spade work,” the results of\r\nwhich Colonel Savile has generously placed at my disposal.\r\n\r\nMany of the past and present officers of the Royal Irish regiment\r\nhave given me great assistance in the later campaigns by preparing\r\nfor me statements recording their personal recollections, and by\r\nlending me their diaries and letters, written at the seat of war; and\r\nseveral non-commissioned officers have supplied me with interesting\r\ndetails about episodes in South Africa.\r\n\r\nWith the officers who form the Historical Committee I have worked\r\nin perfect harmony and identity of views, and I have to thank them\r\nwarmly for the unfailing support they have given to me during the two\r\nyears which it has taken me to prepare this book.\r\n\r\nI have to express my sense of obligation to the Librarians of the War\r\nOffice, the India Office, the United Service Institution, and the\r\nRoyal Colonial Institute, and the officials at the Record Office for\r\ntheir friendly help.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Rudyard Kipling the warm thanks of the regiment are due for his\r\nkindness in allowing the reproduction of his ballad on the second\r\nbattalion of the Royal Irish in the Black Mountain campaign.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of this record very many books have been\r\nconsulted. Among them stands out pre-eminently the ‘History of the\r\nBritish Army,’ by the Hon. John Fortescue, who, by his masterly\r\ndescriptions of the campaigns he has dealt with up to the present,\r\nhas made the path of a regimental historian comparatively smooth.\r\n\r\n  SHERBORNE, DORSET.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Handwritten letter from Lord Wolseley.)]\r\n[Illustration: (Text of the letter is in the Preface.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                            v\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  1684-1697.\r\n\r\n  THE RAISING OF THE REGIMENT: AND THE WARS OF WILLIAM III.          1\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  1701-1717.\r\n\r\n  MARLBOROUGH’S CAMPAIGNS IN THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION      25\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  1718-1793.\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR--THE SIEGE OF OSTEND--LEXINGTON--\r\n  BUNKER’S HILL                                                     65\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  1793-1817.\r\n\r\n  THE WAR WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC: TOULON--CORSICA--EGYPT.

Charles formed\r\nthese independent troops and companies into regiments of horse and\r\nfoot; and as many of the officers had seen service on the Continent\r\nin foreign armies, and a large number of the rank and file were\r\ndescendants of Cromwell’s veterans, Arthur, Earl of Granard,[1]\r\nwhen granted the commission of colonel in one of the newly raised\r\ninfantry regiments, took command not of a mob of recruits with\r\neverything to learn, but of a body of soldiers of whom any officer\r\nmight be proud. Of the corps thus raised all but one had an ephemeral\r\nexistence. During the struggle between James II. and William III.\r\nfor the possession of Ireland some followed the example of the foot\r\nguards, joined the Stuart king in a body, and then took service in\r\nFrance, while others broke up, officers and men ranging themselves\r\nas individuals on the side of the monarch with whose religious or\r\npolitical views they were in sympathy. The one bright exception was\r\nthe regiment formed by Lord Granard, which under the successive\r\nnames of Forbes’, Meath’s, Hamilton’s, the Royal regiment of Foot\r\nof Ireland, the XVIIIth, and the Royal Irish regiment, has earned\r\nundying laurels in every part of the world.\r\n\r\nThough brought over to England to help in the suppression of\r\nMonmouth’s rebellion against James II., Granard’s took no part in the\r\noperations by which the rising was crushed at Sedgemoor, and in the\r\nautumn of 1685 returned to Ireland,[2] where evil days awaited it.\r\nWith James’s attempt against the liberties of his English subjects\r\nit is not the province of a regimental historian to deal; but it\r\nis necessary to explain that the King, desiring ardently to own an\r\narmy upon which he could count to obey him blindly in the political\r\ncampaign he was planning, proposed to drive from the Colours all\r\nofficers and men upon whom he could not rely implicitly to carry out\r\nhis schemes. He decided to begin operations in Ireland, where he gave\r\nthe Earl of Tyrconnel unlimited power to remodel the _personnel_\r\nof the troops. In 1686, Tyrconnel summarily dismissed from many\r\nregiments all the Protestants in the ranks, whom he stripped of\r\ntheir uniforms and turned penniless and starving upon the world.\r\nThe officers fared little better: two of Granard’s captains, John\r\nSt Leger and Frederick Hamilton, were “disbanded” solely on account\r\nof their religious beliefs. As a protest against these proceedings\r\nLord Granard resigned his commission, to which his son Arthur, Lord\r\nForbes, was appointed on March 1, 1686. Next year the regiment\r\n“underwent a further purge,” thus described by Brigadier-General\r\nStearne,[3] who was then one of Forbes’s officers. “Tyrconnel made\r\na strict review of each troop and company, wherein he found a great\r\nmany descendants of the ‘Cromelians,’ as he termed them, who must\r\nturn out also, and took the name of every man who was to be of the\r\nnext disbandment, so that every soldier of an English name was marked\r\ndown. As soon as the camp broke up and the army returned into winter\r\nquarters, most of the officers as well as soldiers were disbanded,\r\nand only a few kept in for a while to discipline those that supplied\r\ntheir places.” Tyrconnel rid himself of about four thousand of all\r\nranks, or considerably more than half the Irish army; the men he\r\nreplaced with peasants, good in physique but without discipline or\r\ntraining, while the officers he appointed were of a very inferior\r\nclass, who in the war of 1690-91 failed in many cases to turn to good\r\naccount the splendid fighting qualities of their soldiers. It is,\r\nhowever, only fair to Tyrconnel’s memory to mention that while he\r\nthus reduced the efficiency of the Irish army, he increased its power\r\nof expansion by devising a short service and reserve system by which\r\nmany thousand men could be recalled to the Colours in case of need.\r\n\r\nThanks to the political influence and strong personality of Forbes,\r\na “bold and daring man,” who had learned the trade of war first in\r\nthe army of France under the great Turenne, and later in a campaign\r\nagainst the Turks in Hungary, the regiment in the general ruin\r\nsuffered less than any other corps. In defiance of Tyrconnel, Forbes\r\nsucceeded in retaining more of his old officers and soldiers than\r\nany other colonel, and in 1688, when the regiment, 770 strong, was\r\nordered to England to meet the invasion threatened by the Prince of\r\nOrange, it still contained a number of good officers, sergeants, and\r\nold soldiers, whose united efforts had welded into shape the mass\r\nof recruits recently poured into its ranks. For the next few months\r\nthe strain upon these veterans must have been great, as they had to\r\nkeep the young soldiers in order in a country where Irish troops\r\nat that time were looked upon with deep suspicion and hostility by\r\nthe people, and not as now heartily welcomed by all classes. After\r\nbeing stationed for some time in London the regiment marched to\r\nSalisbury, where James had concentrated his troops to meet the Prince\r\nof Orange; and when the King, deserted by his generals, statesmen,\r\nand courtiers, abandoned his army and fled to France, Forbes kept\r\nhis men together and returned to the neighbourhood of London, where\r\nhe was quartered at the village of Colnbrook, near Hounslow. From\r\nthe Prince of Orange, who by this time was actually, though not yet\r\nlegally, King of England, Forbes received orders to disband the Roman\r\nCatholics of his regiment, and after five hundred officers and men\r\nhad been disarmed and sent to Portsmouth _en route_ for the Isle of\r\nWight, several officers, many sergeants, corporals, and drummers,\r\nand about a hundred and thirty private soldiers, remained with the\r\nColours.\r\n\r\nSoon after this turning of the tables the regiment had an experience,\r\nprobably unique in military history--an examination in theology,\r\nin which all ranks passed with high honours. The adventure is thus\r\ndescribed in Stearne’s journal:--\r\n\r\n  “A report spread through the whole kingdom that the Irish were\r\n  murdering, burning and destroying the whole country, insomuch\r\n  that there was not one town in the whole nation that had not an\r\n  account they were committing all these cruelties in the very next\r\n  town or village to them. Sir John Edgworth, who was our major,\r\n  commanded the regiment at this time (Lord Forbes being with the\r\n  Prince of Orange in London); he was quartered at Lord Oslington’s\r\n  house near Colnbrook, and upon the first of this flying report,\r\n  sent for all the regiment to repair immediately to his quarters\r\n  where there was a large walled court before the door, in which he\r\n  drew them up with the design to keep them there until this rumour\r\n  was over, but the country people, hearing that an Irish regiment\r\n  was there, came flocking from all parts to knock us on the head:\r\n  but Sir John bid them at their peril, not to approach, and told\r\n  them we were not Irish Papists but true Church of England men;\r\n  and seeing among the crowd a gentleman, called to him and desired\r\n  he would send to the minister of the parish to read prayers\r\n  to us, and if the minister did not convince them we were all\r\n  of the Church of England, we would submit to their mercy. The\r\n  minister was soon sent for, and to prayers we went, repeating the\r\n  responses of the Liturgy so well and so exactly that the minister\r\n  declared to the mob he never before heard the responses of the\r\n  Church of England prayers repeated so distinctly and with so much\r\n  devotion, upon which the mob gave a huzza, and cried ‘Long live\r\n  the Prince of Orange,’ and so returned home.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1689, the regiment was re-equipped,[4] and in\r\nanticipation of the recruits who in a few months began to refill its\r\ndepleted ranks, weapons were issued for its full establishment. Five\r\nhundred and seventy-nine men were to be armed with flint-lock muskets\r\nand bayonets, while two hundred and forty were still to carry long\r\npikes for the protection of the musketeers against cavalry on the\r\nbattlefield and on the march. The pike, however, was a dying weapon,\r\nand was soon superseded completely by the bayonet. No mention is made\r\nof hand-grenades, though these missiles were already carried by the\r\ngrenadier company, composed of men chosen from their comrades in the\r\nregiment for height, strength, and courage.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1688-89 Lord Forbes resigned his commission, on\r\nthe ground that having sworn allegiance to James II. he could bear\r\narms for no other king during his old master’s lifetime.[5] For a few\r\nweeks Major Sir John Edgworth replaced him, but owing to financial\r\nscandals compromising to himself and several of his subordinates he\r\nwas obliged to retire,[6] and Edward, Earl of Meath, was appointed\r\nto the vacancy on May 1, 1689, when William III. completed his\r\narrangements for re-officering the regiment, which was numbered the\r\nEighteenth of the infantry of the line. He issued forty-one new\r\ncommissions, some to the seniors who had escaped disbandment at\r\nTyrconnel’s hands, others to officers who had been expelled from the\r\narmy during James’s reign, others again to young men with no previous\r\nmilitary experience. The names of the officers are given in the\r\nfootnote.[7]\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the revolution by which James II. was deposed\r\nand William and Mary placed upon the throne was to plunge England\r\ninto the vortex of Continental politics. As Prince of Orange, William\r\nhad been the moving spirit in the coalition of States formed to curb\r\nthe ambition of the French king, Louis XIV., who throughout his life\r\nstrove to aggrandise himself at the expense of his neighbours; and\r\nwhen James II. took refuge in France, Louis saw his opportunity to\r\nstrike a heavy blow at William. By long and careful attention to his\r\nnavy he had made it superior to the combined fleets of the English\r\nand the Dutch--the great naval powers of the time--and, thanks to\r\nhis command of the sea, was able to land James at Kinsale with five\r\nthousand excellent French soldiers to give backbone to the forty\r\nthousand men collected by Tyrconnel in anticipation of his Royal\r\nmaster’s arrival. So slow was communication in those days that,\r\nthough James disembarked at Kinsale in March 1689, the news of the\r\ninvasion did not reach England for several weeks, when William had\r\nalready despatched most of his best troops to swell the forces of\r\nthe Allies facing the French in the Low Countries. William hurriedly\r\nraised more regiments, but it was not until August that Marshal\r\nSchomberg, the veteran selected for the command of the expedition,\r\nlanded near Belfast, where in a few days he was joined by Meath’s[8]\r\nregiment, which for some months had been quartered in Wales. The\r\narmy was sent to Ireland utterly unprepared to take the field. There\r\nwas no transport, the commissariat was wretched, the artillery was\r\nshort of horses; guns, muskets, and powder, food, clothing, and shoes\r\nalike were bad. No wonder, therefore, that after taking the town of\r\nCarrickfergus, Schomberg refused to give battle to James, and fell\r\nback upon an entrenched camp at Dundalk to await reinforcements\r\nof every kind. Before the autumnal rains set in the General\r\nordered his troops to build themselves huts, and the foreigners in\r\nWilliam’s pay--old warriors, who had bought their experience in many\r\ncampaigns--worked with a will; but the English regiments, composed\r\nof lazy, careless, and ignorant recruits, whose officers were no\r\nbetter soldiers than their men, would not take the trouble to run up\r\nshelters or dig trenches to drain their camping-grounds. Fever soon\r\nbroke out with appalling results. Out of the 14,000 troops assembled\r\nat Dundalk, 1700 died on the spot, 800 perished on the waggons in\r\nwhich the sick were carried to the coast, 3800 died in the hospitals\r\nof Belfast. The losses in the XVIIIth regiment are not known, but\r\nfrom Schomberg’s confidential report on the troops under his command\r\nit seems to have suffered less than other corps. Writing on October\r\n23, 1689, the Marshal says: “Meath’s (18th Foot), best regiment\r\nof all the army, both as regards clothing and good order, and the\r\nofficers generally good. The soldiers being all of this province, the\r\ncampaign is not so hard on them as on others.”\r\n\r\nEarly in November James gave up the attempt to entice Schomberg out\r\nof his entrenchments and went into winter quarters. The Marshal\r\npromptly followed his example, holding the country between Lough\r\nErne and Belfast with a chain of fortified posts, and establishing\r\nhis headquarters at Lisburn, where the XVIIIth was placed in charge\r\nof his personal safety. The staff of the regiment must have been\r\nhard-worked in the spring of 1690, for recruits streamed in so fast\r\nthat in June it was nearly the strongest corps in the British army,\r\nstanding on parade six hundred and seventy-eight officers and men.\r\nFor several months there was constant skirmishing along the line\r\nof outposts; but no movements of importance took place until June,\r\nwhen William III. arrived at Carrickfergus with two hundred and\r\neighty-four transports and many vessels laden with stores. Though\r\nthis great mass of shipping was escorted by a ludicrously small\r\nsquadron of only six men-of-war, it was not attacked on the voyage,\r\nfor the French had neglected to send a fleet to cruise in the Irish\r\nseas, thus leaving the line of communication across St George’s\r\nChannel uninterrupted. When the reinforcements brought by the King\r\nhad landed, the army in Ireland reached the respectable total of\r\nabout 37,000 men, of whom 21,000 were British, and the remainder\r\nHuguenots, Dutch, and Danes--continental mercenaries whom William had\r\nimported to lend solidity to his recently raised English regiments.\r\n\r\nThe French officers in James’s army had repeatedly urged him to\r\nretire into Connaught and defend the line of the Shannon, but on\r\npolitical grounds he declined to accept this excellent advice, and\r\nafter some manœuvring took up a position on the river Boyne, near\r\nOldbridge and Duleek. Here he entrenched himself, but on the 1st of\r\nJuly William attacked and routed him with considerable loss. As the\r\nXVIIIth regiment played no important part in the engagement, if,\r\nindeed, it came under fire at all, it is only necessary to say that\r\nthough some of James’s troops fought with distinguished gallantry in\r\nthis battle, others did not show the fine qualities they exhibited\r\nlater at Limerick and Aughrim. Covered by a rear-guard of Frenchmen,\r\nthe defeated army fell back upon the Shannon. James, for the second\r\ntime, deserted his soldiers and fled to France, while William\r\noccupied Dublin, and matured his plans for the next phase of the\r\ncampaign. By a great victory over the Anglo-Dutch fleet at Beachy\r\nHead the King of France won for the moment the absolute command of\r\nthe British Channel, and thus could throw reinforcements at will\r\ninto the south and west of Ireland by the ports of Waterford, Cork,\r\nKinsale, Limerick, and Galway. These towns were, therefore, essential\r\nto William; and hardly less important was Athlone, the entrance to\r\nthe wild districts of Connaught, to which he hoped to confine the\r\nfuture operations of the war. A strong detachment under General\r\nDouglas was therefore sent against Athlone, while William himself led\r\nthe greater part of his army towards Limerick, where a large number\r\nof James’s troops had been concentrated. Though these regiments had\r\nworked hard to improve the fortifications of the city, its defences\r\nwere still so imperfect that when the French heard that William was\r\napproaching they pronounced the place to be untenable and moved off\r\nto Galway, leaving the Irish, about 20,000 strong, to defend it,\r\nunder the command of General Boisleau, an officer who had learned to\r\nappreciate the good qualities of his allies, and Sarsfield, an Irish\r\nsoldier of great brilliancy and courage. Reinforced by Douglas, whose\r\ndetachment had failed to make any impression on Athlone, William\r\nappeared before Limerick on August 9, and after brushing away the\r\nenemy’s skirmishers pitched camp within a quarter of a mile of the\r\ncity wall, expecting little resistance from a place so weak that the\r\nFrench had declared it “could be taken by throwing apples at it.” In\r\neight days William opened his batteries, though with very inferior\r\nordnance, for by a daring raid Sarsfield had swooped on the convoy\r\nbringing up his siege-train and destroyed nearly all his heavy guns.\r\nOn the 20th the grenadiers of the XVIIIth and Cutts’s regiments\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves by the capture of a strong redoubt\r\nnear John’s Gate. A sudden rush from the trenches brought them to the\r\nfoot of the work, into which they hurled a shower of hand-grenades,\r\nand then scrambling over the parapet under heavy fire, dislodged\r\nthe defenders with the bayonet. As it was known that the redoubt\r\nhad an open gorge, a quantity of fascines had been collected in the\r\ntrenches, with which the grenadiers filled up the gap, and then held\r\nthe redoubt against a determined sally until they were relieved by\r\nother troops. The affair cost the victors two hundred and seventy-one\r\nkilled and wounded; but though it is known that the grenadiers\r\nsuffered heavily, the only casualty recorded in the XVIIIth is the\r\ndeath of Captain Needham, who was killed by a random shot at the end\r\nof the engagement.\r\n\r\nThis success was followed by the capture of another outlying work;\r\nthe trenches were pushed close to the walls, and six batteries played\r\nupon the defences, which, near John’s Gate, began to crumble under\r\nthe bombardment. This breach William determined to assault, though\r\nhe was warned by some of his officers that Limerick was not yet\r\nsufficiently shaken to be stormed. According to many historians,\r\nhis reasons for hurrying on the attack were that his supply of\r\nammunition was running low, and that with the example of Dundalk\r\nbefore him, he could not venture to expose his troops to the terrible\r\nrains which had set in. “At times the downpour was such that the men\r\ncould not work the guns, and to mount fresh batteries soon became\r\nan impossibility: the trenches were knee-deep in mud: the soldiers\r\nwere never dry from morning till night and from night till morning:\r\nsickness, which had been prevalent in the camp before, increased to a\r\nplague: the tenting ground became a mere swamp, and those who could\r\nafford it kept down the overwhelming damp only by burning bowls of\r\nspirits under the canvas.”[9] On the 27th the breach appeared to be\r\npracticable, and William ordered Douglas to deliver the assault.\r\nHalf the grenadiers of each regiment, five hundred men in all, were\r\nto lead, supported by the XVIIIth and five other infantry corps:\r\non the left of the main attack was another column of infantry: and\r\ndrawn up in rear stood a strong force of cavalry. At half-past three\r\nin the afternoon the grenadiers dashed out of the trenches, hurled\r\nthemselves against the palisade of the counterscarp, and carried it\r\nafter fierce fighting; then, gaining the covered way, they dropped\r\ninto the ditch, scrambled up the breach, and pursued its defenders\r\nheadlong into the town. So far all had gone well: the impetuous\r\nvalour of the grenadiers had carried all before it, and victory was\r\nwithin William’s grasp, when a mistaken interpretation of orders\r\nruined the day’s work. The supporting infantry should have followed\r\nthe grenadiers up the breach, but, allowing themselves to be drawn\r\ninto pursuit of some of the enemy along the covered way, they left\r\nthe grenadiers without reinforcements. When the defenders saw that\r\nno more troops were pressing up the breach, they rallied, and,\r\nexcited by witnessing the destruction of one of William’s foreign\r\nbattalions by an accidental explosion, they drove the remnants of the\r\ngrenadiers back into the covered way. If the failure to carry the\r\nbreach was to be redeemed even partially, it was essential that the\r\ncovered way should remain in the attackers’ hands, and round this\r\npart of the fortifications raged a fierce fight, in which both sides\r\nshowed splendid courage; but, after three hours’ indecisive combat,\r\nDouglas found that his men had used nearly all their ammunition,\r\nand drew off to camp with a loss of at least five hundred dead\r\nand a thousand wounded. In this unsuccessful assault the XVIIIth\r\nsuffered severely;[10] more than a hundred sergeants, corporals, and\r\n“sentinels” (as private soldiers were then termed) were killed or\r\nwounded, and, though the officers of the regiment who left accounts\r\nof this war are not agreed as to the exact casualties among the\r\ncommissioned ranks, it appears certain that six were killed and\r\neight wounded.[11] Though all their names have not been recorded,\r\nit is known that Captain Charles Brabazon, Lieutenant P. Latham,\r\nand Ensign ---- Smith were killed; Lieutenant-Colonel G. Newcomb\r\n(or Newcomen) died of his wounds, and Colonel the Earl of Meath,\r\nLieutenants R. Blakeney and C. Hubblethorne, were wounded.\r\n\r\nDispirited by his reverse, William raised the siege, ordered his army\r\ninto winter quarters, and after handing over the command to Ginkell,\r\na Dutch general, returned to England after a campaign in which he\r\nhad scored only one marked success--the victory at the Boyne. He had\r\nfailed to capture Athlone and Limerick, and, with the exception of\r\nWaterford, all the ports in the south and west were still open to the\r\nFrench navy. In September, however, the arrival of Marlborough with\r\nan expedition from England improved the situation: Cork and Kinsale\r\nsurrendered, and thus the harbours of Limerick and Galway alone\r\nremained available for the enemy’s operations. Ginkell’s first step\r\nwas to establish himself on a line which, starting at Ballyshannon\r\nin the north-west, ran through Enniskillen, Longford, Mullingar,\r\nCashel, and Fermoy to Castletown-Berehaven in the south-west. The\r\nregiment was ordered to Mullingar, where it passed the winter--very\r\nunpleasantly, according to Stearne, who states that, “in the month of\r\nDecember our garrison being reinforced by several regiments of Horse\r\nand Foot, marched towards the enemy’s frontier, where after having\r\nfatigued the troops for upwards of three months in this bad season\r\nof the year in ravaging and burning the country we returned to our\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\nGinkell opened the campaign of 1691 by an attack on Athlone, a town\r\nbuilt on both sides of the Shannon, and enclosed by walls, not in\r\ngood condition but still by no means to be despised. On the right or\r\nConnaught bank a grim old castle frowned down upon a stone bridge,\r\nthe only permanent means of communication across the river, for\r\nthough there was a ford it was practicable only in very dry weather.\r\nAfter a short cannonade, Ginkell breached and stormed the defences\r\non the Leinster side of the river, and, driving the enemy before\r\nhim across the bridge, made himself master of the eastern half of\r\nAthlone. But now his real difficulties began. Batteries bristled on\r\nthe bank above the ford; the guns of the castle commanded the bridge,\r\nwhich was so narrow that a few men could hold it against a regiment;\r\nand General St Ruth, a French officer of great experience, from his\r\ncamp hard by could reinforce the garrison without hindrance from the\r\nbesiegers. Ginkell rapidly threw up batteries, and opened so vigorous\r\na fire with fifty guns and mortars that one side of the castle\r\ncrumbled away and the houses on the Connaught bank were knocked to\r\npieces. But until he had crossed the river he could not close with\r\nhis enemy; his pontoons were far behind him, and he had no transport\r\nto bring them to the front; and the defence of the bridge was so\r\nstubborn that he gained ground there only a few inches at a time.\r\nSt Ruth scoffed at the idea of the place being in serious danger,\r\ndecrying Ginkell as an old soldier who ought to know better than to\r\nwaste time and men on a hopeless enterprise. “His master,” he said,\r\n“ought to hang him for trying to take Athlone, as my master ought to\r\nhang me if I lose it.” But the Dutch general determined to ascertain\r\nif the river was fordable, and, in the words of Stearne, instead of\r\ncalling for volunteers,\r\n\r\n  “promised three Danish soldiers who lay under sentence of death,\r\n  their lives and a reward if they would attempt fording the river,\r\n  which they gladly accepted, and at noonday put on armour, and\r\n  entered the river a little below the bridge, and went at some\r\n  distance from each other; the enemy took them for deserters, and\r\n  we from our trenches fired seemingly at them, but over their\r\n  heads at the enemy; when they had passed the depth of the water,\r\n  and almost on the other side, they turned back, which when the\r\n  enemy perceived they fired at them as hard as they could, but our\r\n  cannon which was reserved for that purpose, as also our small\r\n  shot, fired so briskly upon them that they could not hold up\r\n  their heads to take aim at the men, by which they were saved,\r\n  two being only slightly wounded. The General finding the river\r\n  fordable (which it had not been for many years) resolved to try\r\n  and pass it, upon which he gave orders for 40 Grenadiers from\r\n  each company and 80 choice men out of each Battalion of the whole\r\n  army to march as privately as possible into the trenches, and the\r\n  whole army to be under arms to sustain the attack should there be\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n  “On the 20th June[12] the detachments marched into the trenches\r\n  (I being one of the Captains who commanded ours) with all the\r\n  privacy we could, but notwithstanding all our caution, St Ruth\r\n  had notice of our motion and design by the appearance of crowds\r\n  of people on the hills to see the action, upon which he marched\r\n  down his whole army to the bank of his part of the town, and\r\n  filled the Castle and trenches with as many men as it could\r\n  well hold; our General perceiving this, put off the attack till\r\n  another time, ordering our detachments back to Camp, but at the\r\n  same time gave private orders that not a man should stir from his\r\n  Regiment, or be put on any other duty, but to be all ready at a\r\n  minute’s warning. St Ruth seeing us draw off, was persuaded that\r\n  our General dare not pass the River at this time, and in this\r\n  security marched his Army back to Camp, leaving only a slight\r\n  body of men to guard their works and the Castle. The next day\r\n  a soldier of our Army (whether sent by the General, or he went\r\n  of himself, I can’t say) went over to the enemy and was carry’d\r\n  before St Ruth, and told him that the common report in our Camp\r\n  was that the General finding it was not practicable to pass the\r\n  River at this time resolved to try what he could do at Banagher\r\n  which lay ten miles down the River, and that everything was\r\n  getting ready for the march. St Ruth, easily persuaded with\r\n  this notion, and finding all things very quiet in our Camp, made\r\n  a splendid entertainment for all the Ladies and Gentlemen, the\r\n  Officers of the Town, and the Camp. The same day, being 22nd\r\n  June, our General sent private orders along the Line for all\r\n  the detachments to march directly into the trenches, and to\r\n  keep under all the cover they could, at the same time he posted\r\n  several sentries on the hills to prevent anybody appearing to the\r\n  enemy. About 3 o’clock, when St Ruth was at the height of his\r\n  merryment, we began the attack by jumping into the River, and\r\n  whilst we were wading over, our Cannon and small shot played with\r\n  great fury over our heads on the enemy, insomuch that they did us\r\n  but little hurt in passing, and when we got over they made but\r\n  little or no resistance but fled immediately.\r\n\r\n  “At the same time we jumped into the River, part of our\r\n  detachments attacked the Bridge, and laid planks over the arch\r\n  that had been broken down upon our taking the first town, so\r\n  that before St Ruth had any account of our design we were in\r\n  possession of the town; however he marched his army down to try\r\n  if he could force us back again, but he committed a grand error\r\n  which he found out too late, and that was leaving the works at\r\n  the back of the town stand, which became a fortification against\r\n  himself, for had it not been for this, we should never have been\r\n  able to maintain the town against his army, as we were not in\r\n  possession of the Castle. When St Ruth found there was no forcing\r\n  us back without a formal siege he returned to his camp, and those\r\n  in the Castle seeing him march off immediately surrendered at\r\n  discretion, and next day very early St Ruth decamped and marched\r\n  off with great precipitation. In this action we had only 27 men\r\n  killed, and about as many wounded, and not one Officer of note\r\n  hurt.”\r\n\r\nGinkell now proposed to take the town of Galway and then turn\r\nsouthwards against Limerick, but before this plan could be put into\r\nexecution it was necessary to dislodge St Ruth from the strong\r\ndefensive position he had taken up near Ballinasloe, where he was\r\ndetermined to fight a pitched battle in the hope of retrieving the\r\nreputation he had lost on the banks of the Shannon. His left rested\r\non the castle of Aughrim, a few miles south of Ballinasloe; his right\r\nwas marked by the village of Urachree; his centre ran along the\r\nslopes of a green and fertile hill, well suited for counter-attacks\r\nby horse and foot. Much of the ground he occupied was surrounded\r\nby bogs, crossed by a few tracks, of which only two were fit for\r\ncavalry, while all were under the fire of his guns. Between the foot\r\nof the hill and the bogs were many little patches of cultivation\r\nenclosed by hedges and ditches, some of which St Ruth levelled to\r\nallow his cavalry free movement, while he left others intact in order\r\nto give cover to his marksmen, to break the enemy’s formations, and\r\nto conceal the movement of his troops upon the field of battle. The\r\ninfantry held the centre; the cavalry were on the flanks with a\r\nstrong reserve in rear of the left under Sarsfield, who had specific\r\ninstructions not to move without a distinct order from St Ruth\r\nhimself. On July 11, the armies, each about 20,000 strong, were\r\nwithin touch, but owing to a heavy fog it was not until the afternoon\r\nof the 12th that the battle began with a sharp skirmish, which\r\nrevealed to Ginkell the strength of St Ruth’s position, and convinced\r\nhim that his only hope of success lay in turning the enemy’s left.\r\nHe accordingly made a feigned attack upon the Frenchman’s right,\r\nlaunched the remainder of his infantry against the centre and left,\r\nand sent his cavalry to force their way past the Castle of Aughrim.\r\nThe troops directed against the centre were to halt when they had\r\ncrossed the bog, and on no account to push on until the column on\r\ntheir right was safely over the quagmire and the cavalry had turned\r\nthe enemy at Aughrim. But when the soldiers, after floundering\r\nthigh-deep in mud and slime, reached firm ground they got out of\r\nhand, and forgetting their orders rushed forward, carrying everything\r\nbefore them until a sudden charge of cavalry swept them backwards\r\nin confusion, while the column for which they should have waited\r\nwas still struggling in the bog. When this supporting column, of\r\nwhich the XVIIIth regiment formed part, had scrambled through the\r\nquagmire and re-formed its ranks, it moved towards the hill over\r\na part of the field apparently deserted by the enemy, but really\r\nfilled with sharpshooters, who, hidden in hedges and ditches, with\r\nadmirable coolness held their fire until the leading companies were\r\nwithin twenty yards of them. Then a storm of bullets smote the head\r\nof the column; men dropped in scores, and for a moment the advance\r\nwas checked, but the troops quickly rallied, and hurling themselves\r\nagainst the first hedge carried it against a resolute defence.\r\nHedge after hedge, ditch after ditch, were charged and won, but by\r\nthe time the last obstacle was surmounted the infantry had fallen\r\ninto great confusion: the regiments “were so intermingled together\r\nthat the officers were at a loss what to do,” and at that moment St\r\nRuth’s cavalry came thundering down upon them. Under this charge the\r\ndisorganised infantry gave way, and were being driven backwards into\r\nthe bog, when St Ruth’s horsemen were themselves assailed in rear by\r\nsome of Ginkell’s cavalry, who, after a daring march and still more\r\ndaring passage of a stream under the walls of Aughrim Castle, reached\r\nthe battlefield in time to save the foot soldiers from annihilation.\r\nDuring this cavalry combat occurred an interesting instance of the\r\nvalue of steady barrack-square drill. Throughout the winter of\r\n1690-91 the infantry had been practised in regaining its formation\r\nrapidly after a charge, and now, when relieved from the pressure of\r\nthe enemy, the battalions re-formed with comparative ease, and then\r\nattacked along the whole line. At this moment victory trembled in\r\nthe balance, for though the losses on both sides had been heavy,\r\nthe defenders, on the whole, had had the best of the day, and in\r\nSarsfield’s strong body of cavalry they possessed a reserve which had\r\nnot yet been called into action. Had Sarsfield then struck into the\r\nbattle his troopers might have turned the scale, but he was fettered\r\nby his instructions not to move except on St Ruth’s own order, and St\r\nRuth, struck down by a stray cannon-ball, was lying a headless corpse\r\nupon the ground. The absence of the French general’s directing hand\r\nwas soon felt, though his death was concealed as long as possible;\r\nand when the attacking infantry began to gain ground steadily, and\r\nthe cavalry turning movement was fully developed, the men who for\r\nhours had so valiantly defended their position lost heart and began\r\nto fall back in disorder. Then their discipline failed them, and they\r\nbroke, rushing in panic towards Limerick and Galway, with Ginkell’s\r\ncavalry and dragoons spurring fiercely after them.\r\n\r\nThe losses in this battle were very heavy. In William’s army 73\r\nofficers were killed and 109 wounded; of the other ranks 600 were\r\nkilled and 908 wounded. The XVIIIth escaped lightly: only one\r\nofficer, Captain ---- Butler was killed; a major, a captain, and two\r\nsubalterns were wounded; among the non-commissioned officers and\r\nmen seven were killed and eight wounded.[13] On the subject of the\r\ncasualties in the army commanded by St Ruth historians differ widely;\r\nbut 7000 appears to be the number fixed upon by those least given to\r\nexaggeration. Whatever the actual figures were, however, there can\r\nbe no doubt that James’s soldiers were so completely routed that in\r\ntheir retreat they strewed the roads with their discarded weapons.\r\nA reward of sixpence was offered for every musket brought into\r\nGinkell’s camp; in a short time so many waggon-loads were collected\r\nthat the price was reduced to twopence, and great numbers of firearms\r\nstill came in.[14] The dispersal of St Ruth’s army was the death-blow\r\nto the Stuart cause: Galway made little resistance, and though the\r\ngarrison of Limerick fought stoutly for a month it was obliged to\r\nsurrender on October 3, 1691. The French officers were allowed to\r\nreturn to their own country, accompanied by those of James’s soldiers\r\nwho wished to enter the French army, and with their departure ceased\r\nall organised opposition in Ireland to the rule of William III., who\r\nwas thus free to transfer his troops to the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nThe regiment, however, did not go abroad at once. After wintering\r\nat Waterford it was ordered in the spring of 1692 to Portsmouth, to\r\nreinforce the garrison of England against an invasion threatened\r\nby Louis XIV., and after the French fleet had been beaten at the\r\nbattle of Cape La Hogue the XVIIIth was one of the regiments\r\nselected for a raid against the seaport towns of France; but the\r\ncoast proved so well guarded that it was impossible to land, and the\r\ntransports sailed to the Downs and thence to Ostend, where the troops\r\ndisembarked and marched towards the towns of Furnes and Dixmude,\r\nwhich the French evacuated without waiting to be attacked. While\r\nemployed in strengthening the walls of Dixmude the XVIIIth had a\r\ncurious experience: there was an earthquake, so violent that the\r\nsoldiers thought the French were blowing up the place with hidden\r\nmines, while the Flemish peasants, who were working as navvies,\r\nbecame paralysed with terror and declared that the end of the world\r\nwas come. In a few weeks the greater part of the troops re-embarked\r\nfor England, but not all reached land in safety, for a great storm\r\nscattered the transports, several of which went to the bottom. The\r\nXVIIIth regiment, however, was fortunate enough to escape all loss.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter Lord Meath retired,[15] and was succeeded\r\nin the colonelcy by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Hamilton; Major\r\nOrmsby became Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain Richard Stearne was\r\npromoted to the Majority. In 1693, the regiment, which now was known\r\nas Frederick Hamilton’s, was turned for a few months into a sea-going\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\n  “In May, 1693, we marched to Portsmouth, and embarked on board\r\n  the Grand Fleet, commanded by three joynt Admirals (viz., Sir\r\n  Ralph Delaval, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and Admiral Killigrew) when\r\n  we served this summer as Marines. Our rendezvous was Spithead;\r\n  in June we sailed to Torbay, where we waited for the Fleet which\r\n  was to go under the command of Sir George Rooke who had twenty\r\n  Men of War to convoy them up the Mediterranean. About the latter\r\n  end of June Sir George joyned us, and the whole Fleet set sail\r\n  together, and was looked upon to be the greatest that had been\r\n  in one sea for many years; there being in all with Men of War\r\n  and Merchantmen, English and Dutch, near 800 sail: the Men of\r\n  War with their tenders stretching in one line between the Coast\r\n  of France and the Merchantmen. The Grand Fleet kept Sir George\r\n  company till they passed the Bay of Biscay, being the utmost\r\n  limits of our Admirals’ orders, notwithstanding they very well\r\n  knew that the French Fleet had sailed out of Brest, and was lying\r\n  before them to intercept Sir George. Yet their orders were such\r\n  that they dare not sail any farther, but then parted and returned\r\n  to Torbay.\r\n\r\n  “The French, who never wanted intelligence from our Courtiers,\r\n  had an exact account to what degree our Grand Fleet had orders\r\n  to convoy Sir George, therefore lay by with their Grand Fleet\r\n  about eighteen hours sail beyond the limit of our Grand Fleet;\r\n  they upon first sight believed that our Grand Fleet had still\r\n  kept Sir George company, which put them into such a consternation\r\n  that for some time they stood away, which gave Sir George an\r\n  opportunity of making signals to his Merchant ships to shift for\r\n  themselves and make the best of their way back, whilst he with\r\n  his Men of War sailed after them in very good order. As soon as\r\n  the Enemy discovered their mistake they made all sail they could\r\n  after him, but Sir George, keeping astern of his Merchant ships,\r\n  made a running fight of it, by which means he saved his whole\r\n  fleet except a few heavy sailers which were picked up by their\r\n  Privateers.\r\n\r\n  “After this the French Fleet made the best of their way to\r\n  Brest, and the account coming to our Court, orders were sent to\r\n  the Grand Fleet to sail immediately in quest of them, upon which\r\n  our Admirals sailed immediately to Brest to try if they could get\r\n  there before the enemy, but in vain, for they had got in several\r\n  days before we left Torbay. This affair being over we returned to\r\n  our port, and in September the Land Forces were put on shore. Our\r\n  Regiment was landed part at Chatham and part at Southampton, and\r\n  joyned at Norwich in October. In December we marched to London,\r\n  and were reviewed in Hide Park by the King; two days after we\r\n  embarked at Red House, and sailed for Flanders and landed at\r\n  Ostend in December 1693.”[16]\r\n\r\nThe regiment was now to play a distinguished part in the war with\r\nFrance, which with a breathing space of five short years lasted\r\nuntil 1712. With the exception of the campaign of 1704 in Germany,\r\nthe fighting in which the XVIIIth was concerned took place chiefly\r\nin the country now called Belgium, but then known as Flanders.[17]\r\nIts soil was fertile, and cultivated by a large and industrious\r\npopulation. Its numerous cities were celebrated throughout Europe for\r\nthe wealth of their traders, whose merchandise was carried to the\r\nsea over a network of canals and navigable rivers. Every town was\r\nwalled, and the whole country was studded with fortresses, with many\r\nof which the regiment was to become well acquainted in the course of\r\nthe next twenty years. On the French side of the frontier a chain\r\nof forts stretched from Dunkirk to the Meuse, and Louis had further\r\nstrengthened his border by a great line of field-works, in the hope\r\nof making an invasion of France impossible. In a country so highly\r\nfortified the war necessarily became one of sieges. Each side tried\r\nto breach the other’s line of defences by capturing fortresses. There\r\nwere ceaseless marches and counter-marches, and gigantic attempts to\r\nrelieve the besieged strongholds, met by equally strenuous efforts to\r\nprevent the relieving forces from fulfilling their mission. Flanders,\r\nhowever, was by no means the only part of Europe affected by the\r\nwar, for sooner or later the French armies invaded nearly every\r\ncountry unfortunate enough to be within their reach. To describe the\r\nwhole of Louis’s struggle for supremacy, and to explain the means\r\nby which he induced some of the Allies to abandon the coalition and\r\nrange themselves on his side, would be far outside the scope of a\r\nregimental history. It is enough to say that though the conflict\r\nraged from the shores of the North Sea to the south of Spain, where\r\na few thousand British soldiers served for several years, it was in\r\nFlanders that Marlborough won most of his splendid victories over the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nThe XVIIIth’s first campaign on the Continent--for the few weeks\r\nspent at Dixmude in 1692 cannot be dignified by this name--was\r\nuneventful. There were no great battles, and the only operation of\r\nimportance was the siege of Huy, where the regiment was employed\r\nwith the covering force. In the spring of 1694 the order of\r\nprecedence among the regiments of the British army was settled in\r\na way very displeasing to Hamilton’s officers and men, who ever\r\nsince the camp at Dundalk had claimed for their corps the numerical\r\nposition due to its having been raised in April 1684.[18] Kane\r\nchronicles the decision in a few words.\r\n\r\n  “A Dispute arose about the Rank of our Regiment in particular,\r\n  which were (_sic_) regimented 1 April 1684 from the old\r\n  Independent Companies in Ireland, and had hitherto taken Rank of\r\n  all the Regiments raised by King James the Second, but now those\r\n  Regiments disputed Rank with us: the King referred the Affair to\r\n  a Board of General Officers; and most of them being Colonels of\r\n  those Regiments, would not allow us any other Rank than our first\r\n  coming into England, which was some time before the King landed,\r\n  when he came over Prince of Orange on the Revolution, by which we\r\n  lost Rank of eleven Regiments, taking Rank after those raised by\r\n  King James, and before all those raised by King William. The King\r\n  thought the General Officers had acted with great Partiality, but\r\n  as he had referred the Affair to them, he confirmed it.”\r\n\r\nThe whole question of precedence was re-opened in 1713, and the\r\ncolonel of the XVIIIth made a strong effort to obtain rank for the\r\nregiment from the date of its formation in 1684, but without success.\r\n\r\nWhen William III. took the field in 1695, he commanded an army of\r\n124,000 men, composed of contingents from England, Holland, Denmark,\r\nand many of the German States. The British numbered about 29,000, and\r\nas the King employed them on every occasion when desperate courage\r\nand bull-dog tenacity were needed, it is clear that, however much he\r\ndespised the English politicians who intrigued against him with Louis\r\nXIV., he appreciated his British soldiers at their true worth. As\r\nhis object was the recapture of the fortress of Namur, taken by the\r\nFrench three years before, he began a series of manœuvres designed\r\nto decoy Marshal de Villeroi, the French Commander-in-Chief, so far\r\ninto the western half of the theatre of war that the Allies would\r\nbe able to dash upon Namur and invest it before their intention\r\nwas discovered. William was so far successful that he was able\r\nto surround the fortress on June 23, but not before the French\r\nhad thrown in strong reinforcements under Marshal de Boufflers,\r\nwho took command of the garrison of thirteen or fourteen thousand\r\nexcellent troops. The citadel stands on a rocky height at the end\r\nof the tongue of land formed by the junction of the rivers Sambre\r\nand Meuse. The town is built on the left bank of the Sambre; and in\r\nthe fortification of both citadel and town the highest military art\r\nhad been displayed--first, by the Dutch engineer Cohorn, who planned\r\nand built the works; and later, by his French rival Vauban, who had\r\nextended and improved them so greatly that Namur was now considered\r\nto be impregnable. A hundred and twenty-eight guns and mortars were\r\nmounted on its walls, and its arsenals and storehouses were well\r\nsupplied in every way. On June 28th, William began his trenches, and\r\nfive days later opened fire upon the town, which after desperate\r\nfighting surrendered on July 24, one of the conditions being that the\r\ngarrison should be allowed to retire into the citadel with full power\r\nto take part in its defence.\r\n\r\nDuring this, the first phase of the siege, the XVIIIth was part\r\nof the covering detachment of 20,000 men with which the Prince de\r\nVaudemont, one of William’s trusted lieutenants, protected the\r\noperations of the besiegers so successfully that during several\r\nweeks he engrossed the attention of the French Commander-in-Chief’s\r\nvastly superior force of 90,000 troops. Before quoting Kane’s\r\ninteresting account of the way de Vaudemont “sparred for time,” it\r\nmust be explained that the French were in no hurry to relieve Namur,\r\nwhere they thought de Boufflers could hold his own indefinitely. De\r\nVilleroi accordingly marched against de Vaudemont, who had entrenched\r\nhimself on the river Lys, nine or ten miles south of Ghent; but\r\n\r\n  “finding him stand his Ground, he proceeded with the more\r\n  Caution, and halted about two Leagues short of him, till he\r\n  had sent to Lille for some Battering-Cannon. This took up some\r\n  Time which was what Vaudemont wanted to keep him in Play till\r\n  the King could fix himself before Namur. At length Villeroy\r\n  advanced within less than half a League of us, and finding the\r\n  Prince still keep his Ground, ordered a great many Fascines to\r\n  be cut in order to attack us early next Morning. He also sent\r\n  Lieutenant-General Montal with a strong Body of Horse round by\r\n  our Right, to fall in our Rear, and cut off our Retreat from\r\n  Ghent, which was three Leagues in the Rear of us. Now the Prince\r\n  had three trusty Capuchin Fryars for his Spies, one of whom\r\n  kept constantly about Villeroy’s Quarters, who found Means to\r\n  inform himself of all his Designs; the other two plied constantly\r\n  between both Camps without ever being suspected, who gave\r\n  Vaudemont an Account of everything. Now the Prince having drawn\r\n  Villeroy so near him, thought it high Time to make his Retreat;\r\n  he therefore, as soon as Villeroy appeared, sent off all the\r\n  heavy Baggage and Lumber of the Camp to Ghent, and about Eight\r\n  in the Evening he ordered part of the Cavalry to dismount and\r\n  take the Intrenchments, and the Infantry to march privately off\r\n  with their Pikes and Colours under-hand, lest the Enemy should\r\n  discover us drawing off; and as soon as it grew duskish the\r\n  Cavalry mounted and marched after the Foot. Soon after Villeroy’s\r\n  Advance-Guard finding our Works very quiet, ventured up to them;\r\n  who finding the Birds fled, sent to acquaint the General; on\r\n  which they marched after us as fast as they could. Montal, who by\r\n  this time had got into our Rear, finding us marching off, thought\r\n  to have fallen on our Flank; but Sir David Collier, with two\r\n  Brigades of Foot, gave them so warm a Reception, that they were\r\n  obliged to retire with considerable Loss. Next Morning all our\r\n  Army got safe under the Works of Ghent, at which Time the Enemy’s\r\n  Horse began to appear within a Mile of us; whereupon we past the\r\n  Canal that runs from thence to Bruges, along which a Breast-Work\r\n  had been thrown up.... Vaudemont had now a very difficult Part\r\n  to act in Defence of this Canal against so powerful an Army.\r\n  Villeroy marched immediately down to the Canal, where, for\r\n  upwards of three Weeks, by Marches and Countermarches he harassed\r\n  our small Army off their Legs; however, he could not make the\r\n  least Movement, or form any Design, but the Prince had timely\r\n  Notice of it; which was very surprising if we consider the Canal\r\n  that was between us, so that the French said he dealt with the\r\n  Devil.[19] Villeroy finding he could not pass the Canal on the\r\n  Prince, at length turned towards Dixmude, where the Prince could\r\n  give no manner of Assistance; here he succeeded beyond his most\r\n  sanguine Expectations.”\r\n\r\nAfter an easy victory at Dixmude, which the Governor surrendered\r\nwithout firing a shot, de Villeroi turned towards Brussels, where\r\nthe wealth of the citizens promised much loot to his soldiers; but\r\nhere he was again foiled by de Vaudemont, who out-marched him and\r\ntook up a position which saved the city from capture, though not\r\nfrom a savage and unnecessary bombardment. After his artillery\r\nhad devastated a large part of Brussels, de Villeroi drew off to\r\nawait orders from Paris, thus giving the covering detachment the\r\nopportunity of joining hands with the main army before Namur, where\r\nWilliam was assiduously battering the citadel with a hundred and\r\nthirty-six heavy guns and fifty-eight mortars, whose fire towards\r\nthe end of the siege cost de Boufflers three hundred men a day. On\r\nthe 10th of August, the XVIIIth and three other British regiments\r\nwere transferred to the besieging force, to replace corps shattered\r\nin the earlier operations, and at once began duty in the trenches.\r\nA few days later de Villeroi advanced, hoping to defeat William in\r\na pitched battle, and thus to relieve the garrison which he had so\r\nlong neglected, but he found the King so well posted and the covering\r\narmy so heavily reinforced by the besieging troops that he did not\r\nventure to attack. While the French Commander-in-Chief was beginning\r\nto realise that in leaving de Boufflers so long unrescued he had made\r\nan irreparable mistake, William gave orders for a general assault\r\nupon the citadel, where the works had been breached in several\r\nplaces. During the night of the 19th, six thousand men from the\r\ncovering detachment filed into the trenches, where before daybreak\r\nthey were joined by the greater part of the besiegers. Seven hundred\r\nBritish grenadiers and four regiments--the 17th,[20] the XVIIIth, and\r\nBuchan’s and Mackay’s, two corps which have long since disappeared\r\nfrom the Army List,--under the command of General Lord Cutts, were\r\nto assault the work called the Terra Nova; while the Bavarians,\r\nHessians, Brandenburgers,[21] and Dutch were to make simultaneous\r\nattacks on the other breaches. As the trenches could not hold all\r\nthe troops poured into them, the XVIIIth and Buchan’s were sent to\r\nconceal themselves in the abbey of Salsine, about half a mile from\r\nthe foot of the Terra Nova breach.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. on August 20, the explosion of a barrel of gunpowder gave\r\nthe signal for the attack, and from Cutts’s trenches began to emerge\r\nthe red coats, to whom the most dangerous duty had, as usual, been\r\nentrusted; four sergeants, each followed by fifteen picked men,\r\nled the column; the grenadiers were close behind them; the 17th\r\nand Mackay’s followed in support, with the XVIIIth and Buchan’s in\r\nreserve. It was a desperate enterprise. Between the trenches and the\r\nTerra Nova was a stretch of several hundred yards of ground--smooth,\r\ncoverless, and swept by frontal and cross fire, and before the\r\ngrenadiers had crossed it they had left behind them a long trail of\r\nkilled and wounded. Owing to a mistake in the organisation of the\r\nattack, the grenadiers and the 17th assailed the breach before the\r\nother regiments were at hand to support them, and by the time the\r\nXVIIIth came up the assault had been repulsed with heavy loss; many\r\nof the officers had been hit, and Cutts, the idol of the troops, was\r\nwounded and for the moment incapable of giving orders. Undismayed by\r\nthe confusion and depression around them, the Irishmen with a yell\r\nrushed at the breach. At first they had to scramble over the bodies\r\nof those who fell in the first attempt, but half-way up they reached\r\nthe grenadiers’ high-water mark, and thence struggled upwards over\r\nground covered by no corpses but those of the XVIIIth. From the\r\nneighbouring works they were tormented by cross fire, but yet pushed\r\non, to the admiration of their foes who through the clouds of smoke\r\nwatched them gradually winning their way up the breach, the Colours\r\nhigh in air, despite the carnage among the officers who carried them.\r\nMad with excitement, determined to win at all cost, the regiment by a\r\nsplendid effort reached the top of the breach, where the Colours were\r\nplanted to show the King, who from a hill behind the abbey eagerly\r\nwatched the progress of his British troops, that the Terra Nova was\r\nhis. But as the men surged forward they found themselves faced by\r\na retrenchment undamaged by the bombardment. The officers, holding\r\ntheir lives as nothing for the honour of their country and their\r\ncorps, led rush after rush against this retrenchment, but in vain.\r\nThey could not reach it; guns posted on the flank of the breach mowed\r\ndown whole ranks; infantry fired into them at close range. All that\r\nmen could do the XVIIIth had done, but nothing could withstand such\r\na torrent of lead; the second attack failed, and the remnants of the\r\nregiment were driven backwards down the breach, and then charged by a\r\ncounter-attack of horse and foot which the French let loose upon them.\r\n\r\nShaking themselves clear of the enemy, the survivors fell back\r\ntowards the spot where Cutts, on resuming the command after his wound\r\nwas dressed, had ordered his broken regiments to reassemble. While\r\nthe British were retreating they learned that the Bavarians had not\r\nfared much better than themselves; badly led, they had missed their\r\nproper objective, the breach in a work called the Coehorne, and had\r\nattacked the covered way at a spot where the garrison was in great\r\nforce; and after two hours’ hard fighting they reported that unless\r\nhelp came at once they could not hold their ground. Cutts, who\r\nfrom his love of a “hot fire” had earned for himself the nickname\r\nof the Salamander, instantly determined to go to the rescue of the\r\nBavarians, and halting, turned towards the Coehorne and re-formed\r\nhis column. To the onlookers it seemed impossible that troops fresh\r\nfrom the costly failure at the Terra Nova would face another breach,\r\nbut Cutts knew what British soldiers could do, and his call for\r\nvolunteers for a forlorn hope was answered by two hundred men, who\r\nheaded this fresh attack, followed by Mackay’s, with the XVIIIth\r\nand the other regiments behind them in support. The assault was\r\nsuccessful; the covered way was seized and held by the British,\r\nand all along the line victory smiled upon the Allies, who by five\r\no’clock in the afternoon were lodged solidly within the enemy’s works.\r\n\r\nTo reward the XVIIIth for the magnificent courage it showed at the\r\nTerra Nova the King formally conferred upon it the title of the\r\nRoyal Regiment of Foot of Ireland, with the badge of the Lion of\r\nNassau and the motto “Virtutis Namurcensis Præmium.”[22] In the\r\nyear 1832, the Royal Irish received the somewhat belated official\r\npermission to emblazon this motto on their Colours; and it was not\r\nuntil 1910, two hundred and fifteen years after the capture of\r\nthe fortress, that the regiments who took part in the siege were\r\nallowed to add Namur to their battle honours. In these matters our\r\nGovernment does not move with undue haste; it was only in 1882, that\r\nthe Royal Irish were granted leave to commemorate on their Colours\r\nthe fact that they had shared in the glories of Blenheim, Ramillies,\r\nOudenarde, and Malplaquet, the last of which was won in 1709!\r\n\r\nThe distinctions given by William were dearly earned, for though the\r\nauthorities differ as to the actual numbers of the casualties in the\r\nXVIIIth, all agree that they were enormous. According to the army\r\nchaplain D’Auvergne, who wrote one of the best accounts of William\r\nIII.’s wars in Flanders, the regiment lost twenty-five officers\r\nand two hundred and seventy-one non-commissioned officers and men.\r\nParker and Kane give the same figures, but as both these officers\r\nwere severely wounded it is probable that the returns had been sent\r\nin long before they came back to duty, and that in their books they\r\nadopted D’Auvergne’s numbers without investigation. In Stearne’s\r\nunpublished journal he states that twenty-six officers (whose names\r\nhe does not mention) and three hundred and eighty of the other ranks\r\nwere killed or wounded; and as Stearne was one of the few senior\r\nofficers left with the regiment on the evening of the 20th of August,\r\nhe must have had every opportunity of knowing the exact numbers. Two\r\ntheories have been advanced to explain this discrepancy: the first,\r\nthat Stearne included in his total all who were wounded, while the\r\nother historians took count only of the men who were gravely injured\r\nand admitted into the base hospital at Liege; the other is that among\r\nhis four hundred and six casualties were the officers and men hit in\r\nthe trenches after the XVIIIth joined the besieging army and before\r\nthe day of the assault, or in other words that his figures show the\r\nregiment’s losses during the whole of the siege. But even taken on\r\nthe lower, and therefore safer estimate, the percentage of loss is\r\nastonishingly high. At the beginning of a campaign a regiment was\r\nseldom more than 600 strong; indeed, many historians consider that\r\n500 was the average strength. Since the XVIIIth had taken the field\r\nin June it had done much marching and some work in the trenches,\r\nso that Hamilton’s ranks cannot have been quite full when he gave\r\nthe order to storm the breach; but assuming that Hamilton had with\r\nhim about 600 men, more than 49 per cent, or very nearly half the\r\nregiment, were killed or wounded on August 20, 1695. If the strength\r\nbe taken at 500, the percentage shows that about six men out of\r\nevery ten were hit; while if Stearne’s casualties are adopted the\r\npercentage is 81, more than eight men killed or wounded out of every\r\nten who went into action. As it is impossible to ascertain definitely\r\nthe strength of the XVIIIth, or to pronounce on the accuracy of the\r\nrival chroniclers, it is enough to say that the regiment suffered\r\nmore heavily than any of the other British corps in Cutts’s column,\r\nwhose losses, including those of the grenadiers, amounted at the\r\nleast to thirteen hundred and forty-nine officers and men.[23]\r\n\r\nIn the XVIIIth Lieutenant-Colonel A. Ormsby; Captains B. Purefoy, H.\r\nPinsent, and N. Carteret; Lieutenants C. Fitzmorris and S. Ramme;\r\nEnsigns A. Fettyplace, ---- Blunt, H. Baker, and S. Hayter were\r\nkilled. Captain John Southwell, Ensign B. Lister (or Leycester), and\r\nan officer whose name cannot be traced, died of their wounds. Colonel\r\nFrederick Hamilton; Captains R. Kane, F. Duroure, H. Seymour, and\r\nW. Southwell; Lieutenants L. La Planche, T. Brereton, C. Hybert (or\r\nHibbert), and A. Rolleston; Ensigns T. Gifford, J. Ormsby, and W.\r\nBlakeney were wounded.[24]\r\n\r\nThe result of the assault convinced de Boufflers that he could not\r\nresist a renewed attack, and early on the 22nd he made signals of\r\ndistress to de Villeroi, who finding it impossible to relieve him,\r\nretired to Mons, leaving the garrison of Namur to make the best\r\nterms it could. De Boufflers accordingly ordered his drummers to\r\nbeat the _Chamade_, the recognised signal that a fortress desired\r\nto parley with the enemy, and after two or three days’ negotiations\r\nsurrendered: the troops were to be allowed to return to France, the\r\ncitadel, artillery, and stores remaining in the hands of the victors.\r\nOn the 26th, the French, reduced by the two months’ siege to less\r\nthan five thousand effectives, marched out with all the honours of\r\nwar--drums beating, Colours flying, and arms in their hands--and\r\nafter filing through a double line of the allied troops were escorted\r\nto Givet, the fortress to which they had safe conduct. With the fall\r\nof Namur the campaign of 1695 virtually came to an end, for though\r\nthere was some marching and counter-marching nothing came of these\r\nmanœuvres, and the Allies went into winter quarters early in the\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nThe campaigns of 1696 and 1697 were spent in operations unproductive\r\nof any affairs of importance, and the finances of all the combatants\r\nwere so much exhausted by the strain of this long war that peace\r\nwas signed at Ryswick in September of the latter year. The British\r\ncontingent was sent to Ostend to await ships from England to take\r\nthem home, and on December 10, the XVIIIth sailed on an adventurous\r\nvoyage, thus described by Stearne.\r\n\r\n  “The ship I was in, with one more, having got near the Coast of\r\n  Ireland, there came up with us a Sallee Man of War of about 18\r\n  guns, carrying Zealand colours.[25] When the master of our ship\r\n  saw her bearing down upon us, he called up all the Officers and\r\n  told us what danger we were in of being made slaves for ever. We\r\n  thought it a very hard case after getting over so many dangers\r\n  as we had gone through, upon which we all resolved to die rather\r\n  than be taken, and having got all our men to arms, we made them\r\n  lye close under the gunnel, that they might not discover what\r\n  we were, and called to the other ship, and told them that in\r\n  case she boarded us, that then they should lay her on board the\r\n  other side, and that we would do the like in case they boarded\r\n  them; and our Seamen were to be all ready with ropes to lash us\r\n  together as soon as they laid us on board. At the same time we\r\n  were to jump into her, and so take our fate. By the time she\r\n  came up with us we had got everything ready to put our design\r\n  in execution, but she fell in the wake of us, we being much\r\n  the larger ship, and hailed our Master to go on board her, who\r\n  answered that he would not leave his ship, and so kept on his\r\n  course. The Sallee Man of War kept us company about an hour, and\r\n  was once, as we thought, coming up to board us; however, she\r\n  thought better of it, fell astern, and stood off without firing a\r\n  shot, being prevented by the wind which blew very fresh, so that\r\n  they could not put a gun out of their ports.\r\n\r\n  “This affair had not been long over when we made the Land, but\r\n  it put our Master in such a fright, that he went quite out of\r\n  his course, so that the Old Head of Kinsale which was the first\r\n  land we made, he took to be the Highlands of Dungarvon, which\r\n  made him stand away to the Southward, instead of directly in to\r\n  the Shore, untill our Master was quite got out of his knowledge,\r\n  and night coming on we were obliged to stand out to sea, the\r\n  wind rising till it blew a storm, insomuch that we were in great\r\n  danger of foundering at sea in an old rotten ship. Next morning\r\n  we stood in towards the shore, the wind still continuing very\r\n  high, and not a soul on board knew where we were, and though we\r\n  made signals of Distress, yet the wind was so high that no boat\r\n  dare venture out to our relief, and had it not been for one of\r\n  our Lieutenants who had been formerly in the West Indies, and\r\n  who remembered something of the Coast, we should certainly have\r\n  perished the night following; by his directions we made shift\r\n  to get into Bantry Bay before night, and very fortunate it was,\r\n  for that night the wind blew so violent that it was with much\r\n  difficulty our Ship could ride it out, with all the anchors and\r\n  cables we had. Next day, being the 24th December, we landed at\r\n  Bantry, and from there marched to Cork, where the other part of\r\n  the Regiment landed some days before.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1701-1717.\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH’S CAMPAIGNS IN THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost before the troops from Flanders had shaken down into their\r\nwinter quarters, the anti-military party in England raised the cry\r\nof “No standing army” with such vigour that Parliament insisted on\r\nthe disbandment of many regiments; in each of the remainder three\r\ncompanies were entirely suppressed, and the others cut down to a\r\nstrength of two sergeants, two corporals, a drummer, and thirty-four\r\nprivate soldiers, while officers at the rate of one for every ten men\r\nwere allowed to remain with the Colours. In 1701 war again broke out\r\non the Continent. This war, known as that of the Spanish Succession,\r\nwas but a sequel to the conflict ended at Ryswick, and was again\r\ncaused by Louis XIV.’s determination to conquer the best part of\r\nEurope. Without waiting for a formal declaration of hostilities,\r\nLouis struck hard and quick; and occupied the fortresses of Ostend,\r\nNieuport, Oudenarde, Ath, Mons, Charleroi, Namur, and Luxemburg, and\r\nnearly all the strongholds on the Meuse from Namur to Venloo, thus\r\nthreatening at once the southern border of Holland and the keys to\r\nits south-eastern frontier, the fortresses of Grave, Nimeguen, and\r\nFort Schenk. The Allies again took up arms; in June the XVIIIth and\r\neleven other regiments were sent off to Holland under Marlborough’s\r\ncommand; and Parliament decided that England should furnish a\r\ncontingent of forty thousand men, of whom eighteen thousand were to\r\nbe British and the remainder foreigners, taken temporarily into our\r\npay.\r\n\r\nBefore the English troops settled down into their winter quarters,\r\nWilliam III. reviewed the infantry, whose uniform was at that time\r\nboth comfortable and picturesque. They wore loosely-fitting red\r\ncoats, cut long enough to protect the thighs from wet and cold;\r\nwaistcoats, visible when the skirts of the coat were buttoned back\r\nto allow the legs free play in marching; breeches with gaiters,\r\nbuttoning high above the knee, and shoes. Their head-dress was a\r\ncocked-hat, like that of a Chelsea pensioner, and their hair was\r\nplaited in a pig-tail, which was plastered with powder and tied up\r\nwith bows.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1702, the Allies discovered that though Louis\r\nhad echeloned considerable numbers of troops along the Rhine and\r\nthe lower Scheldt, his immediate object was to gain possession of\r\nthe fortresses of Grave, Nimeguen, and Fort Schenk: and a force of\r\n25,000 men, among whom were the XVIIIth and most of the other British\r\nregiments, was assembled at Cranenburg, a few miles from Nimeguen,\r\nto watch a French army, 60,000 strong, encamped some twenty miles to\r\nthe southwards. In the absence of Marlborough, who was detained at\r\nthe Hague by diplomatic business, the army on the Meuse was under the\r\nEarl of Athlone, as Ginkell was now called: the French were commanded\r\nnominally by the Duke of Burgundy, but really by de Boufflers, who\r\naccompanied this royal prince as military adviser. The old Marshal\r\nhad not forgotten his humiliation at Namur in 1695; and finding out\r\nthat Athlone’s intelligence department and system of patrolling were\r\nequally bad, by a sudden swoop so nearly surprised his camp that his\r\ntroops had to abandon their camp and baggage and hasten for shelter\r\nto Nimeguen, where their reception was the reverse of cordial. The\r\nGovernor was indignant with the Dutch Government for having promoted\r\nAthlone over his head; he was suspected of having sold himself to\r\nthe enemy, and either from treachery or from the wish to see his\r\nrival cut to pieces, shut the gates upon him as he approached the\r\nfortress,[26] and refused to take any measures for its defence. The\r\ncivilian population, however, had no intention of surrendering; they\r\nbroke open the stores, dragged guns to the ramparts, carried up\r\npowder and shot upon their backs, and opened so furious a fire that\r\nthe French drew off in disgust.\r\n\r\nMarlborough, whose recent appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nallied forces had created much ill-will among the Dutch generals,\r\nnow joined the army, and concentrated 60,000 men, of whom 12,000\r\nwere British, in the neighbourhood of Nimeguen. Never was a general\r\nmore sorely tried by incompetent and jealous subordinates than\r\nMarlborough in this campaign. He was comparatively an unknown man;\r\nhe had never commanded a large army in the field; many of his\r\ncolleagues distrusted him, and took every opportunity of thwarting\r\nhis plans; and, above all, his footsteps were dogged by two Dutch\r\ncivilian officials, styled Field Deputies, who had power to refuse\r\nhim leave to employ the troops of Holland in operations of which\r\nthey did not approve. Four times, by rapid marches and skilful\r\nstrategy, he forced the French into positions where they could only\r\nfight at great disadvantage; and four times was victory snatched\r\nfrom him by the obstinacy of the Dutch leaders or the timidity of\r\nthe Field Deputies. The campaign of 1702, however, was by no means\r\nbarren of results, for Marlborough was allowed to recapture various\r\nfortresses on the Meuse. The first place to be invested was Venloo:\r\nthe Germans sat down before the south and east of the town; to the\r\nDutch and the British was allotted the attack on the north and west,\r\nand, after three weeks’ hard work, the British brigade, of which the\r\nXVIIIth formed part, sapped up to the foot of the glacis of Fort\r\nSt Michael, a strong outwork of the main fortress. Prince Nassau,\r\nwhom Marlborough had deputed to carry on the siege in his absence,\r\nthen ordered a lodgment to be made on the top of the glacis as a\r\npreliminary to a future attack on the covered way. The whole of the\r\nXVIIIth moved into the trenches early in the morning: about midday\r\nthey were joined by three companies of grenadiers and several hundred\r\nmen from the other regiments in the brigade; and in the course of the\r\nafternoon Lord Cutts called the officers together, and, apparently on\r\nhis own responsibility, enlarged the orders originally issued. The\r\nBritish were not to be satisfied with making a lodgment, but if they\r\nfound the French “give way with precipitation, they were to jump into\r\ntheir works and follow them, let the consequence be what it would!\r\n‘These were fine orders from a general,’ remarks Kane grimly, ‘but as\r\ninconsiderate as they were, we as inconsiderately and rashly followed\r\nthem.’”\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock the explosion of a barrel of powder gave the signal\r\nfor the assault; the artillery opened a heavy fire, and the British\r\nadvanced. After a short resistance, the French ran back to the\r\ncovered way, followed by the Royal Irish, who pursued them into a\r\nravelin, where a captain and sixty men fought gallantly till nearly\r\nall were disabled. The survivors rushed towards a small wooden\r\nbridge, spanning a wet ditch eight or ten feet deep and a hundred\r\nfeet in width. The end of this bridge was made of loose planks; and\r\nhad the French done their duty when they crossed it, they would have\r\ntossed these planks into the ditch, and thus made a death-trap, into\r\nwhich the leading British soldiers as they followed them would have\r\nbeen thrust by their comrades in rear. But in their panic the French\r\nforgot to take this precaution; the XVIIIth got safely across, and\r\nchased the enemy to the foot of the wall of the main fortification.\r\nThe men were wild with delight at their success, but the senior\r\nofficers realised that the situation was a desperate one: a few\r\nhundred British troops were entangled among the unbreached works of a\r\nfort, whose garrison, though undoubtedly surprised, had suffered but\r\nlittle in the attack. To retire was out of the question, but to scale\r\nthe wall looming high and grim above them appeared impossible, until\r\nthe fugitives, whom the soldiers were chasing with their bayonets,\r\nsolved the problem by darting to a part of the wall where much grass\r\ngrew, and hauling themselves up from tuft to tuft. Where a Frenchman\r\ncould climb an Irishman could follow, and after a desperate scramble,\r\nthe red-coats began to mount the ramparts, when the enemy, utterly\r\nconfounded by the unconventionality of the assault, hastily retired\r\ninto the body of the fort, threw down their arms, and begged for\r\nquarter. Their lives were spared, and the booty given to the troops.\r\nThis capture cost the British two hundred and ninety-seven killed and\r\nwounded.[27] The casualties among the XVIIIth are not recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the siege came to an end in a very curious way. To\r\ncelebrate a recent victory in another part of Europe, the Allies\r\nparaded all their troops and marched close up to the town to fire a\r\n_feu-de-joie_ into it with shotted guns and muskets. The inhabitants\r\nhad suffered much from the bombardment, especially since the cannon\r\nof Fort St Michael had been turned against them, and when they\r\nsaw the movement, feared that the walls were going to be stormed\r\nforthwith; some rushed to the Governor to urge him to surrender,\r\nwhile others flocked to the ramparts with white cloths in their\r\nhands, crying “Mercy, Mercy, Quarter, Quarter.” The Governor asked to\r\nbe allowed to capitulate, and, says Parker, “as we had other sieges\r\nto carry on this season, the Prince allowed them honourable terms.”\r\n\r\nNassau next took the fortress of Ruremonde after a nine days’ siege,\r\nand then joined Marlborough’s main army near Liege, an open town\r\ncommanded by a citadel and a smaller fort. When the French garrison\r\nheard that the Allies were advancing, they sorrowfully exchanged\r\ntheir comfortable billets in the houses of the burghers for the\r\ncasemates of the forts; and as soon as the enemy had left the town,\r\nthe inhabitants sent a deputation to Marlborough to offer him the\r\ncity keys in token of submission, and to entreat him to preserve\r\nLiege as far as possible from the horrors of war. Cutts, with ten\r\nBritish regiments, was ordered to occupy the town, while the rest of\r\nthe army began operations against the forts. The siege, which lasted\r\neighteen days, ran its ordinary course: batteries were thrown up,\r\ntrenches were dug, outworks were captured, and when the gunners had\r\nmade a practicable breach the assault was delivered. Millner, in his\r\nquaint language, tells us that though the French fought very well,\r\n\r\n  “the Allies after one Hour’s very hot and sharp Dispute beat the\r\n  Enemy from off the Breach, and entered the Fort amongst them\r\n  with Sword in Hand, killing all before them; and had killed all\r\n  therein, had not the French instantly thrown down their arms, and\r\n  earnestly beg’d for Quarter, which our People soon after granted,\r\n  being always prone to give Mercy, when Need most requires....\r\n  Much of the Honour of this Action may be attributed to Lord\r\n  Cutts’ good Conduct, in sending up speedily an assistance of\r\n  Twelve Hundred Men from the ten Battalions in the Town, which\r\n  suddenly rushed in on the side of the Citadel next to the City,\r\n  in the very greatest heat of the action, before the Enemy was\r\n  aware thereof, contrary to their Expectation; the which did very\r\n  much surprize and daunt the Enemy, and made them quit the Breach\r\n  much sooner than could otherwise have been expected.”\r\n\r\nNext day the smaller fort surrendered, and thus, on October 23,\r\n1702, Liege was recovered from the French at a cost of about twelve\r\nhundred killed and wounded, of whom nearly half were British.\r\nThough none of the regimental historians mention any casualties in\r\nthe XVIIIth, it by no means follows that there were none among the\r\nregiment, for Stearne and Kane, Parker and Millner were all such\r\nconfirmed fire-eaters that, as a rule, they appeared to consider it\r\nbeneath their dignity to mention any but very heavy losses. The fall\r\nof Liege marked the end of the campaign, and the British contingent\r\nmarched back to Holland, where the XVIIIth again went into quarters\r\nat Huesdon, the town where they had spent the winter of 1701-2.\r\n\r\nThe year 1703 brought no laurels to the British in Flanders. Dutch\r\nincapacity and obstinacy again hampered Marlborough’s movements; he\r\nfailed to bring the French to battle, and accomplished little beyond\r\nthe retaking of a few small fortresses. At the sieges of two of these\r\nplaces, Huy and Limberg, the XVIIIth was present. The regiment spent\r\nthe first part of the winter at Breda, then reinforced the garrison\r\nof Bergen-op-Zoom, and afterwards returned to Breda, whence it sent\r\na strong detachment to Maestricht.\r\n\r\nBut if little of importance happened on the shores of the North\r\nSea during this campaign, great events took place in the south of\r\nGermany, where the Elector of Bavaria had deserted the coalition and\r\nattached himself to the fortunes of Louis XIV. The Gallo-Bavarians,\r\nas the troops of the new alliance were called, captured several\r\nfortified towns belonging to the Emperor of Austria, and defeated\r\nthe Imperialists at the battle of Hochstädt.[28] Encouraged by these\r\nsuccesses, Louis evolved a plan of campaign almost Napoleonic in its\r\ngrandeur. Its main object was the capture of Vienna. One army was\r\nto force its way from Italy through the Tyrol to Austria; another\r\nwas to march from Strasburg on the Upper Rhine into South Germany,\r\nreinforce the 45,000 Gallo-Bavarians, and join hands with the troops\r\nfrom Italy; while to harass Austria from the rear a strong detachment\r\nwas to be sent to Hungary to help the inhabitants in their chronic\r\nrebellion against the Emperor. In Flanders de Villeroi was to remain\r\non the defensive, while on the Moselle 10,000 troops stood ready to\r\nreinforce either flank.\r\n\r\nOn his side Marlborough had also conceived a daring scheme. As a\r\nsoldier, he saw clearly that a mere war of sieges would produce no\r\ndecisive results; as a politician, he saw equally clearly that the\r\ncoalition would go to pieces unless Austria was delivered from\r\nthe Gallo-Bavarian peril,--and he decided that the best way of\r\nhelping the Emperor was to leave to the Dutch the defence of the Low\r\nCountries, and to carry the war into the heart of Germany. As he\r\nknew that the Dutch would oppose his project to the uttermost, he\r\ntook only two or three of his officers into his confidence; he wrung\r\na reluctant consent from the Dutch Government to the withdrawal of\r\ntroops from Holland by pretending that he was about to attack the\r\nFrench on the Moselle, and for several weeks after he had set his\r\narmy in motion the troops had no idea to which part of the Continent\r\nthey were heading.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 1704, Marlborough began his celebrated march; his force\r\nincluded 16,000 British troops, among whom were the headquarter\r\ncompanies of the XVIIIth, joined a few days later by the detachment\r\nfrom Maestricht. Disregarding the protests of the Dutch and of the\r\npetty princelings whose territories were being threatened by the\r\nFrench, he pushed resolutely forward, and covering from twelve to\r\nfifteen miles a-day worked up the right bank of the Rhine from\r\nCoblentz.[29] As each of the French generals formed different\r\ntheories to account for Marlborough’s unexpected movement, they\r\nfailed to combine against him; on the 3rd of June he crossed the\r\nNecker, and then turned south-east towards Donauwörth, a town on\r\nthe Danube, which he had decided to make his advanced base for the\r\ninvasion of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July the Allies encamped at Amerdingen, and at three\r\no’clock next morning Marlborough marched upon his objective, fifteen\r\nmiles off. He rode with the advance-guard--thirty-five squadrons,\r\nthree regiments of Austrian grenadiers, and six thousand Continental\r\nand British infantry, among the latter being a detachment of the\r\nXVIIIth, about a hundred and thirty of all ranks.[30] The main body\r\nof the army followed two hours later. Pushing on with an escort of\r\ncavalry the Duke began his personal reconnaissance about 9 A.M., and\r\nfound that the town of Donauwörth lay in a valley on the north, or\r\nleft bank of the Danube, and was commanded by a steep and flat-topped\r\nhill. This hill, the Schellenberg, was the key of the position: the\r\nGallo-Bavarians had connected it with the town by field-works, and\r\ntwenty-five hundred horse and ten thousand foot were encamped upon\r\nits summit. During the day Marlborough learned that Louis XIV. had\r\nordered strong columns from Flanders and the Upper Rhine to move upon\r\nSouth Germany; and his keen eyes detected on the farther bank of\r\nthe river preparations for the immediate reception of a large body\r\nof men. He accordingly decided to attack the hill at once, without\r\nwaiting for the whole of his main body to come up: but owing to vile\r\nroads and broken bridges it was not until six o’clock that the troops\r\nwere formed for battle at the foot of the slope, about five hundred\r\nyards in length, which led up to the works on the north-west side\r\nof the Schellenberg. The infantry of the advance-guard were drawn\r\nup in four lines, with the cavalry behind them in two lines; eight\r\nbattalions were in support, and an equal number were in reserve.\r\nDuring the day the cavalry had made fascines, with which the enemy’s\r\nditches were to be filled up, and as soon as these great bundles of\r\nfaggots had been distributed among the infantry the advance began.\r\nUnder a cross fire of artillery, the columns breasted the hill\r\nwithout stopping to fire a shot until they were within eighty yards\r\nof the entrenchments, when a sudden outburst of grape and musketry\r\nmade havoc among the crowded ranks. For a moment the men recoiled\r\nbefore this hail of missiles; then recovering themselves, they pushed\r\non until their leaders reached a hollow road, which in the excitement\r\nof the moment was mistaken for the ditch in front of the works\r\nthey were to storm. Before the blunder was discovered the fascines\r\nhad been thrown in, and consequently when the heads of the columns\r\nreached the real ditch they had no means of crossing it, and were\r\nexposed to such a hurricane of bullets and hand-grenades that when\r\nthe enemy made a furious counter-attack with the bayonet some of the\r\ntroops gave way. Three British regiments saved the situation;[31]\r\nthey stood like rocks; the partially broken corps rallied on them,\r\nand then after a hard struggle drove back their gallant foes into\r\ntheir entrenchments.\r\n\r\nA French officer who commanded one of the battalions that fought so\r\nstoutly on the 1st of July, 1704, has left a lurid picture of the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n  “The English infantry led this attack with the greatest\r\n  intrepidity, right up to our parapet, but they were opposed with\r\n  a courage at least equal to their own. Rage, fury and desperation\r\n  were manifested by both sides, with the more obstinacy as the\r\n  assailants and the assailed were perhaps the bravest soldiers\r\n  in the world. The little parapet which separated the two forces\r\n  became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that could be\r\n  conceived.... It would be impossible to describe in words strong\r\n  enough the carnage that took place during the first attack,\r\n  which lasted a good hour or more. We were all fighting hand to\r\n  hand, hurling them back as they clutched at the parapet; men\r\n  were slaying, or tearing at the muzzles of guns and the bayonets\r\n  which pierced their entrails; crushing under their feet their\r\n  own wounded comrades, and even gouging out their opponents’ eyes\r\n  with their nails, when the grip was so close that neither could\r\n  make use of their weapons. I verily believe that it would have\r\n  been quite impossible to find a more terrible representation of\r\n  Hell itself than was shown in the savagery of both sides on this\r\n  occasion.”[32]\r\n\r\nBy dint of drawing men from the parts of the defences unthreatened\r\nby the Allies, the Gallo-Bavarians were able to keep the troops on\r\nthe north-west of the hill at their full strength: and they repulsed\r\nthe next assault so heavily that it was found necessary to bring a\r\nlarge number of British cavalry into the thick of the fire to support\r\nthe shaken, though by no means beaten, infantry. Our enemies were\r\nbeginning to congratulate themselves on their success, when the\r\nremainder of Marlborough’s main body came into action against the\r\nwest of the hill, where the works had been almost denuded of their\r\ngarrisons; they took these works with little loss, repulsed a charge\r\nof cavalry, and then struck the Gallo-Bavarians in flank. About this\r\ntime the Allies made another attempt to carry the entrenchment, and\r\nwere once more beaten back. So serious did things look that the Scots\r\nGreys were ordered to dismount and attack the works on foot; but\r\nmaddened at the thought that cavalrymen were called in to do the work\r\nwhich foot soldiers had failed to accomplish, the infantry then made\r\none final, desperate effort, and surged triumphantly over the parapet\r\nfrom which they had been repulsed so often. Now at length the French\r\nand the Bavarians, exhausted by their magnificent defence, driven\r\nfrom their works in front and hard pressed in flank, gave way; and\r\ntheir retreat soon degenerated into a rout, as they rushed towards\r\nthe river with all the allied cavalry thundering after them. The\r\nvictory was very complete: of the twelve thousand men who had watched\r\nthe Allies form for the assault not more than three thousand rejoined\r\ntheir regiments; the remainder were killed, wounded, captured, or\r\ndrowned in the waters of the Danube; and thirteen standards, fifteen\r\nguns, and all the stores at Donauwörth fell into the victors’ hands.\r\nBut the success was dearly won, for though the engagement lasted less\r\nthan two hours, it cost the Allies more than five thousand officers\r\nand men. The British, as usual, lost very heavily; 33 officers,\r\namong whom was a major-general, were killed, and 83 wounded; 420\r\n“sergeants and sentinels” were killed, and 1001 wounded; in all 1537,\r\nor “probably more than 33 per cent of the number engaged.”[33] To\r\nthis total the XVIIIth, out of its detachment of 130 officers and\r\nmen, contributed 51, or nearly 40 per cent of its numbers. Captain\r\nM. Leathes, Ensigns J. Pinsent (or Pensant), S. Gilman, and E. Walsh\r\nwere wounded; 1 sergeant and 11 men were killed; 3 sergeants and 32\r\nmen were wounded.[34]\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of Donauwörth the Gallo-Bavarians fell back upon\r\nAugsburg, where they encamped under the guns of the fortress.\r\nMarlborough was not strong enough to attack them, and had to content\r\nhimself with blockading the town while he opened communications with\r\nthe Elector of Bavaria, to whom he offered tempting terms to abandon\r\nLouis and place his excellent troops once more at the disposal of\r\nthe Allies. The Elector spun out the negotiations until he knew\r\ndefinitely that Marshal de Tallard was coming from the Rhine to his\r\nhelp; then he broke them off suddenly, sending word that he would\r\nsooner serve as a private soldier under the King of France than\r\nas a general in the Emperor of Austria’s army. As Marlborough now\r\nlearned from Prince Eugene of Savoy, who commanded a detached force\r\non the Danube, that the French were manœuvring to cut off the allied\r\narmy from its base of supplies, he at once turned northward, and\r\nrecrossing the Danube joined hands with Eugene near Donauwörth. The\r\nsituation had become very serious, for though the immediate pressure\r\non the Emperor of Austria was removed, and the French had made no\r\nattempt to invade his territories from Italy, it was essential to\r\nbring the Gallo-Bavarians to battle and defeat them before further\r\nreinforcements had increased their strength, already greater than\r\nthat of the Allies. It was with much relief, therefore, that on\r\nthe morning of the 12th of August Marlborough discovered that the\r\nFrench and Bavarians had moved down the left, or northern bank of\r\nthe Danube, and were then encamped near the village of Hochstädt,\r\na few miles up stream from his own camping-ground.[35] Their right\r\nflank was protected by the Danube, here an unfordable river, and by\r\nthe village of Blenheim, standing two hundred yards from the water’s\r\nedge. The left rested on Lutzingen, a hamlet at the foot of a chain\r\nof broken and thickly wooded hills, which guaranteed it against\r\na turning movement. Between these villages stretched a plateau,\r\nwhite with long lines of tents; and along the whole of its eastern\r\nfront ran the shallow valley of a tributary of the Danube--the\r\nNebel, a formidable obstacle, for though the stream in itself was\r\ninsignificant the bogs and marshes through which it flowed were\r\nvery difficult to cross, and the side of the valley rose so gently\r\ntowards the camp that it formed a natural glacis, well suited to\r\nthe movements of all arms. Between Blenheim and Lutzingen were two\r\nother villages--Unterglau, on the eastern or far side of the Nebel,\r\nwas occupied as an advanced post; Oberglau, on the western or near\r\nside, was part of the main line of defence. To hold this very strong\r\nposition, about four miles in length, de Tallard who commanded the\r\nGallo-Bavarians could dispose of an army from 56,000 to 60,000\r\nstrong, and sixty guns.\r\n\r\nThough de Tallard had risen to be a Marshal of France, he was by no\r\nmeans a clever man, and by his mistakes at Blenheim he played into\r\nMarlborough’s hands. He failed completely to fathom his adversary’s\r\nmind: because it was the object of the French to starve the allies\r\nout of South Germany rather than to expel them by force of arms, de\r\nTallard did not want to fight a battle, and it did not occur to him\r\nthat Marlborough, with his inferior force of 52,000 men and 52 guns,\r\nmight take the offensive. Again, in the disposition of his troops he\r\nmisinterpreted the military axiom of his period, which warned the\r\nchief of an army encamped on ground where it might possibly become\r\nengaged, to place his troops in the order in which they would be\r\ncalled upon to fight. In drawing up an army the infantry was usually\r\nposted in the centre of the line, with the cavalry on its flanks. To\r\nthis normal or “sealed-pattern” formation Tallard blindly adhered;\r\nbut by treating his wings as distinct units and not as part of a\r\ngreat army he produced much confusion; in the centre of the whole\r\nline the cavalry of both wings met, but without unity of command: and\r\non each side of this mass of 10,000 horsemen were infantry, with more\r\ncavalry on their outer flanks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Marlborough had reconnoitred the enemy’s position he\r\nreturned to camp, and settled the outline of the plan of the battle\r\nwhich he intended to force upon the French and Bavarians next day.\r\nAs their flanks were unassailable he decided to deliver a frontal\r\nattack along their whole line: Eugene, with the right wing, was to\r\nassail the Elector and Marshal de Marsin, who had made the villages\r\nof Lutzingen and Oberglau their respective headquarters; the Duke\r\nwas to carry Blenheim, where de Tallard had established himself, and\r\nbreak through the enemy’s centre between that village and Oberglau.\r\nThe night was spent in marshalling the troops into their places\r\nin the nine columns in which they were to move against the enemy,\r\nand at two o’clock on the morning of August 13, 1704, Marlborough\r\nbegan to advance. A thick white mist overhung the valley of the\r\nDanube, and though it delayed his march, concealed his movements\r\nso effectually that it was six o’clock before the French vedettes\r\ndiscovered that the Allies were upon them; and when an hour later\r\nthe mist lifted, de Tallard to his astonishment saw a great army\r\npreparing to deploy on the far side of the Nebel, the cavalry in\r\nthe centre, the infantry on the flanks. While Eugene was marching\r\nto the ground allotted to him, Marlborough’s troops took up their\r\nappointed places. Opposite Blenheim, on the extreme left, stood a\r\ncolumn under General Cutts, consisting of fourteen British regiments\r\nand several German corps: and on Cutts’s right was the remainder\r\nof the left wing, drawn up in four lines, the first and fourth of\r\ncavalry, the second and third of infantry. The Gallo-Bavarians, as\r\nsoon as they had recovered from their surprise, snatched up their\r\narms and fell in before their tents; and when de Tallard saw a mass\r\nof dull red uniforms at the head of the column threatening Blenheim\r\nhe realised that hard fighting was to be expected near the village,\r\nand crowded into it twenty-six regiments of his best infantry, who\r\nwere so tightly packed that large numbers of the soldiers did not\r\nfire a shot throughout the battle. The French rapidly put Blenheim\r\ninto a state of defence--the walls were loopholed, the garden fences\r\n(or palisades as they were called by the historians of the time)\r\nwere strengthened; the entrances were barricaded with carts, gates,\r\nfurniture from the houses; while twelve squadrons of cavalry, sent\r\nto hold the two hundred yards of ground between the village and the\r\nDanube, entrenched themselves behind a “laager” of waggons. Between\r\nBlenheim and Oberglau de Tallard drew up his cavalry in two lines,\r\nwith a third line in support, composed partly of horsemen, partly\r\nof nine battalions of infantry whose steadiness was doubtful. Some\r\nFrench writers say that these shaky troops were Piedmontese, taken\r\nprisoners in Italy and forced to join Louis XIV.’s service.[36] In\r\nthe centre de Marsin occupied Oberglau with a strong detachment;\r\nbehind the hamlet were posted his infantry and that of the Elector,\r\nand in front of Lutzingen stood a strong body of cavalry.\r\n\r\nWhile his troops were marching into their places the French\r\nCommander-in-Chief added to his many mistakes that of abandoning to\r\nthe Allies the natural glacis already mentioned, and thus giving them\r\na foothold on which to re-form after they had crossed the Nebel.\r\nParker shall tell the story in his own words. While the Allies were\r\npreparing to deploy,\r\n\r\n  “the Elector, Tallard and Marsin went to the top of the steeple\r\n  of Blenheim, from whence they had a fair view of their army: the\r\n  Elector and Marsin were for drawing the Army, as close to the\r\n  marshy Ground they had in their Front as possible, and not suffer\r\n  a man over but on the Points of their Bayonets; but Tallard (a\r\n  haughty proud Frenchman) was on a different Opinion, and said,\r\n  that would be no more than making a drawn Battle of it: that the\r\n  only way to get a compleat Victory would be to draw up their army\r\n  at some small Distance from the Morass, and suffer us to come\r\n  over, and the more there came over the more they were sure to\r\n  kill. Neither the Elector nor Marsin could persuade him out of\r\n  this Notion; they both were very much dissatisfied, and dreading\r\n  the consequence, left him, and went to their Posts.”[37]\r\n\r\nMarlborough had formed for battle long before Eugene was able to do\r\nso, for bad roads, broken ground, and many unexpected difficulties\r\ngreatly retarded the march of the right wing towards the left of\r\nthe French line. Until Eugene was prepared to attack, Marlborough\r\ncould not advance without running the risk of being crushed by\r\nvastly superior forces; and for several hours his horse and foot\r\nwere condemned to inactivity while his guns hotly engaged those of\r\nthe French, which were brought forward towards the Nebel, and fired\r\nat every target within their range. The XVIIIth, as usual, must\r\nhave been well to the front, for Parker mentions that the first\r\ncannon-ball “was aimed at our regiment, but it fell short; the\r\nsecond killed one man, which was the first blood drawn that day.”\r\nAfter the Duke had carefully inspected his batteries, he ordered the\r\nchaplains to read prayers at the head of every regiment, and as soon\r\nas the Service was over, to satisfy himself that all was well with\r\nhis troops and to steady them under the enemy’s bombardment, he rode\r\nslowly along the whole length of his line, exposing himself with\r\nperfect calmness to the projectiles of the French. His extraordinary\r\ntalents, his charm of manner, his unfailing courtesy, his absolute\r\nindifference to danger had already endeared him to the strangely\r\nmixed body of soldiery under his command; and when by a miracle he\r\nescaped all injury from a cannon-ball which struck the ground between\r\nhis horse’s legs, a great sigh of relief went up from the hearts of\r\nBritons and Danes, Germans and Dutch.\r\n\r\nIt was not until twelve o’clock, four hours after the artillery duel\r\nhad begun, that an aide-de-camp galloped up to tell Marlborough\r\nthat Eugene was ready. Then the signal was given, and Cutts, on the\r\nextreme left of the line, moved forward to the attack of Blenheim.\r\nUnder a sharp artillery fire, two of his brigades--one of British,\r\nunder Row, the other of Hessians--succeeded in crossing the Nebel\r\nnear the village, and halted under cover to re-form their ranks;\r\nthen leaving the Hessians in support behind the bank of the stream,\r\nRow’s five regiments advanced to the assault of a position held\r\nby the cream of the French infantry. Until our leading ranks were\r\nwithin thirty paces of the enemy not a shot was fired on either side.\r\nThe British had been ordered to carry Blenheim with the bayonet if\r\npossible, and in no case to burn a cartridge until their General\r\ncould actually touch the palisades. The French waited till their\r\nassailants were so close to them that the worst shot could not\r\nfail to bring down his man. Then so tremendous a burst of musketry\r\nfell upon the head of the column that the French expected to see\r\nthe red-coats break and flee; but our men rushed forward through\r\nthe smoke, cheered on by Row, who succeeded in striking a palisade\r\nwith his sword before he fell mortally wounded. The British gave\r\none volley, and then attempted to storm--some tried to scale the\r\npalisades, others to pull them down, while others again lunged\r\nfiercely through the loopholes at the French marksmen, who fired so\r\nfast and straight that in a few minutes a third of the brigade was\r\nkilled or wounded, and the remainder were in retreat, hotly pursued\r\nby a body of cavalry. Now followed some wild fighting. The Hessians\r\nstruck in with great gallantry, and recaptured Colours which had\r\nbeen lost in the _mêlée_; five British squadrons floundered over\r\nthe Nebel to the rescue of the infantry, and beat back the French\r\nhorsemen; but pursuing with more ardour than judgment, they were\r\ndecoyed under the fire of the infantry in Blenheim and suffered\r\nseverely. The French followed up their success by bringing up more\r\nbatteries to sweep the crossing of the Nebel by which the British\r\nhad advanced; but Cutts soon drove away this audacious artillery\r\nand, returning to the charge, delivered a series of desperate but\r\nineffectual assaults upon the village until Marlborough ordered him\r\nto make no further efforts to storm it, but to fire volleys into it\r\nso continuously that the French would be pinned to their defences,\r\nand therefore unable to reinforce their right centre, which he was\r\nhimself attacking. Parker gives a quaint account of this phase of the\r\nbattle. After describing a gallant but fruitless assault, he says--\r\n\r\n  “The rest of the Foot coming up, they renewed the charge; and\r\n  those that had been repulsed, having soon rallied, returned\r\n  to the charge, and drove the enemy from the skirts of the\r\n  village, into the very heart of it. Here they had thrown up\r\n  an intrenchment, within which they were pent up in so narrow\r\n  a compass, that they had not room to draw up in any manner of\r\n  order, or even to make use of their arms. Thereupon we drew up in\r\n  great order about 80 paces from them, from which we made several\r\n  vain attempts to break in upon them, in which many brave men were\r\n  lost to no purpose; and after all, we were obliged to remain\r\n  where we first drew up. The enemy also made several attempts\r\n  to come out upon us: but as they were necessarily thrown into\r\n  confusion in getting over their trenches, so before they could\r\n  form into any order for attacking us, we mowed them down with\r\n  our platoons in such numbers, that they were always obliged to\r\n  retire with great loss; and it was not possible for them to rush\r\n  out upon us in a disorderly manner, without running upon the very\r\n  points of our Bayonets.”\r\n\r\nWhile this fierce combat was raging at Blenheim, Marlborough had\r\nsucceeded, though slowly and with great difficulty, in throwing a\r\nconsiderable number of troops over the Nebel near Oberglau. In the\r\nmorning the French generals had sneered at the Duke for placing\r\ngreat bodies of infantry between his first and second lines of\r\nhorse; in the afternoon they discovered that there was method in the\r\nEnglishman’s madness. Foreseeing that the cavalry would arrive on\r\nthe far side of the stream with their horses blown and their ranks\r\nbroken, he sent a large number of battalions to lead the way, with\r\norders to push far enough up the enemy’s side of the valley to leave\r\nroom for the allied cavalry to re-form behind their fire. The French\r\nhorsemen charged down upon the disordered squadrons, but even where\r\nmomentarily successful they were forced ultimately to retire by the\r\nmusketry of the infantry, and failed to prevent Marlborough’s second\r\nline of cavalry from crossing the Nebel. During this stage of the\r\nbattle, eleven battalions of Hanoverians attempted to capture the\r\nvillage of Oberglau, but were met by a magnificent counter-attack\r\nof the Irish Brigade--the men who after the surrender at Limerick\r\nhad joined the army of the King of France. The Irishmen annihilated\r\ntwo battalions, and smashed through the remainder of the column; but\r\nthen dashing on too far, were thrown into confusion by a charge of\r\ncavalry, and finally driven back with great loss by the fire of three\r\nfresh battalions which Marlborough threw against their flank.\r\n\r\nOn the right, meanwhile, things were not going well for the Allies.\r\nThe Elector, disregarding de Tallard’s order to keep the troops\r\nhigh up on the slope, had moved his infantry right down to the edge\r\nof the broken ground near the Nebel, and thus met Eugene’s men\r\nwhile they were scattered and exhausted by the difficulties of the\r\ncrossing; thrice did the Prince of Savoy make a formidable attack\r\nupon the Bavarians, and thrice was he beaten back. On the left,\r\nhowever, Cutts was fulfilling his mission admirably, for his rolling\r\nmusketry detained within the entrenchments of Blenheim the enormous\r\nmass of infantry, whose presence on other parts of the field might\r\nhave turned the scale in favour of the French. But the fate of the\r\nbattle was to be decided in the centre, where Marlborough had now\r\nsucceeded in placing eight thousand cavalry in two long lines on the\r\nlower slope of the natural glacis which de Tallard had abandoned\r\nso unaccountably to his enemy. To meet this danger, the French\r\nCommander-in-Chief called up the nine battalions which in the morning\r\nhe had considered unfit to use in the forefront of the battle, and\r\nposted them level with the first line of his cavalry. The Duke met\r\nthis move by bringing to his front a battery and three battalions of\r\nHanoverians, who engaged the French infantry at short range, and so\r\ngreatly shook them that they were unable to withstand a charge of\r\ncavalry which swept them away, leaving a huge gap in de Tallard’s\r\nline. That general now had to pay for the vicious dispositions by\r\nwhich the cavalry in his centre had been posted without proper\r\narrangements for combined action. The horsemen of de Marsin’s right\r\nwing played, not for the safety of the whole French army, but for\r\nthat of their own commander, and instead of flinging themselves into\r\nthe breach and presenting an unbroken front to Marlborough, wheeled\r\nbackwards in order to protect the flank of the column to which they\r\nbelonged. De Marsin had his hands too full to be able to spare a man\r\nto help de Tallard, and before any of the infantry from Blenheim\r\ncould come to the rescue the Duke’s eight thousand troopers were\r\ncharging up the slope; for a moment the French cavalry stood, then\r\nseized with a mad panic they wheeled about and galloped furiously for\r\nthe river, riding down everything they met in their haste to escape\r\nfrom the German horsemen, who sabred hundreds of them and drove\r\nhundreds more into the Danube.\r\n\r\nDe Marsin and the Elector were in no condition to continue the battle\r\nafter the rout of Tallard’s wing; they retired in fair order, pursued\r\nby Eugene’s troops. To turn their retreat into a rout Marlborough\r\ncalled off his Germans from the congenial task of cutting their\r\nenemies to pieces, and sent them to fall upon de Marsin’s flank:\r\nbut it was now late in the evening; the Germans overtook not de\r\nMarsin’s column but Eugene’s; in the growing darkness each side\r\nthought the other was the enemy and halted to prepare to fight, and\r\nby the time that the mistake had been discovered and mutual apologies\r\npresented and accepted the Gallo-Bavarians’ right wing had gained so\r\nlong a start that further pursuit was hopeless. The battalions in\r\nBlenheim were less fortunate, for the Allies blocked every egress\r\nwith cavalry, and called up infantry to storm the village, when the\r\nluckless Frenchmen reluctantly agreed to surrender, and twenty-four\r\nbattalions of infantry and four regiments of dragoons laid down\r\ntheir arms, and filing through a double line of troops were guarded\r\nthroughout the night by the British regiments.\r\n\r\nHistory records few defeats more crushing than that of the French\r\nand Bavarians at Blenheim. On the morning of the 13th of August\r\nTallard commanded about 60,000 troops, of whom not more than 20,000\r\never found their way back to the armies of France or of Bavaria. The\r\ncarnage in the battle itself was very great, and in the flight large\r\nnumbers of the French were drowned in the Danube or murdered by the\r\npeasants, who, with many old scores to settle, showed no mercy to\r\nsmall parties of disbanded soldiers unable to protect themselves.\r\nAmong the 11,000 prisoners was Marshal de Tallard; and many guns and\r\nmortars, 171 standards, 129 pairs of colours, much bullion, hundreds\r\nof pack animals, and the whole of the camp equipage fell into the\r\nhands of the conquerors. The victory, however, cost the Allies about\r\n12,500 officers and men, or roughly twenty-four per cent of the force\r\nwith which Marlborough began the battle. The British casualties,\r\naccording to Millner’s return,[38] amounted to two thousand three\r\nhundred and twenty-four of all ranks.\r\n\r\nAs a bounty was granted to those who took part in the battle the\r\nnames of the officers present have been preserved. The Colonel,\r\nFrederick Hamilton, was in charge of a brigade, and drew £72. The\r\nregiment was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. Stearne, and the\r\nMajor was Richard Kane: the former received £51, and the latter\r\n£90. To each of the Captains--John Moyle, Peter d’Offranville, Jos.\r\nStroud, F. de la Penotière, N. Hussey, Henry Browne, A. Rolleston,\r\nand W. Vaughan (or Vauclin), £30 was paid. The Captain-Lieutenant,\r\nThos. Laughlin, and the Lieutenants--George Hall, James Lilly,\r\nRobert Parker, Wm. Leathes, Ben. Smith, Wm. Blakeney, W. Weddall (or\r\nWeddell), Saml. Roberts, and John Harvey, drew £14 a head; while £11\r\nwas the sum awarded to each of the Ensigns--John Blakeney, Henry\r\nWalsh, John Cherry, W. Rolleston, Samuel Smith, R. Tripp, Edward\r\nWalsh, and W. Moyle. The Quartermaster, Edm. Arwater, was rated as a\r\nlieutenant, and the Adjutant, W. Blakeney, at £2 less; the Surgeon,\r\nR. Weldon, received £12; his mate, R. Taylor, was considered only\r\nworth £7, 10s.; and as the Chaplain, the Reverend Henry Reynolds,\r\ndrew £20, or rather more than the combined bounties of both doctors,\r\nit would seem that in Marlborough’s army the care of the soul was\r\nbetter paid than that of the body. There were a hundred and sixty-six\r\ncasualties in the XVIIIth, or about thirty per cent of those present.\r\nAmong the officers Captains H. Browne and A. Rolleston and Ensign\r\nW. Moyle were killed: Captain W. Vaughan (or Vauclin) was mortally\r\nwounded: Major R. Kane, Captains F. de la Penotière and N. Hussey,\r\nLieutenants W. Weddall (or Weddell), S. Roberts, J. Harvey, B.\r\nSmith, W. Blakeney, and Ensign R. Tripp were wounded. In the other\r\nranks five sergeants were killed and nine wounded; fifty-two private\r\nsoldiers were killed and eighty-seven wounded.[39]\r\n\r\nThe morning after the battle Marlborough marched a few miles up the\r\nriver, and then encamped for four days to rest his weary troops, to\r\nset his hospitals in order, and to dispose of his prisoners, of whom\r\nMillner speaks as “a luggage that retarded our progress.” During\r\nthis respite from organised pursuit the French hurried back to the\r\nRhine, whither they were followed by the Allies, who laid siege to\r\nthe fortress of Landau. The XVIIIth was employed in the covering\r\narmy, and in the middle of October, a few weeks before the place was\r\ntaken, all the British infantry were embarked on river boats and\r\nfloated down the Rhine to Nimeguen, where after a ten days’ voyage\r\nthey disembarked, so greatly reduced by their losses in the campaign\r\nthat for administrative purposes the fourteen regiments were treated\r\nas seven provisional battalions. The troops marched to their winter\r\nquarters to enjoy a well-earned rest and to discipline the recruits\r\nwho joined them from home. While the XVIIIth was at Ruremonde, where\r\nit spent several months, Brigadier Frederick Hamilton retired from\r\nthe service,[40] and was succeeded as Colonel by Lieutenant-General\r\nR. Ingoldsby, from the 23rd regiment of Foot.\r\n\r\nThe year 1705 afforded the XVIIIth no opportunities of adding to its\r\nlaurels, for as far as the regiment was concerned the campaign was\r\none of hard marching, great fatigue, and no fighting. Marlborough\r\nhad planned an invasion of France, and again entrusting to the\r\nDutch the defence of the Low Countries led his British contingent\r\nand a large number of their Continental Allies towards the Moselle,\r\nwhence he hoped to overrun Lorraine and then carry the war into\r\nthe enemy’s country. He expected to be joined by a strong body of\r\nGermans under the Prince of Baden, a general from whose jealousy\r\nand stupidity he had suffered acutely in the operations of 1704;\r\nbut after waiting many weeks for reinforcements which never came,\r\nMarlborough determined to return to Flanders, where the enemy had\r\nbegun to show alarming signs of activity. Though Marshal de Villars,\r\none of the best soldiers of France, was watching his movements\r\nclosely, Marlborough broke up his camp and slipped away unmolested by\r\nthe French, who were nearly double his strength. With the elaborate\r\npoliteness of the time, he wrote to de Villars to apologise for\r\nretreating without giving battle. “Do me the justice,” said he,\r\n“to believe that my defeat is entirely owing to the failure of the\r\nPrince of Baden, but that my esteem for you is still greater than my\r\nresentment for his conduct.”[41]\r\n\r\nWhen de Villeroi, who commanded the French in Flanders, heard that\r\nMarlborough was coming back from the Moselle, he hastily retired to\r\na series of fortified lines stretching from Namur to Antwerp. These\r\nlines the Duke determined to force, and by a series of brilliant\r\nmanœuvres and rapid marches succeeded in driving de Villeroi from\r\nthem, with much loss to the French and little to the Allies. But to\r\ninflict a decisive blow upon the enemy a great battle was necessary.\r\nMarlborough twice placed the French in situations where they would\r\nhave to fight at a disadvantage, and twice the Dutch generals, in\r\ntheir insane jealousy of the British Commander-in-Chief, forbade the\r\naction by refusing to allow their soldiers to engage. The XVIIIth\r\nappears to have spent much of the campaign in levelling the captured\r\nlines, and when the work was finished, wintered at Worcom, where in\r\nJanuary, 1706, Lieutenant-Colonel Stearne received his brevet of\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the campaign of 1706 found Marlborough more determined\r\nthan ever to defeat de Villeroi in a pitched battle; and in order\r\nto draw the French general from his fortified lines on the river\r\nDyle, he gave him to understand through a secret agent that, as the\r\nAllies realised the Marshal was afraid of them, they were about to\r\nbesiege Namur, one of the fortresses of which Louis had repossessed\r\nhimself by his vigorous action in 1701. The bait took. Stung by this\r\ninsult, de Villeroi quitted the shelter of his fortifications and\r\nmarched to Tirlemont, apparently heading for Namur. When Marlborough\r\nheard the welcome news, he pushed south-west from Maestricht, with\r\nan army little inferior in numbers to de Villeroi’s 60,000 troops,\r\nand on the 22nd of May encamped at Coswaren, where he learned that\r\nde Villeroi was moving upon Judoigne. The Duke decided to attack the\r\nFrench there, and at 1 A.M. on Whitsunday, May 23, 1706, he sent an\r\nadvance party under his Quartermaster-General, Cadogan, to select\r\na camping-ground near the village of Ramillies, which lies on the\r\neastern edge of the highest table-land in this part of Belgium.[42]\r\nOwing to a heavy mist, it was not until eight o’clock that Cadogan\r\ndiscovered that there were hostile troops upon the plateau. Two hours\r\nlater the sun came out, and revealed to each army the presence of\r\nthe other, the French moving eastward across the plateau, the Allies\r\nadvancing from the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe main body of Marlborough’s troops had marched two hours after\r\nthe Quartermaster-General’s detachment, but the Duke had overtaken\r\nCadogan early in the day, and began to array his eight columns for\r\nbattle. De Villeroi, who had the advantage of a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe ground, took up a defensive position, marked on the right by the\r\nvillage of Taviers, in the centre by Ramillies and Offuz, and on the\r\nleft by a hamlet known as Autre-Eglise or Anderkirche. A few hundred\r\nyards to the south of Taviers the river Mehaigne ran from west to\r\neast through bogs and marshes; from Taviers northwards to Ramillies,\r\na distance of about a mile and a half, the soil was firm and well\r\nsuited for cavalry, but along the remainder of the French line,\r\nabout a mile and a quarter in length, the Little Geete meandered in\r\na shallow valley through morasses which opposite Autre-Eglise were\r\nalmost impassable. These villages were strongly held by infantry and\r\nartillery, twenty battalions and twenty-four guns being allotted\r\nto the defence of Ramillies alone. On the extreme left, between\r\nAutre-Eglise and Offuz, were infantry supported by cavalry; from\r\nOffuz to Ramillies the line was composed of infantry, while a hundred\r\nand twenty squadrons, “interlaced” with a few battalions, were massed\r\nbetween that village and Taviers.\r\n\r\nMarlborough decided to attack the French right, between Ramillies and\r\nthe Mehaigne; and as his reconnaissance showed him that de Villeroi\r\nhad concentrated the greater part of his force upon this part of his\r\nline, he determined, by demonstrating against the Marshal’s left,\r\nto induce him to send reinforcements to that flank, and thus weaken\r\nthe remainder of his position. An imposing number of battalions\r\naccordingly marched towards the Little Geete, descended into the\r\nvalley opposite Autre-Eglise and Offuz, and made ostentatious\r\npreparations for throwing pontoon bridges over the stream. On the\r\nextreme right of the allied infantry were several British regiments,\r\nwhich the French staff easily identified by their uniforms and their\r\nColours; and when the Marshal heard that the soldiers whom he so\r\ngreatly feared were facing the left of his line, he drew largely\r\nfrom his right and centre to strengthen the threatened spot. The\r\nDuke had successfully “bluffed” de Villeroi; it now remained for\r\nhim to transfer the greater part of the infantry employed in this\r\ndemonstration to the points where they were really wanted. On the\r\neastern side of the valley of the Little Geete are hillocks, high\r\nenough to conceal the ground beyond them from observers on the\r\nplateau; and over these hillocks the leading battalions retired\r\ngradually; disappeared, and once out of the enemy’s sight, hastened\r\nto the centre of the line. The British brought up the rear, but\r\nwere ordered to halt at the top, turn about and face the enemy: and\r\nthere throughout the battle several regiments remained, not firing a\r\nshot, but by their mere presence immobilising the French left wing,\r\nand effectually preventing it from giving the help urgently needed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBy one o’clock the Duke’s preparations were finished, and after a\r\npreliminary cannonade four Dutch battalions were launched against\r\nTaviers; twelve battalions of the same nationality attacked\r\nRamillies; while a great body of Dutch cavalry stood waiting to\r\nadvance when one or other of these villages had fallen into the\r\nhands of the infantry. The garrison of Taviers fought well, but\r\nowing to the blundering of a French staff officer the reinforcements\r\nsent to its support did not arrive in time to prevent its capture,\r\nand as soon as the Dutch cavalry saw that their left flank could\r\nnot be enfiladed from the village they charged the French horse,\r\ncrashed through the first line, and then were so roughly handled\r\nby the second that Marlborough had to bring up many squadrons to\r\ntheir help. But these fresh squadrons did not turn the scale, and\r\nbefore the Dutchmen could be induced to rally, Marlborough--the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the allied army, on whose life depended not\r\nonly the issue of the battle, but of the whole war--had to plunge\r\ninto the thick of the _mêlée_ and exert his personal influence with\r\nthe troopers, to all of whom he was well known by sight. But his face\r\nand figure were familiar also to the enemy. Some French dragoons\r\nbroke from their ranks to surround him. He was unhorsed, and would\r\nhave been killed or captured had not his aide-de-camp mounted him\r\non his own charger. The Dutch then recovered themselves, and the\r\ntimely arrival of twenty more squadrons turned the tide against the\r\nFrench. While this cavalry fight was in progress, the Danish Horse\r\nand the Dutch Guards forced their way through the marshes on the bank\r\nof the Mehaigne, turned the French right flank, and fell furiously\r\nupon their rear. Encouraged by this good news the main body of Dutch\r\ncavalry returned to the charge, and with a final effort shattered\r\nthe enemy in front of them. Thus assailed on three sides, the cavalry\r\nof de Villeroi’s right wing lost heart, left the infantry to shift\r\nfor themselves, and galloped madly off the field.\r\n\r\nThe battalions who defended the village of Ramillies, mindful of\r\nthe fate of their comrades at Blenheim, determined to retire before\r\nthey were completely hemmed in, but as they “could not get out but\r\nin great disorder our Horse fell in with them and cut most of them\r\nto pieces.”[43] The Duke then ordered the brigades of infantry which\r\nwere massed round Ramillies to bring up their left shoulders and\r\nadvance against the still unbroken troops at Offuz; but the French\r\ndid not await their attack; and a couple of British regiments from\r\nthe extreme right worked through the swamps near Autre-Eglise, and\r\ndrove the enemy from that hamlet. Though a few of the best French\r\ncavalry regiments fought hard to cover the retreat, the greater part\r\nof de Villeroi’s army was routed and fled in panic, hotly pursued by\r\nMarlborough’s horsemen, among whom the British squadrons were well to\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nThe French lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners about 11,000 men,\r\n80 standards and colours, 50 guns, and much of the baggage of their\r\narmy. The Allies on their side lost between 4000 and 5000 men,\r\nchiefly among the Dutch and the Danes, to whom the honour of this\r\ngreat victory is mainly due.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious conflict of evidence as to the part played by\r\nthe Royal Irish in this battle. According to Kane and Parker, the\r\nXVIIIth was among the British regiments which, on the extreme right\r\nof the allied line, stood all day on a hill without firing a shot.\r\nStearne, on the other hand, records in his journal that the regiment\r\nwas “greatly mauled” at the attack on the village of Ramillies; and\r\nMillner, at the end of his casualty return (in which the losses of\r\nthe different nationalities are not given), mentions that “upwards of\r\nthree hundred of our Horse and Dragoon horses were killed or disabled\r\nat the head of the Royal Regiment of Foot of Ireland.” If Stearne and\r\nMillner are correct, it would appear that the XVIIIth was not only\r\nemployed in the attack on Ramillies, but was also in close support of\r\nthe mounted troops during some part of the pursuit.[44]\r\n\r\nMarlborough’s enemies had blamed him for slackness in not profiting\r\nby his victory at Blenheim; but not even his most virulent political\r\nopponents could impute want of vigour to him after Ramillies.\r\nAlthough his infantry had paraded before 3 A.M., had marched many\r\nmiles and had won a great victory, he gave them no rest till 1 A.M.\r\non the 24th, when they were allowed to halt for two hours; then they\r\ntrudged on “with all the expedition they could without observing any\r\nother order than this, that every regiment kept their men as close\r\ntogether as they possibly could, and none of them halted above an\r\nhour at a time.”[45] Marlborough drove the French back into their own\r\ncountry, and within a fortnight of the battle all the great trading\r\ntowns had opened their gates to the Allies, while very few fortresses\r\nin Flanders remained in the hands of Louis XIV.’s troops. Over the\r\nwalls of Ostend, Dendermonde, and Menin the French flag still flew,\r\nbut these towns were attacked and taken in the course of a few weeks.\r\n\r\nAt the capture of Menin, one of Vauban’s masterpieces of\r\nfortification, the XVIIIth won much glory. In July the Duke detached\r\n20,000 troops to besiege it; and though the garrison of 5000 men\r\nfought admirably and disputed every inch of ground, by the end of\r\nthe month most of the guns were dismounted, and the approaches of\r\nthe British brigade had reached the foot of the glacis. The next\r\nstep was to capture the covered way and counterscarp; and about\r\neight o’clock on the evening of the 7th of August, nine complete\r\nbattalions, of which the XVIIIth was one, delivered the assault. As\r\nStearne remarks, “this proved warm service,” for, as the Allies were\r\nswarming up the glacis, two mines were sprung upon them; and when the\r\ninevitable confusion was over and the attack was resumed, the French\r\nfired venomously at the crest of the glacis, where the British were\r\ncovering the advance of the working parties bringing wool-packs and\r\nfascines with which to throw up entrenchments. The Royal Irish and\r\nLauder’s, an unnumbered corps since disbanded, appear to have been\r\nat the head of the column, and were so much annoyed by this musketry\r\nthat without orders they began to reply to it. The flashes of their\r\nfirelocks gave the French a target, and before the officers could\r\nstop the firing the losses in these two regiments had been great.\r\nStearne, who was in command of the XVIIIth, says that the action\r\ncost him six officers and more than eighty of the other ranks killed\r\nand wounded. Parker, the adjutant of the regiment, mentions that two\r\ncaptains and five subalterns were killed and eight other officers\r\nwounded, but is silent about the casualties among the sergeants\r\nand private soldiers. Millner agrees with the adjutant about the\r\nofficers and with the colonel about the men.[46] Notwithstanding\r\ntheir losses, the Allies held the crest of the glacis until eight\r\no’clock next morning, when the working parties had finished the\r\nentrenchments; then fresh batteries began to play upon the walls,\r\nand in a short time the resistance was fairly beaten down and the\r\ngarrison surrendered on honourable terms. The siege lasted thirty-one\r\ndays, and cost the French eleven hundred officers and men, while\r\nthe Allies’ strength was diminished by two thousand six hundred\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1707, the Allies assembled at Bethlehem, where the\r\nBritish contingent was joined by the Royal Irish from their winter\r\nquarters at Ghent. Owing to the underhand conduct of the Emperor\r\nof Austria, who for his private ends made a secret treaty with\r\nLouis XIV. for the neutralisation of Italy, the French were able\r\nto withdraw their troops from that country and largely reinforce\r\nthe Marshal de Vendôme, who had succeeded de Villeroi in command\r\nof their “army of Flanders.” But de Vendôme had no wish to fight\r\nMarlborough, and a long spell of very bad weather helped him to evade\r\nall the Duke’s efforts to bring him to battle. Stearne in his journal\r\nmentions that “there fell such rain that our men were not able to\r\ndraw their legs after them, neither could they keep their arms or\r\nammunition dry.” On one occasion the Allies were struggling over nine\r\nmiles of country, along which the French had just retreated, “but\r\nwhat with the enemy marching before us, and our Horse which followed\r\nthem, and the rain continuing the roads were so deep and miry that\r\nthe most part of our infantry were not able to reach the camp that\r\nnight, and it was three or four days before the rear came up, and\r\nseveral of them perished by the way.”[47]\r\n\r\nIn the hope of raising a rebellion in North Britain, Louis XIV.\r\nattempted early in 1708 to land the Pretender in Scotland, with a\r\nhandful of French soldiers to train the partisans who were expected\r\nto flock to the standard of the Stuart Prince. The expedition\r\nsailed long before the campaign opened on the Continent; to meet\r\nit the XVIIIth and nine other regiments were hurriedly shipped off\r\nto Shields, where the transports anchored while their escort of\r\nmen-of-war joined in the chase of the enemy’s vessels, which were\r\ndriven back to France. As soon as the danger was over the troops\r\nwere sent off to Ostend, where they arrived in full time to rejoin\r\nMarlborough’s army.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year it became evident that Louis intended to make a\r\ngreat effort to regain the ground he had lost in Flanders, for he\r\nassembled a hundred thousand men behind his frontier fortresses, and\r\nplaced them under the command of his grandson the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nwith de Vendôme as his military tutor and adviser. As Marlborough had\r\nbut eighty thousand troops at his immediate disposal, he arranged\r\nthat Eugene, the Prince of Savoy, who was in charge of the allied\r\nforces on the Rhine, should support him whenever he wanted help. This\r\nhelp was soon required, for the French took the initiative, and at\r\nthe end of May advanced to the forest of Soignies. While Marlborough\r\nconcentrated at Hal, de Vendôme rapidly despatched detachments to\r\nBruges and Ghent, where the civil authorities were in his pay; and\r\nwhen Louis’ soldiers appeared outside the walls, the gates stood\r\nopen before them. Having thus secured two very important points in\r\nthe system of waterways connected with the Lys and the Scheldt, de\r\nVendôme next threatened Brussels; and by forcing Marlborough to\r\nmove to Asche for its protection, gained time to prepare for the\r\nattack on Oudenarde, the capture of which would make him master of\r\nthe greater part of the Scheldt. He proposed to cover the siege\r\noperations from Lessines, a place about thirteen miles south-east\r\nof Oudenarde, and hoped to establish his main body there before\r\nMarlborough had grasped his plan; but the Duke’s secret service\r\nagents did not fail him, and when he learned that de Vendôme was to\r\nmove southwards from his camp at Alost on July 9, he determined to\r\noutstrip him by starting from Asche long before dawn on the same\r\nday. As the reinforcements from the Rhine had not yet arrived, in\r\npoint of actual numbers the Allies were considerably weaker than\r\nthe French; but Eugene, leaving his own troops many marches behind\r\nhim, had recently joined the English general--and the mere presence\r\nof Eugene was in itself worth many thousand men. In a straight line\r\nthe Allies and the French had about the same distance, twenty miles,\r\nto march, but by the roads followed by the Allies the mileage was\r\nnearly fifty per cent greater. Almost without a pause, Marlborough’s\r\ntroops tramped steadily from 2 A.M. till noon, when, with fifteen\r\nmiles to their credit, they halted till the evening, though Cadogan’s\r\ndetachment of eight squadrons and as many battalions was allowed\r\nonly four hours’ rest before starting for Lessines, thirteen miles\r\nfarther on. Throughout the night the main body pressed forward and\r\nreached their destination to find that their exertions had not been\r\nthrown away--they had outmarched the French: no enemy was in sight,\r\nand Cadogan, who had struggled into Lessines at midnight, had already\r\nthrown several pontoon bridges across the river Dender. Not until\r\nthe Allies had reached their camping ground did the heads of the\r\nFrench columns begin to show on the horizon; and when de Vendôme and\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy realised that Marlborough lay between them and\r\nFrance, they abandoned all hope of besieging Oudenarde, and fell back\r\non the Scheldt to secure the safety of Bruges.\r\n\r\nMarlborough decided to follow them, and Cadogan with eleven thousand\r\ntroops of all arms, including Sabine’s brigade of the 8th, XVIIIth,\r\n23rd, and 37th regiments, quietly left the camp in the small hours of\r\nJuly 11. The duty of this advance-guard was to make all preparations\r\nfor the crossing from the right bank of the Scheldt to the left by\r\nthe main body, which was due to arrive at Oudenarde a few hours\r\nafter Cadogan. Between 10 and 11 A.M. its cavalry scouts had crossed\r\nthe river a few hundred yards below the town, and were riding up\r\nto the thickly enclosed table-land between the principal stream\r\nand its northern affluent, the Norken,[48] when they saw to their\r\nfront a number of French troopers scouring the country for forage.\r\nVendôme had marched down the right bank to Gavre, a few miles below\r\nOudenarde, and was then in process of crossing the Scheldt. These\r\nforaging parties were part of the French advance-guard, for de\r\nVendôme, who apparently had taken no steps to watch the movements\r\nof the Allies, was so unconscious of danger that many of his men\r\nhad been allowed to disperse. The French Horse, however, quickly\r\nrecovered from their surprise at finding Marlborough on their heels,\r\nand drove back our scouts, discovering in the course of the pursuit\r\nthat a body of his cavalry was on the plateau near the village of\r\nEyne, and that some of the bridges over the river near Oudenarde were\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as de Vendôme realised the situation he decided to form\r\nalong the slopes overlooking the Scheldt; the line was to stretch\r\nfrom Heurne on his left to Mooregem on his right, and after ordering\r\na detachment of cavalry and seven battalions to occupy Heurne, he\r\nrode back to report his dispositions to the Duke of Burgundy, whom\r\nhe found at breakfast. French writers say that the Prince greatly\r\ndisliked any interruption at his meals, and the news that the Allies\r\nwere on the same bank of the river as himself was very unwelcome.\r\nThere was already great friction between the Prince and his military\r\n“bearleader”; and to vent his spleen upon the Marshal the Duke of\r\nBurgundy peremptorily rejected the veteran’s plan, and insisted on\r\npreparing to give battle, not close to the bank of the Scheldt, where\r\nthere was a good chance of crushing Marlborough’s columns as they\r\ncame piece-meal into action, but two miles farther back, on the far\r\nside of the Norken, with his left at Asper and his right at Wannegem.\r\nFrom that moment things began to go wrong with the French. In the\r\nconfusion caused by the rejection of the Marshal’s scheme no one\r\nthought of recalling the cavalry and infantry ordered to Heurne: and\r\nthese luckless troops marched steadily towards a village which they\r\nbelieved to be Heurne, though it proved to be the hamlet of Eyne,\r\nwell within the reach of Cadogan’s infantry.\r\n\r\nWhile the French generals were laboriously forming their army behind\r\nthe Norken, Cadogan was throwing pontoon bridges over the Scheldt,\r\nand anxiously scanning the horizon for the clouds of dust which would\r\nherald the march of the main body of the Allies. But the day was\r\nstifling, the roads narrow and bad; it was not until two o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon that the heads of the columns began to reach the river,\r\nand thus set Cadogan free to secure for his chief a good foothold on\r\nthe left bank. The first thing to be done was to drive the French\r\nout of Eyne; and a body of Hanoverian cavalry and three brigades of\r\ninfantry from the advance-guard were ordered to attack the village.\r\nSabine’s brigade of British was in front, and as it was led by the\r\nRoyal Irish, the XVIIIth was the first regiment under fire at the\r\nbattle of Oudenarde. Though the garrison of Eyne were conscious that\r\nthey had been stranded in an impossible position, so far in advance\r\nof their main line that they could not hope to be reinforced, they\r\nfought well at first; but when they realised that they were heavily\r\noutnumbered they lost heart: three battalions surrendered: the others\r\nwere hustled out of the village at the point of the bayonet, and then\r\nfell into the hands of the Hanoverians, who after cutting them to\r\npieces charged the detachment of French cavalry posted near Eyne and\r\nchased it into the marshes of the Norken.[49] Cadogan followed up his\r\nsuccess by pushing two Prussian regiments towards Groenewald, thus to\r\nsome extent protecting the right flank of the main body as it crossed\r\nthe Scheldt.\r\n\r\nThe French troops who had been powerless to help their comrades\r\nat Eyne became clamorous to avenge them, and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, seeing how slowly the Allies defiled over the bridges,\r\ndetermined to take the offensive, and ordered his right and centre\r\nto advance. About five o’clock a formidable mass of infantry\r\nthreatened Groenewald, where the Prussians would have fared badly\r\nhad they not been reinforced at once by twelve battalions of the\r\nadvance-guard, who, as they came into action, prolonged the line to\r\nthe left--_i.e._, southwards, towards the hamlet of Schaerken. But\r\nas the French continued to gain ground on this part of the field\r\ntwenty battalions from the main body were flung into the fray, and by\r\ncontinuing to extend to the left as they joined the fighting line,\r\nrepulsed a dangerous attempt by the enemy to turn the left of the\r\nAllies at this point.\r\n\r\nIn the enclosures round Groenewald every hedge and ditch became a\r\nminiature fortress, taken and retaken as the tide of battle ebbed\r\nand flowed; and near the village of Schaerken the Allies could\r\nhardly keep the enemy in check until the Duke reinforced this part\r\nof the line. Then slowly, and with great difficulty, the Dutch and\r\nHanoverians forced the French back a few hundred yards to Diepenbeck;\r\nbut there they met with so stubborn a resistance that they could gain\r\nno further ground. Some writers say that the French infantry had\r\nfallen back to a belt of abattis prepared earlier in the day; be that\r\nas it may, the fact remains that at this point de Vendôme’s infantry\r\nfought magnificently, and brought Marlborough’s foot soldiers to\r\na standstill. Fortunately the Duke had in hand a reserve of some\r\ntwenty battalions and many squadrons, all of whom had so recently\r\ncrossed the river that they had not yet come into action; and with\r\nthese troops he turned the right of the enemy’s line, drove in the\r\nouter flank of their infantry, and after dispersing a body of de\r\nVendôme’s cavalry fell upon the right rear of the French army. About\r\nthis time, but far too late to influence the issue of the battle,\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy ordered his left to move forward; but his foot\r\nsoldiers did nothing, and his horsemen were paralysed by the sight\r\nof the British regiments of cavalry, drawn up on the far side of the\r\nswamp across which they were called upon to advance. Thus the combat\r\nresolved itself into a struggle round the villages of Groenewald and\r\nDiepenbeck, and as night fell the flashes of the muskets showed that\r\nthe French line, ever growing thinner and narrower, was hour by hour\r\nmore closely hemmed in on front and flank and rear by Marlborough’s\r\ninfantry. Soon it became too dark to distinguish friend from foe,\r\nand after parties from the right and left wings of the Allies had met\r\nin rear of the French position and fired into each other, Marlborough\r\nordered his weary troops to break off the battle, to halt where\r\nthey stood, and be ready to resume the combat at dawn next day.\r\nBut at daybreak there was no enemy to fight. When the French right\r\nflank was turned the Duke of Burgundy again quarrelled fiercely\r\nwith de Vendôme. The General tried to keep the army together; the\r\nPrince insisted on an immediate retreat; the troops lost their\r\ndiscipline, and following the example of Louis XIV.’s grandson, a\r\nmass of runaways--generals and private soldiers, horse, foot and\r\nartillery--streamed off the field. Not all the French broke, however:\r\nby dint of de Vendôme’s personal exertions he rallied enough officers\r\nand men to form the rear-guard, with which he covered the “stampede”\r\nto Ghent.\r\n\r\nThe French lost about 6000 killed and wounded, and 9000\r\nprisoners;[50] and (according to Millner) we took from them 10 guns,\r\n56 pairs of colours, 52 standards, and 4500 horses. The casualties\r\namong the Allies were about 3000 killed or wounded, more than half\r\nof which were among the Dutch. The British suffered very little,\r\n53 officers and men being killed and 177 wounded. The Royal Irish,\r\nthough the first regiment to come in action, were extremely lucky\r\nin losing only a lieutenant and 8 private soldiers killed and 12\r\nwounded.[51]\r\n\r\nWhile Marlborough’s troops were enjoying forty-eight hours’\r\nwell-earned rest, an audacious project was forming itself in their\r\ngreat leader’s brain. He knew that an expedition was being prepared\r\nin England for a descent on the coast of Normandy, and that to meet\r\nit many battalions would be drawn off from the centre of France. The\r\nDuke of Burgundy’s army was reeling under the stroke of Oudenarde,\r\nand would take weeks to recover itself. Why should not the Allies\r\nprofit by this favourable combination of circumstances, and leaving\r\na detachment to watch the garrison of Lille, neglect that great\r\nfrontier fortress and carry the war into the very heart of France?\r\nBut the scheme was too daring, even for Eugene, who insisted that\r\nLille must be captured as a preliminary to a serious invasion. So the\r\nDuke made up his mind to reduce Lille, and marching across the French\r\nfrontier formed a camp near Commines, levying large contributions\r\nfrom the neighbouring towns, while he began his preparations for the\r\nsiege. A single detail will be enough to show how enormous these\r\npreparations were--the staff had to collect 16,000 horses to drag the\r\nbig guns and ammunition over the seventy-five miles of villanous road\r\nbetween Lille and Brussels, where the heavy ordnance was stored.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Duke of Berwick[52] with large reinforcements from\r\nthe Rhine raised the Duke of Burgundy’s strength to at least 100,000\r\ncombatants. To meet them Marlborough had only 84,000 troops; but\r\nwhen after many weeks’ delay his huge convoy started from Brussels,\r\nhe manœuvred so brilliantly that the enemy was never able to come\r\nwithin striking distance of its cumbrous length. It was not until\r\nthe 22nd of August that the Allies broke ground before Lille, which\r\nevery Frenchman regarded as impregnable, for on its fortification\r\nVauban had lavished all his skill, 150 guns and mortars frowned\r\nfrom its works, and Marshal de Boufflers commanded its garrison of\r\n15,000 picked men. The siege was to be carried on by Eugene, while\r\nfrom Helchin on the Scheldt Marlborough covered the operations with\r\nthe field army. Among Eugene’s troops the British were not strongly\r\nrepresented: “only five regiments were detailed for regular work in\r\nthe trenches”[53]--the 16th, 21st, 23rd, 24th, and as hard knocks\r\nwere to be expected, it is scarcely necessary to add, the XVIIIth\r\nalso. The Duke had hardly finished his lines of circumvallation, or,\r\nin modern language, the works protecting his own front and Eugene’s\r\nrear, when he learned that the Duke of Burgundy was advancing to\r\nthe relief of Lille. For a week the armies lay opposite each other.\r\nMarlborough and Eugene were anxious to attack the French, whose\r\nposition was so bad that Berwick saw nothing but defeat in store for\r\nthem if they gave battle; but once again the Dutch deputies threw\r\naway splendid chances by refusing to allow their troops to fight. The\r\nFrench generals, though under positive orders from Louis to wipe out\r\ntheir disgrace at Oudenarde by winning a great battle near Lille,\r\ndeclined the combat, and withdrew to devote themselves to the safer\r\ntask of harassing the Allies’ line of communication. By taking up\r\nand holding strongly positions running along the Scheldt and the\r\nScarpe from Ghent to Douai, they hoped to intercept all convoys from\r\nBrussels, at that time the Duke’s chief source of supply, but they\r\nforgot that in Ostend, which Marlborough had recaptured two years\r\nbefore, he possessed on the open sea a port within easy distance of\r\nEngland. The troops which had just returned from the expedition to\r\nNormandy--an expedition as futile as most of our similar enterprises\r\nseemed fated to be--were landed at Ostend, where they were employed\r\nmost usefully in forming a new base.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest in this part of the campaign is centred in\r\nMarlborough’s success in keeping the besiegers supplied with food and\r\nammunition, for the French could range at will over the greater part\r\nof the country between Ostend and Lille, and they had possession\r\nof the sluices that could inundate the districts through which the\r\nconvoys had to pass. After the brilliant little fight at Wynendal,\r\nwhere a valuable convoy fought its way through a very superior force,\r\nde Vendôme laid the neighbourhood of Ostend under water; but the Duke\r\norganised a service of punts in which, despite the attentions of\r\nFrench gunboats, stores were transported over the deepest part of the\r\nflood, and then transferred to vehicles fitted with very high wheels\r\nto keep their loads above the level of the water.[54]\r\n\r\nThe strain upon the Commander-in-Chief at this time must have been\r\nindescribable, for in addition to the constant anxiety about his\r\ncommissariat, things did not always go well at Lille, where de\r\nBoufflers defended himself in a masterly manner: Eugene was so badly\r\nwounded that for some weeks he could not direct the operations: the\r\nengineers made mistakes, and the supply of ammunition was always\r\nscanty. When to these troubles was added the arrival from the Rhine\r\nof a large body of the enemy under the Elector of Bavaria, who\r\nlaid vigorous siege to Brussels, the nerves of most men would have\r\nsuffered; but with unbroken serenity Marlborough prepared to rescue\r\nBrussels from the danger threatening it. After misleading the French\r\nby false reports about his movements, he burst through their line of\r\ndefences on the Scheldt, and so alarmed the Elector that he hurriedly\r\ndecamped, leaving behind him his sick, his wounded, and his guns.\r\n\r\nThe details of the doings of the XVIIIth in the siege of Lille\r\nare very scanty; but it is known that in a great, though not very\r\nsuccessful assault on September 7, when Eugene lost about 3000 men,\r\nhis five British regiments between them had 350 casualties, or from\r\na fifth to a sixth of their whole strength.[55] In a desperate\r\nattack on the counterscarp a fortnight later, Eugene was followed\r\nby a number of British troops, among whom were some regiments lent\r\nfor the occasion by the covering army. In his memoirs he relates\r\nthat after two assaults had been repulsed with great slaughter, he\r\nspoke a few words in English to the brave fellows who rallied round\r\nhim, and then led them back to the fire, where a musket-ball knocked\r\nhim senseless. The men thought he was dead; but an intelligent\r\nsoldier remembered that he was a great friend of the Duke’s, and\r\nafter looking for some conveyance on which to transport him to his\r\nquarters, carried him back on a dung cart! On the 9th of December de\r\nBoufflers surrendered on excellent terms, granted him as a proof of\r\nMarlborough’s admiration for his splendid defence, which had cost\r\nFrance 8000 men, and the Allies about 14,000 in killed and wounded\r\nalone. The returns of the British losses are incomplete: Millner\r\nstates that from the beginning of the siege to October 22, when the\r\nFrench abandoned the town and retreated in the citadel, the five\r\nBritish regiments in Eugene’s force lost 1600 officers and men; the\r\ncasualties for the remainder of the siege he was unable to obtain.\r\nStearne briefly dismisses the services of the XVIIIth at Lille in\r\nthe following words: “Our regiment suffered very much, having two\r\ncaptains and three subalterns killed: our major, with several other\r\nofficers wounded, and upwards of 200 men killed and wounded.”[56]\r\n\r\nIt would be deeply interesting to know how many of the Royal Irish\r\nwho watched the garrison of Lille march out with all the honours\r\nof war had seen the ceremonial at Namur thirteen years before.\r\nUnfortunately it occurred to none of the literary officers of\r\nthe XVIIIth to record the numbers. The mental attitude of these\r\nold warriors is very curious: they seem to have grown tired of\r\nwriting about battles and sieges, and as the war went on cut their\r\ndescriptions shorter and shorter, though they were ready to dilate on\r\nany departure from the usual routine of warfare. Thus, for example,\r\nthey all give accounts of a daring attempt to throw reinforcements\r\nof powder into Lille. Two thousand cavalrymen started from Douai,\r\ncarrying large bags of powder behind them, and wearing in their hats\r\n“boughs of trees,” in imitation of the Germans who always decorated\r\nthemselves in this way when on an expedition--or as the British\r\nsoldier would now express it, “when on the job.” In the dusk they\r\nrode up to the outer barrier of the line of circumvallation, gave\r\nover the pass-word, and stating they were a detachment of German\r\nHorse with prisoners, were allowed to enter. Then they rode on\r\nundetected, until one of the party, to use modern slang, “gave the\r\nshow away,” by remarking in French to a comrade that they had got\r\nthrough the barrier very easily. A watchful sentry overheard him,\r\ndrew his own conclusions, and by promptly firing at the speaker gave\r\nthe alarm. The troops, says Millner,\r\n\r\n  “instantly turned out of their Tents in only their Shirts and\r\n  Cartridge Boxes with their Ammunition, and seiz’d their Arms from\r\n  their Belts, and in a Trice form’d themselves into as good Order\r\n  as could be expected, and with undaunted Courage, though in the\r\n  Dark, fired amongst the thickest of the Enemy putting them in\r\n  great Disorder and Confusion, so that in the Hurly-Burly thereof,\r\n  several of the Bags of Powder fell off on a Causeway, and was\r\n  broke; the which by the prancing of the Horses’ Feet, took Fire,\r\n  and thereby blowed up and tore to pieces upwards of one Hundred\r\n  Men of them, and likewise destroyed a good many of their Horses;\r\n  but in the interim thereof, a few of them slipt into the City\r\n  with some Ammunition also; but the major Part was obliged to\r\n  retire, and that in very great Haste, Disorder and Confusion\r\n  back again to Tournai.... The Besieged made a great Huzzaing\r\n  that Night because they had got those few in with some Relief of\r\n  Powder.”\r\n\r\nWhile de Boufflers was discussing with Marlborough the terms of\r\ncapitulation, the other French Generals, thinking that the Duke was\r\nas much worn out by the campaign as they were themselves, sent their\r\nmen into winter quarters and went off to Paris. But they reckoned\r\nwithout their host. Marlborough sprang at Ghent, and invested it,\r\nrepulsed a great sortie on Christmas Day, and accepted the surrender\r\nof the garrison on January 2, 1709. The French troops in Bruges did\r\nnot wait to be attacked, but abandoned the town and citadel: and\r\nthen, but not till then, the Allies were allowed to disperse to their\r\nwinter quarters.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the year 1708 the regiment was deprived\r\nof the services of the adjutant, Captain Robert Parker, who was\r\nspecially selected to act as instructor in discipline and drill to\r\nthe regiments at that time quartered in Ireland. To any officer\r\nthe compliment would have been great; but in Parker’s case it was\r\nespecially flattering, because he was a self-made man who had risen\r\nfrom the ranks. His story is an interesting one. His father was\r\na farmer near Kilkenny, where the boy was sent to a school which\r\nboasted of a company of cadets (as we should now call them), who\r\nwere “armed with wooden guns and took great delight in marching and\r\nexercising.” These cadets must have been a remarkable set of lads, as\r\nmore than thirty of them obtained commissions, and some indeed became\r\nGeneral officers. Parker soon discovered that soldiering was the\r\ntrade for him, and running away from home, enlisted in an independent\r\ncompany commanded by Captain Frederick Hamilton, the future Colonel\r\nof the XVIIIth Regiment. During the Tyrconnel troubles both\r\nHamilton and Parker were disbanded, but April, 1689, found them in\r\nMeath’s regiment, the one a major, the other a full private. Parker\r\njoined with a strong determination to get on in his profession. “I\r\ndetermined to be very circumspect in my behaviour, by which I gained\r\nthe esteem of my Major and most of the officers of the regiment. I\r\napplied myself diligently to the use of arms, and soon became expert\r\nin it.” Whether he had risen to be a sergeant in the Irish wars is\r\nnot known: all he tells us about himself at that time is that at\r\nAthlone in throwing up an entrenchment he “received a favourable shot\r\non the crown of the head; the ball only grazed on a good thick skull\r\nand went off”; and that at the end of the siege he was much injured\r\nby a stone dropped on him by the defenders of the castle. He must\r\nhave been a non-commissioned officer in 1695; desperately wounded\r\nat Namur, he found when he returned to duty after seven months in\r\nhospital, that he had been gazetted to a commission, with seven\r\nensigns junior to him. Eleven years later he was Captain-Lieutenant\r\nand Adjutant, and after receiving at Menin “a contusion on the side\r\nof the head which was likely to be fatal,” was promoted to be captain\r\nof the grenadier company. Parker was so successful in disciplining\r\nthe infantry in Ireland that, when after two years he returned to\r\nduty with the regiment in Flanders, Government made him a present of\r\ntwo hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThough Louis had suffered heavily in 1708, the enormous resources of\r\nhis kingdom enabled him to send large numbers of fresh troops to\r\nthe Marshal de Villars, whom early in 1709 he placed in command of\r\nthe army of Flanders. De Villars’ first care had been to secure the\r\nsafety of Arras, the key to the north-east of France, by throwing up\r\nto the east of the town a great line of works which stretched from\r\nthe Lys to Douai; and from behind these works, known as the lines\r\nof La Bassée, he watched the Allies, who owing to the lateness of\r\nthe season did not take the field till June. Marlborough’s first\r\nmove was to make open, even ostentatious preparations to force\r\nthe lines; de Villars concentrated to resist them, calling up as\r\nreinforcements a large portion of the garrison of Tournai, a fortress\r\nsome sixteen miles east of Lille. As Tournai was Marlborough’s\r\nimmediate objective, he marched swiftly upon it, and invested it\r\nbefore de Villars discovered how completely he had been outwitted. At\r\nthe beginning of the siege the XVIIIth took part in an expedition to\r\nreduce various small forts in the neighbourhood, and after marching\r\nnight and day returned “greatly fatigued,”[57] but in time to help to\r\nstorm the breaches of the ravelin, and to repulse a determined sortie\r\nby the garrison, who strove to make up for the weakness of their\r\nnumbers by the vigour of their defence. Up to the time that the town\r\nsurrendered and the troops retired into the citadel, the siege had\r\nrun on normal lines; but when the attack on the citadel began things\r\nbecame very different, for this stronghold was celebrated throughout\r\nEurope for its subterranean defences, and the ground outside its\r\nwalls was honeycombed with casemates, mines, and secret passages. To\r\nreach these hidden works the besiegers had to sink deep shafts, and\r\nthen to drive tunnels fathoms deep under the earth, at any moment\r\nliable to be blown sky-high by the explosion of a mine. The desperate\r\nwork done by the XVIIIth in this phase of the siege is well described\r\nby Stearne.\r\n\r\n  “The enemy and we met several times underground and fought it out\r\n  with bayonet and pistol, and in twelve days the French sprang\r\n  sixteen mines, which blew up a great many of our men; and one\r\n  mine did so much execution that it blew up part of the town wall,\r\n  two branches of our trenches with a parallel between them, and\r\n  ruined two of our mines, with a Captain and Lieutenant of our\r\n  regiment and another officer and forty men, all of which happened\r\n  on our attack.... Our miners discovered the branches of another\r\n  mine, and as they were busy in finding out the mine itself, they\r\n  heard the enemy at work in one of their galleries, whereupon\r\n  a Lieutenant and twenty Grenadiers were ordered to dislodge\r\n  them, but the Lieutenant being killed at the first onset the\r\n  Grenadiers retired immediately; after that another officer with\r\n  a fresh detachment was ordered for that service, but the enemy\r\n  throwing a great many grenades and making a great smoke with\r\n  combustible stuff, forced them to retire being suffocated. The\r\n  next day, the miners being supported by a Lieutenant and sixteen\r\n  Grenadiers, were at work, to pierce through a gallery they had\r\n  discovered, but upon their breaking into it, the enemy threw\r\n  in upon them a great quantity of straw, hemp, powder and other\r\n  combustible matter, and being set on fire the Lieutenant and\r\n  ten of the Grenadiers were stifled. After this manner was this\r\n  terrible siege carried on, till by degrees we wrought ourselves\r\n  almost into the ditch. The enemy sprang a mine which was their\r\n  last effort, with which we had near four hundred men killed, but\r\n  notwithstanding we lodged ourselves that night on our attack near\r\n  their palisades, where we raised a prodigious quantity of cannon.”\r\n\r\nThe citadel capitulated on the 3rd of September, after more than\r\n3000 French officers and men had fallen. The besiegers’ casualties\r\nare given in Millner’s return as 1233 killed, 4055 wounded, or a\r\ngrand total of 5288. Millner is not as clear as usual about the loss\r\nof the British, but it seems probable that 178 were killed and 521\r\nwounded, or 699 of all ranks. To what extent the Royal Irish suffered\r\nit is impossible to say, but it is probable that in such continuous\r\nfighting more officers and men were placed _hors de combat_ than are\r\nmentioned in Stearne’s narrative.[58]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Marlborough saw that the defence of Tournai was weakening,\r\nhe marched a large force towards the lines of La Bassée; again\r\ndemonstrated against de Villars, whom he puzzled completely, and\r\nthen, after a march of forty-nine miles in fifty-six hours, in\r\npouring rain over roads knee-deep in mud, swooped upon Mons, a town\r\nimportant to the French, though at that time only weakly held. When\r\nde Villars slowly realised that the Duke had no intention of wasting\r\nhis strength in storming highly fortified lines, he advanced with\r\n95,000 men, and entrenched himself at the Trouée d’Aulnoit, one of\r\nthe few gaps in a belt of woodland which lay a few miles to the south\r\nof Mons. He outnumbered the Allies so greatly that they decided\r\nnot to attack him until the troops left to level the siege-works\r\nat Tournai had rejoined headquarters, and thus made Marlborough’s\r\nnumerical strength equal to that of his opponent. These troops, among\r\nwhich were the XVIIIth and several other British regiments, were\r\nordered up at once, but while they were on the march de Villars,\r\nby working night and day, rendered his position very formidable.\r\nHis right rested on the forest of Laignières, half a mile from the\r\nvillage of Malplaquet,[59] which has given its name to the battle\r\nof the 11th of September, 1709: his centre ran across the southern\r\nend of the gap, which was open, fairly level, and about 2000 yards\r\nin width: his left was thrown forward into the continuous series of\r\nwoods known respectively as those of Taignières, Blangies, and Sart.\r\nAcross his centre he built long lines of trenches, gun emplacements,\r\nchains of abattis, and many strong redans; the woods on his flanks\r\nwere similarly protected, and when the attackers had forced their way\r\nthrough the abattis which fringed the edges they came under the fire\r\nof field-works hidden in the depths of the forest. The weak point\r\nof the position was that cavalry could only act offensively on the\r\nplain--_i.e._, the gap between the woods; and as this open ground was\r\ncovered with defences Villars had to draw up his Horse in rear of the\r\nrest of his troops, where they would be unable to come into action\r\nunless the Allies broke through some part of the front line.\r\n\r\nFor the attack of this position, which from the nature of its\r\nfortifications had virtually become a fortress, the Duke issued the\r\nfollowing orders: The Prince of Orange with thirty-one battalions,\r\nmost of which were Dutch, was to make a demonstration against the\r\nright of the French line; sixty-eight battalions were to assail the\r\nnorthern and eastern faces of the woods of Taignières and Sart; while\r\nGeneral Withers, with five British and fourteen foreign battalions,\r\nwas to strike and turn the extreme left of the enemy’s line at the\r\nvillage of La Folie. As the pressure on the French left became\r\nintense, the Duke expected (as did actually happen) that de Villars\r\nwould draw largely from his centre to reinforce the point of danger;\r\nthen fifteen British battalions and other infantry, till then held\r\nback in the centre, were to be launched at the works in the gap,\r\ncapture them, and thus win a passage for the allied cavalry, which\r\nwas then to crash through Villars’ centre and cut his army in twain.\r\nThe heavier guns were massed into two great batteries--one playing on\r\nthe enemy’s right, the other on his left.\r\n\r\nThough the advanced parties of the hostile armies watched each other\r\nthroughout the night at little more than a musket’s shot distance,\r\nnothing happened to disturb the few hours’ rest which the Duke\r\nallowed his men.[60] Long before daylight the troops were under arms,\r\nand when morning service had been read at the head of every regiment,\r\nthe Duke rode through his army, correcting faulty dispositions and\r\nsending to their places in the line of battle the horse and dragoons\r\nwho during the night had arrived from Tournai. They had left behind\r\nthem on the road the infantry, who came on as best they could, the\r\nlast to reach the battlefield being the Royal Irish, whose march\r\nwas retarded by the slow-moving guns they had to escort.[61] After\r\nan hour’s artillery duel Marlborough began to carry his plan into\r\neffect, and launched his infantry columns against Villars’ flanks. At\r\nfirst things went well. His right made some progress, though in the\r\nwoods of Taignières and Sart the French fought superbly, disputing\r\nevery inch of ground, and by vigorous counter-attacks often sending\r\ntheir assailants reeling back upon their supports; and on his\r\nleft the Prince of Orange kept the enemy occupied in the forest of\r\nLaignières by his feigned attack. Suddenly, in direct defiance of\r\nhis orders from the Duke, this General took upon himself to attack\r\nin real earnest; but the French fell upon his column with such\r\nresistless energy that the Dutch, stubborn fighters as they were,\r\nwere driven back with hideous slaughter. Marlborough received this\r\nstartling news with composure; he directed the Prince of Orange to\r\ncontent himself with holding the French without again attacking them;\r\nand confident of ultimate success, in no way altered his original\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nWhile the Prince of Orange was being buffeted on the left, Eugene,\r\nwho commanded on the right flank, was forcing the French backwards\r\nthrough the woods. The process, though slow and very costly, was\r\nsure; and when de Villars, who had taken charge of the French left,\r\nheard that the red-coats of Withers’ column were appearing on his\r\nflank at La Folie, he did exactly what Marlborough expected him to\r\ndo, and weakened his centre to reinforce his left. Three brigades,\r\none of them composed of the Irishmen who had done so well at\r\nBlenheim, hurried up to de Villars’ help, plunged into the wood, and\r\ndrove the Allies back on their supports. In this charge the Irish\r\nBrigade with reckless valour pursued so far that they lost their\r\nformation, and the whole or part of one of its battalions found\r\nitself alone in a glade, where it was attacked by the Royal Irish.\r\nThe XVIIIth had come so late into action that it had been sent off to\r\nthe extreme right of the whole army, where, in modern phraseology, it\r\nseems to have acted “on its own,” and according to Parker marched on\r\ntill it came\r\n\r\n  “to an open in the wood. It was a small plain, on the opposite\r\n  side of which we perceived a battalion of the enemy drawn up.\r\n  Upon this Colonel Kane who was then at the head of the regiment,\r\n  having drawn us up and formed our Platoons, advanced gently\r\n  towards them, and the six Platoons of our first fire made ready.\r\n  When we had advanced within a hundred yards of them, they gave us\r\n  a fire of one of their ranks, whereupon we halted, and returned\r\n  them the fire of our six Platoons at once; and immediately made\r\n  ready the six Platoons of our second fire, and advanced upon\r\n  them again. They then gave us the fire of another rank, and we\r\n  returned them a second fire, which made them shrink; however they\r\n  gave us the fire of a third rank after a scattering manner, and\r\n  then retired into the wood in great disorder, on which we sent\r\n  our third fire after them, and saw them no more. We advanced\r\n  cautiously up to the ground which they had quitted and found\r\n  several of them, killed and wounded; among the latter was one\r\n  Lieutenant O’Sullivan, who told us the battalion we had engaged\r\n  was the Royal Regiment of Ireland in the French service.”\r\n\r\nIn this skirmish the XVIIIth, or Royal regiment of Foot of Ireland,\r\nhad but few casualties; while the Iro-Gallic regiment, as “their\r\nopposite number” in Louis’ army was termed, is said to have lost\r\nseveral officers and about forty men.[62]\r\n\r\nWhile the Irishmen were settling their quarrel, the climax of the\r\nbattle was approaching. Eugene had rallied his infantry in the wood\r\nof Taignières, and was struggling to hold his own against the fresh\r\ntroops which de Villars in person led against him. Both generals\r\nwere wounded--Eugene was struck on the head by a musket-ball, but\r\nrefused to leave the fighting line to have his injury attended\r\nto by a surgeon; de Villars, hard hit in the leg, made a gallant\r\neffort to direct the battle from a chair, but swooning from pain\r\nwas carried away insensible to the nearest village. Though deprived\r\nof their leader, the French fought obstinately, and on the right\r\nof the allied line the combat raged without any decisive result,\r\nneither side knowing that when the three brigades were moved from\r\nthe centre to the left of de Villars’ line, Marlborough had ordered\r\nthe Dutch forward on his left, and had hurled himself against the\r\nheart of the French position. Orkney’s fifteen battalions of British\r\ninfantry, who for many hours had been waiting for their chance,\r\nwere let loose against the redans across their front, and carrying\r\nthem after a sharp fight, promptly lined with marksmen the reverse\r\nparapets--_i.e._, those looking backwards into the enemy’s second\r\nline. On the left, the Dutch infantry atoned for their mistake in\r\nthe morning by capturing not only the wood of Laignières, but the\r\nabattis and trenches connecting it with the works now in the hands\r\nof the red-coated battalions, and the Dutch cavalry poured through\r\nthe openings won by their infantry comrades. But in the scramble\r\nover shelter trenches and abattis their ranks became disordered,\r\nand before they had time to re-form they were attacked by the\r\nGendarmerie, and forced to take shelter under the muskets of Orkney’s\r\nbattalions, whose steady shooting beat off the French and gained\r\ntime for Marlborough to come up with the British and Prussian horse.\r\nThese were driving the Gendarmerie backwards, when a splendid\r\ncounter-attack of the French Household troops crashed through\r\ntheir first line, penetrated the second, and threw the third into\r\nconfusion. At that moment Eugene, dashing up bloodstained from his\r\nwound, threw his last squadrons against the enemy’s flank; Louis’\r\nBodyguard wavered and gave way, and de Boufflers, on whom the command\r\nhad devolved after de Villars was wounded, seeing that his centre was\r\npierced, his right dislodged, and his left beaten though not routed,\r\nordered a retreat.\r\n\r\nHis retirement was quite unmolested by the Allies, who were too much\r\nexhausted to pursue an enemy who after such a desperate struggle\r\nwas still able to retire in good order. Marlborough had begun\r\nthe engagement with about 95,000 troops, but by three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon twenty thousand of his men were killed or wounded.\r\nMillner’s analysis of the casualties shows that the Germans lost 5321\r\nofficers and men; the Prussians, 1694; the Hanoverians, 2219; the\r\nDutch (thanks to the Prince of Orange’s untimely movement), 8680; and\r\nthe British, 1783. In the British contingent 32 officers were killed\r\nand 111 wounded; among the other ranks, 492 were killed and 1073\r\nwounded. Of the XVIIIth, two officers were wounded, four men killed\r\nand six wounded.[63] Though the French lost the day, only twelve\r\nthousand of their men fell; and the only trophies of the victory left\r\nin the hands of the Allies were sixteen guns, five hundred prisoners,\r\nand many standards.\r\n\r\nThree days after the battle the Duke resumed the siege of Mons, where\r\nthe Royal Irish were among the regiments of the covering force, and\r\nwhen the fall of the fortress brought the campaign to an end, the\r\nXVIIIth returned to its usual winter quarters in the town of Ghent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 1.\r\n\r\n  OUDENARDE\r\n  July 11, 1708\r\n\r\n  BLENHEIM\r\n  August 13, 1704\r\n\r\n  RAMILLES\r\n  May 23, 1706\r\n\r\n  MALPLAQUET\r\n  Sept. 11, 1709\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nThough no great battle occurred in 1710, the army in Flanders was\r\nby no means idle. As Marlborough failed to induce Villars to try\r\nconclusions with him in the field, he began to prepare for a future\r\ninvasion of France by the successive capture of the fortresses of\r\nDouai, St Venant, Bethune, and Aire. The XVIIIth was in the besieging\r\nforce at Aire, where the small garrison defended itself gallantly for\r\nnearly ten weeks, not surrendering until it had lost about 1400 men\r\nand inflicted nearly five times as many casualties on the attackers.\r\nNothing is known of the work done in this siege by the XVIIIth;\r\nStearne and Parker contented themselves with recording that owing to\r\nthe capture of a convoy food was very scarce in camp,[64] and that\r\nthe regiment had three officers killed and five wounded, with\r\nabout eighty casualties among the other ranks.[65]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1710-11 the French made gigantic efforts to\r\nprotect their country against the threatened invasion, and threw up\r\nfresh lines, which ran from Namur to a point on the English Channel\r\na few miles south of Boulogne, using rivers and canals, swamps, and\r\nartificial inundations as barriers against the general whom they\r\nfeared so greatly. Before Marlborough was ready to open the campaign\r\nof 1711, his trusted friend and invaluable colleague, Prince Eugene,\r\nwas recalled to Austria with a large body of troops, but though left\r\nwith forces greatly inferior in numbers to those of de Villars, he\r\nresolved to carry out the first task he had already set himself,\r\nthe capture of Bouchain. As this fortress was protected by the new\r\nlines, which were far too strong to be carried by force, the Duke\r\ndetermined to decoy Marshal de Villars from the opening in the works\r\nat Arleux, where he intended to cross. He advanced and retired;\r\nthreatened first one part of the lines and then another; issued\r\ncontradictory orders; pretended to be cast down at the loss of a weak\r\ndetachment intentionally thrown away as a bait to his adversary;\r\nsimulated alternately rage, dejection, rashness; and deceived not\r\nonly the French spies in his camp, but also his own army, who began\r\nto fear that their beloved “Corporal John” had lost his judgment. By\r\nacting apparently like a madman, but really with the profound skill\r\nof a great master of war, he lured de Villars forty miles to the\r\nwestward of Arleux, and on the morning of August 4, ostentatiously\r\nreconnoitred the Marshal’s position, explaining in unusual detail to\r\nthe generals who accompanied him the part each was to play in the\r\nassault which was to be delivered on the morrow: then he returned to\r\ncamp and issued orders for the coming battle. At tattoo the word was\r\npassed to strike tents and fall in at once, and in an hour the troops\r\nwere in motion. At first they thought they were merely taking up\r\nground for the attack next day, but when hour after hour they plodded\r\nsteadily eastward, they were fairly puzzled until, just before dawn,\r\nthe message ran down the column: “The cavalry have reached Arleux\r\nand have passed the lines, and the Duke desires that the infantry\r\nwill step out.” And step out they did! They forgot the fatigue of the\r\nfifteen miles they had marched already with heavy muskets on their\r\nshoulders and fifty pounds’ weight upon their backs, and without a\r\nhalt for rest or food trudged manfully over an apparently endless\r\nplain. When the sun grew hot the work began to tell, and it became\r\na question of the survival of the fittest. The weaker men dropped\r\nexhausted on the ground, first by scores, then by hundreds, and later\r\nin the day literally by thousands; but without stopping to help their\r\ncomrades, those soldiers who still had the strength to keep their\r\nplaces in the ranks set their teeth and staggered on, determined not\r\nto be beaten in the race by the French, whose horsemen they could\r\nsee on the other side of the lines hurrying in the same direction as\r\nthemselves. Early in the afternoon the leading battalions reached\r\nArleux and reinforced the cavalry, who were already in possession\r\nof the entrance to the works. The XVIIIth came up about 4 P.M.;\r\napparently the discipline and the marching powers of the regiment\r\nhad brought it there fairly intact, but when the men realised that\r\nthe prize was won and Arleux safe in the Duke’s hands, the reaction,\r\ninevitable after so prolonged a strain, set in, and half of the Royal\r\nIrish collapsed, dead beat and unable to walk another yard. Barely\r\nfifty per cent of the infantry had kept up with the army in this\r\nforced march, when nearly forty miles was covered in eighteen hours.\r\nNumbers of men were found dead from exhaustion, and it was fully\r\nthree days before all the stragglers had rejoined the Colours.\r\n\r\nMarlborough now laid siege to Bouchain, and handled the covering\r\nforce so well against de Villars’ superior numbers that the French\r\nfailed to interfere with his operations, and on the 13th of September\r\nhad the mortification of seeing the garrison surrender. The investing\r\nforce was desperately hard worked during the siege. For thirteen days\r\nconsecutively the Royal Irish marched and dug trenches all day, and\r\nat night stood to their arms, ready to fight at any moment. “This,”\r\nsays Parker, “was the greatest fatigue I ever underwent at any one\r\ntime of my life.” Though the French surrendered before the breach\r\nwas stormed, they inflicted heavy losses on the besiegers, whose\r\ncasualties amounted to 4018, of which 1154 were among the fifteen\r\nBritish battalions employed in the siege. The Royal Irish were\r\nfortunate: only four officers were wounded, and about forty of the\r\nother ranks killed or wounded.[66] It is said that an officer of the\r\nXVIIIth, whose courage was as high as his stature was low, was nearly\r\ndrowned in wading across a deep inundation, so he had himself hoisted\r\non the shoulders of the biggest of the grenadiers of his party, and\r\nwhen safely landed at the foot of the parapet led an assault upon the\r\nenemy’s works.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Bouchain was the last service the Duke of Marlborough\r\nwas allowed to render to his country. Political intrigues had long\r\nbeen directed against him, and when he returned to England in the\r\nautumn he was coldly received by Queen Anne, insulted in the House\r\nof Lords, prosecuted for peculation by the House of Commons, and\r\ndeprived of all his offices. Nay, more, to such a height did party\r\npamphleteers rouse popular indignation against him, that the General\r\n“who never fought a battle that he did not gain nor sat down before\r\na fortress he did not take” was forced to go to the Continent to\r\nescape from the jeers of the London mob. Even before his fall, the\r\nMinisters in power had begun secret negotiations with Louis, by which\r\nEngland was to desert her Allies and make a separate peace with\r\nFrance; and when the Duke of Ormond, his successor in command of the\r\nBritish forces in Flanders, joined the army in the spring of 1712, he\r\nunderstood that he was on no account to cross swords with de Villars.\r\nDuring several months the British troops were in a very miserable\r\nposition; for being still, at least in name, part of the allied\r\narmy, to the supreme command of which Eugene had now succeeded, they\r\nfollowed its operations, but in a novel and humiliating capacity:\r\nthey were no longer chief actors, but spectators--soldiers whom their\r\nGovernment would not allow to fight; and when Ormond announced to\r\nthem that the suspension of hostilities between England and France\r\nwas signed, the news filled them with profound grief. In July they\r\nturned their backs upon their former comrades and returned to Ghent\r\nand Bruges, after a gloomy march past Douai, Tournai, Bouchain,\r\nLille, and Oudenarde, places which they had helped to take, but to\r\nwhich the Dutch garrisons now contemptuously refused them admittance.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty years of almost uninterrupted fighting, every army\r\nrequires careful handling at the beginning of peace, but more\r\nespecially one sore at the ill-treatment of its beloved Chief, sorer\r\nstill at the loss of its honour by its desertion of its comrades in\r\nthe time of need. Ormond did not manage his men well, and neglected\r\ntheir commissariat; the garrison of Ghent lost their discipline,\r\nlistened to the words of agitators, and formed a mad scheme to rise;\r\nloot and burn the town, and then disperse over the Netherlands. The\r\nplot was discovered, but two or three thousand men seized part of the\r\ntown, where they barricaded themselves, holding out until field-guns\r\nwere brought against them. Soon after this mutiny was put down the\r\ntroops were withdrawn to England, but the Royal Irish and another\r\nregiment were left to garrison the town until political questions\r\nregarding it had been settled. Their detention at Ghent gave them the\r\nopportunity to see Marlborough once more, for when he passed through\r\nthe town at the end of 1712 the whole garrison was on foot to do him\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nTo many of the officers and men of the XVIIIth Ghent must have been\r\nmore familiar than their own homes in Ireland, for they had wintered\r\nthere for many years during the war, and did not finally leave it\r\nuntil the autumn of 1715, when the regiment returned to England. A\r\nfew months later it was quartered at Oxford, where “the scholars\r\nand the soldiers did not agree,” until the officers ordered their\r\nmen to leave their weapons behind them when they went out at night,\r\ntaking instead stout cudgels with which to teach the undergraduates\r\ngood manners. This stopped the trouble, and all was quiet until, on\r\nthe Prince of Wales’ birthday, the officers lit a bonfire outside\r\nthe Post Office, and then went to supper. While they were at table\r\nstones began to come in through the window; a number of soldiers\r\nrushed to the defence of their officers, and broke the windows of\r\nthe house from which the supper party had been pelted. Then arose\r\na furious row: the townsmen turned out; so did the soldiers from\r\ntheir quarters, and headed by a Lieutenant of grenadiers, who “was\r\na little elevated,” a mass of Royal Irishmen went through the town\r\nbreaking every window they could reach that was not illuminated in\r\nhonour of the Royal birthday. Patrols were sent out to stop the\r\nwindow-breaking, but it is possible they were not very zealous--at\r\nany rate, much damage was done before the rioting was stopped. The\r\nDons announced that they would have every officer in the regiment\r\ncashiered for this insult to the University, and solemnly complained\r\nto the Privy Council, who at once asked for “reasons in writing,”\r\nor their equivalent at the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\nThen the House of Lords debated the matter at great length, and\r\nfinally decided in favour of the officers, charging the University\r\nwith disloyalty for not celebrating properly the Prince of Wales’\r\nbirthday. Thus the affair ended without detriment to the regiment,\r\nand to the great benefit of the Oxford glaziers who had to replace\r\n£500 worth of broken glass.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1712, Lieutenant-General Ingoldsby died.\r\nBrigadier-General Richard Stearne, his successor, made over the\r\nregiment in 1717 to Colonel William Cosby.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1718-1793.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR--THE SIEGE OF\r\nOSTEND--LEXINGTON--BUNKER’S HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than three years after the Royal Irish returned from the Low\r\nCountries they found themselves again on foreign service, this time\r\nin the south of Europe. During the war of the Spanish Succession\r\nthere had been much fighting in the Mediterranean, where Gibraltar,\r\nand Port Mahon in Minorca, one of the Balearic Islands, had been\r\ncaptured by England, whose possession of these two fortresses was\r\nconfirmed by the Peace of Utrecht. When this peace was signed every\r\nnation hoped that for many years there would be no more wars on the\r\nContinent; but very soon relations between Spain and Austria became\r\nso strained that the British Government decided to send a squadron to\r\nthe Mediterranean, to support Austria if Spain attacked her Italian\r\npossessions, and to reinforce the garrison of Minorca. Among these\r\nreinforcements were the Royal Irish, who, less fortunate than some of\r\nthe regiments in Minorca, were not selected to serve as marines in\r\nour short but successful campaign off the coast of Sicily.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, the little world of Port Mahon was startled by grave news\r\nfrom the mainland. Spain still smarted under the loss of Gibraltar:\r\nevery Spaniard looked upon the presence of the red-coats on the Rock\r\nas an affront not only to his nation but to himself, and was prepared\r\nto risk much to recover the fortress. For the second time since the\r\nXVIIIth had been quartered in Minorca, Spain, regardless of the fact\r\nthat she was not at war with England, was making preparations to\r\nrecapture Gibraltar. On the first occasion, in 1720, though peace\r\nhad been restored between the Courts of Madrid and of St James, the\r\nSpaniards, under the pretext of reinforcing their garrison at Ceuta,\r\nassembled a large number of troops near the fortress, laid violent\r\nhands upon a hundred British merchant ships then lying in the ports\r\nof southern Spain, and forced their crews to carry warlike stores to\r\nthe bay of Algeçiras. Gibraltar at that moment was in a deplorable\r\ncondition--the regiments were weak; there were only two officers\r\nof field rank in the garrison, as the seniors were at home, many of\r\nthem without leave; the guns were few in number and bad in quality,\r\nand there was only fourteen days’ supply of food in store. The place\r\nwas in such imminent danger that Colonel Kane, then Governor of\r\nMinorca, was ordered to come to the rescue with every man who could\r\nbe spared from his command. When he and his reinforcement of five\r\nhundred men[68] arrived off the Rock, he found it threatened by three\r\nhundred Spanish transports, escorted by six galleys, each manned\r\nby 500 slaves, and three 60-gun Maltese war vessels, hired to take\r\npart in the attack. The appearance of the four or five men-of-war\r\nwith the Minorca contingent frightened away the Maltese, and the\r\nSpaniards returned to Ceuta without firing a shot. Now, seven years\r\nlater, great preparations for war were again on foot--a fleet of\r\ntrading vessels was employed in transporting guns, ammunition, and\r\nstores from Cadiz to Algeçiras, where as many as forty ships arrived\r\nin a day; large numbers of troops were assembled, and the peasants\r\nof Southern Andalusia were swept together to serve as labourers in\r\nthe siege. Our Government, however, was under the impression that\r\nthe Spaniards meditated not a siege but a _coup de main_, and in\r\nDecember, 1726, warned the authorities at Gibraltar to be prepared\r\nfor “a sudden push on the sea line by scaling ladders, encouraged by\r\nthe weakness of the garrison.” The bearer of this important message\r\nwas not sent from England by a swift frigate, but was left to make\r\nhis way to Spain as best he could; landing at Malaga, he chartered a\r\nship to take him to Gibraltar, but was captured on the voyage by a\r\nSpanish man-of-war and thrown into prison. The despatches, however,\r\nwere saved and duly reached their destination; Kane was once more\r\nsummoned from Minorca, and with a regiment on the point of returning\r\nto England reached Gibraltar in February, 1727. Doubtless the XVIIIth\r\nwas deeply disgusted at being left behind, but in a few weeks came\r\nthe turn, not indeed of the whole regiment, but of a portion of it,\r\nto share in the honours of the defence.\r\n\r\nAccording to the memoirs of Marshal Keith, a Scottish soldier of\r\nfortune, who before he rose to eminence in the service of Russia\r\nheld a commission in the Spanish army, Kane did not arrive a moment\r\ntoo soon, for there was but a slender guard at the landward gate,\r\nand the Spanish soldiers were allowed to come into the town without\r\nbeing searched for arms. A surprise would have been easy, but the\r\nfortress was saved by a strange exhibition of pride. Count de las\r\nTorres, who commanded the Spaniards, haughtily said that “would\r\nthe English give him the town, he would not enter it but by the\r\nbreach.” In the middle of February his troops, 20,000 strong, took up\r\npositions at San Roque, and in order to provoke hostilities began to\r\nthrow up a battery on the western beach. General Clayton, who was\r\nacting Governor at the time, thereupon wrote to de las Torres in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\r\n\r\n  “Having observed this morning that your Excellency has opened\r\n  a trench in order to attack this fortress, which act I hold to\r\n  be contrary to the treaties existing between our sovereigns, no\r\n  declaration of war yet having reached my knowledge, I therefore\r\n  inform your Excellency, that if you do not forthwith order the\r\n  works to cease I shall be obliged to take necessary measures in\r\n  consequence. I transmit this to your Excellency by my secretary,\r\n  to whom I beg a reply may be delivered.\r\n\r\n  “JASPER CLAYTON.\r\n  “GIBRALTAR, _February 22nd 1727_.”\r\n\r\nTo this letter the Spaniard replied--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--I received your Excellency’s letter of to-day’s date, and\r\n  regarding the trench which has been opened as you say to attack\r\n  the city of Gibraltar, I hereby answer, that what has been done\r\n  has been on our own ground, to fortify those places where our\r\n  batteries might be of good service, and as there belongs nothing\r\n  to that fortress beyond its fortifications, as appears by the\r\n  very treaties your Excellency alludes to; and your Excellency\r\n  having taken possession of the towers within our jurisdiction,\r\n  your Excellency may be fully assured that unless they are\r\n  immediately abandoned I will act in the manner your Excellency\r\n  insinuates to _me_, acquainting you at the same time that for\r\n  besieging the fortress works less distant will be constructed, as\r\n  you will learn in due time.\r\n\r\n  “COUNT DAS TORRES.\r\n  “CAMPO DE GIBRALTAR, _February 22nd 1727_.”\r\n\r\nThis truculent answer clearly meant war, and so Clayton understood\r\nit; but anxious to do nothing to precipitate hostilities, he\r\ncontented himself for the moment with firing one shot over the\r\nbattery as an intimation that work must cease. For an hour he held\r\nhis hand: then, as the Spaniards wholly disregarded the warning, his\r\nguns opened upon them. Thus commenced the second of the series of\r\nsieges in which British troops have successfully defended Gibraltar\r\nagainst heavy, sometimes well-nigh overwhelming odds. The first,\r\nbegun a few months after our capture of the Rock, lasted from\r\nOctober, 1704, to April, 1705; the second continued from the 22nd\r\nof February till the 23rd of June, 1727; the third, or Great Siege,\r\nlasted nearly four years, from the 16th of July, 1779, to the 5th of\r\nFebruary, 1783.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, the Spaniards attacked from the land side only; their navy\r\ntook no part in the operations, which were exclusively directed\r\nagainst the North Front and the defences of the Rock from the\r\nextremity of the old Mole to Willis’s Battery. At the beginning of\r\nthe siege the garrison had only sixty guns in position, the heaviest\r\nbeing 32-prs., and as “most of the ordnance was old and worn out,\r\nmore casualties occurred from the bursting of guns than from the\r\nenemy’s fire.”[69] The Spaniards, on the other hand, brought into\r\naction ninety-two guns and seventy-two mortars, many of them the best\r\nand most modern of their day. De las Torres lost no time in opening\r\nhis trenches. During the night of February 22nd-23rd five battalions\r\nof infantry, a brigade of engineers, and a thousand peasants started\r\nwork on the first parallel, which ran from the Devil’s Tower on the\r\neastern beach along the base of the Rock to the inundation. Next\r\nnight two thousand of the enemy were moved northwards into ground\r\ndead to the guns of the batteries, but not to those of two British\r\nmen-of-war which, under cover of the darkness, had anchored off the\r\neast of the isthmus connecting the fortress with the mainland, or, in\r\nother words, the neutral ground. As soon as it was light the sailors\r\nbrought their guns to bear upon these troops, raking their ranks\r\nfrom end to end, while from the top of the Rock the soldiers hurled\r\ndown upon the Spaniards live shell, hand-grenades, and stones. The\r\nenemy retreated in confusion and with great loss, but de las Torres,\r\nafter driving away the men-of-war by an overwhelming artillery fire,\r\nthrew up batteries so completely commanding the anchorage on the east\r\nof the isthmus that further flanking attacks of this nature became\r\nimpossible. Under a heavy cannonade from the garrison, the Spaniards\r\nworked without intermission, and in spite of heavy and continuous\r\nrain which flooded their trenches and produced much sickness\r\namong their men, gradually completed and unmasked many formidable\r\nbatteries, some of which were within a hundred yards of the Rock.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of March, before further reinforcements began to\r\narrive from England and Minorca, the British troops suffered greatly\r\nfrom fatigue. The guards and piquets were very heavy, absorbing\r\na daily average of 1200 rank and file, and a thousand men were\r\nconstantly occupied in mounting guns and strengthening the defences.\r\nThese working parties were commanded by officers of the line, who\r\nwere struck off all other duty and received half a crown a-day extra\r\npay. The men also drew sixpence a-day extra, and “were assisted by\r\nthe Jews, who were employed in taking ammunition to the batteries and\r\nclearing the ditch of the rubbish beaten down from the upper works\r\nby the enemy’s shot; these unfortunate Israelites received no pay,\r\nand for some time were utterly useless, being paralysed with terror\r\nwhen under fire.”[70] Some of them, perhaps to revenge themselves for\r\nthis forced labour, joined in a conspiracy among the “undesirable”\r\nelement in the civil population to open the gates to the enemy. The\r\nplot was discovered, and punished in the rigorous fashion of the\r\nday--two Moors, the chief agents of the Spaniards, were put to death,\r\nand after their bodies had been flayed the skins were nailed to\r\nthe gates of the fortress as an object lesson on the penalties of\r\nunsuccessful treachery.\r\n\r\nThe elements during the siege were strongly in favour of the British,\r\nfor such deluges of rain fell in April that the Spaniards’ trenches\r\nagain became untenable and their cover was destroyed. Until the\r\ndamage could be made good the opening of the great bombardment was\r\nnecessarily postponed, and during the respite two battalions arrived\r\nfrom home on the 7th of April, and a fortnight later four transports,\r\nescorted by the _Sole Bay_, brought five hundred troops, detachments\r\nfrom the corps stationed in Minorca. How many men the Royal Irish\r\ncontributed is not known; but as Cosby, their colonel, was in command\r\nof the whole contingent, it is natural to suppose that the regiment\r\nwas largely represented. England’s command of the sea enabled her to\r\nreinforce at will, and in the beginning of May two more battalions\r\nreached Gibraltar from home, raising the strength of the garrison to\r\nabout 5500 non-commissioned officers and men. With them came Lord\r\nPortmore, the Governor, who was on leave when the siege began: though\r\nquite an old man he had refused to plead his age and infirmities as\r\nan excuse for evading his duty, and now returned to take his share in\r\nthe defence. As soon as the Spaniards had finished their batteries\r\nand mounted their guns, they opened a tremendous artillery fire,\r\nwhich was kept up for fourteen days without intermission. During\r\nevery hour of this time seven hundred projectiles were hurled against\r\nour works, and to use the words of an eyewitness, “we seemed to\r\nlive in flames.... Attempts feeble in comparison to the resistless\r\nstorm of shot and shell that tore over the walls of the fortress,\r\nwere made to check this murderous fire in vain, guns were everywhere\r\ndismounted, and as quickly as they were replaced were again\r\ndestroyed. In vain the men with dauntless courage threw themselves\r\nupon the ramparts and worked to repair the shattered parapets, the\r\nheavy shot tore away whole tons of earth and buried the guns beneath\r\nthe ruins. Butts filled with sand and bound with fascines were heaped\r\ntogether as some covering from the artillery, but they were no sooner\r\nin position than they were swept away.”[71]\r\n\r\nThe strain of this bombardment, said to have been greater than any\r\nrecorded in the previous history of artillery, proved more than the\r\nSpanish ordnance could stand. By the 20th of May the brass guns began\r\nto droop at the muzzle, the iron guns to burst, and ammunition to\r\nrun short. Gradually the enemy’s fire died down, and when there were\r\nbut nineteen pieces left in action against them the British restored\r\ntheir shattered works, and mounting thirteen new guns and more than\r\na hundred mortars poured upon the Spaniards a storm of projectiles\r\nalmost equalling that which had scourged the defenders of the Rock.\r\nBy dint of tremendous exertions a hundred guns were placed in\r\nposition at the beginning of June, and then the tables were turned,\r\nfor this mass of ordnance opened upon the Spaniards with such a crash\r\nthat not a single gun was able to reply; the trenches became a heap\r\nof ruins; the parapets of the batteries took fire, and the magazines\r\nblew up. The first day’s cannonade drove the enemy from their\r\nforts, and gradually the whole line of works was completely knocked\r\nto pieces. On the 23rd of June the news reached Gibraltar that a\r\nsuspension of hostilities had been arranged between the Governments\r\nof England and Spain: all fighting then ceased; the soldiers had\r\nplayed their part, and it was now for the diplomatists to settle the\r\ndifferences between their respective countries. The British losses\r\nwere remarkably small. Five officers were killed or wounded; in the\r\nother ranks 69 were killed; 49 died from wounds or disease, and 207\r\nwere wounded. It is not known how many of the XVIIIth were injured,\r\nas the casualties of the Minorca contingent are given as a whole. To\r\nthe Spanish army, on the other hand, the siege proved very costly.\r\nFifteen officers were killed, 42 wounded: of the other ranks 346\r\nwere killed, 1119 were wounded, and more than 5000 died of sickness\r\nor were permanently invalided by the hardships they had undergone.\r\nNo less than 875 Spaniards deserted during the siege, some of whom\r\nsurrendered to our piquets and brought much useful information to the\r\nIntelligence officers of the garrison.\r\n\r\nWhen the siege was over, the detachment of the XVIIIth rejoined\r\nheadquarters at Minorca, where the regiment remained until 1742.\r\nNothing would have been known of the life of the Royal Irish during\r\nthis period had not copies been preserved of a curious correspondence\r\nbetween Major Gillman, who was in command, and Major-General\r\nArmstrong, the Colonel of the regiment.[72] The officers were greatly\r\ndisturbed at the quality of the recruits received from home, and\r\nGillman in 1729 thus reports on a recently joined draft of sixteen\r\nmen. “They are the worst I ever saw; two of them the officers would\r\nnot draw for: one of them wanting above half of his right foot, the\r\nother having his backbone and ribs of both sides distorted in a\r\nprodigious manner, by which means he is an object of compassion, both\r\nof which are to be sent back to England at the expense of the person\r\nthat recruited them.”\r\n\r\nTwo years later Gillman again entreats that recruiting should be\r\nproperly conducted.\r\n\r\n  “I beg leave to assure you that you have a corps of captains\r\n  that has the credit of the Regiment entirely at heart and will\r\n  begrudge no expense in supporting it on all occasions therefore\r\n  I am thoroughly convinced you will give such necessary orders\r\n  to the person or persons that are to recruit the regt, that\r\n  they receive no bad or old men upon any account whatever. The\r\n  standard of the regt, is 5′ 7″ without shoes.... I entreat your\r\n  further assistance by getting a few fine fellows at home proper\r\n  for the Grenadier Company let the expense be ever so great which\r\n  I’ll pay with pleasure, and if two or three beautiful men fit\r\n  for sergeants _to_ said Company could be sent over I’ll pay them\r\n  sergeants’ pay until they are provided for because two of the\r\n  sergeants and the three Corporals are the bane of the Company and\r\n  not in the least fit to appear under arms but with disgrace.”\r\n\r\nThe next letter (November 20, 1736) recommends that a commission\r\nshould be granted to Sergeant John Millner, the author of the history\r\nof the war in the Low Countries to which frequent reference has been\r\nmade in Chapter II.\r\n\r\n  “I beg leave to recommend to your favour on this occasion Sergt.\r\n  Millner and if it meets with your condescension I am ready to\r\n  pay down the money for him. I am thoroughly convinced that when\r\n  so good a man has the honour of being known to you you’ll not in\r\n  the least begrudge any favours that you may be pleased to lay\r\n  upon him which he will always own in the most grateful manner\r\n  imaginable.\r\n\r\n  “As I have mentioned to you in mine of 30th August of the\r\n  absolute necessity the regiment lies under that it is high time\r\n  that a Proper Person should be thought of to discharge the duty\r\n  of Adjutant for the reasons therein mentioned. I assure you I\r\n  know of no person so proper in the regiment to discharge that\r\n  duty as Sergeant Millner, who is very willing to do it _gratis_,\r\n  provided it is for your advantage or any other commands you\r\n  should be pleased to lay upon him, as you may judge by his\r\n  journal he wrote of the late war in Flanders to which I find you\r\n  were pleased to be one of the generous subscribers.\r\n\r\n  “I should not take the liberty of recommending this poor man to\r\n  you if I had not sufficient reasons to be thoroughly sensible\r\n  he is capable of discharging any duty that his superiors are\r\n  willing to employ him on, and has on all occasions in a very\r\n  particular manner merited the esteem of all the officers he\r\n  has had the honour of serving under, as you may see by the\r\n  generous subscription in his favour, a copy of which I send you\r\n  enclosed, by which you will plainly see good generous Kane has\r\n  not forgotten the (illegible? regiment) always desiring to be a\r\n  subscriber on the like occasion.”\r\n\r\nInclosure--\r\n\r\n  “We whose names are hereunder written officers of the Royal\r\n  regiment of Ireland in consideration of the long and faithful\r\n  service of Sergeant John Millner do hereby desire and empower\r\n  the agent or paymaster of the said regiment for the time being\r\n  to stop or cause to be stopped out of respective subsistence or\r\n  arrears the sum set against our names whenever the colonel of the\r\n  regiment shall be pleased to recommend the said Millner to his\r\n  Majesty for a commission in the said regiment.”\r\n\r\n  Anthony Pujola,       £10   0  0\r\n  Stephen Gilman,        10   0  0\r\n  Charles Hutchinson,     5   0  0\r\n  W^m.

Therefore I earnestly desire you will\r\n  encourage him in everything that may conduce to his improvement\r\n  in this way of life.\r\n\r\n  “As the first thing a youth should learn at his launching out\r\n  into the World is to know how to live in it, a spirit of economy\r\n  should be cultivated in him, for which purpose he should be\r\n  induced to keep a pocket memorandum book wherein he may with\r\n  other occurrences set down his daily expenses, by perusing of\r\n  which in his leisure hours he may see how the money goes out and\r\n  be thereby enabled to proportion his disbursement to his cash,\r\n  keep out of debt, and thereby avoid the many inconveniences the\r\n  want of due care draws young men into such in the whole course\r\n  of their lives they may not without great difficulty be able to\r\n  extricate themselves.\r\n\r\n  “And in order thereto as youth is oftentimes moved by the company\r\n  they keep I must earnestly desire you will introduce him to that\r\n  of the most discreet and sober gentlemen, and particularly that\r\n  you will have a watchful eye he keeps company with no sharpers\r\n  at play, nor with any persons that may induce him to vices\r\n  destructive of his health. Your due regard to what is above\r\n  written will very much oblige\r\n\r\n  “Your most obed^t.\r\n  “most humble servant,\r\n  “J. ARMSTRONG.”\r\n\r\n  “_P.S._--Care must be taken on his arrival to board him with some\r\n  officer who has a family which I earnestly request you to see\r\n  done, for much depends on a right beginning.”\r\n\r\nArmstrong died in 1742, and was succeeded as colonel of the regiment\r\nby Colonel Sir John Mordaunt, K.B. On its return home in 1742 the\r\nregiment was quartered in the West of England until the spring of\r\n1744, when it was sent to Fareham to guard prisoners taken in the\r\nwars we were then waging with the Spanish and the French. In 1739 a\r\ntrade dispute with Spain had produced a conflict memorable only for\r\nour miserable and costly failure to take Cartagena, a flourishing\r\nsettlement on the Caribbean Sea, in the part of South America then\r\nbelonging to Spain, and now the Republic of Columbia. Soon afterwards\r\na great war broke out on the Continent of Europe between France and\r\nSpain on the one side and Austria on the other. Various German States\r\njoined the Franco-Spanish alliance, while England, Hanover, and\r\nHolland sent contingents to the help of Austria. At Dettingen George\r\nII. gained a victory over the French in 1743, but two years later his\r\nson, the Duke of Cumberland, was defeated at Fontenoy,[73] where the\r\nmagnificent courage and brilliant local success of the British and\r\nHanoverians were nullified by the apathy, cowardice, or jealousy of\r\nthe Austrians and the Dutch, who after Cumberland had actually forced\r\nhis way into the French camp sullenly refused to advance and support\r\nhis column at the moment when victory was within his grasp. Before\r\nthe news of this glorious, though disastrous day reached England, the\r\nRoyal Irish had been warned for service abroad, and formed part of a\r\nsmall column which reached Cumberland in the middle of May. Welcome\r\nas this reinforcement was, it did not nearly fill the gaps caused by\r\nthe slaughter at Fontenoy, where the casualties among the British and\r\nHanoverian infantry amounted to 32 per cent, the former losing 3662,\r\nthe latter 1410 officers and men. With his weakened force Cumberland\r\ncould not stand up against the French, and as far as most of the\r\nEnglish regiments were concerned, the rest of the campaign of 1745\r\nwas spent in entrenching defensive positions, and then, under the\r\npressure of the enemy’s manœuvres, abandoning them, only to repeat\r\nthe experience farther to the rear, while the French, in greatly\r\nsuperior numbers, gradually reduced the fortified towns of Flanders.\r\nSome of these places Marshal Saxe, the French Commander-in-Chief,\r\ntook by force of arms; others capitulated without resistance, and\r\nin August he was able to detach a considerable body of troops to\r\nattack Ostend, a vital point in Cumberland’s lines of communication\r\nwith England. The garrison was hastily reinforced, the last corps to\r\narrive being the Royal Irish, who on the 9th of August embarked at\r\nAntwerp on “billanders,” as the boats used for inland navigation were\r\ncalled, and dropping down the Scheldt to Flushing transhipped into\r\nsea-going vessels for Ostend. The town was in a wretched condition\r\nand quite unfit to stand a siege; the Austrians, to whom it then\r\nbelonged, had allowed the fortifications to fall into disrepair; the\r\nartillery was deficient in guns and stores of every kind, and the\r\nthree thousand infantry, insufficient for the perimeter they had to\r\nguard, were not soldiers of the same nation commanded by generals\r\nof their own army, but detachments of British, of Austrians, and of\r\nDutch--men with no common language and dissimilar in discipline,\r\nhabits, and sentiment. These differences, sufficiently serious in\r\nthemselves, were accentuated by the undisguised contempt of the\r\nEnglish for the Allies who had left them in the lurch at Fontenoy.\r\nNor were these the only difficulties. An essential part in the scheme\r\nof defence was the flooding of a large tract of country round the\r\ntown, but this measure had not been carried into effect, for the\r\nAustrians, unwilling to ruin the peasants by inundating the villages\r\nand farms, were so slow in issuing the necessary orders that when\r\nat length labourers were sent to open the sluices, the French were\r\nclose at hand and prevented the working parties from accomplishing\r\ntheir task. To have defended Ostend successfully would have taxed the\r\npowers of a great leader of men, and none arose to snatch the reins\r\nof office from the hands of the governor, a veteran grown old and\r\ndecrepit in the Austrian service. The General appointed to command\r\nthe British arrived after the town was invested, and was unable to\r\nmake his way into Ostend; an Austrian officer of the same rank, de\r\nChanclos, was more fortunate, but though he acted as confidential\r\nadviser to the Governor he had not the time, even if he possessed the\r\ncapacity, to weld the heterogeneous garrison into a good fighting\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the Royal Irish left Antwerp a French General,\r\nLöwendahl, appeared before Ostend with 21,000 good troops, a numerous\r\nartillery, and 5000 pack horses, laden with fascines for the siege;\r\nhe finished his first parallel on the 14th of August, and next day\r\nthrew up batteries on the shore to enfilade the harbour and to keep\r\nat a distance the British frigates which hovered about the port.\r\nAfter thus cutting off Ostend from communication with England he\r\npushed on his works with vigour, and on the 18th twenty pieces of\r\nartillery and ten or twelve mortars opened a violent cannonade which\r\nlasted for four days almost without intermission. The defending\r\ntroops were greatly overworked; half of them were constantly at\r\nthe batteries or in the covered way; the remainder had to be ready\r\nto turn out at a moment’s notice, and as there were no casemates\r\nor bomb-proofs, the only shelter for the men when off duty was\r\nin barracks and private houses, which rapidly crumbled under the\r\nFrench projectiles. The officers were rather better off, for they\r\nshared with the sick and wounded the cellars of the town-hall, made\r\nshell-proof with walls of sandbags. All ranks were vilely fed; the\r\nofficer of the XVIIIth who wrote the anonymous ‘Continuation of\r\nStearne’s Journal’ says “the beef stank, the biscuits were full of\r\nmaggots.” There were not enough artillerymen to man the guns; when\r\nthe gun carriages were knocked to pieces by round shot there were\r\nnone in reserve to replace them, and by the end of the siege only\r\nseven pieces of ordnance remained fit for use. Three days after the\r\nbombardment began de Chanclos wrote gloomily to Cumberland--\r\n\r\n  “This town is a heap of ruins ... the great fatigue, and entire\r\n  absence of quiet, night or day, owing to bomb-shells and\r\n  cannon-balls, put the garrison into very bad humour, and it is\r\n  really not saying too much to call it bad. I might even add that\r\n  one must be an Englishman to put up with what we are suffering\r\n  here! The enemy is sapping up to the covered way and is attacking\r\n  on our weakest side. Nearly all our cannon have been dismounted,\r\n  many artillerymen have been killed and the survivors decline to\r\n  work the guns.”\r\n\r\nHe thus reported the loss of the town:\r\n\r\n  “_August 24._\r\n\r\n  “On the night of the 22nd a general assault was made on our\r\n  covered way by fifteen companies of Grenadiers, supported by two\r\n  battalions. The point chosen was the sea front at low water. We\r\n  repulsed the enemy more than once, killing and wounding 500 men,\r\n  and making prisoners of 2 captains, a lieutenant, and 30 odd\r\n  grenadiers. At day break I assembled my commanding officers to\r\n  obtain their opinion as to our situation. Everyone agreed that we\r\n  could not hope to hold out for more than a few days.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as this informal Council of War was over de Chanclos ordered\r\nhis drummers to beat the _Chamade_; and after obtaining a truce for\r\nthe burial of his dead he offered to capitulate on condition that\r\nthe garrison should be allowed to march out of Ostend with all the\r\nhonours of war, and be escorted safely to Austrian territory.[74] In\r\nproposing these terms he forgot to specify the Austrian fortress to\r\nwhich his troops were to be conveyed, the route by which they were\r\nto travel, and the date on which they were to arrive. The French\r\nGeneral, however, noticed these omissions, and with suspicious\r\nalacrity agreed to Chanclos’s terms: the garrison marched out with\r\nall due pomp, fully expecting to be escorted at once to the nearest\r\nAustrian town; but soon the troops learned to their deep disgust that\r\nthe French had discovered the flaws in the articles of capitulation,\r\nand were about to send them by a devious route to Mons. This was\r\nconsidered very sharp practice, not at all worthy of an honourable\r\nenemy; but the King of France had every reason for wishing to\r\ndeprive England as long as possible of the services of the defenders\r\nof Ostend, for the young Pretender, Charles Edward, had landed in\r\nScotland; the rebellion, known in history as “the ’45,” was rapidly\r\ngaining strength; and Government was clamouring for the return from\r\nBelgium of the British troops. After a short halt at Ghent, they were\r\ncrowded into canal boats for an involuntary “personally conducted”\r\ntour through Belgium, and from the description left by an officer of\r\nthe regiment it is clear that the most ardent sight-seers could have\r\nextracted no pleasure from this journey.\r\n\r\n  “We were escorted by a party of Horse, and constantly attended by\r\n  agents of theirs (the French) whose business it was to inveigle\r\n  away our men, and by large promises (of which these rascals\r\n  were not sparing) induce them to desert; as our progress was\r\n  rendered designedly slow we were only drawn by the boors of the\r\n  country a very few miles a day. A French trooper with his carbine\r\n  was placed at the head of each billander, who did not fail to\r\n  threaten the poor wretches with firing at them whenever they did\r\n  not pull to please them. We continued on board this incommodious\r\n  embarcation seventeen days, when we arrived in Tournai, where we\r\n  disembarked.”\r\n\r\nAs Tournai is about thirty-two miles from Mons, the column should\r\nhave begun its march very early in the morning to have covered the\r\ndistance in one day, but the escort refused to move till 8 A.M.,\r\nand consequently it was 7 o’clock in the evening before the British\r\narrived at St Gillain, a fortified village held by the Austrians\r\nas an outpost to Mons, a few miles farther on. Alleging that in\r\nbringing the garrison of Ostend to this outpost they had fulfilled\r\ntheir undertaking, the French halted, ceremoniously saluted the\r\nColours of each regiment, and then retired. The British officers\r\nwere at a loss to understand why the French had left the column at\r\nSt Gillain instead of escorting it to Mons, but in a few minutes\r\nthey learned the reason from an Austrian general whom Cumberland\r\nhad sent to meet them. A large body of the enemy’s troops were\r\nlurking in the neighbourhood, with orders to attack St Gillain if\r\nthe regiments from Ostend remained there, and if they attempted to\r\nreach Mons to capture or exterminate them on the march; the only\r\nhope of escape, therefore, was to start at once on the chance that\r\nthe intercepting force had not already taken up its position. Without\r\na moment’s delay the ranks were re-formed, the pans of the muskets\r\nre-primed and the bayonets fixed; then in profound silence the weary\r\ntroops plodded along the causeway leading towards Mons. “As it was\r\na moonlight night we could command a view of the country about us,\r\nand as we every moment expected the enemy we continued our march in\r\nthe greatest order; not a whisper was to be heard; the officers who\r\nwere present will always remember with pleasure the discipline and\r\ngood disposition every regiment showed on that occasion. At eleven\r\nwe arrived at Mons, where owing to some mismanagement we waited\r\ntwo hours before we got admittance.”[75] This delay was obviously\r\ncaused by bad staff work, but the arrangements of the French were\r\nno better. The enemy, confident that the Ostend troops would be too\r\ntired to push on that night, left no patrols to watch the exits\r\nfrom the village, with the result that 20,000 Frenchmen took up a\r\nposition astride the causeway an hour after the refugees had found\r\nsafety within the walls of Mons. For three weeks the Royal Irish\r\nwere blockaded in this fortress; then thanks to the manœuvres of a\r\nrelieving force they “slipped out” at dead of night, and in a few\r\ndays reached the neighbourhood of Brussels.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Scotland were now going so badly that nearly every English\r\nsoldier was recalled from the Continent to defend England against the\r\nJacobite invasion. The XVIIIth landed at Gravesend early in November,\r\nand after various changes of quarters embarked for the seat of war in\r\nScotland in the spring of 1746. On the voyage a vexatious incident\r\noccurred by which the regiment was prevented from taking any active\r\npart in the Scotch campaign. While off the coast of Yorkshire the\r\ntransports, containing the 12th, 16th, XVIIIth, and 24th regiments,\r\nwere warned that three French men-of-war were cruising in the\r\nneighbourhood; the ships ran for safety into the Humber, where they\r\nremained until the report was proved to have no foundation; and owing\r\nto this delay the Royal Irish did not reach Leith until the day\r\nafter the rebels had been finally crushed at the battle of Culloden.\r\nFor two years the regiment was stationed in Scotland, in the summer\r\nmaking military roads in the Highlands, in the winter quartered at\r\nvarious towns, and when the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle put an end to\r\nthe war the XVIIIth was ordered to Ireland, after it had been placed\r\non a peace footing by reductions so sweeping that the establishment\r\nof each company was fixed at two sergeants, two corporals, one\r\ndrummer, and twenty-nine private soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1755, our relations with France were again strained to breaking\r\npoint: in America the French garrison of Canada and the British\r\ngarrison of the colonies on the Atlantic coast were waging fierce,\r\nthough unofficial war in the forests south of the river St Lawrence;\r\nand as the conflict seemed likely to spread to Europe, troops\r\nwere withdrawn from Ireland to Great Britain. Among the regiments\r\nhurriedly brought across St George’s Channel was the XVIIIth, rapidly\r\nrecruited up to a strength of seventy-eight men per company. But\r\nthe “Seven Years’ War” brought no laurels to the Royal Irish, who\r\nwere condemned to inactivity in the United Kingdom, while other\r\ncorps were winning fame on the Continent and in the West Indies, in\r\nCanada and the Philippine Islands. In 1767, four years after peace\r\nwas declared, the regiment was ordered to Philadelphia, the capital\r\nof Pennsylvania, one of the oldest of our American colonies. The\r\nbeginning of the lamentable quarrel between the mother-country and\r\nher English-speaking over-sea provinces found the Royal Irish still\r\nquartered at Philadelphia, but in 1774, Boston, the chief town of\r\nthe colony of Massachusetts, became such a hotbed of disaffection\r\nthat General Gage, who commanded the troops in British North America,\r\nreinforced its garrison with troops drawn from less disloyal centres\r\nof population. Among the regiments ordered to Boston was the\r\nXVIIIth, at that time very weak in numbers, for hardly any recruits\r\nhad arrived from home, and those enlisted at Philadelphia were\r\n“bounty-jumpers,” who deserted at every opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the breach between England and the provincials, as\r\nthe colonists were then called, have been discussed in innumerable\r\nhistories, and are far too complex to be dealt with in the chronicles\r\nof a regiment. It is enough to say here that the dispute began about\r\nquestions of taxation and trade; the home Government was stupid,\r\nslow, and overbearing in its dealings with the provincials, who on\r\ntheir side were petulant, aggressive, and impatient of control. Many\r\nof the young Americans believed that as all danger of an attack by\r\nFrance had been removed by the British conquest of Canada, they would\r\nbe better off as citizens of a republic than as subjects of King\r\nGeorge. Both sides were unable to regard the matters at issue from\r\na point of view other than their own: the English Government failed\r\nto appreciate the restlessness and desire for expansion natural to\r\nyoung and growing communities of British stock; the provincials were\r\nequally unable to realise how slowly new ideas penetrated into the\r\nbrains of the governing classes at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 2.\r\n\r\n  SKETCH MAP\r\n  OF\r\n  THE LOW COUNTRIES\r\n  1692. 1694-7. 1701-14. 1745\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1775 the whole of Massachusetts was seething\r\nwith scarcely veiled rebellion, and though the inhabitants of Boston\r\nitself were overawed by the presence of Gage’s troops, the rural\r\npopulation was so hostile that it was unsafe for officers to go any\r\ndistance into the country without a strong and well-armed escort. The\r\nexcitement was increased by the action of the provincial Parliament,\r\nwhich, issuing a proclamation urging all able-bodied men to arm\r\nthemselves and join the militia, began to collect warlike stores at\r\nvarious places in the colony. One of these depôts was at Concord,\r\na village twenty miles from Boston; Gage determined to burn its\r\ncontents, and on the night of the 18th of April sent a raiding party\r\nof eighteen hundred men upon this errand of destruction. Under\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel Smith the flank companies--_i.e._\r\nthe grenadiers and light infantry[76]--of the 5th, 10th, XVIIIth,\r\n23rd, 38th, 43rd, 52nd, and 59th regiments started from Boston\r\nbefore midnight, followed a few hours later by Lord Percy with a\r\nsupporting body composed of the whole of the 4th and 47th regiments,\r\nthe battalion companies of the 23rd, and ten companies of marines.\r\nAs it was known that the provincials’ intelligence department was\r\nwell organised, every precaution was taken to keep the expedition\r\nsecret; but though the gates of the town had been closed early in the\r\nevening and the troops assembled silently at dead of night, their\r\nmovements were reported by the anti-British faction in Boston, and\r\nas they marched through the darkness the ringing of bells and firing\r\nof guns warned them that the alarm had been given throughout the\r\ncountryside. At daybreak the advance-guard ran into a small body of\r\nmilitia at Lexington: there was a parley, followed by a skirmish in\r\nwhich several provincials were hit and the remainder retreated in\r\ndisorder. Smith lost no time in pushing on to Concord, and while his\r\ngrenadiers began to demolish the stores some of the light companies\r\nguarded the approaches to the village.\r\n\r\nSo far the raid had been successful, but before describing how\r\nrapidly the tables were turned against the troops, the reader must\r\nrealise with what manner of men Smith’s detachment was about to\r\ntry conclusions. The original settlers in Massachusetts were of\r\npicked British stock; the large majority had left the old country\r\nto escape from the restraints imposed by the Stuarts upon liberty\r\nof conscience, while others had sought in the New World a freer\r\nand more adventurous life than England could afford. The mere fact\r\nthat these men and women had the courage to leave their homes and\r\nfriends to face the horrors of the unknown, proved them to be above\r\nthe average in courage and steadfastness of purpose; and the hard\r\nlife of pioneers; the incessant struggle with nature in a rude\r\nclimate; fierce fights with the Red Indian savages, who tortured\r\ntheir captives before killing them; long hunting expeditions in\r\nvast and trackless forests; life on lonely farms where every man\r\nwas thrown on his own resources--all had contributed to develop a\r\nrace of over-sea Britons as formidable to their enemies as they\r\nwould have been valuable to the Empire if they had been treated with\r\ntact, consideration, and justice. It was not in pioneering alone\r\nthat the New Englanders had found vent for their restless energy;\r\nthey had taken part in many of our expeditions during the first half\r\nof the eighteenth century. In the disastrous failure at Cartagena\r\na considerable number of New Englanders shared in our defeat, and\r\ncarried home with them a sorry report of the conduct of the army;\r\na contingent of colonists with justice claimed a large share in\r\nthe glory of the capture of Louisburg, the French Gibraltar at the\r\nmouth of the St Lawrence; and in all the interesting, though now\r\nforgotten fights between the English and the French in the country\r\nround Lake Champlain American volunteers fought side by side with\r\nthe regular troops. Thus when the provincials determined to take up\r\narms against England, many of the men who later became generals of\r\nnote in the republican army had served their apprenticeship to war\r\nunder the Colours of the mother-country. They had studied our drill;\r\nthey understood our tactics; they knew the merits and demerits of\r\nour soldiers, and very soon learned how best to meet our slow and\r\ncumbrous movements with their imperfectly trained volunteers, who at\r\nthe beginning of the War of Independence had many points in common\r\nwith the Boers of 1899. Both were ardently patriotic; self-reliant\r\nto a fault; wholly undisciplined and obeying no order that did not\r\nappeal to them as individuals; both fought in bands of friends and\r\nneighbours, not infrequently commanded by the local preacher. In\r\none respect, however, the Boers and the American colonists differed\r\nwidely. In none of their encounters with the British did the burghers\r\never hold their ground with determination when things had begun to\r\ngo badly with them, while at Bunker’s Hill, the first real battle\r\nof the revolutionary war, the provincials “fought to a finish” with\r\nsuch grim tenacity that, had our army been engaged, not with a raw\r\nmilitia, but with European regular troops, its dearly bought success\r\nwould have been extolled as a feat of arms equal to any in the annals\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nWhile Smith’s grenadiers were looking for the warlike stores, the\r\nlight infantry outposts were attacked and driven back into Concord\r\nby a very superior force of provincials, who from far and wide had\r\ncollected to do battle with the red-coats. Boys, full-grown men,\r\ngreybeards almost tottering to the grave, turned out with splendid\r\nenthusiasm from the hamlets of Lincoln, Bedford, Carlisle, and\r\nChelmsford, and surrounding the village like a swarm of bees, set\r\nthemselves to sting the intruders to death with musketry. Smith\r\ndetermined to retire, and as his column filed out of Concord it\r\nbecame the target of sharpshooters lurking behind houses and log\r\nfences and in the woods bordering the rough track that led to\r\nBoston. In vain were flanking parties thrown out to keep the enemy\r\nat a distance from the main body; the provincials disappeared among\r\nthe trees and then reappeared farther down the road, using their\r\nfirearms with deadly effect. The soldiers replied so vigorously that\r\nammunition began to fail them, and as it was impossible to charge a\r\nfoe who had no formation and whose position was only indicated by\r\nisolated puffs of smoke on every side of the column, Smith retreated\r\nas fast as possible towards Lexington, losing men at every step. His\r\ntroops straggled into the village so worn out by hunger and thirst,\r\nso demoralised by the biting fire of an almost invisible enemy, that\r\nwhen they saw Lord Percy’s detachment drawn up to protect them they\r\nflung themselves on the ground, so badly shaken that the supporting\r\ntroops had to form square round them. For a time there was a lull in\r\nthe firing; but when more contingents joined the provincials they\r\nre-opened such a vigorous fusilade that Percy decided to lose no time\r\nin retiring to Boston, fifteen miles away. He handled with much skill\r\nthe regiments which had accompanied him, falling back from position\r\nto position so steadily as to keep his pursuers in some check;\r\nand notwithstanding the ever-increasing volume of fire with which\r\nreinforcements from Cambridge and Dorchester enabled the colonists\r\nto torment him, by nightfall he succeeded in bringing the shattered\r\ncolumn safely into Boston. When the casualty returns were prepared,\r\nit was found that this disastrous little expedition had cost us in\r\nkilled, wounded, and prisoners, nineteen officers and two hundred\r\nand fifty of the other ranks--a total to which the flank companies\r\nof the XVIIIth contributed two private soldiers killed and four\r\nwounded,[77] while the losses of the provincials were rather less\r\nthan a hundred fighting men. The news of the American success spread\r\nlike wildfire throughout New England; colony after colony threw in\r\nits lot with Massachusetts, and in a few days between sixteen and\r\ntwenty thousand provincials had assembled for the blockade of Boston,\r\nthen garrisoned by eleven battalions, all under strength, the weakest\r\nof all being the Royal Irish, who on the 25th of June could only\r\nmuster two hundred and fifty-seven of all ranks. Although there was\r\na British fleet at anchor in the bay, Gage could do nothing until\r\nmore soldiers arrived from England, and by the time the long-expected\r\nreinforcements reached him Boston was closely invested by the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nWhen the first emigrants to Massachusetts decided on the site of\r\ntheir principal town they selected an almost land-locked bay of\r\nthe Atlantic, where there was good anchorage and shelter from the\r\nwinter gales. This bay was almost bridged by two peninsulas, which\r\nfrom opposite shores jutted so far towards each other that at the\r\nnearest point they were only five hundred yards apart. Boston was\r\nbuilt on the southern of these headlands; on the northern, the\r\nvillage of Charlestown nestled at the foot of an underfeature of the\r\nsemicircle of low hills enveloping the bay. From Bunker’s Hill, as\r\nthe southern end of this underfeature was called, Boston lay within\r\ncannon-shot; but neither side attempted to occupy this important\r\nposition until Gage’s reinforcements arrived. Then the British\r\nGeneral determined to seize it, but the Americans, acting either by\r\nintuition or on information from their spies in Boston, forestalled\r\nhim. On the evening of the 16th of June twelve hundred men paraded\r\non the common at Cambridge, attended a prayer-meeting, and then\r\nstarted on an enterprise the object of which was known only to the\r\nmost senior of their officers. The column was commanded by Colonel\r\nPrescott, who had so greatly distinguished himself at the capture of\r\nLouisburg from the French during the Seven Years’ war that the home\r\nGovernment had offered him a commission in the regular army. Many of\r\nthe men in his ranks had seen powder burned in earnest, and though\r\ntheir muskets were heavy and unwieldy, they had learned to use them\r\nin the pursuit of big game, where an ill-aimed bullet may cost the\r\nhunter his life. By the glimmer of dark lanterns Prescott led his\r\nmen across the isthmus connecting the Charlestown peninsula with the\r\nmainland, then crossed Bunker’s Hill and halted on a lower ridge,\r\nBreed’s Hill, where he quickly traced the lines of a redoubt. To the\r\nprovincials digging was no novelty, and they plied pick and shovel so\r\nsilently and so assiduously that when the day broke the sailors on\r\nboard the nearest man-of-war saw to their amazement an entrenchment,\r\nsix feet high, standing where overnight there had been nothing\r\nbut smooth pasture land. The ships lost no time in opening fire,\r\nand the colonists, unable to reply to our big guns, were growing\r\nunsteady when Prescott hoisted himself on to the parapet where,\r\nunder a heavy but ill-directed cannonade he sauntered up and down,\r\ngiving directions to his working parties and encouraging those men\r\nwhose courage was not as steadfast as his own. With such an example\r\nbefore them none of the militia flinched; the redoubt grew apace,\r\nand was practically finished before the troops in Boston were ready\r\nto attack it. But though Prescott had every reason to be satisfied\r\nwith the temper and industry of his detachment, his situation was a\r\ndesperate one, and had Gage availed himself of all the resources at\r\nhis command, not one of the twelve hundred adventurers would have\r\nmade his way back to the provincial camps. The British had command\r\nof the bay; vessels of light draught could sail close to any part of\r\nthe peninsula; the isthmus, the only possible line of retreat for the\r\nAmericans, was low, sandy, and less than two hundred yards in width.\r\nGage could have landed behind the entrenchments, and have attacked\r\nthe Americans simultaneously in front and rear; he could have cut off\r\ntheir retreat and starved them into surrender by fortifying himself\r\nupon the isthmus, or by stationing gunboats on either side of it, he\r\ncould have made it absolutely impassable by cross fire. These schemes\r\nwere suggested to him, but neither he nor any of the British army\r\nwere in the mood for scientific fighting, and he decided to regain\r\nthe prestige lost at Concord and Lexington by a direct frontal attack\r\nupon Breed’s Hill.[78] Four complete battalions and twenty flank\r\ncompanies, including the grenadiers and light infantry of the Royal\r\nIrish, were rowed across to the Charlestown peninsula--the right wing\r\nunder General Pigot was composed of the provisional battalion of\r\nlight infantry, the 38th and 43rd regiments; in the left wing were\r\nthe provisional battalion of grenadiers, the 5th and 52nd regiments,\r\ncommanded by General Howe. While the troops were landing on ground\r\nwell out of range of the Americans the officers had time to study the\r\nposition they were to carry. It was a strong one: a gentle slope,\r\ncovered with long grass and cut up by a series of fences calculated\r\nto throw advancing troops into disorder, led up to the redoubt and to\r\na breastwork, which ran for a hundred yards towards the enemy’s left.\r\nBetween the end of this breastwork and the sea was a gap, held by a\r\ndetachment posted at the foot of Bunker’s Hill, where the only cover\r\nwas a low stone wall, on which hay was piled to give it additional\r\nheight. The total frontage occupied was about six hundred yards,\r\ndefended when the fight began by fifteen hundred men and six pieces\r\nof artillery.[79] The British brought between two thousand and two\r\nthousand five hundred troops into the field, for in addition to the\r\nunits already mentioned the 47th regiment and a battalion of Marines\r\ncame into action during the fight.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock in the afternoon Howe, who was the senior officer\r\non the Charlestown peninsula, gave the order to advance. At first\r\nthe movement was covered by the fire of eight pieces--field-guns\r\nand howitzers, which had been ferried across from Boston, but soon\r\nthe supply of cannon-balls ran out, and as the officer in charge\r\nof the artillery reported that a marsh prevented his pushing on to\r\nwithin grape-shot range of the enemy, the infantry for a long time\r\nwere unsupported by the guns. After the regiments had deployed, the\r\nlight infantry was directed against the enemy’s left, while the\r\ngrenadiers, 5th and 52nd, with the 38th and 43rd in second line,\r\nwere to storm the breastwork and the redoubt. The day was intensely\r\nhot, and the soldiers, burdened with heavy knapsacks, three days’\r\nrations, cartouche-boxes, ammunition, bayonets, and muskets weighing\r\nfifteen pounds, mounted the hill slowly though in good order. They\r\nwere allowed to open fire too soon, and their volleys, delivered with\r\nperfect precision, were almost ineffective. The provincials wished\r\nto reply while their enemies were a long way off, but their leaders\r\nknew better than to allow such a waste of ammunition, and while some\r\nthreatened to cut down the first man who discharged his firelock\r\nwithout orders, others ran along the top of the parapet kicking the\r\nmuzzles into the air. It was not until the red-coats were within\r\nfifty or sixty yards that the Americans were allowed to shoot, and\r\nthen their well-aimed musketry was so terrible that the whole British\r\nline recoiled before it to the bottom of the hill. Howe re-formed his\r\ntroops, and again led them up the slope, only to be hurled backwards\r\nonce more with a loss so heavy that the glacis of Breed’s Hill looked\r\nmore like the breach of a fortress after an assault than an ordinary\r\nbattlefield. But though they had twice failed to reach the works of\r\nthe Americans neither Howe nor his men were beaten, and the General\r\nhad the moral courage to order a third attack, while the soldiers\r\n\r\n  “had that in them which raised them to the level of a feat of\r\n  arms to which it is not easy, and perhaps not even possible, to\r\n  recall a parallel. Awful as was the slaughter of Albuera, the\r\n  contest was eventually decided by a body, however scanty, of\r\n  fresh troops. The cavalry which pierced the French centre at\r\n  Blenheim had been hotly engaged but, for the most part, had not\r\n  been worsted. But at Bunker’s Hill every corps had been broken;\r\n  every corps had been decimated several times over; and yet the\r\n  same battalions, or what was left of them, a third time mounted\r\n  that fatal slope with the intention of staying on the summit.\r\n  Howe had learned his lesson, and perceived that he was dealing\r\n  with adversaries whom it required something besides the manœuvres\r\n  of the parade ground to conquer. And to conquer, then and there,\r\n  he was steadfastly resolved, in spite of the opposition which\r\n  respectfully indeed, but quite openly, made itself heard around\r\n  him. He ordered the men to unbuckle and lay down their knapsacks,\r\n  to press forward without shooting, and to rely on the bayonet\r\n  alone until they were on the inner side of the wall.... The\r\n  officers who had remonstrated with him for proposing to send the\r\n  troops to what they described as downright butchery, when they\r\n  were informed of his decision, returned quietly to their posts,\r\n  and showed by their behaviour that in protesting against any\r\n  further bloodshed they had been speaking for the sake of their\r\n  soldiers and not of themselves.”[80]\r\n\r\nPrescott had begun to ask for reinforcements of men and ammunition\r\nearly in the day, but, as was to be expected in a volunteer army\r\nchiefly officered by amateurs, the staff arrangements were so bad\r\nthat very few troops and no ammunition reached him during the action.\r\nThus when Howe for the third time hurled himself at the redoubt, none\r\nof its defenders had more than two rounds left. These last shots were\r\nnot wasted, for as the troops rushed with fixed bayonets towards\r\nthe work a venomous fire brought nearly every man in the front rank\r\nheadlong to the ground; but without a check the ranks in rear surged\r\nover the parapet, and falling-to with the cold steel drove the\r\nprovincials in confusion out of the redoubt. With empty muskets and\r\nwith few bayonets the Americans could do little at close quarters,\r\nbut many fought stubbornly as they retreated, admirably covered by\r\nthe men on Bunker’s Hill, who, though heavily cannonaded by the\r\nfleet, held their ground until their comrades from Breed’s Hill had\r\nshaken off pursuit. This engagement cost our provincial kinsmen 115\r\nkilled and 300 wounded, while of the old-country men 19 officers were\r\nkilled and 70 wounded; in the other ranks 207 were killed and 758\r\nwounded--a total of 1054 casualties.[81] The enormous proportion of\r\nlosses among the commissioned ranks was due to the good shooting of\r\npicked marksmen, who were kept supplied with loaded weapons by their\r\nneighbours. These sharpshooters devoted themselves to picking off\r\nthe officers, whose glittering gorgets not only revealed their rank,\r\nbut gave an excellent target at which to aim. Of the part played in\r\nthe action by the grenadier and light companies of the Royal Irish\r\nno particulars have been preserved; nothing is known beyond the\r\nfact that three privates were killed and an officer, Lieutenant W.\r\nRichardson, and seven privates wounded.[82] Compared to the carnage\r\nin some of the flank companies, the losses of the XVIIIth were\r\ninsignificant, yet the actual percentage was high, for in June,\r\n1775,[83] the companies of the regiment only averaged twenty-six of\r\nall ranks, and though the grenadiers and light infantry were usually\r\na little stronger than the battalion companies, it is doubtful\r\nwhether between them they brought more than sixty-five or seventy men\r\ninto the field.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gage’s dearly-won victory secured to the British the\r\npossession of the Charlestown peninsula, and thus guaranteed them\r\nagainst bombardment from Bunker’s Hill, it did not improve the\r\nsituation in other respects. Soon after the battle Washington was\r\nelected to the command of the provincial army, and so closely\r\ninvested Boston that the garrison began to suffer from the want of\r\nfresh food. At first the daily ration of salt pork and peas was\r\noccasionally varied by fish, but this source of supply was cut\r\noff by the American general, who dragged a number of whale-boats\r\noverland from the neighbourhood of Cape Cod to the head-waters of\r\none of the rivers flowing into the bay, and manned the flotilla with\r\nsailors, of whom there were many in his ranks. With this mosquito\r\nfleet he effectually stopped all fishing operations, and under the\r\nvery guns of our warships captured small craft, and seized the\r\nsheep and cattle grazing on the islands in the bay. That such things\r\nwere possible shows the depths of inefficiency to which our fleet\r\non the American station had sunk in 1775; supine and stupid as were\r\nthe generals, they seemed models of talent and energy when compared\r\nwith the admirals with whom they were expected to co-operate. The\r\nwant of proper food produced much illness, especially among the\r\nwounded, whose diet in hospital was the same as that of the men at\r\nduty; and the mortality was great. Coal ran so short that wooden\r\nhouses and churches were pulled down for firewood. Small-pox broke\r\nout and claimed many victims. The duties, heavy everywhere, proved\r\nparticularly trying at the outposts, for the provincials, ignoring\r\nthe rule of war that piquets are not to be fired upon wantonly,\r\nused to amuse themselves by forming parties to stalk and shoot down\r\nthe sentries as they paced their beats. Beyond these occasional\r\nskirmishes there was no fighting; at first the gunners cannonaded\r\nthe enemy’s position, but with so little success that the general\r\ndecided to waste no more powder in teaching the Americans how to\r\nstand fire. As month after month passed in misery and inaction, the\r\nsoldiers, badly fed, thoroughly dispirited and profoundly bored, grew\r\nmoody, dirty, careless about their dress, while discipline was only\r\nmaintained by the stern sentences of the courts-martial which awarded\r\npunishments of four hundred, six hundred, and even a thousand lashes.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cabinet realised that Boston was in great want of food\r\nthey sent out many ships filled with stores of every kind. But\r\nthe ill-luck which dogged the British throughout the American war\r\nprevented the arrival of these vessels. Some were lost at sea; others\r\nwere blown by a tempest to the West Indies; while others again,\r\nladen with cannon and mortars, muskets, flints, and much powder and\r\nshot fell into the hands of the Americans, who under Washington’s\r\nfostering care were rapidly forming a national fleet. These munitions\r\nof war were not the only provincial spoils: a daring raid against\r\nisolated forts on the Canadian frontier secured a large number of\r\nguns, and early in March, 1776, Washington began to bombard Boston\r\nwith British ordnance, and took possession of high ground to the\r\nsouth of the town, which from want of men neither Gage nor his\r\nsuccessor Howe had been able to include within their lines. This\r\nposition commanded the harbour, and the Admiral warned the General\r\nplainly that unless the soldiers could recapture it the men-of-war\r\nand transports would be obliged to put to sea. Thereupon Howe, who\r\nhad long realised that it was impossible to maintain himself in\r\nBoston, ordered its evacuation, and on the 17th of March, with the\r\nnine thousand troops remaining to him and eleven hundred loyalists\r\nwho refused to remain behind, he set sail for Halifax in Nova\r\nScotia, in ships so overcrowded that many valuable stores had to be\r\nleft to fall into Washington’s hands, while much of the officers’\r\nheavy baggage shared the same fate. The Americans did not hinder\r\nthe embarkation, for Howe had given out that if the bombardment was\r\nresumed he would set fire to the town, and Washington, to whom the\r\nthreat was reported by his spies, allowed him to depart in peace. The\r\nmen-of-war, after seeing the troopships safely out to sea, hung about\r\nthe coast of Massachusetts for a time, but effected nothing, and then\r\nwere ordered to other parts of the theatre of war.\r\n\r\nThe XVIIIth had been so worn down by privations and misery at Boston,\r\nthat it was ordered home to recruit. The men still fit for active\r\nservice were drafted into other regiments, while the officers,\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and invalids of the Royal Irish returned\r\nto England in the course of the summer of 1776. The XVIIIth was not\r\nactively employed during the remainder of this war, which, beginning\r\nwith our attempt to suppress the rebellion in North America,\r\ndeveloped into a struggle for existence against the combined forces\r\nof France, Holland, and Spain; for these countries, seeing that our\r\nresources were heavily taxed by the struggle in America, and desirous\r\nto pay off old scores, took up arms against us. For a time we lost\r\nthe command of the sea, and could not reinforce Cornwallis when\r\nhe was besieged at Yorktown by Washington’s provincial troops and\r\na large body of French regular soldiers. After a gallant defence,\r\nYorktown fell, and with the lowering of Cornwallis’s flag passed away\r\nBritain’s last hope of reconquering her rebellious provinces. By the\r\npeace of 1783, England was compelled to recognise the independence of\r\nthe United States, as her revolted colonies now styled themselves; to\r\nrestore Florida and Minorca to Spain, and to cede to France the West\r\nIndian islands of St Lucia and Tobago.\r\n\r\nFrom 1776 to 1783, the Royal Irish were stationed in England and in\r\nthe Channel Islands, where their officers drilled and disciplined\r\nthe recruits to such purpose that when the young soldiers were\r\nsuddenly called upon to perform a most unpleasant duty they were\r\nthoroughly equal to the occasion. Early in 1783 the XVIIIth was in\r\nGuernsey, where one of the regiments of the garrison had acquired\r\nan evil reputation for insubordination. This corps (long since\r\ndisbanded) suddenly broke out into open mutiny, and after coercing\r\nits colonel into promising them privileges entirely subversive of\r\nall discipline, apparently settled down; the officers, thinking the\r\ntrouble was over for the moment, went to their mess-room and sat\r\ndown to dinner, when a shower of bullets came rattling about their\r\nears. They took cover under the table, but the would-be murderers\r\nmounted to windows from which they could pour plunging fire into the\r\nmess-room, and were shooting vigorously when a sergeant advised the\r\nofficers to make a dash for the gate of the fort. They did so, and by\r\ngreat luck escaping unhurt by the volley with which their appearance\r\nin the barrack-square was greeted, hurried into the town to give\r\nthe alarm. Two of their number, however, could not run, and found\r\nshelter in a coal cellar! As soon as this outbreak was reported,\r\nthe local militia was turned out, and the XVIIIth ordered to parade\r\nforthwith; the fort was surrounded; the drums sounded a “parley”;\r\nbut the mutineers at first declined to treat, and then demanded\r\nthat they should be disbanded and sent back to their homes at once.\r\nWhen the Lieutenant-Governor attempted to reason with them, these\r\nmadmen fired at him and next turned their muskets on the troops.\r\nThen more infantry came up, followed by some guns; and there seemed\r\nevery prospect of a sharp fight, when the mutineers suddenly lost\r\nheart, piled arms, and marching quietly out of the fort, surrendered.\r\nHappily none of the bullets found its billet among the Royal Irish,\r\nwho were greatly praised by the military authorities for their\r\ngood behaviour, and the States (the local parliament) of Guernsey\r\npresented a hundred guineas to the non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates of the XVIIIth as a tangible proof of gratitude for their\r\nservices on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1783 the regiment sailed for Gibraltar, where it was\r\nstationed for the next ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1793-1817.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC: TOULON--CORSICA--EGYPT. THE\r\nNAPOLEONIC WAR: THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early phases of the French Revolution the British\r\nGovernment assumed an attitude of strict neutrality in the internal\r\naffairs of France, and to this policy it adhered until January,\r\n1793, when the excesses of the Jacobins, culminating in the judicial\r\nmurder of Louis XVI., compelled England to join the coalition of\r\nContinental Powers which had taken up arms to restore order in\r\nFrance, and to safeguard their own dominions, threatened, and in\r\nsome cases actually invaded by the troops of the Republic. The\r\noutbreak of war found the British army in a deplorable condition;\r\nit had in no way recovered from its disasters in America, and was\r\n“lax in its discipline, entirely without system and very weak in\r\nnumbers. Each colonel of a regiment managed it according to his\r\nnotions or neglected it altogether. There was no uniformity of drill\r\nor movement; professional pride was rare, professional knowledge\r\nstill more so.... Every department was more or less inefficient.\r\nThe regimental officers, as well as their men, were hard drinkers,\r\nthe latter, under a loose discipline were addicted to marauding and\r\nto acts of licentious violence.”[84] The _physique_ was often as\r\ndefective as the _morale_; some regiments were composed of lads too\r\nyoung to march, while in others the majority of the rank and file\r\nwere old and worn-out men. A few thousand troops were hurried off\r\nto join the forces of the Allies who faced the French in Holland,\r\nand a fleet was sent to the Mediterranean under Lord Hood, with\r\norders to co-operate with the adherents of the Monarchy, who were\r\nstill numerous in the south of France. After Hood passed Gibraltar\r\nhe bore up for Toulon, then as now one of the principal French naval\r\nports.[85] In its harbour and dockyard lay many warships, commanded\r\nby Royalists who hated the Revolution and all its works, and manned\r\nby sailors many of whom agreed with the political opinions of their\r\nofficers. As large numbers of the civilian population in the town\r\nshared his views, the Royalist admiral, in the hope of rescuing his\r\ncountry from the anarchy into which it was plunged, took the extreme\r\nstep of entering into negotiations with Hood for the occupation\r\nof the port by the British. The horror inspired by the Revolution\r\nmust have been deep indeed to induce an officer of high rank and\r\nunblemished reputation to think of such an arrangement with a nation\r\nregarded by every Frenchman as the hereditary enemy of his race.\r\nSince the Normans after conquering France had overrun and subdued\r\nEngland, hostilities between the two countries had been frequent,\r\nalmost incessant; we had often raided the French coasts, and for a\r\nlong time our kings held as their own the western half of France.\r\nIn the hundred years immediately preceding the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution the divergent policy of their rulers had plunged the two\r\ncountries into a series of five wars: their armies had encountered\r\neach other on innumerable battlefields in Germany and the Low\r\nCountries, in Spain, Canada and the West Indies: their fleets had met\r\nnot only in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and the Channel,\r\nbut in parts of the ocean as remote as the Gulf of Bengal and the\r\nCaribbean Sea; and bands of French adventurers in the service of the\r\nnative princes of India had fought with the troops of the East India\r\nCompany on the plains of Hindustan. Very bitter must have been the\r\nfeelings of the Royalist officers when they agreed to make over to\r\nHood the forts, the arsenal, the shipping, the docks, and the town of\r\nToulon itself, on the understanding that this national property was\r\nto be held in trust for the son of Louis XVI., to whom it was duly to\r\nbe restored when he ascended the throne. The French men-of-war were\r\nto be dismantled, but as a concession to sentiment, and to show that\r\nToulon was not a conquered town but still formed part of the Kingdom\r\nof France, the white flag of the Bourbons was to float over its walls.\r\n\r\nOn August 27, 1793, Hood, who had been joined by a Spanish squadron,\r\ntook possession of the forts. The landing party consisted of from\r\ntwelve to fifteen hundred marines and soldiers who were serving on\r\nboard the ships. There was no officer among them of rank higher than\r\na captain; they had no tents, or stores, or field-guns, and even had\r\nthey possessed the latter, there were no engineers or artillerymen\r\nto plan a battery or to lay a gun. Though the troops met with no\r\nactive opposition, the attitude of many of the French sailors was so\r\nthreatening that Hood decided to get rid of as many of them as he\r\ncould, and selecting four of the least serviceable French vessels,\r\nhe unshipped their guns and ammunition, and packed into them five\r\nthousand of the most troublesome republican seamen, with “safe\r\nconducts” for the French ports on the Atlantic seaboard. Having\r\nthus disposed of these “undesirables,” Hood applied to those of the\r\nAllied Powers whose territories lay in the basin of the Mediterranean\r\nfor help to hold Toulon against the Republicans who were gathering\r\nagainst him, and by the beginning of November he had collected a very\r\nheterogeneous force of about 16,000 men. When our Ministers learned\r\nthat Toulon was in the hands of the Allies they promised to send\r\nHood large reinforcements; but neither the importance of the place\r\nas a base of operations against the Republicans, nor the difficulty\r\nof holding its land-locked harbour were adequately appreciated at\r\nhome; and when more troops were required for our contingent in the\r\nLow Countries, for an expedition against the coast of Brittany,\r\nand for a raid upon the French islands in the West Indies, the\r\nexpected reinforcements dwindled to seven hundred and fifty men\r\nfrom Gibraltar, who reached Toulon on the 27th of October. At the\r\nbeginning of the war the regiments were so weak that this handful of\r\ntroops included the XVIIIth Royal Irish,[86] the second battalion of\r\nthe Royals, and detachments of Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery.\r\nThe exact strength of the XVIIIth is not known, but as on the 25th\r\nof June, 1793, there were only two hundred and eighty-three officers\r\nand men at the Rock, and as a certain number of sick were left in\r\nhospital when the Royal Irish went on active service, the captains\r\nmust have commanded companies no larger than the sections of the\r\npresent day. The reinforcements from Gibraltar raised the strength\r\nof the British to about 2000 of all ranks; their allies consisted of\r\n6500 Spaniards, 4700 Neapolitans, 1500 Piedmontese, and about the\r\nsame number of French Royalists.\r\n\r\nAn army made up of contingents from several nations is necessarily\r\nless effective than one formed of soldiers of the same race.\r\nHereditary ill-feeling, professional jealousy, and the want of a\r\ncommon language combine to lessen its value as a fighting machine,\r\nunless the General-in-Chief possesses a personality as commanding\r\nas that of Marlborough or Wellington. At Toulon none of the senior\r\nofficers of the Allies were men of genius, and it is doubtful whether\r\neven a great soldier, with so curiously composed a force, could have\r\nwithstood the savage energy that Napoleon, then a young officer of\r\nartillery on his first campaign, infused into the Generals commanding\r\nthe besieging troops. The contingents of the Allies were of very\r\nuneven value. The British were excellent, though their courage was\r\nnot yet thoroughly disciplined; the Piedmontese were very good; the\r\nFrench Royalists, though brave, naturally disliked to fight their\r\nrepublican fellow-countrymen, much as they loathed their political\r\nprinciples; the Spaniards frequently deserted their posts when\r\nthreatened by a vigorous attack, and the Neapolitans were cowards of\r\nthe deepest dye. Sir Gilbert Elliot, the diplomatic representative\r\nof Britain in the Mediterranean expedition, describes how a party of\r\nNeapolitans behaved on outpost. After four of them had been killed\r\nin a skirmish, the remainder sent to the officer in charge of the\r\nsection “to beg to be relieved as they were all _sick_!” With such\r\nallies it is not surprising to learn that “no post was considered\r\nsafe without a proportion of British troops, and they were obliged\r\nto be divided and thin-sowed accordingly.”[87] Whether from genuine\r\nillness, from unfitness for the hardships of active service, or\r\nfrom overwork, the sick list was enormous, and the Generals could\r\nnever count on more than 11,000 or 12,000 effectives--far too few\r\nfor the heavy duty they had to perform. To prevent the enemy from\r\nplanting batteries on the hills commanding the harbour, the Allies\r\nwere forced to hold a perimeter of fifteen miles, guarded by eight\r\nmain works with a number of subsidiary connecting posts; and nine\r\nthousand men were constantly employed at the outposts, with a reserve\r\nof three thousand in the town, to overawe the disaffected part of the\r\npopulation and to reinforce any threatened point.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the arrival of the XVIIIth there had not been much\r\nfighting, for the French were engaged in mounting guns, and were not\r\nyet in strength to attempt a _coup-de-main_. When the Royal Irish\r\nlanded they were marched up to the front, but were engaged in no\r\naffair of importance until the 30th of November, when they took part\r\nin a sortie against a large battery placed by Napoleon himself on the\r\nAresnes heights, from which one of our principal works was commanded.\r\nThe assaulting column, formed of 400 British, 300 Piedmontese, 600\r\nNeapolitans, 600 Spaniards, and 400 French Royalists, was commanded\r\nby General O’Hara, one of the staff at Gibraltar, who had landed at\r\nToulon with the XVIIIth. The instructions he issued were explicit.\r\nWhen the troops reached the plain at the foot of the heights, the\r\ncolumn was to break into four detachments, the British on the left,\r\nand on reaching the summit they were to capture the battery, occupy\r\nthe heights, and then stand fast; on no account whatever were they to\r\nfollow the enemy in pursuit. After making their way, first through a\r\nbelt of olive-trees intersected by stone walls, and then up a steep\r\nmountain cut into terraces of vineyards, the Allies gained the crest,\r\nsurprised the French, and drove them headlong out of the battery. Had\r\nthey remembered their orders the success would have been complete,\r\nfor the guns could have been rolled down the height and carried back\r\nto Toulon; but unfortunately the men got out of hand, and dashed\r\nmadly after the retreating French down a valley and up a hill on\r\nthe other side, scattering in all directions as they pursued their\r\nflying foes. They had lost all vestige of cohesion when they were\r\ncharged by formed bodies of the enemy, whose counter-stroke changed\r\nour victory into a defeat. General O’Hara was wounded and captured;\r\nand of the four hundred British engaged, twelve officers and about\r\ntwo hundred other ranks were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner.\r\nThe survivors fell back to the battery and attempted to hold it,\r\nbut being unsupported by their Continental comrades had finally to\r\nretreat into Toulon, though not before they had spiked six guns.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fortnight the volume of the enemy’s fire increased\r\ndaily; fresh batteries were unmasked in various directions, and\r\neverything tended to confirm the reports of spies and deserters that\r\nthe French, now about 40,000 strong, were preparing for an attack\r\nin force. The preliminary bombardment began at 2 A.M. on the 16th\r\nof December, when Napoleon concentrated the fire of five batteries\r\nupon Fort Mulgrave, one of the most important of the western series\r\nof redoubts. It was held by a mixed force: a body of Spaniards\r\noccupied the northern half of the work; the southern was in charge\r\nof a detachment of British, under Captain W. Conolly, Royal Irish\r\nRegiment. By the end of the day the redoubt was in ruins, with half\r\nits garrison of seven hundred men disabled; at two o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the 17th the French advanced against it, but though in\r\noverpowering force, for half an hour they made no progress till\r\nthe Spaniards were seized with panic and left the British in the\r\nlurch. The enemy had begun to occupy the northern end of the work,\r\nwhen Conolly, though himself hard pressed, sent a subaltern and\r\nthirty-six men to retake it. With splendid courage this handful of\r\nsoldiers drove back the Republicans, and for a time kept them at bay;\r\nbut soon the weight of numbers began to tell, the survivors of the\r\ndetachment were forced backwards, and at four o’clock the “remnants\r\nof the XVIIIth” were ousted from Fort Mulgrave. An hour or two later\r\nthe French, breaking through the line of fortifications at a second\r\npoint, carried Mont Faron, a hill 1800 feet high, which from the\r\nnorth partly commands the harbour and the town. On the enemy’s side\r\nof this mountain the slopes are steep and rocky; and as much labour\r\nhad been expended in increasing their natural difficulties, Faron\r\nwas considered so impregnable that only four hundred and fifty men\r\nwere employed to guard its two miles of frontage. At daylight every\r\nwork upon this hill was attacked and, though none of the British\r\nposts were driven in, the French poured through the gaps left by\r\nthe Spaniards and Neapolitans, and established themselves upon the\r\nshoulder of Mont Faron from which Toulon is overlooked.\r\n\r\nA disaster such as this had long been foreseen by the senior officers\r\nof the British land forces. General O’Hara, and his successor\r\nGeneral David Dundas, had frequently represented to Lord Hood the\r\nimpossibility of making a prolonged defence with so inadequate and\r\nso inefficient a garrison as that at his disposal; they had pointed\r\nout that if one of the main works should be lost there were no\r\nfresh troops with which to recapture it, and that once any part of\r\nthe line was pierced the harbour and the fleet would be exposed to\r\nthe enemy’s artillery; and they therefore urged that arrangements\r\nshould be made beforehand for the orderly and systematic evacuation\r\nof the place when it became untenable. But Lord Hood was strongly\r\nprejudiced against soldiers: throughout his career he had slighted\r\ntheir advice, and he took no steps to prepare for the retreat which\r\nthe Generals warned him was inevitable, with the result that when all\r\nhope of holding the place was gone nothing was in readiness for the\r\nretirement, and nearly the whole of the 17th was spent in settling\r\ndetails with the naval and military officers of the different\r\nnations. To organise the evacuation was no easy task; not only\r\nwere there four thousand sick and wounded to be embarked, but room\r\nhad to be found on the transports or the men-of-war for thousands\r\nof Royalists whom it was impossible to abandon to the vengeance\r\nof their republican fellow-countrymen; the French ships had to be\r\nburned or towed out of harbour, and the arsenal and dockyard to be\r\ndestroyed. After many hours of weary discussion it was agreed that\r\nthe embarkation of the troops should begin at 11 P.M. on the 18th;\r\nthe least important posts were to be withdrawn early, others were\r\nto be held to the last moment. The scheme, which required absolute\r\nobedience to orders, was nearly wrecked by the Neapolitans, whose\r\nmisconduct Elliot thus described in a despatch to Government--\r\n\r\n  “ ... These arrangements were made on the 17th before dinner.\r\n  Without notice to any person concerned the Neapolitan officers\r\n  packed up their baggage, and crowded the streets and quays with\r\n  their preparations for departing on the evening of the 17th.\r\n  Their baggage was actually sent on board, their general actually\r\n  embarked that evening, and the troops, quitting every post where\r\n  they were stationed, continued their embarcation publicly from\r\n  the quays of the town, from the evening of the 17th to the middle\r\n  of the next day. Their eagerness, impatience and panic were so\r\n  great on the 18th, in the forenoon, that the embarcation of the\r\n  inhabitants was rendered not only difficult but dangerous, the\r\n  Neapolitan soldiers firing on those boats which they could not\r\n  get admission to. Many of themselves were drowned in attempting\r\n  to crowd into the boats, and there was a temporary appearance of\r\n  confusion and insurrection in the town. The Neapolitan Admiral\r\n  seems to have been in as great haste as the military. He sailed\r\n  long before either the British or Spanish squadrons and, without\r\n  waiting to make any arrangement about either troops or refugees,\r\n  pushed off for Naples, leaving a good number of Neapolitan\r\n  troops on board our fleet to find their way home as well as they\r\n  can.”[88]\r\n\r\nUntil nearly all the allied troops were embarked the British and\r\nPiedmontese remained resolutely at their posts, which they did\r\nnot quit until recalled into the town to cover the operations of\r\nthe sailors, who were burning the arsenal and setting fire to the\r\nFrench ships. When the outposts were withdrawn the French crowded\r\ninto Toulon, and by the light of the flames shot heavily at the\r\nblue-jackets, busy at the work of devastation, in which they were\r\nhelped by a party of the XVIIIth, commanded by Ensign W. Iremonger,\r\none of the two land officers employed on this dangerous duty. For a\r\ntime a musketry fight raged; then at the appointed hour the soldiers\r\ngradually withdrew to their boats, gained their ships, and in two\r\nor three hours the whole of the allied fleet was safely out to sea.\r\nThough Hood’s operations on land utterly failed to advance the\r\ncause of the Royalists, and though he did not succeed in destroying\r\nthe arsenal completely, or in burning all the enemy’s ships, he\r\nundoubtedly inflicted a serious, though not a crushing blow to the\r\nnaval power of France in the Mediterranean by his operations at\r\nToulon. When he took possession of the town he found floating in\r\nits harbour or building in its dockyard fifty-eight men-of-war of\r\nvarious sizes: thirty-three he annexed or burned to the water’s\r\nedge, the remaining twenty-five he was obliged to leave behind him,\r\nto become the nucleus of a new fleet. The price paid in human flesh\r\nand blood for this success cannot be stated, for the losses of the\r\nAllies are not to be traced, and the British returns, as far as\r\nthey were published in despatches, are incomplete, and in the case\r\nof the Royal Irish do not agree with the muster-roll made a week\r\nafter the evacuation. In it appear the names of three sergeants, one\r\ncorporal, and thirty-four privates who were killed or died during the\r\nsiege; and one officer, Lieutenant George Minchin, two sergeants,\r\ntwo drummers, one corporal, and thirty-two privates missing.[89] In\r\nthe unsuccessful sortie of the 30th of November twenty-four rank and\r\nfile of the regiment were wounded; how many were injured in the daily\r\nfighting at the outposts and in the defence of Fort Mulgrave and Mont\r\nFaron cannot be ascertained, but it is clear that the Royal Irish\r\nplayed a distinguished part in the operations, and in proportion to\r\ntheir numbers lost very heavily.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the allied fleet was clear of the harbour of Toulon it\r\ndispersed: the Spaniards and the Neapolitans made sail respectively\r\nfor the Balearic Isles and Naples, while Hood put into the bay of\r\nHyères, a few miles east of Toulon, where he tried to evolve order\r\nout of the chaos produced by the hurried embarkation of the troops,\r\nand to obtain fresh provisions of which he was in great need.\r\nUnwilling to weaken himself by sending British vessels to buy food in\r\nthe ports of Italy and Spain, he employed upon this service several\r\nof the French ships, which, in theory at least, were still under the\r\norders of the Royalist admiral. British infantry were sent on board\r\nthem as marines, the XVIIIth furnishing a strong detachment under\r\nLieutenant Mawby, who on going on board the _Pompée_ found that she\r\nwas still flying the Royalist flag, and was commanded by French\r\nnaval officers. The duty was heavy, and the cruise must have been\r\na very unpleasant one, for guards had to be mounted in every part\r\nof the vessel to keep her crew from breaking into open mutiny. In\r\none respect, however, Mawby and his companions were better off than\r\ntheir comrades at headquarters, for they escaped the overcrowding\r\ncaused by the presence of thousands of Royalists in the ships at\r\nHyères. Sir Gilbert Elliot mentions that in the cabin he shared\r\nwith several naval officers, twenty luckless French refugees, men,\r\nwomen, and children slept huddled together on the floor; and if no\r\nbetter quarters could be provided for the diplomatic representative\r\nof England, it is easy to imagine that regimental officers must have\r\nbeen hideously uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAt this time England had no possessions in the Mediterranean east\r\nof Gibraltar, for Minorca, lost to her in 1782, was not recovered\r\ntill some years later. Yet to watch Toulon and the southern coast\r\nof France, and to encourage the various Italian States to fight for\r\ntheir independence which was already threatened by the armies of the\r\nRepublic, it was essential that England should possess an advanced\r\nnaval and military base in the Mediterranean. Such a post awaited us\r\nin Corsica, where the inhabitants had profited by the turmoil of the\r\nRevolution to rise against their French masters, whom they had driven\r\ninto the north of the island. The garrison had flung themselves into\r\nthe fortified coast towns of Bastia and Calvi, and the works fringing\r\nthe bay of S. Fiorenzo, and the Corsicans soon realised that without\r\nprofessional soldiers, cannon, and munitions of war, they could not\r\nhope to take these places, while without a fleet it was impossible to\r\nprevent reinforcements from the mainland reaching their enemy. When\r\nboth parties to a bargain are eager to come to terms negotiations\r\nare easy, and the islanders willingly agreed to become subjects of\r\nGeorge III., provided that a constitution framed on that of England\r\nwas granted to them. As soon as the arrangements for the annexation\r\nof the island were completed Hood left his anchorage at Hyères, where\r\nfor five weeks the French had allowed him to remain unmolested, and\r\nmade for the bay of S. Fiorenzo, at the western base of the great\r\nnorthern promontory of Corsica.[90] Driving the French from their\r\ndefences, he forced them to fall back on Bastia, their foothold on\r\nthe eastern coast; then leaving some of the troops at S. Fiorenzo,\r\nhe sailed for Bastia, already closely blockaded by Nelson’s frigates\r\nand cut off from communication with the interior by the Corsicans,\r\nwho excelled in all kinds of partisan warfare. Neither Hood’s ships\r\nnor the troops accompanying them were at this time in a satisfactory\r\ncondition: his crews were so weak that he had tried to borrow sailors\r\nfrom the Neapolitan fleet, but without success; and the soldiers\r\nnumbered little more than two thousand men, who were very ill\r\nprovided for a campaign, as most of their camp equipage, baggage, and\r\nknapsacks had been left behind at Toulon. A board sat in Corsica to\r\ninvestigate the circumstances in which this loss--a very heavy one to\r\nthe men--had been incurred, and recommended that £2 should be paid\r\nto each sergeant and £1 to each private soldier, adding that though\r\nthis would not compensate the men for their kit, it was as much as\r\nGovernment could be reasonably expected to give.\r\n\r\nThough Hood, as a sailor, was unversed in the military branches of\r\nthe art of war, he decided after a reconnaissance of Bastia that it\r\nwould be possible for the troops to carry the defences by a sudden\r\nassault from the land side of the town. Dundas, who though cautious\r\nby temperament was an educated soldier of much experience, condemned\r\nthe project as beyond the powers of his small and ill-equipped force,\r\nand this difference of opinion at once intensified the friction\r\nalready existing between the Admiral and the General. Unable to\r\nagree on a plan of operations, Hood and Dundas summoned conferences\r\nand councils of war, at which no decision was reached; and their\r\nrelations became so strained that they ceased to meet, transacting\r\nbusiness by means of formal and acrimonious correspondence.\r\nThroughout the army the question was hotly debated, and Bastia was\r\nreconnoitred by many officers, the large majority of whom became\r\nconverts to Dundas’s opinions. Lieutenant-Colonel Wemyss, who\r\ncommanded the XVIIIth, was one of the few in favour of an attack,\r\nbut his views do not appear to have been supported by convincing\r\narguments, for Sir John Moore (then Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, 51st\r\nregiment) recorded in his diary that “Wemyss conceives it would be\r\nmighty easy to take them” (_i.e._, the heights commanding the land\r\nfortifications), “but cannot explain how, and talks so like a boy\r\nthat little weight can be given to his opinion.”[91] Hood’s conduct\r\ntowards the General and the troops became so intolerable that Dundas\r\ntook the unjustifiable step of resigning his command and returning\r\nto England. Not long after his departure reinforcements reached the\r\nofficer in temporary command of the army, whose offer to co-operate\r\nin the operations was contemptuously rejected by Lord Hood; and\r\nthus, when on May 24th the garrison of 4500 men surrendered, the\r\nsuccess was due to the Navy, whose blockading vessels had fairly\r\nstarved the French into submission, while, with the exception of some\r\nartillerymen and the troops serving on the warships as marines, the\r\nland forces were hardly employed in the reduction of Bastia.\r\n\r\nThe only place in Corsica now remaining in the occupation of the\r\nFrench was Calvi, a well-fortified town on the western coast.\r\nLieutenant-General the Hon. Charles Stuart, who on the day of the\r\nsurrender of Bastia had arrived from England to replace Dundas, lost\r\nno time in reorganising his command, and then reconnoitred Calvi,\r\nwhere he was followed by Moore, who had been placed in command of a\r\ncorps termed “the reserve,” and formed of the flank companies of the\r\nRoyal Irish, the 50th, 51st, and the remains of the 2nd battalion\r\nof the Royals. Calvi was by no means an easy place to besiege, for\r\nit was surrounded on three sides by the sea and had good interior\r\nfortifications, with outer works of considerable strength. About\r\neight hundred yards west of the town stood the Mozello, a bomb-proof,\r\nstar-shaped fort, built of solid masonry and mounting ten guns; north\r\nof this fort was a smaller battery, flanked by an entrenchment,\r\nand to the east rose another battery of three guns. Two thousand\r\nyards south-west of the town the fort of Monteciesco commanded the\r\napproaches from the southward, which were also swept by the guns of\r\ntwo French frigates anchored in the bay. But though these works were\r\nformidable, Stuart considered that the “real strength of the defence\r\nlay in the height of the mountains and the rugged, rocky country over\r\nwhich it was necessary to penetrate. It was necessary to abandon\r\nregular approaches and to adopt rapid and forward movements.” He\r\naccordingly decided to bombard Fort Monteciesco with three 26-prs.,\r\nand under cover of their fire to throw up a heavier battery at night\r\nwithin seven hundred and fifty yards of the Mozello. The labour of\r\nmoving the guns, ammunition, and stores was immense, for roads had to\r\nbe cut up the sides of steep hills nine hundred feet in height, and\r\nthe cannon to be dragged by hand over the cliffs that overhang the\r\nlanding-place. At the end of June more troops were brought round from\r\nBastia; among them were the Royal Irish, recently reinforced by the\r\nreturn of the _Pompée_ detachment, which rejoined in time to share in\r\nthe fatigues and dangers of the siege.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 6th of July,[92] the Royal Irish were ordered\r\nto make a feigned attack on Monteciesco to draw the attention of\r\nthe enemy from Moore’s column, which was preparing to throw up the\r\nbattery against the Mozello. The ruse was successful; the XVIIIth\r\nshowed themselves so ostentatiously that the French not only turned\r\nall their fire upon them, but reinforced Monteciesco with a body\r\nof men who had been posted on the very spot where Moore proposed\r\nto place his guns. By dint of great efforts the last of Moore’s\r\n26-prs. was dragged into position just before daybreak, thus raising\r\nthe number of ordnance playing upon Calvi to eleven guns and three\r\nmortars, whose fire forced the French to evacuate Monteciesco and\r\nmove their warships out of range. Stuart then bombarded Mozello\r\nassiduously; the French replied with equal vigour; for some days our\r\nshot appeared to make little impression on the fort, but on the 18th\r\nof July the breach was reported to be practicable, and orders were\r\nissued for its assault that night. To conceal the real object of\r\nhis movements, he arranged that an advance battery should be built\r\nin the night in order that the French might think the concentration\r\nof troops was merely for the protection of the working party. The\r\ntask was entrusted to the 50th, who, undiscovered by the enemy,\r\nthrew up the battery, and then, to quote the words of the despatch,\r\n“the Grenadiers, Light Infantry and 2nd Battalion Royals under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Moore of the 51st Regiment and Major Brereton\r\nof the 30th Regiment proceeded with a cool steady confidence and\r\nunloaded arms towards the enemy, forced their way through a smart\r\nfire of musketry, and regardless of live shells flung from the\r\nbreach or the additional defence of pikes, stormed the Mozello” ...\r\nwhile “Lieutenant-Colonel Wemyss, equally regardless of opposition\r\ncarried the enemy’s battery on the left without firing a shot.” In\r\nSir John Moore’s diary fuller details of this spirited affair are\r\nto be found. The various corps assembled at their rendezvous at\r\n1 A.M. on the 19th: the Royal Irish were to attack the half moon\r\n(or Fountain) battery on the left, while “the reserve” stormed the\r\nMozello. In ground dead to the fort, though only two or three hundred\r\nyards distant from it, Moore formed the grenadiers and light infantry\r\n(among whom, it will be remembered, were the flank companies of the\r\nXVIIIth) into a column of companies.\r\n\r\n  “Each grenadier carried a sandbag, and we had a sufficient number\r\n  of ladders (about fourteen in all). Here we waited for the signal\r\n  which was to be a gun from the new battery. The General came to\r\n  me about half-past three. About this time some of the enemy’s\r\n  sentries or piquets fired upon the XVIIIth upon our left, and\r\n  soon after the signal to advance was given. The General kept for\r\n  some time at the head of the Grenadiers. A party of artificers a\r\n  little in our front began to cut the palisades, but we were upon\r\n  them before they could effect it. Captain McDonald, who commanded\r\n  the Royal Grenadiers,[93] and I got through the palisades first\r\n  at an opening made by our shot. The men instantly followed, and\r\n  giving a cheer, ran up to the bottom of the breach. We were\r\n  annoyed both by shot, hand-grenades, and live shells, which the\r\n  enemy had placed on the parapet and rolled over upon us. Luckily\r\n  neither sand-bags nor ladders were necessary. The Grenadiers\r\n  advanced with their bayonets with such intrepidity that the\r\n  French gave way and ran out of the fort--and in a moment the\r\n  place was filled with the five companies of Grenadiers. Two\r\n  companies of Light Infantry had been ordered to move quickly\r\n  round the foot of the fort and get between the enemy and the\r\n  town, but the Grenadiers stormed so briskly that the Light\r\n  Infantry could not arrive in time: by this means most of them\r\n  escaped.”\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish lost no time in entrenching themselves in the\r\nFountain battery, and worked so well that when at daybreak the enemy\r\nopened with grape and round shot the cannonade did them little harm.\r\n\r\nStuart had every reason for wishing to bring the operations to a\r\nclose, for though his casualties were small, bad food, excessive\r\nfatigue, and a pestilential climate had so devastated the camp that\r\nby the middle of July two-thirds of his men were in hospital, and the\r\nremainder were breaking down at an alarming rate. The large number\r\nof sailors who were serving on shore under Nelson were in equally\r\nbad case, and the necessity of watching the French at Toulon made\r\nit impossible to replace them from the fleet. In the hope that the\r\nloss of their principal outworks had shaken the spirit of the French,\r\nGeneral Stuart sent word to the garrison that he was prepared to\r\noffer them favourable terms; but when Casabianca, their commander,\r\nrefused to negotiate, he pressed forward his siege-works so fast that\r\non July 31, thirteen heavy guns, four mortars, and three howitzers\r\nwere in position within six hundred yards of the walls of the town.\r\nSo effective was their fire that on the 1st of August Casabianca\r\nasked for a suspension of hostilities, undertaking to yield in nine\r\ndays if during that time he was not relieved from France, and as no\r\nhelp arrived the nine hundred men of the garrison surrendered on\r\nthe 10th. In recognition of their spirited defence of Calvi, which\r\nhad lasted for fifty-one days, they were granted excellent terms;\r\nthey marched out with all the honours of war; they retained their\r\nside-arms; and they were sent back to France, free to serve against\r\nus again as soon as they pleased. The capture of Calvi only cost the\r\nBritish ninety killed and wounded, and the losses of the XVIIIth were\r\nproportionately small. Lieutenant W. Byron, whose death assured to\r\nhis young relative, the future poet, the succession to the peerage,\r\nwas killed; Lieutenant-Colonel D. D. Wemyss and Lieutenant W.\r\nJohnston were wounded; five rank and file were killed, one sergeant\r\nand seven rank and file wounded.[94] Yet so greatly had the regiment\r\nsuffered during the siege from exposure and malarial fever, that when\r\nit marched into Calvi its effectives consisted of two officers, four\r\nsergeants, and seventy-one rank and file, and though the capitulation\r\nbrought active operations to an end the losses by disease did not\r\ncease. Malaria had taken so firm a hold of the Royal Irish that\r\nincluding those who were killed or died of wounds or sickness during\r\nthe siege, four officers, nine sergeants, six corporals, and a\r\nhundred and fifty-five private soldiers perished during the first\r\nnine months the regiment was in Corsica.[95] The mortality was at\r\nits height during the month of August, when seventy non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men died.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the doings of the XVIIIth during the remainder\r\nof our short occupation of Corsica, except that several of the\r\nofficers were employed on the staff: one of them, Major (afterwards\r\nLieutenant-General Sir H. T.) Montresor, after acting as Governor\r\nof Calvi, was placed in command of a battalion of islanders, one\r\nof the corps raised for local defence by Sir Gilbert Elliot, who\r\nhad been appointed Viceroy of Corsica by the Government at home.\r\nThe lives of the officers left at regimental duty must have been\r\nsingularly dull, as there was so little communication with England\r\nthat letters or papers rarely reached the island, and even the\r\nMinistry, apparently forgetful of the existence of their new\r\npossession, often allowed months to pass without communicating with\r\nElliot. Some amount of cynical amusement, however, was to be derived\r\nfrom studying the mental attitude of the population, who, at first\r\ndelighted to find themselves British subjects, soon grew weary of the\r\nrestraints of law and order enforced upon them by their new rulers.\r\nThe Corsicans watched with ever increasing pride the victories in\r\nItaly of their young compatriot, Napoleon Bonaparte; they realised\r\nthat the English and their Allies made no headway against France\r\non land, and they appreciated the importance of Spain’s change of\r\npolicy, when after deserting the coalition against the Republic she\r\nplaced her Mediterranean fleet at the disposal of our enemy. They\r\ngradually came to the conclusion that in annexing themselves to the\r\nBritish they had joined the losing side, and when the French troops\r\noverran Tuscany and seized upon Leghorn, the Corsicans began to give\r\nElliot broad hints that they wished to see the last of him and his\r\ngarrison of red-coats. The presence of the French in Leghorn, the\r\nprincipal port of Tuscany, was a direct menace to us in Corsica;\r\nand as a counterstroke Elliot threw troops into Porto Ferraio, the\r\ncapital of the little island of Elba, half way between Bastia and\r\nLeghorn. To the Duke of Tuscany, part of whose dominions Elliot had\r\nthus occupied, the Viceroy justified himself by pointing out that as\r\nTuscany had been unable to defend her territory on the mainland she\r\nwould have been equally impotent to keep the French out of Elba.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1796, the British Government, alarmed at the\r\ncombination of the French and Spanish fleets, determined to\r\nrecall their forces from the Mediterranean, and the order for the\r\nevacuation of Corsica was conveyed to Elliot by a despatch, wherein\r\nthe abandonment of the island was described in the stilted language\r\nof the period as “the withdrawal of the blessing of the British\r\nConstitution from the people of Corsica.” As a preliminary to the\r\ngeneral retirement the troops had to be concentrated at Elba; and the\r\nembarkation of the garrison of Bastia, which included some, if not\r\nall, of the Royal Irish, was effected in very dramatic circumstances.\r\nWhen Nelson arrived off the port on October 14, he found the town\r\nin wild confusion: a committee of virulent Anglophobists had seized\r\nthe reins of power, and their adherents were virtually masters of\r\nthe place; British property had been confiscated; British merchant\r\nships were forcibly detained in harbour; a plot was on foot to make\r\nthe Viceroy a prisoner, and the General, de Burgh, had withdrawn the\r\ngarrison into the citadel, where they had been followed by large\r\nnumbers of armed men who insisted on falling in with the guards and\r\nsentries at every post. By threatening to blow the town to pieces,\r\nNelson succeeded in releasing the captured shipping and in saving\r\npublic and private property valued at two hundred thousand pounds;\r\nbut though the soldiers and sailors slaved night and day their\r\nwork was by no means finished when, on the night of the 18th, news\r\narrived that French troops had landed and were marching rapidly on\r\nBastia, while the Spanish fleet was reported to be only sixty miles\r\ndistant. Even Nelson realised that nothing more could be done: the\r\ntroops began to move down to the boats, while the guns were spiked\r\nby Mawby, an officer of the XVIIIth, who with the grenadier company\r\nof the regiment had just been brought back from detachment on the\r\nneighbouring islet of Capreja. Though a heavy gale of wind was\r\nblowing and the sea was very high every soldier was safely embarked;\r\nand not too soon, for as the last boat pushed off from the shore the\r\nFrench advance-guard began to enter the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Elba were insufficient to meet the requirements of\r\nher suddenly increased population, and at first she drew largely\r\nfrom Piombino, the port of the district known as the Maremma of\r\nTuscany. By garrisoning the town of Piombino and the villages in\r\nits neighbourhood, the French so effectually cut off this source\r\nof supply that at the beginning of November Elliot and de Burgh\r\ndetermined to make an effort to reopen communication with the\r\nmainland of Italy, and sent a column, chiefly composed of the\r\nRoyal Irish, to drive the enemy from Piombino and the surrounding\r\ncountry.[96] The expedition is briefly mentioned by the Viceroy in\r\na letter of November 6, 1796, where he says, “We take Piombino this\r\nevening. This will be the last act of my reign, and in truth the\r\nmeasure of Porto Ferraio was not complete without it. I shall then\r\nfeel very happy about our supplies.”[97] No account of the operations\r\nis to be found in the printed bulletins or among the documents at the\r\nRecord Office; but fortunately some details have been preserved in\r\nthe Royal Military Calendar, in a précis of the services of General\r\nMontresor. Brevet-Colonel D. D. Wemyss, XVIIIth, was in command\r\nof the column which was composed of the Royal Irish,[98] under\r\nMontresor, then a lieutenant-colonel; two companies of de Roll’s\r\nSwiss regiment, one of the many corps of continental mercenaries\r\nraised at that time by Great Britain, and a detachment of artillery.\r\nThese troops were embarked on three frigates, which anchored off\r\nPiombino early on November 7; Montresor was at once sent on shore to\r\nsummon the Governor, who after some hesitation agreed to surrender,\r\nand without loss of time the soldiers landed. While Wemyss was\r\ntaking measures to secure Piombino and to improvise transport for\r\nhis men his heart must have sunk within him. Outside the walls of\r\nthe town there were hardly any signs of life; autumnal rains had\r\nflooded the country in every direction; a few stone buildings, half\r\nfarm, half fortress, rose like islands out of the water; thick\r\nwoods concealed the villages on the neighbouring hills, whither for\r\ncenturies the inhabitants of the Maremma have betaken themselves at\r\nnight to avoid sleeping on the fever-stricken plain. After a few\r\nhours’ hard work Montresor, with a detachment of five hundred men\r\nand three field-guns, marched to attack the garrison of Campiglia, a\r\nvillage ten miles off. The country was inundated for three miles, but\r\n\r\n  “the hedges and trees on either side of the road being their\r\n  guide the British waded through, though the buffalos attached\r\n  to their guns had twice knocked up. On approaching the town the\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel sent his light company under Captain Dunlop\r\n  by another road to cut off the enemy’s picquets from the town,\r\n  and to enter it by the Leghorn road, both of which were executed;\r\n  after exchanging a few shots with the enemy’s outposts, finding\r\n  the British in their rear, they were compelled to disperse\r\n  in the woods, which left the town open to complete surprise,\r\n  inasmuch, that in front of his advance guard, at one o’clock\r\n  after midnight, Lieut.-Colonel Montresor got into the town with\r\n  a confidential servant unperceived, and personally seized an\r\n  orderly French dragoon going with despatches to the garrison of\r\n  Castiglione from the Commandant of Campiglia to announce the\r\n  British having landed at Piombino: the entrance to the town was\r\n  conducted with so much silence and arrangement that the Royal\r\n  Irish Grenadiers reached the French main guard just as the enemy\r\n  were turning out under arms, and rushing on them compelled them\r\n  to lay down their arms, while the Commandant, (whose quarters\r\n  were over the main guard), escaped by dropping out of his window\r\n  over the town walls, leaving his supper, (which he had deferred\r\n  to this late hour) on the table, and which was finished by the\r\n  British officers when the prisoners were secured and the British\r\n  patrols and picquets had been placed.\r\n\r\n  “Colonel Wemyss having proceeded to attack Castiglione,\r\n  Lieut.-Colonel Montresor secured his post so effectually that\r\n  during three months the strong garrison of Leghorn never molested\r\n  them. This little expedition being effectually accomplished, and\r\n  the troops of Elba having formed their depôts, the British force\r\n  was ordered back to Elba.”\r\n\r\nMuch had happened while the Royal Irish were on the mainland of\r\nItaly. In November the fleet had been obliged to go to Gibraltar for\r\nstores, and at the end of the year Nelson had reappeared at Elba\r\nwith orders from the Admiral, Sir John Jervis (afterwards Lord St\r\nVincent), to embark the naval establishment and rejoin him in the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar. Nelson, however, brought no instructions for\r\nde Burgh, and when he suggested that as the Navy had abandoned the\r\nMediterranean it was useless for the troops to remain in Elba, the\r\nbrave old general, though much perplexed at the situation, decided\r\nnot to quit his post without orders from his military superiors.\r\nNelson therefore had no option but to abandon de Burgh and his\r\nthree thousand troops to their fate, and leaving transports enough\r\nfor the whole of the garrison, and a few vessels with which to\r\nkeep up communication with the mainland, he rejoined Jervis early\r\nin February, 1797. But neither Jervis nor Nelson forgot that a\r\ndetachment of the British army was marooned in a little island off\r\nthe coast of Tuscany in imminent danger of capture by the French, and\r\nsoon after the great naval victory of Cape St Vincent, Nelson dashed\r\nback into the Mediterranean, ascertained that de Burgh and his troops\r\nwere safe, and convoyed them safely to Gibraltar. The Royal Irish\r\nlanded at the end of April or the beginning of May,[99] and formed\r\npart of the garrison of the Rock until, two years later, they again\r\nwere embarked for active service.\r\n\r\nThough the failure of the expedition to Holland in the winter of\r\n1799 had added one more to the list of our unsuccessful enterprises\r\nagainst the French on the continent of Europe, the spring of 1800\r\nfound preparations on foot in England for another effort on land\r\nagainst the Republic. Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby,\r\nwith twenty thousand men, was to disembark on the coast of Italy\r\nnear Genoa, occupy the maritime Alps, and by cutting the lines of\r\ncommunication between Italy and France relieve the pressure on the\r\nAustrians, who faced the French on the plains of Lombardy. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the fear of a Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal\r\nand the consequent loss of the Tagus as a friendly port, a large\r\nproportion of Abercromby’s force was kept back to defend Lisbon in\r\ncase of need, and when Sir Ralph reached Port Mahon, the capital of\r\nMinorca, which since its recapture in 1798 had become our advanced\r\npost in the Mediterranean, he had only six thousand men available\r\nfor active operations. He found despatches awaiting him from General\r\nMelas, the Austrian Commander-in-Chief in Italy, begging that British\r\ntroops might be sent to Genoa, which, after a heroic defence by the\r\nFrench under Massena, had recently surrendered to the Austrians.\r\nMelas himself was unable to garrison it adequately: would Abercromby\r\ntherefore do so? Ordering four thousand men, among whom were the\r\nXVIIIth Royal Irish, 571 strong, to follow him, Abercromby sailed\r\nat once, but on the voyage learned that at Marengo Napoleon had\r\ndefeated the Austrians, who were retreating all along their line, and\r\nhad evacuated Genoa. After definitely ascertaining that co-operation\r\nwith Melas had become impossible, he returned to Minorca, where for\r\nmany weeks the expedition awaited fresh orders from home. During\r\nthe halt Abercromby, with the help of Moore who commanded one of\r\nhis brigades, devoted himself to the improvement of the troops. He\r\nstrengthened their discipline, made their equipment suitable for\r\nactive service, and cut down the personal baggage of officers and\r\nmen to the articles absolutely necessary for a campaign. While he\r\nwas at Minorca reinforcements gradually reached him, including a\r\nbody of three thousand eight hundred men who had been on the point\r\nof attacking Belle Isle, off the western coast of France, when they\r\nwere hurriedly diverted to the Mediterranean. Thus, when at the end\r\nof August instructions reached him to make a raid against the Spanish\r\nport of Cadiz, Abercromby, after providing an adequate garrison for\r\nMinorca, was able to embark between ten and eleven thousand men.\r\n\r\nA fortnight was spent on the voyage to Gibraltar, where on\r\nSeptember 19, he was joined by a large number of troops under\r\nLieutenant-General Sir James Pulteney, the Colonel of the Royal\r\nIrish regiment.[100] Pulteney had been sent from England to destroy\r\nFerrol, a naval station on the north-west coast of Spain. He had\r\nlanded, driven the Spaniards back to the shelter of their works, and\r\nthen discovered that the Government had sent him on a fool’s errand.\r\nFerrol was well armed and fortified, and as he was not nearly strong\r\nenough to attack it, he wisely abandoned the enterprise, re-embarked\r\nhis men, and made sail for the Rock of Gibraltar.[101] Thanks to\r\nPulteney’s arrival, Abercromby’s command now consisted of about\r\ntwenty thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry and artillerymen,\r\nand in a few days a fleet of a hundred and thirty British men-of-war\r\nand troop-ships appeared before Cadiz, the most important naval\r\nharbour in the south of Spain. In the conduct of this expedition\r\nthe General had by no means a free hand, for the Ministry, while\r\nordering him to attack Cadiz, seize the arsenal, and destroy its\r\ndocks and shipping, emphatically enjoined upon him not to run much\r\nrisk, and not to land his troops unless he was confident that he\r\ncould re-embark them safely. Operations conducted on such lines were\r\ndoomed to failure. After much discussion with the naval authorities,\r\na few thousand troops, including the XVIIIth, were crowded into boats\r\nand started for the shore, only to be recalled in a few minutes\r\nto their respective vessels, for the Admiral finally declined to\r\nguarantee their safe return to the ships if once they landed. After\r\na fruitless paper war between Abercromby and his naval colleague\r\nthe whole fleet made sail, successful only in having covered itself\r\nwith ridicule. In a few hours a great storm arose: the ships were\r\ndriven in every direction along the coast of Morocco, where for many\r\ndays they tossed and rolled in a tempestuous sea until the weather\r\nmoderated and they reached Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nDuring this storm, and indeed during the whole of the many months\r\nthat Abercromby’s command spent on board ship, the sufferings of the\r\ntroops were great. The transports were so leaky that when it rained\r\nthe men were constantly wet; so crowded that there was often not room\r\non the decks for all to lie down at the same time; so ill-provided\r\nthat the soldiers had no bedding, no covering other than their\r\nregimental blankets if, indeed, they were lucky enough to possess\r\nsuch articles. The food was not only indifferent, but inadequate, for\r\nan idea prevailed that the ration issued on shore was enough for a\r\nman who was taking hard exercise, and therefore on board ship, where\r\nthe soldier theoretically was a passenger with nothing to do, he\r\nrequired less to eat than on land. In practice the soldier on board\r\na transport had to work as hard as a sailor, and consequently was\r\nunderfed. His diet of salt pork and biscuit, his ration of water,\r\noften scanty and generally tasting strongly of the barrels in which\r\nit was stored, and the absence of vegetables all combined to reduce\r\nhis strength, and he often fell a prey to the scurvy which in those\r\ndays devastated the fleet.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiers were still in the Straits of Gibraltar, where,\r\nas a sea-sick officer wrote, “the tossing of the ship rendered\r\nour situation as landsmen at once inconvenient and ridiculous,”\r\nAbercromby received despatches of great importance. Dundas, the\r\nWar Minister of England, had become inspired with a great idea--to\r\nabandon the “policy of pin-pricks” by which the conduct of our\r\ncampaigns in Europe had been hitherto regulated, and strike a\r\nblow in defence of the Empire as a whole. The year after we had\r\nabandoned Elba Napoleon had embarked in the south of France with\r\nforty thousand men, and after seizing Malta made himself master of\r\nEgypt and sent emissaries to India, whose intrigues among the native\r\nprinces complicated our situation in the East.[102] When he returned\r\nto France in 1799 he left behind him an army of occupation, whose\r\npresence was a continual danger to our power in Hindustan. This army\r\nDundas determined to drive out, and with the reluctant assent of the\r\nother members of the Cabinet he now ordered Abercromby to prepare for\r\na campaign in Lower Egypt, while a column, formed of a regiment from\r\nCape Colony[103] and of British and native troops from India, was to\r\nland at Kosseir on the Red Sea, strike across the desert to Upper\r\nEgypt, descend the Nile, and fall upon the enemy from the rear.[104]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of the French garrison in Malta on September 5, 1800,\r\nplaced the island at our disposal, and this, our latest conquest,\r\nwas fixed as the rendezvous of the fleet, which arrived there in\r\ndetachments from Gibraltar throughout November. While his troops\r\nrested the General strove, though with poor results, to supplement\r\nthe scanty information about the topography and resources of Egypt\r\nvouchsafed to him by Dundas, who had provided him with nothing but\r\nan indifferent map of the country and copies of correspondence of\r\ndoubtful value, intercepted between the French generals at Cairo\r\nand their official superiors in Paris. Abercromby, however, learned\r\nenough to convince him that without plenty of small craft of light\r\ndraught he could not land anywhere in Egypt, and on the 20th of\r\nDecember he weighed anchor for the Bay of Marmorice--a deep inlet on\r\nthe coast of Caramania, one of the provinces of Asia Minor belonging\r\nto the Sultan, who was co-operating with England in the Egyptian\r\nexpedition. Here the General expected to obtain shipping, and the\r\nhorses with which his cavalry and artillery were still unprovided,\r\nbut when after a tempestuous voyage he reached his destination on\r\nJanuary 2, 1801, he found the Turkish officials so dilatory that\r\nhe was forced to spend six weeks at Marmorice. Never was time more\r\nusefully employed, however, than during this long halt. The troops\r\nlanded, drilled, collected a great store of firewood for use in\r\nEgypt, and prepared gabions and fascines for siege operations.\r\nThe ships’ carpenters were occupied in making small water-kegs\r\nand canteens, and light wooden sleighs to be drawn by hand across\r\nthe desert. Both services were constantly practised in the art of\r\ndisembarkation, and before the fleet again put to sea the soldiers\r\ncould swarm down the sides of the transports and take their places in\r\nthe boats without confusion; while the sailors who rowed the flotilla\r\nhad learned to keep station and to reach the shore in the prescribed\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIn conceiving the idea of the expedition to Egypt Dundas apparently\r\nthought he had done all that could be expected from him, and took\r\nno trouble about details. He failed to comply with Abercromby’s\r\nrequisitions for stores and _matériel_. He did not even send him the\r\nbullion for which Sir Ralph frequently petitioned, and left him so\r\nshort of actual cash that for three months the army was unpaid, and\r\nthe only way by which cavalry horses could be bought at Marmorice was\r\nwith specie produced by well-to-do officers. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that Abercromby wrote, “We are now on the point of sailing\r\nfor the coast of Egypt with very slender means for executing the\r\norders we have received. I never went on any service entertaining\r\ngreater doubt of success, at the same time with more determination\r\nto encounter difficulties.... The Dutch expedition was walking on\r\nvelvet compared to this.”[105] On February 22, he put to sea, and\r\nafter a stormy passage of eight days reached Aboukir Bay--a wide\r\nindentation on the western coast of the delta of the Nile, where\r\nin August, 1798, Nelson had destroyed the fleet which had convoyed\r\nNapoleon’s army to Egypt. Though for several days the waves were too\r\nhigh to admit of disembarkation, small ships were able to reconnoitre\r\nthe coast closely, and their reports determined Abercromby to land\r\non a narrow promontory which, running north-east from Alexandria for\r\neight or nine miles, separates the waters of the Mediterranean from\r\nthose of Lake Aboukir, or Lake Madie as it is sometimes called.[106]\r\n\r\nSir Ralph’s effective strength consisted of about 16,000 men,[107]\r\nincluding the live hundred cavalry for whom horses had been obtained,\r\nand the gunners with sixteen field-pieces. The infantry were formed\r\ninto six brigades and a reserve; the latter, a unit double the\r\nstrength of any of the other brigades, was commanded by Major-General\r\n(afterwards Sir John) Moore. The XVIIIth doubtless wished to serve\r\nunder the orders of Moore, whose worth they had learned at Calvi,\r\nbut, with the 8th, 13th, and 90th regiments, found themselves under\r\nMajor-General Cradock, whose brigade (the second) was composed of\r\nbattalions of very unequal strength; the 90th had 850 officers and\r\nmen; the 13th were weaker by a hundred; the 8th had 538 of all\r\nranks, while the roll of the XVIIIth only bore 523 names.[108] Not\r\nall the men in Abercromby’s little army were British born. About\r\n2700 were foreigners: Stuart’s Minorca regiment was a collection of\r\nne’er-do-weels from every country in Europe; De Roll’s was composed\r\nof Swiss; Dillon’s of French Royalists; Hompesch’s dragoons were\r\nGermans, while the Corsican Rangers probably contained some of the\r\nmen first raised and disciplined by Montresor of the XVIIIth. To meet\r\nthis expedition Menou, the French Commander-in-Chief, had under his\r\norders about 21,500 combatants; his cavalry was superb; he possessed\r\nsixty-six field-guns; many of his infantry were veterans whom\r\nNapoleon had led from victory to victory in the plains of Lombardy.\r\nEleven thousand troops were concentrated at Cairo, 6000 were allotted\r\nto the defence of Alexandria and of the coast from that city to\r\nRosetta; 1800 held the country round Damietta; 1000 were absorbed\r\nby the garrisons of Suez, Balbeis, and Salalieh; the remainder were\r\nstationed in Upper Egypt. The news of Abercromby’s appearance off the\r\nDelta reached Cairo about the same time as a report that a Turkish\r\nforce was advancing slowly through Syria upon Egypt. Menou, puzzled\r\nby the situation, frittered away his strength by sending detachments\r\nto unimportant points; he did not at once reinforce Alexandria, and\r\nthus when Abercromby disembarked he was met by only two thousand men\r\nwith fifteen pieces of field artillery.\r\n\r\nUntil March 7, no landing was possible, but then the weather\r\nmoderated, and at 2 A.M. on the 8th, a rocket from the Admiral’s\r\nship gave the signal to put into execution the scheme which had been\r\nrepeatedly explained to the officers of both services. The boats\r\nwere to form up in three lines at a place of assembly, marked by\r\nthree small craft anchored out of gun-shot from the shore. The first\r\nline consisted of large flat-bottom row-boats, each containing fifty\r\nsoldiers, and of launches carrying field-guns ready for instant use:\r\nthese boats and launches were to be fifty feet apart, and to keep\r\n“interval” and “dressing” accurately. In second line were ships’\r\nboats, to help the first line in case of need. Behind them followed\r\nthe third line--cutters towing launches, full of men of the same\r\nregiment as that directly in front of them. These supporting troops\r\nwere to land in the fifty-feet interval between the boats of the\r\nfirst line. The Reserve, the brigade of Guards, and part of the first\r\nbrigade were the units named in orders to lead the way, and by 3.30\r\nA.M. they were in the boats; but owing to the extreme shallowness\r\nof the water many of the transports were anchored so far from the\r\nshore that it was not until 9 o’clock that the last of the troops\r\nhad reached the rendezvous. Then on the signal of the naval captain\r\nin charge the sailors gave way, and in silence, only broken by the\r\nregular dip of hundreds of oars into the water, rowed steadily\r\ntowards the yellow sandhills where the soldiers were to land. Until\r\nthe first line was well within their range, the French gave no sign\r\nof life; then they poured a perfect hurricane of round-shot, grape,\r\nand musketry upon the leading boats, several of which were sunk. As\r\nsoon as the first shot came whistling round their ears, the sailors\r\nrowed harder than ever; the soldiers, packed like herrings in a tub,\r\ncould do nothing but cheer until the bluejackets ran into shallow\r\nwater, when their turn came; springing overboard, they waded to the\r\nshore and fought hand to hand with the French, who lunged fiercely\r\nat them with their bayonets as they struggled up the slippery beach.\r\nAfter a short but sharp engagement the French fell back, but not\r\nuntil they had inflicted upon us a loss heavy in comparison to\r\nthe number of men actually engaged. Among the sailors there were\r\nninety-seven casualties; of the soldiers a hundred and two were\r\nkilled, five hundred and fifteen wounded, and thirty-five missing,\r\nor a total in the two services of seven hundred and forty-nine.\r\nThe Royal Irish and the remainder of the second brigade had been\r\ntransferred to small Greek ships of light draft, which moved close\r\ninshore to support the advance-guard, but before Cradock could land\r\nhis troops, the French were in retreat, and thus on this memorable\r\nday the XVIIIth did not come into action.[109]\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of this thoughtfully planned, carefully\r\nrehearsed, and brilliantly executed stroke, the remainder of the\r\ntroops disembarked without difficulty, and began to move towards\r\nAlexandria. Their progress, however, was very slow, for Abercromby\r\nwas crippled by want of land transport, and until, by a second\r\nvictory, he could win the Egyptians to his side and obtain from\r\nthem camels and oxen, he was forced to rely for his supplies on the\r\nservice of small craft by which the Navy landed food and stores on\r\nthe shores of Lake Aboukir, where his left flank rested. The army\r\nhalted on the 12th in front of a line of sandhills strongly held\r\nby the enemy, against whose possible night attack were taken the\r\nprecautions thus described in Moore’s diary: “The 90th and 92nd were\r\nput under my command. I divided these two regiments each into three\r\nbodies, separated at such distances as to cover the front of the\r\narmy, and I ordered each body to throw forward one-third of their\r\nnumbers, with the officers belonging to it, as sentries in front.\r\nThis formed a strong chain, which was relieved every hour by one\r\nof the thirds in reserve. The enemy was so close to us that it was\r\nevident that neither army could move without bringing on an action.”\r\nFrom this position Abercromby determined to drive the French by a\r\nfrontal attack combined with a turning movement on their right; and\r\nearly on the 13th he moved from his bivouac in three huge columns,\r\nwith the 90th regiment covering the front as advance-guard. The\r\nundulations of the ground hid the centre column from the French\r\nGeneral, who, thinking that our right and left columns were too far\r\napart to be able to support each other, determined to crush them\r\nin detail, and covering his advance by a vigorous and well-aimed\r\nartillery fire descended into the plain. Cradock’s brigade deployed\r\ninto line “with great quickness and precision,” and pressed on to\r\nmeet the foe, whose cavalry, after a fruitless attack upon the\r\nadvance-guard, charged the main body with great determination, but\r\nwere so hotly received with well-aimed musketry that they were\r\ndriven back in confusion. Of the part played by the XVIIIth in this\r\nepisode the regimental record of service contains a spirited, though\r\nsomewhat breathless description.\r\n\r\n  “A strong body of cavalry having meanwhile charged the two\r\n  regiments supporting the left of the front line, but being\r\n  repulsed, rode in towards the 2nd brigade under cover of some\r\n  sand hills; and observing an interval between our regiment and\r\n  that on its left, immediately advanced to charge through it,\r\n  in which they must have succeeded had they not been checked\r\n  by a prompt and well-directed fire from our Light company,\r\n  for, unfortunately, the left battalion of the brigade having\r\n  mistaken them, from their green uniforms for Hompesch’s Hussars\r\n  (attached to our army) not only suffered them to ride quietly\r\n  along their front, but kept calling out to us not to fire upon\r\n  them; this error having, however, been fortunately discovered\r\n  when the cavalry were within a hundred paces of us, and in the\r\n  act of wheeling up to charge, the regiment halted, and opening a\r\n  steady and rapid platoon fire immediately after that of the Light\r\n  company, brought down a great number of men and horses, threw\r\n  them into complete disorder and compelled them to a precipitate\r\n  retreat, though many of them had even arrived within a few paces\r\n  of the interval on our left. Had not the Royal Irish so timely\r\n  opened its fire, the brigade must have been broken through, and\r\n  the enemy penetrated to the second line, which in firing on them\r\n  must at the same time have fired upon us. This cavalry, by a\r\n  strange coincidence, happened to be the 18th regiment of heavy\r\n  dragoons, and afterwards (when a troop of this corps was taken in\r\n  the desert) they said, pointing to us, ‘had it not been for that\r\n  regiment it was all over with your expedition.’”\r\n\r\nThe action raged along nearly the whole line till the French,\r\nstaggered by the warmth of their reception and overborne by superior\r\nnumbers, gave way, and retired to the works of Nicopolis, where a\r\nseries of redoubts stretching across the peninsula barred the way\r\nto Alexandria. The enemy covered his retreat with sharpshooters,\r\nsupported by artillery so mobile and so well-handled that the British\r\nwere filled with admiration, contrasting its quick movements to those\r\nof our field-guns which, from want of horses, had to be dragged\r\nlaboriously by hand. Abercromby hoped to carry the lines of Nicopolis\r\nwith a rush, and followed the French across the plain between their\r\nfirst and second positions until he had to halt to make dispositions\r\nfor the assault. For several hours the troops remained stationary\r\nunder a murderous fire from the enemy’s batteries, waiting to be\r\nlet loose upon the French; but when a careful reconnaissance had\r\nconvinced Abercromby that the second position was too strong to be\r\ncarried until its defenders had been shaken by a heavy bombardment,\r\nhe reluctantly ordered his little army to retire, and in perfect\r\norder it marched back to the ground from which the enemy had been\r\ndriven in the morning, and settled down into bivouac. The General\r\nwas not unmindful of the good work done by Cradock’s command; in\r\na general order thanking the troops for “their soldier-like and\r\nintrepid conduct, he felt it incumbent on him particularly to express\r\nhis most perfect satisfaction with the steady and gallant conduct\r\nof Major-General Cradock’s brigade;” and in his despatch to the\r\nSecretary of State for War, when describing the events of the early\r\npart of the battle, he stated: “Major-General Cradock immediately\r\nformed his brigade to meet the attack made by the enemy; and the\r\ntroops[110] changed their position with a quickness and precision\r\nwhich did them the greatest honour. The remainder of the army\r\nfollowed so good an example, and immediately were in a situation not\r\nonly to face but to repel the enemy.”\r\n\r\nThis action cost the lives of six officers and a hundred and fifty\r\nof the other ranks; sixty-seven officers and a thousand and two\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men were wounded; the sailors and\r\nmarines together lost eighty-four of all ranks; thus the casualties\r\nin both services amounted to thirteen hundred and nine killed and\r\nwounded. Though the regiments under Cradock’s command suffered more\r\nthan those in the other brigades, losing upwards of five hundred\r\nofficers and men, the XVIIIth escaped comparatively lightly. Captain\r\nGeorge Jones was killed, and three officers, whose names are not\r\nmentioned in the despatch, were wounded; among the other ranks a\r\nsergeant and forty-five rank and file were wounded.[111] The French\r\ndid not lose as heavily as we did--not more than five hundred of\r\ntheir troops were put out of action; but they left in our hands four\r\nguns and a large quantity of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe position that Abercromby now held was about a mile and a half\r\nlong, stretching from the Mediterranean on the right to Lake\r\nAboukir on the left. In front of the right and centre rose a chain\r\nof sandhills; on the left the ground was level. While the heavy\r\nartillery and ordnance stores were being slowly moved over the nine\r\nmiles of sandy track between Aboukir Bay and the bivouac, the General\r\nentrenched himself, posting Cradock’s brigade on the extreme left of\r\nthe front line. On the 19th the big guns began to arrive, accompanied\r\nby a recently landed detachment of Turks, of such doubtful military\r\nvalue that they were ordered to halt three miles in rear of the\r\nBritish troops. Next day a friendly Arab chief sent word that\r\nAlexandria had been largely reinforced, thus confirming the reports\r\nfrom the men on outpost who, through the mists of early morning, had\r\nseen long strings of camels moving towards the town. The Arab added\r\nthat the French proposed to attack us at dawn on the 21st. Though not\r\nfully convinced of the truth of this intelligence, Abercromby pressed\r\non his field-works and ordered his troops to stand to arms before\r\ndawn--a wise precaution, for the Arab’s information proved correct.\r\nMenou had accompanied the reinforcements, and after providing an\r\nadequate garrison for Alexandria, could dispose of 10,000 men with\r\nwhom he proposed to surprise the English before daybreak. A feint was\r\nto be made against our left, our centre was to be vigorously engaged,\r\nwhile the full force of the attack was to fall upon the right. As\r\nsoon as it was crumpled up a general movement along the line was\r\nto drive us into the waters of the lake, where we should have to\r\nsurrender or to drown.\r\n\r\nWhile it was still black night on the 21st, the French began the\r\naction by demonstrating against our left, and though the false attack\r\nwas not pressed home, it was successful in so far that troops,\r\nurgently required on other parts of the field, were diverted to the\r\nhelp of Cradock’s brigade. In the centre the enemy made no headway\r\nagainst the steady volleys of the regiments facing him; the danger\r\nwas in his onslaught on our right, where for a long time there raged\r\na series of fierce and confused fights. The piquets were driven in,\r\nand the supports surprised by columns suddenly looming out of the\r\nmurky darkness; reinforcements on either side hurried up, guided by\r\nthe flash of the muskets and the shouts of the combatants--prisoners\r\nand Colours were taken and recaptured, posts lost and regained. At\r\none moment the French slipped unperceived between two corps, which in\r\nthe very nick of time discovered and routed them with the bayonet: a\r\nlittle later a regiment, while hotly engaged in front, was surrounded\r\nby a body of the enemy whose presence was revealed by the sound of\r\na French word of command. The rear rank turned about, and fighting\r\nback to back, drove off their foes. Episodes such as these marked\r\nthe progress of the action until the morning light showed Menou that\r\nall his efforts had been unavailing, and that the British line,\r\nshattered but unconquered, still held its ground. Mad with rage at\r\nhis want of success the French General, against the advice of his\r\nsubordinates, hurled his cavalry, 1200 strong, into the fray. They\r\ncrashed through a regiment whose formation they broke, though not\r\nits spirit, and swept like a torrent over the battlefield until they\r\nreached the camp, where the horses stumbled over the tent-ropes and\r\nfell into the burrows, scratched in the sand as sleeping places\r\nby a corps whose tents had not arrived. The confusion thus caused\r\nwas increased by the cross-fire of the infantry who had been left\r\nin charge of the baggage, and the French cavalry wheeled about and\r\nretired at full speed, leaving the ground behind them covered with\r\ntheir dead. After several more desperate efforts, in which assailants\r\nand assailed displayed equal courage, Menou realised that he was\r\ndefeated, and fell back slowly and in good order. His solid columns\r\noffered a splendid target to our artillerymen; but the guns were\r\nsilent, to the intense surprise of the French who expected to be\r\npursued by a hail of projectiles, and to the mortification of the\r\nBritish infantry, who looked to the gunners to avenge their losses.\r\nBut the gunners could not fire; they were as short of ammunition as\r\nthe foot soldiers themselves, many of whom had been forced to rely\r\nexclusively on their bayonets in the later phases of the battle.\r\nIt was not that ammunition was lacking in the camp, but owing to a\r\nstaff blunder there was no means of getting it up to the fighting\r\nline. Had our gunners been able to do their duty the French loss\r\nwould have been enormous, but they escaped with 2000 casualties.[112]\r\nOn our side the gallant Abercromby was mortally wounded; and of the\r\n11,500 men engaged, 10 officers and 233 other ranks were killed; 60\r\nofficers and 1133 other ranks wounded; 3 officers and 29 men missing.\r\nThe Royal Irish, who were on the left flank of Cradock’s brigade,\r\nand therefore far away from the scene of the serious fighting, were\r\nalmost untouched, only two private soldiers being wounded.\r\n\r\nSome days were spent in the work of reorganisation. Stores and\r\nammunition had to be brought up from Aboukir, and arrangements\r\nmade with the natives for the hire of transport of various kinds.\r\nBefore the army was ready to move Sir Ralph Abercromby died, deeply\r\nregretted by all who had been privileged to serve under him. He was\r\nsucceeded by a future Colonel of the XVIIIth, Major-General the Hon.\r\nJohn Hely-Hutchinson,[113] who decided to leave Major-General Coote\r\nto invest Alexandria with 6000 men, while he himself led the main\r\ncolumn to Cairo. As a first step he sent a mixed force of British and\r\nTurks across the desert to seize Rosetta, a town important from its\r\nposition at the mouth of the western branch of the Nile, and a few\r\ndays later reinforced it with the XVIIIth and the 90th regiments.\r\nRosetta was occupied without trouble; our gunboats entered the\r\nNile; a large amount of river craft was collected, and on May 4,\r\n9500 British and Turkish troops began to move upon Cairo.[114] The\r\nmarch proved a very trying one, for the heat was great, the climate\r\nexhausting, and as there were no roads and practically no land\r\ntransport, the army had to depend for its supplies on the flotilla of\r\nboats which accompanied its progress towards the capital of Egypt.\r\nSending a strong detachment to the right bank of the river to connect\r\nhim with the Turkish contingent from Syria, Hely-Hutchinson worked\r\nup the left bank with the main body, gradually capturing or driving\r\naway the garrisons of the fortified posts along the Nile. In these\r\nsmall affairs the Royal Irish had no opportunity of distinguishing\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAfter joining forces with the Turks, the General pushed on towards\r\nCairo, and halting on the 16th of June within a few miles of the\r\ncity, found the French much more disposed to treat for surrender than\r\nto fight. The perimeter of the crumbling fortifications was far too\r\nlarge to be adequately defended by the 9000 effective men to whom the\r\ngarrison was reduced; outside the walls was encamped an Anglo-Turkish\r\narmy of 30,000 men, and Baird’s contingent from India and the Cape\r\nmight any day bring an important accession to its strength; the civil\r\npopulation was disaffected; the _morale_ of the soldiers was shaken\r\nby the events of the campaign; all ranks were anxious to return to\r\nFrance, and it was well known that the English were prepared to\r\ngive them very favourable terms. In such circumstances negotiations\r\nproved swift and easy, and on June 27 a convention was signed, by\r\nwhich Hely-Hutchinson undertook to escort the French garrison with\r\nits baggage, field-guns and ammunition to Rosetta, and there embark\r\nit for the French ports on the Mediterranean. The march from Cairo\r\nto the sea, organised and commanded by Moore, was a very delicate\r\noperation, brilliantly carried out. It began on July 15: the Turks\r\nled the column; then, after a long interval, followed the French\r\ninfantry and guns, their cavalry abreast of them, but on the left\r\nflank, farthest from the river; some distance behind came the British\r\ncolumn, with a detachment of dragoons and Turkish cavalry bringing up\r\nthe rear. Three hundred river craft, filled with sick and baggage,\r\nslowly dropped down the Nile under the escort of our gunboats,\r\nand kept up constant communication between the French and English\r\ncolumns. The embarkation was completed on the 7th of August, when\r\n13,672 soldiers and 82 civilians sailed for France, in transports\r\nconvoyed by British men-of-war. Everything passed off smoothly,\r\nbut of all the British officers at Rosetta none can have been more\r\nheartily thankful when the last of our enemies was safely on board\r\nship than Colonel Montresor, who, as governor, was responsible for\r\nthe safety of the persons and the property of the inhabitants while\r\nthe French troops were marching through the town.\r\n\r\nHely-Hutchinson now turned his attention to Alexandria, which he\r\nhad left invested by General Coote when the main body advanced upon\r\nCairo. Thanks to the arrival of large reinforcements from England,\r\nhe was now able to besiege it in due form, and pushed on his works\r\nso fast that on the 31st of August the garrison, 10,528 strong,\r\nsurrendered on terms identical with those granted at Cairo. The Royal\r\nIrish were present at the operations, and with other picked troops\r\ntheir grenadier company, with drums beating and Colours flying,\r\nmarched into Alexandria to take formal possession of the town.\r\nTheir triumphal entry marked the end of the Egyptian campaign, in\r\nwhich 500 officers and men were killed and 3058 were wounded: how\r\nmany died from sickness is not known, but the mortality must have\r\nbeen considerable. In the regiment Captain-Lieutenant G. Jones was\r\nkilled, and Captain W. Morgue, Ensign H. Bruley, Ensign W. Brand,\r\nQuartermaster M. M‘Dermott, and fifty-six of the other ranks died\r\nfrom wounds, accident, or disease.[115] During the summer the Royal\r\nIrish suffered much from sickness, and in the month of July more than\r\ntwo hundred men were in hospital, chiefly from ophthalmia, which was\r\nthen raging among the troops.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of Parliament were voted to both services; the XVIIIth\r\nRoyal Irish were authorised to carry on the Colours the emblem of a\r\nSphinx and the word “Egypt,” and gold medals were presented by the\r\nSultan to all the officers of the regiment. It was not until the year\r\n1847 that a British medal was issued for this campaign, when only\r\nthree officers--Hill, Beavan, and Deane--were still alive to claim\r\nthe decoration.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last of the French were shipped off to France,\r\nHely-Hutchinson’s army was broken up. Some of the troops remained to\r\nshare with Baird’s contingent the duty of holding Egypt for a few\r\nmonths; the remainder returned to various parts of the Mediterranean\r\nto await the results of the negotiations for peace then going on\r\nbetween the Governments of England and France. The Royal Irish\r\nwere sent first to Malta, and then on to Elba, where Montresor was\r\nappointed military governor of Porto Ferraio for the second time: and\r\nwhen peace was declared the regiment was ordered home, and landed at\r\nCork at the end of August, 1802.\r\n\r\nThough there were many signs that France looked upon the Peace of\r\nAmiens more as a truce than as the end of her struggle with Britain,\r\nour Government soon began to cut down all military expenditure with\r\nunreasoning haste. Wholesale discharges from the army left only\r\n40,000 regular troops in the United Kingdom; the militia, after an\r\nembodiment of nine years, were sent to their homes; the “fencible”\r\nregiments of horse and foot, raised for purposes of local defence,\r\nwere disbanded. Thus the renewal of the war in 1803 found us almost\r\ndisarmed; and when Napoleon collected an army for the invasion\r\nof England the Government was hard pressed to raise a garrison\r\nsufficient for the needs of the United Kingdom. By paying huge\r\nbounties to recruits the numbers of the regular army were increased\r\nto 12,000 cavalry and 75,000 infantry; bounties nearly as large\r\nattracted 80,000 men to the militia; while to escape a mitigated\r\nform of compulsory service, introduced to catch those who would not\r\nserve of their own free will, 343,000 men joined corps of Yeomanry\r\nor regiments of Volunteers. How far this mass of armed men would\r\nhave been able to face veterans who had won innumerable victories in\r\nwestern and central Europe is a matter of speculation. Happily for\r\nEngland at the beginning of the nineteenth century, though perhaps\r\nunhappily for the British Empire of the present day, the threatened\r\ninvasion did not take place, and our race had no opportunity to\r\nascertain by practical experience whether Britons, very imperfectly\r\ntrained to war, are as good fighting men as foreigners who have\r\nthoroughly mastered the soldier’s trade before they meet their enemy\r\non the battlefield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 3.\r\n\r\n  THE BASIN\r\n  of\r\n  THE MEDITERRANEAN\r\n  1727. 1793-1801\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nAmong the steps taken to increase the regular army was the formation\r\nof additional battalions of infantry, one or two of which were\r\nallotted to existing regiments. The second battalion of the XVIIIth\r\nwas raised in Ireland in 1803, and, like the first, served in\r\nScotland until the summer of 1804, when both were sent to Barham\r\nDowns, one of the many camps in the south of England where large\r\nnumbers of troops stood ready to march towards the coast. After\r\na few months the first battalion was ordered to the West Indies,\r\nand sailing in January, 1805, with other corps, reached Jamaica at\r\nthe end of April, 935 strong.[116] The second battalion remained at\r\nBarham Downs until the destruction of the Franco-Spanish fleet at\r\nTrafalgar put an end to Napoleon’s hope of obtaining the temporary\r\ncommand of the Channel necessary to pass his troops across the\r\nStraits of Dover. As soon as all danger of invasion was over the\r\nencampment was broken up, and the second battalion was sent to\r\ngarrison Jersey.\r\n\r\nWhen the first battalion of the Royal Irish landed at Kingston,\r\nthe island was in a fever of anxiety, for the attitude of the\r\nblack population, who had been thoroughly unsettled by the French\r\nRevolution, was disquieting not only in Jamaica but throughout\r\nthe British West Indies; the coasts were infested by privateers\r\nwho captured many trading ships; and a great fleet of the enemy’s\r\nmen-of-war was reported to be cruising among the neighbouring\r\nislands. These French ships, however, were part of the squadrons\r\nsent by Napoleon to decoy Nelson and his brother admirals from their\r\nblockade of the seaports on the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay:\r\ntheir business was to evade the British fleet, to return to Europe,\r\nand joining forces with the remainder of the Franco-Spanish fleet,\r\nto sweep all British men-of-war from the Channel before our admirals\r\nhad discovered that they had quitted the West Indies. Thus Jamaica\r\nwas not attacked; in a few months the excitement died down, and the\r\nRoyal Irish fell into the routine of the station where they were\r\ndestined to spend twelve long and dreary years. Once there seemed a\r\nprospect of active service: in 1809 they were ordered to form part of\r\nan expedition to the island of San Domingo,[117] where the Spaniards,\r\nwho had again become our allies, were waging war against the French\r\ngarrison. Major-General Sir Hugh Carmichael sailed from Jamaica on\r\nthe 7th of June, and landed three weeks later at Polingue, a port\r\nthirty miles from the city of San Domingo, where the Spaniards were\r\nbesieging the common enemy. As soon as his troops were safe on shore\r\nthe General hurried up to the front, and after a reconnaissance\r\ndecided that, as the French had already held out for eight months,\r\nthe best way to deal with them would be by a sudden and vigorous\r\nattack. At nightfall on the 1st of July his men struggled up from the\r\ncoast, tired out by heavy marches in pouring rain, over bad roads,\r\nthrough unbridged rivers, and without horses for the guns, which\r\nhad to be dragged by hand. Next day the French opened negotiations\r\nfor surrender, but asked for such impossible terms that Carmichael\r\nmade his plans to storm the works, and allotted to the Royal Irish\r\nan important part in the operations; but before the assault could be\r\ndelivered the garrison of the town capitulated. As the tricolor still\r\nflew over an outlying fort, Major E. Walker, XVIIIth regiment, was\r\nsent to reduce it with the Light companies of his own and two other\r\nbattalions: but on the approach of the little column, the officer in\r\ncommand laid down his arms, and with the lowering of his flag passed\r\naway the last chance of the Royal Irish of distinguishing themselves\r\nin the second phase of the great war with France. The terms of the\r\ncapitulation were much the same as those granted in Corsica and\r\nEgypt: the French were to be sent back to their own country, and\r\nafter the Royal Irish had seen their enemies safely embarked for\r\nFrance, they returned to Jamaica. At the taking of San Domingo none\r\nof the British were injured, while few if any died of sickness in the\r\nisland. In this respect they were infinitely more fortunate than the\r\ntroops who served in the campaign in San Domingo between 1793 and\r\n1795, when in a few weeks whole regiments were virtually annihilated\r\nby yellow fever, which in those three years claimed 40,000 victims\r\nfrom the army and the fleet in West Indian waters.\r\n\r\nAs the news of Wellington’s successive victories in the Peninsula\r\nslowly made its way to Jamaica the hearts of the Royal Irish must\r\nhave sunk very low, when they realised that they were stationed in\r\na part of the world where there was no prospect of adding to the\r\nlaurels of the regiment. Yet their lot was common to the greater part\r\nof the British army, scattered over the whole face of the globe, in\r\nplaces where the prospect of active service seemed most improbable.\r\nIn 1809, England had about 218,000 regular soldiers, of whom only\r\n22,000 were fighting in the Peninsula. A hundred and eight thousand\r\nwere locked up in the United Kingdom, to give solidity to the 450,000\r\nMilitia and Volunteers then under arms; the Mediterranean fortresses\r\nand Sicily absorbed 22,000; the West Indies nearly as many; 8000\r\nguarded the Canadian frontier; the communication with the East was\r\nkept open by 900 at Madeira, and nearly 6000 at the Cape; 4000 held\r\nthe Island of Ceylon; in India were 24,000 white troops, of whom\r\nonly 4000 were in the pay of the East India Company, while 1300 were\r\nemployed in keeping order in the penal settlement of New South Wales.\r\nThe corps of artillery and engineers and troops at sea accounted for\r\nthe remainder of the army.\r\n\r\nThe second battalion was no more fortunate than the first, for in\r\n1807 it was ordered to a recently acquired British possession in the\r\nWest Indies, the island of Curaçoa. In December, 1806, a gallant\r\nsailor, Captain Sir Charles Brisbane, was ordered to reconnoitre the\r\nisland, then belonging to Holland; converting his reconnaissance\r\ninto an attack, he led his four frigates into the harbour, and\r\nboarded two Dutch men-of-war lying at anchor; then sending landing\r\nparties on shore he captured the forts, and made himself master\r\nof Curaçoa. The battalion arrived in June, 726 strong,[118] and\r\nremained stationary until 1810, when, worn down to a mere skeleton\r\nby sickness, and by large drafts to the sister battalion in Jamaica,\r\nit was ordered home to recruit. Beyond the fact that in 1808 the\r\nofficers presented a handsome sword of honour to Brisbane, whom they\r\nfound installed at Curaçoa as Governor, nothing is known of the\r\ndoings of the second battalion during its short existence, which\r\nended in 1814, when, like nearly all the other second battalions of\r\nthe army, it was disbanded. The story of its resuscitation will be\r\nfound in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nThough neither battalion was on active service in the West Indies,\r\nfor the expedition to San Domingo cannot be counted as a campaign,\r\nthe regiment was exposed during this tour of duty in the colonies to\r\ndangers greater and far more trying than those of pitched battles.\r\nTropical diseases played havoc among the Royal Irish: between the\r\narrival of the first battalion in the middle of 1805, and its return\r\nto England in the spring of 1817, the loss of both battalions\r\nfrom sickness was fifty-two officers and seventeen hundred and\r\nseventy-seven non-commissioned officers and men.[119] The heaviest\r\nmortality appears to have occurred during the two months ending\r\nJanuary 25, 1806, when a hundred and forty names were added to the\r\nlist of dead. Nor was disease the only peril to which the Royal Irish\r\nwere exposed. While they were stationed in Jamaica the island was\r\nscourged by earthquakes and tidal waves, by fires that destroyed\r\nflourishing towns, by floods that laid waste great tracts of\r\ncultivated land. There were mutinies among the regiments raised from\r\nthe slaves; conspiracies among the negroes to murder the white men,\r\nand widespread disaffection and unrest throughout all the coloured\r\npopulation. After such grim experiences of West Indian life it was\r\nwith feelings of great joy that in January, 1817, the regiment bade\r\nfarewell to the land where so many hundreds of their comrades had\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1817-1848.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST WAR WITH CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment landed at Portsmouth in March, 1817.\r\nSince 1783, the Royal Irish had only served three years in the United\r\nKingdom, and they looked forward to a long tour of duty at home, but\r\nthe fates were against them. Almost as soon as Napoleon surrendered\r\nhimself to the captain of the _Bellerophon_ the economists in the\r\nHouse of Commons began to demand retrenchment in the army, and with\r\nsuch success that in 1821 only 101,000 men, exclusive of the troops\r\nin the East India Company’s service, were left to protect the whole\r\nof the British possessions throughout the world. The garrison of the\r\nUnited Kingdom absorbed about half the army, the remainder being\r\nstationed in India and the colonies, where, it is said, Wellington\r\nhid them to be out of sight of the anti-military politicians. Among\r\nthe regiments ordered abroad was the XVIIIth, which in February,\r\n1821, left Cork for the Mediterranean; it spent three years at Malta\r\nand eight in the Ionian Isles,[120] and in March, 1832, returned to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1832, the Royal Irish were quartered in detachments\r\nin various towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire; during the general\r\nelection at the end of the year several companies were called upon\r\nto help the civil power in quelling serious riots at Sheffield,\r\nBolton, and Preston, where officers and men won high praise for the\r\ncombination of forbearance and determination which they showed in\r\ndealing with excited mobs. Towards the end of 1833 the regiment was\r\nconcentrated at Manchester, whence on May 8, 1834, to quote the words\r\nin which the Digest of Service records the first train journey of\r\nthe XVIIIth, it “proceeded by railway conveyance” to Liverpool to\r\nembark for Dublin. In September the regiment moved to Cork; a few\r\nmonths later it was at Birr, and early in 1836, while at Athlone,\r\nit was warned for foreign service in Ceylon. Throughout their\r\ntour of duty in the United Kingdom the Royal Irish received warm\r\ncommendation from all the generals under whom they had served, and\r\nthese favourable opinions were fully endorsed in a letter from the\r\nAdjutant-General, who on December 20, 1834, wrote that “the report\r\nof the XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment is considered most satisfactory.\r\nThe excellent state of its discipline is highly creditable to Colonel\r\nBurrell, and Lord Hill cannot be but more disposed to attachment\r\n(_sic_) to that officer’s exertions when he finds that discipline\r\nhas been so effectually maintained without having had recourse to\r\ncorporal punishment for a period exceeding two years.”\r\n\r\nTwo companies under Major Pratt sailed from Cork in the transport\r\n_Numa_ on November 15, 1836, and arrived at Colombo towards the end\r\nof April, 1837. The remainder of the corps, under Colonel Burrell,\r\nembarked in the transport _Barossa_, touched at Teneriffe and Rio\r\nde Janeiro, and reached its destination at the end of May. After\r\nserving for some time at Colombo, where new colours were presented\r\nby Lieutenant-General Sir John Wilson, K.C.B., the headquarters and\r\na wing of the regiment were stationed at Trincomalee, where in 1840\r\nwelcome news reached them. Trouble had arisen with China, and the\r\nregiment was to form part of an expedition against the Celestial\r\nEmpire. The causes of our quarrel with the Emperor of China, very\r\nshortly stated, were that the Chinese had not kept to the treaties\r\nof commerce which they had entered into with England; they had\r\nattacked and robbed British merchants, fired upon English ships, and\r\ngrossly insulted the representative of the Queen. The Mandarins, or\r\nhigh officials of Canton, were the chief offenders; to punish them\r\na naval blockade of that port was established; ships of war were\r\nordered up from the Indian station, and a small body of troops was\r\ncollected to co-operate with the Navy in bringing the Chinese to\r\ntheir senses. The six companies of the Royal Irish in Ceylon sailed\r\neastwards in May and June, 1840, and the three depôt companies,\r\nrecently landed at Bombay from England, joined headquarters soon\r\nafter the regiment arrived in China, raising it to a total strength\r\nof 667 of all ranks.[121] The other British regiments were the 26th\r\nand the 49th; the Native army of India contributed detachments of\r\nMadras Artillery and Sappers and Miners, a corps known as the Bengal\r\nVolunteers, and the 37th regiment of Madras Native Infantry, while\r\nthe Navy was represented by three line-of-battle ships, two frigates,\r\nfourteen smaller men-of-war, four armed steamers, and twenty-seven\r\ntransports. With this small force England was about to go to war\r\nwith a country of three hundred and sixty millions of inhabitants,\r\nwhose seaport towns were defended by forts bristling with ordnance\r\nvarying in calibre from 68-pr. to 18-pr. guns, and whose army\r\nimmeasurably exceeded in number the British fighting men. Fortunately\r\nfor us the Chinese artillerymen, though not wanting in courage, were\r\nill-trained; their forts, though massive, were badly planned; and the\r\ninfantry, though they often fought well and showed much courage as\r\nindividuals, were poorly disciplined, badly armed, and as a rule very\r\nbadly commanded. Though the government of Pekin had spent much money\r\nin making cannon on European models, they had neglected to reproduce\r\nthe muskets with which the troops of the white races were equipped.\r\nThus the Chinese foot soldiers did not possess the equivalent of our\r\nflint-lock smooth-bore muskets; their firearms were matchlocks and\r\ngingals or portable wall pieces, worked on tripods by a crew of three\r\nmen, and throwing two-ounce balls. Their other weapons varied; the\r\nTartars, the picked troops of the Empire, used the bow; other corps\r\nhad spears and swords, while others again carried battle-axes and\r\nvery unpleasant cutting instruments like bill-hooks, fastened to the\r\nend of long poles.\r\n\r\nThe policy and general conduct of our expedition was entrusted to\r\ntwo Plenipotentiaries. One of these officials soon broke down in\r\nhealth and disappeared from the scene; the other, who was credited\r\nwith some knowledge of the Chinese character, proved to be amiable\r\nand well-intentioned, but vacillating, credulous, and incompetent\r\nto meet the wiles of Eastern diplomacy. His gullibility and want of\r\nbackbone cruelly hampered the movements of the sailors and soldiers\r\nuntil, many months after the beginning of the war, he was replaced by\r\nSir Henry Pottinger, an Indian officer of large experience in dealing\r\nwith Oriental races.\r\n\r\nAfter assembling at Singapore, the point fixed for the general\r\nrendezvous, the fleet sailed for China, and, contrary to the\r\nuniversal expectation, did not stop at the mouth of the Canton river,\r\nbut followed the coast upwards to the island of Chusan.[122] From\r\nits position near the mouth of the Yang-Tse-Kiang river this island\r\nwas of great strategic importance, and was required as a base of\r\noperations. Tinghae, its principal town, was weakly held, but when\r\nthe Mandarins were summoned to surrender they replied that, though\r\nthey had no hope of making a successful resistance, they were in\r\nhonour bound to defend their post. After a short bombardment by the\r\nmen-of-war on July 5, 1840, the troops were landed, the XVIIIth\r\nleading the attack, and the place fell into our hands. Our casualties\r\nwere very few; the Chinese, on the contrary, lost very heavily, but\r\nthe climate quickly avenged them. For several months the troops were\r\nkept inactive in Chusan, which proved to be a hot-bed of disease. In\r\nthe hope of conciliating the inhabitants the soldiers at first were\r\nordered to live under canvas, though there were hundreds of houses\r\nin which they could have been quartered. The camping grounds were\r\nselected without reference to the doctors, who protested in vain\r\nwhen they saw the “tents pitched on low paddy-fields, surrounded by\r\nstagnant water, putrid and stinking from quantities of dead animal\r\nand vegetable matter. Under a sun hotter than was ever experienced in\r\nIndia,” wrote a Madras army surgeon, “the men on duty were buckled\r\nup to the throat in their full-dress coatees, and in consequence\r\nof there being so few camp followers, fatigue-parties of Europeans\r\nwere daily detailed to carry provisions and stores from the ships to\r\nthe tents, and to perform all menial employments, which experience\r\nhas long taught us they cannot stand in a tropical climate.”[123]\r\nThe troops were fed on rations not only unsuited to the climate but\r\nof bad quality; much of the biscuit was bad, and the meat salted\r\nin India proved uneatable. Small wonder that in such circumstances\r\nintermittent fever, diarrhœa, and dysentery raged among all ranks;\r\nand though after a time the troops were moved into the houses of the\r\nnatives, disease had taken such hold upon all ranks that in November\r\nthere were not more than five hundred effectives at Chusan. The Royal\r\nIrish fared better than the other regiments, as the ships from which\r\nthey drew most of their supplies were laden with stores prepared\r\nnot in India, but in England; but still they suffered severely--two\r\nofficers, Major R. Hammill and Lieutenant H. F. Vavasour, and about\r\nfifty of the other ranks died between July 5th and the end of the\r\nyear.[124] Yet these losses were insignificant compared to those of\r\nthe 26th, which from nine hundred was reduced to a strength, all\r\ntold, of two hundred and ninety-one.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1841, there were combined naval and military operations\r\nagainst the forts at the mouth of the Canton river, in which the\r\nRoyal Irish took no part as they had been left to garrison Chusan;\r\na few of the regiment, however, were present, probably invalids\r\nserving on board ship for change of air. After several batteries had\r\nbeen dismantled and many heavy guns spiked or otherwise disabled,\r\nthe Mandarins made a treaty with the Plenipotentiary, by which they\r\nagreed to cede to us the island of Hong Kong, to pay a considerable\r\nindemnity, and to allow trade to be reopened at Canton, while on\r\nour side we undertook to restore Chusan to the Chinese. No time was\r\nlost in occupying Hong Kong, of which formal possession was taken\r\non February 26, 1841, two days after the Royal Irish arrived there.\r\nColonel Burrell, XVIIIth, had been the senior military officer\r\nthroughout the occupation of Chusan, and very thankful must he have\r\nbeen when, after seeing the last of the garrison safely on board\r\nship, he turned his back on the island which proved fatal to such\r\nnumbers of his men.[125] Very soon after the expedition had been\r\nconcentrated at Hong Kong it became evident that the treaty was not\r\nworth the paper it was written upon. Far from being anxious for\r\npeace, the Chinese had only sought to gain time to prepare for war.\r\nAn army of labourers was strengthening the defences of Canton; an\r\narmy of soldiers was being collected in the interior of China to man\r\nthem; large rewards were offered for the capture of British ships and\r\nBritish fighting men; for a battleship a hundred thousand dollars\r\nwere promised; the Admiral and the Plenipotentiary were worth fifty\r\nthousand dollars each; the other officers were rated on a descending\r\nscale, while the price of a Madras Sepoy was only fifty dollars. On\r\nthe 24th of February the fleet bombarded the celebrated Bogue forts\r\nin the Canton river; five hundred guns were taken, and everyone\r\nhoped that the ships would now be allowed to push up the river and\r\ncapture Canton, when all movements were temporarily arrested by the\r\nannouncement that the Plenipotentiary had entered into a truce.\r\nAs, however, the Chinese did not fulfil its terms, the men-of-war\r\nengaged, silenced and destroyed such of the batteries as they had\r\nnot yet attacked; made their way up the reaches of the river, and\r\nanchored close to Canton. The city lay almost defenceless under their\r\nguns, when the Plenipotentiary agreed to a suspension of hostilities\r\non condition that the port should be reopened to British trade. This\r\narrangement suited the Chinese admirably: the civil population would\r\nbe enriched by the money paid by the merchants for the tea crop,\r\nthen ready for delivery; while the military Mandarins gained time to\r\ncast new ordnance, to rebuild their ruined forts, and to reinforce\r\nthe garrison before again defying the “Barbarians.”[126] The troops\r\nwere ordered back to the harbour of Hong Kong, where Major-General\r\nSir Hugh Gough, who had recently arrived from Madras to take command\r\nof the land forces, reorganised his little army, and attempted,\r\nthough with small success, to infuse his own spirit of determination\r\ninto the weak-kneed Plenipotentiary, whom Gough in a private letter\r\ndescribed as “whimsical as a shuttle-cock.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the position of affairs at Canton once more\r\nbecame most serious. The gun factories had been working night and\r\nday; the forts had been repaired and re-armed; large numbers of\r\nsoldiers had arrived; and in May the extermination was decreed of the\r\nEuropean merchants, who on the faith of the truce had now returned to\r\ntheir counting-houses. This roused the Plenipotentiary into temporary\r\nactivity; he arranged with Gough and the senior naval officer for\r\na combined assault on Canton, and warned all Europeans to leave\r\nthe place forthwith. By the evening of the 23rd of May the navy,\r\nafter hard work in bombarding the river forts by day and warding\r\noff the approach of fire-rafts by night, had prepared the way for\r\nthe execution of Sir Hugh Gough’s plan for the capture of Canton.\r\nThis city of a million inhabitants was surrounded by walls of great\r\nthickness, and from twenty-five to twenty-eight feet in height; its\r\nramparts, bristling with guns, were manned by forty-five thousand\r\nregular soldiers and an equal number of militia. To the west, south,\r\nand east of the town were large and prosperous suburbs, but on the\r\nnorth this expansion had been checked by a range of heights which,\r\nrunning parallel with the northern wall, completely dominated Canton\r\nand its defences. The Chinese had realised that if these heights\r\npassed into the hands of the British the town would become untenable:\r\nnot only had they defended them with four strong forts, armed with\r\nforty-two heavy guns, but they had formed a large entrenched camp\r\noutside the north-eastern corner of the city, in order further to\r\nsecure the safety of the heights which they rightly anticipated\r\nwould be the point of our attack. Such was the position against\r\nwhich Gough, with less than 2800 soldiers, sailors, and marines,\r\nwas about to try his strength. He divided his little force into two\r\ncolumns of very unequal size.[127] The right, or smaller detachment,\r\nwas to force its way through the western suburb as far as the\r\nEuropean settlement, or, as it was locally termed, “the factories”;\r\noccupy it, and place it in a state of defence. General Gough took\r\npersonal command of the left or larger column, which consisted of\r\nfour so-called brigades, the largest of which had in the ranks less\r\nthan 900 officers and men. When the left column had been transhipped\r\ninto all kinds of craft, from smart men-of-war’s gigs to lumbering\r\nnative tea junks, it was towed in a motley procession of about eighty\r\nboats for five miles up a creek of the river to Tingpoo, a village\r\nabout three miles and a half from the western base of the northern\r\nheights. Here the fourth brigade landed without opposition, just as\r\nthe guns of the fleet were thundering out a royal salute in honour of\r\nthe birthday of Queen Victoria. With the 49th regiment Sir Hugh Gough\r\nmade a rapid reconnaissance inland, and then, leaving outposts behind\r\nhim, returned to superintend the disembarkation of the main body.\r\n\r\nDaylight on the 25th saw the whole column in motion, slowly\r\nthreading its way, often in single file, over the densely cultivated\r\nrice-fields which lay between Tingpoo and their objective. The\r\nXVIIIth was ordered to leave an officer and thirty men at the\r\nlanding-place to keep open the communications and to protect stores;\r\nthe duty fell to Lieutenant W. P. Cockburn, who distinguished himself\r\nby the skill he displayed a few hours later in beating off an attack\r\nby a considerable body of the enemy. Until the infantry were within\r\nrange of the western pair of forts the Chinese remained silent;\r\nthen a heavy fire from their guns forced Gough to halt until his\r\nartillery could be brought into action. By eight A.M. the gunners\r\nhad succeeded in dragging two 5½-in. mortars, two 12-pr. howitzers,\r\ntwo 12-pr. field-pieces, and a rocket battery to within 600 yards\r\nof the two western forts. These they bombarded vigorously, while\r\nthe General reconnoitred and issued his orders for the assault: the\r\nNaval brigade was to storm the western forts, while the 1st and\r\n4th brigades were to drive the Chinese from the hills close to the\r\neastern forts. Under cover of our guns the troops advanced, exposed\r\nto a heavy but fortunately ill-directed fire: with great dash the\r\nsailors wrested the western forts from the enemy, who fought with\r\nstubbornness though without skill; the infantry swept over the\r\nheights with such vigour that the Chinese deserted the eastern forts\r\nbefore the troops had time to close upon them; and the Marines, who\r\nhad been detached from Burrell to cope with a demonstration against\r\nour right flank and rear, disposed of their antagonists with little\r\ntrouble. In the charge of the XVIIIth upon the forts the grenadier\r\ncompany led in extended order, accompanied by the General, who in his\r\ndespatch reported that it had seldom fallen to his lot to “witness\r\na more soldier-like and steady advance, or a more animated attack.\r\nEvery individual steadily and gallantly did his duty. The XVIIIth and\r\n49th were emulous which should first reach the appointed goals; but\r\nunder the impulse of this feeling they did not lose sight of that\r\ndiscipline which could alone ensure success.”\r\n\r\nThough the ridge had been won with such ease, the day’s work was\r\nby no means over. As soon as the Chinese realised that the forts\r\nwere lost, they opened from the city walls so heavy a fire of guns,\r\ngingals, and matchlocks that it became necessary to keep the British\r\ntroops well under cover, and part of the garrison of the entrenched\r\ncamp advanced into a village, threatening our left flank. The 49th\r\ndislodged them, but later in the day there was such animation in\r\nthe camp that Gough ordered Burrell to storm it with the Royal\r\nIrish, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. Adams, and a company of Marines.\r\nBetween the foot of the heights held by the British and the enemy’s\r\nentrenchments stretched a great expanse of rice-fields deep in water;\r\na narrow causeway bridged this inundation, and along it, under a\r\ngalling fire, the XVIIIth advanced at the double, scattered the enemy\r\nin every direction, set fire to the tents, and blew up the magazines.\r\nThis success was not a bloodless one--three officers were wounded,\r\nand there were some casualties in the other ranks. The assault was\r\nled by Captain Grattan, whose “spirited conduct” on this occasion\r\nled Gough to select him to carry despatches to the Governor-General\r\nof India.[128] With the capture of the village the operations ended,\r\nfor though Gough was burning to assault the northern wall of the\r\ntown, his heavy guns were not yet in position, and his infantry, out\r\nof training from their long detention on board ship, were completely\r\nexhausted by the abnormal heat of the day. To this exhaustion the\r\nunsuitable dress of the soldiers doubtless contributed not a little.\r\nNotwithstanding the protests of the doctors the men still wore\r\ntightly buttoned red coatees or shell jackets, stocks, and blue\r\nNankin trousers; and their headgear was a huge shako or a small\r\nforage cap, both useless in an almost tropical climate.\r\n\r\nGough’s little force bivouacked on the heights they had won, elated\r\nat their own success and at that of the right column, which had made\r\ngood its position in “the factories.” Early on the 26th, before our\r\nartillery was ready to open fire, the Chinese sent a messenger to\r\nsay that they desired peace; Gough replied that before entering into\r\nany negotiations he must see the Chinese General, and in waiting\r\nfor this elusive personage, who never appeared, several hours were\r\nwasted; then torrents of rain rendered any movements impossible, and\r\nGough had to content himself with completing his preparations for\r\nthe storming of the city wall on the 27th. But in his plans he had\r\nnot reckoned with the Plenipotentiary, who, without consulting the\r\nofficers commanding the naval and military forces, agreed with the\r\nChinese to accept an indemnity of six millions of dollars, to be paid\r\nwithin six days, when the whole expedition was to retire from the\r\nCanton river. Remonstrances were useless, for the Plenipotentiary was\r\nsupreme, and after several anxious days spent in skirmishing with\r\nthe local irregular troops, the soldiers re-embarked and the fleet\r\nonce more returned to Hong Kong, leaving the Chinese more firmly\r\nconvinced than ever that the English were as easy to hoodwink in\r\ndiplomacy as they were difficult to fight in battle. These operations\r\ncost fourteen killed and ninety-one wounded. The casualties in the\r\nRoyal Irish were Captain J. J. Sargent, Lieutenants D. Edwardes and\r\nG. Hilliard wounded, and five men killed or wounded.[129]\r\n\r\nOwing to a combination of adverse circumstances nothing was\r\naccomplished by sea or land for some months. The Plenipotentiary,\r\never engaged in futile negotiations with the Chinese, could not bring\r\nhimself to accept the active policy pressed upon him by Sir Hugh\r\nGough, who pointed out that the Emperor of China would never respect\r\nus until the expedition had forced a passage up the great waterway of\r\nthe Yang-Tse-Kiang, and struck a vigorous blow at the heart of the\r\nCelestial Empire. A great typhoon drove many ships ashore, dismasted\r\nothers, and blew down part of the settlement at Hong Kong. Malarial\r\nfever, caught in the rice grounds around Canton, became so prevalent\r\nthat at one time two-thirds of the troops were unfit for duty. The\r\nRoyal Irish did not suffer more than other corps, yet on August 1,\r\nsix weeks after a draft had raised their strength to 747 all told,\r\n136 of the regiment were in hospital, and three officers died.[130]\r\nWith the arrival of Sir Henry Pottinger, the new Plenipotentiary, the\r\naspect of affairs changed; and on the 21st of August the regiment\r\nformed part of the column embarked for the attack of Amoy--a\r\nseaport three hundred miles up the coast towards the mouth of the\r\nYang-Tse-Kiang. The position of Amoy is naturally strong, and since\r\nthe beginning of the war it had been so greatly fortified that, after\r\nit was taken, soldiers and sailors agreed that it would have proved\r\nimpregnable had it been defended by Europeans. Amoy stands at the\r\nhead of a bay studded with islands, the most considerable of which,\r\nKulangsu, commands both the city and the strait or channel, only six\r\nhundred yards in width, by which the inner harbour is entered. From\r\nevery island and from every headland guns frowned upon the bay, and,\r\nto quote Gough’s biographer--\r\n\r\n  “immediately in front of the outer town stood a succession of\r\n  batteries, and from these there extended a solid rampart, facing\r\n  the sea, about a mile in length. It was, says an eye-witness,\r\n  ‘well built of granite, faced with earth, extending along the\r\n  shore nearly up to the suburbs of the city, and designed to\r\n  command the passage to the harbour. It presented a line of\r\n  guns, a full mile in length, the embrasures being covered with\r\n  large slabs of stone protected by earth heaped upon them, and\r\n  mounting no less than ninety-six guns.’ The end of this rampart\r\n  was connected by a castellated wall with a range of rocky\r\n  heights running parallel to the beach and the rampart, which\r\n  was thus protected from a flanking attack.... On the island of\r\n  Kulangsu there were several strong batteries, mounting altogether\r\n  seventy-six guns, and some of these faced the long stone rampart\r\n  on the opposite side of the strait, thus exposing the assailants\r\n  to a cross-fire.”[131]\r\n\r\nThe naval and military commanders decided that the works of Amoy\r\nand Kulangsu should be attacked at the same time; the ships were to\r\nbombard them in front, while the troops took them in reverse. The\r\nmorning of the 26th of August saw the plan carried into effect: the\r\nbatteries at Kulangsu fell easily into our hands: those at Amoy were\r\nso strongly built that though two line-of-battle ships poured many\r\nthousands of projectiles into them at 400 yards’ range, the masonry\r\nwas practically uninjured. The cannonade, however, served its purpose\r\nin preventing the Chinese gunners from sinking the boats in which\r\nthe XVIIIth and 49th were carried to their appointed landing-place\r\nat the foot of the castellated wall. While the Royal Irish, scaling\r\nthis wall, turned the flank of the works on the sea front, the 49th\r\nrushed along the shore and scrambled over the parapet of the great\r\nbattery; both regiments swept the work from end to end, driving the\r\nChinese before them, and then joined the Marines, who had occupied\r\nthe heights. Here they commanded the “outer city”; but the “inner\r\ncity” was protected by a range of hills occupied by a large number\r\nof the enemy. Gough ordered the 49th to turn these hills, and sent\r\nthe XVIIIth straight at the Chinese, up a steep gorge where a few men\r\ncould have checked a regiment. The Chinese, however, made a very poor\r\nresistance; the troops bivouacked on the heights, and next morning\r\noccupied the citadel and “inner city” of Amoy. The total British loss\r\nwas seventeen killed and wounded; among the latter were two men of\r\nthe Royal Irish. The Chinese suffered severely, and several of their\r\nleaders committed suicide rather than accept defeat.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the XVIIIth on this occasion are amusingly\r\ndescribed by Lieutenant A. Murray, the officer in command of the\r\npicked shots of the regiment, who throughout the campaign worked\r\ntogether under his orders--\r\n\r\n  “We got into boats about 12 o’clock, and were taken in tow by\r\n  the steamer _Nemesis_,[132] and as we had to go to the different\r\n  ships to collect the men, we were towed about the harbour for a\r\n  long time, at the imminent risk of being capsized, as the string\r\n  of boats increased every minute, and consequently threading our\r\n  way through the fleet became more dangerous. I cut one boat\r\n  adrift to prevent her sinking us, as she was twice our size and\r\n  was pounding us to pieces, the Colours of the regiment being in\r\n  the boat with me.... The steamer stood pretty closely into the\r\n  shore, and the boats cast off, the _Nemesis_ covering our landing\r\n  with her guns and rockets. Our Grenadier and Light companies, and\r\n  marksmen, under the command of Major Tomlinson, were ordered to\r\n  move to the front to take the flanking wall of the battery, which\r\n  was done very easily, and they (_i.e._, the Chinese) only fired\r\n  a few shots and a volley of rockets. We got over the wall by\r\n  stepping on each others’ backs. On seeing us come over the wall\r\n  the Chinese, who till then had stood to their guns, ... now ran\r\n  in all directions, throwing their large shields over their backs.”\r\n\r\nAfter capturing a Mandarin’s flag Murray followed the grenadier and\r\nlight companies along the rear of the batteries, where a number of\r\nthe enemy came at them boldly; the Chinese were soon dispersed,\r\nhowever, and fell back to a clump of aloe bushes, from which they\r\nwere driven by a second charge. Of the bivouac Murray writes--\r\n\r\n  “It was almost night when we reached the summit of the heights\r\n  and there were ordered to halt for the night. This was rather\r\n  a pleasant look-out for tired and hungry men, without anything\r\n  to eat or a house to sleep in, with a bitter cold wind blowing;\r\n  however there was nothing for it but to choose the softest\r\n  possible rock, light a cheroot and fancy yourself comfortable for\r\n  the night.... There was great picking and choosing among us for\r\n  soft rocks; but I believe we all came to the conclusion that one\r\n  rock is as hard a pillow as another.”[133]\r\n\r\nAfter destroying the batteries and securing the five hundred guns\r\ncaptured at Amoy, the expeditionary force put to sea, leaving as\r\ngarrison of Kulangsu 361 officers and men of the XVIIIth under\r\nMajor J. Cowper, part of the 26th, and a detachment of artillery--a\r\ntotal of 550 of all ranks. The intention was to attack the towns of\r\nChinhai and Ningpo, and then, in order to efface the bad impression\r\nproduced by our evacuation of Chusan at the beginning of the year,\r\nto re-occupy that island. Bad weather, however, scattered the ships,\r\nand, when at length they were reassembled it was decided at once to\r\nseize Tinghae, the capital of Chusan, before the Chinese had finished\r\ntheir preparations for its defence. Since we had abandoned it our\r\nenemy had fortified the town assiduously. On the sea wall facing the\r\nharbour a battery of eighty guns had been thrown up. On the west it\r\nended at the base of an eminence, in our previous occupation known\r\nas Pagoda Hill, where cannon were now mounted; to the eastward it\r\nstretched almost to the foot of a line of heights, entrenched but\r\nnot yet armed. Gough decided to land at the foot of these heights,\r\nand after carrying them to push some of the troops against the\r\ntown, while others attacked the long battery from flank and rear.\r\nThe ships were to avoid the fire of the guns on the sea front by\r\ntaking up their stations on the outer flanks of Pagoda Hill and the\r\neastern heights. The fleet came into action on October 1, 1841,\r\nand covered by their bombardment three hundred of the Royal Irish\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Adams, the newly arrived 55th regiment,\r\nand eight guns of the Madras Artillery disembarked under a heavy\r\nthough ill-aimed fire of matchlocks and gingals. The 55th won the\r\neastern heights, though not without difficulty, for the garrison of\r\nTinghae were soldiers of a better stamp than the defenders of Amoy.\r\nThe Royal Irish were sent off to the right, marching in quarter\r\ncolumn and covered by the flank companies and picked marksmen, who\r\nran into the enemy at an encampment near the long battery. Here the\r\nChinese showed fight, and lost considerably in hand-to-hand work.\r\nMurray relates that a “white-buttoned” Mandarin,[134] after wounding\r\none of the marksmen in the chest with a spear, “closed with him and\r\ngot his forage cap off, another man came up and thrust at him with\r\na bayonet, which he wrenched off, but was shot by a third.” While\r\nthe sharpshooters were thus employed the grenadier company had made\r\nits way into the long battery, where there was a sharp skirmish at\r\nclose quarters round a gun. The Chinese stood bravely, and were\r\nnot dislodged until another company of the regiment came up at the\r\ndouble, when they fell back, leaving the ground covered with their\r\nown wounded and a few of the XVIIIth. In this little fight pistols\r\nwere used with effect. A Chinaman ran at Murray, sword in hand, but\r\nas the hero of the adventure writes, “having no particular confidence\r\nin my regulation spit, or perhaps in my own skill as a swordsman,\r\nI stuck my sword in the mud beside me, took a steady aim, and shot\r\nhim.” As soon as the Royal Irish had cleared the long battery of\r\nthe enemy they climbed Pagoda Hill, to find that its garrison had\r\nbeen driven away by the shot and shell of the men-of-war and the\r\nartillery. As the Colours of the XVIIIth were raised on the top of\r\nthe hill, those of the 55th began to float over the walls of Tinghae,\r\nand the capital of Chusan once more passed into our hands at the cost\r\nof some thirty killed and wounded. In the XVIIIth the casualties\r\nwere a sergeant and six rank and file wounded. The loss of Chusan\r\ngreatly annoyed the Chinese, who complained that we had not fought\r\nthem fairly. Instead of anchoring our ships right under the cannon\r\nof the long battery and making a frontal attack by sea and land, as\r\nthey expected, we had meanly bombarded the extreme ends of their\r\nline of defence, landed where their guns could not play upon us, and\r\ntaken the battery in flank. Had cricket been one of the national\r\ninstitutions of China, the beaten troops would doubtless have said\r\nthat we had not played the game!\r\n\r\nLeaving an adequate garrison in Chusan General Gough next attacked\r\nChinhai, a seaport at the mouth of the Ningpo river, twelve miles\r\nfrom the important city of Ningpo. Its fortifications, though strong,\r\nwere easily turned on the 10th of October, when the place was taken\r\nwith a total loss of four killed and sixteen wounded. One man in the\r\nRoyal Irish was killed[135] and four wounded. The Chinese suffered\r\nvery heavily, for here, as elsewhere in the campaign, their arms\r\nwere as indifferent as their shooting, and after standing well for a\r\ntime they broke before a charge, and were then mowed down in every\r\ndirection. The slaughter of the fugitives was a hideous necessity:\r\nwe were but a handful in an enormous country, and our enemies were\r\nso numerous that we should have been overwhelmed by numbers had we\r\nnot inflicted severe punishment upon them in every engagement. To the\r\nbad marksmanship of the Chinese must be attributed the XVIIIth’s good\r\nluck on this occasion. As the Royal Irish approached the range of\r\nstrongly held hills which they were to seize, they found themselves\r\non the bank of an unfordable canal, well under the enemy’s fire.\r\nThis canal was spanned by a bridge, narrow in itself, and made\r\nstill narrower by an arch across it; the archway was blocked by a\r\nlarge stone, and even after this obstruction had been removed the\r\npassage was so small that the men had to take off their great-coats\r\nin order to squeeze through it one by one. “We had one or two very\r\nstout fellows,” wrote one of the officers present, “whom we had\r\ngreat difficulty in pushing through, but when we came to the big\r\ndrum we _were_ in a fix. However, we got a little boat, and put\r\nMcGiff, the big drummer, and his drum into it, with a pole to shove\r\nhimself across. The Chinese thought the big drum was some new form of\r\ninfernal machine, and opened a tremendous fire upon it, much to our\r\namusement, but it was anything but fun for McGiff. He and the drum,\r\nhowever, got over safe and sound, except the drum heads, which were\r\nmuch damaged by bullets.”\r\n\r\nThree days later Ningpo fell without a shot being fired, and the\r\nlittle army was played into the town by the band of the XVIIIth.\r\nHere Gough was obliged to halt: much as he desired to push on to\r\nthe banks of the Yang-Tse-Kiang he could not do so without troops,\r\nand sickness, casualties, and the drain of the garrisons of Hong\r\nKong, Kulangsu, Tinghae, and Chinhai had left him with only about\r\nseven hundred and fifty men in hand. With so slender a force he\r\ncould do nothing but await reinforcements; and for several months\r\nthe headquarters of the XVIIIth and 49th remained at Ningpo,\r\noccasionally employed in demonstrations to postpone the attack\r\nwhich, as he rightly anticipated, could not be long delayed. Beyond\r\nthese demonstrations there was little to break the monotony of\r\nexistence in this Chinese city. The duty was heavy. Nearly five\r\nmiles of continuous wall, twenty-seven feet high, twenty feet broad,\r\nand broken only by six gates, surrounded the town: each of these\r\nentrances required a strong guard; the town was patrolled several\r\ntimes during the twenty-four hours; and the field officer and captain\r\nof the day, mounted on sure-footed Chinese ponies, rode frequently\r\nround the ramparts to visit ground which could not be watched by\r\nthe sentries on the gates. Once a week the Colours were trooped in\r\nthe presence of the General, who insisted on the attendance of all\r\nofficers not otherwise employed. When troops were available there\r\nwas drill in a large square, to the great delight of a number of\r\nlittle native boys who had attached themselves to the Royal Irish.\r\nThese children hung about the temple, which had been converted into\r\na barrack, and did odd jobs for the men, helping them to cook and to\r\ncarry dinners to the guards. In return for these kind offices the\r\nsoldiers made pets of the boys, and taught them military expressions\r\nwith such assiduity that in a short time “almost all the young\r\nblackguards about the place could swear in very good English.” These\r\nyoungsters proved their friendship with the XVIIIth by confirming\r\nthe rumours, already current, that during the absence of Sir Hugh\r\nGough, who had been summoned to a conference at Chusan with Sir\r\nHenry Pottinger, a great army was about to attack Ningpo; and after\r\nwarning their soldier friends that next day there was going to be\r\na great fight, they disappeared. This warning was repeated by the\r\ntraders in the market, who drew their hands across their throats to\r\ngive their British customers to understand that all the “Barbarians”\r\nwould soon be killed. In the night of March 9-10, 1842, large bodies\r\nof the enemy simultaneously assaulted the south and west gates. The\r\nattack on the former was successful; the Chinese forced it open,\r\nrouted the guard, and were making their way into the centre of the\r\ntown when they were met by part of the 49th, who drove them through\r\nthe gate and back into the suburbs with heavy loss. The west gate\r\nwas held by Lieutenant A. W. S. F. Armstrong and twenty-eight men\r\nof the XVIIIth, carefully picked among the best soldiers of the\r\nregiment by the adjutant, Lieutenant Graves, who, like every one\r\nof the garrison at Ningpo except the officer in temporary command,\r\nhad realised that there was trouble in the air. Five minutes after\r\nthe bugles had sounded the alarm the Royal Irish were on parade,\r\nand two companies went off at the double to reinforce Armstrong’s\r\nguard, who, owing to the construction of the parapet, were unable to\r\nfire down upon the Tartars as they strove to lever the gate off its\r\nhinges with crowbars and axes. Suddenly among the defenders appeared\r\na private, Michael Cushin, described as a first-class soldier with\r\nonly one failing, who seems to have been the hero of the defence. He\r\nhad been imprisoned for drunkenness at the west gate, and when the\r\nattack began, begged to be released. As soon as his cell was opened,\r\nhe wrenched the bar off the door and began to use it on the Tartars’\r\nheads: next he killed the officer commanding a party of the enemy on\r\nthe point of clambering over the parapet: then his quick wits solved\r\nthe problem of the ill-planned rampart. Collecting ten or twelve\r\nmen, they put their shoulders to the part of it which overhung the\r\ngate, and with a few great heaves topped the mass of masonry into\r\nthe crowd below.[136] Through the gap thus made the guard began to\r\nply their muskets, and when the supports arrived with a light gun, a\r\nmurderous fire was opened upon the Tartars, who sullenly abandoned\r\nthe assault and retired, leaving two silk banners as trophies in the\r\nhands of the XVIIIth. After the south gate had been re-occupied a\r\nhandful of British soldiers, among whom were some of the Royal Irish,\r\npushed their way through the town, and near one of the gates found a\r\ngreat number of the enemy drawn up across the street. The infantry\r\nreserved their volley until twenty yards from the Tartars, the guns\r\nfired canister at fifty yards’ range, and a party of the regiment,\r\nunder Lieutenant Murray, after breaking through a house and fording a\r\ncanal, occupied the side streets of the thoroughfare down which the\r\nenemy was driven, and by their musketry contributed much to his great\r\nlosses. For six miles the Tartars were hunted, first through the\r\nsuburb and then in the open country, but there was no fight left in\r\nthem, and the civilian inhabitants who crowded the streets and roads\r\ngave them no help, and appeared to regard the fighting as a spectacle\r\narranged for their own amusement. The attitude of most of the Chinese\r\nthroughout the campaign, indeed, was one of complete apathy: they\r\nlooked upon the war as an annoying but unavoidable interruption to\r\ntheir daily life, and finding that their conquerors treated them\r\nwell, acquiesced in their presence, and made as much money out of\r\nthem as possible.\r\n\r\nThe enemy attacked Chinhai about the same time that he attempted\r\nto wrest Ningpo from us, but was beaten off with ease by the\r\ngarrison, largely composed of a detachment of the Royal Irish\r\nunder Brevet-Major Grattan. A few days after these exciting little\r\nepisodes, the XVIIIth was present at successful raids against\r\nthe town of Tze-Ke and other places near Ningpo; but as those of\r\nthe Royal Irish who were in the column hardly came into action\r\nit is unnecessary to describe these skirmishes. About this time\r\nColonel Adams, being invalided home, was succeeded in command by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel N. R. Tomlinson; and in the month of April three\r\ncompanies of the detachment at Kulangsu rejoined headquarters.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that ever since Sir Hugh Gough’s\r\narrival he had pointed out that the war would never be brought to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion until, abandoning the policy of attacking\r\nonly the towns on the sea-coast, we pushed our way into the heart\r\nof the country, and threatened the Emperor in his palace at Pekin.\r\nAfter much correspondence between the Ministry at home and the\r\nGovernor-General of India at Calcutta, Gough’s strategy was adopted,\r\nand in May, 1842, the XVIIIth was afloat again, this time bound for\r\nChapoo, where a naval arsenal was to be destroyed before the fleet\r\nentered the river Yang-Tse-Kiang. The place was strongly fortified,\r\nbut, as usual, the enemy proved unprepared for anything but a frontal\r\nattack, and as soon as his works were turned on the 18th of May he\r\nwas easily routed, except at one point, where the stubborn valour of\r\nthe Tartar soldiery cost the regiment dear. Finding their retreat\r\ncut off, three hundred of these men flung themselves into a large\r\nstone house, and determined to take no quarter but to fight to the\r\nbitter end. The building was quickly and skilfully prepared for\r\ndefence. The outer windows were manned by picked shots; the interior\r\npassages and the central hall were loopholed; mats were hung to\r\nexclude the light, so that if the British succeeded in making their\r\nway across the threshold they would plunge into semi-darkness, and\r\nnot see the loopholes from which they would be shot down by a cross\r\nfire. A party of the Royal Irish tried to force their way into this\r\ndeath-trap, but were so warmly received that Lieutenant Murray, who\r\nwas in command, drew off his men to wait for reinforcements; and\r\nafter a similar attempt by some of the 49th had been repulsed, the\r\nhouse was surrounded by skirmishers to prevent the escape of any of\r\nthe enemy. Before long, more companies of the XVIIIth and 49th came\r\non the scene, and the officer in command of the latter corps, who was\r\nthe senior officer present, decided not to press the attack until\r\nthe Tartars had been shaken by artillery. The decision was a wise\r\none, but unfortunately Lieutenant-Colonel Tomlinson overheard some\r\nexpressions which he considered a reflection either upon his regiment\r\nor himself, and instantly led a headlong charge towards the entrance\r\nof the house. At the door he fell, so desperately injured that in\r\nfive minutes he had ceased to breathe, while every man who tried\r\nto enter with him was killed or wounded. After he was shot down it\r\nbecame almost impossible to prevent the XVIIIth from rushing madly at\r\nthe building, for the men burned to avenge their Colonel, whom they\r\ndescribed as “the best officer who ever said ‘Come on’ to a grenadier\r\ncompany.” In more formal language General Gough recorded the same\r\nopinion, saying in his despatch that Tomlinson fell “in full career\r\nof renown, honoured by the corps, and lamented by all.”\r\n\r\nWhen a few artillerymen came up with a light gun and some rockets\r\nthey opened on the house, but without result; equally fruitless were\r\nthe efforts of a party of sailors to set fire to the woodwork of\r\nthe upper storeys; then the explosion of a powder-bag made a small\r\nbreach in a wall through which a few of the Royal Irish tried to\r\nforce their way, only to be driven back with loss. A second attempt\r\nto set fire to the woodwork, however, was more successful, and the\r\nexplosion of another powder-bag brought down more of the wall, and\r\nthus exposed many of the Tartars to our musketry. Soon the whole\r\nplace was in a blaze, and when at last our men rushed through the\r\ndoorway from which they had been so often repulsed, they found\r\nthemselves in a hell on Earth. Three hundred Tartars had defended\r\nthe building; now all but fifty-three lay dead upon the floor; and\r\nof the survivors nearly all were wounded. Many of their wadded\r\ncotton uniforms had taken fire, and to the horrors of the reek of\r\nblood and the stench of singeing flesh were added the cries of the\r\nwounded, as they feebly strove to beat out the sparks which fell\r\nfrom the roof upon their clothing. In the midst of this scene of\r\ncarnage sat an old Tartar colonel, who, when the red-coats began to\r\nshow through the smoke, laid down his pipe, snatched up his sword,\r\nand cut his throat. This stout old warrior failed to kill himself,\r\nand with the rest of the wounded was tended by our doctors, and then\r\nreleased--a chivalrous recognition of their bravery which greatly\r\nastonished the prisoners and convinced them that the “foreign devils”\r\nwere not as black as the Mandarins had painted them. The discovery,\r\nunfortunately, came too late to prevent an epidemic of suicide\r\namong the population of Chapoo. When our men entered the town it\r\nwas full of dead: “men, women, and children were found drowned or\r\nhanged; whole families seemed to have destroyed themselves, and some,\r\nfrom the positions they were in, must have had difficulty and most\r\ndesperate resolution to effect their purpose. The wells and every\r\nplace where they could find water enough were full of bodies.”[137]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are believed to have fought Gough’s little army of\r\n2200 men[138] at Chapoo with 8000 regular troops, 1700 of whom\r\nwere Tartars. Their losses were, as usual, enormous--from 1200\r\nto 1500--while those of the British were two officers and eleven\r\nother ranks killed, six officers and forty-six other ranks wounded.\r\nThe casualties among the XVIIIth were heavy: Colonel Tomlinson, a\r\nsergeant, and three privates were killed;[139] Lieutenants A. Murray\r\nand E. Jodrell, a sergeant, a drummer, and twenty-seven rank and file\r\nwere wounded. One of the pay-sergeants had a very narrow escape: he\r\nwas in the habit of carrying the company roll in his forage cap, and\r\nwhen at nightfall he wanted to make entries in it he found it cut to\r\npieces by bullets.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the arsenal, guns, and other munitions of war at Chapoo\r\nwere destroyed, the expedition made sail for the Yang-Tse-Kiang,\r\nwhere we bombarded Woosung, a town at the mouth of the river of\r\nthe same name. Though small, the place was heavily fortified, for\r\nthe Chinese trusted to its guns for the protection of the lower\r\nreaches of the river. In the capture of Woosung the army played no\r\npart, for the troopships were aground on mud-banks when the sailors\r\nand marines, after knocking the batteries to pieces, landed to take\r\npossession of the town. Two days later, on the 19th of June, the\r\nRoyal Irish formed part of a column which marched fourteen miles\r\ninland to Shanghai, destroyed the warlike stores at this great\r\ncentre of trade, and then returned to Woosung, to find that during\r\ntheir short absence some batteries of Royal Artillery, the 98th,\r\nand several Madras regiments had joined the force, and that Major\r\nJ. Cowper had come up from Kulangsu to take command of the XVIIIth,\r\nbringing with him the company which had been left to garrison\r\nChinhai. The fleet remained storm-bound at Woosung until the 7th\r\nof July: then the weather moderated, and the Admiral, Sir William\r\nParker, ordered his seventy vessels--men-of-war, transports, and\r\nstore ships--to weigh anchor for Nankin, now the object of our\r\noperations. This enormous city was the commercial capital of China,\r\nand the centre of a great network of canals connecting Pekin with the\r\nYang-Tse-Kiang and the southern provinces of the Empire. Once masters\r\nof Nankin, we could stop all inland traffic on the canals, and by\r\nparalysing the commerce of the country bring irresistible pressure\r\non the Emperor, six hundred miles away in his Court at Pekin. The\r\ntask before the Navy was a heavy one. In peace time the mere passage\r\nof so large a number of ships over a hundred and seventy miles of an\r\nalmost unknown river would have presented difficulties. Now these\r\ndifficulties were increased by the necessity of guarding against\r\nattack, and by the knowledge that before the guns of the fleet could\r\nbe trained upon the walls of Nankin we would have to fight the\r\ngarrison of at least one large town on the banks of the river. The\r\nsteamers scouted upstream, sounding and surveying as they went: the\r\nsailing ships followed in a stately procession many miles in length,\r\nwatched by crowds of peasants who gazed in wonder at the “war junks”\r\nof the Barbarians. On the 20th of July, the rearmost of the fleet\r\nreached Chinkiangfu, a walled city fifty miles below Nankin; and\r\nnext day Gough landed his troops, now numbering 6664 men. The first\r\nbrigade (Major-General Lord Saltoun) was to clear the enemy from a\r\ncamp south-west of the town; with the second, Major-General Schoedde\r\nwas to attack the northern wall of the town; to Bartley’s brigade\r\n(the third) was entrusted the storming of the western wall. The first\r\nbrigade did its work easily; the second had hard fighting before\r\nits bayonets glittered on the northern wall; the third brigade, and\r\nespecially the XVIIIth regiment, had exciting adventures in carrying\r\nout the duty assigned to them.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were the last troops to disembark. They did not land\r\ntill seven A.M., when the heat was already so oppressive that the\r\nAdjutant, Lieutenant Graves, persuaded Major Cowper to leave the\r\nmen’s great-coats behind, undertaking to provide the entire regiment\r\nwith furs from the shops of the pawnbrokers, with whom the wealthy\r\nChinese regularly stored their winter clothing. To go into action\r\nwithout great-coats was quite a new departure, but even more daring\r\nwas the next order: the men were told to take off their stocks, sling\r\nthem over the left shoulder, and unfasten three buttons of their\r\njackets and three buttons of their collars! These precautions, though\r\nto our ideas not very far-reaching, served their purpose, for while\r\nin other corps numbers of men were knocked over by the heat, not a\r\nman in the XVIIIth suffered from sunstroke. The regiment was making\r\nits way through the suburbs to the western face of the wall, when\r\nan A.D.C. arrived with orders for the Royal Irish to come up at the\r\ndouble to the western gate, where the General was anxiously awaiting\r\nthem. The troops around General Gough were in bad case: many lay\r\nsenseless from sun apoplexy; the remainder were so exhausted that\r\nthey could only keep up a feeble fire on its defenders. As soon as\r\nthe XVIIIth appeared Gough welcomed them with the order “Go on, Royal\r\nIrish, and storm.” “We halted,” writes an officer who was present,\r\n“to tell off a storming party of fifty men, and then with arms at the\r\ntrail and bending low, the stormers made a dash down a cross-street\r\nwithin about twenty yards of the gate, and from the windows of the\r\nhouses which ran parallel to the wall, we opened fire on the Chinese\r\ngunners and soon silenced them. The engineers then advanced and\r\nplaced a powder-bag against the gate (a very strong one and, as we\r\nafterwards found, strengthened by four or five tiers of sand-bags\r\npiled against it from inside); we were ordered to lie down; the fuse\r\nwas lit, and in about ten seconds everything was flying about our\r\nheads. This brought us to our feet in a hurry; we gave a cheer and\r\ndashed into the archway, which was densely filled with smoke; those\r\nwho got in first were soon brought to their knees by kicking against\r\nthe sand-bags which we could not see, but we had to scramble on as\r\nquick as possible as there was danger of receiving a poke from a\r\nfriendly bayonet behind! We got out as black as monkeys, to find\r\nourselves in a sort of yard, surrounded by high walls, with a second\r\ngate leading from it into the city. We had just started breaking this\r\nsecond gate down, when we heard a friendly voice behind it shouting\r\n‘Hold on, we’ll open it for you!’” It turned out that the 55th, after\r\nescalading their own wall, had worked round to the western gate,\r\nwhich the Chinese abandoned when they saw their flank in danger.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were at once sent to drive the Tartars from the\r\nwestern wall. They moved off left in front,[140] and as there was not\r\nroom on the rampart for four men abreast they marched in threes. The\r\ngrenadier company were soon dropped to hold a commanding building\r\nclose to the wall; the remainder of the regiment pushed on without\r\nseeing any of the enemy, until a keen-eyed officer noticed a large\r\nnumber of Tartars emerging from the shelter of some houses on the\r\ntown side of the wall. The commanding officer, insisting that they\r\nwere not fighting men but harmless coolies, refused to send out\r\nskirmishers to protect the head and right flank of his straggling\r\ncolumn, and the Tartars were allowed to establish themselves in\r\ngardens surrounded by high walls, which made excellent rests for\r\nmatchlocks and gingals. As soon as the regiment was within range\r\nthey opened a heavy fire upon the leading company, killing Captain\r\nC. J. R. Collinson, wounding Lieutenant S. Bernard, and causing\r\nseveral casualties in the ranks. The rampart along which the XVIIIth\r\nwas marching was so narrow that it was difficult for messengers\r\nto pass rapidly from company to company, and as no orders were\r\nreceived the men halted for directions: but by the time the enemy\r\nhad discharged a second volley, an officer had called upon the Light\r\ncompany to avenge their captain. Collinson’s “Light Bobs” dashed\r\ndown the slope of the rampart, scaled the mud walls and, followed by\r\nthe remainder of the regiment, fell furiously on the Tartars, who,\r\nafter a stout resistance, broke and fled. Not all, however, of the\r\nenemy had lost heart. Just as the regiment had re-formed after the\r\ncharge, a gigantic Tartar rushed towards the line, brandishing a\r\nsword in each hand; the officers, unwilling to send so brave a man\r\nto his death, made signs to him to retire, but in vain, and he was\r\nalmost amongst the men when a well-aimed bullet laid him low. The\r\ngrenadier company came in for a full share of the excitements of the\r\nday. Their captain, Wigston, noticed some of the Tartars drawn up\r\nacross a narrow street leading to his post, and sent a subaltern,\r\nLieutenant W. Venour, and twelve men to dislodge them. The Tartars\r\nheld their fire until the party of grenadiers were close to them, and\r\nthen let fly with some effect. Lieutenant I. H. Hewitt with fourteen\r\nmen hurried up to reinforce Venour’s detachment, and the street\r\nwas cleared after sharp hand-to-hand fighting. Hewitt had a narrow\r\nescape: a Tartar cut at him with his sword, and the blow would have\r\nbeen fatal had not Private M‘Carthy “raised his musket and parried\r\nit, though unfortunately with the loss of his thumb, the sword\r\ncutting right through the bone, and also through Hewitt’s forage\r\ncap, slightly raising the skin of his head. We left a picket there,”\r\ncontinues Lieutenant Murray, “as occasional shots were still fired\r\nfrom the houses. A short time afterwards a Tartar soldier rushed in\r\namongst the men and stabbed one of them in the side with his knife:\r\nhe was shot instantly. We were obliged to set fire to the houses to\r\ndrive the Tartars out of them, for we would not let the men follow\r\nthem into the buildings.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the troops did their best to stop the frenzy of rage and\r\nterror which seized upon the population after we had captured the\r\ntown, the number of people who committed suicide at Chinkiangfu\r\nwas as great or even greater than at Chapoo. One instance among\r\nhundreds will prove how determined the Tartars were not to survive\r\nthe disgrace of a defeat. When their General realised that the day\r\nwas lost he retired to his house, ordered his servants to set fire\r\nto the building, and allowed himself to be burned to death. It was\r\nfortunate for the success of Gough’s little army that the overweening\r\ncontempt of the Chinese for foreigners had prevented the employment\r\nof European adventurers to mould and lead their armies. Had the\r\nTartar troops been trained and disciplined by Continental soldiers of\r\nfortune, as were the Sikhs, the enemies whom Gough was to encounter\r\nin a few years, a great array of British soldiers would have been\r\nrequired to win on the banks of the Yang-Tse-Kiang victories as\r\ndecisive as those of Sobraon and Goozerat.[141] In the capture of\r\nChinkiangfu two officers and thirty of the other ranks were killed,\r\neleven officers and ninety-eight other ranks wounded, and three\r\nprivates missing. The casualties among the small Naval landing party\r\nwere three killed and twenty-one wounded. The XVIIIth lost one\r\nofficer, Captain Collinson, and two private soldiers killed; one\r\nofficer, Lieutenant S. Bernard, two sergeants, and fifteen privates\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiers were fighting on shore, the sailors were doing\r\ninvaluable work on their own element by blockading the chief\r\nwaterways to Pekin; and in a few days the result of the stoppage\r\nof trade with the capital was so disastrous to the merchants of\r\nChina that the Emperor was obliged to sue for peace. But before\r\nnegotiations had been opened, Pottinger, Gough, and Parker realised\r\nthat the presence of British troops and British ships at Nankin would\r\ngreatly stimulate the tardy movements of the Chinese diplomatists,\r\nand on August 9, 1842, the whole force, less a small garrison left to\r\nhold Chinkiangfu, was ready to assault the walls of the commercial\r\ncapital of China. But no assault was necessary, as twenty days\r\nlater a treaty of peace, this time a genuine one on the part of the\r\nChinese, was signed on board a British man-of-war. Its terms were\r\nsatisfactory: every point on which England had gone to war was ceded\r\nby the Emperor; our national honour was vindicated, and the rights\r\nof our traders secured. During the negotiations dignified courtesies\r\nwere exchanged between the Mandarins and the Plenipotentiary. On one\r\nof these occasions the grenadier company of the Royal Irish acted\r\nas guard of honour to Sir Henry Pottinger while he solemnly dined\r\nwith the Chinese officials: our late enemies turned out their best\r\nsoldiers to receive the English guests, but though Lieutenant Murray\r\nadmits that among them were many tall, fine-looking fellows, he\r\ninsists that they were “nothing in appearance to our company, who\r\nlooked remarkably well, and must have astonished the Chinese much.”\r\nThough the spectators doubtless admired the physique and martial\r\nbearing of the Irishmen who had so often routed the picked troops of\r\nChina, they must have smiled at the contrast between the comfortable\r\ndress of the Tartars, who wore long loose coats and boots coming\r\nwell up the leg, and the stocks, tightly buttoned shell-jackets and\r\nequally tight white trousers of the British army.[142] The spies\r\namong the crowd, for the Chinese had many very observant secret\r\nservice agents in their employ, must have wondered why the infantry\r\nwho served on board ship were armed with percussion muskets, while\r\nthose who fought on land carried flint-locks.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the treaty of peace been officially ratified by\r\nthe Emperor of China than the expedition began to descend the\r\nYang-Tse-Kiang with all speed, for the climate had begun to\r\ntell heavily upon the health of soldiers and sailors alike. So\r\nshort-handed from sickness was the crew of H.M.S. _Rattlesnake_ that\r\nthe Royal Irish, by this time nearly as much at home on a ship as\r\nin a barrack, helped largely in working her successfully down the\r\nriver. At the mouth of the Yang-Tse-Kiang the expedition broke up:\r\nsome of Gough’s units sailed for India; others went home, while\r\nthe corps ordered to remain in Chinese waters proceeded to their\r\nseveral destinations. Among the latter was the XVIIIth, which was\r\nsent to Chusan, where its various detachments were assembled by the\r\nend of October, 1842. When the casualty returns were prepared it\r\nwas found that though the losses in action had been small, those\r\ncaused by dysentery, malaria, and cholera had been very heavy.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel N. R. Tomlinson and Captain C. J. R. Collinson had\r\nbeen killed; Major R. Hammill, Lieutenants H. Vavasour, A. Wilson, F.\r\nSwinburn, D. Edwardes, J. Cochrane, G. W. Davis, S. Haly, Hon. C. H.\r\nStratford, Ensign M. Humphreys, and Assistant-Surgeon J. Baker had\r\ndied from disease; six officers had been wounded but had recovered\r\nfrom their injuries. Among the other ranks nine non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men had been killed, seventy-seven wounded, and two\r\nhundred and fourteen had died from illness, accident, or the\r\neffect of wounds.[143] In honour of those who perished a monument\r\nwas erected in St Patrick’s Cathedral. It stands in the north\r\ntransept--the Walhalla of the regiment, where the old Colours, faded\r\nby the sun in many climes and pierced by bullets in many battles,\r\noverhang the stately memorials by which the Royal Irish regiment has\r\nsought to keep green the memory of its illustrious dead. The numerous\r\nmonuments are described fully in Appendix 10, and photographs of\r\nthem are reproduced in various parts of the book.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Parliament in 1843, the House of Lords passed\r\nthe usual vote of thanks to the troops which had taken part in the\r\ncampaign. A medal was issued to the officers and men who had served\r\nin the Chinese war; leave was granted to the XVIIIth to add to its\r\nother battle honours the word “China” and the device of the Dragon,\r\nand Colonel G. Burrell, Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. Adams, and Majors J.\r\nCowper and J. Grattan were awarded the C.B.\r\n\r\nVery disagreeable orders awaited the regiment on its arrival at\r\nChusan. Four companies were to remain there as part of its garrison\r\nuntil the Chinese had fulfilled all the obligations of the treaty,\r\nwhile headquarters and the greater part of the regiment were to\r\noccupy the island of Kulangsu, which our Government also held as\r\na pledge of Chinese good faith. Kulangsu had already acquired the\r\nreputation of being one of the most unhealthy stations in China, and\r\nthe Royal Irish soon discovered that its evil reputation was but too\r\nwell deserved. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Graves’s statement,\r\nwhen the headquarters companies landed they found the detachment of\r\nthe regiment which had been there for some months in a deplorable\r\ncondition. There had been many deaths among all ranks; every one of\r\nthe surviving officers was down with fever,\r\n\r\n  “and there were not thirty men under command of a sergeant who\r\n  were fit for duty or could shoulder a firelock.... When the\r\n  Headquarter companies landed from Chusan the men were healthy and\r\n  well seasoned, but they very soon began to feel the climate, and\r\n  before long half the men were on the sick list, and we began to\r\n  bury them very fast. I had been appointed Staff Officer for the\r\n  island, and at first found much difficulty in getting coffins\r\n  quick enough, so I ordered twenty at a time to be supplied by a\r\n  contractor at Amoy. Several of our officers died, and at last\r\n  I found much difficulty in getting men enough to relieve the\r\n  guards. I went to our Colonel, Cowper--who was the Commandant of\r\n  the island--and represented that if we did not get a ship sent up\r\n  from Hong Kong for the invalids we should very soon have no men\r\n  for guard. We got a ship and found her of the greatest benefit;\r\n  she was anchored half a mile out of the harbour, and the invalids\r\n  sent on board her came back in a week fit for duty.\r\n\r\n  “A large draft joined from England, about three hundred strong,\r\n  together with the women and children. This caused a little stir,\r\n  but it was a short-lived happiness: they went down almost as\r\n  fast as we could provide coffins for them. We pitched tents and\r\n  moved our camp daily about the island, but it was no use--cholera\r\n  and fever still continued. The men began to drink to drown\r\n  dull care; the officers off the sick list were constantly\r\n  on Court-Martial duty, and the Colonel received an official\r\n  letter from Headquarters drawing his attention to the number\r\n  of Courts-Martial for drunkenness, and directing him to parade\r\n  the regiment and reprimand the men for their conduct, which\r\n  was alleged to be the principal cause of the severe mortality.\r\n  As Staff Officer and adjutant of the regiment I was ordered to\r\n  read this letter to the men, which I began to do, but I must\r\n  acknowledge I fairly broke down and had to hand it to another\r\n  officer to finish. I felt so keenly how our gallant poor fellows\r\n  were being sacrificed, after their long, hard services, to a\r\n  climate no one could live in, and _how_ they bore it!”\r\n\r\nIn April 1844, after a hundred and thirty-six officers and men\r\nhad fallen victims to the climate of Kulangsu,[144] the regiment\r\nwas reunited at Chusan. The next station was Hong Kong, where the\r\nordinary routine of garrison life in the East was suddenly broken\r\nby an urgent and wholly unexpected call to arms. The people of\r\nCanton, always overbearing and offensive towards Europeans, had\r\nrecently insulted and ill-treated British subjects, and their\r\nMandarins had refused to make redress for the outrages. The British\r\nPlenipotentiary, Sir John Davis, was a believer in the saying “A word\r\nand a blow, and the blow first,” and he determined to teach the mob\r\nof Canton a lesson they would not soon forget. During the night of\r\nthe 1st of April, 1847, the Royal Irish, under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCowper, with 23 officers and 509 other ranks, and the 42nd regiment\r\nof Madras Native Infantry, 399 strong, were packed into a couple of\r\nsmall men-of-war and an armed steamer. Early on the following morning\r\nthe flotilla was off the entrance to the Canton river; the troops\r\nwere landed, and driving the Chinese artillerymen from the batteries,\r\nspiked the guns. The works higher up the stream were then treated in\r\nthe same way, but not without vigorous opposition from the enemy,\r\nwhose aim, however, was much distracted by the steady fire of a\r\nparty of the Royal Irish, described in the despatches as the “acting\r\ngunners of the XVIIIth, who replied to the batteries in a style\r\nwhich would have done credit to experienced artillerymen.” As soon\r\nas the ships were off Canton the soldiers occupied the “factories”;\r\nplaced them in a state of defence, and made plans for storming the\r\ntown. The Royal Irish were looking forward to winning much glory (and\r\nmuch prize money too!) in the capture of Canton, when the Mandarins,\r\ngreatly perturbed by Sir John Davis’s prompt reprisals, hastily made\r\nfull atonement for their misdeeds, and the expedition returned to\r\nHong Kong. They had done a good week’s work: 879 guns, many of great\r\ncalibre, had been spiked, much ammunition destroyed, and a greatly\r\nneeded lesson given to the Canton roughs--and all without the loss of\r\na soldier, bluejacket, or marine.\r\n\r\nGeneral D’Aguilar, who was in command, mentioned in his despatch the\r\nfollowing officers of the regiment, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel Cowper;\r\nCaptain J. Bruce, A.A.G.; Captain Clark Kennedy, Acting A.Q.M.;\r\nCaptain J. W. Graves; Captain A. N. Campbell, and Lieutenant E. W.\r\nSargent, Acting A.D.C.\r\n\r\nBefore the troops left Canton the British merchants asked for an\r\nofficer to train their newly formed Volunteer corps. Captain J.\r\nW. Graves was selected, and with part of the Light company spent\r\ntwo months in “the factories,” where between drilling his civilian\r\nrecruits, drawing up plans for the defence of the settlement against\r\na sudden rush, and eating the good dinners to which the merchants\r\ninvited him, his time was fully occupied. Soon after this detachment\r\nrejoined headquarters the regiment was warned to prepare to sail for\r\nIndia, and on November 20, 1847, embarked for Bengal on the transport\r\nship _Balcarres_. Major W. F. Dillon was in command; with him were 24\r\nofficers, 42 sergeants, 15 drummers, and 595 rank and file, and when\r\nhe arrived at Fort William on January 10, 1848, he found awaiting\r\nhim drafts from England amounting to 7 officers, 1 drummer, and 334\r\nrank and file. Thus the XVIIIth began its tour of duty in India with\r\na total strength of one thousand and eighteen of all ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1848-1854.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WAR WITH BURMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment arrived in India the Sikh War\r\nappeared to be over, and all chance of winning fresh laurels seemed\r\nrelegated to the distant future. Further troubles, however, broke\r\nout in the Punjab, and for a time the regiment had every hope of\r\nagain seeing active service under Sir Hugh Gough, as it was ordered\r\nup country and incorporated in the “Army of Reserve” on its arrival\r\nat Umballa in March, 1849. But Gough’s victory at Goozerat[145] had\r\nfinally crushed the power of our gallant foes; the “Army of Reserve”\r\nwas not called upon to take the field, and the Royal Irish remained\r\nat Umballa till the end of 1849, when they marched to Meerut, where a\r\ndraft of two hundred and twenty recruits from home awaited them. The\r\ntwo flank companies did not accompany headquarters, as in November\r\nthey had been sent on an important and interesting duty: they formed\r\nthe European portion of the escort selected to guard the Marquis of\r\nDalhousie, Governor-General of India, in his progress from Rurki\r\nto Lahore, the capital of the great province just added to the\r\nBritish dominions. This detachment of the XVIIIth was commanded by\r\nCaptain C. A. Edwards, who in a statement prepared for this history\r\nmentions that as it was feared fanatics would attempt to murder the\r\nGovernor-General in his sleep, four picked men of the Royal Irish\r\nat night patrolled the space between the inner and outer walls of\r\nLord Dalhousie’s tent. These sentries appear to have been abnormally\r\nceremonious in their manners, for the Governor-General, while warmly\r\npraising their incessant vigilance, said that he had only one fault\r\nto find with them--they _would_ salute him when he was in his\r\ndressing-gown! It is not clear whether Edwards’ party were present at\r\nthe historic scene of Dhuleep Singh’s deposition at Lahore, but they\r\nacted nominally as guard of honour, but virtually as escort to this\r\nimportant prisoner on his journey to Meerut. In the cold weather\r\nof 1850 the regiment was ordered back to Calcutta; from Allahabad\r\nthe journey was by river, in flats towed by small steamers. On its\r\narrival it was quartered in Fort William, where, when all outlying\r\ndetachments had been collected, Colonel Reignolds had under his\r\ncommand a magnificent regiment of eleven hundred and five officers\r\nand men. As it was generally understood that the Royal Irish would\r\nbe ordered home in a few months, many officers obtained leave of\r\nabsence and started for England under the firm impression that for\r\nsome time there would be no more fighting in the East.[146] But the\r\ntruth of the saying “You never know your luck” has seldom been better\r\nillustrated than in the case of the XVIIIth at the beginning of\r\n1852, when the regiment found itself hurried off to take part in an\r\nexpedition to Burma.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this war, the second which the Burmese had forced upon\r\nus in the course of thirty years, were almost identical with those\r\nwhich had brought about the conflict with China, described in the\r\npreceding chapter. Persistent disregard of treaties and systematic\r\noppression of European traders had culminated in maltreatment of\r\nBritish subjects so flagrant that our Government was compelled to\r\nseek redress by arms; and in each theatre of war the prestige of\r\nBritain was re-established by the combined efforts of both branches\r\nof the Service. The dissensions between England and the King of Ava,\r\nas the ruler of Burma was officially described, were brought to a\r\nclimax by the misconduct of one of his lieutenants, the governor of\r\nRangoon, who wantonly imprisoned the master of a British ship, and\r\nexposed him in the stocks to the gibes and insults of an Eastern\r\nrabble. When a squadron demanded reparation for this outrage the\r\nBurmese temporised, but soon so clearly showed they did not mean to\r\nmend their ways that the commodore seized a Burmese ship-of-war and\r\nblockaded the port of Rangoon. The truculent governor retaliated by\r\nconfiscating the property of all British subjects within his reach;\r\nand the sailors thereupon towed their prize to sea under a heavy fire\r\nfrom the stockades on the banks of the Rangoon river. When this news\r\nreached Calcutta the Indian Government at once ordered a combined\r\nnaval and military expedition[147] to rendezvous at the mouth of the\r\nbranch of the Irrawaddy on which Rangoon stands, and on January 19,\r\n1852, Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds with the headquarters and right\r\nwing of the regiment (444 all told) embarked at Calcutta, followed\r\nin a few weeks by Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Coote with the left wing,\r\n518 strong.[148] This was not the first time that the sails of a\r\ngreat British expedition had whitened Burmese waters. In 1824, the\r\nKing of Ava had invaded the territories of the East India Company, an\r\nact of unprovoked aggression punished by the capture of Rangoon, and\r\nfollowed by a long series of operations, in which a very large number\r\nof the British troops perished of disease before the Burmese sued for\r\npeace, and ceded to us the provinces of Aracan and Tenasserim, long\r\nnarrow strips of territory washed respectively by the waters of the\r\nBay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. Rangoon was restored to the King\r\nof Ava, and with it two hundred miles of coast-line that lay like a\r\nwedge between our new dominions.[149]\r\n\r\nIn the first phase of the campaign of 1852-53, the operations were\r\nchiefly confined to the capture of important towns near the mouths\r\nof the great rivers which, rising in the Himalayas, flow through\r\nthe swamps and forests of Burma on their way to the Indian Ocean.\r\nThe war-steamers forced their way up the streams and engaged the\r\nstockades and other defences on the banks; while the soldiers landed,\r\nstormed these works, and then, pushing forward into the jungle,\r\ncarried the towns by assault. While the operations were confined\r\nto the immediate neighbourhood of rivers and navigable creeks no\r\nquestion of land transport arose, but when it became necessary to\r\nsend columns of troops deep into the interior of the country, the\r\ninnumerable difficulties of fighting in a pathless and tropical\r\njungle at once made themselves felt. The ships could indeed bring\r\nstores to the point on the river from which the column struck inland;\r\nthey could hold a base upon which the troops could fall back in case\r\nof need; but there the power of the navy ceased. The wants of the\r\nsoldiers could only be supplied by bullock-carts or elephants, and\r\nthe long lines of transport animals had to wind their way through\r\na densely wooded country, admirably suited to the guerilla tactics\r\nof surprises and ambuscades. Like the Chinese, the Burmans though\r\nbrave as individuals were undisciplined as soldiers, and as a rule\r\npreferred to fight behind ramparts to meeting their enemy in the\r\nfield. In China the garrisons of the cities waited our attack behind\r\nhigh stone walls; in Burma the defenders of the towns manned huge\r\ntimber stockades, in the building of which they were very skilful.\r\nA nation of woodsmen, with their sharp square-pointed swords they\r\ncould hew down forest trees and run up timber barricades with extreme\r\nrapidity, and when time was allowed them they could produce really\r\nformidable fortifications, such as those awaiting the British at\r\nRangoon. These consisted of a substantial rampart, fourteen or\r\nfifteen feet high, about twelve feet wide on the top, and revetted\r\nwithin and without by great teak logs placed vertically, with the\r\nlower ends sunk in the ground. The intervening space was filled with\r\nwell-rammed earth. The logs of the outer revetment stretched up some\r\nsix feet or more above the level of the parapet, every fourth or\r\nfifth log being cut some three feet shorter than the others to form\r\nloopholes and embrasures. There were many flanking towers; traverses\r\nprotected the gates; the ditches were deep, often flooded with\r\nwater, and protected by thick abattis. Guns, varying in calibre from\r\n32-prs. to wall pieces and gingals, were mounted on the parapets.\r\nThe infantry were armed with flint-lock muskets, many of them old\r\nweapons, worn out and sold as scrap iron by the British military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nWhen the ships containing the Bengal contingent reached the mouth\r\nof the Rangoon river on April 2, 1852, Major-General H. Godwin, who\r\nwas in command of the troops, sent a vessel under a flag of truce to\r\ninquire whether any answer had been received from the King of Ava to\r\nthe letter containing the British demands for redress. The Burmese\r\nreplied by firing on the flag of truce, and Godwin, not feeling\r\nstrong enough to attack Rangoon until the Madras contingent had\r\njoined him, sailed for the capital of Tenasserim, Moulmein, at that\r\ntime threatened by the garrison of the neighbouring Burmese city of\r\nMartaban. On the morning of the 5th of April the fleet opened fire\r\nupon Martaban, and under cover of the bombardment the right wing of\r\nthe XVIIIth and part of the 80th landed; a storming party, led by\r\nthe grenadier companies of these two regiments, scaled the wall, and\r\nin a short time the place was in our hands. Thanks to the diary of\r\nthe late Colonel G. A. Elliot, then a subaltern in the Royal Irish,\r\ninteresting particulars have been preserved of this little fight, in\r\nwhich the younger men in the regiment were in action for the first\r\ntime. Under a heavy but badly directed fire the grenadiers dashed\r\nacross the twenty yards of ground between the water’s edge and the\r\nmain defence of the city, a thick wall fifteen feet high and about\r\neight hundred yards in length. Here the enemy’s bullets began to take\r\neffect among the Royal Irish. Colonel Elliot writes that--\r\n\r\n  “Private Fergusson received three in his left arm, and died of\r\n  his wounds,[150] John Donovan two in his left hand, Coleman one\r\n  through his left arm. We ran up and got close under the wall in\r\n  extended order; the General was seen to take off his hat and\r\n  give a cheer, which our men returned and then quickly sprung\r\n  up the wall, (which was overgrown with shrubs) and rushed upon\r\n  the Burmese, who quickly retired to some jungle, whence they\r\n  fired, though without much effect. While surmounting the wall\r\n  one of our officers noticed a man in the regiment get on to the\r\n  top and look intently into a large bush below him. Still gazing\r\n  intently, he loosed a brick, flung it down into the bush, raised\r\n  his musket and shot a Burmese who had been hiding there in\r\n  cover. We then advanced, and joining part of the 80th, and one\r\n  of our own companies, skirmished up one of the hills enclosed\r\n  by the wall, driving the Burmese before us, and charging them\r\n  whenever they appeared in numbers. The hill was very steep, and\r\n  obstacles existed in the shape of felled trees with branches\r\n  pointing downwards. At the top was a Pagoda, surrounded by a\r\n  wall mounted with gingals, but as there was no resistance, the\r\n  men rested here for an hour in the shade. We then moved down a\r\n  lane which led towards the next hill; after advancing about two\r\n  hundred yards we came to an open space where the bullets began to\r\n  fly over our heads from the hill in front. The men halted, and\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds, XVIIIth, who was acting Brigadier,\r\n  halted for reinforcements: ... but as soon as the Burmese saw\r\n  that we had stopped, they began shouting and challenging us to\r\n  come on, and after a while they poured down the hill towards us.\r\n  Colonel Reignolds now allowed the men to charge, and with a cheer\r\n  they dashed forward. The enemy ran back to a wall on the top of\r\n  the hill and began a badly aimed fire; Glesson, Grenadier Company\r\n  was struck in the mouth. The enemy evacuated the hill.”\r\n\r\nAfter clearing a third hill the detachment whose fortunes Elliot has\r\ndescribed joined the main body, and as the enemy were completely\r\nrouted all marched back to the beach. The casualties in this affair\r\nwere eight wounded, seven of whom were men of the Royal Irish; but\r\nmany soldiers were struck down by the sun, a warning, unhappily\r\ndisregarded, against the folly of wearing in the tropics the same\r\nuniform as that in use in the United Kingdom. In the despatch\r\ndescribing the capture of Martaban the following officers of the\r\nregiment were mentioned, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds;\r\nCaptain A. N. Campbell, on whom devolved the command of the wing\r\nwhen Reignolds was ordered to act as Brigadier; and Captain A.\r\nGillespie, grenadier company, who was the first man over the enemy’s\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nGodwin had now secured the safety of Moulmein; and leaving a small\r\ngarrison in Martaban, he returned with the greater part of his force\r\nto the Rangoon river, where the Madras contingent and reinforcements\r\nfrom Bengal awaited him. Among the latter was the left wing of the\r\nRoyal Irish, who since its arrival had been employed with the Navy\r\nin destroying the stockades at the mouth of the river. On the 10th\r\nof April the fleet began to move up-stream, and next morning the\r\nsteamers were in their appointed positions, ready to bombard the\r\nworks which defended the landing-places giving access to Rangoon.\r\nThe Burmese opened fire; the sailors replied with energy, and the\r\ncannonade continued till late in the day, when landing parties, among\r\nwhom were detachments of the XVIIIth, stormed the stockades; and\r\ndriving away the enemy, cleared the way for the disembarkation of the\r\nmain body. Though General Godwin had served in the first expedition\r\nto Burma, his recollections of the topography of Rangoon would\r\nhave been misleading had they not been supplemented by information\r\nsupplied by a British trader, from whom he learned that since the\r\nwar of 1824-26 part of the town had been abandoned and lay in\r\nruins; a new quarter had sprung up, and the fortifications had been\r\nremodelled to meet the fresh conditions. Rangoon was now built in a\r\nrough square, with sides about three-quarters of a mile in length,\r\nsurrounded by deep ditches, and walls sixteen feet high and eight\r\nfeet thick. In the works was included the Shwe Dagon, turned into\r\na citadel by the mounting of cannon upon the three tiers of huge\r\nterraces which support the foundations of this great pagoda. From\r\nthe landing-places on the river to the gate in the southern wall is\r\nabout a mile and a quarter; and the Burmese, remembering that in the\r\nfirst war we had marched by that road, concluded that the tactics of\r\n1826 would be repeated in 1852, and concentrated the greater part of\r\ntheir artillery and about ten thousand troops on the southern section\r\nof the defences. Godwin, however, completely upset this scheme of\r\ndefence by declining to attack where he was so obviously expected.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 12th of April the right column--composed of the XVIIIth,\r\n51st, the 40th Bengal Native Infantry, two guns of the Madras\r\nArtillery, and a detachment of the Madras Sappers and Miners--landed,\r\nwith a day’s cooked rations and sixty rounds of ammunition on their\r\npersons; by 7 A.M. they were advancing on an outwork, known as the\r\n“White House stockade,” which obstructed their path through the\r\njungle. The field-guns, escorted by the grenadier and Light companies\r\nof the XVIIIth, shelled it till the 51st were ordered to the assault;\r\nthe other companies of the regiment were following in support, when\r\nthey were suddenly ordered to halt, and to crowd into the jungle to\r\nclear the track for the Madras Sappers and the parties of bluejackets\r\nand European soldiers who carried the scaling ladders, then urgently\r\nrequired at the front. Some of the Royal Irish had been detailed for\r\nthis duty, which proved a dangerous one, as out of the four men of\r\nthe regiment told off to the first ladder three were wounded. This\r\ndelay threw the Royal Irish “out of the hunt,” and by the time they\r\nreached the stockade the 51st had stormed and occupied it. At this\r\npoint General Godwin was forced to call a halt: five of the senior\r\nofficers had been struck down by solar apoplexy, two of them fatally;\r\nmany of the men lay on the ground senseless from sunstroke; all\r\nranks were worn out by the overpowering heat, and he was forced to\r\nbivouac on the ground he had gained. From papers left by Colonel,\r\nthen Lieutenant, C. Woodwright, XVIIIth, it appears that during the\r\nafternoon, while the Royal Irish were slaking their thirst at wells\r\ndiscovered in the jungle, a number of Burmese stalked the covering\r\nparties, surprised them by a heavy fire, and occupied a pagoda, from\r\nwhich they directed an annoying fusilade on the watering-place. While\r\nother portions of the regiment drove back the enemy’s skirmishers,\r\nWoodwright’s company was ordered to seize the pagoda: this was\r\naccomplished successfully, though with the loss of Colour-Sergeant\r\nKelly and several men seriously wounded. Twice in the night the\r\nBurmese attempted to rush the bivouac of the Royal Irish, but were\r\ndriven back by a few rounds of canister from light field-guns.\r\n\r\nFor more than forty hours General Godwin was unable to advance.\r\nHis commissariat officers were very slow in issuing rations to\r\nreplace the one-day’s supply carried by the troops; the gunners were\r\nequally slow in landing and transporting to the front the four 8-in.\r\nhowitzers, on which he relied to make a breach in the defences of\r\nRangoon; and it was not until 5 A.M. on the 14th that the column was\r\nagain in motion. The XVIIIth and the 40th Bengal Native Infantry led,\r\nfollowed by the 51st and the 35th Madras Native Infantry; the 80th\r\nwere in charge of the guns, and a Madras Native Infantry regiment\r\nkept up communication with the ships in the river. Working slowly\r\nthrough jungle so thick that paths had to be cut for the passage\r\nof the guns, Godwin avoided the enemy’s main stockades; but as his\r\nleading troops came within sight of the great pagoda, the guns on\r\nits terraces opened fire. Opposite the gate in the eastern wall,\r\nby which he proposed to force his way into Rangoon, the ground was\r\nso difficult that there was barely room for the XVIIIth and the\r\n80th to form up in quarter columns, while they halted till the\r\nguns had made a practicable breach. The Burmese artillery played\r\nupon the easy target offered to them, and their skirmishers became\r\nso bold that five hundred muskets were required to keep them at\r\na respectful distance from the main body of the infantry. The\r\nsituation was becoming impossible when it was discovered that the\r\ngate had been opened, presumably to afford a safe retreat to the\r\nBurmese soldiers who were harassing our flanks. Godwin determined\r\nto assault forthwith, and placed Lieutenant-Colonel Coote in command\r\nof a storming party, composed of two companies of the Royal Irish,\r\nthe wing of the 80th, and part of the 40th B.N.I. Under a galling\r\nfire, the column moved with great steadiness across a shallow valley,\r\nhalf a mile in width, and swept like a tidal wave over terrace after\r\nterrace until the Shwe Dagon was won. Then the Burmese broke and\r\nfled in panic, losing heavily in their retreat, especially at a\r\npoint where part of the grenadier company of the Royal Irish fell\r\nupon them in flank with the bayonet, and in a short time Rangoon\r\nwas in our hands. In the British land forces the casualties between\r\nthe 11th and the 14th of April were a hundred and forty-five--two\r\nofficers were killed and fourteen wounded; fifteen of the other\r\nranks were killed, and a hundred and fourteen wounded. Nearly a\r\nthird of these losses fell upon the Royal Irish: Lieutenant and\r\nAdjutant R. Doran, pierced by four bullets, fell mortally wounded at\r\nthe foot of the pagoda;[151] Lieutenant-Colonel Coote, Captain W.\r\nT. Bruce, and Lieutenant G. A. Elliot were wounded; a sergeant and\r\ntwo privates were killed, a sergeant, a drummer, and thirty-seven\r\nprivates wounded.[152] In his despatch General Godwin mentions four\r\nofficers of the Royal Irish--Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds, who was in\r\ntemporary command of a brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel Coote, Captain G.\r\nF. S. Call (Brigade Major), and Captain J. J. Wood, who brought the\r\nregiment out of action.\r\n\r\nFor the next few months the XVIIIth lay sweltering at Rangoon, where\r\nGeneral Godwin was obliged to await the arrival of reinforcements\r\nbefore undertaking further operations on a large scale. During this\r\nperiod of enforced inaction life was by no means agreeable: the heat\r\nwas intense, the labour of hut-building severe, the duties heavy,\r\nand there was much sickness among the troops. Two small expeditions\r\npushed out north and west--the first occupied the town of Pegu; the\r\nsecond captured the city of Bassein, important as commanding one of\r\nthe three navigable mouths of the Irrawaddy. In neither of these\r\nenterprises did the Royal Irish play any part. Their only “outing”\r\nat this time seems to have been a two-days’ hunt after a Burmese\r\nofficial whom the General was anxious to take prisoner. After hard\r\nmarching they had their quarry almost within their grasp, when he\r\ndisappeared into the jungle, leaving in their hands a string of carts\r\nladen with his numerous wives. In August it became known that the\r\nKing of Ava, by no means disheartened by the loss of Rangoon and\r\nthe other towns we had wrested from him, was gathering large forces\r\nnear Prome, two hundred miles up the Irrawaddy. After a flotilla of\r\ngunboats had destroyed the stockades on the banks of the river near\r\nthat town, Godwin determined to occupy it, to serve as an advanced\r\nbase in the movement upon Ava, which he awaited the permission of\r\nGovernment to begin. When the long-expected reinforcements began to\r\narrive, the Royal Irish found themselves in a division commanded\r\nby Sir John Cheape. The first brigade was under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nReignolds, and consisted of the XVIIIth, and the 40th and 67th Native\r\nInfantry regiments. Two officers of the Royal Irish were on the\r\nstaff: Captain G. F. S. Call was Brigade Major to Reignolds’ brigade,\r\nCaptain W. T. Bruce was Assistant Adjutant-General to the first\r\ndivision. This organisation, however, appears to have been merely one\r\non paper, for in September Godwin announced to the troops that he was\r\nabout to resume active operations, and warned the XVIIIth, the 80th,\r\nand the 35th Madras Native Infantry to hold themselves in readiness\r\nto embark under command of Brigadier-General Reignolds. These\r\nregiments, with some Artillery and Sappers and Miners, disembarked\r\nwith slight opposition at Prome on the 9th of October, and on\r\nmarching a short way inland found that the Burmese had disappeared.\r\nIn the landing there were a few casualties, none of them among the\r\nRoyal Irish; but that night the young soldiers of the regiment had\r\na stern lesson in outpost duty--one of their comrades, who allowed\r\nhimself to be surprised on sentry, was killed, and his head sent as a\r\ntrophy to the King of Ava. While troops were being gradually passed\r\nup the river to Prome, the Burmese attacked our garrison in Pegu, and\r\na considerable force had to be sent to the rescue, but the XVIIIth\r\nwas not employed either in the relief of Pegu, or in the operations\r\nof a column sent to clear the jungles round Martaban.\r\n\r\nFor many months it continued to form part of the garrison of\r\nProme, which was invested by the Burmese, who surrounded the place\r\nwith stockades, thrown up in the jungle, a mile or two beyond our\r\noutposts. In November three companies helped to destroy one of these\r\nworks, whose defenders had been active in intercepting supplies\r\nbrought in by friendly natives. Later in the month two companies\r\nunder Brevet-Major Edwards were sent on a much longer expedition;\r\nthey formed the British contingent in a small column sent to rid\r\nthe districts of Khangheim and Padaung of the enemy. Crossing to\r\nthe right bank they worked up-stream, and at first met with little\r\nopposition, though they were “sniped at” by night. “On one occasion\r\nthe watering-place was surrounded by a small party, and several\r\nsepoys who had gone there to fill their drinking-vessels were killed\r\nor wounded. The column passed the spot where a few days before\r\nthe Captain of a native regiment with a small body of his men was\r\nsurprised by the Burmese, and the place where they were beheaded was\r\nstill plainly discernible by the blood-stains on the stones. The\r\nheads of the Captain and two men had been sent to Ava; their bodies\r\nwere left on the banks of the river till buried by the English.”[153]\r\nThe senior officer of the column broke down in health; Edwards\r\nsucceeded to the command; and from the Digest of Service it appears\r\nthat after several successful skirmishes he drove the Burmese into a\r\nplace called Tomah, where he hemmed them in until March, 1853, when\r\nreinforcements of all arms enabled him to storm their stockade, and\r\ncapture their guns, stores, and bullock-carts. During a lull in these\r\noperations Major Edwards was sent on a difficult, but interesting\r\npiece of work--to lead a small column to the top of the Tonghoo\r\npass over the Yo-Ma range of mountains between Burma and Aracan,\r\nand there take charge of a hundred and forty-eight elephants, sent\r\nfrom India by the Governor-General to reinforce the transport of\r\nthe army. Edwards’ command was composed of a hundred of the XVIIIth\r\nunder Major Borrow, the same number of the 80th, two hundred Sikhs,\r\nand a few Madras Sappers and Miners, with three thousand coolies to\r\ncarry the supplies and drive the slaughter cattle. All went well\r\ntill the column began to ascend the foothills of the main range,\r\nwhen the coolies, frightened at the steep, jungle-covered slopes,\r\nflung down their loads and deserted in a body. As the European troops\r\ncould carry but a portion of the stores, they soon ran out of tea,\r\nbiscuit, and spirits, and had to fall back upon beef-on-the-hoof,\r\nand for many days had nothing to eat but meat; to the Sikhs, whose\r\nreligion debared them from animal food, a small quantity of grain\r\nwas supplied. A day or two after this breakdown of the transport the\r\nguides confessed that they had lost their way, so Edwards decided\r\nto work upwards, along the course of the streams that furrowed the\r\nmountain-side. Slowly but sturdily the troops breasted the hills;\r\nby day they hacked paths through the jungle; by night they slept in\r\nclothing soaked in many fords and torrents. Yet such was the stamina\r\nof the Europeans that during the expedition not one fell ill, and\r\nthey outmarched the Sikhs, who broke down and had to be left behind.\r\nAfter nineteen days of this tremendous strain Edwards reached the\r\nrendezvous; the elephants had not yet come up, but a large supply of\r\nrice had already arrived, and his troops, eager for vegetable food,\r\npounced on it with delight. In a few days the elephants lumbered up\r\nthe pass, loaded with commissariat stores of every kind, on which the\r\nmen feasted, while the animals rested after their climb. Then the\r\nlong column of men and beasts crashed downwards through the forest\r\nand reached Padaung, on the Irrawaddy, in less than a quarter of the\r\ntime occupied in the upward march. Official thanks were given to all\r\nranks when the convoy of elephants was handed over to the transport\r\ndepartment, and a month’s extra batta was granted to those who had\r\ntaken part in the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe account of the doings of the XVIIIth at the front must now be\r\nbroken by Lord Wolseley’s description of his first meeting with the\r\nregiment of which he is now the honoured Colonel-in-Chief. As a\r\ncallow subaltern in the 80th, quite new to the practical side of war,\r\nhe found himself at Rangoon in charge of a piquet, composed in part\r\nof very young soldiers of the XVIIIth, who had been left at the base\r\nunder command of Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Grattan. These youngsters\r\nwere not yet disciplined; they had been greatly amused at the young\r\nofficer’s attempts to march his detachment to its post, and three of\r\nthem, carried away by their high spirits, took liberties and refused\r\nto number off in the way he ordered. Wolseley promptly made prisoners\r\nof the culprits, and next morning\r\n\r\n  “had to appear at the Orderly Room of the Royal Irish detachment.\r\n  It was a little room in a small teak-built hut, and there Colonel\r\n  Grattan, C.B., of that historic regiment, daily dispensed justice\r\n  to his young recruits. He was an old and amusing Irishman, full\r\n  of quaint stories, and a very pleasant companion. Taken prisoner\r\n  in the China War, he had been carried about in a cage as a\r\n  show for the amusement of millions who had never before seen a\r\n  European. His smiling face and grotesque grimaces always obtained\r\n  for him a favourable reception. He greeted me pleasantly when\r\n  I entered the orderly room, where--I may explain for Civilian\r\n  readers--the Commanding Officer of every regiment and battalion\r\n  in the Army holds a daily court to administer justice all round.\r\n  Three prisoners from Tipperary were marched in bare-headed, and\r\n  were drawn up facing the Colonel, who sat, pen in hand, behind a\r\n  little table which separated them from him. A Corporal and a file\r\n  of the guard, with drawn bayonets, stood beside the culprits,\r\n  an acting Sergeant-Major, standing as all the others were, at\r\n  ‘Attention’, made up the stage. A solemn silence that somewhat\r\n  awed me pervaded the scene, and my shyness became greater when\r\n  the funny-looking colonel addressing me, asked me sternly what\r\n  complaint I had to make against the prisoners. I told my story as\r\n  best I could, being extremely impressed by what I believed to be\r\n  the gravity of the offence. My military reading and study of the\r\n  Mutiny Act and Articles of War had led me to believe that, next\r\n  to striking an officer or running away in battle, these prisoners\r\n  had committed the most heinous offence in absolutely refusing\r\n  to obey a lawful command when on outpost duty before the enemy.\r\n  I expected they would be at once sent to trial before a general\r\n  court martial, and either sentenced to death, or if their lives\r\n  were spared in consideration of their youth and entire ignorance\r\n  of a soldier’s duty, they would at least be transported.\r\n\r\n  “When I had finished my awful indictment, the Colonel with\r\n  his funny little grey eyes, frowned from under his long grey\r\n  eyebrows, first at me and then in sternness at the boy prisoners\r\n  before him. There was an awful pause; you could have heard a pin\r\n  drop if any one there had had such an evidence of civilization\r\n  ready for the occasion. I held my breath, not knowing what was\r\n  coming. I looked at the Sergeant-Major; his face was wooden and\r\n  devoid of all expression as he stolidly looked straight before\r\n  him into nothing. In a moment a volley of oaths from the Colonel\r\n  removed the atmospheric pressure. He called the prisoners ‘limbs\r\n  of Satan,’ and choking, partly at least I should say because his\r\n  vituperative vocabulary had come to an end, he jumped to his\r\n  feet, upsetting the table, with its ink bottle, papers, etc.,\r\n  and rushed upon the prisoners, kicking hard at the nearest, and\r\n  crying aloud: ‘Get out, ye blackguards; never let me see you\r\n  again.’ Whether it was that the prisoners were accustomed to this\r\n  mode of justice and, being frightened, were anxious to avoid the\r\n  toes of their Colonel’s boots as he lashed out at them or not,\r\n  they turned round and ran for their lives, the Sergeant-Major\r\n  after them, with their caps, which he had been holding--according\r\n  to regulation--whilst this strangely scenic trial was being\r\n  enacted.\r\n\r\n  “I was in dismay, and for a moment thought of running too, but\r\n  seeing the old Colonel burst out laughing, I tried to smile, but\r\n  it was an unhealthy attempt at hilarity on my part. However,\r\n  being assured the men would never forget the scene or misbehave\r\n  again, I went away feeling rather that I had been the culprit,\r\n  and had only escaped condign punishment through consideration\r\n  of my youth and complete ignorance of all military customs and\r\n  laws. I don’t know whether these three boys from Tipperary\r\n  retained a lasting remembrance--as I did--of the curious mode\r\n  of administering justice, but I am sure their Colonel’s conduct\r\n  was far more in consonance with their views of propriety, and\r\n  far better suited to the case, than any sentence of imprisonment\r\n  and trial by court martial would have been. I laugh now as I\r\n  think of the whole scene, and as I do so, I feel all the more how\r\n  necessary it is that Irish soldiers should have Irish officers\r\n  over them, who understand their curiously Eastern character, and\r\n  who are consequently better able to deal with them than strangers\r\n  can.”[154]\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of February, 1853, the headquarter companies at\r\nProme had a weary time. Sickness was rampant; in a letter written\r\nat the end of November, 1852, an officer of the XVIIIth mentions\r\nthat the regiment could only turn out 350 men fit to take the field.\r\nNinety men had been buried at Rangoon, where cholera broke out a few\r\nhours after the capture of the great Pagoda; for a month the Royal\r\nIrish had been dying at the rate of almost one a day; 137 were in\r\nhospital; large numbers had broken down and been invalided out of\r\nthe country. The other regiments were equally unhealthy, and out of\r\nthe whole garrison of Prome the General could only count on some\r\n900 effectives, whose numbers were daily reduced by the ravages\r\nof climate and by the strain of the guards and piquets, which,\r\nthough cut down as low as safety permitted, told severely upon the\r\ntroops who remained at duty. The only break in this harassing and\r\nmonotonous existence was afforded by occasional reconnaissances and\r\nnight attacks, in which the enemy showed themselves more anxious to\r\nmurder and decapitate individual men than to close with any formed\r\nbody of soldiers. Suddenly four companies of the Royal Irish were\r\nwarned for an expedition to clear the line of communication, which\r\nwas harassed by Myat Toon, a robber chieftain, who from his lair\r\nnear Donobyu attacked the native boats in our employ on their way\r\nup the Irrawaddy with provisions for the front. The village of\r\nDonobyu was about fifty miles above Rangoon; it was connected with\r\nthe Irrawaddy by a network of creeks, and surrounded by dense jungle,\r\nalmost impassable from deep nullahs full of water, which cut up the\r\nground in every direction. In this jungle Myat Toon had fortified\r\nmany positions, formidable in themselves, and most difficult of\r\naccess to Europeans. The sailors had made several spirited attempts\r\nto penetrate into this labyrinth, but their boats were unable to pass\r\nthe barricades of logs and forest trees with which the waterways had\r\nbeen obstructed; and a combined force of bluejackets and soldiers,\r\nacting on land under a post-captain in the navy, was surprised and\r\ndefeated with the loss of two guns. The army was now to take in\r\nhand the punishment of the seven or eight thousand guerillas who\r\nfollowed the fortunes of Myat Toon, and General Godwin selected\r\nSir John Cheape to lead the avenging force, composed of a small\r\nbody of Irregular Native cavalry, detachments of Madras Sappers and\r\nMadras and Bengal Artillery with one 24-pr. howitzer and a 9-pr.\r\nfield-gun, two hundred of the XVIIIth under Captain A. W. F. S.\r\nArmstrong,[155] two hundred of the 51st, two hundred Sikhs, and the\r\n67th Bengal Native Infantry regiment. Major F. Wigston, XVIIIth,\r\nwas in charge of the right wing of the column, with Lieutenant F.\r\nEteson, XVIIIth, as his staff-officer. Descending the river to\r\nwithin thirty-five miles of Donobyu, Cheape disembarked at Henzada,\r\na village where a number of country bullock-carts awaited him. As\r\nhe was led to believe that three or four days’ march would bring\r\nhim to Myat Toon’s stockades, he decided to fill up his transport\r\nwith seven or eight days’ rations, dash on his enemy, defeat him,\r\nand then hasten back to the steamers. Leaving behind him the sick,\r\nwho, though it was barely a week since he left Prome, were already\r\nnumerous, he plunged into an unknown country, where his guides proved\r\nuseless, his information defective and misleading. He could not\r\nfind the main body of Myat Toon’s men, though skirmishing dacoits\r\nhung on his flanks, and in four days he was obliged to fall back\r\nto the river for supplies. He now transferred his base to Donobyu,\r\nwhich was known to have been evacuated by the enemy, and sending his\r\nempty carts there by land under escort of a party of the XVIIIth, he\r\nre-embarked with the remainder of his troops for Donobyu, where he\r\nremained till the 7th of March, when the native regiment joined him,\r\nand with it a draft of recruits for the 80th and a large supply of\r\ncommissariat stores. After providing for the safety of his base and\r\nof another batch of sick men, General Cheape started on his second\r\nhunt for Myat Toon, whose entrenchments he was again assured could be\r\nreached in three days. Now began a campaign, short in duration, but\r\nharassing beyond measure to the troops engaged in it. The soldiers\r\nhad to feel their way along narrow paths, often obstructed by trees\r\ncut down across the track by foes, who rarely showed themselves by\r\nday, though they disturbed the bivouac by sniping shots at night. To\r\nbridge the nullahs took much time and labour; the burden of guarding\r\nthe transport carts was heavy; the heat was steamy, exhausting,\r\nand depressing; fog hung over the face of the land until several\r\nhours after sunrise; the water was tainted, and cholera broke out\r\namong the men. Then rations began to run short, and the column was\r\nobliged to halt four days in this pestilential forest while a convoy\r\nbrought up fresh supplies from Donobyu. After forming an advance\r\nbase for his spare stores and the sick and wounded, Cheape once more\r\npushed forward, and on the 17th the right wing came upon traces of\r\nthe enemy, who had blocked the track with a series of abattis and\r\nrecently felled trees. The Royal Irish were leading, for Wigston,\r\nremembering that it was St Patrick’s Day and anxious to do honour to\r\nthe occasion, had detailed them as advance-guard to give them every\r\nchance of a fight, if the Burmese would so far oblige them. After\r\nthey had turned these obstacles, or cut their way through them,\r\nthey ran against a stockade held by Myat Toon’s followers, and with\r\na wild yell dashed at the work, which with the help of the Sikhs\r\nthey carried “most gallantly” at the point of the bayonet.[156] The\r\ndefenders did not wait for the cold steel, but after firing up to the\r\nlast moment bolted into the jungle. One man, however, lingered too\r\nlong over his parting shot, and was pursued by two subalterns, Hewitt\r\nand Eteson, who gave chase down the bed of a dry watercourse. Hewitt\r\nslipped and fell; Eteson succeeded in running his quarry down, and\r\nwas rewarded by obtaining from his prisoner much useful information\r\nabout the enemy’s main position. In this little affair Lieutenant\r\nWoodwright and five rank and file were wounded. Next day there was\r\nsharp skirmishing before the approach of darkness forced Cheape to\r\nhalt on a narrow path, leading towards the village reported to be\r\nthe headquarters of Myat Toon. Very soon after the piquets had been\r\nposted and the bivouac formed, the fog fell so heavily as to render\r\nreconnaissance very difficult, but when the outposts reported that\r\nthe enemy was busy felling trees and completing the defences of his\r\nposition, Lieutenant Eteson, three officers of the Sikhs, and three\r\nSepoys stole forward, ascertained where the enemy was at work, and\r\nthen returning to the General, described the place with sufficient\r\naccuracy to enable the gunners to fire rockets at it with some effect.\r\n\r\nAt the first glimmer of dawn on the 19th of March, our scouts began\r\nto grope their way down a wet nullah close to the bivouac, and\r\nfollowed it to its junction with a large creek, where the sound of\r\nvoices warned them that the Burmese were at hand. Creeping from tree\r\nto tree, the reconnoitrers reached the edge of the creek, and peering\r\nthrough the gloom dimly discerned Myat Toon’s works on the farther\r\nbank. The position was a strong one: the creek served as a moat to\r\na line of cleverly built breastworks, well loopholed, and protected\r\nby abattis; the left rested on an impassable swamp; the right ended\r\nin a dense thicket. As far as the scouts could see, the enemy’s\r\nfront was about a quarter of a mile long; but its prolongations into\r\nthe jungle really gave it a length of twelve hundred yards. Cheape\r\nwould gladly have turned the enemy’s right by a flank march; but to\r\ndo so he would have had to cut a road through thick jungle, and the\r\ncondition of the troops precluded his imposing so heavy a task upon\r\nthem, for though their spirit was high, their bodies were enfeebled\r\nby the effect of scanty food and bad water, while their numbers had\r\nbeen much reduced by the ravages of dysentery and cholera. There was\r\nnothing for it but a frontal attack; slowly and in silence he moved\r\ntowards the creek, and then under cover of the fog marched along its\r\nbank within a hundred yards of the Burmese stockades. For a time this\r\nprocessional movement was not discovered, for Myat Toon, convinced\r\nthat the British would not leave their bivouac till the sun had\r\ndispelled the fog, had taken no precautions against surprise; then\r\nsuddenly a rolling fire burst from the whole face of the works; to\r\nmeet it, the Sikhs were extended along our bank of the nullah, while\r\nthe remainder of the troops fell back into the jungle to form for\r\nbattle. Thus began an engagement as confused as the ground on which\r\nit was fought. At first a musketry duel raged across the creek; then\r\nscouting parties, or, as we should now call them, battle patrols,\r\nascertained that opposite the enemy’s right of the line of stockades\r\nthe creek ran dry, and was crossed by a track, which proved to have\r\nbeen prepared for defence: large forest trees had been felled across\r\nit; it was swept with grape from the two guns captured from the\r\nnavy, flanked by a detached work, and pitted with _trous-de-loup_.\r\nA storming party was hastily organised; and the detachment of the\r\n80th attempted to force its way across to the other side of the\r\ncreek, but being inadequately supported, failed in its object. Then\r\nthe Royal Irish and the Sikhs tried to push through the dense belt\r\nof jungle on the right of the Burmese line, but could not pass the\r\nabattis and detached breastworks hidden in its thickets. Finally,\r\nthe General decided that at all costs the track must be won and the\r\nstockades near it carried at the point of the bayonet. The troops, as\r\nmay well be imagined, were by this time greatly scattered, and while\r\nthe buglers were rallying the infantry, the Bengal artillerymen, with\r\nthe help of stragglers from the British detachments, dragged their\r\n24-pr. howitzer into action only twenty-five yards from the enemy,\r\nand covered the concentration of the foot soldiers by a destructive\r\nstorm of canister. In this episode Private ---- Connors, Royal Irish,\r\ngreatly distinguished himself. Early in the fight a Burmese bullet\r\nhad broken his left arm; he made his way to the doctor, had the\r\nbroken limb temporarily bound up, and then under heavy fire helped to\r\nrun the howitzer up to the front, tugging at the spokes of a wheel\r\nwith his right arm. At length a number of men from the XVIIIth, 51st,\r\nand 80th were collected, and, guided by Ensign Wolseley, charged\r\ndown the track yelling at their enemies, who manned the parapets and\r\nshouted defiantly, “Come on, Come on!” to them in Burmese. This is\r\nnot the place to describe how Wolseley led his mixed command, nor how\r\nhe was struck down, hard hit, at the moment of victory; his personal\r\nadventures in this charge, the second he led during the engagement,\r\nare narrated in the first volume of his Autobiography. It is enough\r\nto say that the troops advanced with determination, swept over the\r\nworks, and killed and wounded large numbers of the four thousand\r\nmen opposed to them. Those of the Royal Irish who took part in the\r\nfinal rush were well to the front: Lieutenant W. P. Cockburn fell\r\ndesperately wounded as he scaled a stockade; Lieutenant Eteson was\r\none of the first into the main work; and a party, led by Lieutenant\r\nWoodwright, recaptured the two naval guns, and marked the number of\r\nthe regiment upon them with a rusty nail.\r\n\r\nCheape’s success would have been complete if he had been able to\r\nsecure Myat Toon; but the Chief escaped with his life, though with\r\nlittle else, for he was compelled to abandon all his supplies\r\nand munitions of war. To follow him farther into the jungle was\r\nimpossible, for the health of the column was so bad that the General\r\nwas obliged to return to Donobyu, and thence to Prome where his\r\nsteamers anchored on April 2. The operations against Myat Toon had\r\nbeen costly; the losses in action were one hundred and thirty,\r\nwhile cholera alone caused more than a hundred deaths. Most of the\r\ncasualties occurred on the 19th of March, when eleven men were killed\r\nand eighty-four officers and men wounded. In the Royal Irish regiment\r\nLieutenant W. F. Cockburn died of his injuries; Major F. Wigston was\r\nseverely wounded; a corporal and eight men were killed; a sergeant\r\nand twenty-six men wounded; three colour-sergeants and eleven men\r\ndied of cholera;[157] and the health of the whole detachment was so\r\nmuch affected that on landing at Prome only twenty-two officers and\r\nmen remained fit for duty. Major F. Wigston, Captain A. W. F. S.\r\nArmstrong, and Captain W. T. Bruce were mentioned in despatches.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was not again in action during the Burmese war, as\r\nnegotiations for peace put a stop to all further operations in the\r\nfield. The province of Pegu was annexed to England, and as soon as\r\nthe new territory settled down, the XVIIIth was ordered to Calcutta,\r\narrived there at the end of November 1853, and a few weeks later\r\nembarked for home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 4.\r\n\r\n  SKETCH MAP\r\n  OF\r\n  EASTERN CHINA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 5.\r\n\r\n  SKETCH MAP\r\n  OF\r\n  NORTHERN BURMA\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nIn recognition of their services Majors F. Wigston and C. A.\r\nEdwards were awarded brevet-lieutenant-colonelcies, and Captains\r\nA. N. Campbell and W. T. Bruce brevet majorities. A medal and\r\nclasp was issued to all ranks, and the word “Pegu” was added to\r\nthe battle honours of the regiment. The losses of the Royal Irish\r\nin this campaign were enormous. When they returned to India their\r\nroll had been reduced by three hundred and sixty-five officers and\r\nmen, of whom but few had been killed in action or died of wounds;\r\nthe remainder had fallen victims to the diseases which rendered the\r\nswamps and jungles of Burma fatal to Europeans.[158] The names of the\r\nofficers who perished in Burma are recorded on the memorial at St\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1854-1856.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN THE CRIMEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Irish reached England in June, 1854, after a six\r\nmonths’ voyage from Calcutta, they were greeted by the news that\r\nfor the first time since Waterloo Britain had become embroiled in\r\na European war, and in alliance with France had sent troops to\r\nprotect Turkey against the Russians, who had invaded the part of\r\nthe Sultan’s dominions then known as the Danubian principalities.\r\nThe Czar had long cast covetous eyes on Turkey, whose European\r\nprovinces on the Ægean and the Sea of Marmora prevented the expansion\r\nof Russia towards the Mediterranean, and thus limited her seaboard\r\nto the Baltic and the Black Sea. In the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury Turkey appeared to be so decadent a country that its ruler\r\nwas commonly described as “the sick man”; the Czar actually threw\r\nout suggestions to England that she should divide with him “the sick\r\nman’s heritage,” and on her indignant refusal he determined to bide\r\nhis time and pick a quarrel with the Sultan on the first opportunity.\r\nA pretext soon presented itself in a dispute between the Greek and\r\nLatin branches of the Christian faith concerning their respective\r\nrights in the Holy Places of Jerusalem: the Czar hotly espoused\r\nthe cause of the Greek Church, while the Emperor Napoleon III.,\r\nreviving the historic claim of France to represent the Latin Church\r\nin Palestine, vigorously supported the views of the Roman Catholics.\r\nThe Sultan, profoundly indifferent to the rivalries of those whom\r\nhis religion taught him to regard as infidel dogs, attempted to\r\npropitiate both sides, but with such conspicuous ill-success that\r\nthe Czar declared war against him in October, 1853, and invaded the\r\nTurkish provinces on the Danube. To defend Turkey against this wanton\r\nand unprovoked attack, England and France in the spring of 1854\r\nlanded a considerable number of troops at Varna, a Bulgarian port on\r\nthe Black Sea. It was from no love of the Turks that England thus\r\nplunged into war with Russia: she took up arms in pursuance of the\r\nforeign policy which for centuries she has followed on the Continent,\r\nand sided with the weaker state--not on altruistic grounds but solely\r\nto preserve the balance of power in Europe, and to prevent the Czar\r\nfrom possessing himself of Constantinople, and thus obtaining direct\r\naccess to the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-French troops were still at Varna when, in the interests of\r\npeace, Austria brought such pressure upon the Czar that he recalled\r\nhis armies from Turkish soil. But though the immediate danger to\r\nConstantinople was averted by this intervention, the governments of\r\nEngland and France agreed that there would be no safety for Turkey,\r\nand therefore no tranquillity in European politics, until the Russian\r\nfleet in the Black Sea had been captured or destroyed, and its base\r\nat Sebastopol levelled to the ground. When the demolition of this\r\ngreat naval station was thus determined on, the allies knew little of\r\nSebastopol,[159] except that it was a fortress in the south of the\r\nCrimea, a peninsula jutting into the Black Sea from the mainland of\r\nRussia: and no soldier in western Europe had any conception of the\r\ndifficulties awaiting the Anglo-French Expedition when it put to sea\r\nfrom Varna on September 7, 1854. Exclusive of the crews of the great\r\nfleet of warships by which the transports were escorted, the fighting\r\nmen numbered about 63,000, of whom 28,000 were French, 7000 Turks,\r\nand 28,000 British. The French were under Marshal St Arnaud; Lord\r\nRaglan, who had served on Wellington’s staff in the Peninsular war,\r\ncommanded the British troops. Neither of these officers lived to see\r\nthe end of the campaign: St Arnaud died in September, 1854, and was\r\nsucceeded by General Canrobert who, after a few months, resigned his\r\npost to General Pélissier: Lord Raglan fell a victim to cholera at\r\nthe end of June, 1855, and was replaced by General Simpson. The Turks\r\nwere commanded by Omar Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe effort to collect and equip for war the comparatively small body\r\nof men forming the British quota of the combined forces had greatly\r\ntaxed the military resources of England. After the fall of the great\r\nNapoleon had restored peace to Europe, enormous reductions had been\r\nmade in our military expenditure;[160] not only was the _personnel_\r\nof the army cut down, but the _matériel_ was allowed to fall into\r\ndecay. For more than thirty years every arm and every department of\r\nthe service was systematically starved, with results well summed up\r\nby Lord Palmerston, who in 1846 bluntly informed his colleagues in\r\nthe Cabinet that our military weakness was such that England existed\r\n“only by sufferance and by the forbearance of other Powers.” This\r\nopinion was endorsed by the highest authority in the British army,\r\nfor Wellington himself acknowledged that our supply of guns, arms,\r\nammunition, and all kinds of stores was inadequate. Nor were these\r\ngrievous shortcomings atoned for by any high standard of efficiency\r\namongst the troops, for though the drill and discipline of the army\r\nwere alike excellent, neither the soldiers nor the departments vital\r\nto their existence in the field were trained in the slightest\r\ndegree for active service; indeed, until 1853, when a few thousand\r\nmen spent some weeks under canvas, no camp of exercise had been\r\nformed in England since the end of the Great War with France.\r\nMarksmanship was almost a lost art; and although the deadly volleys\r\nof the British infantry in the Peninsula had won for our troops the\r\nreputation of the best shots in Europe, musketry was so entirely\r\nneglected during the dead period after Waterloo, that the injunction\r\n“Fire low, and hit ’em in the legs, boys,” was the only instruction\r\ngiven to recruits. Even in the Foot Guards the men were considered\r\nto be masters of their weapon if, once in every three years, they\r\nfired thirty rounds of ball cartridge. The military education of the\r\nofficers was no better than that of the rank and file; there was no\r\nattempt to teach them anything beyond barrack-square drill; the vast\r\nmajority grew up ignorant of every detail of their profession, and\r\nas the Staff College at Camberley was not then in existence, the\r\nofficers selected for employment on the staff proved in the majority\r\nof cases to be blind leaders of the blind. The few veterans of the\r\nPeninsula who were still to be found among the Generals had seen war\r\non a grand scale; the officers who had served in eastern and colonial\r\ncampaigns had acquired much useful knowledge in these distant\r\noperations, but with these exceptions the Staff and regimental\r\nofficers were as untrained in the practice, as they were unversed in\r\nthe theory of war.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Irish reached England they were quartered at Chatham\r\nand Canterbury. At first there seemed no likelihood of their being\r\nactively employed, for when the regiment had left India many men\r\nhad volunteered into other corps, and the climate of Burma had\r\ntold so heavily on those who still remained with the Colours that\r\na large number of them were unfit for active service. Fortune,\r\nhowever, befriended the XVIIIth; in October the flank companies\r\nunder Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards were ordered to Windsor, to\r\nstrengthen the militia battalion which had replaced the regiment of\r\nFoot Guards at the Royal Castle. Her Majesty, Queen Victoria was much\r\nimpressed by the bronzed and soldierly appearance of the detachment,\r\nand learning from Colonel Edwards that the regiment was most anxious\r\nto serve in the war, she was pleased to direct that the XVIIIth\r\nshould proceed forthwith to the Crimea, where reinforcements were\r\nurgently required. As the result of the medical examination proved\r\nthat less than four hundred men were fit for the campaign, volunteers\r\nwere invited from other regiments: four hundred joined from the\r\n94th, a hundred and fifty from the 51st, and smaller contingents\r\nfrom other corps. On December 8, 1854, the regiment, eight hundred\r\nand forty-eight strong,[161] embarked at Portsmouth in the s.s.\r\n_Magdalene_, and reached the Crimea at the end of the year, about\r\nthree months and a half after the Allies had made good their footing\r\non Russian soil.\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to understand the condition of the British\r\nExpeditionary Force when the _Magdalene_ steamed into the harbour of\r\nBalaclava, it is necessary to give a very short account of the main\r\nevents of the war up to the end of 1854. Between the 14th and 18th\r\nof September the Allies[162] were engaged in landing at Kalamita\r\nBay, about thirty miles north of Sebastopol; two days after their\r\ndisembarkation was completed they forced the passage of the river\r\nAlma, defeating the Russians so completely that they were allowed\r\nto march southward without molestation, and to form bases on the\r\ncoast within a few miles of Sebastopol, the British establishing\r\nthemselves at Balaclava, a little port eight miles to the south, the\r\nFrench at Kamiesch Bay, six miles to the south-west of the fortress.\r\nThe Russian stronghold lies on the shores of a harbour, in shape not\r\nunlike a T: the top of the letter is represented by an arm of the sea\r\nrunning eastward from the Euxine for about four miles, and varying\r\nin width from a thousand to twelve hundred yards, while the leg is\r\nformed by a narrow creek which from the south runs into the main\r\ninlet, about two miles from the entrance to the open sea. On these\r\ndeep and sheltered waters the whole of the Russian fleet could ride\r\nin safety, protected by a ring of forts from attack by land or sea,\r\nand the labours of successive generations of engineers had converted\r\nthe western shore of the creek, or inner harbour, into a vast arsenal\r\nand dockyard, round which a thriving and populous city had sprung\r\nup. The Generals of the Anglo-French forces soon ascertained by\r\nreconnaissance that they had not nearly men enough to invest the\r\nwhole perimeter of the fortress, and at the same time to repel the\r\nattacks to be expected from the enemy’s field troops. All they could\r\nhope to accomplish was to pour upon one portion of the defences a\r\nfire so heavy as to become insupportable; and as the real power of\r\nthe defence was obviously concentrated in the arsenals, stores, and\r\nbarracks round the inner harbour, the Allies selected the southern\r\nworks, those protecting the heart of the fortress, as the object of\r\ntheir first attack, and took up positions on the plateau between\r\nBalaclava and Sebastopol. Bounded on the north by the harbour, on\r\nthe west and south by the sea, and on the east by the valley of the\r\nTchernaya, the surface of this plateau, or “Upland” as the British\r\ntermed it, was seamed by ravines which, beginning as mere depressions\r\nin the ground, grew deeper as they approached the fortress, finally\r\nbecoming precipitous gorges, difficult for troops to cross. Close\r\nto the harbour the ground between these gorges rose into gentle\r\nelevations, crowned by works which, as soon as the Russians realised\r\nthat the southern side of the fortress was threatened, were heavily\r\narmed and greatly strengthened. The largest of these ravines,\r\ndividing the plain from south to north, descended to the head of the\r\ninner harbour, and served as the boundary between the British on the\r\nright, and the French on the left of the besiegers’ line.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inability of the Allies to invest the fortress\r\ncompletely, communication continued uninterrupted between the\r\nnorthern part of Sebastopol and the interior of the Crimea; early\r\nin October the civilian population quitted the town, and thus\r\nrelieved the troops of the burden of feeding thousands of useless\r\nnon-combatants. The forethought of the Russians had collected in the\r\nmagazines of Sebastopol enormous supplies of guns, ammunition, and\r\nwarlike stores; the commissariat was well provided; the garrison\r\nconsisted of 38,000 men--soldiers, military workmen already partially\r\ntrained to arms, and sailors from the men-of-war which, at the\r\napproach of the Allies, had been sunk to block the mouth of the outer\r\nharbour. Among the regular troops was an officer in himself worth\r\nan army--Todleben, an engineer who had already made his mark in the\r\nfighting on the Danube. When it became known that the Allies were\r\nsailing for the Crimea he was sent to Sebastopol, where he became the\r\nmainspring of the defence. His courage and genius, his versatility\r\nand resource, his boundless energy, his power of inspiring enthusiasm\r\nand devotion among his men won for him the deepest respect of his\r\nenemies, and the fervent admiration of his fellow countrymen, who\r\nwith good reason claim for him a high place among great military\r\nengineers. He soon had an opportunity of displaying his talents.\r\nIn the middle of October the Allies opened fire upon the fortress,\r\nand at the close of the bombardment had reason to be satisfied with\r\nthe result, for the works were reduced to shapeless heaps, the\r\nbatteries ruined, the guns disabled. But next morning the assailants\r\ndiscovered that in Todleben they had to meet a master-mind: during\r\nthe night he had rebuilt the parapets, repaired the batteries, and\r\nreplaced the damaged guns from the almost boundless supply of cannon\r\nat his command. On the 25th, the Russian Field army, which after\r\nits defeat at the Alma had retired into the interior of the Crimea\r\nto await reinforcements, made an unsuccessful attempt to break the\r\nline of communication between the British camps on the Upland and\r\nBalaclava. A few days later the Allies determined to assault the\r\nfortress, but their project was discovered by the enemy. At dawn\r\non the 4th of November, the garrison and the field army together\r\nattacked the British right; and though after a desperate battle, to\r\nwhich the name of Inkerman has been given, the victory remained to\r\nthe Allies, it was dearly bought: the British casualties were 597\r\nkilled and 1760 wounded, while those of the French were 143 killed\r\nand 786 wounded. The Russians on their side lost more than 12,000\r\nmen, of whom a very large proportion were left dead upon the field.\r\n\r\nSo far our army had not fared badly in the campaign: the hardships\r\nhad not been greater than were to be expected on active service,\r\nand reinforcements had filled the gaps caused by casualties and\r\ndisease. Cholera, indeed, hung about the camp, and the men were\r\nundoubtedly overworked, for when the Anglo-French generals drew up\r\ntheir plans for the siege, the share in the operations which Lord\r\nRaglan undertook was greater than his troops could accomplish without\r\nundue fatigue. But despite sickness and overstrain the health of\r\nthe army was fairly good, and when, a few days after Inkerman, it\r\nwas officially announced that the Allies would spend the winter\r\nin the Crimea, men looked forward to the prospect without great\r\napprehension, for the weather was fine, and the Indian summer,\r\nbright, mild, and dry, gave no hint of the rigours of the coming\r\nwinter. Suddenly a terrific storm of rain and wind burst upon the\r\nCrimea, levelled whole camps and blew the tents, and all that the\r\ntents contained, far and wide over the Upland; the supplies of food\r\nand forage at the front were destroyed, and communication with\r\nBalaclava was temporarily cut off by the force of the hurricane.\r\nHad the fleet of store-ships then at anchor at Balaclava, or lying\r\noff the port, escaped destruction, the damage, in great measure at\r\nleast, could have been repaired; but twenty-one vessels were dashed\r\nto pieces, and eight more disabled. The ships that went to the\r\nbottom contained forage, ammunition, war-like stores of every kind,\r\ndrugs and surgical appliances, warm flannel shirts and drawers,\r\nwoollen stockings, boots and watch-coats--everything that the army\r\nmost urgently required. When fresh supplies arrived at Balaclava\r\nfrom England the means of conveying them to the Upland was utterly\r\ninadequate, for we had landed without a transport corps, depending\r\nfor land carriage on such horses and vehicles as could be seized in\r\nthe Crimea. The animals thus obtained died fast from want of forage,\r\nand in January, 1855, the Commissariat department could only muster\r\n333 horses and mules and 12 camels, while the divisional transport\r\nconsisted of a few ponies, dying from starvation and overwork. Though\r\nhorses in plenty were to be bought in the countries near the Crimea,\r\nand many transports were available to bring them to Balaclava, it\r\nwas useless to import animals until forage arrived to feed them, and\r\nforage unhappily was an article of which the Treasury had neglected\r\nto make an adequate provision. Consequently upon the troops fell the\r\nwhole labour of carrying on their shoulders from the port to the\r\ncamps everything that was required, not only for their own support,\r\nbut for the conduct of the siege. As was to be expected, the men\r\nbroke down terribly fast; in November there were nearly 17,000 on the\r\nsick list; in December there were more than 19,000 ineffectives, and\r\nin January, 1855, no less than 23,076 men filled the hospitals. The\r\nhorrors of this period of the war are well described by Field-Marshal\r\nSir Evelyn Wood, who served on shore as a midshipman in one of the\r\nNaval brigades.\r\n\r\n  “In the early part of the winter the battalions at the front\r\n  were generally on duty two nights out of three, and later,\r\n  every alternate night. The life of the rank and file was thus\r\n  spent:--The men were mustered carrying great-coat and blanket,\r\n  just before dusk, and marched through a sea of mud into the\r\n  trenches. These were cut up by deep holes from which boulders and\r\n  stones had been taken, and into these holes on dark nights, the\r\n  men often fell. When the soldier reached his position, he had to\r\n  sit with his back to the parapet, and his feet drawn up close\r\n  under his body to allow others to pass along the four-feet-wide\r\n  trench. If he was not detailed for a working party, nor for\r\n  piquet in the trenches or in advance of them, he might lie down,\r\n  resting as best he could, in a wet ditch. Assuming that the\r\n  soldier was not on piquet, and that there was no alarm--and these\r\n  were of frequent occurrence--he could, after the working parties\r\n  and their reliefs had ceased to move about the trenches, repose\r\n  till daylight, when he marched back to camp, and after a few\r\n  hours’ rest had to carry a load of some kind.\r\n\r\n  “The comparative repose enjoyed by those men who were required\r\n  only as a guard, or reserve in the trenches, was very different\r\n  to the condition of those who were employed from 200 to 300 yards\r\n  in advance of our works, often within conversational distance of\r\n  the opposing sentries. The reliefs for the sentries could snatch\r\n  a dog’s sleep for four hours out of six, hoping their comrades\r\n  would by remaining on the alert give them time to jump up ere\r\n  the enemy was on them; but for the two hours that each man was\r\n  out near the enemy, the strain on the nervous system would have\r\n  been great even to a robust, well-fed man. These sentries had\r\n  necessarily to stand absolutely still, silent and watchful, and\r\n  as the severity of the weather became more and more marked,\r\n  numbers of men whose frames were weakened by want of adequate\r\n  nutritious food, were found in the morning frost-bitten and\r\n  unable to move. One battalion which landed nearly 900 strong\r\n  early in November, was actually in the trenches six nights out of\r\n  seven, and then became so reduced, not only in numbers,[163] but\r\n  also in the men’s bodily strength, that it was unable for some\r\n  time to go there again.\r\n\r\n  “When the soldier got back to camp, he used to lie, often in\r\n  a puddle, which chilled his bones, under a worn-out tent,\r\n  through which the rain beat. The less robust would fall asleep,\r\n  completely worn out, to awake shivering, and in many cases to be\r\n  carried to a hospital tent scarcely more comfortable than the\r\n  tent which they had left, and thence to a grave in two or three\r\n  days. Those who were stronger, went out to collect roots of\r\n  brushwood, or of vines, and roasted the green coffee ration in\r\n  the lid of the canteen, afterwards pounding it in a fragment of\r\n  shell with a stone, ere they boiled it for use. Others, unequal\r\n  to this laborious process, would drink their rum, and eating a\r\n  piece of biscuit, lie down again in the great-coat and blanket\r\n  which they had brought, often wet through from the trenches.\r\n\r\n  “In the afternoon the soldier was sent on ‘fatigue’ duty from\r\n  five to seven miles, according to the position of his camp,\r\n  usually to Balaclava, to bring up rations. On his return he had\r\n  again to gather fuel in order to boil the salt beef or salt pork\r\n  in his mess tin, which did not hold water enough to abstract the\r\n  salt. A portion of the meat therefore only was consumed, and\r\n  it was necessary from time to time to tell off men to bury the\r\n  quantities thrown away. Salt pork which was issued two days out\r\n  of seven, was frequently eaten by the men in its raw state, from\r\n  the difficulties of finding fuel to cook it.\r\n\r\n  “Shortly before dusk the soldier either marched back to the\r\n  trenches, or lay down to sleep if he was not on piquet in front\r\n  of the camp. Many men disliking to report themselves sick, were\r\n  carried back from the trenches in the morning, and died a few\r\n  hours afterwards. Those who were reported sick were taken to\r\n  hospital, in many cases merely a bell tent; here the men lay,\r\n  often in mud on the ground, and in many instances their diet was\r\n  only salt meat and biscuit.[164] They were moreover so crowded\r\n  together that the doctors could scarcely pass between the\r\n  patients.\r\n\r\n  “The Regimental Medical officers unable to provide comforts,\r\n  medicine or proper housing, were eager to send down their\r\n  patients, even in storm and rain, to Balaclava, as the best\r\n  chance of saving their lives. As we had no ambulances, and the\r\n  French could not always lend us mule litter-transport, many were\r\n  necessarily carried on cavalry horses, which slipping upon the\r\n  hill outside Balaclava, often caused further injury or the death\r\n  of the patient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “The small schoolhouse at Balaclava, which we used as a hospital,\r\n  held only between 300-400 men, thus the great majority of the\r\n  sick and wounded were necessarily laid on the beach, exposed to\r\n  all weathers, while awaiting their turn for embarcation in the\r\n  transports. On the steamer running between Balaclava and the\r\n  Bosphorus--a voyage of 36 to 48 hours--the soldier seldom got\r\n  anything but tea and biscuit, sometimes only water. During this\r\n  short but terribly trying passage, from 8 to 9% succumbed and\r\n  were thrown overboard. Once on shore there was often a further\r\n  painful wait on the beach before they were carried up to the\r\n  hospital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “We who saw the ‘old soldier’ die without a murmur may well be\r\n  excused dilating on his virtues, when we endeavour to describe\r\n  what he suffered for our country, the ministry of which, having\r\n  given him a task far beyond his strength, failed to supply\r\n  him with clothes and food. It is impossible to overpraise the\r\n  disciplined silence of men under privations, which in a few weeks\r\n  reduced one battalion from nearly 1000 effectives to a strength\r\n  of 30 rank and file.”[165]\r\n\r\nThis misery was at its height when the Royal Irish disembarked at\r\nBalaclava on December 30, 1854; casualties, hardships, and disease\r\nhad so thinned the British ranks that in January, 1855, to meet all\r\nrequirements of the siege Lord Raglan had only 11,000 men at duty\r\non the Upland, many of whom were only fit to be in hospital: one\r\nday, indeed, after providing fatigues to bring up the necessaries of\r\nlife from Balaclava, he could only turn out two hundred and ninety\r\nofficers and men to guard his trenches--about one-twentieth part of\r\nthe garrisons of the forts opposite his works, against which at any\r\nmoment the Russians might have directed a sortie. The regiments upon\r\nwhich the war had told most heavily had almost ceased to exist: one\r\nbattalion paraded for duty with a few officers, a sergeant, and seven\r\nrank and file. With his army in such a condition, it was impossible\r\nfor Lord Raglan to continue responsible for the whole of the ground\r\nallotted to him at the beginning of the siege, and the French, who\r\nhad been very largely reinforced, and whose sufferings, though great,\r\nwere in comparison with ours but insignificant, relieved him on the\r\nextreme right of his line. The material result of this necessary\r\nbut deplorable admission of weakness was to “sandwich” the British\r\nbetween two wings of the French army, while morally it reduced us to\r\nthe position of a mere contingent in the forces of Napoleon III. By\r\nEngland’s persistent neglect of all things military she had sown the\r\nstorm, and her unhappy soldiers in the Crimea reaped the whirlwind;\r\nand it was not for many months, after thousands of lives had been\r\nwasted[166] and money spent like water, that her army was once more\r\nable to take its proper place in the forces of the alliance against\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were not at once sent up to the front, but for\r\nnearly a fortnight were employed on fatigues about the port. Thanks\r\nto this delay they were able to see their baggage and camp equipage\r\nsafe on shore, and thus, when ordered to the Upland, they began the\r\ncampaign well prepared to face the hardships that awaited them. In\r\nthis respect they were far better off than the regiments which first\r\nlanded in the Crimea. The original expedition had disembarked with\r\nhardly any vehicles; the men were so much enfeebled by the climate of\r\nVarna that they could not bear the weight of their knapsacks, which\r\nwith the rest of the baggage were left on board the transports; and\r\nwhen these vessels ultimately reached Balaclava, knapsacks, stores,\r\nand regimental property of every kind were lost in the confusion\r\nwhich for many months reigned supreme at our base of operations. The\r\nmiseries undergone by the troops who landed at the beginning of the\r\nwar have already been described; and the ragged, jaded starvelings\r\nwho dragged themselves from the camps on the Upland to the port of\r\nBalaclava on the daily quest for food were in pitiable contrast to\r\nthe well-fed, well-clothed, well-shod men of the XVIIIth. These\r\nmaterial advantages doubtless contributed largely towards the\r\ncomparative immunity from sickness enjoyed by the regiment during the\r\nsiege, but an even more important factor in its well-being was the\r\npresence in its ranks of a large number of soldiers who had been on\r\nactive service, and of many officers who had learned in two long wars\r\nnot only to take care of themselves, but also of the men under their\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1855, the Royal Irish received orders to join\r\nMajor-General Sir William Eyre’s brigade, then composed of the 4th,\r\n38th, and 50th regiments, which formed part of the third division\r\nunder Lieutenant-General Sir Richard England; and leaving a guard\r\nover such of their property as they could not carry with them, they\r\nstarted for the Upland. Their introduction to campaigning in the\r\nCrimea was a rude one; a blizzard raged as they floundered through\r\ndeep snow along a track, marked by the bodies of transport animals\r\nkilled by starvation and overwork; and when late in the afternoon\r\nthey reached Eyre’s camp, they were told off by companies to find\r\nshelter in the lines of other corps, for their own tents had been\r\nleft standing at Balaclava from want of transport to move them. When\r\nthe Royal Irish succeeded in bringing up their tents from Balaclava,\r\nthey settled down in camp with the handiness of seasoned troops.\r\nMost of the officers dug out the earth inside their tents to a depth\r\nof eighteen inches, piling the soil on the curtains to keep out the\r\nwind. There was no means of draining the inside of these habitations,\r\n“holes in the ground, roofed over with canvas,” as they were well\r\ndescribed, but as the camp of the third division was pitched on dry\r\nand porous ground the XVIIIth were not troubled with water inside\r\ntheir tents, nor outside had they the miseries of mud and standing\r\npools which made the camps on low ground so wretched. As for “warming\r\nthe tents,” continues Captain Kemp’s[167] statement,\r\n\r\n  “in mine we improvised a stove out of an old square biscuit-tin;\r\n  we let part of it into the earthen wall of the dug-out tent, and\r\n  made a chimney-pipe out of round meat tins, slipped one inside\r\n  the other. This chimney passing through the soil, came out clear\r\n  of the canvas and was then turned upwards for a couple of feet.\r\n  It answered well, though we were at times half smothered with the\r\n  smoke. Wood for fuel was very scarce. A small quantity was served\r\n  out for the soldiers’ cooking places, but the men had to carry\r\n  it into camp on their shoulders for a distance of two miles or\r\n  more. Their cooking was done in the usual trench in the open, but\r\n  in very severe weather--rain, wind or snow--it was impossible to\r\n  keep the fires going: this was one of the great hardships of the\r\n  campaign. The cooking for the officers was done close to their\r\n  tents, in holes or trenches dug by the servants, who used to\r\n  throw the earth round the kitchen, and cover it with any bits of\r\n  canvas they could find. Our servants had to forage for firewood,\r\n  and generally brought back nothing but the wet roots of vines\r\n  which they had grubbed up.”\r\n\r\nEach officer took out with him to the war a canteen containing\r\ncooking utensils, plates, dishes, and cups, but the wear and\r\ntear of camp life soon made havoc of this kit. At a farewell\r\ndinner given in March by the XVIIIth to Colonel Reignolds when,\r\ncompletely broken down by hardships, he made over the regiment to\r\nBrevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards and went home invalided, each of\r\nthe officers had to cook some part of the feast in his own kitchen,\r\nand brought the remnants of his plates, knives and forks, and the\r\narticles of food he had provided to the dinner, where empty jam pots\r\ntook the place of soup plates and champagne glasses.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Royal Irish joined Eyre’s brigade they began to do\r\nduty in the trenches, where parties were sent for twelve hours at a\r\ntime to guard the works, make good with sand-bags the damage done to\r\nthe parapets by the enemy’s projectiles, and improve the drainage.\r\nIn March, when the weather began to moderate, the tour of duty was\r\nincreased to twenty-four hours, much to the men’s satisfaction,\r\nas those who were not wanted by day for guards or working parties\r\nsnatched some hours’ sleep in the dry caves of the great ravine\r\nwhich, as has already been mentioned, marked the left of the\r\nBritish front. The duty, heavy for all, was particularly hard on\r\nthe officers, who were often in the trenches for seventy-two hours\r\nin the week. By day they had to direct the men at their labours, by\r\nnight to be prepared to meet an attack from the fortress. Thanks to\r\ntheir incessant care in seeing that the men were always ready for any\r\nemergency, and to half-hourly visits to the sentries, the officers\r\nof the XVIIIth were never surprised, and whenever the regiment was\r\nin the trenches the Russians received so unfriendly a welcome that\r\nthey never attempted to push home, though on several occasions they\r\ncrossed bayonets with the outlying sentries. These local attacks were\r\nnot the only dangers of night work during the siege. If the wind\r\nserved, and the Russians heard a party at work, they threw fireballs,\r\nwhich on striking the ground burst into a great flare; then, guided\r\nby the light, they poured grape upon the labourers, who used to throw\r\nthemselves for shelter behind the parapet of the trench until the\r\ncannonade ceased. Things began to brighten on the Upland in March:\r\na great burst of indignation at home against the archaic methods\r\nby which the army was administered had roused the officials of the\r\nWar Office and the Treasury to a tardy sense of their shortcomings:\r\na gang of navvies from England had almost finished a railway from\r\nBalaclava to the camps; a transport corps had been organised and was\r\ndoing good service,[168] and the troops, once more properly clothed,\r\ndiscarded the weird garments with which they had covered their\r\nnakedness during the winter months, and began to resume the bearing\r\nof British soldiers. So marked was the improvement in the appearance\r\nof the men that some martinets considered that only one thing was\r\nrequired to bring the army up to its old level--the resumption\r\nof the stock, which by general consent had been discarded at the\r\nbeginning of the war: but this relic of barbarism was not taken\r\ninto use for many months, and then only on the ceremonial parades\r\nat the end of the war. In justice to the XVIIIth it should be said\r\nthat throughout the siege all ranks managed to turn out respectably\r\nattired. The officers wore their red shell-jackets or blue frocks\r\nunder the regimental great-coat; and they were also provided with\r\na non-regulation garment, much like the “coat-warm-British” of the\r\npresent day, made of serge, lined with rabbit-skin, and reaching\r\nalmost to the knee. The great-coats of the men looked decent, and\r\nconcealed the blankets below them, converted into loosely fitting\r\nunder-coats by the simple expedient of cutting holes in them for the\r\nmen’s arms to come through. All ranks had fur caps, the envy of the\r\nwhole army. About this time the Minié rifles, with which the army\r\nwere then supposed to be armed, were issued to the Royal Irish, who\r\nhad been hurried off to the war equipped with Brown-Bess percussion\r\nmuskets, the same weapons that they had used in Burma.\r\n\r\nEven in the worst part of the winter the Allies never wholly\r\ndiscontinued their siege operations, and as the weather became\r\nless severe their parallels were pushed forward steadily towards\r\nSebastopol. The Russians on their side had not been idle: large\r\nreinforcements from the field army so abundantly made good the losses\r\nof the garrison that Todleben could command the services of 6000, and\r\neven on occasions of 10,000 men in carrying out his improvements\r\nof the defences. He seized and fortified fresh ground overlooking\r\nsome of the works of the Allies, and devised a successful method of\r\nharassing the men on duty in the trenches. Under cover of darkness\r\nhe dug numbers of shallow rifle-pits within musketry range of our\r\nlines, posting in each a marksman whose duty it was to shoot at every\r\nliving target he could see. These pits were gradually connected by\r\ncontinuous trenches, and became a source of much annoyance to the\r\nAnglo-French troops, who found them difficult to deal with: to turn\r\nthe sharpshooters out with the bayonet was costly, while to shell\r\nso small a mark as they presented was very difficult, and therefore\r\nlittle sandbag forts were run up at intervals on the parapets of the\r\ntrenches, manned by soldiers detailed to keep down the skirmishers’\r\nfire. In spite, however, of Todleben’s efforts the Allies succeeded\r\nin arming their batteries with an imposing number of heavy guns,\r\nand early in April finished their preparations for a vigorous\r\nbombardment, the prelude (as it was universally believed) to the\r\nstorming of Sebastopol. The French could bring to bear 378 pieces\r\nof ordnance; the British had only 123 guns and mortars available,\r\nbut as for the most part they were much more powerful than those of\r\nthe French, the difference in weight of metal was not great. The\r\ncannonade began on the 9th of April, and raged for ten days and\r\nnights, for though the guns did not fire after the sun was down, the\r\nmortars continued to play upon the fortress throughout the night.\r\nThough mitigated by Todleben’s genius for rapid repairs, the effect\r\nof the bombardment was very great, and all ranks were awaiting orders\r\nfor the attack when Canrobert, who on the death of St Arnaud had\r\nsucceeded to the command of the French, decreed that the assault was\r\nto be postponed.[169] The fire of the guns was gradually allowed to\r\ndie down: the digging parties resumed work upon the approaches: and\r\nthe Russians were allowed to carry out the restoration of their works\r\nwithout interruption other than that of occasional shots from our\r\nbatteries. This bombardment cost the enemy 6000 men: in the ranks\r\nof the Allies the casualties were far smaller, amounting among the\r\nFrench to 1585, among the British to 265 of all ranks.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of June the record of the XVIIIth is one of\r\nexceedingly hard work, unbroken by the excitement of any important\r\nengagement. The Royal Irish were employed in many different ways.\r\nThey toiled along the track, first from Balaclava, and then from\r\nrailhead to the camps on the Upland, laden, to use the soldiers’\r\nexpression, “like commissariat mules,” with stores; they were on\r\nfatigues of every kind, from digging parallels and throwing up\r\nbatteries to making gabions and fascines; and they took their turn\r\nin the trenches, where, though they demanded and often obtained the\r\ndangerous privilege of guarding the approaches nearest to the enemy,\r\ntheir losses were small. Between the 6th of February, when their\r\nfirst casualty occurred, and the 17th of June, only six men were\r\nkilled and thirty-six wounded. Of these injuries, however, many were\r\nof the gravest nature: on one occasion a shell from a Russian mortar\r\nburst among a detachment on its way to the trenches and struck down\r\nten of the party. To save the lives of the wounded the surgeons had\r\nto perform amputations upon each of them, and seven men lost a leg\r\napiece, two an arm each, while the least hurt escaped with the loss\r\nof a hand. This comparative immunity from casualties, however, was\r\nnot to last, for the regiment was now to be called upon to undergo\r\nan ordeal nearly as severe as those in its campaigns under William\r\nIII. and Marlborough. At the beginning of June the immediate object\r\nof the Allies was the capture of three outlying fortifications,\r\noutposts which covered the left of the line of Russian defences. The\r\ntrenches of the French right attack were faced by the White Works\r\nand a hill called “the Mamelon,” the latter of which barred the way\r\nto the Malakoff redoubt, one of the keys of the main position; the\r\nBritish sap led to “the Quarries,” where a number of works covered\r\nthe Redan, a fort as formidable and as important as the Malakoff\r\nitself. On the 6th of June another great bombardment began; five\r\nhundred and forty-four pieces of heavy ordnance hurled shot and shell\r\ninto the Russian works, and though answered by almost an equal number\r\ninflicted great injury: many cannon were dismounted and earth-works\r\nruined before darkness imposed silence upon our guns, though not upon\r\nour howitzers, which continued to fire throughout the night. Thanks\r\nto the boundless energy of Todleben and the dogged industry of his\r\nmen, much of the damage was made good before dawn; the cannon were\r\nremounted and the parapets rebuilt; but early in the morning the\r\nEnglish and French re-opened fire with such terrible effect that in\r\ntwo hours the _morale_ of the defenders was seriously affected. Then\r\nthe infantry of the Allies was let loose, and after heavy fighting\r\nsucceeded in taking the points assailed. In these achievements the\r\nXVIIIth had no part, as the third division was not employed in the\r\ncapture of the Quarries.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these three outlying works had been taken, the Allies\r\nbegan to prepare for an attack on the Malakoff and the Redan, and on\r\nthe 17th of June the batteries concentrated a furious fire on the\r\nRussian fortifications, with results so destructive to the enemy’s\r\nartillery that everything appeared to promise success for the assault\r\non the morrow. Lord Raglan and Marshal Pélissier, who had recently\r\nbeen placed in command of the French army, had already agreed upon\r\ntheir plans; remembering how rapidly during the night of the 6th-7th\r\nof June the Russians had re-fitted their batteries, the Generals\r\ndecided that the cannonade should be resumed at daylight for two\r\nhours, when it was calculated that the enemy’s guns would be silenced\r\nand the repairs of the night destroyed. The infantry was then to come\r\ninto action, the French against the Malakoff, the British against\r\nthe Redan. Barnard’s brigade of the third division was to support\r\nthe storming columns, while on the extreme left Eyre, with the other\r\nbrigade of the same division, was to threaten the fortifications\r\non the Russian right of the Redan and in front of the Dockyard\r\nCreek, and to convert his demonstration into a serious attack if\r\nthe assault on the Redan proved successful. Raglan’s preparations\r\nfor the execution of his part of this scheme were completed, when\r\nsuddenly, late on the night of the 17th, Pélissier informed the\r\nBritish Commander-in-Chief that he had resolved to dispense with\r\nthe preliminary bombardment, and to storm the Malakoff at daybreak.\r\nAgainst his own judgment, and in an evil hour for the Allied armies,\r\nRaglan consented to this all-important change of plan; the infantry\r\nattacks on the Malakoff and the Redan were delivered without adequate\r\nartillery preparation; Todleben, who had done wonders during the\r\nnight, was ready at every point, and the combined assault was beaten\r\nback with heavy loss. The only troops on whom Fortune smiled this day\r\nwere those of Eyre’s brigade, who fought magnificently, and worthily\r\nsustained the honour of the British army. The brigade was at this\r\ntime composed of the 9th, XVIIIth, 28th, 38th, and 44th regiments,\r\nbut so heavily had the campaign told upon them that, when in the\r\nsmall hours of the 18th of June Eyre mustered these five battalions,\r\nthere were but two thousand men in their depleted ranks. Covered by\r\nan advance-guard of a hundred and fifty sharpshooters--volunteers\r\nfrom each company in his command--the General left his camp while\r\nit was still black night, and marched down the great ravine towards\r\nthe Dockyard Creek. At daybreak, just as the troops detailed for\r\nthe assault on the Redan were swarming out of the trenches in which\r\nthey had been assembled, Eyre’s advance-guard reached a cemetery,\r\nsurprised the occupants of the rifle pits by which it was defended,\r\nand captured it without much trouble. This cemetery marked one flank\r\nof the enemy’s line, the other rested on a mamelon;[170] and to quote\r\nthe words of Eyre’s report, the intervening ground “was intersected,\r\nand the road barricaded with stone walls, which our men were obliged\r\nto pull down under fire before they could advance. In rear of this\r\nposition, towards the fortress, the enemy occupied several houses,\r\nthere were bodies of the enemy seen in rear, but in what strength\r\nI could not say. This position, under cover of the walls of the\r\nfortress, was strong.” Well might General Eyre describe the position\r\nas “strong.” The suburb, of which these houses formed part, consisted\r\nof villas standing in gardens, planted with peach-trees in full\r\nblossom, and surrounded with low stone walls, thickly overgrown with\r\nvines. From several points it was commanded by the Russian artillery;\r\nto our “half-left” was the Garden Wall battery; in front rose the\r\nCreek battery, built at the head of the inner harbour of Sebastopol;\r\non our right was the Barrack battery, and hidden behind the Redan\r\nwere field-guns, which after the assault on that work had failed\r\nturned their fire upon Eyre’s regiments.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the doings of the XVIIIth in detail it will be well\r\nto give a short account of the work done by the brigade as a whole.\r\nSuch an account is to be found in the letter to ‘The Times’[171] by\r\nSir William Russell, the celebrated war correspondent, who, writing\r\nonly two days after the battle, seems to have obtained his facts from\r\nthe reports supplied to Eyre by the officers commanding his units.\r\nAs Russell’s letter is in substantial agreement with Eyre’s report\r\nto his divisional general, its evidence appears valuable. After\r\nmentioning that the advance-guard occupied the cemetery with small\r\nloss, he says--\r\n\r\n  “the moment the enemy retreated, their batteries opened a heavy\r\n  fire on the place from the left of the Redan and from the Barrack\r\n  battery. Four companies of the XVIIIth at once rushed on out of\r\n  the cemetery towards the town, and actually succeeded in getting\r\n  possession of the suburb. Captain Hayman was gallantly leading on\r\n  his company when he was shot through the knee. Captain Esmonde\r\n  followed, and the men, once established, prepared to defend the\r\n  houses they occupied.[172] As they drove the Russians out, they\r\n  were pelted with large stones by the latter on their way up to\r\n  the battery, which quite overhangs the suburb. The Russians could\r\n  not depress their guns sufficiently to fire down on our men, but\r\n  they directed a severe flanking fire on them from an angle of the\r\n  Redan works. There was nothing for it but to keep up a vigorous\r\n  fire from the houses, and to delude the enemy into the belief\r\n  that the occupiers were more numerous than they were. Meanwhile\r\n  the Russians did their best to blow down the houses with shot\r\n  and shell, and fired grape incessantly, but the soldiers kept\r\n  close, though they lost men occasionally, and they were most\r\n  materially aided by the fire of the regiments in the cemetery\r\n  behind them, which was directed at the Russian embrasures; so\r\n  that the enemy could not get out to fire on the troops below. The\r\n  9th regiment succeeded in effecting a lodgment in the houses in\r\n  two or three different places, and held their position as well as\r\n  the XVIIIth.... While these portions of the 9th and XVIIIth, and\r\n  parties of the 44th and 28th were in the houses, the detachments\r\n  of the same regiments and of the 38th kept up a hot fire from the\r\n  cemetery on the Russians in the battery and on the sharpshooters,\r\n  all the time being exposed to a tremendous shower of bullets,\r\n  grape, round-shot, shell. The loss of the brigade under such\r\n  circumstances, could not but be extremely severe. One part of\r\n  it, separated from the other, was exposed to a destructive fire\r\n  in houses, the upper portion of which crumbled into pieces or\r\n  fell in under fire, and it was only by keeping in the lower\r\n  storey, which was vaulted and well built, that they were enabled\r\n  to hold their own. The other parts of it, far advanced from our\r\n  batteries, were almost unprotected, and were under a constant\r\n  mitraille and bombardment from guns which our batteries had\r\n  failed to touch.”\r\n\r\nThough the repulse of the main British column left Eyre in a\r\nsituation of hourly increasing peril, he resolutely continued to hold\r\nthe points which the dash and bravery of his troops had gained. At\r\nfirst he hoped that the Redan might yet be stormed, when his brigade\r\nwould be ready to follow up the victory; and when it became clear\r\nthat the attack was not to be renewed he declined to fall back,\r\nuntil an authority higher than his own had decided how much of the\r\nground that his brigade had won was to be retained. Though Eyre was\r\nwounded comparatively early in the day, it was not until late in the\r\nafternoon that, after giving orders for the gradual withdrawal of the\r\ntroops from the houses nearest to the enemy, he made over his command\r\nto the next senior officer and quitted the battlefield. The process\r\nof withdrawal took several hours, and it was not until 9 P.M. that\r\nthe Royal Irish, the last regiment of the brigade to retire, began\r\nits march back to the camp of the third division.\r\n\r\nHow the XVIIIth fared must now be told, as far as possible, in the\r\nwords of the officers who had the honour to be present. Late on the\r\n17th, the rumour had run through the lines of the Royal Irish that\r\nthe town was to be assaulted next day. The men were wild with joy at\r\nthe prospect of taking part in the attack, and talked and sang in\r\ntheir tents so incessantly that the officers could get no rest during\r\nthe few hours allowed the regiment for sleep. At 1 A.M. on the 18th\r\nof June, a date ever memorable in the annals of the regiment, six\r\nhundred and sixty-nine officers and men paraded in front of the camp\r\nof the 9th regiment, where the brigade was formed, the XVIIIth in\r\nfront, the 44th, 38th, 28th, and 9th regiments following in the order\r\nnamed. On the march down the great ravine occurred an interesting\r\ninstance of the rigidity of the drill which, in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, fettered the movements of the British army. It\r\nhas been mentioned that every infantry regiment then had two flank\r\ncompanies of picked men: those of the right, or grenadier company,\r\nwere chosen for height and strength; those of the left, or Light\r\ncompany, were selected for activity and intelligence. On the parade\r\nground the rule was that all battalion movements should be made from\r\nthe right, and consequently that in column the grenadier company\r\nshould always lead. Colonel Edwards had learned in the school of the\r\nChinese and Burmese wars that all drill is but the means to one end,\r\nthe successful attack on an enemy; and thinking that on this occasion\r\nthe quick-moving “Light Bobs” were the men first to be employed,\r\nmarched off “left in front.” This daring innovation did not long pass\r\nunnoticed, and almost within sight of the enemy he was ordered to\r\nhalt, and countermarch his regiment in order to bring the grenadier\r\ncompany to the head of the column. In 1855, the countermarch was an\r\nevolution slow and ponderous in broad daylight, and doubly difficult\r\nof execution in semi-darkness, at a time when the pulses of all\r\nranks were throbbing with the excitement of a night march and an\r\nimpending battle. After the manœuvre was carried out, the brigade\r\nonce more advanced, forming into a mass of close columns whenever the\r\nground permitted. Though it was now almost day the Russians had not\r\nyet detected the presence of Eyre’s troops, and the General took an\r\nopportunity of addressing the Royal Irish, telling them he knew they\r\nwould prove themselves good soldiers and “this day do something that\r\nwill ring in every cabin in Ireland.” Then he added, “Now, men, above\r\nall things you must be quiet or you’ll get peppered!” In answer to\r\nthis very reasonable appeal a shout arose from the ranks, “All right,\r\nyour Honour, we’ll get in. Three cheers for the General!” Before the\r\nofficers could stop them the men had given three lusty cheers. Eyre\r\nremonstrated, but the Royal Irish were far too eager for the fray to\r\nbe sensible, and in response to his reiterated entreaties for silence\r\nthey burst out into stentorian cheering, this time for Old Ireland.\r\n“Let them go in and attack,” cried the General in despair; “they will\r\nonly draw fire upon us!”\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written by Colonel Edwards two days after the battle,\r\nit appears that while the advance-guard was driving the Russians from\r\nthe cemetery at the point of the bayonet, the XVIIIth\r\n\r\n  “halted in the open ready for action. Just here the first\r\n  round-shot danced among us, and as the advance party had\r\n  extended and were under such cover as they could find, we met\r\n  the intruder. That peculiar thud (once heard, never forgotten)\r\n  denoted that the round-shot had told, two men being killed. But\r\n  we were compelled to wait a little longer, and then the Grenadier\r\n  company moved off in skirmishing order, soon followed by Nos. 1\r\n  and 2 companies. These three companies occupied the ruined houses\r\n  on the Woronzoff road.”\r\n\r\nAs the grenadiers, led by Captain Armstrong, were pressing forward\r\nthey found their way obstructed by one of the stone walls mentioned\r\nin General Eyre’s report. Two subalterns raced for the wall, and\r\nleapt it at the same moment: Lieutenant Taylor landed safely on the\r\nother side, but Lieutenant Meurant was shot dead as he rose at the\r\njump. Soon afterwards the remainder of the regiment in column of\r\nsections was moved forward in support, along a lane leading towards\r\nthe suburb from the great ravine, the rocky cliffs of which gave the\r\nXVIIIth some cover from cannon shot. The Russian riflemen, however,\r\nspeedily found the range, “and the men,” says Colonel Edwards,\r\n\r\n  “commenced to fall fast. The General had given me orders to stand\r\n  there, but the casualties were then so great that I put the men\r\n  behind the houses and walls, which saved them much. I did not see\r\n  the General again; he was wounded across the head.\r\n\r\n  “All this time the men were coming back from the front, hopping\r\n  or crouching according to the nature of the wound, amongst them\r\n  my friend Captain Hayman, supported by two men, shot through\r\n  the knee, but with a cheerful smile on his face. Seeing that\r\n  the advance was much weakened I supported them with two other\r\n  companies, sending Major Kennedy to the front; he was shortly\r\n  after slightly hit on the side of the head, but not compelled\r\n  to return. The enemy knew well the position of the houses they\r\n  were in, and threw the shell amongst them. Fancy one of these\r\n  visitors falling within ten feet of you--down you must lie, and\r\n  close too, and wait for its bursting, when you are fortunate if\r\n  you have nothing worse than dust to complain of! They not only\r\n  gave shells, but rifle-balls and grape, and many a poor fellow\r\n  who went out to help a wounded comrade was obliged in his turn to\r\n  be carried in desperately wounded.\r\n\r\n  “Again the front calls out for ammunition and more men. ‘Up, my\r\n  boys, catch hold of that barrel of ammunition, and rush through\r\n  the whizzing balls, the tearing grape!’ Away they go with a\r\n  cheer! About 12 o’clock the last company but one went out and\r\n  other companies, returning, dreadfully thinned, formed the\r\n  support. Shortly after one, more men were wanted; I sent out the\r\n  last company and went myself. Away we hop from stone to stone\r\n  or bush: ‘ping-ping’ passes the rifle-bullet crashing around\r\n  you; you feel the grape; never mind, on you must go! I found the\r\n  advanced parties in a row of houses under the battery, regularly\r\n  enclosed by a screen of projectiles; you could only creep about.\r\n  In the morning these houses had been occupied by the Russians;\r\n  by the time I got there, everything was broken:--pier glasses in\r\n  shivers; the piano (or as a man called it, the music-box) torn\r\n  open; beds, tables and wardrobes in jumbles of masses. The enemy\r\n  did not like our being there, nor did they like that the houses\r\n  gave us cover; they therefore set fire to them with shells. About\r\n  3 o’clock I received an order to retire, which I could not comply\r\n  with as there were eighteen wounded men to bring away, which\r\n  could not be done till dark.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Colonel Edwards, the three companies of the XVIIIth in\r\nthe ruined houses on the Woronzoff road and the other battalions\r\nof the brigade also received this order, and gradually drew back,\r\nleaving the greater part of the Royal Irish in a most dangerous\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n  “Every moment our small party was decreasing. What weary hours\r\n  they seemed from three till eight, and just before it was time to\r\n  move, the enemy brought field-pieces to bear upon the houses,\r\n  and they commenced knocking them down about our heads. At last I\r\n  heard with joy ‘The last wounded man has been carried off, Sir.’\r\n  ‘Well, then, go away by twos and threes: keep up a warm fire.\r\n  When across the open, bugler, sound the Regimental Call and the\r\n  Retire.’\r\n\r\n  “The work is done, but out of 669 men who left the camp, 250 of\r\n  the Royal Irish had suffered more or less. We did not get home\r\n  till ten o’clock, wearied and exhausted. The remainder of the\r\n  brigade acted on our right, and the 44th lost nearly as many in\r\n  proportion as we did. Our brigade was more than successful, and\r\n  have received great praise, especially the Royal Irish regiment.”\r\n\r\nIn so broken and disjointed a combat it is always difficult for the\r\nGeneral to select officers and men for special commendation. Eyre\r\nappears to have found it impossible to do so, and after stating in\r\nhis report that every one in his brigade “most nobly performed his\r\nduty,” and that “the conduct of all was so exemplary that he could\r\nscarcely with justice particularize individuals,” he contented\r\nhimself with mentioning the names of his staff and the officers\r\ncommanding the advance-guard and the five regiments of the brigade.\r\nColonel Edwards’ report on the part played by the XVIIIth doubtless\r\nrecorded some of the deeds of valour performed by the Royal Irish;\r\nbut unhappily no copy of this document has been preserved in the\r\narchives of the regiment. His letter, vivid and deeply interesting\r\nas it is, was written, it is believed, for the information of Her\r\nMajesty, Queen Victoria, and aims obviously at giving a general\r\naccount of the engagement, without any unnecessary detail. The\r\n“Digest of Service” should have contained every particular of the\r\ndoings of the regiment, but unfortunately it was compiled by an\r\nofficer who recorded the adventures of the XVIIIth in the Crimea in\r\ntwo or three loosely-written pages of foolscap, from which everything\r\nof historical value was omitted. Thus the only accounts of the\r\nexploits of the Royal Irish on the 18th of June are to be found in\r\na few statements, contributed by officers many years after the war\r\nwas over, and in the dry official words announcing the bestowal of\r\ndecorations. Every soldier knows that for one specially brave deed\r\nreported after an engagement, scores pass unnoticed or are forgotten,\r\nand therefore the instances now given can be regarded only as\r\nspecimens of the conduct of the regiment as a whole.\r\n\r\nCaptain Thomas Esmonde was awarded the Victoria Cross[173] for two\r\nacts of bravery, the first of which was performed on the 18th of\r\nJune. The Gazette runs as follows: “for having, after being engaged\r\nin the attack on the Redan,[174] repeatedly assisted at great\r\npersonal risk under a heavy fire of shell and grape, in rescuing\r\nwounded men from exposed situations; and also, while in command of a\r\ncovering party two days after, for having rushed with the most prompt\r\nand daring gallantry to a spot where a fire-ball from the enemy had\r\njust been lodged, which he effectually extinguished before it had\r\nbetrayed the position of the working party under his protection,\r\nthus saving it from a murderous fire of shell and grape, which was\r\nimmediately opened upon the spot where the fire-ball had fallen.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillon volunteered to rescue from under a heavy fire of grape\r\nand musketry seven wounded men, who were lying in the houses nearest\r\nto the Russian works, and succeeded in doing so.\r\n\r\nSergeant John Grant belonged to one of the companies in the houses\r\nnearest to the Russian battery, and brought a message from his\r\ncaptain to Colonel Edwards. When Colonel Edwards saw that Sergeant\r\nGrant was bleeding from two severe wounds he desired him to fall back\r\nout of harm’s way, but Grant so earnestly begged to be allowed to\r\nreturn to his officer that Colonel Edwards permitted him once more to\r\nrisk his life in crossing the fire-swept belt of ground between the\r\nsupports and his own company. Grant lived for many years to enjoy an\r\nannuity of £20, which accompanied the medal for meritorious service\r\nin the field, awarded to him for this act of bravery.\r\n\r\nLieutenant T. D. Baker displayed great gallantry throughout the day,\r\nas did Sergeant John Gleeson, Corporal Niel O’Donnell, and privates\r\nJ. Weir, E. Loughton, and J. Byrne.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the spirit shown by the wounded who were left\r\nupon the field, this story is quoted from Russell’s account of the\r\nbattle. During the armistice of the 19th for the collection of the\r\nwounded and the burial of the dead, Major-General Eyre came to the\r\npart of the cemetery where a sergeant of the Royal Irish lay, with\r\nboth his legs broken by a round-shot. “General,” exclaimed the\r\nnon-commissioned officer, “thank God, _we_ did _our_ work, anyway.\r\nHad I another pair of legs, the country and you would be welcome to\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nThe operations of the 17th and 18th cost the French 3500 men,\r\nthe British 1500, the Russians 5400, and of the six generals and\r\ncommanders, French and English, who led the attacks on the 18th,\r\nfour were killed and one disabled. When Eyre’s casualty returns\r\nwere made up, it was found that his brigade had lost 562 killed and\r\nwounded. To this total the Royal Irish contributed no less than 259,\r\nalmost 39 per cent of the regiment as it went into action. Among the\r\nofficers, Lieutenant J. W. Meurant was killed, and ten were wounded,\r\nseveral being dangerously or severely injured. They were--Major J.\r\nC. Kennedy; Captains J. Cormick, A. W. S. F. Armstong, M. Hayman, H.\r\nF. Stephenson, and J. G. Wilkinson; Lieutenants W. O’B. Taylor, W.\r\nKemp, F. Fearnley, and C. Hotham. Of the other ranks 57 were killed\r\nor mortally wounded, 16 were dangerously and 87 severely wounded,\r\nand 88 more slightly injured.[175] The wounded were gradually carried\r\nback to the camp of the IIIrd brigade, which they soon filled to\r\noverflowing. To our modern ideas the preparations for their reception\r\nwere singularly rough. “So many of us had been hit,” writes Captain\r\nKemp, who himself had been struck by a bullet in the knee, “that\r\nthe orderly room and mess huts and every other available place was\r\nappropriated for our use. At first my leg was doomed to come off,\r\nand I was laid on the amputation table for the purpose, but as I was\r\ntoo weak then it was left on till the morrow. Next day I was allowed\r\nto retain it by the decision of one of the staff surgeons, who said,\r\nmost luckily for me, ‘Let us give the poor lad a chance,’ but I\r\nbecame very ill from fever and the intense heat of the tent,[176] and\r\nshortly afterwards was ordered home. I was moved to Balaclava in one\r\nof the ‘carrying chairs’ slung on the side of a mule, and fainted\r\nnearly all the way from sun and weakness.”\r\n\r\nAfter their double repulse at the Malakoff and the Redan the Allies\r\nlost no time in resuming the ordinary operations of the siege: their\r\napproaches were steadily pushed forward, and their guns kept up a\r\nheavy fire upon the fortress. In July the average daily loss in\r\nSebastopol was two hundred and fifty, while each day in August saw\r\nthe strength of the garrison diminished by eight or nine hundred\r\nofficers and men. The Russians, magnificently stubborn fighters as\r\nthey were, began to realise that the place was becoming untenable.\r\nThe parapets were crumbling under the projectiles of the Anglo-French\r\nartillery; many guns were disabled or worn out, and though there\r\nwas still a large reserve of cannon in the arsenal, the fire of our\r\nmortars made it impossible to mount them on the shattered batteries.\r\nRound the disabled guns the dead lay in great heaps, while the\r\nwounded could not be moved till darkness brought some respite to the\r\nharassed garrison. Barracks, arsenals, and store-houses were all more\r\nor less in ruins; and the hospitals, overflowing into the streets and\r\nsquares of the town, were rapidly emptied into a cemetery, grimly\r\ntermed “the grave of the Hundred Thousand.” Towards the end of August\r\nthe Russians determined to abandon Sebastopol; they began to build\r\na bridge across the outer harbour, strong enough to carry guns and\r\nwaggons upon its sixteen feet of roadway; threw up barricades across\r\nthe streets of the town, and laid great mines under the forts and\r\nmagazines. On the 5th of September, the Allies once more brought all\r\ntheir guns into action, and bombarded the fortress, almost without\r\nintermission, for three days and nights, and on the 8th, the French\r\nonce more assaulted the Malakoff, and the British the Redan. As the\r\nthird division was in the reserve and did not come into action,\r\nthe XVIIIth regiment was not engaged, and therefore all that need\r\nbe said about the result is that we failed to take the Redan, while\r\nthe French carried the Malakoff, and succeeded in holding it against\r\nthe strenuous efforts of the enemy to recapture it. These attacks\r\nwere made by the Russian rear-guard to gain time for the retreat of\r\nthe main body from the southern shores of the harbour, and were so\r\nfar successful that when the French General heard that the head of\r\nthe enemy’s column was marching over the bridge, he was still too\r\nuncertain of ultimate success to attempt any interference with the\r\nretirement. During the night the Russians successfully exploded many\r\nof their mines; destroyed their few remaining warships; set fire to\r\nthe town in many places, and called in the troops from the forts;\r\nand by daybreak on the 9th the whole of the garrison, carrying with\r\nthem most of the wounded, had crossed the bridge, broken it behind\r\nthem, and found safety on the heights to the north of the harbour\r\nof Sebastopol. The losses on both sides in this, the last important\r\nepisode in the Crimean War, were very heavy. Our defeat at the Redan\r\ncost us 2271 officers and men, among whom were three generals,\r\nwounded: the French casualties amounted to 7567 of all ranks,\r\nincluding five generals killed and four wounded: the Russians lost\r\nnine generals and 12,906 other officers and men.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the fortress the war in the Crimea came virtually\r\nto an end. The Allies had accomplished their self-imposed task of\r\ndestroying Sebastopol and the Black Sea fleet; there was no immediate\r\nobject to be gained by a pitched battle with the Russian Field army;\r\ndisagreements on questions of future policy caused a considerable\r\namount of friction between the Ministers of Queen Victoria and the\r\nEmperor Napoleon III., and fettered the movements of the Generals,\r\nwho engaged in no further operations except two comparatively\r\nunimportant raids against the towns of Eupatoria and Kilburn, in\r\nneither of which the XVIIIth regiment took part. The French, indeed,\r\nwere not anxious, if indeed they were able, to continue the war;\r\nbut the English had atoned, though very tardily, for their previous\r\nneglect of their army, by preparing so energetically for another\r\ncampaign, that in November there were in the Crimea 51,000 British\r\ntroops, a contingent of 20,000 Turks, raised, trained, and officered\r\nby Englishmen, and a German legion of ten thousand men.[177] The\r\ngood health of this large body of soldiery showed how excellent\r\nour system of administration had become at the seat of war; at\r\nhome recruits were forthcoming in great numbers; the militia had\r\nrelieved the troops in the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean\r\nof much garrison duty; Malta was full of trained soldiers, eager\r\nto be employed on active service; in short, the Army, purified by\r\nthe ordeal it had passed through, had become once more a first-rate\r\nfighting machine. But the troops arriving after the fall of the\r\nfortress had no opportunity of distinguishing themselves, for though\r\nthe enemy annoyed us by cannonading Sebastopol from the northern\r\nshore of the harbour, he made no offensive movement against the\r\ncamps on the Upland. Thus the second winter in the Crimea was a\r\ntime of comparative rest for the greater part of the army, though\r\nnot for the regiments placed at the disposal of the Royal Engineers\r\nto complete the destruction of the forts, arsenals, and dockyards\r\nof the fortress. To the Royal Irish fell a very heavy task, the\r\ndemolition of the docks in the inner harbour. As Colonel Edwards\r\nwas senior to the engineer officer in charge of the work, the\r\nheadquarters of the XVIIIth remained outside the town, and Major\r\nCall was placed in command of the working parties, which practically\r\nconsisted of the whole of the Royal Irish. The labour of preparing\r\nthe docks for destruction was very great, and the hardships of the\r\nmen extreme: to quote the words of the general order of February 7,\r\n1856, praising the zeal and perseverance of all ranks, and thanking\r\nMajor Call, among other officers, for his valuable services, “the\r\nwork was carried out in the depth of winter; the docks occasionally\r\nflooded, the shafts filled with water, the pumps choked with frost;\r\nbut all ranks united to overcome difficulties, and the mass of ruins\r\nis a proof of the success attending the cheerful performance of a\r\nlaborious duty.”\r\n\r\nThis official record is not the only testimony to the good behaviour\r\nof the Royal Irish while they worked like navvies in the docks.\r\nGeneral C. G. Gordon, who as a young officer of Royal Engineers had\r\nserved in the Crimea, replied to a request for information about the\r\ndoings of the XVIIIth at the siege of Sebastopol in a characteristic\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n  “PORT LOUIS, 3/3/82.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR MAJOR SAVILE,--Thanks for your note received to-day. I\r\n  am afraid I cannot write anything which would be of value about\r\n  the 18th Royal Irish, as it is now 28 years ago or nearly so,\r\n  since the Crimea. I know that they were a favourite regiment with\r\n  the R.E. for work, both in the trenches and in the destruction\r\n  of the docks, from the energy and pluck of the officers and men,\r\n  and it was then that I formed my opinion of Irishmen being of a\r\n  different nature than other Britishers inasmuch as they required\r\n  a certain management and consideration, which, if given them,\r\n  would enable you, so to speak, to hold their lives in your hand.\r\n  The officers liked the men and the men liked the officers; they\r\n  were a jovial lot altogether, but they would do anything if you\r\n  spoke and treated them as if you liked them, which I certainly\r\n  did. You know what great hardships they went through in the Docks\r\n  in working at the shafts which, 30 feet deep, were often full\r\n  of water, if left, unpumped out, for 12 hours. Poor devils! wet,\r\n  draggled, in their low ammunition boots, I used to feel much for\r\n  them, for the Generals used to be down on them because they were\r\n  troublesome, which they were when people did not know how to\r\n  manage them.\r\n\r\n  “Kindest regards to General Edwards, a fine, clever old officer\r\n  who had all our respect.\r\n\r\n  “I am sorry I can write you no details.--Believe me, yours\r\n  sincerely,\r\n\r\n  “C. G. GORDON.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that neither in the official expression of thanks\r\nnor in Gordon’s letter is there any reference to the fact that the\r\nRussians frequently shelled the working parties at the docks. The\r\ntroops were so used to being under fire that they looked upon it as\r\nan everyday occurrence, and a few casualties were considered unworthy\r\nof notice. Thanks, however, to Colonel Elliot’s diary, we know that\r\nrheumatic fever and frost-bite were not the only dangers to which the\r\nRoyal Irish were exposed. On December 3, 1855, the Russians fired two\r\nhundred and fifty shells, wounding four men of the regiment; on the\r\n21st they dropped three shells into a barrack-room, luckily without\r\nhitting any one, but smashing beds, knapsacks, and rifles in every\r\ndirection; on the last day of the year a shell carried away the arm\r\nof a private, ---- Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nWhile with immense difficulty the English and French engineers\r\nwere levelling the naval and military buildings to the ground, and\r\nshattering the docks beyond all hope of restoration, the diplomatists\r\nof Europe were doing their utmost to bring hostilities to an end;\r\nlate in February an armistice was arranged, and on the 30th of\r\nMarch, 1856, the world was gladdened by the news that peace had been\r\nproclaimed. The effort to save Constantinople from the Russians,\r\nthough successful, had cost England dear, as these grim figures show--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n                        |        |        |         |         |\r\n                        | Killed.| Died of| Died of | Wounded.| Total.\r\n                        |        | Wounds.| Disease.|         |\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Officers              |    157 |     86 |     147 |     515 |    905\r\n                        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Non-Commissioned      |        |        |         |         |\r\n      Officers          |    161 |     85 |     574 |     579 |  1,399\r\n                        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Privates              |  2,437 |  1,848 |  15,320 |  10,782 | 30,387\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n                        |  2,755 |  2,019 |  16,041 |  11,876 | 32,691\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nThough our Allies also suffered severely, the losses of the Western\r\nPowers and of the Ottoman Empire pale into insignificance before\r\nthose of the Russians. During the last six months of the siege\r\n81,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in or around Sebastopol; the\r\nwhole campaign in the Crimea cost the Czar 153,000 troops; while the\r\nreinforcements from the interior of Russia endured such terrible\r\nhardships on the march to the Black Sea that hundreds of thousands of\r\nmen broke down on the way. It is believed that Russia’s total loss\r\nduring the war was not less than half a million of men.\r\n\r\nThe casualties in the XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment were--\r\n\r\n  _Officers_--\r\n\r\n  Killed            Lieutenant J. W. Meurant.\r\n  Died of disease   Lieutenant E. D. Ricard.\r\n  Wounded           Major J. C. Kennedy.\r\n                    Captains J. Cormick, A. W. S. F. Armstrong,\r\n                      M. Hayman, H. F. Stephenson,\r\n                      J. Wilkinson.\r\n                    Lieutenants W. O’B. Taylor, W. Kemp, F.\r\n                      Fearnley, C. Hotham.\r\n\r\nIn the other ranks, 41 were killed, 44 died of wounds, 70 died from\r\naccident or disease, and 275 were wounded. Their names will be found\r\nin Appendix 2 (I).[178]\r\n\r\nDuring the first nine months of its service in the Crimea, the\r\nregiment was reinforced by 289 non-commissioned officers and men,\r\nwho arrived in drafts from home, and later from Malta where the\r\nfour reserve companies were stationed; and on September 9, although\r\nbetween 140 and 150 men had been killed or died in hospital, and\r\n219 had been invalided or become ineffective from various causes,\r\nthere remained, exclusive of officers, no less than 724 effectives\r\npresent with the Colours.[179] The XVIIIth regiment was among the\r\nlast to leave the Crimea; it was not until June 20, that it embarked\r\non H.M.S. _Majestic_, an eighty-gun ship, fitted with an auxiliary\r\nscrew. Though the crew received their soldier passengers most\r\nhospitably, the voyage was not an agreeable one. The subalterns were\r\nberthed in the cockpit, where, as one of them recorded in his diary,\r\n“there was no room to wash, or dress, or put our baggage; sentries\r\nand reliefs passed through our sleeping-place all night long, shaking\r\nus out of our hammocks; then at a certain hour ruthless sailors came\r\nand packed away the hammocks, whether you wanted to get up or not;\r\nand finally, there was no place to be sick, for the bulwarks were\r\nso high that you could not see over them!” On the 18th of July the\r\nRoyal Irish landed at Portsmouth, entrained for Farnborough, and were\r\nmarching thence to Aldershot when they were ordered to quicken their\r\npace as Queen Victoria was waiting to welcome the regiment. Colonel\r\nEdwards thus describes Her Majesty’s inspection of the soldiers who\r\nhad fought her battles in China, Burma, and the Crimea: “When formed\r\nin line the appearance of the regiment showed signs of service, the\r\nold clothing, long beards, and the dust of the march giving the men\r\nbut a sorry aspect. Her Majesty, passing down the line on foot,\r\nrequested me to point out men most deserving of her notice. My answer\r\nwas, ‘Were I to do so, the whole regiment would step to the front.’\r\nHowever, several of the wounded officers and men were presented. When\r\nthe Queen arrived in front of the Colours, I respectfuly submitted to\r\nHer Majesty that the regimental badge of the Harp and Crown had been\r\nremoved from the uniforms of the men, and the Queen most graciously\r\ngave orders that they should be restored.”\r\n\r\nFor their services in the Crimea many officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and men received promotion or reward. Lieutenant-Colonels\r\nC. A. Edwards and J. C. Kennedy were appointed to be Companions\r\nof the Order of the Bath; Edwards also was made a Brevet-Colonel;\r\nMajor G. F. S. Call, Captains J. Cormick, A. W. S. F. Armstrong, J.\r\nLaurie, and M. J. Hayman each received a step in brevet rank. Captain\r\nT. Esmonde was one of the first to receive the Victoria Cross, and\r\nthe newly instituted medal for distinguished conduct in the field\r\nwas awarded to Sergeant H. Morton, Corporals M. Egan and T. Murphy,\r\nand the following private soldiers, viz., R. Baglin, E. Erwin, T.\r\nFlannery, H. Forrestall, R. Marshall, W. Major, J. M. Guinness, N.\r\nO’Neill, J. Sessman, 2830 P. Whelan, 3521 P. Whelan.[180] In the\r\nmatter of foreign decorations the XVIIIth fared well, as each of our\r\nAllies presented orders or medals to specially deserving officers\r\nand men. Brevet-Colonel Edwards, Brevet-Majors Armstrong and Hayman,\r\nSergeant-Major T. Watt, and Sergeant J. Grant were created members\r\nof the French Legion of Honour by Napoleon III., who also bestowed\r\nwar medals on Colour-Sergeant E. Dunne, Sergeant J. Harvey, Sergeant\r\nJ. Gleeson, Corporal N. O’Donnell, and Privates J. Cox, E. Laughton,\r\nand J. Byrne. Victor Emmanuel gave the Sardinian war medal to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel J. C. Kennedy, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Call,\r\nLieutenant T. D. Baker, and Private J. Weir. The Turkish Order of\r\nthe Medjidie was awarded to Colonel Edwards, Lieutenant-Colonel J.\r\nC. Kennedy, Brevet-Major Cormick, and Lieutenants C. Hotham, O’B.\r\nTaylor, W. Kemp, and C. J. Coote. The British medal for the Crimea\r\nand clasp for Sebastopol and the Turkish medal were awarded to all\r\nwho had taken part in the siege, and the word “Sebastopol” added to\r\nthe battle honours of the regiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 6.\r\n\r\n  Sketch Map\r\n  of the\r\n  CRIMEA\r\n  1855-56\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K.

On the 25th of August,\r\nnew Colours were presented by the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, the old Colours finding a fitting resting-place in St\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral, where they hang over the monuments to the Royal\r\nIrishmen who laid down their lives for their country in the swamps\r\nof China, in the jungles of Burma, and on the blood-stained glacis\r\nof the fortress of Sebastopol. A few months later the regiment was\r\nwarned for foreign service, this time at the Cape of Good Hope, but\r\nthe order was cancelled when the news reached England that the native\r\narmy of Bengal had mutinied, and the XVIIIth remained in Ireland,\r\nvery indignant at not being sent at once to help quell the rising\r\nin India. It was not until the autumn of 1857 that the War Office\r\ndetermined to employ the Royal Irish in the East: an advance party of\r\nthree companies (in all, 208 officers and men) embarked on September\r\n24, followed in two months by headquarters and the remainder of the\r\nXVIIIth (666 of all ranks), who reached Bombay early in February,\r\n1858.[181] They landed, hoping to be in time to take an active part\r\nin the campaign, and their disappointment was bitter when they were\r\nordered to Poona, a great city in the Bombay Presidency. The Royal\r\nIrish found much heavy work awaiting them, for the place was then, as\r\nit still is, a hot-bed of sedition, ready to revolt at any moment;\r\nand the troops were constantly under arms to prevent an outbreak.\r\nBut as the accounts of successive British victories in northern and\r\ncentral India reached the malcontents, the danger diminished, and in\r\nApril, 1858, the local situation had sufficiently improved to warrant\r\nthe withdrawal of part of the British garrison from Poona. On the\r\nRoyal Irish was thrown the duty of providing detachments in various\r\nplaces in western India, to watch native regiments of doubtful\r\nloyalty, and help the civil power in re-establishing law and order\r\nround their posts. With the dispersal of the regiment disappeared its\r\nchances of service as a complete unit, but each company commander\r\nstill hoped to have to deal individually with a body of rebels, or\r\nwith one of the bands of marauders called into existence by the\r\nmutiny. Fate, however, was not kind to the Royal Irish in 1858-59:\r\nthe strenuous work of the detachments was unrelieved by a single\r\nfight, and even when three or four companies were brought together\r\nfor some combined movement they had no luck; in extreme heat they\r\nmade forced marches, cut roads through jungle, forded rivers, but all\r\nto no purpose: wherever they went the enemy disappeared, to fall into\r\nthe hands of some column operating many miles away.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from D^r Ffolliott, one of the regimental\r\nassistant-surgeons, are preserved a few details of the experiences\r\nof one of the detachments. Captain J. Canavan started from Poona on\r\nApril 23, 1858, with two subalterns and a hundred and twenty of the\r\nRoyal Irish, a company of Bombay native infantry, camel transport,\r\nand dhoolies for the sick and wounded, and at the end of a month’s\r\nhard marching brought his column to Asseerghur without a casualty\r\nand with no sick men. According to Ffolliott, who was in medical\r\ncharge, this immunity from disease was due to the care taken to keep\r\nthe men’s clothing dry at the numerous fords through which the road\r\nran: the troops were allowed ample time to undress before going into\r\nthe water, and to put their clothes on again before the march was\r\nresumed. Asseerghur was an old native fortress, perched on the top of\r\nan almost perpendicular rock rising nearly eight hundred feet out of\r\nthe plain. As it had never been occupied by European troops, there\r\nwere no barracks; the men were quartered in an old mosque; while the\r\nofficers occupied a large bungalow, where they used to entertain a\r\nfew European ladies who had taken refuge in Asseerghur while their\r\nhusbands were in the field. Every week there was a dinner-party,\r\nfollowed by a dance to the drums and fifes of the detachment.\r\n\r\nOn his way to take up the command of a brigade at Mhow, Colonel\r\nEdwards was present at one of these entertainments, where he must\r\nhave been pleased at the determination of his officers to keep up\r\ntheir spirits under the bitter disappointment of finding themselves\r\nthus completely “sidetracked.” In November, Asseerghur was greatly\r\nexcited at the report that Tantia Tope was in the neighbourhood.\r\nTantia was one of the few native leaders who had shown good military\r\nqualities; he had fought well against Lord Strathnairn (then Sir\r\nHugh Rose) in central India, and when after many defeats he had\r\nbetaken himself to the country north of the Nerbudda, he had evaded\r\nthe columns threatening him from many directions. The net, however,\r\nwas now closing in upon him; it was believed he would try to break\r\nsouthwards into the Deccan, and as Asseerghur commanded one of the\r\napproaches to this part of India it became a place of temporary\r\nimportance. One evening the Fort Adjutant bustled into the quarters\r\nof the XVIIIth with great news: in a few hours Tantia Tope, with\r\neight or nine thousand men, was going to attack Burhanpore, a rich\r\nand populous town not many miles away; Canavan with fifty men of the\r\nRoyal Irish was to throw himself into the city, and Ffolliott was\r\nto accompany him. While Canavan was issuing his orders, Ffolliott\r\nwent off to make medical arrangements at the hospital, where, to\r\nuse his own words, “I found every sick man in war paint. My acting\r\nhospital sergeant said there was not much the matter with them; they\r\nhad heard there was to be a fight that night, and wanted to join the\r\nparty going, so I discharged them out of hospital. Canavan made no\r\ndistinction; the first fifty for duty were ordered to fall out, and\r\nin two hours from the time we were warned we were on the march.”\r\nAs Canavan and his party were considered to be going on a forlorn\r\nhope, every European not on duty was on the parade ground to wish\r\nthe Royal Irish “good luck” as they moved off, and the ladies were\r\nin tears, until their grief was changed to mirth at the discovery\r\nthat the doctor had filled his pouch, not with medical appliances,\r\nbut with revolver cartridges. Many of the garrison sat up till dawn,\r\nlistening anxiously for the burst of fire with which it was feared\r\nthe detachment would be overwhelmed. But no crash of musketry broke\r\nthe stillness of the night, and before Canavan reached Burhanpore he\r\nlearned the place had been reinforced by a larger column, with whose\r\nmovements the Commandant of Asseerghur was unacquainted, and that\r\nTantia Tope had disappeared. As no fighting was expected, Canavan was\r\nordered to return to his own post without delay--another instance\r\nof bad luck, for in a day or two there was a sharp skirmish near\r\nBurhanpore, in which his company would certainly have taken part.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1859, the greater part of the regiment was brought\r\ntogether under Lieutenant-Colonel Call, and made many marches through\r\nthe district of Jaulna, vainly pursuing Rohilla freebooters who had\r\nno intention of standing up to fight. As soon as these robber bands\r\ndispersed, the XVIIIth went back to garrison duty at detached posts,\r\nand in three or four months, when the country had begun to settle\r\ndown, most of the companies joined headquarters at Sholapur, and then\r\nmarched to Hyderabad in the Deccan, which they reached on June 21,\r\n1859. The muster roll shows that three officers, Captain W. F. G.\r\nForster, Lieutenant T. Watt, and Assistant-Surgeon C. E. Porteous,\r\nand twenty-seven of the rank and file died of disease during the\r\nIndian Mutiny campaign.[182]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1858-1882.\r\n\r\nRAISING OF THE SECOND BATTALION: THE WAR IN NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Indian Mutiny a considerable increase in the strength of\r\nthe army was sanctioned by Parliament, for the reasons stated in\r\nchapter x., and additional units of infantry were raised, not as new\r\nregiments but as second battalions of existing organisations. The\r\nXVIIIth was one of the regiments selected for this augmentation,\r\nand on March 25, 1858, forty-four years after the original second\r\nbattalion had been disbanded,[183] the nucleus of a new second\r\nbattalion was formed at Enniskillen by the transfer from the first\r\nbattalion of a hundred seasoned soldiers.[184] A hundred and fifty\r\nmen joined from the Dublin City militia; other militia regiments\r\ncontributed volunteers, and recruits came in fast from the north of\r\nIreland. For the first few months of its existence the new battalion\r\nwas in charge of Major A. W. S. F. Armstrong; then Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nA. N. Campbell, on promotion from the first battalion, assumed the\r\ncommand which he continued to hold until October, 1859, when he\r\nexchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel A. A. Chapman, 48th regiment. In\r\nthe same month the battalion was sent to England, and two years\r\nlater to the Channel Isles, where the detachment at Alderney did\r\ngood service in fighting a great fire which threatened to devastate\r\nthe island. Though the greater part of the rank and file was\r\ncomposed of growing lads, “the ready and willing spirit displayed\r\nby all and their coolness under such circumstances”[185] greatly\r\nimpressed the local authorities. This incident proved, if proof had\r\nbeen necessary, that the task of converting a mass of recruits into\r\ntrained and disciplined soldiers had been entrusted to good hands;\r\nand early in 1863, the second battalion was considered to be fit for\r\nforeign service, and was selected to relieve one of the regiments\r\nthen garrisoning New Zealand. When the various detachments from\r\nJersey, Guernsey, and Alderney had concentrated at Parkhurst in the\r\nIsle of Wight, they were inspected by Major-General Lord William\r\nPaulet, who in a complimentary speech commented with pleasure on the\r\ngreat increase in the height of the men since he had last seen the\r\nbattalion eighteen months before.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1863, the headquarters and eight companies under\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman sailed from Portsmouth in\r\nthe ship _Elizabeth Anne Bright_, followed on the 12th by the two\r\nservice companies under Brevet-Colonel G. J. Carey in the ship\r\n_Norwood_.[186] The depôt companies were stationed at Buttevant.\r\nAfter a prosperous and, for a sailing-ship, a rapid voyage of\r\nninety-one days, the _Elizabeth Anne Bright_ on the 4th of July\r\nreached Auckland, where three weeks later the _Norwood_ arrived\r\nalso. When the leading ship dropped anchor, the Royal Irish learned\r\nthat war had broken out with the natives, and that the battalion\r\nwas to take the field at once. Before describing the part played\r\nby the XVIIIth in the campaign a short account must be given of\r\nthe Maoris, the enemy at whose hands the second battalion was to\r\nreceive its baptism of fire. According to native traditions, New\r\nZealand was peopled many centuries ago by an adventurous race (said\r\nby ethnologists to be of Malay stock) who, swarming off from the\r\nMelanesian archipelago, crossed the Southern Pacific in war canoes\r\nand landed in New Zealand, which they named the Land of the Long\r\nWhite Cloud. Either the country was uninhabited or the aborigines\r\nwere easily conquered, for no trace of their presence is found in\r\nMaori folklore. The newcomers first occupied the coasts, and then\r\ngradually spread over the whole of the North and South islands,\r\nforming clans which recognised no central authority and held all land\r\nwithin their borders as the property not of individuals but of the\r\ntribe. Between the tribes there was incessant strife, which hardened\r\nthe Maoris into a nation of fighting men, skilled not only in every\r\nwile of savage warfare but also, as we shall see, in the art of\r\nfortifying their strongholds.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Maoris and the very position of the country they\r\ninhabited remained unknown to Europeans until 1642, when Tasman, the\r\ngreat Dutch navigator, sighted the Land of the Long White Cloud. His\r\ngovernment kept the information to themselves; and Captain Cook, a\r\nBritish explorer even more celebrated than his Dutch forerunner,\r\nrediscovered New Zealand in 1769, established friendly relations\r\nwith the natives, and took formal possession of the country for his\r\nsovereign, George III. But neither at that time nor for many years\r\nlater was England in the mood to develop her new acquisition. Her\r\nconflict with the American colonists, her struggle with the European\r\ncoalition which supported their rebellion, and her gigantic efforts\r\nto save the Continent of Europe from the domination of Napoleon, had\r\ntaxed her resources to the utmost; and it was not until seventy years\r\nafter Cook had annexed the country that definite official steps were\r\ntaken to assert British authority in New Zealand. But long before our\r\nGovernment decided to occupy the islands, adventurous Britons had\r\nestablished themselves among the Maoris. The penal settlement, formed\r\ntowards the close of the eighteenth century at Sydney, provided a\r\nport from which New Zealand became accessible from the mainland of\r\nAustralia, and a brisk trade gradually sprang up between the natives\r\nand ship’s captains in timber, potatoes, and native flax. Nor were\r\nthese the only articles of commerce. Collectors of curiosities\r\nin Europe were eager to possess specimens of the tattooing or\r\nface ornamentation for which the Maoris were celebrated, and the\r\nheads of warriors, defeated and slain in battle and preserved as\r\ntrophies in the villages of the victors, were eagerly exchanged for\r\nthe muskets with which the white strangers were armed. By degrees\r\nlittle settlements of Europeans grew up at various points along the\r\ncoast--each an Alsatia to which escaped convicts, deserters from the\r\ngarrison of Sydney, run-away sailors, riff-raff of every kind, sought\r\na refuge from the trammels of civilisation. Many of these wanderers\r\nthrew in their lot with the natives: some perished miserably;\r\nothers were well treated and lived with the Maoris for many years.\r\nA few of the survivors were men of some education, and from their\r\nreminiscences, and those of the missionaries and pioneers who arrived\r\nfrom England in the early “forties,” it is possible to form an\r\nidea of the Maoris before they became tamed by British influence.\r\nTheir character as a nation was very complex. Though cannibals, and\r\nbloodthirsty to a degree, their sense of honour was high, and their\r\nword once pledged was considered inviolable. They were by no means\r\ndevoid of chivalry; their language was full of poetry; their manners\r\nwere dignified; their laws were well defined, and the tenure of land\r\nand the ownership of movable property were regulated by customs,\r\nenforced by the power of the whole clan.\r\n\r\nIn the course of years the condition of the European settlements\r\nbecame a serious scandal; law and order were unknown, and there\r\nwere constant collisions between the natives and the Europeans, in\r\nwhich the white men appear to have been frequently the aggressors.\r\nThe Governor of New South Wales, who was supposed to exercise a\r\nshadowy authority over the British in New Zealand, reported strongly\r\nto the Colonial Office on the subject, and the missionaries loudly\r\ncomplained that their efforts among the Maoris were hampered by the\r\npresence of a considerable number of Europeans, whose conduct was\r\nunrestrained by any form of government. In 1840, England yielded to\r\nthe pressure of public opinion and formally annexed New Zealand. This\r\nstep, ostensibly taken solely for the benefit of the Maoris, was\r\nalso influenced by political considerations, for the French had long\r\ndesired to establish themselves in the Southern Pacific: ever since\r\nthe time of Cook their ships had occasionally visited New Zealand,\r\nand it was known that France was preparing to found a colony in\r\nthe South island. An English frigate, the _Druid_, sailed with the\r\nnewly-appointed Governor about the same time as _L’Aube_, a French\r\nman-of-war started in charge of a transport full of emigrants for New\r\nZealand. Our ship outstripped the French vessels, and when _L’Aube_\r\nreached the South island her captain, to his bitter mortification,\r\nfound that the Union Jack had been hoisted forty-eight hours before!\r\n\r\nThe terms upon which New Zealand passed into the hands of the Crown\r\nwere almost unique in the history of England. Our possessions in\r\nthe East have been won by the sword in wars forced upon us by the\r\nlawlessness of the neighbouring States. In America the presence of a\r\nlarge French garrison in Canada and at the mouth of the St Lawrence\r\nwas a thunder cloud constantly overhanging the New England colonies\r\nuntil we captured Quebec in the Seven Years’ War. In the southern\r\nhemisphere Australia was a no-man’s land--a wilderness inhabited only\r\nby a few tribes of degraded savages. The necessity of defending the\r\ncolonists in South Africa against the attacks of marauding Kaffirs\r\nhas caused the gradual extension of British rule from Cape Town on\r\nthe Atlantic to Zululand on the Indian Ocean. But in New Zealand\r\nthe chiefs were treated as our equals when, at the solemn treaty of\r\nWaitanga in 1840, they ceded on behalf of their clans the sovereignty\r\nof their territories to Queen Victoria, and accepted her protection,\r\nand with it all the rights and privileges of British subjects.\r\n\r\nFor several years after this treaty was made the country seemed\r\nthoroughly quiet: large numbers of emigrants arrived from England\r\nand prospered greatly in their new homes; and the majority of Maoris\r\nappeared to acquiesce in our presence. Some of the clans were glad to\r\nbe saved from internecine strife; others appreciated the increased\r\ndemand for their staple productions of flax and timber, which was one\r\nof the results of the European influx; but others again, especially\r\nthe tribes in the centre of the North island, grew dissatisfied with\r\nthe new order of things, and elected a king to rule over them,\r\nwho established a capital at Ngaruawahia, a strategic point at the\r\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers.[187] From a mistaken policy\r\nof non-intervention this movement was not put down, and it rapidly\r\ndegenerated into openly expressed antagonism towards the settlers.\r\nIn 1862, to quote the words of one of the Ministers of the Crown, it\r\n“presented the following features:--\r\n\r\n  “An elected king, a very young man of no force of character,\r\n  surrounded by a few ambitious chiefs who formed a little mock\r\n  court, and by a body-guard who kept him from all vulgar contact\r\n  and from even the inspection of Europeans, except on humiliating\r\n  terms; entirely powerless to enforce among his subjects the\r\n  decisions of his magistrates; an army, if it might be called\r\n  so, of 5000 to 10,000 followers scattered over the country, but\r\n  organised so that large numbers could be concentrated at any\r\n  one point on short notice; large accumulated supplies of food,\r\n  of arms and ammunition; a position in the centre of the island\r\n  from which a descent could be made in a few hours on any of\r\n  the European settlements; roads prohibited to be made through\r\n  two-thirds of the island; the large rivers barred against\r\n  steamers so that nine-tenths of the country was closed against\r\n  the ordinary means of travel and transport; the Queen’s law set\r\n  at utter defiance; her magistrates treated with supercilious\r\n  contempt; her writs torn to pieces and trampled under foot;\r\n  Europeans who had married native women driven out of the King’s\r\n  districts, while their wives and children were taken from\r\n  them, unless they would recognise and pay an annual tribute to\r\n  the King; all this accompanied by an exhibition of the utmost\r\n  arrogance and undisguised contempt for the power of the Queen,\r\n  the Governor and the Europeans.”[188]\r\n\r\nThe safety of the colony was threatened seriously by these sullenly\r\nrebellious tribes; and when in 1863, a body of the King’s followers\r\nintervened in a dispute between Maoris and Europeans in the\r\nsouth-west of the North island, war became inevitable. The King’s\r\nparty, which was largely composed of the Waikato tribe, planned to\r\nopen the campaign by raiding Auckland and exterminating its white\r\ninhabitants. Lieutenant-General Sir Duncan A. Cameron, who was in\r\ncommand of the Imperial troops in New Zealand, and Sir George Grey,\r\nthe Governor of the colony, decided to anticipate the Maoris by\r\nadvancing upon their strongholds in the wild country south of the\r\nWaikato. This river rises in the centre of the North island and winds\r\nits way northwards from its source to within forty miles of Auckland,\r\nwhen it turns sharply to the south-west at the native village of\r\nTe Ta. Here a tributary, the Mangatawhari creek, joins it from the\r\nnorth-east, and the two streams marked the northern limit of the\r\ndistrict held by the followers of the King. Civilisation had spread\r\nabout twenty-five miles to the south of Auckland, and a metalled\r\nroad ran past scores of prosperous farms, tangible proofs of the\r\nsuccess which had attended the colonists in this part of New Zealand.\r\nAt the village of Drury the good road was replaced by a rough and\r\nnarrow track, which winding through a broad belt of bush known as the\r\nHunua forest, crossed very undulating country much cut up by deep\r\nravines, half buried in ferns and scrub. This dense forest, which\r\na series of almost impenetrable thickets rendered ideal for Maori\r\noffensive tactics, was to be the scene of many skirmishes in which\r\ndetachments of the XVIIIth greatly distinguished themselves.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Royal Irish brought up the number of regular\r\nbattalions in New Zealand to seven;[189] but by no means all of\r\nthese were available for the front. It was necessary to keep up the\r\nstrength of the detachments in various parts of both islands; the\r\nline of communication absorbed a great quantity of fighting men, and\r\ngarrisons had to be provided for the settlers in lonely hamlets and\r\nisolated farms. Though at one time during the war the armed whites in\r\nthe colony reached the respectable total of 15,000 men, the greatest\r\nforce of regular and volunteer troops actually under the hand of\r\nthe General at any time appears never to have exceeded two thousand\r\nfive hundred. To form an accurate estimate of the numbers against us\r\nis impossible, for many tribes remained neutral, others were on our\r\nside, while others again took but a fitful part in the operations and\r\npreferred to plunder settlers rather than to meet soldiers in the\r\nfield. One point, however, seems quite clear; on every occasion when\r\nthere was serious fighting we greatly out-numbered our savage but\r\nvery gallant foes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Royal Irish landed they were sent to Otahuhu, a\r\ncamp a little to the south of Auckland, where General Cameron\r\nwas concentrating his troops. Here the battalion received their\r\ncampaigning kit: officers and men were provided with blue serge\r\n“jumpers,” haversacks, water-bottles and pannikins: all ranks carried\r\na blanket and waterproof sheet, rolled, and slung over the left\r\nshoulder; the men were armed with Enfield rifles and bayonets. Five\r\ndays later the column marched through Drury to the Queen’s redoubt,\r\na work which commanded the crossing of the Waikato at Te Ta. A\r\ndetachment of two hundred of the XVIIIth, under Captain Inman, was\r\ndropped at Drury to hold that post on the line of communication, and\r\na few days later the whole of the battalion appears to have been\r\necheloned along the bush track between Drury and the Queen’s redoubt.\r\nOn hearing that Cameron was in motion the Maoris divided their\r\nforces: one column was to hold the British at the Waikato while the\r\nother was to turn Cameron’s left, harass his communications, and if\r\npossible swoop upon Auckland. It was with the enemy’s right wing that\r\nthe Royal Irish were chiefly engaged for the first few months of the\r\nwar, but before giving an account of their doings it is necessary to\r\nsketch very briefly the operations south of the Waikato.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 1863, Cameron crossed the river and dislodged the enemy\r\nfrom the heights of Koheroa above the Mangatawhari creek. He was,\r\nhowever, unable to follow up this initial success; for nearly three\r\nmonths difficulties of land transport, the want of steamers of\r\nsufficiently light draught for river work, and the activity of the\r\nMaoris on his rear prevented further movements against the series\r\nof works which at various points commanded the right bank of the\r\nWaikato. The military genius of the Maoris and its limitations\r\nwere alike revealed in these fortifications, in which the system\r\nof defence evolved by a long series of inter-tribal conflicts had\r\nbeen cleverly adapted to new conditions of war. Before firearms were\r\nintroduced into New Zealand, the\r\n\r\n  “Maoris’ _pahs_, or stockaded and entrenched villages, usually\r\n  perched on cliffs and jutting points overhanging river or sea,\r\n  were defended by a double palisade, the outer fence of stout\r\n  stakes, the inner of high solid trunks. Between them was a\r\n  shallow ditch. Platforms as much as forty feet high supplied\r\n  coigns of vantage for the look-out. Thence, too, darts and stones\r\n  could be hurled at the besiegers. With the help of a throwing\r\n  stick, or rather whip, wooden spears could be thrown in the\r\n  sieges more than a hundred yards. Ignorant of the bow and arrow,\r\n  and the boomerang, the Maoris knew and used the sling; with it\r\n  red-hot stones would be hurled over the palisades among the\r\n  rush-thatched huts of an assaulted village, a stratagem all the\r\n  more difficult to cope with as Maori _pahs_ seldom contained\r\n  wells or springs of water.”[190]\r\n\r\nIn the series of skirmishes dignified by the name of the Maori war\r\nof 1860-61 the natives had carefully studied our tactics and our\r\nweapons; and in the war of 1863-66, in order to bring into play the\r\nmuskets and double-barrelled guns with which they were armed, and\r\nto minimise the effect of our rifle and shell fire, they selected\r\npositions open in front, with flanks resting on rivers, swamps,\r\nor impenetrable bush. They made great use of earthworks and of\r\nredoubts, square or oblong in shape, flanked at opposite angles by\r\nbastions and surrounded by ditches, in some cases twelve feet wide\r\nand measuring eighteen feet from the bottom of the ditch to the top\r\nof the parapet. Pushed out to the front and flanks were two or three\r\ntiers of rifle-pits or short trenches, connected by sunk roads with\r\neach other and with the main work. The marksmen in these pits were\r\noften protected by head cover, made of trunks of trees or of hurdles\r\nthatched with fern and covered deep with earth; and to break the\r\nforce of a bayonet charge, stout palisades were sometimes built in\r\nfront of the rifle-pits with spaces left for grazing fire to sweep\r\nover the glacis. Yet though this system of fortification showed that\r\nto their natural cleverness the Maoris added the power of rapidly\r\nabsorbing new ideas, their intelligence failed them in one essential\r\nparticular. In the selection of a position they never realised the\r\nimportance of a good water-supply, and when an attack was threatened\r\nthey neglected to store their works with water, trusting to their\r\nyoung men to bring in by night the quantity required for the next\r\nday’s consumption. Thus after a close investment of a few days they\r\nhad no alternative but to cut their way out or to surrender.\r\n\r\nWhile General Cameron was waiting for his river steamers, a rumour\r\nreached the Maoris at Meri-Meri, the position nearest to Cameron’s\r\nencampment, that the General and his soldiers were short of food.\r\nUnder a flag of truce the Chiefs sent down the river a little fleet\r\nof canoes laden with potatoes and milch-goats as a present to the\r\nBritish troops. This was by no means an isolated instance of native\r\nchivalry, for, to use the slang of the present day, the Maoris were\r\n“sportsmen,” and always said that there was no glory in fighting\r\nhungry men. When at length the arrival of river craft enabled Cameron\r\nto move, he threatened the front of the works of Meri-Meri with five\r\nhundred men, among whom were a detachment of Royal Irish, while a\r\nturning party of rather greater strength, in barges mounted with\r\nArmstrong guns, was towed to a landing-place in rear of the enemy’s\r\nworks. The Maoris did not await the attack, but fled southwards\r\nacross country which recent rains had made impassable for Europeans.\r\nCameron occupied their position, which the detachment of the XVIIIth\r\nfortified under the direction of the Royal Engineers. In November\r\nthe General took an important step towards freeing the line of\r\ncommunication from the natives who harassed his convoys in the Hunua\r\nforest and ravaged the farms in the neighbourhood of Auckland. Many\r\nof these guerillas came from the country round the estuary of the\r\nThames river, and thither he sent an expedition under Brevet-Colonel\r\nCarey, XVIIIth regiment, to overawe the district and establish a line\r\nof blockhouses between the Thames and the Waikato. While Carey was\r\ncarrying out his mission successfully Cameron pushed up the river,\r\nand on November 20th, attacked the formidable works at Rangiriri,\r\nthe Maoris’ second position on the Waikato. Before the enemy had\r\nbeen thoroughly shaken by artillery the order was given for the\r\nassault, and though repeated and gallant charges were delivered,\r\nthe troops that day achieved but a partial success, bought at the\r\ncost of 132 casualties. Under cover of the night several hundred\r\nof the enemy escaped; the remainder, 183 in number, surrendered\r\nat daybreak and were made prisoners of war. In this engagement\r\nthe Royal Irish were represented only by one officer, Captain and\r\nBrevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Sir H. Havelock, V.C.,[191] then serving on\r\nthe headquarter staff as D.A.Q.M.G., and a few men. The losses at\r\nRangiriri greatly dispirited the enemy, who allowed Cameron to march\r\nunmolested up the right bank of the Waikato, and on December 9, 1863,\r\nto occupy Ngaruawahia, the capital of the rebellious country.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were hard at work on the line of communication during\r\nthis time. Tracks had to be cut through virgin forest and garrisons\r\nprovided for settlers’ farms; convoys needed large escorts, while the\r\nroad along which the waggons lumbered had to be strongly piquetted\r\nand constantly patrolled. In these duties detachments of the XVIIIth\r\nmet with many exciting adventures; they alternately rescued parties\r\nof other regiments from imminent danger or were themselves saved from\r\ndestruction by the timely arrival of reinforcements. Many laurels\r\nwere won in these skirmishes, of which the details, as far as they\r\nhave been preserved, are here recorded.[192] Six days after the\r\nheadquarters of the battalion had reached the Queen’s redoubt Captain\r\nRing, with Ensign Bicknell, two sergeants, and forty-seven rank and\r\nfile, was sent in charge of a convoy to Drury. The track passed\r\nthrough a forest, thus described by an officer of great experience of\r\ncampaigning in the forests of many parts of the British Empire: “The\r\nbush of New Zealand is wonderfully dense and entangled. A European\r\ngoing into it about twenty yards and turning round three times is\r\nquite at a loss to find his way out again unless he is somewhat of an\r\nIndian path-finder and can judge of the points of the compass by the\r\nbark of the trees, the sun, &c. Trying to run through the bush one\r\nis tripped up by the supplejack and other creepers.”[193] While on\r\nthe march Ring fell into an ambuscade of about 140 Maoris; fire was\r\nopened by invisible enemies upon his advance-guard, his right flank,\r\nand his rear; a driver and two horses in the centre of the convoy\r\nfell wounded; the line of waggons was thrown into confusion, and the\r\nMaoris attacked his left flank. He retired immediately with as many\r\nmen as he could concentrate, and, in skirmishing order, kept the\r\nenemy at bay for some time; then seeing himself nearly surrounded he\r\nretreated into a settler’s farm, which he held until some of Inman’s\r\ndetachment at Drury extricated him from his dangerous situation. In\r\nthis affair four men were killed and ten wounded.[194]\r\n\r\nSoon after this affair Ring found himself in charge of a mixed body\r\nof troops at Keri-Keri, on the road which runs north-east from\r\nDrury through the Wairoa country to the coast. With him were five\r\nofficers and about two hundred rank and file of the battalion, and\r\ntwo officers and a hundred men of a New Zealand militia regiment. In\r\nthe morning of the 22nd of July he learned that a number of natives\r\nhad murderously attacked two settlers, and immediately afterwards\r\nheard heavy firing about two miles off near Pukekewereke, where\r\nsixteen volunteers were defending themselves against very heavy odds.\r\nLeaving the militia and two officers and a hundred of his own men to\r\nhold the post, he hurried to the rescue with Lieutenant Wray, Ensigns\r\nJackson and Butts, and the remainder of the Royal Irish. On reaching\r\nthe scene of the skirmish Ring opened fire, and, to use the words of\r\nhis report, “the natives retreated to my former entrenchment above\r\nthe _wharé_[195] at Keri-Keri; the fire of the skirmishers drove them\r\ndown the side of the hill into the brushwood; the leading skirmishers\r\non the right, under Lieutenant Wray, took possession of the hill and\r\nkept up fire on them; I, with another body of skirmishers, proceeding\r\nto take that on the right flank, but found that the natives, who\r\nmustered a strong force, nearly surrounded me; here I lost a man\r\nkilled, whose rifle and bayonet were taken possession of by the\r\nnatives, though not without serious loss to them. I then concentrated\r\nmy men on the entrenchment, and having heard from a Royal Artillery\r\nofficer who rode up to my position that the 65th regiment was in my\r\nimmediate vicinity, I requested that he would inform the officer\r\ncommanding the 65th that there was a track in the enemy’s rear, and\r\nthat if an attack were made in that direction it would be of great\r\nservice. As it was quite impossible for me to follow so strong a\r\nforce of the enemy into the bush with my small force, I remained\r\nin the entrenched position until close on sunset, keeping a steady\r\nfire on the enemy, who were endeavouring to obtain the body of the\r\nprivate who was killed and whom I would not leave. I repeatedly tried\r\nto obtain possession of the body by sending out volunteers of the\r\nman’s company, but desisted, finding it would entail greater loss. I\r\nwas about to retire, leaving a rear-guard in the entrenchment, when\r\nthe mounted artillery arrived.” The gunners were closely followed by\r\na party of the 65th, who threw themselves into the fray with great\r\nspirit. On the appearance of these fresh troops the natives drew off\r\ninto bush so thick that no pursuit was possible, and after the body\r\nof the dead soldier had been recovered the whole force returned to\r\ntheir entrenchments. This affair cost the battalion one man killed\r\nand four wounded.[196] For Ring’s conduct and good judgment on this\r\noccasion General Cameron recommended him for a brevet-majority, to\r\nwhich he had been gazetted in England before he fell mortally wounded\r\nat the engagement of Orakau on March 31, 1864. The detachment was\r\ncommended for the firmness with which they had held their ground\r\nagainst superior numbers.\r\n\r\nThe next time any of the XVIIIth were in action seems to have been on\r\nthe 25th of August. The attack on Ring’s convoy had shown how easily\r\ntraffic could be stopped in the Hunua forest. To make communication\r\nsafer through this belt of bush the Government of New Zealand set\r\na large number of men to cut down the scrub on either side of the\r\nroad. Soldiers as well as civilians were employed on the work;\r\namong the former were a party of a corps which appears not only to\r\nhave been ignorant of the first principles of warfare, but grossly\r\ndisobedient to orders. General Cameron had officially reminded the\r\ntroops that axe-men should always be protected by a covering party;\r\nbut the detachment disregarded this order and, far from taking\r\nprecautions for their safety, piled arms near the road under charge\r\nof a single sentry. The Maoris crawled through the bush, rushed the\r\nsentry, and before the detachment could regain their rifles nearly\r\nall the arms had fallen into the enemy’s hands. Several of the ----\r\nwere hit; the remainder, defenceless without their rifles, had\r\nfallen back for shelter into the forest, when the guard of a convoy,\r\nchiefly composed of a company of the Royal Irish, under Captain R. P.\r\nBishopp, appeared on the scene, and after an hour’s sharp skirmishing\r\nsucceeded in driving away the enemy. In this affair one man of the\r\nXVIIIth was wounded.[197] Early in September the headquarters of\r\nthe Royal Irish were moved to Drury, leaving two companies under\r\nCaptain Noblett to man the Queen’s redoubt. During the month three\r\ndetachments of the battalion had brushes with the enemy. Half a mile\r\nfrom the village of Pokeno, near the Queen’s redoubt, a party of\r\n62 non-commissioned officers and men, under Ensign C. Dawson, were\r\nattacked by a body of natives, who fired into them from the rear. A\r\nbayonet charge drove the enemy into a gully, down which the Royal\r\nIrish pursued them for half a mile, when a burst of war-whoops and\r\nyells from the village warned Dawson to collect his men to meet a\r\nfresh danger. Making his way back to Pokeno, he was received by a\r\nvolley from Maoris hidden among the stumps and logs of timber in a\r\nclearing in front of the village, and from another party on his left\r\nflank. Dawson had his men well in hand, kept them in skirmishing\r\norder, and maintained a steady fire from all available cover, until\r\nhe was extricated from this unpleasant situation by the arrival of a\r\nparty of the 40th, and later by a further reinforcement, the escort\r\nto a convoy commanded by Captain Noblett, XVIIIth regiment. The\r\nMaoris fled before the levelled bayonets of the combined detachments\r\nand took refuge in the bush, into which the soldiers could not\r\nfollow. A few days later, a convoy in charge of a body of volunteers\r\nbroke down at Pukekohe, near Drury; some of the Royal Irish, under\r\nCaptain Inman, were sent to its assistance, and found the waggons\r\nstuck in deep mud, while the Maoris were attacking the stockade which\r\ncontained the garrison of the post. Inman’s party rescued the convoy;\r\nthen, reinforced by the volunteers, they went in with the cold steel,\r\nand received praise from General Cameron for “the gallant manner in\r\nwhich they charged the enemy, driving him back into the bush with\r\nsevere loss from the position he had taken up near the stockade.” For\r\nhis services on this and other occasions Captain Inman received a\r\nBrevet-Majority.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time another party of the XVIIIth were in action on\r\nthe Wairoa road, along which various blockhouses had been built to\r\ncover the approach to Auckland. One of these works, the Galloway\r\nredoubt, was in charge of Major Lyon, an ex-imperial officer, under\r\nwhose orders some of the battalion were placed. On the 15th of\r\nSeptember the Maoris attacked the redoubt, but were beaten off, after\r\nan affair in which the steadiness of the Royal Irish was conspicuous.\r\nTwo days later Lyon, who had been reinforced by another party of\r\nthe XVIIIth under Lieutenant Russell, took the offensive, and under\r\ncover of darkness led his troops towards Otau, a native village\r\noccupied by local insurgents. It was found to be on the far side of\r\na river, and while Lyon searched for a ford, he engaged the enemy\r\nwith musketry--according to a well-known historian, with unexpectedly\r\nimportant results--\r\n\r\n  “Across the stream at early dawn a detachment of the XVIIIth\r\n  regiment poured concentrated fire upon the _wharés_ [huts]. They\r\n  did not know that within them was a band of Maoris, who had come\r\n  to join the fighting, and who, under the volleys poured upon the\r\n  huts, fell like sheep. The troops, unable to cross the stream,\r\n  withdrew, unconscious of what they had done. Major Lyon, who\r\n  made a circuit by a bridge, found the settlement deserted. ‘The\r\n  _wharés_,’ he said, ‘were riddled with shot, blood in profusion\r\n  both inside and out. They were unmistakably taken by surprise.’\r\n  In after years a Maori who was present told how extensive was the\r\n  slaughter unwittingly inflicted by the XVIIIth, who exercised\r\n  themselves by firing at the huts without knowing how they were\r\n  occupied. As the wounded and dead were carried away before Major\r\n  Lyon reached the spot, he also was ignorant of the severity of\r\n  the blow inflicted.”[198]\r\n\r\nIn October, the battalion were again fortunate enough to rescue\r\na party of New Zealand volunteers from a dangerous situation. An\r\nofficer of the irregulars while reconnoitring a large body of natives\r\nnear his post at Manku, was drawn into an engagement, forced back\r\ninto his stockade, and closely surrounded. The news reached Drury\r\nin the evening, and a strong party of the XVIIIth under Captain\r\nNoblett was at once sent, with some of the 70th, to the relief of the\r\nvolunteers. Pushing on throughout the night the troops early in the\r\nmorning reached Manku, from which the Maoris decamped promptly, thus\r\ndepriving the Royal Irish of the excitement of a skirmish. They at\r\nonce returned to Drury, where they arrived after twenty-two hours’\r\ncontinuous marching. At the end of the month two companies in charge\r\nof Captain Noblett reinforced Ring’s post in the Wairoa country; and\r\nin November an expedition, largely composed of the Royal Irish, was\r\nsent to avenge outrages committed on the settlers in this district.\r\nThe marauders had stockaded themselves in a position surrounded by\r\ndense bush, swamps, and precipitous ravines, but after a skirmish the\r\n_pah_ was captured and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn war opportunities of distinction do not come to every officer, and\r\nsuch in a marked degree was the case in New Zealand, where much good\r\nwork was done by some of the officers of the XVIIIth whose names do\r\nnot appear in General Cameron’s reports. Though the vigorous action\r\nof the troops on the line of communication and in the Wairoa country\r\nprevented the Maoris from raiding Auckland itself, it was impossible\r\nfor Cameron with the small number of men at his disposal to carry\r\nthe war into the enemy’s country, and at the same time protect all\r\nthe outlying farms cleared in the bush by enterprising settlers. In\r\nmost cases the colonists abandoned their farms, sent their women and\r\nchildren to Auckland, and turned themselves into a militia, which\r\nproved a valuable asset in the British force. Occasionally, however,\r\nthe entire population of a settlement held its ground, and required\r\nhelp from the troops. Thus, in September, Captain Kemp[199] with 150\r\nof the Royal Irish was sent to the relief of one of these outposts\r\nof civilisation; a forced march through virgin forest, past many\r\nfarms which the Maoris had looted and burned to the ground, brought\r\nhim to his destination, where he found the colonists had thrown up\r\nstockades round their tiny church, in peaceful times used by various\r\ndenominations as a place of worship, but now turned into the keep\r\nof the primitive fortress. Leaving these brave pioneers a supply\r\nof provisions and cartridges, and a small party of troops to give\r\nbackbone to the defence, he returned to Drury, where his next duty\r\nwas to form a post at a deserted farm on the line of communication.\r\nWith his own company and fifty men under Lieutenant Briggs he cut\r\ndown tree ferns, and with their trunks, lashed together with wild\r\nvines (locally known as supplejack), built a strong palisade, eight\r\nfeet in height, enclosing not only the farm buildings but also\r\nspace enough for the tents of his detachment. As soon as the farm\r\nhad been placed in a state of defence, the British instinct of\r\ncleanliness asserted itself, and the house and outbuildings were\r\nthoroughly cleansed; then parties of men were sent out to “round up”\r\nthe farmer’s cattle which had strayed into the forest, while others\r\nimproved the defences and escorted the convoys to the next post on\r\nthe way to the front. Encouraged by the presence of the detachment\r\nthe farmer returned with his family to his house, which can hardly\r\nbe described as a peaceful home, for, to quote Captain Kemp’s diary,\r\n“Our nights were disturbed by seeing lights in the bush. I burned\r\nall the low scrub (near the farm), and twice a-week took out a\r\nskirmishing party and scoured the forest: we saw a few natives but\r\nthey always escaped us in the thick undergrowth. However we were not\r\nfurther molested.” Kemp’s diary then briefly records a succession of\r\nescorts to convoys and to prisoners taken at the fight of Rangariri;\r\nmuch road-making, and marches knee-deep in swamps.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1864, the Royal Irish were employed in various ways.[200]\r\nPart of the battalion was sent to guard the line of communication\r\nfrom the Queen’s redoubt southward to Ngaruawahia; the remainder\r\nformed the garrisons of the chain of works which Brevet-Colonel Carey\r\nhad established between the Waikato and the estuary of the Thames.\r\nThanks to Captain Kemp, we know something of the hard work done by\r\nthose of the XVIIIth who were in charge of these posts. On the 7th of\r\nJanuary, with two hundred men, he\r\n\r\n  “marched to the Surrey redoubt; it was very hot as we skirted the\r\n  swamps and many men fainted from the heat. We placed a detachment\r\n  in the redoubt, slept in the open outside it, and marched at 5.30\r\n  A.M. next day eight miles to the Esk redoubt on high ground in\r\n  open fern-covered country. Here I left Briggs and a detachment\r\n  and took my company down to the Miranda redoubt, four miles\r\n  farther on, situated at the edge of a steep cliff overlooking\r\n  the estuary of the Thames and defended by a small river on the\r\n  north side. Here I had command of two hundred men, one half being\r\n  Waikato militia. We enlarged the redoubt and made a road down to\r\n  the landing-place (previously all stores were dragged up the face\r\n  of the cliff and the Commissariat suffered heavy losses). We made\r\n  a floating bridge over the small river, sunk a well for drinking\r\n  water, and built a small redoubt on the approach from the south\r\n  in which a strong piquet was posted at night. Boats being unable\r\n  to come in at low water we made a causeway across the mud flats\r\n  to a deep-water landing-place.... We were annoyed at first by\r\n  spies and small parties of the enemy at night, so I sent out\r\n  scouring parties and destroyed their villages, bringing in large\r\n  quantities of beautiful peaches, potatoes, and other vegetables.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, General Cameron had accumulated enough stores\r\nat Ngaruawahia to warrant his advancing farther to the southward.\r\nHe therefore worked up the right bank of the Waipa, building and\r\ngarrisoning redoubts as he advanced, and in a few days reached the\r\nvillage of Te Rore, where for nearly three weeks he was brought to\r\na halt--not by the enemy, but by the eternal difficulty of supply\r\nand transport. Shoals in the rivers made water-carriage uncertain,\r\nand though the crews of the little steamers, the flat-bottomed\r\nrow-boats, and the other craft specially built for the expedition\r\ndid their best, this mode of transport was always liable to break\r\ndown. By land things were no better. In the plain between the Waikato\r\nand Waipa rivers there were hardly any roads, and the native paths,\r\nwinding through forests of tree ferns, were so narrow that men could\r\nonly march in single file. These paths crossed innumerable creeks\r\nrunning in deep watercourses, impassable for guns or waggons till\r\nroads had been cut down the steep banks and bridges thrown over\r\nthe streams. The difficulty of keeping supplied even the small\r\nnumber of men--less than 2500--who were concentrated at Te Rore was\r\nenormous, for though Cameron’s headquarters were only eighty miles\r\nfrom his base at Auckland, every box of “stores had to be shifted\r\ntwelve or fourteen times on account of changes of land and water\r\ncarriage.”[201] To relieve this strain Cameron cut a road through the\r\nbush to Raglan, a port twenty miles distant on the west coast, and\r\nthus gained a second or subsidiary base, but as a set-off to this\r\nadvantage a considerable number of men were necessarily withdrawn\r\nfrom active operations to guard the new line of communication.\r\n\r\nWhile the advance depôt at Te Rore was being gradually filled up, the\r\nMaoris threw up a formidable chain of works to bar farther advance\r\ninto their country; but after a few skirmishes they were manœuvred\r\nfrom these positions and disappeared into the mountains in the centre\r\nof the island. To prevent their return down the Waikato river, a\r\npost was formed on its left bank at Pukerima, and manned by the\r\nheadquarter companies of the XVIIIth from Ngaruawahia. The stay of\r\nthe battalion at the Maori capital had been uneventful, though to\r\ncelebrate the temporary reunion of most of the companies pony races\r\nand sports for the men were organised, and made a welcome break in\r\nthe monotony of the campaign, for in the long intervals between\r\nactive operations amusements for all ranks were not to be obtained.\r\nAn officer writes: “There were very few opportunities during the war\r\nfor gymkhanas and that sort of thing, and a ‘sing-song’ over the\r\ncamp-fire was as much as could be attempted. Occasionally a little\r\nduck-shooting from canoes was obtainable if we were stationed near a\r\nriver, or more rarely a raid on the semi-wild boar sometimes to be\r\nmet with in the bush. Pigeon-shooting was sometimes to be had, but\r\nthis was about all.”\r\n\r\nNot all the companies went with headquarters to the new post;\r\nsome held the works on the lower reaches of the river, and a\r\ndetachment of four companies under Captain Ring was at Te Awamutu,\r\nwhere Colonel Carey, recently promoted to be Brigadier-General\r\nand second-in-command of the forces in New Zealand, was throwing\r\nup strong redoubts. Here everything appeared to be quiet until a\r\nscouting party of colonists discovered that a number of Maoris had\r\nslipped back to the Waikato plain, and were vigorously entrenching\r\nthemselves a few miles off near the native village of Orakau.\r\nCarey at once reconnoitred the _pah_, and decided to move on the\r\nenemy’s position during the night; the main column was to advance on\r\nOrakau,[202] while smaller parties were to place themselves by forced\r\nmarches on the enemy’s flank and rear. Like a good soldier, Carey\r\ndid not issue his orders till the last moment, and it was not till\r\nafter dark on the 30th of March that the officers of the detachment\r\nof the XVIIIth heard the news, which reached them in a very dramatic\r\nmanner. They were sitting at mess in a native hut, dimly lighted by\r\na few camp lanterns, when the voice of a staff officer was heard\r\ncalling for Ring, who in a few minutes returned, looking pale and\r\ndepressed. Waiting until the soldier servants had left the hut to\r\nreply to his comrades’ inquiries as to the cause of his sudden gloom,\r\nhe explained that the detachment was to march that night to attack\r\nthe _pah_, and he added in confidence that he had a presentiment that\r\nhis last hour was close at hand. “I have taken part in many affairs\r\nof this kind,” he said, “but I have never felt as I do now.” When his\r\nfriends “chaffed” him and tried to cheer him up, he answered, “Oh!\r\nnever fear. I’ll do my duty.” After issuing the necessary orders to\r\nthe detachment he wrote his farewell letters, hastily put his affairs\r\nin order, and then marched off with the advance-guard, which he had\r\nthe honour on this occasion to command.\r\n\r\nThe column reached Orakau at dawn on March 31. The Maoris, though\r\nevidently taken by surprise, opened fire on the advance-guard,\r\ncomposed of 120 Royal Irish and a party of 20 men of an irregular\r\ncorps, known as the Forest Rangers. Ring extended his men into\r\nskirmishing order, and, supported by a company of the 40th, led\r\nthem to the attack. The position, which apparently had not been\r\nreconnoitred adequately, proved very formidable. On a swelling down\r\nthe Maoris had thrown up an “earthwork with good flank defences, deep\r\nditches, with posts and rails outside, and nearly covered from view\r\nby flax-bushes, peach-trees, and high fern.”[203] Though repulsed by\r\nthe fire of their unseen enemies Ring’s men re-formed quickly, and\r\nreinforced by a second company of the 40th, made another but equally\r\nfutile effort to storm the works, being again beaten back with the\r\nloss of several officers and men, among whom was Brevet-Major Ring,\r\nmortally wounded. When Captain Baker, XVIIIth, D.A.A.G., saw that\r\nRing was down, he flung himself off his horse, and calling for\r\nvolunteers led a third assault. This failed also, but though these\r\nthree attacks were unsuccessful, they served their purpose by so\r\ncompletely occupying the attention of the enemy that he did not\r\nrealise that the British troops were hemming him in on every side;\r\nand though the cordon was at first but slender it sufficed to prevent\r\nreinforcements from throwing themselves into the _pah_. At midday\r\na large party of Maoris tried to break through our lines from the\r\noutside, but a few shells and the musketry of the outposts kept\r\nthem at a respectful distance, unable to do more than excite their\r\nbesieged comrades to further resistance by shouts and war dances.\r\nAs soon as the detached columns detailed to surround the _pah_ were\r\nin their places, Carey began to sap up to the works, covering his\r\nmovements with artillery fire. In defending themselves against this\r\nbombardment the Maoris showed great resource. “Long bundles of fern\r\nwere cut and bound with strips of green flax until an enormous mass\r\nof yielding fern received the harmless cannon-balls and guarded the\r\nearthworks.”[204]\r\n\r\nThroughout the afternoon and night the besieged kept up a heavy\r\nfire upon the troops, who “dug themselves in” so effectually with\r\ntheir bayonets that the casualties were few. The sap was pushed on\r\nvigorously, and on the 1st of April various small reinforcements,\r\nsnatched up from the line of communication, reached Carey. Among\r\nthem was a party of the XVIIIth under Captain Inman, composed of 1\r\ncaptain, 2 subalterns, 8 sergeants, 2 drummers, and 110 rank and\r\nfile, and 70 officers and men of the 70th; after marching all night,\r\nthey were sent at once into the trenches and rifle-pits with which\r\nthe _pah_ was being rapidly encircled. Though the enemy kept up a\r\nheavy fire upon the men digging in the sap, the work went on without\r\nintermission until the morning of the 2nd, when Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHavelock brought into camp a quantity of hand-grenades, which\r\na brave artilleryman, at the risk of his life, hurled into the\r\nenemy’s rifle-pits. Under cover of the confusion produced by these\r\nmissiles Carey ran into the sap a 6-pr. Armstrong gun, whose fire\r\nbreached the palisades, and beat down the musketry directed upon\r\nthe working-parties. The situation had improved so much that he was\r\npreparing to assault, when General Cameron ordered him to stay his\r\nhand. The General had recently arrived on the scene, but not wishing\r\nto deprive Carey of his command announced that he was present as\r\na spectator only; learning, however, that many women and children\r\nwere in the _pah_, he desired that the garrison should be given the\r\nchance to surrender before the attack was pressed home. The condition\r\nof the Maoris was now desperate. When surprised by our sudden swoop\r\non Orakau, they had little or no water in the _pah_; our line of\r\noutposts and rifle-pits proved impenetrable to the parties who sought\r\nfor water in the night; their only food was raw potatoes; their\r\nlosses in fighting men had been considerable, and their supply of\r\nbullets was almost exhausted. Yet they disdained to yield, and when\r\nan interpreter addressed them, saying, “Hear the word of the General:\r\nyou have done enough to show that you are brave men; your case is\r\nhopeless; surrender, and your lives will be spared;” they haughtily\r\nreplied, “This is the word of the Maori: we will fight for ever and\r\never and ever.” They were then invited to send away the women, and\r\nanswered, “The women will fight as well as we.”\r\n\r\nAfter this abortive negotiation fire was reopened on both sides, and\r\nsome of the troops appear to have lost their heads and attempted\r\nto storm the _pah_ without orders.[205] One of these unauthorised\r\nassaults was led by a soldier in the XVIIIth, Private Hannon, who,\r\nthrowing his forage cap over a partially breached spot in the\r\ndefences, dashed after it with some twenty men, for the most part\r\nbelonging to New Zealand corps. After clambering over a stout fence\r\nthey dropped into a ditch, where Hannon and nine other brave men\r\nwere mown down by a volley fired at point-blank range. But though a\r\nsimilar attack by a party of regulars and volunteers also failed to\r\ncarry another weak spot in the fortifications, every hour saw the\r\nMaoris less able to face the storm of grape-shot, hand-grenades,\r\nand rifle-bullets poured upon them on every side. Suddenly Rewi,\r\ntheir war chief, decided to cut his way out or to perish in the\r\nattempt. While his followers mustered among the huts round which\r\ntheir works were built, they sang one of the hymns taught them by the\r\nmissionaries, and then, remembering the old days before white men had\r\nsettled in New Zealand, chanted invocations to their ancient gods.\r\n\r\n  “Their voices,” says Rusden, “were heard by the wondering\r\n  English, who were to marvel still more at their daring. At the\r\n  rear a double line of the investing troops had been thrown back\r\n  under cover to enable a gun to open fire. Through that opening,\r\n  about four o’clock in the broad day, chanting their appeal to the\r\n  God of battles and moving steadily as in scorn of their foes,\r\n  the Maoris marched towards the narrow neck of swamp between\r\n  the ridge and mound. Carey (in his official report) said they\r\n  rushed. Mr Fox writes that an eye-witness told him ‘they were in\r\n  a great column, the women, the children, and the great chiefs in\r\n  the centre, and they marched out as cool and steady as if they\r\n  had been going to Church.’ Rewi ordered that no shot should be\r\n  fired. The little ammunition left was needed for defence in the\r\n  desperate course through the swamp.... Some accounts state that\r\n  as if to deceive the troops and gain time for the fugitives, a\r\n  Maori, while his countrymen departed, sprang up with a white\r\n  flag on the parapet and was riddled by bullets. One chief, more\r\n  successful, diverted the English for a few moments; he walked\r\n  coolly towards the troops and surrendered.”[206]\r\n\r\nThe regiment (not the XVIIIth) charged with the defence of the ground\r\nacross which the Maori column was moving, was disposed in two lines,\r\nthe foremost lying under a bank which, while it covered the men from\r\nfire from the _pah_, prevented their watching the ground in front\r\nof them. The Maoris marched towards this bank, and, incredible as\r\nit seems, passed through these two lines of British regular troops,\r\napparently without opposition. It was rumoured at the time that\r\nbefore the men in the first line discovered that the natives were out\r\nof their trenches, the Maoris had actually jumped over their heads\r\nand were well on their way towards the second line! Thanks to the\r\nenergy of the General and his staff and the zeal of the remainder of\r\nthe troops, the natives did not escape in a body, but were headed off\r\nby a handful of mounted men, who punished them severely in a pursuit\r\nwhich lasted until nightfall. Thirty-three prisoners fell into our\r\nhands; more than a hundred bodies were found on the field; it was\r\nknown that at least twenty men had been buried in the _pah_, while\r\ntraces in the bush proved that a considerable number of killed and\r\nwounded had been carried away after the troops had been recalled to\r\ncamp. The natives themselves acknowledged to a loss of two hundred,\r\nout of a strength considered by General Cameron not to exceed three\r\nhundred fighting men. Well might the British General in his despatch\r\nsay that it was impossible not to admire the heroic courage and\r\ndevotion of the Maoris in defending themselves so long against\r\noverwhelming numbers.[207]\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Irish were let loose, the men were wild to avenge the\r\ndeath of Captain Ring, who was deservedly respected and admired by\r\nall ranks in the regiment. Though the officers did all they could to\r\nprevent unnecessary slaughter, more than one Maori was slain in the\r\nbelief that it was he who had fired the shot which laid Ring low.\r\nWhen a fugitive was overtaken the cry arose, “That’s the man that\r\nkilled the Captain!”--then came a wild yell, a bayonet thrust, and\r\nall was over. Not all the XVIIIth, however, were believers in such\r\nstern methods: two instances of clemency are recorded, one of which\r\nunhappily ended fatally to the poor Irishman. A soldier overtook and\r\nseized a Maori and spared his life; the prisoner was lying on the\r\nground exhausted and apparently harmless, and his captor had turned\r\naway for a moment, when the native seized a rifle and shot him dead.\r\nThe savage’s triumph was short-lived, however, for other men of the\r\nXVIIIth were on the spot and silenced him for ever. In the other case\r\nthere was no such tragedy. Early in the pursuit a Maori was taken\r\nprisoner and placed in the charge of two privates, who, as they heard\r\nthe shouts of their comrades dying away in the distance, cursed their\r\nbad luck in being obliged to remain behind. An officer came up when\r\ntheir impatience reached its climax, and overheard this conversation.\r\n“Shall we kill him, Barney?” Barney thought for a moment, and then\r\nshook his head. “I couldn’t kill the craytur in cold blood, Pat, but\r\nI wish we were quit of him.” “Kick him and let him go,” was the ready\r\nresponse. No sooner said than done; the prisoner disappeared into the\r\nbush, while Pat and Barney hurried after the regiment!\r\n\r\nThe British losses were sixteen killed and fifty-two wounded. The\r\ncasualties among the Royal Irish were one officer (Brevet-Major\r\nRing) and eight of the other ranks killed or mortally wounded, nine\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men wounded.[208] In his official\r\nreport Brigadier-General Carey, after expressing his deep regret at\r\nthe death of Brevet-Major Ring, brought the services of Captain Inman\r\nto the notice of the General Officer commanding in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Orakau the enemy retired again into the\r\nmountains, whither Cameron did not deem it prudent to follow him;\r\nand when the disaffected tribes in other parts of the North island\r\nheard how inconclusively the campaign on the Waikato had ended, there\r\nwas an insurrection in the east, chiefly memorable for our defeat at\r\nthe Gate _pah_, while in the south-west (the Taranaki country) there\r\nwere frequent skirmishes between the troops and hostile natives.[209]\r\nTo neither of these scenes of action were the Royal Irish summoned;\r\nafter occupying Ngaruawahia for three months the regiment marched to\r\nOtahuhu camp, where it formed part of the garrison of Auckland during\r\nthe remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1865, the Royal Irish were sent to the\r\nsouth-west coast of the North island, to reinforce the small number\r\nof regular troops holding the Taranaki (or New Plymouth) district,\r\nwhere since the war began the British had been able to do little\r\nmore than to hold redoubts round a few settlements, and to send\r\noccasional punitive expeditions into the enemy’s country. In the\r\nbeginning of the campaign the rebel tribes, the adherents of the\r\nKing, had fought us solely on political grounds; they objected to\r\nour presence and wished to drive us out of New Zealand, but no\r\nquestion of religion entered into the quarrel. Many of the Maoris\r\nhad embraced Christianity, and had become such strict Sabbatarians\r\nthat on one occasion the garrison of a besieged _pah_ left their\r\nworks on a Sunday morning to attend chapel, with results disastrous\r\nto themselves. But early in 1864, the British learned that a set\r\nof fanatics had arisen, named Hau-Haus, whose tenets, appealing to\r\nall that was worst in the Maori character, were a weird mixture\r\nof cannibalism, paganism, and Christianity.[210] In April 1864,\r\na detachment of the 57th was badly cut up near New Plymouth; an\r\nofficer, Captain Lloyd, and six men were killed by the Hau-Haus,\r\nwho cut off their heads and drank their blood. A few days later,\r\naccording to the native accounts, the Angel Gabriel appeared and\r\nordered Lloyd’s head to be exhumed and carried throughout New\r\nZealand, to serve as the medium of Jehovah’s communication with\r\nman. As soon as the head was disinterred it appointed priests, and\r\nannounced that thanks to the protection of Gabriel and his angels\r\nthe followers of the new religion would be invulnerable: the Virgin\r\nMary would be constantly present with them: the religion of England\r\nwas false and its scriptures must be burned; men and women were to\r\nlive together promiscuously; the priests would obtain victories by\r\nshouting the word “Hau,”[211] and could invoke the help of legions of\r\nangels for the extermination of the whites. As soon as New Zealand\r\nhad rid itself of the English, men would arrive from heaven to\r\nteach the Maoris all the arts and sciences known to Europeans. This\r\nextraordinary creed is believed to have been evolved by educated and\r\nunscrupulous natives, who realised that the Maoris had been shaken in\r\ntheir allegiance to the “King movement” by the result of the Waikato\r\ncampaign, and that a stronger bond of union was required than a\r\npurely political organisation, the fortunes of which were not then in\r\nthe ascendant.\r\n\r\nThough in several affairs with the 57th the Hau-Haus learned by\r\nbitter experience that they were by no means invulnerable to Enfield\r\nbullets, the new religion found many converts. The tribes in the\r\nsouth-west of the North island had always been turbulent and hostile.\r\nThey had committed grave and unprovoked outrages, such as the murder\r\nof a party of soldiers in 1863, which heralded the outbreak of the\r\nwar. They were now in a state of open hostility, and almost the only\r\npart of the district which acknowledged the Queen’s rule was the\r\nground enclosed by the redoubts round the settlements of Taranaki and\r\nWanganui. The Government of New Zealand decided that there could be\r\nno peace until the tribesmen had been chastised, their power broken,\r\nand their country opened up. To accomplish these objects General\r\nCameron had about five thousand troops, a thousand white volunteers,\r\nand a thousand native auxiliaries. His plan of campaign was that two\r\ncolumns, one based on Taranaki, the other on Wanganui, should force\r\ntheir way along the coast until they joined hands on the road between\r\nthese two settlements.\r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1865, a detachment of seven companies (about 500 of\r\nall ranks) of the Royal Irish, under Major J. H. Rocke, embarked for\r\nWanganui in H.M.S. _Falcon_ and _Eclipse_, the remainder of the\r\nbattalion being left under Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman at Otahuhu\r\ncamp. On the voyage the _Eclipse_ ran ashore on a sandbank, but the\r\nsoldiers were transhipped to another vessel, and on reaching their\r\ndestination took their place in a column commanded by Colonel Waddy,\r\n50th, consisting of the Royal Irish; 50th; detachments of Royal\r\nArtillery and Royal Engineers, and a small party of extemporised\r\ncavalry, in all 963 officers and men. On January 24, Waddy moved\r\nup the coast towards the Waitotara river. The route first led past\r\nsettlers’ farms, well-planted and rich in clover-fields, and then\r\nskirted native villages, deserted by the Maoris, who had left their\r\npeach-groves and patches of tobacco, Indian corn, and water-melons\r\nto the mercy of the troops. Next came a weary stretch of steep\r\nsandhills, and it was late in the afternoon when Waddy halted near\r\na lake close to the Maori village of Nukumaru. During the march\r\nno enemies had shown themselves, and from Colonel Waddy’s report\r\nit appears that the camp was formed before the outposts were in\r\nposition. When the tents were pitched piquets were sent out; among\r\nthem was a party of the Royal Irish, under Captain Hugh Shaw, with\r\norders to take up ground half a mile to the north of the camp. Shaw\r\nmoved off in skirmishing order and cautiously approached a patch\r\nof bush close to the village, which it was necessary to occupy. It\r\nwas not until he was within thirty yards of this bush that a large\r\nnumber of Maoris, lurking in the thicket, disclosed their presence by\r\na heavy fire. Though surprised, Shaw kept his head, and remembering\r\nthat he had just passed a small ditch with a fence in front of it,\r\nrallied his party behind this meagre cover, which was but sixty yards\r\nfrom the Maoris’ position. As soon as he had set his rifles to work\r\nhe counted his men, and found that one was missing, lying hard hit\r\nhalf-way between the piquet and the natives in the bush. Shaw was in\r\na dilemma. To leave the man where he was would condemn him to certain\r\ndeath, for at nightfall he would inevitably be tomahawked by the\r\nMaoris: to order a few of the piquet to bring him in was to expose\r\nthe rescue party to very great danger, nor did Shaw wish to send men\r\non a forlorn hope unless he himself led them. Yet, if he did head a\r\nrescue party, he was technically abandoning his post, and, during\r\nhis absence, throwing upon his subordinates the responsibility not\r\nonly for the lives of the piquet but for the safety of the whole\r\ncamp. Shaw decided to face this risk--a very grave one, as the events\r\nof the next day proved--and called for volunteers to help him save\r\nthe wounded man. Four private soldiers, Brandon, Brien, Kearnes,\r\nand Clampitt sprang to their feet and dashed headlong after their\r\nofficer. In a few moments these five gallant men were bending over\r\ntheir comrade, whom they found still living. The air around them\r\nseemed alive with bullets, for the piquet was firing viciously at the\r\npuffs of smoke which marked the lairs of the Maori sharpshooters,\r\nwhile the enemy concentrated his musketry upon the rescuers. There\r\nwas no time to consult how best to move the wounded man: Shaw caused\r\nhim to be hoisted upon his own back, and, staggering under the\r\nweight, carried him back in triumph to the piquet. Incredible as it\r\nmay seem, neither Shaw nor any of his companions were hit in this\r\nadventure. Shaw was awarded the Victoria Cross, while privates James\r\nKearnes, George Clampitt, and John Brandon were presented with the\r\nsilver medal for distinguished conduct in the field.[212]\r\n\r\nThe sound of the firing brought up Major Rocke with a hundred men\r\nof the battalion, and thanks to this reinforcement the piquet was\r\nable to maintain so hot a fusilade that the enemy did not attempt\r\neither to surround, or to close in upon them. For some hours the\r\nfire-fight raged, the natives returning shot for shot; then the\r\nmusketry died down, and the Maoris stole away to the shelter of a\r\nneighbouring _pah_. Early on the morning of the 25th, the piquet was\r\nrelieved by Captain Noblett with seventy-five of his own men, and\r\ntwenty-five of the 50th regiment. On the right he posted his party\r\nof the XVIIIth near the village, while on the left his detachment of\r\nthe 50th watched a deep watercourse, with banks covered by a thick\r\ngrowth of wild flax. On the far side of this watercourse was another\r\npiquet, also of the 50th, but not under Noblett’s command. During the\r\nforenoon not an enemy was seen; the bush seemed absolutely deserted,\r\nbut it was the lull before the storm. In the middle of the day the\r\nMaoris suddenly abandoned their traditional policy of standing on\r\nthe defensive in carefully fortified positions, and two columns, in\r\nall about 600 men, falling simultaneously on the flanks of Noblett’s\r\npiquet swept it before them, and pushed forward so vigorously\r\nthrough the breach thus made in the outpost line that for a time the\r\nsafety of the camp was seriously imperilled. From the scanty details\r\npreserved of this interesting fight it appears that about two P.M.\r\nCaptain Noblett heard firing on his left, where Enfield bullets\r\nwere falling among his detachment of the 50th. On hurrying to the\r\npoint of danger, he discovered that these badly directed bullets\r\ncame from the far side of the watercourse, where the distant piquet\r\nof the 50th was trying to stem a Maori rush. After making necessary\r\ndispositions he ran back to the right of his ground, to find that\r\nthere also the natives were attacking in strength; they had set fire\r\nto the bush, and under cover of the smoke were pushing fast through\r\nthe village, and driving the piquet of the XVIIIth backwards towards\r\nthe camp. When the alarm was given all the troops not on outpost\r\nfell in and hurried up to the front. The first party ready to move\r\nwas Captain Daubeny’s company of the XVIIIth; in a short time they\r\nmet Captain Noblett’s piquet in full retreat; Noblett rallied his\r\nmen upon the reinforcement, and then the two detachments, extending\r\ninto skirmishing order, by their steady front and well-sustained\r\nfire effectively checked the enemy. Elsewhere, however, things did\r\nnot go so well, and the natives were almost in the camp before the\r\ncombined effect of a charge of mounted men and the shells of 6-pr.\r\nArmstrong guns drove them back into the bush. In their retreat the\r\nMaoris abandoned twenty-two killed and two wounded, and succeeded\r\nin carrying away about seventy dead or injured warriors. In the two\r\ndays’ fighting the British casualties were--officers, one killed and\r\ntwo wounded; other ranks, fifteen killed and thirty wounded. The\r\nlosses of the XVIIIth were three private soldiers killed and twelve\r\nwounded, one mortally.[213] The General in his report favourably\r\nmentioned the names of Major Rocke, Captain Shaw, and Captain Dawson.\r\n\r\nAfter this repulse the Maoris retired to a _pah_ close by at Wereroa,\r\na position which they deemed impregnable. This opinion General\r\nCameron appeared to share, for he did not attack, but, hoping to\r\nentice the enemy out of his works, moved slowly up the coast. At the\r\nmouth of the Waitotara river Major Rocke and four companies of the\r\nRoyal Irish were left to guard a bridge of casks, while the remainder\r\nof the battalion, recently joined by the three headquarter companies\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman, marched with the rest of the column\r\nto Patea. Here they remained for many months in charge of a line of\r\nposts on the road between Wanganui and Taranaki, sharing in only one\r\nof the few operations which took place in this part of the country in\r\n1865.[214]\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in New Zealand at this time was very\r\nunfortunate. General Cameron, who commanded the Queen’s troops, was\r\nat daggers drawn with Sir George Grey, the Governor of the colony.\r\nThe New Zealand ministry was wrangling fiercely with the Cabinet at\r\nhome, for at the very time that Cameron announced he could not carry\r\nout Grey’s policy without considerable reinforcements of regular\r\ntroops, the Colonial Office intimated that the War Office was about\r\nto withdraw five battalions from New Zealand.[215] The General\r\nwas already worn out by physical fatigue and mental anxiety: the\r\nthreatened withdrawal of the troops was the last straw on the camel’s\r\nback; on the ground of ill-health Cameron asked to be relieved of his\r\ncommand, and in August, 1865, was succeeded by Major-General Trevor\r\nChute. About a month before the new Commander-in-Chief arrived, Sir\r\nGeorge Grey, who had in vain urged Cameron to attack the _pah_ at\r\nWereroa, remembered that before entering the service of the Colonial\r\nOffice he had been a captain in the army, and determined to prove\r\nto the Maoris that their vaunted stronghold was not impregnable. On\r\nthe morning of July 20, he assembled a small column, consisting of\r\na hundred of the 14th regiment, an equal number of the Royal Irish\r\nunder Captain Noblett, and about four hundred and seventy colonists\r\nand friendly natives. In his plan of attack Grey allotted a duty to\r\nthe regular troops which required great discipline and steadiness:\r\nthey were to demonstrate, and threaten an attack upon the front, the\r\nbest defended face of the fortification, while the colonists and\r\n“friendlies,” by a long and circuitous march, established themselves\r\non ground from which the rear of the Maori works could be commanded.\r\nThe two hundred regular troops pitched their tents well within view\r\nof the natives, threw out posts, marched and counter-marched, and\r\nsuccessfully “bluffed” the enemy into the belief that a large body of\r\nsoldiers were preparing for an assault. The irregulars succeeded in\r\nplacing themselves unseen in rear of the _pah_; there was some work\r\nwith the rifle, and then the Maoris, seized with panic, swarmed down\r\na steep cliff and abandoned their fortress, almost without firing a\r\nshot in its defence. A reinforcement of fifty of the XVIIIth were\r\nbrought up from the line of communication by Major Rocke, who was now\r\nin command of the regiment,[216] but they took no part in the affair.\r\nThe enemy lost fifty men and many stores: in Sir George Grey’s column\r\nthere appear to have been no casualties.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the year 1865 the headquarters of the battalion\r\nremained at Patea, with detachments along the coast. In December,\r\nGeneral Chute was directed by the Governor to prepare an expedition\r\nagainst the Hau-Haus who infested the country between Taranaki and\r\nWanganui. He drew a hundred officers and men under Major Rocke\r\nfrom the posts held by the Royal Irish; 139 of all ranks from the\r\n14th regiment; about 100 from the 50th, and with 45 of the Forest\r\nRangers and 300 native auxiliaries, took the field at the beginning\r\nof January, 1866. After making himself master of the strongly\r\npalisaded village of Otahuhu,[217] he led his column on a more\r\ndifficult enterprise, the capture of the Putahi _pah_, which stood\r\nin a clearing on the top of a hill, 500 feet in height, with sides\r\nrough with spurs, seamed in every direction by watercourses, and\r\ncovered with dense jungle. Only one path led from the plain to the\r\nsummit through this labyrinth, difficult in itself and rendered\r\nalmost impassable by the stockades and other defences with which\r\nit was known to bristle. Chute decided to avoid this death-trap by\r\nattacking the _pah_ from the rear. Long before dawn on the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1866, his troops had begun a march, which in his despatch\r\nhe described as “one continued struggle through a dense primeval\r\nforest and bush, over ravines and gullies which could in most cases\r\nonly be ascended and descended by the aid of supple jack, and then\r\nonly with great difficulty. The distance to be traversed could not\r\nhave exceeded four miles, but the obstacles and obstructions opposed\r\nto us made it a severe task for four hours.” General Chute’s method\r\nof attacking the Maori works was rough but effective. “There was\r\nusually,” writes General Alexander, “an open plateau in front of the\r\n_pahs_; he brought his men there to the edge of the bush, and when\r\nhis line and supports and natives in reserve were all ready he made\r\nhis bugler sound a single G; the men advanced from under cover, and\r\non the double G being given a rush was made at the _pah_, hatchets\r\nwere drawn from the belts of the men, the withes of the outer fence\r\nwere suddenly cut, the palisading broken through, and the _pah_\r\nstormed with cheering in the smoke.” Such was his plan at the capture\r\nof Putahi. As soon as the Forest Rangers reached the plateau they\r\nopened out into skirmishing order, lying down within 400 yards of the\r\nenemy to cover the formation of the remainder of the troops, who as\r\nthey emerged gradually from the bush were extended--the detachment of\r\nthe XVIIIth on the right, the 14th in the centre, and the 50th on the\r\nleft, with the native contingent in reserve. It was more than an hour\r\nbefore the soldiers at the rear of the column, breathless from their\r\nexertions in scaling precipices, had found their places in the ranks.\r\nDuring that time the Hau-Hau garrison, about two hundred strong, had\r\nfirst performed a war dance to keep up their spirits, and then fired,\r\nbut with little effect, upon the troops. When Chute’s line was in\r\norder he gave the word to advance. Under a heavy but almost harmless\r\nfusilade the soldiers moved forward, as steadily as on an ordinary\r\nparade; when they were within eighty yards of the enemy the double\r\nG was sounded; they charged and burst into the _pah_, driving the\r\nenemy before them headlong into the bush. A general pursuit followed,\r\nin which the Hau-Haus are said to have lost considerably; then the\r\ntroops were called off; the _pah_ was destroyed and the column\r\nmarched back to camp. In this affair the British casualties were two\r\nmen killed and ten wounded, none of them belonging to the XVIIIth.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next few days General Chute captured several\r\nmore of the Hau-Hau strongholds, and wound up his punitive expedition\r\nby marching round the east of Mount Egmont to Taranaki, by a\r\ntrack believed to be impracticable for civilised troops. In these\r\nsuccesses, however, the XVIIIth had no share, for Rocke’s party was\r\nordered back to Patea the day after the Putahi _pah_ was captured.\r\nWith Chute’s march the war, as far as most of the regular army\r\nwas concerned, came to an end. The British Government decided that\r\nthe Imperial forces should no longer be actively employed, as it\r\nconsidered that the Maoris had been sufficiently weakened for the\r\ncolonists to finish the struggle without further help from the mother\r\ncountry.[218] Nearly all the troops were accordingly withdrawn from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Wanganui; the Royal Irish, however, remained\r\nin their old posts in the Patea-Wanganui district, which continued\r\nto be much harassed by rebellious tribes. Communication along\r\nthe coast road was interrupted; small parties of colonists were\r\nfrequently surprised and murdered; and the local forces were twice\r\nrudely handled in operations in the bush. Occasionally the garrisons\r\nof the posts made sorties against the insurgents, but nothing of\r\nimportance occurred until October, 1866, when the Governor arrived\r\nat Patea and called upon Major Rocke for the help of his regiment\r\nin quelling disturbances in the country round Wanganui. Major Rocke\r\nwas in the happy position of being his own commanding-officer,\r\nwith no senior present to whom the question had to be referred.\r\nHe joyfully responded to Sir George Grey’s appeal by organising a\r\nmobile column of three hundred Royal Irish and an equal number of\r\nNew Zealand militia, and led the combined force to Waingongoro,\r\nwhere the Governor at an interview with the rebel leaders failed to\r\npersuade them to lay down their arms. Sir George Grey at once moved\r\ntowards Papoia, a native village buried in the heart of the forest,\r\nbelieved to be strongly fortified, and known to be approachable only\r\nby difficult paths. He determined to surprise this village by an\r\nattack at dawn, and Rocke accordingly paraded his men at midnight on\r\nthe 17th-18th of October. The Royal Irish led the march, preceded\r\nby a storming party under Lieutenant Pringle, who had volunteered\r\nfor this dangerous duty. Silently, and with every precaution to\r\navoid giving the alarm to their watchful enemy, the Royal Irish\r\nslowly followed the friendly natives who guided them along a steep\r\nand narrow track. At daybreak the men at the head of the column\r\nnoticed that the path was leading into a glen, and a few minutes\r\nlater discovered that across this glen the Hau-Haus had thrown a\r\nhuge barricade, nine feet in height, made of the trunks of trees\r\nand crowned with a stiff “post and rails” fence. At this moment a\r\nnumber of natives, hidden in the bush, opened a heavy fire upon the\r\nstorming party, but Pringle disregarded this flank attack, and with\r\nhis men rushed at the barricade, breached it with axes, and drove the\r\ndefenders into the bush. The rest of the column poured through the\r\ngap and swarmed into the village, which the Maoris hastily abandoned,\r\nleaving several dead behind them. This success, obtained without loss\r\nto the XVIIIth, was quickly followed up by Rocke, who, making his\r\nway across country hitherto believed to be impassable to Europeans,\r\nraided several hostile villages, which the Hau-Haus, cowed by the\r\ncapture of Papoia, abandoned without resistance. At the conclusion\r\nof this three weeks’ campaign, the gallantry of Lieutenant Pringle\r\nin his charge on the barricade was brought to the notice of the\r\nofficer commanding the troops in New Zealand; and two of the men who\r\naccompanied him, privates Acton and Hennigan, were awarded the medal\r\nfor distinguished conduct in the field.[219] It may here be mentioned\r\nthat although this affair was the last in which regular soldiers took\r\npart, it was not until 1869 that the issue of a medal for the New\r\nZealand war was sanctioned, while not until 1870 was leave given to\r\nthe regiments which had been engaged in the war to add the words “New\r\nZealand” to the battle honours on their Colours. For their services\r\nBrevet-Colonel G. J. Carey and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Sir H. M.\r\nHavelock, Bart., V.C., were created Companions of the Order of the\r\nBath; Major J. H. Rocke received a Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonelcy; and\r\nCaptains J. Inman and T. D. Baker were promoted to Brevet-Majorities.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the Royal Irish were engaged in active operations\r\nagainst the Maoris their casualties were--\r\n\r\n_Officers_--\r\n\r\n  Died of wounds,                   Brevet-Major J. T. Ring.\r\n  Died from accident or disease,    Lieutenants F. P. Leonard and\r\n                                        O. R. Lawson.\r\n                                    Ensign G. B. Jenkins.\r\n\r\n_Other ranks_--\r\n\r\n  Killed or died of wounds, 17; died from accident or disease, 39;\r\n  wounded, 36.[220]\r\n\r\nUntil March 1867, the regiment continued to hold the line of posts\r\nbetween Patea and Wanganui; then the condition of the country\r\nwarranted the concentration of the Royal Irish at the latter\r\nplace, where they remained till December, when headquarters and\r\nsix companies were sent to Auckland, with two detachments, each\r\nof two companies, at Napier and Taranaki. When the headquarter\r\ncompanies reached Auckland the command of the battalion was assumed\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel G. A. Elliot, who had arrived from England on\r\npromotion from the first battalion, _vice_ Colonel Chapman, retired\r\non half-pay. At this time the effective strength of the battalion was\r\n861, all told.[221]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 7.\r\n\r\n  Sketch Map\r\n  of part of the\r\n  NORTH ISLAND\r\n  of\r\n  NEW ZEALAND\r\n  1863-67\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nThere is little of interest to chronicle in the doings of the\r\nbattalion during the year 1868. The headquarters remained at\r\nAuckland, with detachments in various parts of the colony. The\r\narmament of the Royal Irish was modernised by the issue of Snider\r\nbreech-loading rifles to replace the muzzle-loading Enfields with\r\nwhich the men had hitherto been provided. In December Colonel\r\nBeatson, the officer who for a year and a half had commanded the\r\ntroops in New Zealand, left the colony; before sailing he issued\r\nfarewell orders in which he expressed his “unqualified satisfaction\r\nwith the correct and soldierly conduct of the 2nd battalion,\r\nXVIIIth Royal Irish regiment, which reflects credit not only on\r\nthemselves alone but also on the British army of which they are\r\nnow almost the only representatives in this distant colony.” Early\r\nin 1869, the battalion was warned to be in readiness to relieve\r\nthe 50th in Australia. The European population, however, strongly\r\nopposed the departure of the Royal Irish: officers and men were\r\nalike popular with all classes of society, and while on personal\r\ngrounds the colonists wished to retain the regiment among them,\r\nfrom the political point of view they deprecated the withdrawal of\r\nthe XVIIIth, who were the rear-guard of the British army in New\r\nZealand. As a concession the Ministry at home reluctantly postponed\r\nthe departure of the battalion, but after a few months again ordered\r\nit to Australia. The Government of New Zealand remonstrated warmly\r\nagainst this decision, and offered to guarantee for five years any\r\nannual payment which the War Office might fix as the price of the\r\nretention of the XVIIIth. But as the Imperial Government had decided\r\nto throw upon the settlers the responsibility for the defence of\r\nthe colony, it decided that no regular troops should remain in New\r\nZealand, and at the beginning of 1870 the battalion embarked, the\r\nheadquarters and four companies for Sydney, and detachments of two\r\ncompanies each for Melbourne, Adelaide, and Hobart.\r\n\r\nHow highly the Royal Irish were appreciated in New Zealand will be\r\nseen by the following extracts from official documents, newspaper\r\narticles, and farewell speeches on the subject of their departure.\r\nSir George Bowen, who succeeded Sir George Grey as Governor of the\r\ncolony, recorded his “sense of the important service rendered by the\r\n2nd battalion, XVIIIth Royal Irish during the present rebellion,\r\nand also of the admirable conduct of the officers and men, who\r\nhave invariably maintained the most cordial relations with their\r\nfellow-subjects. Their approaching departure is viewed with deep and\r\ngeneral regret both on public and on personal grounds.”[222]\r\n\r\nIn a speech made by Sir George Arney, Chief Justice of the Colony, on\r\nthe 16th of February 1870, the following passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n  “I believe that every inhabitant of New Zealand has heard often\r\n  of the 18th Royal Irish--has heard not only of that gallant and\r\n  distinguished regiment, but also of the society of gentlemen who\r\n  have won the affections, I believe, and certainly have commanded\r\n  the respect, of the whole colony. And that which I have said of\r\n  the Officers, I may in some degree also say of the men. As the\r\n  head of one special department, I can say that during my long\r\n  sojourn here, I have known no other regiment which has been so\r\n  distinguished by its freedom from crime; and the men of this\r\n  regiment have themselves thus become respected, not only by those\r\n  of their immediate class, but by all classes of society in the\r\n  Colony. That circumstance must be taken as due not only to the\r\n  efficient command of the Officer at the head of the regiment,\r\n  but also to the temper and discretion with which his orders have\r\n  been carried out by the Officers of the regiment. I will say but\r\n  little on the fact that this Colony is now losing the presence\r\n  of this gallant regiment; it is a subject which, I believe, is a\r\n  painful one to the hearts of the whole of the colonists in New\r\n  Zealand. I believe that the 18th will be universally regretted,\r\n  as they are now universally respected.”\r\n\r\nThe Ministers of the New Zealand government also gave their testimony\r\nto the good conduct of the regiment in a communication to the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “MEMORANDUM FOR HIS EXCELLENCY.\r\n\r\n  “Ministers cannot permit the last detachment of Her Majesty’s\r\n  18th regiment to leave the Colony without expressing the regret\r\n  which they feel at the departure of the regiment, and bearing\r\n  testimony of the uniform good conduct of the force under the\r\n  command of Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot, during the period of its\r\n  service in the Colony; the sentiment which the Government thus\r\n  places on record is that of the whole community.\r\n\r\n  “The Government also desires to express the feeling which it\r\n  entertains of the readiness which Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot,\r\n  and the Officers commanding detachments under him, have always\r\n  displayed to aid the Colony as far as lay in their power.\r\n\r\n  “The Government also desires to record its appreciation of the\r\n  uniform courtesy and consideration which they have experienced\r\n  on the part of Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot in their communications\r\n  with him through His Excellency the Governor.\r\n\r\n  “(Signed) WILLIAM FOX,\r\n  “_Premier_.”\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of March, 1870, the various detachments of the\r\nregiment had settled down in their new stations, but they were not\r\ndestined long to enjoy the pleasures of life in the capitals of the\r\nAustralian colonies,[223] for very soon came orders for the regiment\r\nto return to England. The policy of withdrawing all Imperial troops\r\nfrom New Zealand had been carried out. It was now Australia’s turn\r\nto be denuded of her garrison, and in August 1870, after hundreds of\r\nmen had taken their discharges in order to settle in Australasia,\r\nthe Royal Irish embarked for Plymouth. The sailing ship _Silver\r\nEagle_ left Sydney on the 21st of August with the four headquarter\r\ncompanies; Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot was in command, and with him\r\nwere one captain, four subalterns, two surgeons, and one hundred and\r\nthirty-five other ranks. On board the sailing ship _Corona_, which\r\nleft Melbourne about the same time, were Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nRocke and two other field-officers, five captains, nine subalterns,\r\nand two hundred and forty-six other ranks. The _Corona_ arrived at\r\nPlymouth on November 16; the _Silver Eagle_ made so long a voyage\r\nround Cape Horn that before she reached port on December 5th, it was\r\ncurrently reported that she had been lost at sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Australians were profoundly moved when the Royal Irish left their\r\nshores. The XVIIIth was already very popular, and apart from this\r\npersonal feeling, the settlers were deeply wounded at the removal of\r\nthis, the last British regiment of the garrison of Australasia. While\r\nall men regarded this step as the breaking of one of the few visible\r\nlinks between the mother country and her offshoots in the southern\r\nhemisphere, many pessimists hinted that the policy of the Home\r\ngovernment was intended to force all the colonies into a declaration\r\nof independence. When the _Corona_ sailed from Melbourne fifty\r\nthousand people crowded to the beach to wave a sad farewell to the\r\nXVIIIth, gloomily comparing the departure of the regiment with the\r\nabandonment of Britain by the Roman legions. Happily these prophets\r\nof evil were mistaken. The loyalty of the colonies to the Empire is\r\nunimpaired, and the tie of sentiment has been strengthened by the\r\npresence in three African campaigns of large bodies of volunteers\r\nfrom Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, who fought shoulder to\r\nshoulder with Imperial troops in quarrels with which the colonists\r\nwere concerned solely as members of the British race. Though the\r\noffer of two thousand Australasian militia and volunteers to serve\r\nagainst the Boers in the war of 1881 was refused by Mr Gladstone’s\r\ngovernment, four years later eight hundred men from New South Wales\r\nwere fighting at Suakim, and four hundred Canadian _voyageurs_\r\nwere steering whale-boats upon the Nile in the expedition towards\r\nKhartoum: while in the recent struggle with the Boers for the\r\npossession of South Africa, nearly thirty thousand men from Greater\r\nBritain represented the oversea provinces of the Empire in the army\r\nof the old country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the second battalion landed in England, it was quartered at\r\nDevonport, where the energies of the officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers were devoted to welding into shape the recruits enlisted to\r\nfill its depleted ranks. These youths were of poor physique and small\r\nstature, and only three hundred were finally accepted as suitable\r\nfor the Service, but good food and systematic training did wonders\r\nfor them: in a year their average height had increased an inch,\r\nwhile they had grown two inches wider round the chest. The burden of\r\ndrilling and disciplining this mass of raw material fell upon the\r\nadjutant, Lieutenant H. B. Moore; his success was so conspicuous\r\nthat when he left the army in 1873, Lieutenant-Colonel S. Wilson,\r\nwho in 1871 had succeeded Colonel Elliot in command, warmly thanked\r\nhim for his work in a regimental order. During the six years spent\r\nby the battalion at various garrison towns in England nothing of\r\ninterest occurred, except that the Royal Irish were represented in\r\nthe Ashantee war by Major T. D. Baker and Lieutenant I. W. Graves,\r\nboth of whom were mentioned in despatches.[224] In June, 1876,\r\nthe retirement of Colonel Wilson placed Lieutenant-Colonel R. H.\r\nDaniel in command; and in the following month began a tour of duty\r\nin Ireland, as barren of events as had been that in England. The\r\nbattalion was at Kilkenny in the spring of 1878, when in anticipation\r\nof a possible war with Russia part of the reserve was called out, and\r\nfour hundred men from the Kilkenny and Wexford militia were poured\r\ninto the ranks of the Royal Irish, whose officers led a strenuous\r\nlife during the three months of the embodiment. On the death of\r\nColonel Daniel in May, 1882, Lieutenant-Colonel C. F. Gregorie\r\narranged an exchange with Lieutenant-Colonel M. J. R. M‘Gregor, first\r\nbattalion, and was gazetted to the command of the second battalion on\r\nSeptember 14, 1878. After passing three years in Ireland, the home\r\nbattalion of the Royal Irish spent two years at Aldershot, and then\r\nwas moved to Chatham where the marching-in state showed a strength of\r\n15 officers, 37 sergeants, 12 drummers and 356 rank and file. Here\r\nit remained until August, 1882, when it embarked for Egypt on active\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTALION.\r\n\r\n1865-1884.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN ARMY ORGANISATION: THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment was winning\r\nits spurs in New Zealand, the first was quartered in southern India.\r\nAt the end of 1865 it was ordered home; volunteering into other corps\r\nwas permitted, and 381 non-commissioned officers and men elected to\r\nfinish their service in the East, while 29 officers[225] and 450\r\nother ranks, with 44 women and 72 children, embarked in February,\r\n1866, at Bombay in two ships, the slower of which did not reach\r\nEngland until the end of June. Two years later the battalion was\r\nsent to Ireland, and in August, 1871, was warned for another tour\r\nof foreign service. This order filled all ranks with dismay, for if\r\nany corps in the British army had the right to expect a long rest at\r\nhome it was the first battalion of the XVIIIth. Since 1692, when it\r\nfirst landed on the Continent, it had spent a hundred and nineteen\r\nyears out of the United Kingdom, and between 1837, when it sailed for\r\nCeylon, and its return from India in 1866, it had served abroad with\r\none short break of less than six months’ duration; it had fought with\r\ndistinction in China, in Burma, and in the Crimea, and had shared in\r\nthe suppression of the Indian Mutiny. To explain why the War Office\r\nsent the first battalion on foreign service again so quickly, it\r\nbecomes necessary to allude briefly to the long series of changes in\r\nthe organisation of the army which began to take effect in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe strain thrown on the military resources of Britain by the\r\nCrimean War and the Indian Mutiny had convinced even the most\r\ndetermined economists in the House of Commons not only that the army\r\nwas too small, but that it was utterly lacking in power of rapid\r\nexpansion in case of need. To increase its numbers in time of peace\r\nwas comparatively easy, and by the addition in 1858-59 of second\r\nbattalions to the twenty-five senior regiments of the line, the\r\ninfantry was materially strengthened. But to render the army more\r\nelastic, more fit to meet a sudden national emergency, was a far\r\nmore difficult matter. The process by which the XVIIIth was brought\r\nup to war strength for the Crimea[226] was the only method then\r\nknown for making a regiment ready to take the field, for as there\r\nwere no reservists to replace men too weakly or too young for a\r\ncampaign, the ranks of a corps ordered on active service could only\r\nbe filled by the depletion of other units, which by this process of\r\n“robbing Peter to pay Paul” were reduced to impotence, until they\r\nin turn had obtained recruits and trained the raw material into\r\nsoldiers. Of the various attempts to form an adequate reserve one\r\nonly was successful--the “militia reserve,” composed of the best\r\nmen in the constitutional force, who for a small annual retaining\r\nfee undertook in case of need to serve as regular soldiers in any\r\npart of the world. But this was only a reversion to the methods of\r\nthe Crimean days, for it called away the pick of the militia at the\r\nmoment when they were required, if not for active service, at least\r\nfor garrison duty at home and in the Mediterranean; and at best it\r\ncould produce but a limited supply of men who were obviously very\r\ninferior in quality to well-trained ex-regular soldiers. The problem\r\nof how to create an adequate reserve remained virtually unsolved for\r\nmany years, though numberless committees were appointed to consider\r\nthe question in all its bearings. The subject was, indeed, most\r\ncomplex. The army at home had to be prepared to defend the British\r\nIsles, to embark on expeditions beyond the limits of the United\r\nKingdom, and to replace the waste caused by death, by invaliding, and\r\nby the discharge of “time-expired” men among the troops abroad, of\r\nwhom 70,000 were quartered in India, while nearly 50,000 more were\r\nscattered in garrisons among our fortresses and colonies in other\r\nparts of the world. Gradually the opinion gained ground that it was\r\nhopeless to expect the army to discharge these varied duties, unless\r\nthere was behind it a large body of highly-trained and disciplined\r\nmen who, when a war was imminent, could be counted upon to reinforce\r\nthe troops at home; and the brilliant success of the Prussians in\r\n“the Seven Weeks’ War” of 1866, determined our government to adopt\r\na modification of the German principle of short service with the\r\nColours, followed by a period of service in the Reserve. To devise\r\na system suitable to an army recruited by voluntary enlistment,\r\nand of which a very large proportion is normally stationed abroad,\r\nrequired years of preparation, and it was not until 1870 that Mr\r\nCardwell, then Secretary of State for War, began to introduce\r\nthe great innovations which modernised the British army. By the\r\nabolition of “purchase,” rich men were no longer able to buy their\r\nsteps, and by the power of the purse obtain promotion over the heads\r\nof their poorer comrades; the ages were fixed at which officers\r\nof various ranks were to retire, so that a reasonable flow of\r\npromotion was obtained; the garrisons of the tropical colonies were\r\nreduced, while those of the great oversea provinces were gradually\r\nwithdrawn; recruits were enlisted for twelve years--the first six\r\nto be passed with the Colours, and the remainder in the Reserve;\r\nwhile to provide for an adequate and systematic flow of trained men\r\nto India and our other outlying possessions, regiments were linked\r\ntogether in pairs--one serving at home, the other abroad. One of the\r\nfunctions of the “home” battalion was to impart to the recruits the\r\nground-work of military training, and, when the young soldiers were\r\nfit to serve out of the United Kingdom, to send them in drafts to\r\nthe “foreign” battalion, where they remained for the rest of their\r\nservice with the Colours, and then on their return to the United\r\nKingdom were transferred to the Reserve. In the first twenty-five\r\nregiments, which already possessed two battalions, the process of\r\n“linking” was effected without the difficulty and friction which\r\nfrequently occurred in cases where two corps, strangers to each other\r\nin tradition and sentiment, were suddenly brought into the intimate\r\nrelation of virtual partnership; and when in 1882, regiments ceased\r\nto be designated by numbers, and the identity of the original units\r\nwas merged into that of the territorial regiment, the XVIIIth became\r\nthe Royal Irish regiment with no regret beyond that of the loss of\r\nthe number under which it had won distinctions in every part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs the second battalion had only just returned from New Zealand\r\nand Australia, it was the turn of the first battalion, under the\r\nnewly introduced system, to go abroad; and on January 18, 1872,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel G. H. Pocklington, with 26 officers and 606 other\r\nranks, embarked for Malta. After three years the first battalion,\r\n917 strong, sailed for India under command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nE. L. Dillon, and early in December reached Bareilly, where it was\r\nquartered for nearly four years. While it was at this station His\r\nMajesty King Edward VII., then Prince of Wales, made a Royal progress\r\nthrough the Eastern Empire that would one day be his, and on the\r\n6th of March, 1876, stopped at Bareilly on his way from the Terai\r\nto Allahabad: His Royal Highness was received by a guard of honour\r\nof the Royal Irish, while the remainder of the battalion lined the\r\navenue through which he passed on his way to the palace of the Nawab\r\nof Rampore. In the evening the Prince did the battalion the honour\r\nof dining with the officers, and gave to the mess portraits of the\r\nPrincess of Wales and himself as a memento of his visit, and a few\r\ndays later two large steel engravings of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales were sent by His Royal Highness as a present to the sergeants’\r\nmess. A year later the death occurred of Field-Marshal Sir John\r\nForster Fitzgerald, G.C.B.,[227] who since 1850, when he succeeded\r\nLord Aylmer, had been the Colonel of the XVIIIth, Royal Irish\r\nregiment. This veteran, whose age had earned for him the title of\r\n“the father of the British Army,” was born in Ireland in 1786, before\r\nthe abolition of the iniquitous system by which wealthy men were\r\nallowed to buy commissions for infants prattling in the nursery. At\r\nthe mature age of eight Fitzgerald was a captain in the regular army,\r\nat seventeen he was a major, and he obtained his lieutenant-colonelcy\r\nwhen only twenty-four years of age. He served in the Peninsula,\r\ncommanding a brigade in the battle of the Pyrenees in 1813; in 1854\r\nhe became General, and in 1875 received a Field-Marshal’s bâton. He\r\ndied in March, 1877, at Tours, and by the special order of Marshal\r\nMacmahon, then President of the French Republic, the whole of the\r\ngarrison attended the funeral to pay to the British officer the\r\nhonours accorded to Frenchmen of his exalted military rank. He was\r\nsucceeded as Colonel of the XVIIIth by Lieutenant-General Clement A.\r\nEdwards, C.B.[228]\r\n\r\nThe first battalion changed stations from Bareilly to Ferozepore\r\nin February, 1878, and just after Lieutenant-Colonel M. MacGregor\r\nsucceeded to the command on September 13, 1878, two companies were\r\ndetached to Mooltan, while a third was sent to Dera Ismail Khan,\r\none of the posts guarding the north-west frontier of India. For\r\na few days there seemed to be a chance of “blooding” some of the\r\nyoung soldiers of the XVIIIth, for the Mahsood Waziris raided into\r\nour country and burned the town of Tank some thirty miles from Dera\r\nIsmail Khan. The native cavalry of the garrison were at once sent\r\nto the scene of the outrage, and fell heavily upon the freebooters,\r\nmany of whom were killed and wounded, while the remainder fled to\r\nthe neighbouring hills, where they threw up sangars and challenged\r\nus to attack them. But the officer in command of the British column\r\nwas not disposed to squander the lives of his troops by assaulting\r\nstone breast-works without a preliminary bombardment; and remembering\r\nthat some of the Royal Irish had been taught gun-drill at Dera Ismail\r\nKhan, he ordered up a couple of pieces, manned by soldiers of the\r\nXVIIIth under an officer of the regiment, Lieutenant H. Shuldham-Lye.\r\nThe amateur gunners, “spoiling for a fight,” pushed on to Tank at\r\nspeed, but when the tribesmen heard that guns were to be used against\r\nthem they suddenly dispersed, and the little campaign came to an end.\r\nFor its services the detachment was officially thanked by the officer\r\nin command of the operations.\r\n\r\nA few months after the Royal Irish arrived at Ferozepore Russian\r\nintrigues involved Britain in war with Afghanistan, an independent\r\nState whose mountains overhang part of the north-west frontier of\r\nIndia. As early as 1837, England and Russia were contending for the\r\nprivilege of directing the foreign policy of the Amir of Afghanistan,\r\nupon whose borders the rival European Powers were advancing by giant\r\nstrides in the course of their Asiatic conquests; and when the Amir,\r\nDost Mahomed, cordially welcomed a Russian officer, who brought from\r\nthe Czar proposals for an alliance against England, our government\r\ndetermined to depose Dost Mahomed and to replace him with a nominee\r\nof their own. The attempt to carry this scheme into execution\r\nproduced the first Afghan war, in which the Czar made no effort to\r\nhelp the Amir, being satisfied at having involved his great rival in\r\nan expensive and disastrous campaign with the country he proposed\r\nsome day to use as a stepping-stone in the invasion of India. At the\r\nend of the Crimean war Russia, foiled in her projects against Turkey,\r\ndevoted her energies to the subjugation of Central Asia, where vast\r\nterritories fell into her hands; and by the conquest of Khiva in\r\n1873, she advanced her outposts to within four hundred miles of our\r\nIndian frontier, establishing herself within easy striking distance\r\nof Afghanistan. Shere Ali, the Amir, trembling for his independence,\r\noffered his friendship to England if she would give him a specific\r\npromise of help against Muscovite aggression, but as our government\r\nrefused any such guarantee he decided to throw in his lot with\r\nRussia. In 1877, there was war between the Sultan and the Czar, and\r\nas it seemed probable that England would again intervene by force\r\nof arms to save Turkey from annihilation, the Russians intrigued\r\nmore vigorously than ever with Afghanistan, sending a military envoy\r\nto the Amir, who received him with every mark of distinction. To\r\ncounteract the effect produced in every village in India by the\r\nknowledge that a Russian envoy had been officially welcomed at Kabul,\r\nthe Viceroy decided that a British mission should visit Shere Ali,\r\nwho was informed that Sir Neville Chamberlain was coming to discuss\r\nmatters of importance with him in a friendly spirit. In due time the\r\nmission set forth from Peshawar, but in the Khyber Pass, just within\r\nthe Amir’s boundary, its members were turned back by Afghan troops,\r\nwho under orders from Kabul refused to allow them to advance farther\r\ninto Afghanistan. As Shere Ali declined to apologise for this insult,\r\nwar became inevitable, and after our ultimatum had been rejected\r\nBritish troops invaded his country from various points.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to describe the operations of the second Afghan\r\nwar, for the first battalion of the Royal Irish, upon whom fortune\r\nhad frowned during the Mutiny, were still pursued by ill luck, and\r\nplayed but the smallest part in the campaign. Though the war began in\r\nNovember 1878, it was not until the beginning of the following year\r\nthat the first battalion was ordered up from Ferozepore to join the\r\nreserve division of the Northern Afghanistan field force at Peshawar.\r\nA few weeks later this division was broken up; the battalion was\r\ntransferred to the Khyber Line force; and on May 2, 1879, eight\r\nhundred and four stalwart Royal Irishmen found themselves at the\r\nfoot of the great wall of rock which forbids access to Afghanistan\r\nfrom the plains of India.[229] This natural rampart is pierced by\r\nthe Khyber Pass--a dark and gloomy gorge, winding its way between\r\nhigh mountains which so nearly approach each other that in places\r\ntheir rugged sides are only ten or twelve feet apart. Through this\r\ndefile, one of the most difficult in the world, runs the track which\r\nfor centuries has been the highway of commerce between Central Asia\r\nand Hindustan. In the middle of the pass the mountains, suddenly\r\nreceding, form a plain, where the battalion spent the next ten\r\nmonths in discharging the useful but unattractive duties which\r\nfall to the lot of line of communication troops. They had to hold\r\nLundi Kotal and Ali Musjid; to provide escorts for convoys through\r\nthe pass, and to piquet the neighbouring hills. The guards were\r\nnumerous, for the local tribesmen were expert thieves, to whom every\r\nBritish rifle was worth its weight in rupees; and notwithstanding\r\nthe vigilance of the sentries in the sangars round the camp, Afridi\r\nrobbers succeeded in abstracting a few firearms from the tents in\r\nwhich the men were sleeping. A good many non-commissioned officers\r\nand privates were lucky enough to escape from the drudgery of this\r\nexistence by obtaining employment as signallers on the Kabul-Peshawar\r\nline, where from constant practice they became experts with flag and\r\nheliograph. During the summer there was a sharp outbreak of cholera\r\nin the battalion, which cost the lives of Quartermaster R. Barrett\r\nand sixty of the other ranks.[230] “It came up from India in the\r\nmost curious way, right along the signallers’ posts. We heard of it\r\nfirst at Jumrood; a few days afterwards a man in the first post was\r\ntaken ill; a few days more and the second post was attacked, though\r\nthere appeared to be no communication possible (except by heliograph)\r\nbetween the posts, and it gradually kept on till it reached the\r\nregiment. We knew it was coming; we could not move, and I think,”\r\nwrites an officer, “that it showed the staunchness of the Royal\r\nIrish that they never went to pieces at all.” To keep up the spirits\r\nof the men and give them some amusement the officers rigged up a\r\ngymnasium and laid out a polo-ground and racecourse, where regimental\r\ngymkhanas were often held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AFGHANISTAN, EGYPT (1882) AND NILE CROSS AT\r\nCLONMEL.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the first battalion was not actively engaged in the Afghan\r\nwar, the officers and men who served in the Khyber Pass received the\r\nmedal, and the regiment was permitted to add the words “Afghanistan\r\n1879-80” to its battle honours. At the end of the campaign in 1881\r\nthe Royal Irish returned to India, and for the next two years and a\r\nhalf oscillated between the great cantonment of Rawal Pindi and the\r\nhill station of Kuldurrah. On May 23, 1882, when Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nM. MacGregor’s term of command expired, he was succeeded by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel H. Shaw, V.C., and in July of the same year the\r\ndeath of Lieutenant-General Edwards broke one of the few links still\r\nconnecting the XVIIIth with its campaigns in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. He died full of years and honours, respected and\r\nadmired not only by the regiment with which he had passed the best\r\nyears of his life, but by every officer and man with whom he had\r\nserved during his long career.[231] Lieutenant-General and Honorary\r\nGeneral Sir Alexander Macdonnell, K.C.B., was appointed to replace\r\nhim as Colonel.[232] A few weeks after the Royal Irish lost their\r\nColonel, the second battalion sailed from England for Egypt to\r\ntake part in the campaign described in the next chapter. The first\r\nbattalion continued to serve in India until August, 1884, when in\r\nits turn it was summoned to Egypt as one of the corps selected for\r\nthe attempt to rescue General Gordon from the dangers besetting him\r\nat Khartoum. The account of the doings of the first battalion in the\r\nNile Expedition will be found in chapter xii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTALION.\r\n\r\n1882-1883.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter iv. the campaign of 1801 is described, in which the Royal\r\nIrish regiment played a distinguished part in the expulsion of the\r\nFrench from Egypt. To explain why, more than eighty years later,\r\nit became necessary for British troops again to take the field in\r\nthe valley of the Nile, a few words of historical retrospect are\r\nnecessary. Our short occupation of Egypt in 1801 was purely military\r\nand in no way interfered with the status of the country, which for\r\nmany years continued nominally to be a province of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. In the first half of the nineteenth century an adventurer\r\nnamed Mahomed Ali, who started in life as a small government official\r\nin Turkish employ, made himself master of Egypt and conquered the\r\nSoudan, a vast no-man’s land, which from Wadi-Halfa, the southern\r\nboundary of Egypt proper, stretched for 1300 miles up the valley of\r\nthe Nile. For thirty years he waged an intermittent war with the\r\nSublime Porte, occupying Syria and threatening the safety of the\r\nSultan in Constantinople itself, until the great Powers of Europe,\r\nwhich in 1827 had combined to destroy the Turkish fleet at Navarino,\r\nunited in 1840 to save the Ottoman Empire from disruption, and sent\r\na joint naval expedition against Mahomed’s garrisons on the Syrian\r\nseaboard. Next year the Sultan made peace with his rebellious vassal,\r\nwho restored Syria to his overlord as the price of the hereditary\r\nviceroyalty of Egypt, which was then conferred upon him. A few\r\nyears later the opening of the “overland route,” by which mails and\r\npassengers for the East were carried between Alexandria and Suez,\r\nbegan to bring Egypt closely within the sphere of British politics;\r\nand the completion in 1869 of the Suez canal by a French company,\r\nwhose moving spirit was M. de Lesseps, the engineer, made the safety\r\nof the new waterway, and the good government of the country through\r\nwhich it ran a matter of paramount importance to the British\r\nEmpire.[233] Yet England by no means desired to add the possession of\r\nEgypt to her other burdens. Her attitude is well described by Lord\r\nCromer:\r\n\r\n  “The general political interest of England was clear. England\r\n  did not want to possess Egypt, but it was essential to British\r\n  interests that the country should not fall into the hands of\r\n  any other European Power. British policy, in respect to Egypt,\r\n  had for years past been based on this principle. In 1857 the\r\n  Emperor Napoleon III. made overtures to the British Government\r\n  with a view to the partition of the northern portions of Africa.\r\n  Morocco was to fall to France, Tunis to Sardinia, and Egypt to\r\n  England. On this proposal being submitted to Lord Palmerston,\r\n  he stated his views in a letter to Lord Clarendon. ‘It is very\r\n  possible,’ he said, ‘that many parts of the world would be better\r\n  governed by France, England, and Sardinia than they now are....\r\n  We do not want to have Egypt. What we wish about Egypt is that it\r\n  should continue to be attached to the Turkish Empire, which is\r\n  a security against its belonging to any European Power. We want\r\n  to trade with Egypt and to travel through Egypt, but we do not\r\n  want the burden of governing Egypt.... Let us try and improve all\r\n  these countries by the general influence of our commerce, but let\r\n  us abstain from a crusade of conquest which would call down upon\r\n  us the condemnation of all other civilised nations.’ On another\r\n  occasion Lord Palmerston used the following homely but apt\r\n  illustration. ‘We do not want Egypt or wish for it ourselves any\r\n  more than any rational man with an estate in the north of England\r\n  and a residence in the south would have wished to possess the\r\n  inns on the north road. All he could want would have been that\r\n  the inns should be well kept, always accessible, and furnishing\r\n  him when he came with mutton chops and post-horses.’”[234]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Egypt was anything but well governed. A thin veneer of\r\nEuropean civilisation barely concealed the barbaric methods of the\r\nEast, and the corruption and extravagance of her rulers were almost\r\nincredible. In 1863, her public debt was about three millions and\r\na quarter sterling.[235] Thirteen years later, under the rule of\r\nIsmail, it had increased to sixty-eight millions, with a floating or\r\nunfunded debt of twenty-six millions more, or ninety-four millions\r\nin all. As the funded debt had been contracted in Europe, chiefly in\r\nthe money markets of London and Paris, and as a large portion of the\r\nfloating debt was due to European creditors, the English and French\r\nCabinets wrung from the Khedive a reluctant consent that European\r\nmen of business should be appointed to investigate the financial\r\ncondition of his country. In 1878, the Anglo-French committee of\r\nenquiry discovered that the finances of Egypt were rotten to the\r\ncore. For the debt of ninety-four millions there was practically\r\nnothing to show, except the Suez canal, towards the building of which\r\nthe Government of Egypt had contributed sixteen millions.[236] There\r\nwas no money to pay the interest on the bonds, and the old method\r\nof raising a fresh loan to pay the interest on those already in\r\nexistence was obviously no longer possible.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that the influence of high-principled European men of\r\nbusiness would improve the government, the Powers insisted that the\r\nKhedive should employ ministers of their selection. He did so, but\r\nby resolutely obstructing the officials thus imposed upon him, he\r\nreduced the administration to such a state of chaos that in June,\r\n1879, the patience of England and France was exhausted, and with\r\nthe concurrence of the other Powers and the reluctant consent of\r\nthe Sultan, the Khedive was deposed in favour of his son, Prince\r\nTewfik. The change of viceroy did not, however, produce the result\r\nanticipated. Affairs did not improve under Tewfik’s rule; by the\r\nend of 1881 the population was in a ferment; a strong anti-European\r\nfeeling had arisen among the people, while the army was mutinous,\r\nand regarded not Tewfik but Arabi, a clever and intriguing Egyptian\r\ncolonel, as its master. With the object of strengthening the\r\nKhedive’s position, England and France in January, 1882, addressed to\r\nTewfik a “dual note,” stating that they considered his maintenance\r\non the throne as the sole guarantee of good order and prosperity\r\nin Egypt. This note, however, in no way impressed the population;\r\nthe condition of the country daily grew more unsatisfactory, and by\r\nMay a series of military demonstrations had made Arabi the virtual\r\ndictator of Egypt, though Tewfik continued in name to be its ruler.\r\nMassacres of Christians in various parts of the country caused an\r\nenormous exodus of the European population,[237] trade was completely\r\ndislocated, and the safety of the Suez canal appeared imperilled.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian army, exclusive of the garrison of the Soudan, consisted\r\nof about 9000 men actually serving with the Colours, but more than\r\n50,000 men had passed through the ranks into the reserve, and in the\r\nBedouins, the dwellers in the desert, Arabi had a further reserve,\r\nthough of very doubtful value. His artillery was powerful; exclusive\r\nof heavy guns there were forty-eight batteries of field-artillery,\r\nnot, however, fully horsed. When war broke out the reserve men were\r\nrecalled, and 40,000 recruits enlisted, who after a few days’ drill\r\nwere thrust, virtually untrained, into the ranks. Egypt was rich in\r\nhorses and camels, and in addition to the horses required for the\r\nartillery, eleven thousand transport animals were obtained from the\r\npopulation. Nominally, these beasts were the free-will offerings of\r\ntheir owners, but there is reason to believe that the generosity of\r\ntheir donors was greatly stimulated by the use of the _courbash_.\r\n\r\nDuring 1881, and the first part of 1882, many communications on the\r\nsubject of Egypt had passed between the governments of England and\r\nFrance and the other European Powers.[238] All were agreed that order\r\nshould be restored on the banks of the Nile, but, save England and\r\nFrance, none seemed disposed to undertake the task. At first France\r\nwas much more inclined to a military intervention than Britain,\r\nfor England in 1882 no more desired to annex Egypt than in 1857,\r\nwhen she rejected the French Emperor’s schemes for the partition\r\nof northern Africa. But she remembered that, even before the time\r\nof the great Napoleon, France had cast covetous eyes upon Egypt,\r\nand as it was impossible for England to allow Egypt to be occupied\r\nby any Continental nation, her obvious policy was to co-operate\r\nwith France, and by re-establishing order and good government in\r\nthe country to render the Egyptians capable of managing their own\r\naffairs without European guidance. To this policy England loyally\r\nadhered until France refused to advance further in the matter. As\r\ntangible evidence that the Western Powers really intended to support\r\nthe Khedive, an Anglo-French squadron was sent to Alexandria, where\r\nit lay for several weeks, until our Admiral, Lord Alcester (then\r\nSir Beauchamp Seymour), discovered that in direct defiance of the\r\nKhedive’s orders, Arabi was preparing to make good his threat to\r\nattack any European troops landing in Egypt. Not only was he mounting\r\nguns on the fortifications, but he was also attempting to prevent the\r\nBritish fleet from leaving the port by secretly throwing great blocks\r\nof stone into the entrance of the harbour. Through Lord Alcester, the\r\nBritish government informed Arabi that unless he at once desisted\r\nthe forts would be shelled. Arabi promised compliance, but when\r\nthe search-lights from the ships were turned on, it was seen that\r\nunder cover of night the work was being pressed forward.[239] The\r\ndanger to the fleet soon grew too serious to be ignored, and after\r\nrepeated but equally fruitless warnings, notice was given to Arabi\r\nthat on the 11th of July the forts would be bombarded. Thereupon the\r\nFrench Admiral announced that his instructions did not permit him to\r\ntake part in such an operation, and on the 10th he steamed out of\r\nAlexandria, leaving his British colleague in the lurch. The forts\r\nwere bombarded with complete success, and Arabi, retiring inland for\r\na few miles, threatened Alexandria from a position at Kafr-el-Dauar,\r\nastride the railway to Cairo. To save the town from pillage by its\r\nmob, and to defend it against attack by the Egyptian army, a large\r\nnumber of British sailors and soldiers were landed. The troops had\r\njust arrived from Cyprus, where, under Lieutenant-General Sir A.\r\nAlison, a brigade, supplied by the Mediterranean garrisons, had been\r\nassembled with secret orders to seize and protect the Suez canal\r\nagainst Arabi, who had openly expressed his determination to destroy\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile preparations for an expedition were on foot in England.\r\nAn army corps drawn from the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean\r\ngarrisons, and India was to be sent to Egypt under command of Lord\r\nWolseley (then Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley) with the\r\ntemporary rank of General. It consisted of a cavalry division, two\r\ninfantry divisions, artillery, engineers, and a strong contingent\r\nof British and native soldiers from India. In the first division,\r\nunder Lieutenant-General G. H. S. Willis, were the 1st, or brigade\r\nof Guards, commanded by H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and the\r\n2nd brigade (in which was the 2nd battalion of the Royal Irish),\r\nunder Major-General G. Graham. The second division, commanded by\r\nLieutenant-General Sir E. Hamley, was composed of the brigades of\r\nMajor-General Sir A. Alison and Major-General Sir E. Wood. The Indian\r\ncontingent, which was to join Lord Wolseley in Egypt, was led by\r\nMajor-General Sir H. T. Macpherson. The total number of troops who\r\nembarked as part of the original army corps were 25,309.[240] The\r\nunits selected for the war were mobilised; the reserve, or to be\r\nstrictly accurate, those of its members who had left the Colours\r\nwithin two years were called out; transports were engaged and fitted\r\nup for troops, and the House of Commons voted the necessary money.\r\nSuddenly the policy of France completely veered round, and on the\r\n29th of July, only nine days after the French Ministry had formally\r\nengaged to take part in the expedition, the Chamber by an enormous\r\nmajority refused to spend a penny upon the restoration of law and\r\norder in Egypt. This remarkable change of front, which not only threw\r\nthe whole expense, but the whole conduct of the expedition upon the\r\nBritish, was doubtless annoying to our statesmen, but agreeable to\r\nour generals, many of whom knew from personal experience in China\r\nand the Crimea how difficult co-operation with our French allies had\r\nproved in those campaigns. The defection of the French caused no\r\nalteration in Lord Wolseley’s plans. To crush the Khedive’s mutinous\r\narmy and to restore order among his subjects it was essential\r\nthat Cairo, the hot-bed of disaffection, should be occupied as\r\nspeedily as possible by British troops, and this he proposed to\r\ndo by landing, not at Alexandria, but at Ismailia, a town on the\r\ncanal half-way between Suez and Port Said. From Ismailia to Cairo\r\nis about seventy-five miles, while from Alexandria to the capital\r\nis nearly double that distance. By the former route the track would\r\nlie alongside a canal of drinkable water, over hard sand which made\r\na fair surface for marching. In the latter route, _i.e._ through\r\nthe Delta of the Nile, there were practically no roads fit for\r\nwheeled vehicles, the local traffic being carried on by railway,\r\nby pack animals, and by boats on the innumerable canals by which\r\nthe country is irrigated. Moreover, during the months of August,\r\nSeptember, and October--the time of “high Nile,” which was rapidly\r\napproaching--the whole of the Delta is under water. Thus, of the two\r\nlines of advance, that through the desert was obviously the better\r\none, and it possessed the additional advantage that the preparations\r\nfor undertaking it served to protect the Suez canal from attack, and\r\nto secure possession of the canals by which Suez, Ismailia, and Port\r\nSaid are supplied with drinking water. It was of the first importance\r\nthat Arabi should remain in complete ignorance of the British plans;\r\nand thus the bombardment of Alexandria and the landing of Alison’s\r\nbrigade, neither of which had formed part of Lord Wolseley’s original\r\nscheme, turned to our advantage, for the arrival of Alison’s troops\r\nconfirmed the Egyptian General in his opinion that the invading army\r\nwould disembark at Alexandria. Wolseley seized every opportunity\r\nto strengthen him in this belief; Alison was ordered to keep Arabi\r\nconstantly in fear of an attack, and succeeded in doing so by a\r\nseries of demonstrations against the works which the rebel army had\r\nthrown up.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July the troops began to leave the United Kingdom: and\r\nthe second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment, almost the last\r\ncorps to sail, embarked on August 8, 1882, at Plymouth, bound, as was\r\nthen believed by all on board, for Alexandria. To enable the reader\r\nto appreciate the situation when the battalion reached the seat of\r\nwar, it is necessary to give a short account of the events which took\r\nplace while it was still at sea. On the 15th of August Lord Wolseley\r\narrived at Alexandria, and with his naval colleague, Admiral Lord\r\nAlcester, settled the details of the combined operation by which the\r\nsailors in the men-of-war already stationed in the Suez canal were\r\nto seize and hold the towns upon its banks, until the soldiers could\r\nbegin to land at Ismailia. A considerable portion of the expedition\r\nhad already disembarked at Alexandria, and transports were daily,\r\nalmost hourly, arriving from England. The question of how these\r\ntroops were to be re-embarked and despatched to the canal without\r\ngiving Arabi any clue to their destination now had to be solved.\r\nThroughout his career as a soldier, Wolseley had urged the necessity\r\nof deceiving your enemy in war: now he had a great opportunity to\r\ngive the British army an object lesson in the art of mystifying\r\nan opponent, and right well did he avail himself of it. A strong\r\nbeliever in the truth of the axiom that whatever is rumoured in your\r\ncamp to-day will be known to-morrow to the enemy, he determined to\r\nmislead, not only Arabi but the whole of the British army as to his\r\nintentions. Orders were accordingly issued for a combined naval and\r\nmilitary attack from the sea upon the forts at Aboukir Bay, supported\r\nby the troops left to garrison Alexandria. Not even General Hamley,\r\nwho was in command at Alexandria, was in the secret; and with the\r\nhelp of his brigadiers, Alison and Wood, he worked out elaborate\r\ndetails for co-operation in the advance of the main body after it\r\nhad landed at Aboukir Bay; the scheme was submitted to Wolseley and\r\ngravely approved! At noon on the 19th of August all the troops,\r\nexcept those left to hold Alexandria, were on board their ships,\r\nand eight ironclads and seventeen transports steamed away towards\r\nAboukir. Before his departure the Commander-in-Chief handed a sealed\r\npacket containing his real plan to General Hamley, with strict orders\r\nnot to open it till early on the morning of the 20th. The fleet\r\nreached Aboukir in four hours, and anchored till nightfall, when\r\nthe gunboats and other small naval craft stood inshore and engaged\r\nthe forts, while the big ships slipped away unobserved and arrived\r\nat Port Said early next morning, to find that the navy had carried\r\nout their instructions admirably. The sailors had surprised the\r\ndetachments of the enemy watching Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez;\r\nthese places were in their hands. They were in possession of the\r\nwhole of the Suez canal. They had prevented any vessels from entering\r\nit and, to clear the way for the transports, had ordered all steamers\r\nthen in the canal to tie up at the _gares_ or shunting-places,\r\nfamiliar to every soldier whose service has taken him east of Suez.\r\nThe merchant ships complied with three exceptions. A French mail-boat\r\nclaimed the right to pass, and was allowed to do so as a matter of\r\ninternational courtesy: two English master mariners of the baser sort\r\ndisobeyed, and when the British gunboat that regulated the traffic\r\nwas out of sight they followed in the Frenchman’s wake. This incident\r\nconsiderably delayed the entrance of the British fleet into the\r\nCanal, but by the evening of the 23rd, the day before the Royal Irish\r\nreached Lake Timsah, 9000 men and a few stores had been landed at\r\nIsmailia; the fresh-water canal and the whole line of railway between\r\nSuez and Ismailia had fallen into our hands, and communication by\r\nland had thus been secured with the Indian contingent, which had\r\nbegun to disembark at Suez on the 20th. Thanks to Lord Wolseley’s\r\n_ruse de guerre_, these successes had been obtained almost without\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe report that Aboukir was to be bombarded duly reached Arabi, who\r\nsent large reinforcements to the threatened forts. The Egyptians\r\nbelieved that the Delta was the object of the British attack, and\r\nconsequently had concentrated the greater part of their army at the\r\nmouths of the Nile, with a body of 12,000 men at Tel-el-Kebir, a\r\npost in the eastern desert thirty-three miles to the westward of\r\nIsmailia. To this flank guard was allotted the duty of defending\r\nthe Delta against an enemy based on the canal, and of guarding\r\nZag-a-zig, the most important junction in the railway system of\r\nEgypt. By his successful feint upon Aboukir, Wolseley prevented the\r\ndespatch of reinforcements from the Delta to Tel-el-Kebir, and thanks\r\nto the rapidity with which the naval landing-parties had seized the\r\ntelegraph lines, news of the occupation of the Suez canal did not\r\nreach the garrison of Tel-el-Kebir in time to enable them to oppose\r\nour disembarkation at Ismailia. Very shortly after Arabi heard that\r\nWolseley had landed on the bank of the canal he transferred his\r\nHeadquarters to Tel-el-Kebir, where his Intelligence department must\r\nhave been singularly inefficient, for, “strange as it may appear,\r\nit now seems to be certain that the great transfer of force on the\r\n19th of August from Alexandria to Ismailia remained unknown to Arabi\r\ntill he heard of it with evident astonishment about a year later in\r\nCeylon,”[241] where, after the war was over, he was detained as a\r\npolitical prisoner. But though the British General had thus stolen a\r\nmarch upon his enemy, many difficulties still confronted him, well\r\ndescribed in the following extract from the official history of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n  “There was only one small pier at Ismailia. Ships did not at\r\n  first anchor nearer than about half a mile from the shore. Every\r\n  man, every horse and every gun, as well as all the ammunition and\r\n  stores for the supply of the army, had first to be transhipped\r\n  from the transports into barges and small boats, rowed or tugged\r\n  to shore, and then landed on the small pier.... In no sense were\r\n  the conditions for the rapid landing of a large number of troops\r\n  and of a vast quantity of stores in existence at Ismailia. It\r\n  is true that this state of things could be ultimately changed\r\n  by our engineers. But this would also be a question of time.\r\n  Every tool, every scrap of material, all the bridging stores\r\n  and all the means of constructing other piers, for laying\r\n  down tramways and increasing the pier accommodation must, by\r\n  an inexorable necessity, be first landed under the conditions\r\n  actually existing. Materials for all these purposes, including\r\n  landing-stages expressly made for Ismailia, had been prepared\r\n  in England before the expedition sailed, but it would not be\r\n  possible to send them forward in the most advanced vessels\r\n  of the fleet, for those ships must be otherwise filled. In\r\n  order to secure the all-important lines of communication--the\r\n  railway and Sweet-water canal--for the advance from Ismailia,\r\n  it was essential that the first vessels of the fleet should be\r\n  occupied by the troops which would be sent forward to seize\r\n  them. These troops, once sent forward, must be supplied with\r\n  food and ammunition, so that a considerable force, with all\r\n  its guns and equipment, tons of supplies, ordnance stores and\r\n  ammunition and the means of local transport ... must be sent\r\n  on in the most advanced ships before any engineering material\r\n  for the improvement of the means of landing ... could be put on\r\n  shore.”[242]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians had dammed the “Sweet-water” canal at Magfar, a few\r\nmiles west of Ismailia, and the water, the only supply for the towns\r\non the Suez canal and for the army when it moved into the desert,\r\nwas falling rapidly. While keeping every available man at work at\r\nIsmailia, Lord Wolseley sent Graham with a small force of all arms\r\nto Magfar, and after two days’ skirmishing, not only occupied that\r\nplace, but Kassasin also, where an important lock, twenty miles\r\nup the canal from Ismailia, fell into our hands. Here Wolseley\r\ndetermined to establish an advanced base, where, under the protection\r\nof a comparatively small force, supplies could be accumulated in\r\nreadiness for the campaign in the desert. Graham was left in charge\r\nof this post; among his troops were two of the units of his brigade\r\n(the 2nd), viz.: a battalion of Royal Marine Light Infantry and the\r\n2nd battalion, York and Lancaster regiment; the remainder of his\r\ncommand, the 2nd battalion of the Royal Irish regiment and the 1st\r\nbattalion of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, though they landed on the\r\nnight of the 24th, did not take part in these preliminary operations,\r\nbeing detained at Ismailia to help in unloading the store-ships and\r\ntransports.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish arrived from England with a total strength of\r\nseven hundred and seventy-one, including a hundred and fifty\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men from the reserve.[243] Among\r\ntheir fellow-passengers was a newspaper correspondent, Major Terry,\r\na half-pay officer, who found the XVIIIth such good comrades that\r\nhe attached himself to the battalion throughout the war. From his\r\naccount the voyage was a pleasant one, the ship comfortable, and the\r\ntroops well fed. The time passed quickly, for in addition to the\r\nordinary routine of life on board a transport, the officers were\r\nhard at work reading the books on Egypt with which Colonel Gregorie\r\nhad provided himself, and lecturing to the men about the country\r\nin which they were going to fight. The correspondent described the\r\nrank and file as “rather under height, but a very broad-shouldered\r\nand robust body of men, with quiet manners and pleasant to talk\r\nto. Intensely Irish, they easily brighten into excitement in their\r\namusements, and when their own stirring national airs are played\r\nby the band.” At Malta the XVIIIth heard many rumours about Lord\r\nWolseley’s plans, but the only definite information they received\r\nwas the order to paint their helmets and belts mud-colour, and to\r\ndull the brass-work on their uniforms. To our modern ideas the\r\nred serge jumpers and blue serge trousers in which the expedition\r\ntook the field was a kit singularly ill adapted for a campaign in\r\nEgypt. Spine-pads and spectacles with blue glasses were served\r\nout, but many men did not understand the value of these novel\r\narticles of equipment, and lost them, much to their sorrow when\r\na few days later they found themselves in the desert exposed to\r\nthe full blaze of a semi-tropical sun. On the 22nd the _City of\r\nParis_ reached Alexandria, and was immediately ordered on to Port\r\nSaid, where the battalion found the navy in possession of the town,\r\napparently quite as much at home there as in Portsmouth harbour. As\r\nthe ship was steaming slowly along the canal, the Royal Irish were\r\nmuch entertained by a party of bluejackets, stationed at Kantara\r\nto protect the floating bridge. The guard of sailors turned out\r\nand presented arms in the most orthodox fashion; and then produced\r\na concertina and played “Rule Britannia,” dancing on the sand and\r\nswinging their cutlasses round their heads with immense energy.\r\n\r\nOn August 24, the _City of Paris_ arrived at Lake Timsah, and\r\nanchored in the midst of a great fleet of warships and transports,\r\nthe latter surrounded by steam-launches, tugs, and lighters, all\r\nbusily employed in landing at Ismailia the _personnel_ and _matériel_\r\nof the expedition. This town, a creation of M. de Lesseps, is on the\r\nwestern shore of the lake, where, half-hidden in groves of palm and\r\nplane trees, it lies like a green oasis in a desert of yellow sand.\r\nHere the Royal Irish remained for the next four days, earning golden\r\nopinions by the sustained energy which they displayed in carrying\r\nout the irksome duty of moving stores from the water-side to the\r\nrailway station. Then came the welcome order to join their brigade\r\nat Kassasin. They moved in detachments, constantly halting to help\r\nrepair the railway and to clear obstructions from the Sweet-water\r\ncanal. The march was a singularly unpleasant one: the heat was very\r\ngreat, the dust and flies were exasperating to a degree, the tents\r\nhad gone astray, and the only water to be had was from the canal,\r\nwhich belied its name, as it was polluted by the dead bodies of\r\nEgyptian soldiers. Several of the stations on the railway showed\r\ntraces of the recent presence of Arabi’s troops, who in their flight\r\nhad abandoned their rifles and ammunition, and left their dead\r\nunburied behind them. There was so much work to be done on the line\r\nthat it was not until late on the 8th of September that the last\r\ncompanies of the Royal Irish reached Kassasin.\r\n\r\nArabi had been misled by the lying reports of his Bedouin scouts, who\r\ninformed him that they had cut the communication between Ismailia\r\nand Kassasin, and that the latter was held by a small force, whereas\r\nas a matter of fact the railway from Ismailia to the front was in\r\nworking order; Kassasin was occupied by about 8000 men under General\r\nWillis, and the brigade of Guards, a battery, and a regiment of\r\ncavalry were all within reinforcing distance. Acting on this false\r\ninformation, he determined to take the offensive, and at dawn on the\r\n9th he put his troops in motion and pushed from Tel-el-Kebir towards\r\nKassasin with several squadrons of cavalry, thirty or thirty-one\r\nguns, and seventeen battalions of infantry. His cavalry advance-guard\r\ngreatly outnumbered our mounted troops, who however succeeded in\r\nholding back the Egyptian horsemen, until the infantry had taken\r\nup a position astride the canal to meet the attack now threatening\r\nfrom the west and north. Covered by a vigorous but comparatively\r\nharmless cannonade, the enemy’s infantry, a large part of which had\r\nbeen brought by train, advanced towards the camp, the uniforms of the\r\nregular soldiers contrasting strongly with the white robes of the\r\nBedouins as they moved over the low sandy hummocks of the desert. For\r\na time General Willis stood on the defensive, and the Royal Irish\r\nwere detailed as the escort to the field-guns. Then he gave orders\r\nfor a general advance, and the battalion was placed in echelon on\r\nthe right rear of the first line of Graham’s brigade, ready to form\r\nfront to the right, and face the flank attack which for a moment was\r\nanticipated. At first the battalion moved in quarter column, and\r\nthen in line; at no time during the 9th was it extended for attack,\r\nfor the British guns played so rapidly upon the Egyptians that they\r\nfell back in disorder, giving Graham’s brigade no opportunity to\r\nclose with them; and by half-past ten the enemy had retired to his\r\nworks at Tel-el-Kebir, leaving four field-pieces in our hands. From\r\nhis entrenchments Arabi opened an angry but harmless artillery fire\r\nupon the troops, who by General Willis’s directions halted out of\r\nrange. In ceasing his pursuit at a moment when it seemed that a\r\nvigorous, though necessarily costly attack might have made him master\r\nof the entrenchments, General Willis was acting in perfect accord\r\nwith the spirit of Lord Wolseley’s strategy, for Alison’s brigade of\r\ninfantry had only just arrived from Alexandria at Kassasin, and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief was not yet ready to advance across the desert.\r\nHad the Egyptians been attacked and beaten on the 9th, Wolseley could\r\nnot have followed up the victory, and therefore their defeat would\r\nnot have been the absolutely crushing blow that he hoped to inflict\r\n(and did actually inflict) upon them a few days later. The British\r\ntroops remained facing Tel-el-Kebir for about three hours, and thus\r\nsecured time for a careful reconnaissance of Arabi’s position; then\r\nthey were ordered back to camp. The Egyptian losses were severe, but\r\nthe British casualties were only three men killed, two officers and\r\nseventy-five other ranks wounded. Among the wounded were Captain H.\r\nH. Edwards, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (attached to the XVIIIth) and two\r\nprivate soldiers of the battalion.[244] A subaltern in the Royal\r\nIrish thus recorded the experiences of the second battalion on this\r\noccasion: “Just as we were sitting down to breakfast the bugles\r\nsounded for us to fall in, and a minute or two later the enemy had\r\ngot so close that they began lodging shell in our camp and made it\r\nso hot that the ---- had to clear out sharp. We were out pretty\r\nquick, and were alongside some guns which opened on the enemy and of\r\ncourse drew their fire on us. For about an hour we were in a pretty\r\nwarm corner; shells burst thickly around us, but no one was touched\r\nexcept two men slightly wounded. After a time we got the order to\r\nadvance, and in doing so we got a few rifle-shots among us which\r\ndid not do us any harm. Our men did not fire a shot. As we advanced\r\nthe enemy retreated. We were left to cover the retirement of the\r\nbattalions who had been in the firing line and were relieved at four\r\no’clock in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time the Commander-in-Chief’s preparations were completed;\r\nthe whole of the troops selected for the march across the desert were\r\nconcentrated at Kassasin, and those appointed to hold the lines of\r\ncommunication were at their posts. Lord Wolseley had already formed\r\nhis plan of attack, which he thus described in his despatch of the\r\n16th of September--\r\n\r\n  “The enemy’s position was a strong one; there was no cover of\r\n  any kind in the desert lying between my camp at Kassasin and\r\n  the enemy’s works north of the Canal. These works extended from\r\n  a point on the Canal 1½ miles east of the railway station at\r\n  Tel-el-Kebir for a distance almost due north of about 3½ miles.\r\n  The general character of the ground which forms the northern\r\n  boundary of the valley through which the Ismailia[245] Canal and\r\n  railway run is that of gently undulating and rounded slopes,\r\n  which rise gradually to a fine open plateau from 90 to 100\r\n  feet above the valley. The southern extremity of this plateau\r\n  is about a mile from the railway and is nearly parallel to it.\r\n  To have marched over this plateau upon the enemy’s position by\r\n  daylight our troops would have had to advance over a glacis-like\r\n  slope in full view of the enemy and under the fire of his\r\n  well-served artillery for about five miles. Such an operation\r\n  would have entailed enormous losses from an enemy with men and\r\n  guns well-protected by entrenchments from any artillery fire we\r\n  could have brought to bear upon them. To have turned the enemy’s\r\n  position either by the right or left was an operation that would\r\n  have entailed a very wide turning movement, and therefore a long,\r\n  difficult and fatiguing march, and what is of more importance,\r\n  it would not have accomplished the object I had in view, namely\r\n  to grapple with the enemy at such close quarters that he should\r\n  not be able to shake himself free from our clutches except by\r\n  a general fight of all his army. I wished to make the battle a\r\n  final one; whereas a wide turning movement would probably have\r\n  only forced him to retreat, and would have left him free to have\r\n  moved his troops in good order to some other position farther\r\n  back. My desire was to fight him decisively where he was, in\r\n  the open desert, before he could take up fresh positions more\r\n  difficult of access in the cultivated country in his rear. That\r\n  cultivated country is practically impassable to a regular army,\r\n  being irrigated and cut up in every direction by deep canals. I\r\n  had ascertained by frequent reconnaissance that the enemy did\r\n  not push his outposts far beyond his works at night, and I had\r\n  good reasons for believing that he then kept a very bad look-out.\r\n  These circumstances, and the very great reliance I had in the\r\n  steadiness of our splendid infantry, determined me to resort\r\n  to the extremely difficult operation of a night march, to be\r\n  followed by an attack before daybreak on the enemy’s position.”\r\n\r\nThe field-works at Tel-el-Kebir were not of uniform strength, for\r\nArabi, believing that the British would advance along the Sweet-water\r\ncanal, had devoted himself to the fortification of the right of his\r\nline, where for more than two miles stretched an unbroken series of\r\nbreastworks, with parapets five or six feet high, and ditches varying\r\nfrom eight to twelve feet in width, and from five to nine feet in\r\ndepth. Behind these defences about two miles of interior works had\r\nbeen thrown up, connected with those in front by rifle-pits and\r\ntrenches, and from redoubts built at numerous salients, cross-fire\r\ncould be poured in every direction. Towards the left the works\r\ndwindled in size, and at the extreme northern end of the line, that\r\nwhich, as we shall see, was attacked by the Royal Irish, they were\r\nbut a mere collection of shelter trenches. Arabi had twenty-five\r\nthousand soldiers, six thousand Bedouin irregulars, and about sixty\r\nguns with which to defend these fortifications against the eleven\r\nthousand infantry, two thousand cavalry, and sixty-one guns that the\r\nBritish Commander-in-Chief could bring against him. The remainder of\r\nWolseley’s command was absorbed by the garrisons of Alexandria, Port\r\nSaid, Ismailia, Suez, and other points on the Suez canal, and the\r\nposts on the line of communication between Kassasin and the base at\r\nIsmailia.\r\n\r\nThough the British advance was to be astride the Sweet-water canal,\r\nthe main attack was to be delivered on the works to the north of\r\nit, where the first division was to assault the left, the second\r\ndivision the right of the entrenchments. The cavalry division,\r\nwith its batteries of Royal Horse artillery, was to circle round\r\nthe left of the Egyptian position, threaten its defenders from the\r\nrear, and pursue them when the infantry had driven them from their\r\nentrenchments. On the south of the canal the Indian brigade and the\r\nnaval contingent were to clear the country, capture the villages\r\nwhich had been placed in a state of defence, and seize the important\r\nrailway junction of Zag-a-zig. To the field batteries an interesting\r\n_rôle_ was assigned. It was obvious that in a night march they could\r\nnot discharge the ordinary duty of artillery, that of keeping in\r\ncheck the enemy’s fire so as to render it possible for the attacking\r\ninfantry to advance. But it was almost equally obvious that, if the\r\nforty-two field-guns could be brought up to the entrenchments of\r\nTel-el-Kebir by early dawn, they would be able to pour a crushing\r\nshort-range fire upon the defenders: if either division required\r\nsupport the guns would be at hand to give assistance, and should\r\neither of the infantry attacks fail, the artillery would be ready to\r\nbeat the enemy down behind his works until the attackers were able to\r\nrenew the assault. The seven field batteries therefore were ordered\r\nto march in the interval between the infantry divisions, keeping\r\nlevel with them.\r\n\r\nThe first and second divisions and the field artillery were assembled\r\nafter dark on September 12, on the rising ground known to the Staff\r\nas Ninth Hill, which lay about four miles to the east of Arabi’s\r\nposition. To give the enemy’s scouts and spies no clue to the\r\nintended movements the tents were not struck till sunset, when all\r\nbugle calls ceased. Then the troops were set in motion, the men\r\nmarching light with a hundred rounds of ammunition, rations, and\r\nwater-bottles.[246] As soon as the sun went down the Royal Engineers\r\nbegan to set up on Ninth Hill long lines of posts, running many\r\nhundred yards into the desert, to serve as guides towards the enemy’s\r\nentrenchments. The night was unusually dark, the posts were hard to\r\nfind, and it was not till eleven P.M. that all the units had reached\r\ntheir proper places. Graham’s brigade was on the right of the line,\r\nwith its battalions standing in the following order from the right,\r\nRoyal Irish, York and Lancaster, Royal Marine Light Infantry, Royal\r\nIrish Fusiliers: in the centre were the field-guns: on the left was\r\nAlison’s brigade. H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught’s brigade of Guards\r\nsupported Graham, while in rear of Alison was a small brigade of two\r\nbattalions under Colonel Ashburnham, King’s Royal Rifle Corps.\r\n\r\nAt 1 A.M. on the 13th of September, Graham called together the\r\nofficers commanding the battalions of his brigade and in a low voice\r\ngave them instructions, briefly and to the point: the works of\r\nTel-el-Kebir were to be surprised; the troops were to close upon them\r\nat earliest dawn, and carry them at the point of the bayonet. The\r\nsoldiers were then roused; the orders were explained to them, and in\r\nhalf an hour the greater part of the army was on the march to attack\r\nan enemy of nearly double its numbers, and holding fortifications\r\nabout which, except their strength, little definite was known. The\r\nIndian brigade did not leave its resting-place, south of the Canal,\r\nuntil 2.30 A.M., as to have moved earlier would have run the risk\r\nof giving the alarm to the inhabitants of the belt of cultivated\r\nland through which Macpherson had to march. Throughout the night\r\ntelegraphic communication was kept up between the Indian brigade\r\nand a detachment of Royal Marine artillery, who followed behind\r\nthe second division. It was many years since a British general had\r\nattempted operations at night upon so large a scale. In the Peninsula\r\nWellington’s troops had been thoroughly accustomed to marching and\r\nmanœuvring in darkness, but the art was now almost a lost one, and\r\nWolseley wisely gave great latitude to his divisional generals in the\r\nchoice of the formations in which their commands were to advance;\r\nhe wished the brigades to be so marshalled that no manœuvring would\r\nbe necessary to pass them from the order in which they marched into\r\nthat in which they were to attack, and he suggested, though without\r\npositively commanding, that each brigade should move in line of\r\ncolumns of half battalions at deploying intervals. Neither Alison\r\nnor Graham adopted the suggestion in its entirety. Alison drew up\r\nhis men in line of half battalion columns of double companies, and\r\nnot only marched but attacked in this formation; Graham first moved\r\nin columns of half battalions at deploying intervals, but found it\r\nnecessary to make several changes in formation before he finally\r\nclosed with the enemy. Nothing but the perfect discipline of the\r\ntroops enabled Lord Wolseley and his generals to move this great\r\nmass of men and guns at dead of night, across nearly four miles of\r\nground which it had not been possible thoroughly to reconnoitre,\r\nand to bring it to within a few hundred yards of the fortifications\r\nbefore it was detected by the enemy. No smoking was allowed; the\r\nmen were as silent as the grave; the few orders issued were passed\r\nalong the ranks in a whisper. In the blackness of the night Staff\r\nofficers riding from flank to flank found it impossible to see a\r\ncolumn, when two hundred yards away from it; yet when their ears had\r\ngrown attuned to the silence, which at first appeared crushing and\r\nunnatural, they became aware of a low dull noise, that sound of human\r\nfeet, of horses’ hoofs, of jingling harness, which no forethought\r\ncould prevent. Fortunately throughout the night a little breeze blew\r\nfrom west to east, and thus Arabi’s men, being up-wind, would have\r\nheard nothing if their watch had been vigilant, instead of extremely\r\nnegligent.\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd brigade the precaution of extending a chain of connecting\r\nlinks between the half battalions did not ensure perfect leading\r\nby the guides. Sometimes the half battalions would open out, and\r\nat others close unduly upon each other. These mistakes had to be\r\ncorrected, and each correction took time. At an hour variously\r\nestimated between 3 and 4 A.M.[247] General Willis considered that\r\nthe 2nd brigade had come within range of the Egyptian works. He\r\nwished to rest his men for a moment, and accordingly, after forming\r\nline, ordered a short halt. With the priceless trust of British\r\nsoldiers in their officers, the men immediately dropped on the sand\r\nand fell fast asleep during the few minutes’ repose which they were\r\nallowed. About the same time the Highland brigade was halted to\r\nrefresh the men. As all orders were passed in a low tone from company\r\nto company and from battalion to battalion, this order was not at\r\nonce received by the troops on the outer flanks; they continued to\r\nadvance, but as they remained in touch with the centre they lost\r\ndirection and by the time the command reached them they had wheeled\r\ninwards, though quite unconsciously. Thus the brigade halted not in\r\nline, but in a crescent-shaped formation. When the order was given\r\nto resume the march the flank battalions, quite unaware that they\r\nhad lost direction, moved straight to their front, and soon almost\r\ncrashed into each other. Each thought the other was the enemy, but\r\nby a triumph of discipline, every man waited for orders to fire,\r\nand thus gave time for the officers to discover the mistake. The\r\nbrigade was halted, the companies of direction placed on the true\r\nline of advance, and the remainder of the Highlanders, gradually and\r\nsuccessively drawing back, re-formed upon the proper alignment. This\r\nmistake, which took about twenty-five minutes to correct, is a good\r\nexample of the difficulty of night operations and the necessity of\r\nimplicit obedience to orders.\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest Graham’s brigade again advanced, this time in\r\nline, but the formation was found unsuitable, and was changed to an\r\nadvance by fours from the right of companies. To keep in the proper\r\ndirection was no easy matter, especially as the mass of artillery\r\non the left was steering a few degrees too far to the northward,\r\nand thus continually elbowed the 2nd brigade off the right path: to\r\ncorrect this pressure frequent turns half-left and half-right had\r\nto be made. Suddenly, at about 4.45 A.M., “far away to the left was\r\nheard a tremendous rattle of musketry, mingled with the firing of big\r\nguns, succeeded by ringing and sustained cheers, and”--to quote the\r\nspecial correspondent who, as already mentioned, had attached himself\r\nto the Royal Irish--“we felt sure that the Highland brigade had found\r\nits quest and run into it.” At this moment it became necessary again\r\nto correct a mistake in direction, and “a halt and change of front a\r\nquarter circle to the left were at once ordered.... A rattling fire\r\nof small arms now opened on us from the works, distant about 600\r\nyards.[248] It was still dusk, but the blackness of night had given\r\nplace to a pale darkness, through which the flashes of fire sparkled\r\nwith ceaseless rapidity.”\r\n\r\nBy this time, owing to the difficulty of marching at night over the\r\nfeatureless desert with nothing to steer by but the stars, Lord\r\nWolseley’s force was no longer in line but in echelon from the\r\nleft, and when the Highlanders struck the enemy’s works the head of\r\nGraham’s brigade was probably more than 800 yards from the Egyptians’\r\nentrenchments. As soon as the brigade had formed line the Royal\r\nIrish pushed forward, and were rapidly nearing the position when the\r\nbrigade-major, suddenly appearing on the scene, told Colonel Gregorie\r\nit was General Graham’s wish that he should form the Royal Irish\r\nfor attack. Though it was obvious that the battalion was too close\r\nto the trenches for the evolution to be carried out accurately, the\r\nnecessary orders were given, and C and D companies extended, with\r\nB and E in support, and the remainder in reserve. Then the leading\r\ncompanies swept onwards under a heavy but fortunately ill-directed\r\nfusilade; the supports and reserves closed upon the firing-line, and\r\nwith wild yells and almost without firing a shot, the Royal Irish\r\nswarmed over the shelter trenches at the extreme end of Arabi’s\r\nline, driving before them at the point of the bayonet the Egyptians,\r\nwho slowly and in good order fell back to a second line of works in\r\nrear. The Royal Irish were now enfiladed by a redoubt on their left\r\nflank, but taking no notice of its fire they pressed onwards until,\r\nafter driving the Egyptians from the second line of entrenchments,\r\nthey were peremptorily halted and ordered to re-form their ranks.\r\nWhile this second charge was being delivered, Lieutenant Chichester\r\nmade a gallant effort to storm the redoubt with a few men; but he\r\nand two or three of his followers fell wounded, and it remained in\r\nthe hands of the enemy until the York and Lancaster carried it with\r\na rush. The Marines and the Royal Irish Fusiliers gradually made\r\nthemselves masters of the works in front of them, and the Egyptians,\r\nfalling into confusion, and to a large extent abandoned by their\r\nofficers who were among the first to fly, retired in disorder. When\r\nthey discovered that the British cavalry had swung round the left\r\nof their position and were directly threatening them from the rear,\r\ntheir retreat became a rout. Yet there were many among the rank\r\nand file, especially in the regiments composed of Nubians, who had\r\nshown bravery in the battle, and at the time it was thought that had\r\nthese men been well led they would have been formidable enemies.\r\nThe justice of this, opinion has been proved by the services of the\r\nmodern Egyptian troops in the Soudan, where regiments of Egyptian\r\npeasants and Soudanese blacks, trained and officered by men of the\r\nregular British army, have on many occasions acquitted themselves\r\nexcellently.\r\n\r\nSome interesting episodes have been recorded of the part played\r\nby the Royal Irish in this phase of the engagement. The special\r\ncorrespondent relates that as the battalion was advancing towards\r\nthe first line of trenches two men, mad with excitement, dashed\r\nout of the ranks and rushed towards the enemy. For a moment they\r\ndisappeared, but\r\n\r\n  “presently they were seen by themselves, beyond the first works,\r\n  and in front of the big redoubt, in the very midst of the foe.\r\n  These gallant two! One was on his knee facing south-west;\r\n  apparently he is conscious of having gone beyond support. The\r\n  Egyptians in their trenches and ditches are in front, to right\r\n  and to left of him. He glances back towards where kneels, a few\r\n  yards behind him, his brave companion. But who can save you now,\r\n  rash, gallant young Irishmen! You have turned from the front\r\n  of your regiment and are cut off from all aid. My position on\r\n  horseback enabled me to see the men, who, kneeling, were hid by\r\n  the trenches from their own regiment. I saw an Egyptian officer\r\n  move up behind the left of the leading man, and seizing his arm,\r\n  strike him over the head or shoulder with his sword. A struggle\r\n  ensued, but the smoke of battle hid them from further view. After\r\n  the fight Colonel Gregorie found two dead bodies of his men among\r\n  the others of his regiment in the place described: their names\r\n  were Corporal Devine and Private Milligan.”\r\n\r\nThe good conduct of other soldiers is thus described by Colonel (then\r\nLieutenant) Chichester--\r\n\r\n  “They stood back to back, tackled six Nubians, and accounted for\r\n  them all. I now forget their names, but I was going to recommend\r\n  them for reward, but afterwards heard that they had been killed\r\n  later in the battle. A very brave reservist in my company was\r\n  badly wounded and lay on the ground close to where I had fallen.\r\n  He had eight bullet holes in his body, yet he only died the day\r\n  that our transport full of wounded arrived at Plymouth. When the\r\n  men came to attend him on the battlefield, he said, ‘Don’t mind\r\n  me; look after others, worse hurt.’”\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to the gallant behaviour of this Irishman was the\r\ntreachery of an Egyptian officer who lay injured on ground occupied\r\nby the XVIIIth. One of the men offered him water; he drank it, and\r\nthen suddenly rolled over, snatched up a rifle and shot down one of\r\nthe soldiers who were tending him. Prompt steps were taken to prevent\r\nthis ruffian from doing more mischief!\r\n\r\nAfter pursuing for some distance, Graham halted to re-form his\r\nbrigade in readiness for further action. He had every reason to be\r\nproud of his command, for, as he reported to Lord Wolseley, “the\r\nsteadiness of the advance of the 2nd brigade under what appeared\r\nto be an overwhelming fire of musketry and artillery will remain a\r\nproud remembrance.” As he rode from battalion to battalion he was\r\ngreeted with many cheers, a tribute to the leader who, though a\r\nstern disciplinarian, had ever proved himself mindful of the comfort\r\nof his men, watchful of their safety, and who had now led them to\r\ndecisive victory. By the time the second brigade had re-formed its\r\nranks the troops on the left had also finished their work. The task\r\nset to Alison’s command had proved much harder than that allotted to\r\nGraham’s battalions. Not only were the fortifications which faced\r\nthe Highland brigade far stronger than those attacked by the second\r\ndivision, but when the Highlanders had surmounted them they came\r\nunder a very heavy fire from the inner works. But thanks to the\r\ntimely aid of the guns, which pushed right into the entrenchments,\r\nthe enemy was driven back in wild confusion, and in less than an hour\r\nArabi’s army was shattered as completely as it had been surprised.\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley lost no time in reaping the fruits of his victory. As\r\nsoon as the enemy’s works were in his hands the cavalry were ordered\r\nto continue their pursuit, and to strain every nerve to reach Cairo\r\nbefore Arabi had been able to burn it, as he had threatened to do\r\nif he was defeated; while the Indian brigade, which had completely\r\ndriven the enemy from the cultivated country on the southern bank\r\nof the canal, was to push on to Zag-a-zig, and by occupying it,\r\nprevent the various detachments of Arabi’s troops in the Delta from\r\ncoming to his assistance. Both enterprises were successful. At four\r\no’clock on September 14, the cavalry after a magnificent forced march\r\nbegan to appear before the gates of Cairo, where Arabi, who was one\r\nof the first to quit the entrenchments of Tel-el-Kebir, had taken\r\nrefuge. Without attempting to fight, or to carry out his plan for\r\nthe destruction of the city, he surrendered at once, and with him the\r\ngarrison of ten thousand men. The Indian brigade made itself master\r\nof Zag-a-zig, capturing much rolling stock, in which a great portion\r\nof the infantry was moved up to Cairo. With their arrival the war\r\nwas over, and in ten days’ time every garrison in Egypt had been\r\ndisarmed, and the men set free to resume the avocations of peace.\r\n\r\nNot all the British infantry, however, went on at once to Cairo.\r\nAmong the regiments left at Tel-el-Kebir was the second battalion\r\nof the Royal Irish, who thus had plenty of opportunity to admire\r\nthe fifty-eight guns which had been taken on the 13th. In the\r\nengagement the Egyptians are believed to have lost about two thousand\r\nkilled;[249] of the number of their wounded there is no record, but\r\nseveral hundred were tended by our army doctors, while many uninjured\r\nprisoners were taken, disarmed, and turned adrift. The British\r\ncasualties were nine officers killed and twenty-seven wounded; of the\r\nother ranks forty-eight were killed, three hundred and fifty-five\r\nwounded, and thirty missing--in all, four hundred and sixty-nine.\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Irish the losses were:\r\n\r\n  _Killed_              Captain C. M. Jones (attached from\r\n                          the Connaught Rangers) and three\r\n                          other ranks.\r\n\r\n  _Mortally Wounded_    Four private soldiers.\r\n\r\n  _Wounded_             Lieutenant A. G. Chichester and Lieutenant\r\n                          H. H. Drummond-Wolff\r\n                          (attached from the Royal Fusiliers)\r\n                          and fourteen other ranks.[250]\r\n\r\nAfter a week at Tel-el-Kebir the Royal Irish were moved by train to\r\nCairo, where they were quartered in a barrack, the filth of which was\r\nso great that to this day the remembrance stinks in the nostrils of\r\nthose who occupied it. The duty was heavy; there was much sickness\r\namong all ranks, and beyond ceremonial parades in honour of the\r\nreturn of the Khedive to the capital in which he had been reinstated\r\nby British bayonets, nothing of interest occurred during the three\r\nweeks the battalion spent in Cairo except a great fire, in the\r\nsuppression of which it was employed. Lieutenant W. R. B. Doran (now\r\nColonel Doran, C.B., D.S.O.), in a letter written at the time, thus\r\ndescribed the part played on this occasion by the Royal Irish, who\r\nwere fortunate to escape without any of the casualties which occurred\r\namong other corps--\r\n\r\n  “On the 29th of September we were startled by a tremendous bang,\r\n  followed by what sounded like a succession of cannon-shots. After\r\n  an interval there was another great explosion, more cannon-shots,\r\n  and then a rattle of musketry. We thought at first it was some\r\n  kind of plot. It turned out that a lot of trucks full of powder,\r\n  unexploded shells, and small-arm ammunition had been set on fire\r\n  by another train containing hay. How the hay was set on fire no\r\n  one has yet found out. About 6.30 P.M. we were turned out in a\r\n  great hurry, and went to the railway station, to stop all traffic\r\n  in the streets in the neighbourhood, and to prevent the scum\r\n  from beginning to loot; they had just begun, but they got such\r\n  ‘toco’ from the ‘Tommies’ that they soon stopped their little\r\n  games. We remained guarding the streets till nearly 1 A.M., when\r\n  we were relieved and began, as we thought, to march home, but\r\n  were grievously disappointed, as before we had gone half a mile\r\n  we were halted in a square and told to lie down and go to sleep\r\n  in the road. I was rather hungry, as I had not quite finished my\r\n  dinner when the order to fall in came, so I managed to get a sort\r\n  of penny bun from one of our captains, half of which I ate; the\r\n  other half I put under my head and went to sleep on the hardest\r\n  bed and strangest pillow I have ever had!”\r\n\r\nThe battalion was sent to Alexandria[251] on October 11, and a month\r\nlater Lieutenant-Colonel Gregorie, after serving his full time in\r\ncommand, was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. E. Dawson. On\r\nFebruary 1, 1883, the medals with clasps for Tel-el-Kebir were\r\npresented to the Royal Irish on the racecourse of Alexandria by a\r\nveteran soldier, Field-Marshal Lord Napier of Magdala, G.C.B., and a\r\nfew days later the battalion, which to the great satisfaction of all\r\nranks was not included in the 10,000 troops left to hold Egypt for\r\nthe Khedive, sailed for Malta, and after remaining there for three\r\nmonths, landed at Plymouth at the end of May, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe regiment received permission to add to its battle honours the\r\nwords “Egypt 1882” and “Tel-el-Kebir.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel C. F. Gregorie was appointed a Companion of the\r\nOrder of the Bath; Major G. W. N. Rogers and Captain J. H. Daubeney\r\neach received a step in brevet rank; Quartermaster and Honorary\r\nCaptain T. Hamilton was made an Honorary Major; Lieutenant A. G.\r\nChichester and Sergeant E. O’Donnell were mentioned in despatches.\r\nThe following officers were permitted to accept and wear decorations\r\nawarded by the Sultan, viz.: Lieutenant-Colonel Gregorie, the\r\nMedjidie (3rd class); Major Rogers, the Osmanieh (4th class); Captain\r\nDaubeney, Medjidie (4th class); and Lieutenant Chichester, Medjidie\r\n(5th class), and all ranks were presented by the Egyptian government\r\nwith a decoration known as the Khedive’s Star.\r\n\r\nTwo officers attached to the second battalion--Captain H. H. Edwards,\r\nRoyal Welsh Fusiliers, and Lieutenant H. H. Drummond-Wolff, Royal\r\nFusiliers, were also mentioned in despatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTALION.\r\n\r\n1884-1885.\r\n\r\nTHE NILE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of England’s armed intervention in Egypt in 1882, the\r\nKhedive’s authority extended nominally far beyond the limits of the\r\nprovince which Mahomet Ali had wrested from the Sublime Porte. The\r\nfounder of the Egyptian dynasty, not satisfied with fighting his\r\nSuzerain the Sultan in Syria, had pushed armies up the Nile into\r\nthe heart of the Soudan, or country of the Blacks, a no-man’s land\r\nwhich stretched from Wadi Halfa, the southern boundary of Egypt, to\r\nthe Great Lakes far beyond the equator. This region had no form of\r\ngovernment; its inhabitants were oppressed by Arab slave-hunters;\r\nits condition was pitiable in the extreme. Mahomet Ali gradually\r\nconquered every tribe in the Nile valley up to the junction of the\r\nWhite and Blue Niles, where he built Khartoum, and thrust forward\r\noutposts in every direction from the capital of his new dominions,\r\nwhich was about a thousand miles south of Cairo. The country thus\r\nannexed became known as the Egyptian Soudan, and extended from the\r\nshore of the Red Sea to the western frontier of Kordofan; it was\r\nabout the size of France and Germany put together, and its population\r\nin 1883 was estimated at fourteen millions of mixed breed, the\r\ndescendants of the aboriginal negroes and the Arabs who overran\r\nthe country early in the Mohammedan era. This blend had produced a\r\nrace possessing the outward characteristics and mental attributes\r\nof the Arab, combined with the endurance and brute courage of the\r\nNegro.[252] After anarchy such as had prevailed in the Soudan,\r\nalmost any form of government might have been expected to improve\r\nthe condition of the country; but in this respect Egyptian rule\r\ncompletely failed. Taxation was heavy; extortion was the rule,\r\nrather than the exception, and slave-hunting, with all its attendant\r\nhorrors, was not suppressed; indeed, thanks to the connivance of the\r\nofficials, who were virtually in partnership with the slave-dealers,\r\nit so greatly increased that the country was rapidly becoming\r\ndepopulated, when in 1869, the pressure of British public opinion\r\ncompelled the Khedive to institute reforms in the administration,\r\nand to appoint an Englishman, Sir Samuel Baker, as Governor-General\r\nof the Equatorial provinces, which stretched from Khartoum to the\r\nGreat Lakes. Five years later Baker was succeeded by General (then\r\nColonel) Charles George Gordon, who held the post till 1879. Though\r\nboth accomplished much towards the establishment of better government\r\nand the suppression of slave-hunting, their efforts were cramped\r\nand thwarted by the officials at Cairo and at Khartoum, who were\r\nnaturally disinclined to lose the enormous profits they derived from\r\nthe trade in slaves. A country so mercilessly treated only needed a\r\nleader to turn upon its oppressors, and in 1881, such a leader arose\r\nin the Soudan. A prophecy had long been current among Mohammedans\r\nthat about this time a “Mahdi” would appear and convert the whole\r\nworld to the true faith, and of this prophecy a religious adventurer,\r\nnamed Mohammed Ahmed, availed himself to the uttermost. He proclaimed\r\nhimself the Mahdi whose advent had been predicted, and announced that\r\nas soon as the Soudan had joined his cause he would march on Egypt,\r\ndestroying all who opposed him, and convert the whole world to Islam.\r\nSuch was the spiritual part of his programme, carefully prepared\r\nto rouse the fanaticism latent in every Mohammedan; the temporal\r\nadvantages he offered to his followers were universal equality and\r\ncommunity of goods. Although denounced as an impostor by the educated\r\nMussulmans, who probably regarded his socialistic propaganda with\r\nmisgivings, he rapidly gained a great following, and obtained several\r\nsuccesses over the Egyptian garrisons, which were at this time in a\r\nwretched condition. The troops had not been paid for many months,\r\nin some cases even for years: the soldiers were undrilled, their\r\nofficers incompetent to drill them: the loyalty of all ranks was as\r\ndoubtful as their courage. To stiffen this unpromising material,\r\nseveral Englishmen in the service of Egypt were sent to Khartoum;\r\namong them was Hicks Pasha, at one time an officer in the Indian\r\narmy, now the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Khedive’s\r\ntroops in the Soudan.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1883, Hicks, acting under the orders of the Egyptian\r\ngovernment, led an expedition into the depths of Kordofan, where the\r\nMahdi had retired to organise the tribesmen, from thirty to sixty\r\nthousand strong, whom his recent victories had attracted to his\r\nstandard. Hicks commanded about 11,000 weakly and ill-fed men, of\r\nwhom many were so unwilling to be soldiers that to prevent desertion\r\nthey had to be sent up the Nile in chains. His artillery consisted of\r\nthirty-six Krupp, Nordenfelt, and mountain guns, and his transport\r\nwas supplied by six thousand horses and camels. The whole of the\r\nEgyptian troops were thoroughly out of heart; they were aware that\r\nthey were about to march into a country of which little was known\r\nexcept that it was almost waterless, and that they would encounter\r\nhordes of desperate and ruthless fanatics. As the men filed out of\r\nKhartoum they were in floods of tears. The fate of such an army\r\nmay easily be imagined: on the 5th of November it was surprised by\r\nthe Mahdi with 40,000 of his followers, and cut to pieces, near El\r\nObeid in Kordofan.[253] Hicks and the other Europeans died fighting\r\ndauntlessly to the last; the Egyptians allowed themselves to be\r\nbutchered almost without resistance: three hundred were given\r\nquarter, only to become the slaves of the victors, into whose hands\r\npassed the guns, much ammunition, thousands of rifles, and all\r\nthe transport animals. One man alone escaped to bring the news to\r\nKhartoum. Yet so little was the importance of the Mahdist movement\r\nappreciated by the English government that at the very time Hicks’s\r\ncolumn was being destroyed in Kordofan, Mr Gladstone was urging the\r\nreduction of the British army of occupation in Egypt. When Hicks’s\r\nfate became known in Cairo the situation grew very complicated. The\r\nCabinet in London, afraid of being drawn into armed intervention\r\nin the Soudan, had persistently assumed an attitude of aloofness\r\non the subject of Hicks’s operations, and, affecting to ignore the\r\nfact that Britain was virtually, though not officially, mistress in\r\nEgypt, and that a word from her representative at Cairo, Lord Cromer\r\n(then Sir Evelyn Baring), would have stopped the expedition, declined\r\nall responsibility on the ground that it had been undertaken solely\r\non the authority of the Egyptian government. The annihilation of\r\nHicks’s army had placed Khartoum in a position of great danger: only\r\ntwo thousand troops were left to man the four miles of earthworks\r\nby which the town was ringed, and its communications with Cairo\r\nand Suakim were seriously threatened. The generals in command of\r\nthe British army at Cairo admitted that, if the Mahdi advanced\r\non Khartoum, it would be impossible to hold it in its existing\r\ncondition, and that in all probability the whole valley of the Nile,\r\nas far south as Wadi Halfa, would be lost to Egypt. Alarmed at the\r\ncrushing blow which had befallen him, and at the consequences likely\r\nto follow it, the Khedive begged that British troops might be sent to\r\nthe Soudan, or, if these should not be forthcoming, that a contingent\r\nof Turks might be imported to hold Khartoum. Our government refused\r\nto move a single soldier to the Soudan, but had no objection to the\r\nemployment of a Turkish force to garrison Khartoum, provided that no\r\nexpense was thereby thrown upon the Egyptian Treasury. They, however,\r\nadvised Tewfik to abandon all territory south of Assouan, softening\r\nthe blow by the promise that England would defend not only Egypt\r\nproper, but also the ports of the Red Sea against the Mahdists. To\r\nthis wholesale dismemberment of his dominions the Khedive demurred,\r\nand again suggested a Turkish occupation of the Soudan, whereupon\r\nEngland sternly replied that if the Egyptian ministers would not\r\ncarry out the evacuation of the Soudan they would have to make room\r\nfor Englishmen, ready to enforce her policy. The Khedive thereupon\r\nwithdrew his opposition, and agreed that the whole of the Soudan,\r\nexcept the port of Suakim, should be abandoned to its fate. During\r\nthese negotiations the situation at Khartoum had become so serious\r\nthat the senior European officer there, in reporting that it would\r\nbe impossible to hold the town against the whole population of the\r\nSoudan, which had now thrown in its lot with the Mahdi, urged that\r\nimmediate orders should be given for a withdrawal down the river. The\r\nquestion next arose--who was to effect the withdrawal, not only of\r\nthe troops, but also of the officials, traders, and other members of\r\nthe civil army of occupation in the Soudan?\r\n\r\nThe English ministers then bethought themselves of General Gordon,\r\none of the most remarkable characters of the nineteenth century.\r\nHis career had been a strange and eventful one. After serving with\r\ndistinction as a Royal Engineer in the Crimea, the chances of\r\nwar carried him to the Far East where he played his part in the\r\nAnglo-French expedition to China. When the object of the campaign\r\nwas accomplished, peace was signed with the Emperor of China, but\r\nthe end of the war found some of the most fertile provinces of the\r\nCelestial Empire in the hands of great hordes of insurgents, with\r\nwhom the Chinese authorities were wholly unable to cope. Gordon\r\nwas lent to the Emperor to command a force of Chinamen, raised by\r\nhimself and officered by adventurers of mixed nationality. With a\r\nrare combination of military talent and personal courage, readiness\r\nto assume responsibility, power of influencing his subordinates, and\r\ncomplete absence of self-seeking, he welded his unpromising material\r\ninto good soldiers, with whom he stormed many walled towns and won\r\nbattles innumerable against vastly superior numbers. After a long\r\nstruggle, in which his men earned the title of “the ever-victorious\r\narmy,” he completely crushed the rebels; and then, disbanding the\r\ntroops who had learned to look upon him as invincible, he returned\r\nto Europe with the justly earned reputation of a born leader of men.\r\nDuring his five years’ sojourn in the Soudan Gordon had acquired\r\ngreat influence over its inhabitants. The fighting men had learned\r\nto follow, the slave-hunters to fear him: the traders respected his\r\nstern and evenhanded justice: all classes knew that his word, once\r\npledged, was never broken, and that his orders must be obeyed to the\r\nletter. At a few hours’ notice, Gordon was sent to Egypt to secure\r\nthe retreat of the garrison of Khartoum and of the thousands of\r\ncivilians who would probably wish to accompany it, and also to effect\r\nthe evacuation of the remainder of the Soudan. For this enormous\r\ntask he was allowed one Staff officer, Colonel D. Stewart,[254] 11th\r\nHussars, with whom he reached Khartoum on February 18, 1884.\r\n\r\nWhile Gordon was on his way up the Nile, the tide of war was setting\r\nstrongly against the Egyptians in the eastern Soudan, where a wing of\r\nthe Mahdi’s army was commanded by Osman Digna, an ex-slave dealer who\r\nhad been ruined by the capture of his _dhows_ by British cruisers.\r\nOsman Digna had stormed several fortified towns and villages, held\r\nby the Khedive as outposts round Suakim, and had cut to pieces\r\ncolumns of Egyptian troops sent at various times to the relief of\r\nthe garrisons scattered throughout the district. Suakim itself was\r\nthreatened, and the ships of war then lying off the port landed\r\nbluejackets and Marines for its protection, while Major-General Sir\r\nGerald Graham was sent from Cairo to reinforce them with 4000 British\r\ntroops. There were two sharp engagements at El-Teb (February 29)\r\nand Tamai (March 13), in which Osman Digna fought with magnificent\r\ncourage, but sustained such heavy losses that his power for evil\r\nappeared sufficiently diminished to warrant the withdrawal of the\r\nBritish soldiers from the eastern Soudan.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place round Suakim, things were\r\ngoing badly with Gordon at Khartoum, and though direct telegraphic\r\ncommunication with him was cut off about a month after his arrival,\r\nthe news which reached Cairo showed that his position was becoming\r\none of considerable danger. In April, the Secretary of State for\r\nWar began to realise that it might become necessary to send an\r\nexpedition to rescue Gordon, and called upon Lord Wolseley for a\r\nplan of campaign. In his reply Wolseley showed that Khartoum could\r\nonly be approached by the caravan roads converging on Berber from\r\nthe Red Sea or by the valley of the Nile, and strongly advocated\r\nthe latter route. He proposed to move the dismounted troops up the\r\nriver in boats, and after pointing out that Gordon’s supplies would\r\nnot permit him to hold Khartoum later than the 15th of November,\r\nurged that immediate preparations should be made to meet possible\r\ncontingencies. For several months government took little action\r\nbeyond making inquiries about the track across the desert from Suakim\r\nto Berber, and sending naval officers up the Nile to report whether\r\nLord Wolseley’s scheme was practicable. These officers reported\r\nagainst it, and Sir F. C. A. Stephenson, the General commanding the\r\nBritish troops in Egypt, agreed with their views. On the other hand,\r\na committee composed of three officers who had taken part in the Red\r\nRiver expedition in Canada emphatically expressed their opinion that\r\nWolseley’s plan was perfectly feasible, and pointed out that the\r\nnaval objections to it were based on the assumption that steamers of\r\nconsiderable size, and boats up to 40 tons burden would be required,\r\nwhereas the army only asked for whale-boats, which could be used at\r\nany state of the Nile.\r\n\r\nWhile these discussions were going on, the tide of Mahdism steadily\r\nflowed northwards. To meet a possible attack upon Egypt proper, the\r\nbulk of the Khedive’s army, then in process of reorganisation by\r\nBritish officers, was hurried to Assouan, where it was strengthened\r\nby English battalions; the Nile was patrolled by steamers manned\r\nby the navy; and irregular levies of Bedouins, also commanded by\r\nBritish officers, were pushed up the river into Dongola, the most\r\nsouthern portion of the Egyptian dominions in which the authority of\r\nthe Khedive was still recognised. Dongola was ruled by a Mudir who,\r\nthough originally in sympathy with the Mahdi, had been won back by\r\ngolden arguments to the cause of his Suzerain. In the course of the\r\nsummer his territory was attacked; it was considered necessary to\r\nhelp him with British bayonets, and the 1st battalion of the Royal\r\nSussex regiment was moved southwards from Assouan. On the 8th of\r\nAugust, only eight days before the Royal Sussex reached the town of\r\nDongola, a vote of credit was obtained from the House of Commons to\r\ncover the expense of sending troops to the assistance of the Mudir;\r\nbut though by this vote government definitely committed itself to\r\nthe Nile route, and therefore to the use of small boats, it was not\r\nuntil the 12th that official sanction was given for the construction\r\nof these craft. Four hundred were then ordered, and in a few days\r\nthe number was doubled. The boats were to carry twelve men with\r\ntheir equipment, ammunition, and rations; to be suitable alike for\r\nrowing, sailing before a wind, and tracking (_i.e._, being hauled up\r\nstream from the bank), for ascending and descending rapids, and for\r\npassing over shallow and rocky places in the river: to be as light\r\nas possible, yet strong enough to be dragged over short stretches\r\nof ground to avoid cataracts; and to be 32 feet in length, 6 feet\r\n9 inches in breadth, and only 2 feet 6 inches in depth. The first\r\nconsignment reached Alexandria on September 22, the last on October\r\n18, 1884.\r\n\r\nIt had not been proposed to employ Lord Wolseley in the expedition,\r\nbut on August 26, he was appointed to command the troops upon the\r\nNile. He reached Cairo on September 9, when there were actually in\r\nEgypt, or on their way thither, a regiment of cavalry, one battery\r\nof Royal Horse artillery, one of Royal Field artillery, one camel\r\nbattery of mountain guns, and two garrison batteries; four companies\r\nof Royal Engineers, one of which was at Suakim; a battalion of\r\nmounted infantry, 423 strong; and thirteen and a half battalions of\r\ninfantry--in all, nearly 11,000 officers and men, among whom were the\r\nfirst battalion of the Royal Irish regiment. Not all these troops,\r\nhowever, were available for the actual operations at Khartoum when\r\nthat far-distant goal should be approached. The garrisons of Cairo\r\nand Alexandria absorbed four and a half battalions of infantry, a\r\nsquadron of cavalry, and all the artillery except the mountain guns.\r\nThough the Egyptian army held the line of communication from Cairo\r\nto Hannek, it was considered necessary to strengthen this section\r\nwith a British battalion, while to secure the Nile between Hannek and\r\nBerber, at least five battalions would be required. Lord Wolseley\r\naimed at placing about 5400 men in line at Shendi, a place on the\r\nriver about 100 miles south of Berber, and the same distance to the\r\nnorthward of Khartoum, and after making allowance for the inevitable\r\nwastage of troops in an expedition such as he was to conduct, and\r\nfor the possibility that he might have to send part of his column on\r\na sudden dash across the desert, he asked the War Office to supply\r\nhim with eleven hundred more men, volunteers from regular regiments\r\nat home, to be turned into “camelry”--_i.e._, infantry mounted upon\r\ncamels. The request was granted, and these reinforcements arrived in\r\ntime to reap a large share of the honours of the campaign.\r\n\r\nBefore any troops could be moved to Shendi, through a country from\r\nwhich little or no food could be obtained, it was necessary to form\r\nan advanced base as high up the river as possible, where stores of\r\nall kinds were to be collected before the main body began to arrive\r\nfrom Cairo. It was also necessary to establish along the line of\r\ncommunication on the river a chain of intermediate depôts, from\r\nwhich the troops would draw rations and thus preserve intact the\r\ncargo of stores with which each whale-boat was to be freighted.\r\nKorti was selected for the advanced base, and there, when the first\r\nthousand miles of its journey from the sea was accomplished, the\r\nexpeditionary force was to effect its preliminary concentration.[255]\r\nAs far as Wadi Halfa, about 750 miles above Cairo, the navigation of\r\nthe Nile presents no great difficulties, and every available river\r\nsteamer and river boat was pressed into the service. But above Wadi\r\nHalfa a formidable series of cataracts, or rapids as they should\r\nmore accurately be termed, proved fatal to so many of the native\r\ncraft that the transport of stores to the higher reaches had almost\r\nentirely to be carried out by the whale-boats. It was not until the\r\n1st of November that a sufficient quantity of supplies had been sent\r\nup the river to warrant Lord Wolseley in moving the main body of his\r\ninfantry. Then as speedily as possible each corps was despatched\r\nin turn on its journey southward. Towards the end of December the\r\nfirst battalion of infantry reached Korti, where the camelry, who\r\nhad marched along the banks of the Nile, were beginning to assemble;\r\nin about four weeks more the last regiments arrived, and by the\r\nend of January the preliminary concentration had been successfully\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the second battalion was winning fresh honours for the regiment\r\nat Tel-el-Kebir, the first battalion was in India. It was stationed\r\nat Meerut in August, 1884, when the welcome order was received to\r\nstart for Egypt forthwith on active service. In high spirits at the\r\nprospect of a campaign, all ranks worked with a will; by the 20th\r\nthe preparations were finished, and the Royal Irish, after a very\r\nhot railway journey, embarked at Bombay on the 29th, and three weeks\r\nlater arrived at Cairo in magnificent order. They are described by an\r\nofficer who was then serving with the regiment--\r\n\r\n  “When the 1st battalion Royal Irish landed in Egypt in 1884, it\r\n  was, bar none, the finest battalion I have ever seen, both in\r\n  physique and in general appearance. Under Colonel M. MacGregor\r\n  they were considered to be the best dressed regiment in India,\r\n  and since his departure they had lived up to their reputation.\r\n  In this respect they presented a very marked contrast to many\r\n  of the battalions in Egypt, who were dressed in a very hideous\r\n  grey serge very similar to that worn by convicts, which was\r\n  worn apparently exactly as it had been issued from store. Their\r\n  physique was equally distinguishable from the Corps who had\r\n  lately arrived from home. The average service was (if I remember\r\n  right) about seven years, and the average height, taken from the\r\n  annual return prepared at Wady Halfa, was 5.7¾, and the chest\r\n  measurement was 38″. While we were at Cairo a gymkhana was held\r\n  at Gezireh, where one of the events was a tug-of-war open to\r\n  all troops in garrison. The Royal Garrison artillery for some\r\n  time past had invariably won this contest: so invincible were\r\n  they considered that no infantry regiments would compete against\r\n  them, and they used to take the prize on every occasion with a\r\n  ‘walk-over.’ On the arrival of the Royal Irish, we determined to\r\n  enter our team, which had been practically unbeaten in India. On\r\n  the day of the gymkhana the R.G.A. expected to have another ‘walk\r\n  over,’ when to their surprise and to that of the spectators (we\r\n  had kept the fact dark that we intended to enter a team), ten\r\n  strapping Royal Irishmen, in jerseys of the regimental colours,\r\n  stepped out on to the ground. The gunners were so unprepared\r\n  for this that they hadn’t even taken the trouble to be suitably\r\n  dressed for a tug-of-war. So confident were they of beating all\r\n  comers that instead of the usual line they had arranged an open\r\n  ditch filled with water, across which the opposing teams had to\r\n  pull. It was not many minutes before the two leading gunners were\r\n  in the water, and the rest, to save themselves a ducking, had to\r\n  let go the rope!”\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were almost the last troops to leave lower Egypt; but\r\nat length the long-expected order reached them, and on the evening\r\nof November 12, 1884, they entrained for Assiut, the farthest point\r\nto which the railway ran up the Nile. The marching-out state showed\r\na strength of seven hundred and forty-six officers and men.[256]\r\n\r\nNext morning, after a journey of 229 miles, the Royal Irish arrived\r\nat Assiut, and at once exchanged the train for the barges in which\r\nthey were to be towed 318 miles to Assouan, at the foot of the First\r\nCataract. The men were packed into four barges, in each of which a\r\nsubaltern was on duty for twenty-four hours at a time; the remainder\r\nof the officers were divided among the steamers and a _dahabiah_.\r\n“That night the halt was not sounded till 10 o’clock, when,” wrote\r\na young officer of the Royal Irish, “a nice job we had of it. Our\r\nsteamers did not keep together, so that we had to go along the bank\r\nfor about a mile in the dark, and draw rations for the next day, and\r\nvery ticklish work it was, as the path was quite close to the river\r\nand bits of the bank were continually falling in.” Progress was slow,\r\nfor both barges and tugs occasionally ran on to sandbanks, and it was\r\nnot until November 24, that the flotilla, which had been joined by\r\nthe 2nd battalion, Royal West Kent regiment, reached its destination.\r\nAs the barges could not pass the rapids the Royal Irish landed,\r\nand spent an unhappy day in the belief that they were to remain at\r\nAssouan. They had been ordered to encamp, and some of the officers\r\nwere on their way to select the ground, when a tremendous roar of\r\ncheers and Irish yells told them the battalion had received good\r\nnews; shortly afterwards a staff-officer informed them that they were\r\nto proceed up the river forthwith, and after a short journey in the\r\nrailway turning the rapids, the Royal Irish re-embarked at Shellal,\r\nthis time in the sailing-boats or _dahabiahs_ in which the traffic\r\nof the Nile from time immemorial has been carried on. The next stage\r\n(210 miles) in the voyage was to Wadi Halfa, the frontier town of\r\nEgypt, and the most southern point which Roman legions had occupied\r\nin the valley of the Nile. Here a long stretch of rapids called the\r\nSecond Cataract barred the passage of all local craft at that time\r\nof year, and the troops landed and went into camp, where owing to a\r\nblock on the line of communication the battalion was detained for\r\nmore than a fortnight. This halt was by no means a restful one, for\r\nthe fatigues were incessant, but some of the officers found time to\r\nreconnoitre the nearest of the rapids through which they were about\r\nto pass, and reported that a task awaited the XVIIIth as arduous in\r\nits way as any that had fallen to the lot of the regiment during\r\nthe two centuries of its existence. The Second Cataract, like that\r\nat Assouan, is turned by a line of railway thirty-three miles in\r\nlength, which ended at Gemai, where, in an improvised dockyard, the\r\nwhale-boats lay waiting for the Royal Irish. By December 16, the line\r\nof communication was again clear, and the first detachment--B and E\r\ncompanies under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wray--were sent by rail\r\nto Gemai, where they took possession of their “whalers,” and many\r\nstores. When these were packed the flotilla started in single file,\r\nand sometimes sailing, sometimes rowing (with many different strokes\r\nand styles), worked up a smooth stretch of river till nightfall,\r\nwhen the boats were tied up to the bank, and the crews disembarked\r\nand pitched their camps. Next morning the detachment reached Sarras,\r\nwhere the remainder of the stores were issued. Each whaler carried\r\nthe arms, ammunition, tents, and camp equipage of her crew, materials\r\nfor repairing any damage she might sustain on the voyage, and cases\r\ncontaining a hundred days’ rations for twelve men. These cases were\r\nnot to be opened, but were to be delivered intact at the point of\r\nconcentration, the supplies for current use being drawn at the\r\nvarious posts on the line of communication. By the time the whole of\r\nthe freight (about four tons) was on board the boats, the load of\r\nboxes at stem and stern rose so high above the gunwales that the men\r\nat the oars were half-hidden behind the high-piled cargoes.\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley had always attributed much of the success of the\r\nlittle Red River expedition to the skill of the boatmen, or\r\n_voyageurs_ who navigated his canoes over the waterways of Canada.\r\nWith some difficulty he induced the British government to sanction\r\nthe enrolment of a corps of Canadian boatmen for the much larger\r\nexpedition of 1884; nearly four hundred officers and men were\r\nraised, many of whom proved themselves as valuable on the Nile as\r\ntheir predecessors had been on the rivers of Ontario and Manitoba.\r\nThese _voyageurs_ joined the whalers at Sarras: they were placed in\r\ncharge of the actual handling of the boats, but, except as watermen,\r\nthey had no authority. The flotilla as a whole was in charge of the\r\nregimental officers, who were distributed among the whalers, but in\r\nevery company many boats were necessarily commanded by sergeants and\r\neven by corporals. In most cases the non-commissioned officers were\r\nas ignorant of boat work as their men, and with their crews had to\r\nlearn by experience the use of oars and sails, the employment of\r\npoles to prevent the whalers from being dashed against the rocks, and\r\nthe art of tracking. Even the best of the _voyageurs_, though experts\r\nin other branches of boatmanship, knew nothing of sails, which\r\nwere not used in the navigation of the rivers with which they were\r\nfamiliar. In the forenoon of December 18, B and E companies pushed\r\noff from Sarras, followed by the remainder of the battalion, less G\r\ncompany, which next day brought up the rear. Thus the whole battalion\r\nwas now afloat, engaged in a ceaseless struggle with the rapids of\r\nthe Nile, and greatly handicapped by want of _voyageurs_, of whom\r\nthe supply had run so short that instead of a couple of Canadians\r\nbeing posted to each boat, as had been the case with the corps first\r\nup the river, only two could now be allotted to each company of the\r\nRoyal Irish. The difficulties encountered, as will be seen, were\r\nenormous, but the first battalion of the Royal Irish overcame them\r\nwith brilliant success, and made the passage up the river faster\r\nthan any other corps in the expeditionary force. In order to “get\r\nthe last ounce” of work out of his troops, Lord Wolseley appealed\r\nto both the sporting and the patriotic instincts of his soldiers by\r\noffering a prize of £100 to the non-commissioned officers and men of\r\nthe battalion which made the fastest run with the fewest accidents\r\nfrom Sarras to Debbeh, and by promising that the winning corps should\r\nbe selected for the post of honour in the farther advance towards\r\nKhartoum. The money prize was awarded to the Royal Irish, who thus\r\nwon the right to share in the hardships of the march across the\r\ndesert to Metemmeh. Before that march is described, some account\r\nmust be given of the portion of the Nile up which the Royal Irish\r\nhad to force their way before they could hope to strike a blow for\r\nthe relief of Gordon. For eighty miles above Sarras the river runs\r\nthrough a wild and barren region known as Batn-el-Hájar or the\r\nWomb of Rocks, of which the official historian gives the following\r\ndescription:--\r\n\r\n  “After leaving Sarras the first serious obstacle to navigation\r\n  is the cataract of Semneh, the foot of which is reached after\r\n  an eleven miles’ pull against a smooth, swift current running\r\n  between high rocky banks. Then come ten miles of swifter-flowing\r\n  water, against which, however, with the help of a moderate\r\n  breeze, it is possible to proceed with the help of the track\r\n  lines. At the head of this rapid is the great ‘Gate of Semneh,’\r\n  a narrow gorge, between two rocky cliffs, partly blocked by two\r\n  islands about equi-distant from the shores and from each other.\r\n  Through the three passages thus formed the whole pent-up volume\r\n  of the Nile rushes as through a sluice-gate. Here the boats have\r\n  to be unloaded, and their cargoes, package by package, carried\r\n  for half a mile over the rocks and deposited near smooth water\r\n  above the cataract. Then the track lines are passed round the\r\n  rocks, and two or three boats’ crews manning one line, each boat\r\n  is in turn hauled by main force up the water slide and run in\r\n  opposite its cargo on the beach.\r\n\r\n  “For the next sixteen miles the course of the river is unimpeded\r\n  by any serious obstacle, still for every yard the current runs as\r\n  strong as the Thames in flood, on every side the basalt mountains\r\n  radiate their heat, and everywhere the sunken rocks lie in\r\n  wait for the unwary steersman. At the end of this distance the\r\n  cataract of Ambako is reached, a very different piece of water to\r\n  that of Semneh. At the latter spot an obstacle to navigation was\r\n  formed by the volume of the Nile being pent into a narrow gorge;\r\n  at Ambako the same effect is produced by a broad expanse of river\r\n  being choked by an innumerable mass of reefs and islets. At full\r\n  high Nile, when the lower rocks are buried deep beneath the\r\n  surface, the cataract is not a formidable one; but as the river\r\n  falls and reef after reef makes its appearance, the difficulties\r\n  of navigation increase, until at low Nile the cataract has become\r\n  impassable for the larger native craft, and is a grave source of\r\n  difficulty even to the buoyant English whalers.\r\n\r\n  “Here every means of propulsion has to be employed. At one moment\r\n  the whalers, under the lee of some islet, may be paddled gently\r\n  up a narrow lane of almost stagnant water. Then, as the shelter\r\n  of the rock is lost, though its crew pull for dear life, it is\r\n  carried back some hundreds of yards until a point of vantage is\r\n  reached near the shore. Next the track line is got out, and step\r\n  by step the boat is hauled round a projecting point by a treble\r\n  boat’s crew. Now a fresh breeze and a clear reach of moderate\r\n  water make it just possible to gain a few hundred yards by making\r\n  the very most of sails and oars; then a bit of shelving shore\r\n  is met with, along which good progress may be made by half the\r\n  crew tracking, while the remainder stay on board and use their\r\n  punt-poles. At length, by dint of perseverance, the five miles of\r\n  rapid are surmounted in twice as many hours of incessant labour,\r\n  and another eight miles of open water are entered on.”[257]\r\n\r\nThough no two cataracts are exactly alike, their general features\r\nare much the same, and therefore it is enough merely to mention\r\nthe others passed by the XVIIIth. Above the rapids of Ambako came\r\nthe cataract of Tanjur, which, though only two miles and a half\r\nlong, usually took the boats a whole day to ascend, and fifteen\r\nmiles higher up was another rapid, nearly as troublesome as that\r\nof Semneh. This was succeeded by ten miles of smooth water running\r\nbetween hills crowned with ruins, relics of a nation so ancient that\r\nits very name has been forgotten. Then followed the cataract of\r\nDal, round which stores had to be carried for three or four miles\r\nby hand; these rapids once passed, the boats entered a long reach\r\nof calm but swift-running water 100 miles in length, at the head of\r\nwhich two more cataracts, those of Kaiber[258] and Hannek, had to\r\nbe surmounted. From Hannek to Korti the navigation of the Nile was\r\nfairly easy.\r\n\r\nThe record of the forty days spent by the battalion between Sarras\r\nand Korti is one of unceasing toil. The Royal Irish worked like\r\ngalley slaves. From dawn to dark, in burning and daily increasing\r\nheat, they rowed, and poled, and hauled the boats by ropes through\r\nthe easier portions of the rapids. In the more difficult places it\r\nbecame necessary to lighten the whalers, and the crews had to unload\r\nthem partially or entirely and to transport the cargo across the\r\nrocks, work the boats through the broken water, and then carefully\r\nrepack them, with the knowledge, acquired by bitter experience, that\r\nan hour or two later the performance would have to be repeated.\r\nOccasionally, to avoid some especially bad piece of river, the boats\r\nhad to be emptied, lifted out of the water, and hauled across country\r\non the rollers provided for the purpose. Sometimes a boat missed the\r\nnarrow passage among the rocks which barred her way, and was whirled\r\nbackwards down the current until the men on the banks, hanging on\r\nto the drag ropes with their arms almost wrenched from the sockets,\r\nsucceeded in hauling her into slack water. Occasionally a whaler was\r\nwrecked; nearly every day and sometimes several times in the day\r\none or more were injured by striking against submerged rocks, and\r\nin default of professional boat-builders the officers had to repair\r\nthe damage themselves. Major-General (then Captain) Burton Forster’s\r\ndiary contains many references to his labours as a shipwright, and\r\na few are quoted almost at random, to show what “handy men” the\r\nofficers of the XVIIIth became in the expedition of 1884-85. “Found\r\nSergeant Evans’s boat again broken at a small rapid. Stopped, and put\r\nin a plank about nine feet long, as the original one was cracked all\r\nthat distance.” ... “Got all the ten boats of my Company up rapids\r\nby dark and beached them for repairs.” ... “Four-fifths of the keel\r\ntorn off Corporal ----’s boat, mended her.” The work went on for\r\nseven days a-week; there was no rest on Sundays, or even on Christmas\r\nday, the entry for which runs--“Divine service for Roman Catholics,\r\nthen drew boats up main rapids, kept moving, and unloaded in the\r\nevening.” In less arduous circumstances the voyage up the Nile would\r\nhave proved a pleasant experience, for the scenery possesses a weird\r\nbeauty of its own, wholly unlike that of any other part of the world;\r\nthe climate is glorious, and the endless series of ruins which line\r\nthe banks interesting in the extreme. But the officers of the Royal\r\nIrish had no time to admire scenery, or to study the archæology of\r\nthe ancient Egyptians. They had suddenly been turned into fresh-water\r\nsailors; they had become jacks-of-all-trades--shipwrights, doctors,\r\ndock labourers; they had to maintain discipline, to keep up _morale_,\r\nand to cheer the men when under the strain of unceasing toil even\r\ntheir buoyant spirits for a moment flagged.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the regiment thus records his reminiscences of the boat\r\nwork on the Nile--\r\n\r\n  “Greatcoats and nothing else was the favourite kit with the men\r\n  of my boat, who prided themselves on their dress and were anxious\r\n  to save one good suit of khaki in which, they said, they would\r\n  march into Khartoum. It was a handy costume when you stuck on a\r\n  sandbank or struck upon a rock, as you could be overboard in a\r\n  second to shove the boat off. Very often my men used to row in\r\n  their ‘birth-day suits’! Just before we started up the Nile I\r\n  had been transferred to a new company, and my skipper[259] left\r\n  the detailing of the crews of the boats to the Colour-Sergeant,\r\n  who took advantage of my youth and innocence (?) to put into my\r\n  boat ten of the biggest blackguards in the company, and a really\r\n  good corporal of the old stamp (Corporal George M‘Kee). Though I\r\n  was new to the company, my future boat’s crew were well known to\r\n  me by name and sight as being constant attenders at the Orderly\r\n  Room, so I thought a ‘few kind words’ would do them no harm, and\r\n  consequently informed them that I knew them well, but that we\r\n  were going to have no d----d nonsense in my boat, or out of it\r\n  they would go to sink or swim! A grin of amusement was all the\r\n  answer I got to my short speech.\r\n\r\n  “When we started off the Corporal and I were the only two men who\r\n  had ever handled an oar in their lives. Luckily the Corporal was\r\n  a good tough nut, and had been stroke in the regimental boat some\r\n  years previously when we were in Malta. That first day’s row is\r\n  still a nightmare to me. We left Sarras at 12 noon, the Corporal\r\n  and I doing the rowing, while the remainder did their best to\r\n  imitate us, but only succeeded for the most part in ‘catching\r\n  crabs.’ The current for the Nile was slight--but except quite\r\n  close in-shore it ran at about 3 miles an hour. Unfortunately\r\n  our Cox, never having handled a tiller before, kept alternately\r\n  running us out into the stream or into the banks. The distance\r\n  from Sarras to Gemai was only 12 or 14 miles, but we did not get\r\n  there till 8 P.M., and I thought we should never get there. I was\r\n  more dead-beat than I have ever been before or since, and once\r\n  I had thrown myself on to the sand when we eventually reached\r\n  Gemai, I could not have gone another yard. However, youth and a\r\n  sound sleep worked wonders, and next morning I was as fit as a\r\n  fiddle, and started loading up the food stuff--a job requiring a\r\n  lot of time and care, as each box had to be fitted into its place\r\n  like blocks in a Chinese puzzle. With the stores, we also took in\r\n  one or two Canadian _voyageurs_ per company. My company had two.\r\n  Regiments who had preceded us had had a _voyageur_ for each boat,\r\n  but a good many of them had become ‘fed up’ and had gone home or\r\n  to Hospital, and by the time the Royal Irish went up the river,\r\n  the supply only ran to about one or two for every 10 or 12 boats.\r\n\r\n  “I was given a French Canadian, and the company tool chest, and\r\n  told to bring up the rear--a pleasant task which meant I had to\r\n  go to the assistance of any boat in difficulties on a rock or\r\n  sandbank, come last into the night’s halting-place, and when\r\n  there sit up most of the night mending the ‘lame ducks’ of the\r\n  fleet. The actual mending did not take so long, as we soon learnt\r\n  to patch up holes and tears, but the repairs usually involved the\r\n  unloading of the boat, and fitting together the ‘Chinese puzzle’\r\n  of boxes in the dark was an operation that took two or three\r\n  hours.\r\n\r\n  “My Canadian was a very fine specimen of his class, and had\r\n  a flow of bad language--both French and English--that I have\r\n  seldom heard surpassed or even equalled. Owing to my being able\r\n  to talk a certain amount of French, we became very good friends,\r\n  and under his instruction I became an expert _voyageur_ both at\r\n  the helm and with the pole in the bows, and could have taken a\r\n  boat up any of the rapids. Though we were such good friends,\r\n  it did not prevent him ‘doing me in the eye.’ Each boat had a\r\n  box labelled ‘Medical comforts,’ which was on no account to be\r\n  opened. Very foolishly the authorities had a printed label on\r\n  the box showing its contents, which in addition to beef-tea,\r\n  arrowroot, &c., also consisted of 2 bottles of brandy and two of\r\n  port wine. It had been reported that no box of medical comforts\r\n  had reached its destination intact. I determined that my boat\r\n  should be the exception, so the box was put in the stern of the\r\n  boat, so that I could keep my eye on it during the day while I\r\n  pulled stroke, and at night I slept on it in the boat. Never did\r\n  it go out of my sight except at the portages, when my friend\r\n  George, the Canadian, volunteered to carry it for safety’s (?)\r\n  sake. I drew the line at carrying boxes at portages, and trusted\r\n  George. When, however, my box was examined on arrival at Korti,\r\n  though it appeared quite untouched, the liquor was all gone, the\r\n  arrowroot, &c., were, however, quite complete; George had no use\r\n  for _them_!\r\n\r\n  “It was marvellous how quickly the men took to rowing. In a few\r\n  days they were pulling powerful if not stylish oars, and they\r\n  certainly put their hearts and their backs into it. My crew of\r\n  blackguards were simply splendid, and we never had any difference\r\n  of opinion. On one occasion we came to a very stiff bit of\r\n  water, and I turned round and said, ‘Now, boys, we’ll have to\r\n  pull here,’ and the man behind--one of the biggest and sturdiest\r\n  scamps in the battalion, said, ‘Begorra, sir, we’ll pull to hell\r\n  wid you,’ and a voice from the bows added, ‘and out the other\r\n  side, sir.’\r\n\r\n  “The Nile sores were the things that troubled us most; any\r\n  scratches or in many cases ordinary rowing blisters, turned into\r\n  festering sores which nothing could cure so long as we remained\r\n  on the river. I took the skin off my ankle shoving the boat off a\r\n  rock, and tho’ I kept it perfectly clean, and put vaseline on it,\r\n  it would not heal. The strange thing was that once we got into\r\n  the desert, tho’ we could not wash, these sores all began to heal\r\n  at once.\r\n\r\n  “Other regiments suffered terribly from lice, but so far as I\r\n  know we had none in the Royal Irish. I certainly had none in my\r\n  company. I attribute this to the fact that our men were always\r\n  in the water to shove the boat off if she stuck on a sandbank or\r\n  rock, while I noticed other regiments seemed to dislike getting\r\n  into the water, and used to try to shove off a boat that stuck\r\n  with poles and oars, and much bad language. The day’s work did\r\n  not vary much: we awoke at the first streak of dawn--had some tea\r\n  or coffee and biscuit--bully beef if you cared for it, and then\r\n  used to sail if the wind was really strong--which to us seemed\r\n  very seldom,--to sail and row, if the wind was only moderate. If\r\n  there was no wind, or an adverse one, it was a case of rowing,\r\n  or towing if the bank was favourable, the latter being a quicker\r\n  mode of progression than rowing against the strong current. If\r\n  we had a really good sailing breeze, we didn’t like to waste\r\n  it, and had cold bully beef and biscuit at about midday as we\r\n  sailed along, but if we had had a tough morning’s row or two,\r\n  we used to halt for about an hour to have a hot meal. At about\r\n  sunset the leading boat of the company would halt for the night\r\n  at some suitable spot, and the others if possible closed up.\r\n  This often was not possible, owing to the numerous mishaps that\r\n  were always taking place from bumps on rocks and sandbanks. The\r\n  boats, when the Royal Irish took them over, had done several\r\n  trips already, and were for the most part in a pretty rotten\r\n  condition, and the materials for repairing them had run out, so\r\n  that we had to use any expedients such as biscuit tins, &c.,\r\n  to patch them up. I thought myself lucky if on arrival at the\r\n  night halting-place there was no damaged boat to mend, and that\r\n  in consequence I could get a full night’s sleep--such a splendid\r\n  sleep it was, too, under the clear sky of the Soudan winter!\r\n  The ordinary monotony of the journey was broken at places like\r\n  Dal, where one had to pull for four solid hours up a gigantic\r\n  mill-stream, sometimes only gaining a few feet after half an\r\n  hour’s pull, when one’s muscles felt as if they would crack. At\r\n  Dal we took out the rifles and ammunition and a few of the boxes\r\n  out of each boat, took a picked crew of eight men, and had two\r\n  half-breed Indians in the boat, one at the helm, the other in\r\n  the bows with a pole. It was most exciting work, and at first\r\n  the task looked an impossible one, but the skill with which the\r\n  _voyageurs_ took advantage of every back water, and shot past\r\n  the most dangerous-looking places was perfectly marvellous. Most\r\n  of us officers learnt the trick before we reached Korti, and\r\n  could have qualified as _voyageurs_. Amongst the _voyageurs_ I\r\n  should tell you, there were some who had not much claim to the\r\n  title, and hardly knew the stern of a boat from the bow. They\r\n  had come out for a picnic, but when they saw the Cataracts they\r\n  ‘went sick’! One of the so-called _voyageurs_ was a man who had\r\n  been in the Royal Irish a short time before we went to Egypt.\r\n  He was a smart, plucky fellow, who soon learnt the tricks of\r\n  the trade, and by the time the regiment came up he was quite an\r\n  expert, and went by the name of ‘Dare-Devil Dick.’ Some of the\r\n  _voyageurs_ were an insubordinate lot, and gave a good deal of\r\n  trouble--especially in wanting to halt, and as they were not\r\n  subject to military law it was difficult to know what to do with\r\n  them on these occasions. One gentleman, however, met his match,\r\n  after he had been particularly abusive to an officer who was\r\n  well known in the service for his handiness with his fists. The\r\n  _voyageur_, amongst other things, said that he was not going\r\n  to obey any one’s orders, and that he was as good a man as any\r\n  officer, so the officer told his men to row ashore, which they\r\n  did; he then took off his coat and said, ‘You said you were as\r\n  good a man as I am, take off your coat and I’ll show you whether\r\n  you are or not.’ The Canadian looked at him for a moment, and\r\n  then said, quite quietly, ‘No, boss, I guess not.’ ‘All right,’\r\n  said the officer, ‘you will obey my orders in future, or out of\r\n  the boat you go, neck and crop.’ After that there was no further\r\n  trouble.\r\n\r\n  “Pipes, or rather a lack of pipes, were soon a matter of great\r\n  difficulty. The old soldier had not acquired the modern habit\r\n  of cigarette smoking, and clay pipes were practically the only\r\n  kind the men ever smoked. In the rough work of the Nile boat\r\n  the supply of these soon gave out, and in my boat after about\r\n  a week there was only one stump of a ‘dhudheen’ left amongst\r\n  the twelve of us. This was passed round, each man getting ‘two\r\n  or three draws and a spit’ out of it. I had started with three\r\n  or four briar pipes, but they all disappeared--appropriated,\r\n  I regret to say, by officers. As I did not care to share the\r\n  dirty little stump that did duty for a pipe in my boat, I had\r\n  to devise something as a substitute for my beloved briars. A\r\n  broken oar-handle for the bowl, a boat’s auger, and a hollow reed\r\n  for the stem soon provided me with the means of making quite a\r\n  serviceable article. As the ash of the oar got very charred, the\r\n  bowl had to be lined with a bit of biscuit tin. My patent was\r\n  soon copied, and in a few days, as far as my crew was concerned,\r\n  it was a case of ‘one man one pipe.’ My pipe did me yeoman’s\r\n  service till after the return of the battalion from Metemmeh,\r\n  when, amongst other luxuries in the shape of jam and sardines, an\r\n  enterprising Greek brought up a store of wooden pipes which he\r\n  sold at fabulous prices.”\r\n\r\nThe only amusement on the voyage was to watch the wild geese and\r\npelicans which abounded in some parts of the river, to look for\r\ntraces of the hippopotami, much disturbed by the long procession\r\nof whale-boats through the upper part of the river, and to take\r\n“pot-shots” at the crocodiles. The old ones were wary, and offered\r\nbut indifferent targets for the officers’ revolvers; the young ones,\r\nless used to the ways of mankind, were slower in taking to the water.\r\nOne, indeed, remained so long on an overhanging bank that when a\r\nparty of the Royal Irish approached him his only means of escape was\r\nby taking a header into the water, right over a man who was standing\r\non the edge of the river.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of January the leading boats reached Korti, where by the\r\n27th the whole regiment was assembled, but not in the same strength\r\nas it left Cairo. The hardships and fatigues of the unaccustomed life\r\nhad taken toll, and many men had been dropped at various hospitals\r\non the line of communication.[260] One soldier had been drowned in\r\nthe Nile, a fate which Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Shaw, V.C., nearly\r\nshared. His boat was working close in-shore when a sudden fall of\r\nearth and stones from the bank struck her gunwale, and threw him into\r\nthe swiftly running river. As soon as the dust had cleared away he\r\nwas seen struggling in the stream; instantly Orderly-Room Sergeant\r\nHanrahan and Colour-Sergeant Moylan plunged into the water, swam to\r\nhim, and held him up until all three were rescued. For this gallant\r\naction the bronze medals of the Royal Humane Society were awarded to\r\nthese non-commissioned officers. The Royal Irish won great praise not\r\nonly for the short time in which they made the passage from Sarras,\r\nbut also for the excellent care they had taken of the stores with\r\nwhich their boats were freighted, and Lord Wolseley’s thanks were\r\nofficially conveyed to them in a special general order dated the 4th\r\nof February, 1885.\r\n\r\n  “The following battalions in the order given have completed the\r\n  journey from Sarras to Debbeh in the quickest time:--\r\n\r\n  1. The 1st Battalion Royal Irish.\r\n  2. The 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders.\r\n  3. The 1st Battalion Royal West Kent.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd Division Naval Brigade, the Royal Irish, and the Royal\r\n  West Kent have distinguished themselves by the care they have\r\n  taken of their boats. The division of the Naval Brigade and\r\n  Captain Forster’s Company of the Royal Irish handed in their\r\n  supplies at Korti complete, no case or package being either\r\n  damaged or missing. General Lord Wolseley congratulates the\r\n  men of the Royal Irish most heartily upon having won the small\r\n  prize which he offered to mark his personal appreciation of\r\n  the battalion which should accomplish the difficult journey of\r\n  about 370 miles in the shortest time. As they have been first on\r\n  the river, so he hopes they may be amongst the first to enter\r\n  Khartoum, and he feels assured that he can wish this old and\r\n  distinguished regiment nothing more thoroughly in accordance with\r\n  its own desires.\r\n\r\n  “It has been most gratifying to watch the manner in which all\r\n  the battalions have striven to reach at the earliest date this\r\n  point where the army was to concentrate, and Lord Wolseley\r\n  warmly thanks both officers and soldiers for the untiring spirit\r\n  shown by them in overcoming the many and serious obstacles to\r\n  navigation presented by the cataracts and rapids of the great\r\n  river. All alike have worked well and cheerfully under conditions\r\n  entailing considerable privation and continuous labour.\r\n\r\n  “The conduct of all ranks has been most creditable to the\r\n  army, and Lord Wolseley will not fail to bring the energy and\r\n  discipline that have been shown to the notice of Her Majesty the\r\n  Queen.\r\n\r\n  “EVELYN WOOD,\r\n  “_Chief of Staff_.”\r\n\r\nIn forwarding his cheque for £100 Lord Wolseley wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “CAMP KORTI, THE SOUDAN,\r\n  “_11th March 1885_.\r\n\r\n  “DEAR COLONEL SHAW,--It is with the greatest pleasure that I send\r\n  you the enclosed cheque for £100, the prize won by your splendid\r\n  Battalion by having come up the Nile to Debbeh in boats in less\r\n  time than any other Regiment. Being an Irishman myself it is very\r\n  gratifying to feel that my small prize has been carried off by\r\n  my own countrymen.--Believe me to be, dear Col. Shaw, very truly\r\n  yours, WOLSELEY.”\r\n\r\nThe general situation, as far as it was known when the XVIIIth\r\nreached Korti, was very gloomy. Khartoum was besieged on three\r\nsides, and on Gordon now rested the entire burden of its defence. In\r\nAugust he had sent his only fellow-countrymen, Lieutenant-Colonel D.\r\nStewart and Mr Power, the correspondent of ‘The Times,’ on a mission\r\ndown the river; their steamer had been wrecked, and they had been\r\ntreacherously murdered by Arabs who had offered them hospitality.\r\nThus with no officer whom he could trust, no friend in whom he could\r\nconfide, he was left alone to face the hordes of fanatics by whom\r\nhe was surrounded, while his men were suffering much from physical\r\nprivations, and from the mental depression produced by waiting in\r\nvain for the British troops who, as their General had repeatedly\r\nassured them, were coming to their help. The tone of Gordon’s latest\r\nmessages, brought by native runners to Lord Wolseley, showed that his\r\nposition was growing so desperate that the time for which Khartoum\r\ncould hold out must no longer be reckoned in months and weeks,\r\nbut in days and hours. A modification of the plan of campaign had\r\ntherefore become necessary. In the original scheme the point for the\r\nsecond concentration of the relieving force was fixed at Shendi, a\r\ntown on the right bank of the Nile, faced on the opposite shore by\r\nthe villages of Metemmeh and Gubat. But the passage of a column of\r\nboats over the four hundred miles of river between Korti and Shendi\r\nwould inevitably take several weeks. Hitherto the troops had only\r\nbeen called upon to overcome natural difficulties: now they would\r\nbe in the enemy’s country, and while working up rapids at least\r\nas troublesome as those already ascended, they would be exposed\r\nat any moment to attack and consequent delay. Even if unmolested\r\non the lower reaches, they were committed to one serious military\r\noperation, the capture of Berber, a town on the Nile a hundred miles\r\nbelow Shendi; it commanded the river, and therefore must be seized\r\nand occupied before the expedition could pass it on the voyage up\r\nstream. From these various causes the column must necessarily move so\r\nslowly that long before the first whaler could be expected to appear\r\noff Shendi, Gordon might be overwhelmed, yet the Nile was the only\r\nroute by which a large body of troops with adequate supplies could be\r\nplaced within striking distance of Khartoum. For smaller detachments,\r\nhowever, the river was not the only possible line of advance. A\r\nglance at the map will show that the Nile in its windings between\r\nShendi and Korti forms two sides of a huge triangle, the third side\r\nof which is marked by the camel track, 173 miles in length, linking\r\nKorti with Metemmeh. This road crosses the Bayuda desert, a barren\r\nwaste of sand, dotted at rare intervals with wells for the most part\r\ninadequate for the needs of any considerable number of animals and\r\nmen--yet in a dash across this desert lay the only hope of saving\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley determined to divide the force which remained available\r\nfor active operations after the safety of his line of communication\r\nhad been secured. To Major-General Earle he entrusted the “river\r\ncolumn,” a strong brigade of all arms, which, after capturing\r\nBerber, was to establish an advanced base near Shendi. The camel\r\ncorps and various other troops were placed under the orders of\r\nBrigadier-General Sir Herbert Stewart, who was to lead the “desert\r\ncolumn” across country to Metemmeh, and there establish an advanced\r\nbase. If the information he received there convinced him that\r\nKhartoum was at the last gasp, he was to push forward at once with\r\nthe “camelry” to Gordon’s rescue, but if the danger did not seem\r\nimmediate he was to stand fast, and co-operate with Earle when\r\nthe river column had won its way to Shendi. If Stewart halted at\r\nMetemmeh, his Intelligence officer, Colonel Sir Charles Wilson, was\r\nto embark with a few picked men on the Egyptian steamers which were\r\nknown to be waiting on that part of the Nile to establish touch with\r\nthe British, push on towards Khartoum, and, if possible, communicate\r\nwith Gordon.\r\n\r\nThough Lord Wolseley was intensely anxious to place Stewart’s column\r\nwithin reach of Gordon, it was not until the end of December that the\r\npreparations for the movement were completed. Among the innumerable\r\ndifficulties which confronted the commander of the expedition\r\ntwo stood out pre-eminently. One was the probability, almost the\r\ncertainty, that at Metemmeh the desert column would find neither food\r\nfor themselves nor forage for their camels, and that a large amount\r\nof bulky supplies must therefore accompany the troops. The other was\r\nthe fact that, although camels were the only means by which stores\r\ncould be carried across the desert, the number of these animals at\r\nhis disposal was inadequate, and could not be supplemented from local\r\nsources, as the Mudir of Dongola had failed in his promise to obtain\r\na large quantity of them from his tribesmen. As enough camels could\r\nnot be collected to carry to Metemmeh in one trip the _personnel_\r\nand supplies of the column, Wolseley decided to cross the Bayuda\r\ndesert by stages. To carry out this plan it was necessary, as a first\r\nmeasure, to form a depôt between Korti and Metemmeh; and Gakdul,[261]\r\n98 miles from Korti, was selected, as it was known that its two or\r\nthree natural reservoirs yielded a good supply of drinking water.\r\nIn addition to the stores which were to be left at Gakdul, and the\r\nsupplies for the march there and back, the camels had to carry not\r\nonly their own food, for the desert yielded but scanty grazing, but\r\nalso water for the whole column, as it was known that the wells\r\nbetween Korti and Gakdul could not be depended upon. As the XVIIIth\r\na month later followed the track of this convoy, the details of\r\nthe march of Stewart’s “camelry” will show how remarkable were the\r\nperformances of the first battalion, when it crossed the desert on\r\nfoot. At 3 P.M. on December 30, 1884, the first convoy of 2206 camels\r\nstarted, with an escort of about 1100 troops, the mounted infantry on\r\ncamels, the XIXth Hussars on their horses. With an interval of two\r\nhours the column marched till 7.30 A.M. on the 31st, rested for eight\r\nhours, then pushed on again, stopping at 8 P.M. for a short time\r\nat the wells of Hambok, where a small quantity of very indifferent\r\nwater was obtained, and halted at 1.15 A.M. on January 1, 1885, at\r\nthe well of El Howeiya, which yielded no better water than that of\r\nHambok. At 8.30 A.M. the convoy was again in motion, and plodded on\r\ntill 1 P.M., rested for two hours and a half, and then pushed on\r\nthroughout the night and early morning until at 6.45 A.M. on the 2nd\r\nit reached Gakdul, where there proved to be abundance of good water.\r\nThe ninety-eight miles from Korti had been covered in 63¾ hours, 32¾\r\nhours of which had been spent in actual marching; but weary as the\r\ntroops were, no rest could be allowed them. The stores with which the\r\ncamels were loaded had to be unpacked and arranged in proper order;\r\nthe camels to be watered--a process which occupied the whole day,\r\nand the post to be prepared for defence, for though from the absence\r\nof formed bodies of the enemy it was clear that the march across the\r\ndesert had taken the Mahdists by surprise, their scouts had been seen\r\nhovering in the distance.\r\n\r\nBefore the next stage in the advance to Metemmeh could be undertaken\r\nthe intermediate base had to be completely filled up with supplies,\r\nand to bring these, Stewart started on the return journey to Korti\r\nless than fourteen hours after he had reached Gakdul. He left behind\r\nhim a garrison of 422 officers and men to guard the wells, and\r\nimprove the arrangements for watering the troops and the camels; and\r\nhe dropped small parties at the minor water-holes to clean them to\r\nthe best of their ability. By noon on the 5th Stewart was back at\r\nKorti; but though his men had not suffered from their exertions, his\r\ncamels had felt the strain. Tired by their long march up the Nile,\r\nthe animals were in poor condition when they left Korti; they had\r\nbeen on short rations of food and water on the journey to and from\r\nGakdul, and though every effort had been made to bring more camels\r\nfrom lower Egypt, the supply of fresh animals was quite inadequate,\r\nand the rest of the work in the desert had to be done by beasts whose\r\nstrength and endurance was rapidly diminishing. On the 7th a second\r\nconvoy of 1000 camels left Korti: 100 were laden with small-arm\r\nammunition, 80 with medical stores, 30 with artillery stores, the\r\nremainder with food supplies. This column reached Gakdul in safety,\r\nand on its return passed Stewart, who on the 8th marched from Korti\r\nwith 1600 troops, about 300 natives (chiefly camel-drivers from\r\nAden), 2228 camels, and 155 horses.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of the desert march began on January 14, when\r\nStewart pushed southwards from Gakdul with 1802 officers and men,\r\nthree light pieces of artillery and a “Gardner” gun, 155 horses\r\nbelonging to the XIXth Hussars, 1700 riding and 1188 transport\r\ncamels. Two days later the XIXth Hussars came into contact with the\r\nenemy near the wells of Abu Klea, where on the 17th the Mahdists,\r\nafter a very desperate fight, were defeated with a loss of about a\r\nthousand killed. Our casualties were 9 officers and 65 other ranks\r\nkilled, 9 officers and 85 other ranks wounded. Struggling onwards\r\ntowards Metemmeh, the desert column again met the enemy on the 19th,\r\nthis time at Abu Kru, close to the river. The Arabs fought with as\r\nmuch gallantry as at Abu Klea, but were again heavily defeated, and\r\nfled leaving the ground covered with their dead. To us the cost of\r\nthis engagement was 1 officer and 22 other ranks killed, 8 officers\r\nand 90 other ranks wounded; among the latter was Sir Herbert Stewart,\r\nwho eventually succumbed to his injuries. When he fell, Colonel Sir\r\nCharles Wilson succeeded to the command of the troops, though Captain\r\nLord Charles Beresford, R.N., in charge of the small Naval contingent\r\nwhich accompanied the column, was actually the senior officer present.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, Wilson occupied the village of Gubat, which is within\r\nhalf a mile of the river; next day he threatened Metemmeh, two\r\nmiles farther inland, but before his attack had developed several\r\nEgyptian steamers came in sight, and some hundreds of Gordon’s\r\nSoudanese soldiers landed, bringing the news that a considerable body\r\nof Mahdists were advancing. Wilson recalled his troops; fortified\r\nhimself at Gubat; reconnoitred in various directions, and after many\r\ndelays owing to the worn-out machinery of the river-boats, embarked\r\non the 24th with a handful of the Royal Sussex and a considerable\r\nnumber of the Soudanese on his mission to Khartoum. It was not until\r\nthis date that he was able to send off a despatch to Lord Wolseley\r\ndescribing the battle of the 19th and the movements which followed\r\nit. This report reached Korti in the early morning of January 28, and\r\nWolseley at once decided to send Sir Redvers Buller to take command\r\nof the desert column, and to reinforce it with infantry, who were not\r\nto be carried on camels but to march on foot. Mindful of his promise\r\nthat the battalion which won his prize on the river should have\r\nevery opportunity of distinguishing itself on land, Lord Wolseley\r\nselected the Royal Irish to accompany Sir Redvers, and ordered them\r\nto move in detachments, the headquarters with A, B, and C companies\r\nstarting that evening, the remainder following as soon as possible.\r\nIn the afternoon of January 28, 1885, the battalion paraded for\r\nLord Wolseley’s inspection, dressed in the fighting kit devised for\r\nthem by a former commanding officer, Colonel M. J. R. MacGregor. It\r\nconsisted of a khaki-coloured frock and trousers of cotton drill,\r\na helmet covered with the same material, grey woollen putties,\r\na woollen shirt, socks, and ammunition boots; spine protectors,\r\ncholera belts, and drawers had been issued, but were not in general\r\nuse among the rank and file; all hands carried haversacks, wooden\r\nwater-bottles, and rolled greatcoats. The officers wore “Sam Browne”\r\nbelts, which supported their swords and field-glasses, revolvers\r\nand cartridge-pouches; the non-commissioned officers and men were\r\nequipped with braces and waistbelts, pouches containing seventy\r\nrounds of ammunition, three-edged bayonets (longer than those in\r\nuse at the present day), and Martini-Henry rifles. As in previous\r\ncampaigns it had been discovered that when these rifles were fired\r\nfast, the barrels became so hot that it was almost impossible to\r\ngrasp them, they were fitted with leather hand-guards, tightly laced\r\nround the stock and barrel behind the back-sight, to enable the men\r\nto get a firm grip of their weapons. The remainder of the campaigning\r\nkit was carried on transport camels; to every ten men was allotted\r\none animal, which was loaded with their camp kettles, a blanket and a\r\nwaterproof sheet apiece, and one or two sea-kit bags, each of which\r\ncontained sets of the following articles, viz.: one flannel shirt,\r\ntwo pairs of socks, a tin of grease, a canteen, a towel, soap, and a\r\nhold-all, complete. The troops were allowed no tents.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Wolseley rode on to the parade ground he was saluted by as\r\nfine a body of soldiers as he had ever seen. By a process of natural\r\nselection the weakly men had been weeded out in the voyage up the\r\nriver, and only those of perfect constitution had reached Korti.\r\nThanks to the varied forms of exercise they had taken since they left\r\nCairo, the soldiers drawn up before him were in rude health and fit\r\nto go anywhere and do anything. After he had warmly praised their\r\nappearance, which he described as “hard, lean, and long-legged,” and\r\ninformed them that to the regiment would probably be awarded the\r\nprize for the race from Sarras to Debbeh, he warned the Royal Irish\r\nthat very hard work awaited them in the Bayuda desert. Before they\r\ncould reach Gakdul they would have to make six marches, each sixteen\r\nmiles long, in a country so dry that they must not count on receiving\r\nmore than half a gallon of water a-day, a ration which they must make\r\ndo for drinking, cooking, and washing! He wound up his speech by\r\ntelling the XVIIIth that he trusted soon to join it on the other side\r\nof the desert, a hope, however, doomed to be frustrated by specific\r\norders from home desiring him to remain at Korti, the better to\r\ndirect the movements both of the desert and the river columns, the\r\nlatter of which had been set in motion on the 24th of January.\r\n\r\nWhen the inspection was over the headquarter companies returned to\r\ntheir preparations for the march. The skins containing water for\r\nthe journey were filled, rations drawn, camels taken down to the\r\nriver to drink and then loaded, and just after nightfall on January\r\n28, 1885, the column started--as all ranks hoped and believed for\r\nKhartoum. The first two or three stages of the journey across the\r\ndesert were by no means agreeable. The men of the XVIIIth had not\r\nonly to look after their own regimental camels and those of the large\r\nconvoy they were escorting to Gakdul, but to watch over the safety\r\nof a number of slaughter cattle and to prevent the camel-drivers\r\nfrom tapping the water-skins, which were not to be opened unless by\r\norder of high authority. Though the Royal Irish had mastered the\r\nways of a whale-boat in the rapids, they were new to the tricks of\r\nthe camel-drivers, who, from idleness or dishonesty, often fastened\r\nthe loads so insecurely that in the night everything slipped off\r\nthe saddles and fell in a cascade upon the sand. The soldiers\r\nhad to pick up the boxes of stores and baggage which littered the\r\ndesert and re-pack them firmly; they had also to halt frequently to\r\nenable weakly or lazy animals to keep up in their proper places;\r\nbut when, after two or three rude experiences, they had learned\r\nhow to cope with the camels and the natives who drove them, these\r\ninitial difficulties were overcome and the troops pushed sturdily\r\non towards Gakdul. For the greater part of the way the track ran\r\nover great plains of yellow sand, which played havoc with the men’s\r\nboots, already partly worn out by the _portages_ on the Nile; but\r\noccasionally it crossed low round-topped ridges of black rock,\r\nbelts of coarse dark-green grass, and thick growths of low acacia\r\nand mimosa trees. As the column marched at night and rested by day,\r\nthe officers were able to get some sport; a gazelle was bagged and\r\nmany sand-grouse were seen, though not hit, for the Martini-Henry\r\nrifle hardly lends itself to shooting birds on the wing! The rations\r\nconsisted of a pound of ship’s biscuit and the same amount of\r\npreserved salt beef, an ounce of tea and three of sugar, an ounce of\r\npreserved vegetables, a quarter of an ounce of salt, and 1/320 of\r\na gallon of lime juice. The thirst produced by the combined effect\r\nof the salt beef and the dry heat of the desert was great, and the\r\nregular allowance of half a gallon of water was hardly sufficient\r\nto quench it. General Forster’s diary records the joy with which\r\nall hands greeted the occasional issue of a larger supply; an\r\nadditional quart rendered it possible to do a little cooking, while\r\nan extra half gallon brought some form of washing within the range of\r\npractical politics! On the half gallon issue the men could only spare\r\nenough water to make tea; as their salt beef had been well cooked\r\nbefore it was hermetically sealed in tin, they ate it cold; if water\r\nenough could be obtained, the preserved vegetables were soaked and\r\nboiled in the lid of a canteen.[262] To rest the camels, now breaking\r\ndown fast from the combined effects of too much work and too little\r\nfood and water, the convoy halted at the wells of El Howeyat for\r\ntwenty-four hours and then marched on to Gakdul. The headquarters of\r\nthe Royal Irish reached this post early on the 4th of February, and\r\nnext day were joined by four more companies (D, E, F, and G) of the\r\nbattalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Wray. Unencumbered by the charge\r\nof a large convoy, this detachment had covered the ninety-eight miles\r\nbetween Korti and Gakdul in a hundred and eight hours--a very fine\r\nperformance for men who, though in perfect all-round training, had\r\ndone no marching for many weeks.\r\n\r\nThe journey across the desert had so far been uneventful. The\r\nonly exciting incident was the escapade of a lance-corporal, who\r\ntemporarily losing his reason, wandered into the desert, and was\r\nnot rescued till he had strayed twelve miles from the bivouac. A\r\nfew tribesmen, captured by the irregulars who guarded the lines of\r\ncommunication, were the only enemies seen; they were wild-looking\r\nsavages, short but wiry, with fierce eyes gleaming under shocks of\r\nmatted hair, and armed with formidable spears more than five feet\r\nin length. They did not form part of the Mahdi’s regular army, but\r\nwere local freebooters, more disposed to plunder than to fight. When\r\nthe Royal Irish were a few miles north of Gakdul they met messengers\r\nhurrying to Korti with the news that Khartoum had fallen. On the 5th\r\nthey had comparative rest, but on the 6th they were kept hard at work\r\nfilling water-skins at the wells, ready for the next stage in their\r\nadvance--Gakdul to Abu Klea, a distance of fifty-two miles. While\r\nthus employed they were joined by H company, which had been detained\r\nat Korti when the second detachment moved forward. In their anxiety\r\nto lose no chance of distinguishing themselves the company had made\r\na great march, winding up by covering twenty-eight miles on the last\r\nday. Sir Redvers Buller, who had ridden part of the way from Korti\r\nwith the headquarter companies, did not allow H company to start with\r\nthe rest of the battalion when it marched on the 7th, but, mounting\r\nthem on camels, sent them on a day or two later. How the men liked\r\nthis new form of locomotion is not recorded, but it is probable that\r\nmany agreed with the sailor who, after his first ride, remarked, “My\r\ncamel is a queer beast. He’s been playing cup and ball with me all\r\nthe afternoon and only missed me twice!”\r\n\r\nHitherto only the precautions usual in ordinary warfare had been\r\ntaken on the march and in the bivouac, but now that the Royal Irish\r\nwere well in the enemy’s country and liable to attack at any moment,\r\nthe formation was adopted which recent experience had proved to be\r\nbest suited for fighting in the Soudan. Under the immediate escort\r\nof one company, successive lines of camels, about forty abreast,\r\nlumbered along in a loose column which, if necessary, could be closed\r\nup into a solid mass. At one of the front angles of the column of\r\ncamels were four companies; at the opposite rear angle was the\r\nremainder of the battalion, both marching in column or half-column\r\nof companies, ready to form square at a moment’s notice. The animals\r\nladen with the reserve of ammunition moved behind the leading\r\ncompanies into whose square they were to be received in case of\r\ndanger; those bearing the rations and the water-skins followed the\r\ncompanies in rear, who were charged with their defence. If the enemy\r\nattacked, each square could support the other with flanking fire,\r\nand both could rake the ground over which spearmen would have to\r\npass in order to close on the camels with the cold steel. At every\r\nhalt square was formed, and at night the bivouacs were surrounded\r\nwith _zaribas_--walls of stone, boxes of stores, saddles or mimosa\r\nbushes, anything, in short, which would serve to break a sudden rush\r\nof the Mahdi’s followers.\r\n\r\nThe column, however, was not attacked, and notwithstanding the\r\ncumbrous formation in which the Royal Irish moved they got over\r\nthe ground fast, and on one occasion marched twenty-four miles in\r\ntwenty-five hours and a quarter, coming in fairly fresh, alert, and\r\nfit for outpost duty. They reached Abu Klea on the morning of the\r\n12th, passing close to the battlefield of January 17, still covered\r\nwith dead bodies, for though the Mahdists had buried their chiefs,\r\nthe rank and file remained where they had fallen. Two companies,\r\nC and E, were dropped at the wells to strengthen the garrison of\r\nthe post; the remainder of the battalion, after a few hours’ rest,\r\nstarted for Gubat, where they arrived next day after a march of\r\ntwenty-one miles, “swinging into bivouac,” as Sir Redvers Buller\r\nreported, “as cheerily as if they had been going to a field-day at\r\nAldershot.” The troops of the desert column received the XVIIIth with\r\ngreat enthusiasm, turning out to a man to cheer it into camp. Among\r\nthem were the soldiers who had accompanied Wilson in his abortive\r\nattempt to rescue Gordon from Khartoum, and who had just struggled\r\nback to Gubat after a series of adventures, remarkable even in the\r\nannals of the British army. In two tiny steamers, manned by natives\r\nof very doubtful loyalty, they had laboriously passed through the\r\nlong and dangerous series of rapids known as the Sixth Cataract,\r\nand after running the gauntlet of the enemy’s guns and rifles, had\r\narrived off Khartoum--to find that barely thirty-six hours earlier\r\nthe town had been captured by the Mahdi, into whose hands Gordon,\r\nif he was still alive, had undoubtedly fallen. Wilson realised that\r\nhis mission had failed, and with a heavy heart ordered his steamers\r\nto retire down the river. The retreat was conducted in circumstances\r\nas unpropitious as can be imagined; the native crews, excited at the\r\ndefeat of the Christian General, were almost mutinous; the Soudanese,\r\nby far the majority of the fighting men on board, were stupefied\r\nby the knowledge that their wives and children were in the Mahdi’s\r\nclutches; every hour the dangers of navigation increased, for the\r\nNile was sinking fast, and in one night dropped no less than three\r\nfeet. But in spite of all difficulties Wilson made good progress\r\ndown stream until his steamers, one after the other, were wrecked by\r\nthe treachery of the Arab pilots. Landing his troops on an island he\r\nentrenched himself, and succeeded in informing the British at Gubat\r\nof his desperate plight. The sailors at once manned one of the river\r\nboats and fought their way up the Nile in time to save Wilson and his\r\ncomrades from the destruction which threatened to overwhelm them.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Gubat, Buller had received a despatch from Lord\r\nWolseley written after the news of the fall of Khartoum had reached\r\nheadquarters, but before the rescue of Wilson’s detachment had been\r\nreported at Korti. His orders were to ensure the safety of Wilson and\r\nhis men; to send all sick and wounded back to Korti; to make every\r\npreparation for the evacuation of Gubat, and if he considered it\r\nnecessary, to fall back to Abu Klea or even to Gakdul. When Buller\r\nreached Gubat the situation was full of difficulty. Wilson indeed\r\nwas safe, but within two miles of the bivouac was the strongly built\r\nvillage of Metemmeh, which we had threatened but not seriously\r\nattacked. It was held by two thousand of the enemy, almost delirious\r\nwith joy at their victory at Khartoum; the Intelligence officers had\r\nascertained that three or four thousand Mahdists, well provided with\r\nrifles, guns, and ammunition would shortly reinforce Metemmeh, and\r\nas there was nothing now to detain the Mahdi before Khartoum, his\r\nmain army might also have to be reckoned with. The supplies of the\r\ndesert column were running short: at Gubat there were only rations\r\nfor twelve days, and the depôt at Abu Klea contained but a similar\r\nquantity. Worse than all, the transport was breaking down rapidly;\r\n“the camels,” Buller reported, “are emaciated, and their carrying\r\npower small. Indeed I do not think we have camels enough to get this\r\nforce out at one go.” After a few hours’ deliberation he reluctantly\r\ndecided to retire, and began his preparations, fortunately unhindered\r\nby the enemy who circled round the bivouac without attempting to\r\nclose in upon it. Early on the morning of the 13th of February the\r\nsick and wounded were sent off, the convalescents on camels, the\r\nworst cases on stretchers carried by Gordon’s Soudanese. The convoy\r\nwas escorted by part of the camel corps and three companies of the\r\nRoyal Irish, and when all danger of an attack seemed over, the\r\ndetachment was ordered to rejoin the main body of the battalion. Just\r\nas the three companies reached the bivouac a Hussar orderly dashed\r\ninto the lines to report that eight or nine miles off the convoy was\r\nsurrounded by a large number of the enemy, and was in great peril.\r\nColonel Shaw and half a battalion of the XVIIIth hurried off to the\r\nrescue, but to their deep disgust did not come into action. The\r\nMahdists had surrounded the convoy on three sides and were pouring\r\nin a fairly well directed fire when a detachment of camelry, on the\r\nway from Abu Klea to Gubat, suddenly struck the enemy on the flank\r\njust as the Royal Irish began to come in sight. The Arabs did not\r\nawait Shaw’s attack and retired, leaving the convoy free to go on\r\nto Abu Klea, which it reached without further incident. Shaw’s half\r\nbattalion did not accompany the sick, but was ordered back to Gubat,\r\nwhere the troops spent the night in destroying stores which could not\r\nbe carried away and throwing into the Nile boxes of ammunition for\r\nwhich there was no transport. As day broke on the 14th, the column,\r\n1700 strong, was set in motion. With the exception of a few of the\r\nXIXth Hussars whose horses were still serviceable, all arms and\r\nall ranks trudged over the desert on foot. The post of honour, the\r\ncommand of the rear-guard, was entrusted to Colonel Shaw, who covered\r\nthe retreat with the Royal Irish, two guns, a detachment of the XIXth\r\nHussars, and three hundred of Gordon’s Soudanese. A few of the enemy\r\nfollowed, but when Buller halted and offered battle the Mahdists\r\ndrew off, and by midday on the 15th the column was in bivouac at\r\nAbu Klea. The men had not suffered much on the march, though the\r\nboots were beginning to fall off their feet, but so many animals had\r\ndropped from exhaustion that General Buller was forced to admit that\r\nany active operations were entirely out of the question, until the\r\nmounted corps were supplied with fresh camels, the transport camels\r\nreplaced, and the XIXth Hussars completely remounted. There was not\r\nforage enough for the surviving animals, and it was evident that the\r\nwells could not be relied upon to supply the whole of the troops now\r\nconcentrated around them. Buller accordingly decided to send back\r\nto Gakdul most of the camelry, all spare camels, and nearly all the\r\nXIXth Hussars, while with the remainder of his command he awaited\r\ninstructions at Abu Klea.\r\n\r\nThe two companies of the XVIIIth detached to garrison the post of\r\nAbu Klea now rejoined headquarters, bringing with them a record of\r\nexcellent service performed in clearing the bush which surrounded the\r\nwells, building _zaribas_, and similar useful though unshowy work.\r\nEarly on the 16th, the battalion was directed to entrench one of the\r\nlow hills which encircle the wells; just as the shelter trenches\r\nwere finished and occupied, and the men were eating a well-earned\r\nmeal, large numbers of the enemy appeared on ground commanding the\r\ndefences of the Royal Irish, and opened fire at about 1100 yards’\r\nrange. To meet this attack, which enfiladed some of the trenches,\r\nfresh works had to be thrown up under continuous and sometimes very\r\nheavy musketry. “The Gardner and the screw-guns gave the enemy a\r\nlittle physic,” wrote an officer in his diary, “but the rebels kept\r\nit up all night, and we expected an attack at any time. Next morning\r\nthey began in a desultory sort of way, but a few shells and a strong\r\ninfantry fire made them lie close. Finally a field-piece of theirs\r\ncame into action, but its shells fell short and dead. Two of our\r\n7-pounders went out and fired a round or two, and the Mahdists then\r\ndisappeared. We had an easy night on the 17th, and only regretted\r\ntwo things: one that we had not had a slap at them, the other that\r\nwe had not received the half pound of bread that was due to us as a\r\nration!” During this prolonged skirmish, in which there were many\r\n“close shaves” from the flat-trajectoried Remington rifles used\r\nby the enemy, Quartermaster and Honorary Lieutenant Jamieson and\r\nthirteen other ranks were wounded.[263] In the column the total\r\ncasualties were three men killed, four officers and twenty-three\r\nother ranks wounded. For the next few days the regiment was very busy\r\ncutting down scrub and building redoubts--work with which the enemy’s\r\nfire did not materially interfere, as it was delivered from a very\r\nrespectful distance.\r\n\r\nWhen the untoward news of the fall of Khartoum reached England, the\r\ncountry was profoundly moved. A great cry for vengeance arose, and\r\namidst a whirlwind of telegrams from the Cabinet, Lord Wolseley\r\nrecast his plans, and proposed that the towns of Abu Hamed and Berber\r\nshould be captured, and held during the summer as posts to cover\r\nan advance in strength up the river in the cool season. Government\r\naccepted the idea, and sent an expedition to Suakim to draw off to\r\nthe shores of the Red Sea part of the enemy who might otherwise\r\nattack the troops echeloned along the Nile. But by the middle of\r\nFebruary it become evident that Wolseley’s scheme was too ambitious.\r\nThe river column, though successful in an engagement at Kirbekan, was\r\nmaking slow progress up stream owing to the abnormally “low Nile.”\r\nTo enable this column to arrive at Berber with its cargo of stores\r\nintact, the original plan had provided that it should be fed by\r\nconvoys across the desert of Korosko, but recent events at Khartoum\r\nhad roused the fanaticism of the tribesmen to such an extent that\r\nit was very improbable this route would long remain open. A large\r\nquantity of Earle’s biscuit had proved uneatable; the remainder would\r\nonly carry the column to Berber and back to Korti, and therefore none\r\ncould be left to ration the garrison of Berber when that place had\r\nbeen taken. Wolseley thereupon proposed that the Royal Irish and part\r\nof the camel corps should strike across the Bayuda desert and fall\r\nupon Berber from the westward, but he was forced to abandon this idea\r\nwhen he realised that the transport, without which it was impossible\r\nto undertake the expedition to Berber, had completely given out, and\r\nthat the marching power of the troops was seriously crippled by the\r\ncondition of their boots.\r\n\r\n  “In view of all these conditions the Commander-in-Chief felt\r\n  that he was no longer justified in persevering with the combined\r\n  movement of the Desert and River columns on Berber, and he was\r\n  forced, reluctantly, to abandon all hope of taking that place\r\n  before the autumn. The intention to take Berber being given up,\r\n  the capture of Abu Hamed became unnecessary; it would only have\r\n  led to a useless waste of life, and have unnecessarily prolonged\r\n  the line of river to be defended during the summer months.\r\n  The retention of the Desert column in its exposed position in\r\n  the desert was equally without object. A concentration on the\r\n  Nile became the only course open to Lord Wolseley. Orders were\r\n  accordingly sent on the 20th February, directing the river\r\n  column to return ... and at the same time Sir Redvers Buller was\r\n  directed to return to Korti.”[264]\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this order the one thousand seven hundred and forty\r\neffectives,[265] left to General Buller, made ready to march on the\r\nevening of the 23rd of February after an exciting day. About 11\r\nA.M. Captain Morgan, Royal Irish Regiment, from his outpost to the\r\nsouth-east of the bivouac had signalled that masses of the enemy were\r\nadvancing towards Abu Klea. Later it was reported that the Mahdists,\r\nbetween five and eight thousand strong, had halted two or three\r\nmiles from the wells. The situation was a serious one, but neither\r\nthe General nor his men were disturbed at the news: the packing was\r\ncarefully finished, the convoy of wounded sent off under a strong\r\nescort, the wells filled up with thorny scrub and the many saddles\r\nfor which there were no camels left, and soon after sunset the\r\ntroops filed away in good order, leaving the Royal Irish to bring\r\nup the rear. The camp fires were made up, the usual bugle calls\r\nwere sounded, and then in groups of twos and threes the men of the\r\nXVIIIth silently collected at the appointed place and were formed\r\ninto a rear-guard. Whether the evacuation of the wells was unnoticed\r\nby the enemy, or whether the Mahdists thought it wiser not to attack\r\nthe retiring column, is not known, but the fact remains that Buller\r\nwas not seriously molested in his retreat, of which Major-General\r\nBurton Forster’s diary gives interesting details. “During the night\r\nof the 23rd-24th many camels fell down and were left behind. Halts\r\nwere numerous, and we had a very hard and awkward march in the dim\r\nmoonlight through the grass and scrub till 11.30 P.M. The _rouse_\r\nsounded at 4 A.M. (24th) and we started at 5, having come about 9\r\nmiles from Abu Klea. We marched till about 9.30, seeing only a few\r\nof the enemy’s scouts in the afternoon, and halted about 18 miles\r\nfrom Abu Klea. The vedettes fired at them and they disappeared. We\r\nstarted again at 5 P.M., and marched on till midnight, rested on the\r\n25th till 5 P.M., when we started again, halting at 9.30 P.M. after\r\ndoing 13 miles. Next morning we started at 6 A.M. and reached Gakdul\r\nabout noon.... The work has been stiff and hot, especially on a daily\r\nration of three-quarters of a gallon of water!... I think the march\r\nof 56 miles in 64 hours is very creditable to Buller’s column.... The\r\nmen have been in their clothes without changing or washing from the\r\n16th to the 26th, and it has told on them: they are not as fit about\r\nthe feet as we could wish. Some of the officers succeeded in changing\r\ntheir socks once during the ten days, and were more comfortable in\r\nconsequence.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the retreat is given in a letter written\r\nfrom Gakdul on February 27, 1885, by Colonel B. J. C. Doran, C.B.,\r\nthen a subaltern in the first battalion, Royal Irish regiment.\r\n\r\n  “You will see by the address that we have commenced retracing\r\n  our steps towards Korti, we arrived here yesterday morning and\r\n  very thankful we all were to get in. The march back has been so\r\n  far anything but comfortable, and our march going up was child’s\r\n  play compared with this retreat, for of course then the regiment\r\n  was by itself in two detachments and could consequently move\r\n  pretty quickly having only a small amount of transport to hamper\r\n  it, but marching with the ‘Desert Column’ as it is called, is\r\n  quite another thing, besides having a large Hospital of sick and\r\n  wounded to take care of. We left Abu Klea on the 23rd in two\r\n  parties; the first consisting of the Hospitals and the whole\r\n  of the baggage, rations, &c., for the column escorted by some\r\n  mounted infantry started at 2 P.M. I went with this lot, as I\r\n  am acting Quartermaster now to the regiment. The second party\r\n  consisted of all the troops and did not start till 7 P.M.: they\r\n  had no baggage or transport to hinder them, so of course when\r\n  they started were able to catch us up, as they did about 8 or 9\r\n  miles out of Abu Klea where we halted and where a depôt of water\r\n  had been left; they got in about 1 A.M. We started off again at\r\n  daylight and marched till about 10 A.M., when the whole column\r\n  halted, pretty well done up; the water question all along has\r\n  been a very difficult affair. We were to rest here until 4 P.M.,\r\n  when we were again to start off, however just as everyone had\r\n  made themselves as comfortable as is possible on these occasions\r\n  under a blanket to keep off the sun and were just getting a\r\n  few winks of sleep, we were startled at hearing heavy firing\r\n  going on in our rear; it was at some distance but the sound of\r\n  cannon being fired was quite distinct, everyone was up like a\r\n  shot, and orders were given to get all baggage loaded ready to\r\n  move off at once. However, after half an hour’s excitement we\r\n  desisted, as it was discovered to be only about two men and a boy\r\n  (natives) amusing themselves--we presume to frighten us--with\r\n  some gunpowder in cases. To understand the cause of all this\r\n  alarm, you must know that ever since the night we were potted at\r\n  the natives still hovered around Abu Klea, and we only moved out\r\n  just in time. Had we stayed there another day, we should have\r\n  had a good fight, for just as the column I was with was about\r\n  to start, from one of the outlying posts on the neighbouring\r\n  hills it was signalled down that the enemy were seen advancing\r\n  from Metemmeh direction in thousands; this caused a good deal\r\n  of excitement; however, after coming within about 2 miles of\r\n  our advanced posts, they all halted and settled down for the\r\n  night. Meanwhile the column with sick and wounded got away and\r\n  were well clear of all the hills and in a fine open desert by\r\n  the time it was dark, and where we halted, as I said before, we\r\n  were joined by all the remainder of the garrison that night,\r\n  they having sneaked out under cover of the dusk. All the wells\r\n  we filled up and left fires burning so as to deceive the enemy.\r\n  I don’t suppose they found out we had gone until next morning,\r\n  and then pretty late, as they would not have approached the place\r\n  except very cautiously. It was a very nasty place to get out\r\n  of, as for about six miles the road or track runs in a valley\r\n  with commanding hills on both sides, and had the enemy made any\r\n  attempt to hold the ground at the head, where it emerges into the\r\n  desert, very few of us would have got out without scratches. Once\r\n  in the desert we did not mind how many came on us, so now you can\r\n  understand the commotion caused by the firing of cannon, as we\r\n  thought they must have found out and were following us. This of\r\n  course was almost impossible, as where they were encamped they\r\n  had only one or two wells which they must have dug, and they must\r\n  have wanted water, as they could not have got any since they left\r\n  the river at Metemmeh, and it would have taken them quite a day\r\n  to clear out the wells we had filled in at Abu Klea. In the first\r\n  24 hours after leaving Abu Klea we had done about 30 miles, not\r\n  bad going for a column on an allowance of water, in the desert\r\n  in fact. Everyone had to walk, except the sick and wounded,\r\n  because all the camels belonging to the camel corps and mounted\r\n  infantry had to be used for transport and baggage animals. There\r\n  were only just sufficient to bring us away, and nearly all of\r\n  them were completely played out before they commenced the march.\r\n  However, we struggled on somehow, and arrived here more dead than\r\n  alive. Thank goodness we are getting a day’s rest here, which\r\n  will enable the men to pull themselves together, get some decent\r\n  food and plenty of water to drink, and that good. If I had been\r\n  told a month ago that I should drink as filthy water as I have\r\n  done, day after day, and been very thankful to get it, I should\r\n  have laughed! The thickness of pea-soup was considered _good_:\r\n  sometimes, if it was thicker, then it might be a little bad,\r\n  but not to be thrown away. Considering all things, the desert\r\n  march has been _the_ most trying thing known in a campaign for\r\n  years. By the time we arrive at Korti, we shall have been away\r\n  five weeks or more. We shall not have so many difficulties to\r\n  contend with henceforward, as the next half will be much easier\r\n  and I doubt the enemy following us beyond this. Everything about\r\n  movements is kept a State secret here, and we don’t know what is\r\n  going to happen, except we move out of this to-morrow or next\r\n  day--they say to Merawi, to help the column gone up the River,\r\n  but I have my own idea that we are going straight to Korti,\r\n  though the Colonel told the officers on parade yesterday that\r\n  after a day’s rest here, we were to move towards Merawi. It\r\n  will be getting very hot here soon, and if we are to summer out\r\n  here, it would be advisable to try and build ourselves some sort\r\n  of shelter. However, I suppose when we get to Korti we shall\r\n  probably then know what government has settled to do about the\r\n  Soudan. I am sure if they only saw it, they would have no desire\r\n  ever to keep such a country!”\r\n\r\nAt Gakdul the Royal Irish had a comparatively pleasant rest. A\r\nquantity of stores had recently arrived from Korti, and as there was\r\nno means of carrying them back, the Commissariat distributed them\r\namong the troops, who were regaled on jam, cheese, fresh bread, fresh\r\nmeat, vegetables, and other long-forgotten delicacies. The men had\r\ntime to change their clothes, there was enough water for washing,\r\nand better than all, a great budget of letters from home awaited the\r\nregiment. Some of the units of the column started at once for Korti,\r\nbut it was not until the 2nd of March that the battalion was warned\r\nto start next day, an order which was very welcome, for the wells\r\nhad begun to give out, and “the water had become filled with living\r\nanimals, smelt, and was as fit to drink as a dirty duck pool!” From\r\nthe 5th to the 8th the Royal Irish halted at the wells of Megara,\r\nwhere a successful foray of desert robbers upon the slaughter cattle\r\nconsiderably reduced their rations of meat. Then they once more\r\npushed northward, this time in detachments, the last of which reached\r\nKorti on the 14th. As Lord Wolseley rode out to welcome them he saw\r\nmen whom a civilian would have derided as tramps and scarecrows, but\r\nin whom a soldier’s eye recognised troops of the finest quality.\r\nTheir uniforms hung in rags, patched where patching was possible with\r\nany material that had come to hand. Their boots were a nightmare.\r\nTheir skins were the colour of mahogany, their faces seamed with the\r\nlines which hunger and thirst, exposure to heat and cold, want of\r\nsleep, and prolonged exertion stamp upon every soldier in a campaign.\r\nTheir stern eyes, their hard-set mouths, their steady march and proud\r\ncarriage all showed that their spirit and discipline were as high as\r\never, and that the great fatigues of their marches in the desert had\r\nin no way impaired the efficiency of the Royal Irish. On the 16th\r\nLord Wolseley inspected the battalion, warmly thanked all ranks for\r\nthe work they had done, and informed them that General Buller had\r\nreported on them in the most favourable terms.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had done much towards keeping the _morale_ of the\r\nXVIIIth at the high standard maintained throughout the Nile campaign\r\nwas the Roman Catholic chaplain, the Reverend Father Brindle, D.S.O.,\r\nnow Bishop of Nottingham, whose name even now is one to conjure with\r\nin the Royal Irish regiment. After serving with the second battalion\r\nin the war of 1882, he accompanied the first battalion throughout\r\nthe whole of the expedition up the Nile. His genial personality,\r\nhis devotion to duty, his coolness in danger, his indifference to\r\nhardship, combined to give him a remarkable influence over the men,\r\nwhich he exerted invariably in the highest interests of the Service.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish thoroughly enjoyed the comparative civilisation of\r\nthe headquarters camp. They were once more under canvas; they had an\r\ninexhaustible supply of water; and they feasted their eyes, weary\r\nfrom the glare of the Bayuda desert, upon the palms and acacias\r\ngrowing on the narrow strip of cultivation which fringes both banks\r\nof the Nile. But they were not allowed to rest there long. When\r\nthe rear-guard of the desert column returned to Korti, the British\r\ngovernment were still determined to avenge Gordon and to crush the\r\nMahdi’s power at Khartoum; and Lord Wolseley arranged to concentrate\r\nthe expeditionary force for the summer in cantonments along the Nile\r\nnear Korti. The XVIIIth was assigned to a movable column, commanded\r\nby Brigadier-General Brackenbury, whose headquarters were at Debbeh,\r\nwith detachments in the neighbouring villages, one of which, Kurot,\r\nwas occupied by the Royal Irish, where they settled down, as they\r\nthought for many months. Some of their huts were made of logs, grass\r\nmats, and similar materials, bought from the natives and issued to\r\nthe troops; others were built of bricks, made out of the soil on the\r\nbanks of the river and dried in the sun. “The battalion,” writes an\r\nofficer who was present, “excelled at making the moulds for these\r\nbricks, and a sergeant, Kelly, was the crack moulder.” The want of\r\nstraw, however, proved as serious a hindrance to the brick-making\r\nof Wolseley’s troops as to the Israelites of old, for many thousand\r\nbricks cracked and were wasted. But only a fortnight after the last\r\nunit had reached its allotted post, Wolseley was warned by the\r\nCabinet that owing to the possibility of England being embroiled in\r\nwar elsewhere, the expedition to Khartoum might be abandoned, and on\r\nthe 11th of May he received orders to withdraw from the Soudan. He\r\nobeyed; but as the General-in-Chief in Egypt, who had been studying\r\nthe local situation for many months, he strongly protested against\r\nthe new policy, pointing out that if we retreated the Mahdi’s power\r\nwould greatly increase, and that the British government would not\r\nonly have to reinforce the garrison of Egypt, but to fight for\r\nthe protection of that country. The difficulty of carrying out\r\nthe evacuation was greatly increased by the necessity of bringing\r\nback about thirteen thousand natives, who, having thrown in their\r\nlot with us, could not be abandoned to the tender mercies of the\r\nMahdists; but by dint of careful organisation and hard work the task\r\nwas accomplished. General Brackenbury’s command started on the 1st\r\nof June in whale-boats for Abu Fatmeh, where three hundred men of\r\nthe XVIIIth, under Lieutenant-Colonel Wray, were landed, and after\r\nmarching some distance down the Nile rejoined the remainder of the\r\nbattalion. Though the difficulties were light compared to those of\r\nthe upward voyage, they were by no means insignificant, for the\r\n_voyageurs_ had gone back to Canada, and the Royal Irish, who acted\r\nas rear and baggage guard to the column, had much work in towing\r\nand mending whale-boats, wrecked or damaged in shooting the rapids.\r\nWhen the battalion reached Alexandria, it was joined by a strong\r\ndraft: a hundred and seventy-nine non-commissioned officers and men\r\nfrom the second battalion at Malta had landed in January, of whom\r\nfifty-eight had been fortunate enough to be sent to Suakim, where\r\nthey served as mounted infantry in the eastern Soudan. Thus by a\r\ncurious chance the Royal Irish were represented in the campaign of\r\n1884-85 not only on the Nile, but also on the shores of the Red Sea,\r\nwhere a young officer of the regiment, Lieutenant D. G. Gregorie,\r\nwho had already greatly distinguished himself while serving in the\r\nEgyptian army, was awarded the fourth class of the order of the\r\nOsmanieh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 8.\r\n\r\n  THE EGYPTIAN WAR\r\n  1882]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP N^o. 9.\r\n\r\n  THE NILE CAMPAIGN\r\n  1884-85\r\n\r\n  W. & A.K. Johnston Limited, Edinburgh & London.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of historical interest it may be mentioned that Lord\r\nWolseley’s predictions proved singularly correct. Within six months\r\nof our withdrawal from Dongola a large body of the enemy attempted\r\nthe invasion of Egypt, besieged for forty days a fort held by\r\nBritish troops, and did not retire southwards until on December 30,\r\n1885, they had been defeated at the battle of Ginniss. To meet this\r\nincursion it was found necessary to hurry nearly seven thousand\r\nBritish troops up the Nile, and to increase the garrison of Lower\r\nEgypt by about three thousand men.\r\n\r\nIn despatches Lord Wolseley mentioned the following officers of\r\nthe Royal Irish: Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw, V.C.; Captain Guinness,\r\nand Lieutenant B. J. C. Doran. Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw was awarded\r\nthe C.B.; Captain Guinness was promoted to a Brevet-Majority, and\r\nLieutenant B. J. C. Doran was noted for a Brevet-Majority on his\r\nattaining the rank of Captain. The Egyptian medal and clasp for the\r\nNile, 1884-85, and the Khedive’s Star were issued to all ranks. In\r\n1886, the regiment was permitted to add to its battle honours the\r\nwords, “Nile 1884-5,” in commemoration of the ascent of the River and\r\nthe operations in the Bayuda desert.\r\n\r\nThe first battalion, Royal Irish regiment embarked at Alexandria\r\non August 24, 1885, in the s.s. _Stirling Castle_, and arrived at\r\nPlymouth on September 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTALION.\r\n\r\n1883-1902.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK MOUNTAIN EXPEDITION: THE TIRAH CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1884, the second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment began\r\na long tour of foreign service. Its first station was at Malta, where\r\ndrafts from home brought up its numbers to a total of nine hundred\r\nand sixty-seven of all ranks.[266] While at Malta, the battalion\r\nheard that the expedition, described in Chapter xii., was to be\r\nsent to the relief of Gordon at Khartoum, and hoped to be included\r\nin it, but the War Office decided otherwise; and though the Royal\r\nIrish were represented in the Nile column, the honour, as we have\r\nseen, fell to the first, not to the second battalion, which remained\r\nstationary till January 7, 1885, when leaving a large detachment as a\r\nreinforcement for the first battalion in Egypt, it sailed for Bombay,\r\nand early in February reached Umballa with a strength of six hundred\r\nand fifty-two of all ranks.\r\n\r\nA month later the battalion was ordered up to Rawal Pindi to increase\r\nthe number of British regiments at a _durbar_, which the Amir of\r\nAfghanistan was to attend. On the journey the Royal Irish were\r\nin a very alarming railway accident: part of the troop train ran\r\noff the line--three bandsmen, Moore, Tod, and Frost, were killed;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Dawson was seriously injured; Major Hamilton,\r\nLieutenant Symonds, Surgeon-Major Pratt, Bandsman Hayes, and\r\nDrummer Brennan were also hurt. As soon as the _durbar_ was over\r\nthe battalion proceeded to Subathu, where, with a detachment at\r\nJutogh, it remained until November, 1887, when it changed stations\r\nfor Nowshera, with detachments at Fort Attock and Cherat. While on\r\nthe march the Royal Irish were annoyed by thieves, who hung about\r\nthe outskirts of the camp in the hope of stealing modern firearms,\r\nfor which there was a constant demand among the hillmen beyond the\r\nfrontier. To keep their rifles safe, the soldiers before going to\r\nsleep at night used to tie or strap them to their legs, but even this\r\nprecaution sometimes failed. On one occasion a small detachment\r\nsecured their firearms in the usual way when they turned into their\r\n“E. P.” tent; but one of the party was not well, and to let him rest\r\ncomfortably a comrade slept with both his own and his friend’s rifle\r\nfastened to him. In the middle of the night the Good Samaritan woke,\r\nfeeling that some one was stealthily touching him; he instantly\r\nraised an alarm, when down fell the tent, and before the men could\r\ncrawl from beneath the heavy folds of canvas, the thieves made off\r\nwith a rifle. On investigation it was found that the robbers had\r\nnoiselessly undone all the tent ropes with the exception of the four\r\ncorner ones, which, when their presence in camp was discovered,\r\nthey had cut through to cover their retreat. The Royal Irish took\r\nsuch stern measures to prevent further thefts that the thieves for\r\na considerable time avoided a battalion which they described as a\r\n“_Shaitan ki pultan aur Sahiblog bahut zaberdust_.” This may be\r\ntranslated freely--The Devil’s own regiment with very high-handed\r\nofficers!\r\n\r\nDuring the time the second battalion was at Nowshera, one of its\r\nsubalterns, Lieutenant W. Gloster, did a very daring piece of\r\nwork. He had become noted for his good military sketching, and was\r\nspecially selected to do reconnaissance work across the border beyond\r\nour frontier post at Hoti Maidan. His instructions were those which\r\nmany officers before and since have received when sent on similar\r\nenterprises: he was told that though it was most desirable that the\r\nwork should be done, the government would not be responsible for\r\nhim: and that on no account was he to cause trouble on the border:\r\nif he liked to apply to the Guides at Hoti Maidan for an escort he\r\nmight do so, but in all probability his request would be refused. The\r\ncommandant at Hoti Maidan declined to help him, saying that if an\r\nescort of the Guides showed themselves beyond our frontier the whole\r\nof the country might break into a flame. Nothing daunted, Gloster in\r\nsome mysterious way made friends with several of the Headmen along\r\nthe border. “How he did it,” writes the officer who describes the\r\nadventure, “I don’t know, as he couldn’t speak a word of any language\r\nbut English, and his only mode of conversation with his Pathan pals\r\nwas a tremendous slap on the back, and ‘How are you, old cock?’ One\r\nnight he was taken across the frontier by one of his new friends,\r\nmade his sketch in the early hours of the morning, and was back\r\non British territory just as his presence was discovered and the\r\ntribesmen were assembling to cut him off.”\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1888, Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Wray, who had been in\r\ncommand since January 9, 1887, died suddenly of heart disease, and\r\nwas succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel G. W. N. Rogers.\r\n\r\nThe second battalion in September, 1888, was called upon to take part\r\nin a punitive expedition beyond the north-west frontier of India.\r\nHazara, a wild and rugged district on the left bank of the river\r\nIndus, about eighty miles east of Peshawar, had long been disturbed\r\nby the lawless conduct of some of the tribes of mountaineers\r\ninhabiting the no-man’s land beyond our border. The Akazais, the Khan\r\nKhel of the Hassanzais and the Alaiwals raided into our country,\r\nlooted the villages, and killed peaceful British subjects; and though\r\npunished by the infliction of fines and by being “blockaded”--_i.e._,\r\ndebarred from bringing their produce into British territory, they\r\ndid not mend their ways. Growing bolder from comparative immunity,\r\nthey brought matters to a head by attacking and killing a party of\r\nofficers and men who were surveying a part of the Black mountain,\r\nwithin the Queen’s dominions. To avenge these two Englishmen and\r\nthe Gurkha soldiers who were murdered with them; to maintain our\r\nprestige in India, and to prevent an outbreak on other parts of the\r\nnorth-west frontier, a considerable force was mobilised and placed\r\nunder the command of Brigadier-General J. W. M‘Queen, C.B., A.D.C. It\r\nconsisted of three mountain batteries (two British and one native), a\r\ncompany of Sappers and Miners, the 1st battalion of the Suffolk, and\r\nthe second battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Irish,\r\nand Royal Sussex regiments, eight battalions of native infantry,\r\nand a native pioneer battalion. These troops were organised in two\r\nbrigades, commanded respectively by Brigadier-Generals C. N. Channer,\r\nV.C., and W. Galbraith; and to meet the requirements of mountain\r\nwarfare, in which it is impossible for one man to supervise the\r\nmovements of a large body of soldiers, the brigades were subdivided\r\ninto two columns, to each of which a British battalion, 600 strong,\r\nand two native regiments were allotted. A native cavalry regiment,\r\nthe second battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders, and a native\r\ninfantry regiment formed the reserve. The Royal Irish, whom Major\r\nBrereton commanded until Lieutenant-Colonel Rogers returned from\r\nleave at home, were in the fourth column,[267] the other units of\r\nwhich were part of a British mountain battery, three companies of\r\nthe 34th Pioneers, the 4th and 29th Punjab Native infantry, with a\r\nfield hospital and a detachment of military telegraphists. The whole\r\nforce, including some Kashmiri troops and three hundred of the Khyber\r\nrifles, numbered 272 officers and 12,282 non-commissioned officers\r\nand men; the strength of the fourth column was 51 officers and 2414\r\nof the other ranks.\r\n\r\nThe immediate object of the expedition was the punishment of the Khan\r\nKhel and the Akazais, whose watch-towers and villages were perched\r\namong the crags and precipices of the range which, in some places\r\nrising to a height of more than 9000 feet, cuts off the valley of\r\nAgror from the left bank of the Indus. It was decided to penetrate\r\ninto this maze of mountains from two directions: three columns of\r\nthe Hazara Field force, after concentrating at Ughi, the chief\r\nBritish outpost in the Agror valley, were to cross the range from\r\neast to west, while the fourth column, commanded by Colonel A. C. W.\r\nCrookshank, was to assemble fifteen miles to the south-west of Ughi\r\nat Derband, our frontier village on the Indus, and push northwards\r\nup the left bank of the river.[268] As this detachment could not\r\nbe expected to join hands with the main body for several days, it\r\nwas accompanied by General Galbraith, who, while leaving to Colonel\r\nCrookshank the actual handling of the troops, took charge of the\r\ngeneral operations. Though there was little definite information\r\nconcerning the prospective theatre of war, it was known that the\r\nroads were impracticable for any but mule transport; so baggage was\r\nreduced to a minimum; no tents were taken, and regimental officers\r\nwere cut down to fifty, the lower ranks to sixteen pounds weight of\r\nkit. The main body had with it five days’ supplies and a hundred\r\nrounds of ammunition per man, seventy on the person of the soldier,\r\nthirty on mule-back. As the fourth column to some extent was acting\r\nindependently, its supply was increased to seven days, and the\r\nnumber of rounds carried by mules was doubled. A general reserve of\r\na hundred rounds per man was formed at the base.\r\n\r\nThe fourth column had finished its concentration on October 1, and\r\non the morning of the 2nd, Galbraith advanced seven miles into\r\nthe enemy’s country and bivouacked at Chamb, on a site he had\r\nreconnoitred while awaiting the arrival of his troops. Here he was\r\ninformed by telegraph that owing to delays in bringing up stores to\r\nUghi he was to make no forward movement for twenty-four hours, so\r\nafter his mountain guns, escorted by four companies of the Royal\r\nIrish, had driven the enemy from the neighbouring hills, he improved\r\nthe track leading from his bivouac into the valley of the Indus.\r\nBefore dawn on the 4th, he had secured his right flank by crowning\r\nthe heights with a detachment of native infantry, and as soon as it\r\nwas light the advance-guard--two companies of the Royal Irish under\r\nCaptain Lysaght--began to descend into the gorge of the river.[269]\r\nAt 8 A.M. the advance-guard had reached comparatively open ground,\r\nwhere Lysaght halted to allow the remainder of the troops to come\r\nup; then he pushed on again, and an hour later a few of the enemy\r\nopened fire from the village of Shingri. The Royal Irish extended\r\nto the left of the hamlet, two companies of native infantry made a\r\nsimilar movement to the right, and with little difficulty and small\r\nloss the outpost was routed and dispersed. For another mile nothing\r\nwas seen of the enemy, but when the advance-guard approached the next\r\nvillage, Towara, the hillmen were found awaiting our attack. Across\r\nthe valley, here about twelve hundred yards in width, stretched their\r\nfirst line: the right rested on a patch of jungle growing amidst the\r\nboulders on the river bank; the left was posted on the crags of the\r\nlowest tier of the bare and arid mountains which form the eastern\r\nwall of the gorge of the Indus. Rather less than a mile above Towara\r\nthe valley was completely closed by a steep spur or under-feature,\r\non the far end of which the village of Kotkai, built on a huge mass\r\nof broken rocks, commanded not only the spur itself, but also the\r\nbed of the river, the hillmen’s line of retreat and the only track\r\nby which the British could continue to force their way northward\r\nup the left bank. On this spur the enemy, whose total strength was\r\ncomputed at 4000 fighting men,[270] had established his second line\r\nin well-built sangars; and on the eastern hills lurked about a\r\nthousand sharpshooters, armed with rifle and matchlocks, whose fire\r\nupon the valley below them would cross with that of a detachment of\r\nequal strength, posted in breastworks on the heights overhanging the\r\nwestern bank. Against the hillmen who held this formidable position\r\nGeneral Galbraith could bring into action only his mountain guns, a\r\ncouple of Gatlings, and about fourteen hundred foot soldiers, as the\r\nremainder of his men were employed in guarding the baggage and in\r\ncrowning the hills in rear of the column.\r\n\r\nGalbraith’s first care was to rid his flanks of the enemy. Covered\r\nby the fire of the guns and the steady and well-directed volleys of\r\nthe Royal Irish, the 34th Pioneers drove the hillmen from the jungle\r\non the left, while the 4th Punjab infantry scaled the precipitous\r\nheights on the right, pushing the foe before them in confusion. But\r\nthe process took time, and it was not until 1 P.M. that the Royal\r\nIrish were allowed to move towards the enemy in the plain, where many\r\nflags showed that the tribesmen were assembled in large numbers. When\r\nthe battalion had gained six hundred yards it was halted behind a\r\nlow stone wall, and ordered to open upon the foe in front of them,\r\nwhile the guns shelled the defenders of the Kotkai ridge. By this\r\ntime, the flanking detachments had done their work and were once more\r\nlevel with the troops in the centre, and Galbraith, considering that\r\nthe hillmen were sufficiently shaken to warrant his assaulting their\r\nfirst position, ordered a general advance. With perfect steadiness\r\nthe Royal Irish moved forward with sloped arms towards a clump of\r\ntrees three or four hundred yards distant; the mountaineers who held\r\nthis part of the line were beginning to fall back, when the word\r\n“Charge” was shouted by some unauthorised person whose identity has\r\nnever been discovered; the call was sounded by a bugler, and with a\r\nwild yell the battalion dashed forward. They had covered some fifty\r\nyards of ground, when from a nullah about eighty yards off emerged\r\na horde of swordsmen, Hindustani fanatics, each of whom had sworn\r\nto gain Heaven that day by slaying at least one of the Unbelievers.\r\nThe suddenness of their appearance, their demoniacal yells and\r\nheadlong rush might have startled any troops, but the Royal Irish\r\nwere staunch; after an instant of surprised inaction the company\r\ncommanders ordered their men to fire independently, and then to meet\r\nthe rush with the bayonet. An officer thus described the affair in\r\nhis diary: “We got the word to charge; the men went at them with a\r\nwill, bayoneting or shooting every Ghazi within reach. The swordsmen\r\nthen wheeled away as if they did not quite relish us, and went\r\ntowards the 34th Pioneers, who fell back a bit at first but then\r\npulled themselves together. Our men wheeled up of their own accord\r\nand followed the Ghazis, and I don’t think many got away. We killed\r\nor wounded about a hundred.[271] In the pursuit Gloster with one or\r\ntwo dare-devils of his company dashed after one of the enemy who was\r\ncarrying a standard, shot him down, and brought back the flag in\r\ntriumph.”[272]\r\n\r\nAfter the main body of the enemy had been dispersed, several\r\nincidents occurred characteristic of warfare on the north-west\r\nfrontier of India. When the fighting appeared to be over, a medical\r\nofficer, seeing a sepoy lying hard hit on the plain, went off alone\r\nto dress his wounds, and suddenly found himself surrounded by five\r\nGhazis; one he brought down with his revolver; the others circled\r\nround him, waiting their chance to dash in and hack him to pieces.\r\nThe Royal Irish at that moment were re-forming their ranks; a patrol\r\nof an officer and four men hurried to the doctor’s rescue, and shot\r\nthree of the fanatics; the fourth came on most pluckily, and was only\r\nten yards from our men when one of them shot him, and then pinned\r\nhim to the ground with his bayonet. These hillmen are wonderfully\r\ntenacious of life, and although the Ghazi had a Martini bullet\r\nthrough his chest and a bayonet wound in his stomach he strove up\r\nto his last gasp to kill his hated foes. A little later in the day\r\nGeneral Galbraith was the hero of an adventure in which the good\r\nmarksmanship of the battalion undoubtedly saved his life. While the\r\nRoyal Irish were sitting on the ground in quarter-column, waiting\r\nfor orders, the General on foot, unarmed, and with no escort but\r\nhis aide-de-camp who was mounted, walked over the battlefield to\r\nascertain from two friendly hillmen who accompanied him if any of the\r\ndead belonged to tribes which were nominally neutral.\r\n\r\n  “Suddenly [writes an officer] we heard some shots fired, and\r\n  looking up we saw about two or three hundred yards off the\r\n  General running as hard as he could towards us, closely followed\r\n  by some Ghazis. The A.D.C.’s pony had became unmanageable so he\r\n  could not fire, and the Ghazis were catching the General up; we\r\n  accordingly ordered two or three picked shots to fire--risky\r\n  work, for the fanatics were within a few yards of the General and\r\n  he almost masked our fire. Still the risk had to be taken, and\r\n  (luckily perhaps) as we fired, the General stumbled and fell,\r\n  and the whole of the Ghazis were shot. We heard afterwards that\r\n  when the General was examining the corpses, two of the supposed\r\n  ‘deaders’ had jumped up and gone for him, and being unarmed, he\r\n  could do nothing but run. The ‘friendlies,’ seeing the General’s\r\n  plight, had gone for the Ghazis, and as they were all dressed\r\n  alike, we were unable to tell friend from foe, and had shot all\r\n  four of them.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon a hospital was established in a clump\r\nof trees, among which stood a shrine packed with the furniture and\r\nother belongings of some of the tribesmen with whom we were at war.\r\nFrom one of these trees a Ghazi was dislodged by a bullet; the sound\r\nof the shot brought up a couple of our men who, suspecting that more\r\nfanatics were in hiding, began to rummage among the lumber in the\r\nshrine, where two more Ghazis were discovered to whom very short\r\nshrift was allowed. When the advance was resumed, half the battalion\r\nwas ordered to keep down the fire from the sangars on the right bank\r\nof the river, while the other companies and part of the 29th Punjab\r\ninfantry climbed the ridge and moved upon Kotkai. They entered it\r\nwithout opposition, for the enemy, already shaken by the shells of\r\nthe mountain battery, retired before them to Kunhar, a village two or\r\nthree miles higher up the river. By the time we were in possession of\r\nthe Kotkai position the day was so far spent that pursuit had become\r\nimpossible, and the wing of the Royal Irish was sent down to bivouac\r\nin the plain, while the native regiment remained to hold the village\r\nas an advanced post.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were full of varied occupations. The battalion\r\nmarched with convoys of sick to Chamb, carried stores over rocks\r\nthat the mules could not face, escorted the General up precipitous\r\nmountains when he visited tribes of doubtful loyalty to arrange the\r\nterms on which their neutrality was to be secured, and for more than\r\none day carried on a long musketry fight with the hillmen, who had\r\nnow flocked to the farther side of the river, whence they maintained\r\na harassing fire upon our working parties. Under the steady shooting\r\nof the Royal Irish, the enemy gradually melted away, and when the\r\nBritish brought river craft up the Indus to replace the ferry-boats\r\nwhich had been destroyed, the mountaineers realised that the river\r\nwas no longer an impassable barrier and disappeared, leaving the\r\nroad-makers unmolested in their heavy task of converting mere\r\ngoat-tracks on the side of a cliff into roads wide enough for the\r\npassage of heavily laden mules in single file. On the 11th the whole\r\ncolumn reached Kunhar, though the road was still so rough that over\r\nthe greater part of it the baggage had to be passed by hand. The 12th\r\nwas spent in improving the path to Gazikot, a mile or two higher up\r\nthe river; and on the 13th, Galbraith transported the Royal Irish\r\nand part of his native infantry across the river in boats, marched\r\nthrough various deserted villages, and blew up a hill fortress at\r\nMaidan. The tribesmen watched his proceedings from the neighbouring\r\nheights, and when he began to retire attacked his rear-guard, but\r\nwere driven back, and the column regained the left bank without\r\ndifficulty. After the destruction of Maidan the enemy began to lose\r\nheart, and though the troops in the fourth column made several raids\r\ninto the mountains on each side of the Indus, occupying villages so\r\nfilthy that the Europeans could not sleep in the houses and had to\r\nbivouac upon the roofs, they did not again come under hostile fire.\r\nOn all these operations the Royal Irish were employed, and in their\r\nspare time Galbraith found plenty of occupation for them in the\r\nunexciting but very arduous work of improving the communications with\r\nthe frontier of India.\r\n\r\nWhile the fourth column was forcing its way up the Indus the other\r\ncolumns pushed eastwards from the Agror valley. They climbed\r\nmountains, made roads, destroyed watch-towers, and burned hostile\r\nvillages with small loss, for they met with no opposition such as\r\nthat which had awaited Galbraith at Kotkai, and their casualties were\r\nmainly caused by the “snipers” who harassed their bivouacs at night.\r\nThus taken between two fires, the Hassanzais and Akazais learned\r\nthat though slow to rouse, the Government of India when it begins to\r\nstrike, does so with effect. Astonished to find that the fastnesses\r\nof the country could be reached by regular troops, dismayed at the\r\nloss of several hundred of their fighting men, and realising that the\r\nlonger they deferred their submission, the heavier would be their\r\npunishment, these clans decided to surrender; paid the heavy fines\r\nimposed upon them, and promised amendment for the future. During the\r\nnegotiations there was an episode in which Lieutenant Gloster played\r\nan amusing part, thus described by one of his brother officers--\r\n\r\n  “When the hillmen with whom we had been fighting came to the\r\n  conclusion that for the time being they had had enough of\r\n  it, they began to send Jirgahs or deputations of headmen to\r\n  interview General Galbraith, who had very little knowledge of\r\n  the manners and customs of the Border tribes. Presuming on his\r\n  ignorance of frontier etiquette, they used to behave towards\r\n  him with gross impertinence: they would walk into his hut and\r\n  greet his Pathan orderlies, who acted as interpreters, with\r\n  great respect, but take no notice of the General himself; then\r\n  sit down without being asked, and finally spit on the floor--a\r\n  particularly gross form of insult throughout the East. Gloster\r\n  who since the engagement at Kotkai had been orderly officer to\r\n  the General, was present at these interviews and used to boil\r\n  with rage, but as his chief took no notice he had to swallow his\r\n  wrath as best he could. But Gloster’s chance came when Colonel\r\n  ----, an officer of long experience on the frontier, joined the\r\n  column and took over the conduct of the negotiations for peace.\r\n  On the morning after Colonel ----’s arrival the tribesmen walked\r\n  into the new-comer’s hut with their usual swagger and went\r\n  through their customary insulting performances--but not for long,\r\n  as Colonel ---- turned upon them, first with a volley of abuse\r\n  in Hindustani and Pushtu, and then with his stick and boots. In\r\n  amazement they made for the door, and then as each astonished\r\n  Pathan passed out, he got a blow on the side of the head from a\r\n  huge fist, followed by a hearty kick from a long and powerful\r\n  leg. A very chastened and exceedingly polite deputation returned\r\n  to make terms next day!”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Hassanzais and Akazais had made their peace with the\r\nIndian government, a portion of General M‘Queen’s command moved\r\nnorthwards to punish other recalcitrant tribes; but as the fourth\r\ncolumn played no part in these operations it is not necessary to\r\ndescribe them. As far as the Royal Irish are concerned, the only\r\nincident during the remainder of the Black Mountain campaign was\r\nthe visit of the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir Frederick\r\nRoberts, who on the 28th of October inspected the second battalion\r\nat Palosi, and complimented all ranks on their behaviour during this\r\nlittle mountain war. Early in November the expedition had finished\r\nits work; the columns marched back across the British frontier,\r\nand the Royal Irish, passing through Durband, arrived at their old\r\nstation of Nowshera on the 23rd of the month.[273]\r\n\r\nGeneral Galbraith in a farewell order thanked all ranks of the fourth\r\ncolumn for the admirable manner in which they had performed their\r\nduties, adding that their exemplary behaviour and unvarying good\r\ndiscipline had not been less conspicuous than their conduct in the\r\nfield. His official report on the operations of the river column\r\nmentioned Major R. K. Brereton and Lieutenant W. Gloster, Royal Irish\r\nregiment, and the Roman Catholic chaplain attached to the battalion,\r\nFather Francis Van Mansfeld, who during the fighting on October 4,\r\ndistinguished himself by carrying water to the wounded under a heavy\r\nfire. The losses of the Hazara Field force during this short campaign\r\nwere small: the total casualties, including two officers mortally\r\nwounded, were less than a hundred. In the second battalion of the\r\nRoyal Irish two men were killed and three wounded in action, while\r\ntwo were fatally injured by falling down a precipice.[274] The\r\nIndian Medal with a clasp for “Hazara 1888” was granted to the troops\r\nwho took part in this expedition.\r\n\r\nUntil December, 1889, the second battalion remained at Nowshera;\r\nthen it was stationed for a short time at Peshawar, and in April,\r\n1890, headquarters and four companies were moved to Cherat, where\r\nthe medals for the Hazara campaign were presented on parade by Mrs\r\nRogers, the wife of the officer who then commanded the battalion.\r\nThe year 1890 was memorable in the sporting annals of the regiment.\r\nAfter having been in the final tie for the Infantry polo tournament\r\nfor three years running, the officers of the second battalion won\r\nit at Umballa with a team composed of Captain Apthorp, Lieutenants\r\nCullinan, Kellett, Wynne, and Garraway--the last mentioned taking\r\nthe place of Wynne, who met with an accident during the game. The\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men also had a triumph in winning\r\nthe Calcutta football tournament. The month of December found the\r\nsecond battalion on the way to Lucknow, where they remained till\r\nNovember, 1894, when a five weeks’ march brought them to Jubbulpore,\r\nan excellent centre for big game shooting. The officers lost no\r\nopportunity of going after tiger, and Lieutenant J. B. S. Alderson\r\nhad a very exciting adventure in which his life was saved by the\r\ncoolness of Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence, then in command of the\r\nbattalion. In the Chitri jungle Alderson was following up a wounded\r\ntiger on foot, when the beast charged and seized him by the arm.\r\nColonel Lawrence rushed to the rescue, and with three steady shots\r\nkilled it, but not without much difficulty, for as the huge brute\r\nlay upon Alderson mauling his arm, the bullets had to be placed so\r\nthat they would strike the animal without doing his victim any harm.\r\nWhen Alderson was brought into hospital, he was so weak from shock,\r\nfatigue, and loss of blood that it was pronounced unsafe to put him\r\nunder chloroform, and it was nearly midnight before all his numerous\r\nwounds were dressed. Though suffering agonies he never uttered a\r\nword, except from time to time to ask one of his brother officers,\r\nwho were standing round his bed, to fill and light the pipe, which\r\nhe did not allow to go out during the operation. His right arm had\r\nbeen bitten through, but neither the bones nor arteries were injured,\r\nand he recovered--to meet a soldier’s death a few years later in the\r\nSouth African war.\r\n\r\nDuring the cold weather of 1896-97 the second battalion was inspected\r\nby the Lieutenant-General commanding in Bengal, who pronounced it to\r\nbe “in first-rate order, in a very efficient condition, and quite\r\nfit for active service.” The Commander-in-Chief in India considered\r\nthis “a very satisfactory report on the battalion, which appears to\r\nbe very well commanded by Colonel Lawrence.” A few months after this\r\ninspection matters began to go badly on the frontier, where for some\r\ntime past fanatical priests had been preaching “a Holy War” against\r\nthe English. The first tangible symptom of unrest was a treacherous\r\nattack by the hillmen of the Tochi valley upon a British officer\r\nand his escort; then followed an outbreak in the Swat valley, where\r\nthe tribes suddenly fell in thousands upon our post at Malakand. The\r\ngarrison fought gallantly, and in spite of enormous odds held their\r\nground for several days until the enemy were dispersed by a relieving\r\ncolumn. The Mohmands were the next to rise, and finally the Afridis\r\nand Orakzais took up arms against us. To meet this formidable though\r\nfortunately ill-combined attack, troops were hurried to the frontier;\r\namong them were the Royal Irish, who on August 13, 1897, received\r\nthe order to mobilise for active service. The news was welcomed by\r\nthe battalion with wild enthusiasm, and proved so good a tonic to\r\nthe large number of non-commissioned officers and men who, though\r\napparently recovered from the malarial fever prevalent at Jubbulpore,\r\nstill had the seeds of the disease lurking in their system, that\r\neight hundred and twenty-seven of all ranks were passed by the\r\ndoctors.[275] In two days everything was in readiness, and on August\r\n15, the Royal Irish entrained for Rawal Pindi. The journey, at that\r\ntime of year always an exhausting one, was made doubly trying by the\r\nresult of a railway accident; the troop trains, timed to reach Pindi\r\nearly in the morning, did not arrive there till nearly midnight,\r\nand by some departmental blunder the battalion was left all day\r\nwithout food or shelter from the sun. At Khasalghur, where the rail\r\nended, the Royal Irish had very heavy work, loading and reloading\r\nstores in extreme heat. Then followed several forced marches, in the\r\nfirst of which they escorted a convoy four or five miles in length\r\nfor twenty-six miles over a very rugged country, drained by two\r\nrivers passable only at deep fords. When they joined Major-General\r\nYeatman-Biggs in the Miranzai valley, they found his column at Hangu,\r\na village at the base of the foot hills of the great Samana ridge,\r\nwhere the camp, pitched on fields from which the crops had just been\r\nreaped, stood on ground saturated by the heavy rain of the monsoon.\r\nIn a previous campaign on the frontier, an imperfectly entrenched\r\nBritish force had been attacked at night by a horde of hillmen, whose\r\ndetermined rush was not repelled without great difficulty and hard\r\nfighting. Mindful of this episode, Yeatman-Biggs had ringed his camp\r\nwith works, which were occupied by the troops at night, when, to\r\navoid offering a target to “snipers,” the tents were struck. As the\r\nweather was very wet and steamy, it was impossible for the men ever\r\nto get their clothes thoroughly dried, and during the fortnight that\r\nthe headquarters of the battalion remained at Hangu there was much\r\nfever among those who were unlucky enough to be left in camp,[276]\r\nbut the companies sent on detachment kept in good health and\r\naccomplished the remarkable marches mentioned in Colonel Lawrence’s\r\norder, quoted in appendix 5.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of September 12, General Yeatman-Biggs issued orders\r\nfor his column to march forthwith to the rescue of a party of the\r\n36th Sikhs, who were hard pressed in Fort Gulistan, an advanced post\r\non the Samana ridge. At that moment the battalion was so reduced by\r\ndetachments and by sickness that only two hundred and ninety-five\r\nRoyal Irishmen were present to take part in the arduous operations\r\nby which the Gulistan garrison was relieved on the 13th. After this\r\nsuccess Yeatman-Biggs was ordered to remain on the Samana; the sick\r\nof the battalion were sent up from the hospitals below, and in the\r\npure air of the mountains rapidly regained their health. In addition\r\nto the ordinary camp guards, duties, and fatigues the battalion was\r\nemployed in road-making and in reconnaissances among the hills; and\r\nin high spirits and absolutely unaware that they had been reported\r\nupon unfavourably, all ranks anxiously awaited orders for a farther\r\nadvance into the enemy’s country, when a telegram reached Colonel\r\nLawrence from a civilian friend at Rawal Pindi, telling him of a\r\nrumour that the Royal Irish were to be ordered back from the front\r\nfor garrison duty in India. Colonel Lawrence at once went to the\r\nGeneral, who said it was true that the battalion was to go back,\r\nas the doctors reported it to be saturated with malaria. At the\r\nColonel’s request a medical board was assembled, whose members were\r\ninstructed to be very thorough and searching in their examination,\r\nand to pass no one who was not thoroughly fit for the hard work of\r\nactive service. The doctors did not see the whole of the battalion,\r\nas a hundred and fifty officers and men were absent on detachment,\r\nbut out of those whom they inspected, five hundred and twenty-three\r\nwere passed as absolutely fit, and above the average physique of\r\nthe army. With this favourable report in his hand, Colonel Lawrence\r\nmade every effort to obtain the recision of the order but without\r\nsuccess; and on September 30, appeared the following paragraph in\r\nMajor-General Yeatman-Biggs’ Field Force orders: “under instructions\r\nfrom Army Headquarters, Simla, the 2nd battalion, Royal Irish\r\nregiment, is to proceed to Rawal Pindi for garrison duty, on relief\r\nby the 2nd Derbyshire regiment.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no reason was given for the removal of the\r\nbattalion from the fighting line; and soon after the Royal Irish\r\nreached Rawal Pindi rumours, most injurious to their character\r\nas soldiers, became current in civilian circles and found their\r\nway first into the Indian and then into the British newspapers.\r\nMajor-General Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, the Colonel of the regiment,\r\nwas in England when these rumours were repeated by the London press;\r\nand stirred to the heart by the aspersions on the fair fame of the\r\ncorps with which he had so long and honourable a connection, he\r\nhurried to India to investigate the truth of these stories. Shortly\r\nafter the second battalion returned to Rawal Pindi Colonel Lawrence\r\nwas appointed to the command of the XVIIIth regimental district;\r\nbut before leaving India he went to Simla to ascertain if possible\r\nwhy the battalion had been so unjustly treated. He was unable to\r\nobtain an interview with the Commander-in-Chief, but from the\r\nAdjutant-General he learned that, several days before the medical\r\nboard had been convened, General Yeatman-Biggs had reported that\r\nthe Royal Irish were so saturated with malaria that they could not\r\nkeep up with the rest of the column. As General Havelock-Allan and\r\nColonel Lawrence crossed on the voyage without meeting in any port,\r\nthe former landed at Bombay with an unbiassed mind; without stopping\r\nto see the battalion at Rawal Pindi he hastened to the frontier, and\r\nafter the fullest inquiries in every direction was able to assert\r\nproudly that the Royal Irish had behaved like good soldiers in the\r\nTirah campaign. By his tragic death in the Khyber Pass at the end of\r\nDecember, the regiment apparently lost its only influential friend\r\nin the East, and when, shortly afterwards, the authorities at Simla\r\nrefused to grant the board of inquiry for which Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nForster had applied in order to refute the libels on his battalion,\r\nthe spirits of all ranks sank very low. The dignified attitude of the\r\nofficers under misfortune won universal respect and admiration at\r\nPindi; and it speaks well for the discipline of the battalion that\r\nin such distressing circumstances there was no sign of angry feeling\r\namong the men, and that all ranks, knowing that there was no grounds\r\nfor the aspersions made against them in the press, possessed their\r\nsouls in patience until their conduct should be investigated by an\r\nauthority even higher than that of Simla.\r\n\r\nWhile Havelock-Allan was on the frontier he had laid the grievances\r\nof the Royal Irish before General Sir William Lockhart, who was\r\nin command of all the troops engaged in the Tirah campaign; and\r\nafter Lockhart had seen the battalion at Havelock-Allan’s funeral\r\nat Pindi, he exerted himself so vigorously on its behalf that,\r\nafter being closely inspected by the chief army doctor in India,\r\nit was ordered back to the front, and on February 9, 1898, joined\r\nthe third brigade, under Colonel (now Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nIan) Hamilton, in the Bara valley. Thence it moved up to Barkai,\r\nwhere the expeditionary force received the Royal Irish with open\r\narms. “The fuss that has been made over us is wonderful,” wrote\r\nan officer of the XVIIIth. “Every general within fifteen miles of\r\nBarkai rode over to congratulate the regiment in the names of their\r\nrespective commands, and the officers were inundated with shoals\r\nof complimentary telegrams.” Unfortunately, as far as Hamilton’s\r\nbrigade was concerned, all fighting was over when the battalion\r\nwas allowed to return to the front, and thus it had no opportunity\r\nof again meeting the enemy; but still it had been sent back to the\r\nfighting line, and thus from the military point of view its honour\r\nwas completely vindicated. One thing, however, was still needed to\r\nre-establish the second battalion in the eyes of civilians--a letter\r\nfrom Army headquarters at Simla clearing it from the charges made\r\nagainst it in the newspapers. Such a letter arrived on the 17th of\r\nFebruary, but being marked “confidential” could not be sent to the\r\npublic press for publication. When Colonel Lawrence received from\r\nthe second battalion a copy of this confidential letter, he rightly\r\nconsidered that for the complete exoneration of the Royal Irish\r\nhe should be permitted to make its contents known to the world;\r\nhe accordingly asked leave of Colonel Gough, Secretary to Lord\r\nWolseley, then Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, to publish it\r\nto the brigade of regular and militia battalions of the Royal Irish\r\nterritorial regiment, about to assemble at Kilworth under his orders.\r\nIn reply “as an exceptional case and in view of his proceeding to\r\nKilworth where other battalions of the regiment are stationed” he\r\nreceived an extract from a letter from the Adjutant-General to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, India, which runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that a perusal\r\nof the papers connected with the withdrawal of the 2nd battalion,\r\nRoyal Irish regiment from the field force on the North-West frontier\r\nhas satisfied the Commander-in-Chief that a grave injustice was done\r\nto the 2nd battalion, Royal Irish regiment when it was recalled from\r\nfield service.”\r\n\r\nColonel Lawrence immediately published this complete exoneration in\r\nan order to the troops at Kilworth (see appendix 5).\r\n\r\nIn order that the public should realise how completely the charges\r\nagainst the Royal Irish had been refuted, it was suggested that some\r\nsignal honour should be conferred upon the regiment. Her Majesty\r\nQueen Victoria, always remembering the XVIIIth when they guarded\r\nher at Windsor, had been much concerned at the libels on her Irish\r\nsoldiers; she at once appreciated the importance of proving to the\r\nworld that the rumours about the second battalion were absolutely\r\nwithout foundation, and by her command Lord Wolseley was appointed to\r\nbe the first Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Irish regiment. This mark\r\nof the Queen’s favour closed the Tirah incident, the most painful\r\nepisode in the long history of the regiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the second battalion was not one of the corps fortunate enough\r\nto be sent from India to South Africa for the Boer war, the record\r\nof its service during the remainder of the period embraced by this\r\nhistory is almost barren of interest. In February, 1900, the Royal\r\nIrish distinguished themselves at Mhow in putting out a dangerous\r\nfire, and were specially thanked by Major-General Nicholson, C.B.,\r\nwho commanded the district--\r\n\r\n  “The General Officer Commanding wishes to convey to the troops\r\n  in garrison, his thanks for the excellent work done by them\r\n  during the last few days in endeavouring to extinguish the recent\r\n  fire in the Commissariat stack-yard. The promptitude with which\r\n  Officers and men of the Royal Irish regiment turned out on the\r\n  first alarm undoubtedly saved the remainder of the stacks at\r\n  the time, and the zeal evinced and arduous work done by all the\r\n  troops in garrison on that and subsequent days has been fully\r\n  appreciated by the General Officer Commanding, and he will\r\n  have much pleasure in bringing the same to the notice of the\r\n  Lieutenant-General Commanding, Bombay Command.”\r\n\r\nA month later the battalion learned from Army Orders that to\r\ncommemorate the gallantry of the Irish regiments in the recent\r\nbattles in South Africa, the Queen had ordered that in future all\r\nranks of these corps should wear on St Patrick’s Day a sprig of\r\nshamrock in their head-dresses--a recognition of national sentiment\r\nwhich caused great satisfaction to both battalions of the XVIIIth,\r\nand to every other Irish regiment in Her Majesty’s army.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of Indian reliefs the second battalion was due\r\nto turn its face homewards in the autumn of 1900, but owing to the\r\nwar in South Africa all such arrangements were cancelled, and the\r\nRoyal Irish were ordered to remain at Mhow, where they were still\r\nquartered when in July, 1901, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Burton-Forster,\r\nrelinquishing the command on appointment to the Staff, was succeeded\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel H. S. Shuldham-Lye. The dislocation of reliefs\r\nwas not the only effect produced on the second battalion by the\r\nSouth African war. As every recruit, as soon as he was fit for\r\nactive service, was sent to join the first battalion, there was\r\ngreat danger that the second battalion would become dangerously weak\r\nif the time-expired men left India at the end of their engagement\r\nto serve with the Colours. As every battalion in India was in a\r\nsimilar plight the government offered liberal terms to men willing to\r\nre-engage, viz.--a bounty of £10 with a two months’ furlough at home,\r\nor an additional bounty of £16 in lieu of furlough to all ranks below\r\nthe rank of sergeant, who had completed six years and three months’\r\ncolonial service, and who had not entered upon the twelfth year of\r\nsuch service. The men who accepted these terms were to engage to\r\nextend their service so as to complete twelve years with the Colours.\r\nTwenty-two of the Royal Irish accepted the £10 bounty with furlough;\r\ntwo hundred and ninety-seven preferred to have £26 paid into their\r\nhands, and did not take a holiday at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDOW COMMEMORATIVE OF SOUTH AFRICAN WAR, 1899-1902.\r\n\r\nST PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL, DUBLIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1885-1900.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTALION.\r\n\r\nMOUNTED INFANTRY IN MASHONALAND: THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA: COLESBERG\r\nAND BETHLEHEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nearly four years after the return of the first battalion\r\nto England in 1885 it was quartered alternately at Plymouth and\r\nDevonport. During this time only three events of importance occurred\r\nin its history. In February, 1886, General Sir Richard Dennis Kelly,\r\nK.C.B.,[277] from the Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment (Royal\r\nCanadians), was appointed Colonel of the Royal Irish regiment, _vice_\r\nLieutenant-General and Honorary General Sir Alexander MacDonell,\r\nK.C.B., transferred to the Rifle Brigade. New Colours were presented\r\nto the battalion on September 7, 1886, at Devonport, by the Lady\r\nAlbertha Edgcumbe, daughter of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, at a\r\nceremony marked by a departure from precedent; hitherto the Colours\r\nof the Royal Irish had always been consecrated by a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England, but on this occasion the service was performed by\r\na Roman Catholic priest in recognition of the fact that the large\r\nmajority of the rank and file were members of the Church of Rome.\r\nIn the Gazette of March 9, 1889, Sir Richard Kelly was transferred\r\nto the command of the Border regiment, and was succeeded by\r\nLieutenant-General and Honorary General George Frederick Stephenson\r\nCall, C.B.[278] From Plymouth the battalion, six hundred and\r\nninety-nine of all ranks, under Lieutenant-Colonel A. J. A. Jackson,\r\nwas ordered in May, 1889, to Colchester, where it was inspected by\r\nits new Colonel, General Call, who after serving in the XVIIIth in\r\nChina, Burma, and the Crimea, had commanded it in India. While at\r\nColchester two serious misfortunes happened. In the autumn of 1889\r\nthe sergeants’ mess was burned down, and in it were lost several\r\ncups and trophies, and worse than all, the two engravings given by\r\nthe late King Edward VII. to the non-commissioned officers during\r\nhis visit to India while he was Prince of Wales. Nearly two years\r\nlater, on July 31, 1891, the officers’ mess hut met with a similar\r\nfate. A little past midnight, after the mess had been closed, an\r\nofficer discovered that the building was on fire. The alarm was at\r\nonce given; not only the Royal Irish, but the whole of the garrison\r\nturned out, but their united efforts, coupled with those of the town\r\nfire-brigade, failed to master the flames, and the hut and nearly all\r\nit contained was destroyed. There were several gallant but fruitless\r\nattempts to save the Colours; and it was only at great personal risk\r\nthat Private W. O’Neill succeeded in bringing away the silver model\r\nof a whale-boat, the trophy commemorating the battalion’s success in\r\nthe race up the Nile. Among the few things rescued was the snuff-box,\r\nwhich, as already mentioned on page 146, was the only piece of\r\nregimental plate saved from the wreck of the _Buckinghamshire_ in\r\n1851.\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn of 1891 the battalion was ordered to Ireland,\r\nand arrived at the Curragh in November under Lieutenant-Colonel J.\r\nD. Edge, whose marching-in state showed a strength of 697 officers\r\nand men. Next year, on November 14, new Colours were presented by\r\nLady Wolseley, to replace those lost in the fire at Colchester. At\r\nthe end of the ceremony Lord Wolseley addressed the Royal Irish, and\r\nafter reminding his audience that throughout his military career he\r\nhad been intimately associated with the regiment, he continued as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  “I served side by side with it in Burma when I was very young. I\r\n  met it again in the Crimea, and I can well remember what pride\r\n  I felt as an Irishman in its gallant conduct on the 18th June,\r\n  1855. It also served in India whilst I was there during the\r\n  Mutiny, and it must be in the remembrance of many of those who\r\n  are now on parade that we were comrades together during the war\r\n  in Egypt in 1882. I remember well, in the first streak of dawn\r\n  on the desert of Tel-el-Kebir, seeing the Royal Irish among the\r\n  first to cross the entrenchments, and again, two years later, we\r\n  met on the Nile, in which expedition they played a distinguished\r\n  part. I felt proud that they should have been the winners of a\r\n  prize which was offered to the battalion which made the journey\r\n  up the river in the shortest time. I have a very much prized\r\n  trophy of the expedition which was given me by one for whom I\r\n  have the greatest respect--one of the very best men and best\r\n  soldiers I ever knew--I refer to Father Brindle, your former\r\n  chaplain, who accompanied you from Cairo up the river, and then\r\n  across the Desert to Gubat. The trophy is the flag of the boat in\r\n  which he made the voyage up the Nile; it is marked ‘H Company,\r\n  Royal Irish.’ Yours is one of the oldest regiments in the army.\r\n  When first raised it was named ‘The regiment of Ireland.’ That\r\n  name was changed by William III. to the Royal Irish regiment,\r\n  as a reward, a distinction for your gallant services at the\r\n  taking of Namur. If I were to enter into detailed history of the\r\n  regiment it would be to give a history of the British army, for\r\n  the history of one may be said to be the history of the other. I\r\n  chanced to read an old book the other day, describing the wars\r\n  of the early part of the last century, in which it was stated\r\n  that the discipline, system of drill, and fighting, training of\r\n  the army then had been copied from the discipline and military\r\n  system long established in the Royal Irish regiment. As you know\r\n  from the names of the battles on your Colours you shared in all\r\n  the glories of the Duke of Marlborough, and although hereafter I\r\n  have no doubt you will add many names to these Colours--for we\r\n  shall have wars as long as the world lasts--no greater victory\r\n  than that of Blenheim or Ramillies can ever be shared in by any\r\n  regiment. Now, what is the value of all this glory to a regiment,\r\n  or to the army of which it is a part? It is this, it intensifies\r\n  the pride of the regiment, and the pride of that Empire to\r\n  which we all belong; it is an incentive to those who come after\r\n  us to imitate, and, if possible, to excel the deeds of their\r\n  forefathers. May God bless these Colours and prosper this fine\r\n  old distinguished regiment.”\r\n\r\nAfter three years at the Curragh the battalion was ordered to\r\nLimerick, where it arrived early in November, 1894. The Royal Irish\r\nhad hardly settled down in their new quarters when they lost their\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, J. D. Edge, who died in Dublin on the 15th of\r\nDecember, and less than a month later General Call followed him to\r\nthe grave. Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. A. Spyer succeeded to the command\r\nof the battalion: General Call was replaced by Lieutenant-General\r\nand Honorary General R. W. M‘L. Fraser, on whose transfer to the\r\nRoyal Warwickshire regiment less than a year later, Major-General and\r\nHonorary Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, V.C., a former\r\nofficer of the XVIIIth, was appointed to fill the vacancy on November\r\n22, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1896 news reached England of a dangerous native\r\nrising in Rhodesia, a huge territory lately added to the possessions\r\nof Britain, and bounded to the north by the Zambesi river, to the\r\neast by Portuguese East Africa, and to the south by the Transvaal.\r\nThe distances in the theatre of war were so enormous, and the\r\nmobility of the enemy so great, that the War Office determined\r\nto reinforce the troops in South Africa with foot soldiers who\r\ncould ride, and the battalions at home were called upon to furnish\r\ndetachments of officers and men who had been trained to act as\r\nmounted infantry. Lieutenant S. G. French was selected to command the\r\ncontingent from the Royal Irish, and with thirty non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men, formed part of a composite unit known as the Irish\r\nCompany, mounted infantry. They embarked on May 2, 1896; landed at\r\nCape Town, and after remaining some time encamped at Wynberg, sailed\r\nto Beira, the harbour in Portuguese territory from which Rhodesia\r\ncould be approached most easily by sea. Thanks to the courtesy of\r\nthe Government at Lisbon, our troops were allowed to make use of\r\nthe port, and to pass through the belt of coast land between the\r\nocean and the frontier of Rhodesia. Once arrived at Salisbury, the\r\nprincipal British settlement in our new territory, the handful of\r\nRoyal Irish were allotted to a column under Lieutenant-Colonel E.\r\nA. H. Alderson, and were employed in pacifying northern Mashonaland.\r\nThis is not the place to describe the expedition: it is enough to say\r\nthat the representatives of the regiment did well on every occasion\r\nwhen they were engaged.[279] In Colonel Alderson’s report of November\r\n25, 1897, he stated that “the detachment under Lieutenant French\r\ndid their work excellently in every way, especially when on active\r\nservice in Mashonaland. After the action at Makia’s Kraal on August\r\n30, 1896, I had much pleasure in reporting them to Sir Frederick\r\nCarrington, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., commanding the forces in Rhodesia,\r\nas follows: ‘I should like to mention the ready way in which the\r\nRoyal Irish section of the Irish Company, Mounted Infantry, followed\r\nLieutenant French across a considerable piece of open ground under a\r\nbrisk fire.’” When Lieutenant French and his detachment returned to\r\nEngland they rejoined headquarters where the medal, issued to all who\r\ntook part in the campaign, was presented to them in due course.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish were so popular in Limerick that, when it became\r\nknown that the first battalion was to move to Dublin in the autumn,\r\nthe townspeople petitioned the Government to allow it to remain for\r\nanother year. When the request was granted the Corporation took the\r\nopportunity of presenting the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nSpyer, with a very complimentary address, containing many references\r\nto the uniformly good conduct of the regiment, and to the high\r\nesteem with which it was regarded by all creeds and classes of the\r\npopulation. The Royal Irish were still quartered in Limerick at\r\nthe time of the Jubilee celebrating the completion of the sixtieth\r\nyear of Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s reign. Certain disloyalists\r\nattempted to mar the rejoicings by hoisting a black flag upon one of\r\nthe islands of the Shannon; the local authorities were most anxious\r\nto remove this emblem of treason, but the owners of the river boats,\r\nintimidated by the rabble, refused the large sum of money offered for\r\nthe use of their craft, and there appeared no means of reaching the\r\nobnoxious flag, when Private ---- Cullen, Royal Irish regiment, came\r\nto the rescue, and, to quote from the account of his gallant feat\r\nwhich appeared in the London ‘Globe’ of July 5, 1897,\r\n\r\n  “lowering himself by a rope from the barracks, which overhang\r\n  the river, he plunged in, and struck out for the rock. Crowds\r\n  congregated on the opposite bank, and some at least--for there\r\n  are many in Limerick too loyal and too sensible to be the\r\n  playthings of vindictive agitators--watched his progress through\r\n  the fierce current in mental trepidation. He reached the rock,\r\n  tore up the pole and flag, and not daring to return in the teeth\r\n  of the stream, swam with his capture to the bank. It was only\r\n  after a long and hard struggle that he was able to make land,\r\n  where a strong body of police met and escorted him back to\r\n  barracks. Had it not been for the police, serious if not fatal\r\n  injuries would have been done him, as a great crowd of women were\r\n  prepared to stone him as he approached.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1897, the Royal Irish regiment heard with deep regret\r\nof the death of their Colonel, Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, V.C., who,\r\nwhile in India to disprove the charges brought against the second\r\nbattalion, was killed in the Khyber Pass on December 31, 1897. He\r\nwas succeeded by Major-General C. F. Gregorie, C.B.,[280] who had\r\ncommanded the second battalion at Tel-el-Kebir. In the summer of\r\n1898, as has been already mentioned, Her Majesty Queen Victoria paid\r\nthe regiment the very high honour of directing that Field-Marshal the\r\nRight Honourable Garnet, Viscount Wolseley, K.P., G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,\r\nColonel Royal Horse Guards, Commander-in-Chief, should be appointed\r\nColonel-in-Chief of the Royal Irish regiment.[281]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1898, the first battalion moved to Buttevant with many\r\nregrets, for officers and men alike had found Limerick an ideal\r\nstation. The racing was good, the hunting excellent,[282] the\r\ninhabitants were hospitable and thoroughly appreciated the good\r\nqualities of the Royal Irish, whom they had grown to look upon as\r\npersonal friends. In the autumn of 1898, the bronze medal of the\r\nRoyal Humane Society was presented to Lieutenant E. M. Panter-Downes\r\nby Colonel W. W. Lawrence, commanding the XVIIIth regimental\r\ndistrict; the circumstances in which this decoration was won are\r\nset out in the following extract from Colonel Lawrence’s speech on\r\nparade, when he pinned the medal on to the recipient’s breast:--\r\n\r\n  “I have a very pleasing duty to perform this morning, and that is\r\n  to present to Mr Panter-Downes, of the 1st battalion, the Royal\r\n  Humane Society’s medal for risking his life to save that of a\r\n  gentleman at Kilkee, Co. Clare, in August last. Captain Vigors\r\n  and Mr Panter-Downes went to bathe that morning. There was a very\r\n  heavy sea running, and the waves were breaking over the rocks.\r\n  They noticed a man’s clothes on the cliff, but saw nothing of him\r\n  at the time. Shortly after they saw him in the water, in a very\r\n  exhausted condition, almost at the last gasp. Mr Panter-Downes at\r\n  once jumped in and swam thirty or forty yards through the surf\r\n  to the drowning man. He secured him, and with him swam back to\r\n  the iron ladder used by bathers, where Captain Vigors met him,\r\n  and between the two of them they got the man in safely. When they\r\n  were on the ladder the waves were washing over them, and they\r\n  were in danger of being carried away.”\r\n\r\nOn Colonel W. W. Lawrence’s retirement from the service he was\r\nsucceeded in command of the 18th regimental district by Colonel\r\nJ. H. A. Spyer, who was promoted Colonel on the 16th of January,\r\n1899. In the same Gazette Major H. W. N. Guinness was promoted\r\nto be Lieutenant-Colonel. The autumn of 1899 found the battalion\r\nstill quartered in Ireland, with the eyes of all ranks turned upon\r\nSouth Africa, where the course of political events showed with\r\never-increasing clearness that the South African republics were\r\ndetermined to force a war upon Great Britain. The causes of the\r\nquarrel are too complex to be discussed in a regimental history;\r\nfrom the soldier’s point of view the all-important question was\r\nwhether England was to continue the paramount power in South Africa\r\nor to be ousted by the Dutch republics, and the earnest hope of\r\nevery man in the regiment was that the XVIIIth would be allowed to\r\ntake part in the struggle in which this great question was to be\r\ndecided. For a time this hope seemed destined not to be fulfilled,\r\nfor though Captain S. E. St Leger was appointed to command a company\r\nof mounted infantry, of which a section was provided by the Royal\r\nIrish,[283] the first battalion was not among the troops selected\r\nfor the “Expeditionary Force” despatched to the seat of war in\r\nOctober and November. The officers made every effort to induce the\r\nWar Office to send the battalion to South Africa, but failed to\r\nobtain anything more definite than a promise that if more troops were\r\nrequired, every attention would be paid to the desire of the Royal\r\nIrish to be actively employed. When it was decided to strengthen the\r\nexpeditionary force with another division, the 5th, the battalion\r\nhoped to find a place in one of its brigades, but it was not included\r\nin General Warren’s command, and until the beginning of December\r\nthere seemed no prospect that it would take part in the Boer war.\r\nThe Royal Irish were then at Aldershot, where they had arrived on\r\nNovember 24, to join the second battalions of the Bedfordshire,\r\nWorcestershire, and Wiltshire regiments in the 12th infantry brigade,\r\ncommanded by Colonel, afterwards Major-General R. A. P. Clements.\r\nThey had not yet thoroughly settled down in their new quarters when\r\nthey were roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the news that\r\nthe 12th brigade was to mobilise forthwith, and to start in a few\r\ndays for South Africa as part of Lieutenant-General Kelly-Kenny’s\r\nnewly formed division, the 6th. Then began a rush so tremendous\r\nthat those who went through it now look back on the time between\r\nthe 2nd of December, when the orders were received, and the 16th,\r\nwhen the battalion sailed, as a nightmare; there was an enormous\r\namount of work to be done; the days were very short; the barracks\r\nwere badly lighted; everyone was at fever heat with excitement;\r\nand the strain upon the officers and non-commissioned officers\r\nwas quite indescribable. All men over twenty years of age had to\r\nbe medically examined to see if they were fit for active service;\r\nclothing and equipment for the field had to be drawn and fitted, and\r\narrangements made for the well-being of the women and children of the\r\nbattalion, whether “on” or “off” the strength; the reserve men had\r\nto be brought over from Clonmel, armed, clothed, and fitted out in\r\nevery way.[284] Lectures on the value of inoculation against enteric\r\nwere given to induce men to submit themselves voluntarily to the\r\noperation; soldiers whose marksmanship was below the average received\r\nadditional instruction in musketry, and preparations were made for\r\nthe disposal of those men who were too young or not physically fit\r\nfor the campaign. In the midst of all this bustle, three officers and\r\nsixty-seven of the other ranks were sent off to the mounted infantry\r\nat Shorncliffe,[285] and the reservists--three sergeants, seven\r\ncorporals, and two hundred and seventy privates--arrived, who, from\r\ntheir age, their long service, and the experience which many of them\r\nhad gained on the north-west frontier of India, proved invaluable in\r\nthe South African war.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish, who shared the s.s. _Gascon_ with the Wiltshire\r\nregiment, embarked at Southampton with thirteen officers, one warrant\r\nofficer, and 672 non-commissioned officers and men, or a total of\r\n686 of all ranks, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W. H.\r\nN. Guinness.[286] To understand why so small a number of officers\r\nstarted with headquarters for South Africa, the reader must remember\r\nthat before the battalion left Ireland it had furnished a draft of\r\nmen trained to mounted infantry work, who were accompanied by three\r\nofficers; during the weary weeks when it seemed probable that the\r\nRoyal Irish would remain at home as part of the garrison of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, several officers had obtained staff appointments in\r\nSouth Africa, or had been attached to regiments already at the seat\r\nof war, and, as has been already mentioned, three more joined the\r\nmounted infantry while the battalion was at Aldershot.\r\n\r\nThe XVIIIth sailed from England under all the depressing influences\r\nof the “Black Week”--the disastrous seven days in which three\r\nconsiderable bodies of British troops sustained severe reverses at\r\nthe hands of the Boers. General Sir Redvers Buller, then in supreme\r\ncommand in South Africa, had been defeated at Colenso in his attempt\r\nto extricate the defenders of Ladysmith from the grip of the burghers\r\nwhose commandos hemmed them in on every side. Lieutenant-General\r\nGatacre had been heavily repulsed at Stormberg in his attack upon\r\none of the columns that had invaded the north-east of Cape Colony.\r\nLieutenant-General Lord Methuen, after three successes in his march\r\nfrom the Orange river towards Kimberley, had failed with heavy loss\r\nto dislodge Cronje from the kopjes of Magersfontein. But though the\r\ncountry was profoundly depressed at the news of these successive\r\ndefeats, the spirits of the Royal Irish were as high as ever, and\r\neven had their buoyant temperaments been influenced by the national\r\ngloom at the time of their departure, life on board the _Gascon_\r\nwas too full of occupation to allow time for thinking of unpleasant\r\nthings. As the reservists had not joined in time to be equipped\r\nfully before they left Aldershot, their field service kit was issued\r\nto them on the voyage; and as many of them had not been trained to\r\nthe use of the Lee-Metford rifle, they were put through a course of\r\nmusketry at sea. All hands were daily exercised in physical drill;\r\nammunition carriers and company scouts were selected and given\r\ntheoretical instruction in their duties; identity cards were prepared\r\nand sewn into the men’s clothing, and wire cutters served out. To\r\nprovide healthy amusement for the troops the officers organised\r\n“tugs-of-war” and other forms of athletics in the afternoons, while\r\nconcerts and “sing-songs” filled up the evening hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the _Gascon_ reached Cape Town on the 6th of January, 1900, the\r\nRoyal Irish and the Wiltshire were ordered not to disembark, as the\r\ndestination of Clements’ brigade was still uncertain. For three days\r\nthe battalion remained inactive, with little to do but to gaze on the\r\nlovely scenery of Table Bay; to admire the great fleet of transports\r\nand store-ships floating on its waters, and to form some idea of the\r\ngeneral situation at the front. This was no easy matter, for the\r\ncensorship over the South African press was severe, and the papers\r\nin Cape Town gave much less news of the war than those published\r\nin the United Kingdom. Gradually the Royal Irish ascertained that\r\nthe Boer leaders had not known how to profit by their victories.\r\nThe state of affairs had not altered materially since the _Gascon_\r\nleft England, and the Union Jack still waved over the three towns to\r\nwhich the burghers were laying siege. The reports from Mafeking were\r\nsatisfactory, and showed a spirit of hopeful resolution, contrasting\r\nfavourably with the attitude of part of the civilian population of\r\nKimberley. This great mining centre was held by a force of improvised\r\nvolunteers, stiffened by half a battalion of regular infantry and\r\na few gunners. Its townspeople had been greatly discouraged by\r\nMethuen’s defeat at Magersfontein; they were now beginning to feel\r\nthe privations of the siege, or rather of the investment, for in\r\nthe true sense of the word Kimberley was not besieged; and every\r\nnative runner who made his way through the enemy’s lines brought\r\nurgent appeals for immediate relief, not only from politicians and\r\nmerchants, but also from Mr Rhodes, whose influence at the diamond\r\nfields was so commanding that he was virtually dictator of Kimberley.\r\nIn Natal the garrison of Ladysmith had just repulsed a vigorous\r\nassault upon their southern defences; but supplies were beginning to\r\nrun short, enteric and dysentery were rampant, and privations and\r\noverwork were beginning to tell heavily upon the _physique_ of Sir\r\nGeorge White’s troops, whose _morale_, however, hardship and fatigue\r\nhad in no wise impaired. In the field the enemy had made no more\r\nprogress than in his siege operations. No Boer commando had crossed\r\nthe Tugela to harass Sir Redvers Buller as he lay echeloned along the\r\nrailway from Chieveley to the coast, and thus he had been unmolested\r\nwhile preparing for his second attempt to relieve Ladysmith--the\r\neffort which beginning on the 10th of January, 1900, ended in failure\r\ntwenty-eight days later at Vaal Kranz. In Cape Colony the Boers\r\nhad been as slothful as in Natal. Gatacre’s opponents were still\r\nconcentrated round Stormberg; the commandos which had raided across\r\nthe Orange river by the Norval’s Pont bridge were so stoutly opposed\r\nby Lieutenant-General French that they could advance no farther than\r\nColesberg: Cronje, who since his victory on December 11, 1899, had\r\nremained inactive at Magersfontein, was confronted by Methuen’s\r\nentrenchments at the junction of the Riet and Modder rivers, and the\r\nrailway between Methuen’s camp to the bridge over the Orange river\r\nwas adequately guarded. Thus the invaders had not gained ground,\r\nand as even the most disaffected of the Cape Dutch had no intention\r\nof breaking into open rebellion until commandos of Transvaalers or\r\nFree Staters appeared among them, no general rising throughout the\r\ncolony had taken place; and the safety of the railways running from\r\nthe coast to our various advanced posts was not seriously imperilled,\r\nthough the protection of those lines of communication immobilised a\r\nlarge number of troops.\r\n\r\nFour days after the _Gascon_ steamed into Table Bay, Field-Marshal\r\nLord Roberts arrived at Cape Town to take command of the army in\r\nSouth Africa. For political reasons the disembarkation of the\r\nheadquarter staff was made the occasion for a military display;\r\ntroops lined the streets, and a company of the Royal Irish was sent\r\non shore to form a guard of honour at the landing-stage. A few hours\r\nlater the _Gascon_ sailed for Port Elizabeth, where on January 12,\r\n1900, the battalion landed, and was ordered to a camp three miles\r\nfrom the harbour. It was so long since the XVIIIth had been on\r\nactive service that among the rank and file only the reservists,\r\nand indeed not all of them, knew how varied and how arduous are\r\nthe fatigue duties which troops are called upon to perform in a\r\ncampaign, and the first day’s work in South Africa proved very trying\r\nto men just out from England: in burning heat they had first to\r\ntake their part in unloading the ship, then to pack the stores and\r\nbaggage on a train which stopped a mile short of their destination;\r\nnext to “off-load” the goods, and finally to carry them by hand\r\ninto the camp and there arrange them in proper order. Before many\r\nweeks were over the young soldiers, partly by experience and partly\r\nby the teaching of their older comrades, had learned that in war\r\nfor every day spent in fighting fifty are occupied in marching, in\r\nmaking entrenchments or breast-works, in mending roads, in building\r\nbridges, in digging waggons out of deep mud-holes, and in dragging\r\nguns up the sides of precipitous mountains. Early on the 13th, the\r\nbattalion was ordered up country to reinforce General French, who\r\nwith a column of all arms was defending the western portion of the\r\nDe Aar-Naauwpoort-Stormberg railway which, running roughly parallel\r\nwith the Orange river, links together the various lines from the\r\ncoast to the interior of the sub-continent. The eastern part of\r\nthis cross-country railway was in the hands of the enemy, and one\r\nof the most important points left to us was Naauwpoort junction,\r\nonly thirty-three miles south of Colesberg, the little town where\r\nSchoeman, the leader of the invaders, had taken up his quarters. He\r\nhad intended to drive the British garrison out of Naauwpoort, break\r\nup the line connecting Cape Town with Kimberley, and then raise the\r\nstandard of revolt in the central provinces of Cape Colony; but by\r\na series of brilliant and audacious manœuvres French had gradually\r\nedged him back into the network of kopjes encircling Colesberg. Now,\r\nin the middle of January, our infantry watched the southern and\r\nwestern faces of this natural fortress, while our mounted troops,\r\nwidely thrust out on either flank, sought opportunities to harass\r\nSchoeman’s communications with the Orange Free State. The railway\r\nfrom Port Elizabeth to Bloemfontein, the capital of the Free State,\r\nhad been recovered to within ten miles of Colesberg; and railhead was\r\nat Rensberg siding, where the battalion arrived on the 15th after a\r\njourney full of novel experiences. Owing to want of rolling stock\r\nthe soldiers were conveyed, not in ordinary passenger carriages,\r\nbut in open goods trucks. If a company was lucky it travelled in\r\nempty trucks, but if there were no “empties” available, the men had\r\nto perch on the top of loads of coal or stores, and to cling on for\r\ndear life as the train swayed violently in rounding sharp turnings\r\nin the line. Every bridge and every important culvert was held by\r\ndetachments of local volunteers, who as the train approached their\r\npost emerged from their improvised shelters to beg for newspapers,\r\nand to report that all was well. Every station was guarded by\r\nirregular troops, and on the platforms were loyalist ladies, who\r\nenthusiastically greeted the Royal Irish, pressing fruit, flowers,\r\nand tobacco upon them, and begging for regimental buttons or badges\r\nas mementos of the meeting. At every siding stood long trains,\r\nshunted to give passage to the troops--some composed of “empties”\r\ngoing back to the base to refill, others laden with supplies of every\r\nkind for the front. At long intervals there were halts at stations to\r\ngive the men time to eat the meals, for which preparations had been\r\nmade in advance by the Railway staff officers in charge of the line;\r\nand as the troop-train gradually neared railhead it passed several\r\nvillages where French had met and beaten back the enemy while the\r\nbattalion was still upon the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Irish reached Rensberg they heard that they were to\r\nreinforce the extreme right of French’s main line, then resting\r\non Slingersfontein, a farm ten miles south-east of Colesberg. The\r\nburghers, discovering that this post was weakly manned, were becoming\r\naggressive; and only a few hours before, a detachment of New Zealand\r\nMounted Rifles under Captain Madock, R.A., with a handful of the\r\nYorkshire regiment, had found very great difficulty in beating back\r\na determined attack upon two hills, which, rising about four hundred\r\nfeet above the plain between Slingersfontein and the Boer positions\r\nround Colesberg, were held as outworks to the farm. General Clements\r\nwas placed in command of the Slingersfontein area, and when on the\r\n16th the battalion, now provided with transport waggons and mules,\r\narrived at his headquarters, he ordered Colonel Guinness to occupy\r\nthese kopjes as permanent detached posts. Three companies marched off\r\nto “Madock’s” and “New Zealand hills,” as the scenes of the previous\r\nday’s fighting were now called; the rest of the Royal Irish went on\r\npicket; and though the strain of work slightly diminished as the\r\nremainder of the 12th brigade successively joined its headquarters,\r\nfor the next few weeks the battalion was on outpost for two nights\r\nout of three. As soon as Slingersfontein was fairly safe, French used\r\nit as a pivot for the mounted troops with whom he was trying to find\r\nand turn the enemy’s left flank, but as to the east and south-east\r\nof Colesberg he was checked by commandos in superior and apparently\r\never-increasing strength, he sought at the other end of his line for\r\nopportunities to manœuvre the enemy still farther backwards towards\r\nthe Orange river. Before he was able to profit by the information\r\ngained in his reconnaissances to the north of the village, he was\r\nsummoned to Cape Town by Lord Roberts, who desired to explain to him\r\npersonally the part allotted to the cavalry division in the plan of\r\ncampaign, elaborated by the Commander-in-Chief and three or four of\r\nhis most trusted advisers since their arrival in South Africa. In a\r\nregimental history it would be out of place to describe how the main\r\narmy was assembled within striking distance of the western frontier\r\nof the Orange Free State: it is enough to say that, thanks to the\r\nabsolute secrecy maintained by the few officers who were in Lord\r\nRoberts’ confidence, the long and difficult process was effected with\r\nremarkable success. The troops were entrained without an idea where\r\nthey were going; the military railway officials despatched the trains\r\nin obedience to orders they did not understand; contradictory and\r\nmisleading reports were spread broadcast over the colony in order to\r\ndeceive the enemy’s spies and sympathisers. This policy produced the\r\ndesired result. The burghers, completely puzzled by the information\r\nthat reached them, failed to penetrate the object of Lord Roberts’\r\nmovements, and beyond reinforcing the commandos at Colesberg, made no\r\nimportant changes in their dispositions.\r\n\r\nAs the cavalry division was now required to cover the concentration\r\nof the main army, French returned to Rensberg to superintend its\r\ntransfer to the Orange-River-Kimberley line; and on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, after seeing the last of his own troops quietly disappear\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Colesberg, he made over the command of the\r\ndistrict to Clements, whom Lord Roberts had appointed to continue the\r\nwork hitherto performed by the cavalry commander. The duty entrusted\r\nto Clements was no easy one. The detachment left with him was weak\r\nin numbers, weaker still in mobility; it consisted of two squadrons\r\nof regular cavalry; about 650 Australian volunteers, many of whom\r\nhad arrived in South Africa as foot soldiers; 450 regular infantry,\r\nof whom a considerable proportion were by no means good riders; one\r\nbattery of Horse, one of Field artillery, and two howitzers; the\r\n12th brigade of infantry and half a battalion of the Royal Berkshire\r\nregiment. With this small force he had to maintain himself on a\r\nfront twenty-five miles in length against a foe whose numbers were\r\nnow estimated to be between 11,000 and 12,000 men, well armed and\r\nmounted, and whose artillery, a 40-pr., five field-guns, and five\r\npom-poms, was by no means to be despised. Clements carried on the\r\nsystem of defence devised by French. Companies or larger detachments\r\nof infantry were posted on important points, a mile or more apart,\r\nin rough forts built of the stones and boulders with which the hills\r\nwere strewn. Every opportunity was taken to make these works more\r\nsecure, and as the Royal Irish plied pick and shovel and crowbar to\r\nimprove their defences, careful observation was kept on the enemy’s\r\nbig gun, and whenever the 40-pr. was turned in their direction a\r\nsignal warned them to take cover instantly. Thanks to the vigilance\r\nof their look-out men, the Royal Irish, though frequently shelled,\r\nwere able always “to go to earth” in time, and suffered no losses\r\nfrom the cannonade. The front and flanks of the positions were\r\nwatched by groups of sentries, concealed from the enemy’s view and\r\nfire by sangars--the dry-stone breastworks, of which constant use was\r\nmade throughout the war. Very soon after French’s troops had been\r\nwithdrawn, the burghers discovered that the British facing them had\r\nperceptibly diminished in strength, and at once began a series of\r\nattempts to turn Clements’ flanks and cut off his communications with\r\nthe rest of the army. Between the 6th and the 11th there was fighting\r\non various parts of the line, and so many shells fell among the tents\r\nof the Royal Irish and the Worcester that the camps were removed to\r\nless exposed positions.[287] On the 12th, both flanks were severely\r\nbombarded and then attacked by riflemen, who succeeded in ousting the\r\ndefenders of Hobkirk’s farm, the post marking our extreme left. At\r\nthe other end of the line the half battalion of the Worcestershire,\r\nwhich was holding a group of kopjes to the east of Slingersfontein,\r\nwas hotly shelled, and then exposed to a rifle-fire so heavy that\r\nafter considerable loss it was unable to retain the whole of the\r\nground entrusted to it, though the greater part was stubbornly and\r\nsuccessfully defended till nightfall.\r\n\r\nClements had been obliged to throw every available man into his\r\nfighting line, and thus, when his left was turned and his right in\r\nserious danger, he had no reserves in hand with which to recapture\r\nthe lost positions. He decided therefore to retire, and while the\r\ntroops on the flanks were still able to hold the Boers in some degree\r\nin check, he made his preparations to fall back on Rensberg. From\r\ndetails which have been preserved of the way in which the troops\r\nwere withdrawn from the right of the line, we learn that each of the\r\ndetachments, scattered over the many miles of country comprised in\r\nthe Slingersfontein area, received orders to leave its post at an\r\nhour timed to bring it into camp thirty minutes before the column\r\nwas to march. At about 8 P.M., after all the Kaffirs employed as\r\nbullock-drivers had been “rounded up and placed under guard to\r\nprevent their bolting,” the oxen were inspanned with as little noise\r\nas possible, and as each waggon was ready it was sent off to the\r\nunit to which it was allotted. The tents were then struck, each\r\ncorps leaving a few standing to deceive the enemy, and finally the\r\ntelegraph and signalling stations were dismantled and packed up.[288]\r\nWhile the carts and waggons were returning to the rendezvous of\r\nthe baggage, a company of the Royal Irish was sent to reinforce a\r\ndetachment of the battalion in guarding a defile through which the\r\ncolumn was about to retire, and when the troops were assembled the\r\nmarch began. Part of the XVIIIth, preceded by a few mounted scouts,\r\nformed the advance-guard; then came two guns of the Royal Horse\r\nartillery, followed by the whole of the transport vehicles and the\r\nremainder of the guns, under escort of dismounted troops. The convoy\r\nwas flanked by infantry, with supports distributed at intervals\r\nthroughout its length. The rear-guard was composed of the rest of\r\nthe foot soldiers in column of half companies at column distance,\r\nfollowed by a company in extended order, and covered by the whole of\r\nthe mounted troops, widely extended. Thanks to the brilliancy of the\r\nmoonlight and to the fact that the burghers made no attempt to harass\r\nthe retreat, Clements arrived early on the 13th at Rensberg, where to\r\nhis annoyance he found that the Boers had anticipated his movements\r\nby occupying a range of kopjes, which from the east commanded the\r\nrailway from Rensberg to Arundel, the next station southward on the\r\nline towards Naauwpoort Junction. As the presence of the enemy among\r\nthese kopjes made it impossible for him to remain at Rensberg, the\r\nGeneral determined to fall back on Arundel, which he reached at 5\r\nA.M. on the 14th of February.\r\n\r\nHere for a few days he stood on the defensive, his infantry holding\r\npositions on the hills, his mounted men demonstrating vigorously on\r\neither flank. During this time the _rôle_ of the Royal Irish was much\r\nthe same as that assigned to them at Slingersfontein: four companies\r\nheld a large kopje to the left rear of the village, and the remainder\r\nof the battalion was constantly employed on outpost and on fatigues\r\nof every kind. The enemy was by no means inactive, and on the 20th\r\nattacked Clements in front and on both flanks, but without success;\r\nand the good fortune which had attended the XVIIIth throughout the\r\noperations at Colesberg continued at Arundel, for though at both\r\nplaces it was frequently shelled and often exposed to the fire of\r\nlong-range snipers, no casualties occurred while it was serving south\r\nof the Orange river. In a short time Clements was reinforced by two\r\nfield-batteries, two 5-in. guns, a battalion of British militia,\r\nand a considerable number of mounted volunteers, chiefly from Cape\r\nColony and Australia; and after driving away the detachment of the\r\nenemy which was threatening his left rear, he gradually recovered\r\nthe ground he had abandoned, shelling the Boers out of successive\r\npositions, the flanks of which he threatened with his mounted troops.\r\nAt that moment it was not part of the Commander-in-Chief’s plan to\r\nstrike hard for the Norval’s Pont bridge, so Clements’ movements\r\nwere comparatively slow, but on the 28th of February he re-occupied\r\nColesberg without opposition, for as the Boers had heard of Cronje’s\r\nsurrender at Paardeberg,[289] they were now falling back on the\r\nOrange river, doing as much damage as possible to the railway in\r\ntheir retreat. Clements followed them, repairing the line as he\r\nadvanced; and on the 8th of March the head of his column stood on the\r\nleft bank of the river, facing a considerable number of burghers,\r\nwho from the other side of the stream exulted in the destruction\r\nof the Norval’s Pont bridge, the three central spans of which they\r\nhad blown up. It was impossible to attempt to force the passage of\r\nthe Orange, as floods rendered it impassable for several days; the\r\npontoon troop did not arrive as soon as it was expected; when it did\r\ncome up several of the pontoons proved unserviceable, and it was\r\nnot until the 15th that the river was bridged by a structure, 260\r\nyards in length, supported partly on pontoons and partly on piers\r\nextemporised from casks. Large numbers of the labourers employed in\r\nits construction were supplied from the ranks of the Royal Irish. As\r\nsoon as the bridge was practicable, a considerable body of troops\r\ncrossed at once and established themselves unmolested on the soil of\r\nthe Free State.\r\n\r\nTo those who judge of the importance of a military operation by\r\nthe length of the casualty lists, the work done by the Royal Irish\r\nand the other units of the 12th brigade since they landed in South\r\nAfrica will appear insignificant, as between the 6th of February and\r\nthe 15th of March the total losses in Clements’ whole command only\r\namounted to 327 killed, wounded, and missing. Soldiers, however,\r\nwill appreciate the value of the part played in this stage of the\r\ncampaign by General Clements, who, in the words of the official\r\nhistorian, “had to detain the Boers at Colesberg and prevent them\r\nfrom swooping upon the lines of communication south of the Orange--a\r\nmovement which, if successful, would have caused an outbreak of\r\nactive disloyalty in large districts of Cape Colony hitherto sullenly\r\nquiescent. By maintaining himself between Rensberg and Arundel he\r\nfulfilled his chief function, as well as the hardly less important\r\nduties of guarding the right rear of the main army, of securing\r\nthe safety of the important railway junction of Naauwpoort, and\r\nincidentally of keeping under his fire a body of the enemy who might\r\notherwise have joined in the opposition to Lord Roberts’ march.”[290]\r\n\r\nThe history of the battalion for the next two months is almost\r\ndevoid of interest. The Royal Irish formed part of the column which\r\nClements led from the Orange river to Bloemfontein, over a vast and\r\ngently undulating plain, dotted at rare intervals with villages whose\r\ninhabitants, professing to be tired of the war, readily handed over\r\nto the troops a few hundred rifles, some of modern pattern, others\r\nso obsolete as to be fit for nothing but a museum of antiquities. On\r\nthe 4th of April, the 12th brigade reached the capital of the Free\r\nState, where it remained stationary for several weeks, fully, though\r\nby no means agreeably, occupied in the drudgery which fell to the\r\nlot of every soldier fated to garrison any of the towns wrested from\r\nthe enemy. There was much wood cutting: many fatigues at the railway\r\nstation: heavy guards and outposts, and frequent route marches.\r\nFor men whose drill was not perfect there were parades; and when\r\ndrafts began to arrive from home, courses of musketry and judging\r\ndistance were carried out for the benefit of the new-comers. The use\r\nof the rifle was not the only part of a soldier’s trade in which\r\nthe youngsters required training. As they were ignorant of the art\r\nof making themselves comfortable on active service their comrades,\r\nwho had learned much since they landed at Port Elizabeth, took this\r\nbranch of their education in hand, and taught the recruits to live\r\ntogether in groups of three men, dividing the work among them: one\r\ncollected fuel--_e.g._, cow-dung or scraps of wood; the second looked\r\nafter the fire and cooked; while the third pitched the bivouac and\r\nacted as orderly man to the little mess.\r\n\r\nIn May the battalion was in great strength, for although exposure,\r\nhardships, and enteric fever had begun to take toll, the drafts\r\nhad more than made good the waste of the campaign. The deficiency\r\nof officers was a thing of the past, for many had found their way\r\nout to South Africa within two or three weeks of the landing of\r\nthe battalion at Port Elizabeth, and others had brought out drafts\r\nfrom home. In March six officers and a hundred and ninety-six other\r\nranks joined near Arundel; in April two officers and ninety six men\r\n(chiefly from the militia reserve) reached Bloemfontein; and on May\r\n8, two large parties reported themselves to Colonel Guinness: the\r\nfirst consisted of two officers and ninety-six men from the depôt;\r\nthe second was a company of volunteers--three officers and a hundred\r\nand nine other ranks from the 5th (Irish) battalion of the King’s\r\n(Liverpool regiment). In no war ever waged by Britain has the stream\r\nof reinforcements been so abundant, so evenly distributed, and so\r\nwell maintained as in the long struggle with the Boer republics. The\r\nRoyal Irish were not more favoured than other corps, yet from the\r\ntime the battalion landed until peace was declared no less than 1180\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men joined headquarters. The second\r\nbattalion provided 150 seasoned men from India, and eight drafts, 443\r\nin all, were sent out from home by the officer commanding details:\r\nthe militia battalions of the Royal Irish territorial regiment\r\ncontributed 423 (exclusive of three officers),[291] and the Irish\r\nvolunteers in Liverpool furnished a contingent of 164 (also exclusive\r\nof five officers).\r\n\r\nIn years to come, when the nation has realised that for its own\r\nsafety every male citizen must be trained to arms, students of\r\nregimental history will wonder how so many partially instructed\r\ntroops found their way into the ranks of the Royal Irish. Neither the\r\nmilitia nor the volunteers were liable to serve abroad in case of\r\nwar, but as has been said in Chapter x., in the militia a reserve of\r\nmen had been established, picked for physique and character, who in\r\nreturn for a small annual retaining fee had assumed the liability to\r\nserve in time of war as regular soldiers in any part of the world.\r\nAs soon as the reserve of the regular army was called out, these\r\nmen were summoned to the depôt of their territorial regiments, and\r\ngradually sent out to the battalions in South Africa. The militia\r\nreservists joining the Royal Irish were for the most part hardy,\r\nthough not highly trained peasants who after a short experience in\r\nthe field became very valuable soldiers. When the United Kingdom\r\nbegan to understand that the campaign in South Africa was developing\r\ninto the most difficult and arduous war she had waged for nearly a\r\ncentury, all branches of the Auxiliary Forces volunteered for active\r\nservice. The regiments of Yeomanry became the nucleus of the mounted\r\nforce sent to South Africa under the name of Imperial Yeomanry:\r\nmany militia battalions went out as complete units, and volunteer\r\nbattalions were permitted to form from their ranks companies of\r\npicked officers and men, whose function it was to reinforce the\r\ninfantry of the line at the seat of war. The Royal Irish were\r\nfortunate in their volunteer company, which was well officered and\r\ncomposed of men mostly Irish by descent, whose trades as engineers,\r\nboilermakers, fitters, carpenters, and bricklayers had developed both\r\ntheir muscles and their brains. The company landed on March 11, but\r\non its way up country, to use the slang of the South African war,\r\nit was “snaffled on the L. of C.,” or in other words, detained at\r\nvarious posts on the lines of communication, where all ranks learned\r\nso much of their duty in the field that a week after they joined\r\nat Bloemfontein they were considered fit to take their turn at the\r\noutposts: and in the forcing-house of active service they speedily\r\ndeveloped into a very useful body of men.\r\n\r\nWhen the militia reservists and the volunteers reached Bloemfontein\r\nit was anything but a cheerful place, for enteric still raged in\r\nthe hospitals, and the road to the cemetery was daily trodden by\r\nlong processions of soldiers, bearing on their shoulders stretchers\r\nwhereon rested the bodies of the comrades whom they were carrying to\r\nthe grave. To counteract these depressing influences the officers\r\norganised rifle meetings, inter-company football matches, and\r\nathletic sports of various kinds. The effect of these amusements was\r\ngood, but better still was the news that the brigade was once more to\r\ntake the field, when on the 17th of May General Clements was ordered\r\nto entrain his command to Winburg, a little town about sixty-five\r\nmiles north-east of Bloemfontein.\r\n\r\nSince the battalion had landed at Port Elizabeth the military\r\nsituation had improved marvellously. Ladysmith, Kimberley, and\r\nMafeking had been relieved. Lord Roberts had forced his way across\r\nthe south-east of the Free State, captured Cronje with 4000 burgers\r\nat Paardeberg on February 27, and entered Bloemfontein on March 13,\r\nto find that the enemy had scattered northwards before him in panic.\r\nWhen the burghers who faced Gatacre and Clements in the north of Cape\r\nColony heard of Cronje’s surrender, they fell back into the east\r\nof the Free State, leaving rear-guards to watch the Orange river,\r\nand if possible prevent the British from crossing it at Bethulie\r\nand Norval’s Pont. Lord Roberts’ first care on reaching the capital\r\nof the Free State was to join hands with Gatacre and Clements; to\r\nmake himself master of the railway from Bloemfontein to the Orange,\r\nand to secure the waterworks on which the troops were dependent for\r\npure water. From the country west of the railway no serious attack\r\nwas anticipated, but as there was danger that the large number of\r\nBoers who had betaken themselves to the mountainous regions in the\r\neast of the Free State might rally, destroy the waterworks, and\r\ncut the railway--the line of communication with the coast--the\r\nCommander-in-Chief sent a strong mounted flank-guard into the hills\r\neast of the waterworks, while with smaller detachments he covered\r\nthe right or eastern side of the railway. At the end of March and\r\nbeginning of April these flank-guards were overtaken by a series of\r\nmisfortunes: the largest and most important was defeated with heavy\r\nloss at the waterworks in an engagement known as Sannah’s Post;\r\nthe second was captured at Reddersberg; a third narrowly escaped\r\na similar fate by a hasty and exhausting retreat;[292] at Wepener\r\nonly did we still hold our ground. Yet, though these reverses were\r\nannoying, their effect was very transitory, for the Boers failed to\r\nseize the opportunity of falling upon the railway, and by frittering\r\naway their strength in an unsuccessful siege of Wepener allowed an\r\nuninterrupted stream of supplies to reach the army at Bloemfontein.\r\nStrengthened by large reinforcements from England and from Natal,\r\nLord Roberts then began a series of manœuvres by which he succeeded\r\nin pushing the enemy backwards towards their eastern fastnesses, and\r\nat the end of April the danger to the line of communication was so\r\ngreatly diminished that he was free to resume the main object of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief’s plan was as vast as it was simple. Upon\r\nPretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, were to converge several\r\ncolumns working on a front nearly three hundred miles in length. On\r\nthe extreme right of the line, General Buller was to sweep the Boers\r\nout of the mountains of northern Natal, where they had established\r\nthemselves after they had been obliged to abandon the siege of\r\nLadysmith. Far away on the extreme left, a force, based on Kimberley\r\nand commanded by Lieutenant-General Hunter, was to relieve Mafeking\r\nand invade the Transvaal from the west. Lord Roberts was to lead the\r\nmain army along the railway from Bloemfontein to Pretoria, with his\r\nleft covered to some extent by Lieutenant-General Lord Methuen, who\r\nwas to move northwards through the west of the Free State; his right\r\nwas to be guarded by two strong columns under Lieutenant-Generals\r\nIan Hamilton and Colvile,[293] while to Lieutenant-General Rundle,\r\nwho commanded the recently landed 8th division and the body of South\r\nAfricans styled the Colonial division, was entrusted the duty of\r\npreventing raids upon the railway between Bloemfontein and the Orange\r\nriver by commandos from the hilly country east of the line. The area\r\nwhich Rundle had to watch has been described as “the granary and the\r\nmanœuvre ground of the Orange Free State, a region dotted with towns\r\nand villages, wealthy in crops, and abounding in the water-courses,\r\nridges, and kopjes on which the Boers had fashioned their favourite\r\ntactics. Here men could both hide in safety and subsist in ease;\r\nthe harvest of the past year had been too rich for its owners to\r\nbe willing to desert their stores. The region, in short, formed an\r\nirresistible attraction both to farmers and fighting men; and it\r\nflanked the British communications from end to end.”[294] In a series\r\nof successful skirmishes Rundle gradually pushed the enemy before\r\nhim, and by the middle of May his line stretched from Clocolan to\r\nWinburg. Lord Roberts had entered Kroonstad on the 12th, and so\r\nsatisfactory did the situation in the south-east of the Free State\r\nthen appear that a redistribution of the forces was sanctioned, in\r\nthe course of which the 12th brigade was ordered from Bloemfontein to\r\nWinburg.\r\n\r\nFor a few days after its arrival the battalion was employed in\r\nbuilding sangars at various points round the town, and as no enemy\r\nappeared to test these works many a young soldier thought that his\r\nlabour had been wasted; but this was not the case, for when at the\r\nend of August the place was suddenly attacked, the fortifications\r\nthrown up by Clements proved of great value in the defence, in which\r\nsome of the mounted infantry of the regiment took part. On May 26,\r\nthe battalion started for the town of Senekal, now the advance\r\nbase in the eastern Free State, and during a three days’ “trek”\r\nrealised the truth of the camp saying that the march of a British\r\ncolumn in South Africa could be traced by “bully-beef” tins and dead\r\nanimals, for the dreary, dusty, khaki-coloured plain was littered\r\nwith empty rations cases, and with the carcases of mules and oxen\r\nabandoned by the troops as they pressed forward to the front. With\r\nthis very uninviting piece of country the Royal Irish were destined\r\nto make further acquaintance, as during the month of June they\r\nfurnished several strong escorts to convoys over the forty miles of\r\nroad between Senekal and the railhead at Winburg. The 12th brigade\r\nremained nearly a month at Senekal, where the Royal Irish, who spent\r\ntwo nights a-week shivering in the works round the town, became\r\npainfully aware that though the winter days on the veld are glorious\r\nthe nights are abominably cold.\r\n\r\nWhile the battalion was at Senekal the Free State burghers under\r\nChristian De Wet had taken the initiative in the eastern part of\r\ntheir republic: they had made prisoners of considerable detachments,\r\ncaptured large and valuable convoys, and by breaking up the railway\r\nat several points to the north of Bloemfontein had interrupted the\r\nline of communication with Pretoria, where Lord Roberts, after\r\noccupying Johannesburg, had hoisted the British flag on the 5th of\r\nJune. Among the measures at once taken by the Commander-in-Chief\r\nfor the pacification of the Orange Free State was the formation of\r\nstrong flying columns to penetrate into the districts in which the\r\nburghers were still in arms. One of these columns was to be commanded\r\nby Clements, who, with his own brigade and that of Major-General A.\r\nH. Paget (the 20th), was to march upon Bethlehem where a considerable\r\nnumber of the enemy were known to be assembled. With nearly 5000\r\nmen[295] Clements left Senekal on June 28, bound in the first place\r\nfor Lindley, a village forty miles to the north-east, where he was\r\nto join hands with Paget before moving towards Bethlehem. The column\r\nmarched in what the troops called “the picture-frame formation”: half\r\nbattalions in very extended order formed the front, sides, and rear\r\nof a vast hollow square, covering two or three miles of ground, while\r\nthe mounted troops scouted widely in every direction. At Klipplaat\r\nDrift, three miles from Senekal, the Boers opened fire upon the\r\nadvance-guard with four guns, a pom-pom, and a maxim, and made so\r\nstout an opposition that Clements had only gained seven miles when\r\nthe approach of night obliged him to bivouac, with the enemy still\r\nin strength on his front and flanks. Though most of the work fell\r\non the mounted troops, part of the Royal Irish regiment was engaged\r\nduring the afternoon. A young officer who had recently brought out a\r\nnumber of recruits to the battalion thus describes his experiences in\r\nthis, his first engagement: “The regiment was the left flank-guard.\r\nIt was the first time that many of us had been in action, and we\r\nrealised the truth of the saying that ‘it takes a ton of lead to\r\nkill a man,’ for though for several hours we were under a hot rifle\r\nfire from invisible enemies at more or less effective range, with\r\nshells falling among us, I don’t think we lost more than one man\r\nkilled.[296] Our militia reservists were splendid in their ignorance\r\nof danger. As the bullets were whistling over their heads one of them\r\nwas heard to ask his comrade whether ‘it was the birds making that\r\nnoise!’ He must have been brother to the man who, when ordered to set\r\nhis sights at a prescribed range, explained his failure to do so by\r\nsaying that he ‘didn’t know figures.’”\r\n\r\nBefore daylight next morning the mounted troops dashed upon a ridge\r\nabout a mile and a half from the bivouac, forestalling the burghers\r\nin its occupation. The Boers thereupon fell back in the direction\r\nof Bethlehem, leaving a rear-guard who first harassed the troops by\r\nlong-range “sniping,” and then disputed the passage of a drift at\r\nthe Zand river. In the course of this day’s skirmishing a private\r\nin the battalion was wounded.[297] After Paget and Clements joined\r\nhands they turned towards Bethlehem, thirty miles to the south-east\r\nof Lindley, and pushed through bodies of the enemy who, though they\r\nappeared unwilling to commit themselves to anything but a feeble\r\nskirmish, watched every movement with the eyes of a lynx, determined\r\nto lose no opportunity of punishing any carelessness on our part.\r\nThanks to Clements’ vigilance, his column was very little harassed on\r\nthe march, but a strong flank-guard on Paget’s left was very roughly\r\nhandled: a battery was rushed, and for several minutes the guns\r\npassed into the hands of the burghers, from whom they were rescued\r\nonly after a sharp fight.\r\n\r\nClements bivouacked on the 5th of July at Bontjeskraal, about eight\r\nmiles north-west of Bethlehem, and with a column greatly reduced in\r\nnumbers by the absence of the Malta mounted infantry[298] and the\r\nBedfordshire, who by the order of the Commander-in-Chief had been\r\nsent back to garrison the village of Lindley, he advanced early next\r\nmorning through scenery thoroughly characteristic of this part of\r\nSouth Africa. A broad valley, bounded by flat-topped, square-sided\r\nkopjes bare of vegetation and forbidding of aspect, descended by a\r\ngentle slope towards the belt of rolling downs by which Bethlehem is\r\nencircled and commanded on every side. As the Royal Irish, who were\r\nin advance-guard, cautiously made their way down this valley, they\r\ncaught distant glimpses of the trees and scattered houses of the\r\nsettlement, standing like an oasis of civilisation in a wilderness of\r\nveld, while far to the south the horizon was bounded by the mountains\r\nof the Brandwater Basin--range upon range of fantastically-shaped\r\npeaks white with freshly fallen snow, as yet unmelted by the morning\r\nsun. The troops had little time, however, to admire the weird\r\nbeauty of the scene, for the burghers had revealed their presence\r\nby shelling the outposts at dawn, and as the advance-guard began to\r\ndebouch it came under fire from the position, strong by nature and\r\nimproved by fortification, where five thousand men with seven pieces\r\nof artillery awaited our attack. From Vogelsfontein, a farm three\r\nmiles north-east of the town, their line curved outwards along the\r\nwestern rim of the depression in which Bethlehem stands, and then\r\nturning sharply to the east ended at Volhuter’s Kop, a grim pile of\r\nrocks dominating all the approaches from the south. Before Clements\r\nallowed the advance-guard to become seriously engaged, he sent a flag\r\nof truce to the officer in command of the burghers to demand the\r\ninstant surrender of the town, but after receiving a laconic refusal\r\nfrom Christian De Wet[299] he began to carry out the scheme already\r\nconcerted with General Paget. The enemy’s flanks were first to be\r\nturned by the mounted troops and then assaulted by the infantry; the\r\n20th brigade was to carry Volhuter’s Kop on the south; the 12th\r\nbrigade to make itself master of Vogelsfontein farm on the north.\r\nThe plan was a simple one, but it miscarried, as owing to the great\r\nlength of De Wet’s position, the difficulties of the ground, and the\r\nfailure of the mounted men on our extreme left to make their way\r\nover a rocky watercourse, the movements of the infantry were greatly\r\ndelayed, and though late in the afternoon Paget won a little ground,\r\nthe 12th brigade made no material progress, and when night put an end\r\nto the engagement neither of the enemy’s flanks had been turned, or\r\neven threatened seriously.\r\n\r\nWhen the 12th brigade deployed, the Royal Irish were on the\r\nright, the Worcestershire on the left, the Wiltshire in support.\r\nAbout 1 P.M. the XVIIIth advanced in column of double companies,\r\nwidely extended, the leading companies each formed in two lines of\r\nskirmishers with ten paces interval between the men and two hundred\r\nyards’ distance between the lines. Very soon shells from guns\r\nscattered along a ridge about five thousand yards to the eastward\r\nbegan to fall among them, and for a time our artillery gave no great\r\nhelp, until a field-battery dashed through the ranks, caught up half\r\na company to serve as escort, and pushed on to a ridge where it\r\ncame into action. The burghers at once turned their pieces against\r\nthe audacious battery, and thanks to this diversion the battalion\r\nhad been able to move forward to within rifle-shot of the enemy’s\r\ntrenches, when an order brought it to a halt. For the rest of the day\r\nthe Royal Irish remained stationary, skirmishing with the enemy in\r\ntheir front, annoyed by marksmen concealed in the houses of the town,\r\nand enfiladed by rifle and maxim fire from a hill upon their right.\r\nSo biting indeed was the musketry from this hill that to escape it\r\none of the companies was forced to take cover in a donga, where it\r\nremained till nightfall, when the XVIIIth was ordered to withdraw and\r\nbivouac at a farm out of range of the enemy’s rifles. In the opinion\r\nof the rank and file the only good point in this weary day’s work\r\nwas that though the battalion had been engaged for several hours it\r\nhad only two men wounded, but the General knew that the time had not\r\nbeen wasted, for he had seen so much of De Wet’s position that he was\r\nable to recast his plans, and had now determined, while not relaxing\r\nhis efforts to turn the flanks, to deliver a crushing blow at the\r\ncentre of the Boer line, where it rested on a hill half a mile to the\r\nnorth-west of Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nLong before daybreak on the 7th the troops began to take their\r\nplaces for the renewed attack; and the Royal Irish stumbled over the\r\nuneven surface of the veld until they were halted at daybreak by\r\nColonel Guinness, who pointed out to his officers the dim outline of\r\na kopje, just visible in the uncertain light. This hill, he said,\r\nGeneral Clements considered the key of the position: it was to be\r\ntaken at all cost; the Royal Irish had been selected to deliver\r\nthe assault, and three companies of the Wiltshire regiment were to\r\nsupport them in second line. As the mists of dawn gradually cleared\r\naway the officers realised that their objective was the very hill\r\nfrom which their right had been harassed by musketry on the afternoon\r\nof the 6th; they knew that it was strongly held, for a patrol from\r\none of their outposts, reconnoitring it during the night, had heard\r\nthe voices of many burghers talking in the trenches; and they could\r\nsee that a long slope, bare of cover and exposed throughout to the\r\nenemy’s fire, led up to its crest, where two guns had been posted\r\nwithin the last few hours. If our gunners succeeded in beating down\r\nthe defence, the hill would be comparatively easy to carry; but if\r\nthe stress of battle compelled them to turn their projectiles in\r\nanother direction, many a good soldier would fall before the day\r\nwas won. As soon as it was light enough for the artillerymen to\r\nsee, the field and 5-in. guns opened a slow, well-aimed cross-fire\r\nupon the hill, and the Royal Irish prepared for the attack. Colonel\r\nGuinness formed his battalion in three lines: the first consisted of\r\nB company; the second (the supports) was composed of H, G, and C, in\r\nthe order named from right to left; in the third (the reserve) were\r\nF, E, and D companies. One company, A, which had been on outpost\r\nall night, did not rejoin till the position was nearly won. The\r\nsupports and reserve were in lines of columns of half companies,\r\nwhose extensions were not to exceed three paces. Before 7 A.M. the\r\nscouts of B company became warmly engaged with the burghers, who\r\ncould be seen in strength upon the hill; Captain Daniell reinforced\r\nthem with half his company (H), and then for a long time a fierce\r\nfire-fight raged, the Boers trying to crush B company with musketry\r\nand shrapnel, while Daniell’s men kept up a vigorous fusilade to\r\ncover the supporting companies, which were gradually making their way\r\ninto the front line. D company ranged up on the left, the volunteers\r\non the right; while still farther to the right G company came into\r\naction, firing heavy volleys. The expenditure of cartridges was\r\ngreat, and during this phase of the combat the pouches of D company\r\nwere replenished at least four times by the ammunition carriers, who,\r\nto quote from Captain Daniell’s diary, “walked about, backwards and\r\nforwards, up and down the firing line without the slightest fear. I\r\nspecially noticed a lad named Hanrehan and Lance-Corporal Ryan, the\r\ncompany tailor.” Whenever the officer commanding a company considered\r\nit was possible to push on, the subaltern or sergeant in charge of\r\neach section selected two soldiers, who dashed forward for about\r\nthirty yards, and then dropping on the ground covered the advance\r\nof their comrades with their shots. Then followed another pair, and\r\nyet another, until the whole of the section was in its new position,\r\nwhen its commander, who had superintended the movement, in his turn\r\ndashed over the bullet-swept ground. Troops less highly trained, less\r\nperfectly disciplined than the Royal Irish, would have required an\r\nofficer to head them in these rushes, but the men of the XVIIIth\r\ncould be trusted to advance and to carry out their orders without\r\nsuch leading; the difficulty was not to get them to go on, but to\r\nprevent their going on too fast and too far. Whenever the ground was\r\nfavourable the companies were “pulled together” and steadied, to\r\nprepare them for the next rush. A sergeant in the Royal Irish thus\r\ndescribes his impressions of\r\n\r\n  “the first fair stand-up fight the regiment had been in during\r\n  the war. We advanced to a real attack such as you read about in\r\n  textbooks, over comparatively level ground affording scarcely any\r\n  cover, and with due attention to intervals between individuals\r\n  and firing line, supports, and so forth. A very frosty morning,\r\n  bright and bracing; a steady controlled fire to greet us as we\r\n  deployed for attack; a G.O.C. implicitly believed in by every man\r\n  in the battalion; a C.O. who possessed every one’s confidence;\r\n  and officers in front (too much so indeed) to lead the way--such\r\n  were our surroundings. In the ranks one cannot see much in a\r\n  general engagement, but I have a distinct recollection of there\r\n  being a total lack of confusion during the action: signals, words\r\n  of command, were quickly responded to; the passing of orders was\r\n  rapidly carried out; volunteers for every purpose were numerous;\r\n  wounded men were instantly cared for and taken back to the\r\n  dressing-station by the stretcher-bearers.”\r\n\r\nThe battalion gained ground, but not rapidly, for the opposition\r\nwas considerable and the firing line had been again reinforced,\r\nwhen just as the leading men had reached a belt of burned grass, on\r\nwhich their khaki clothing was unpleasantly conspicuous, they were\r\nbrought to a sudden halt by a donga--a natural moat protecting the\r\npart of the hill on which the enemy’s guns were posted. As this\r\ndonga was impassable, the only thing to do was to turn it; and each\r\ncompany successively moved off to the right in perfect order, circled\r\nround the head of the obstacle, and then re-formed in the required\r\ndirection as steadily as though on parade in a barrack square. At\r\nthis moment our bombardment swelled into a violent cannonade. Our\r\nmusketry had already made itself felt among the defenders of the\r\nhill, and when the shells began to rain upon them, the burghers, who,\r\nin the words of an artillery officer, “had hitherto stuck to their\r\nwork like men,” lost heart, and gradually quitted their trenches,\r\nleaving to a few of their gunners the task of saving the guns. These\r\ngallant fellows succeeded in getting one away in safety, and did not\r\ncease their efforts to remove the other until a mass of Royal Irish,\r\nyelling like demons and with bayonets fixed, were within a couple of\r\nhundred yards of them. Then they turned and fled for their lives, and\r\nthe gun, one of the 15-prs. lost by the 77th battery at Stormberg,\r\nonce more passed into the hands of its lawful owners. While part of\r\nthe battalion established itself on the crest of the hill, where a\r\nlong line of trenches, cut deep into the rock, showed how diligently\r\nthe Boers had fortified this part of the position, the remainder\r\nwas held in readiness to push forward into the town. But with the\r\ncapture of the hill the engagement virtually ended; Paget, with\r\nthe help of two companies of the Royal Irish, made himself master\r\nof Volhuter’s Kop almost without loss: Vogelsfontein was occupied\r\nwithout resistance, and the burghers streamed away in full retreat,\r\nfollowed only by the shells of the artillery, for the mounted troops\r\n(chiefly Imperial Yeomen and Australian Rifles) were still too new\r\nto their work to be launched in pursuit of an enemy who never proved\r\nmore formidable than in a rear-guard action. The comparative ease\r\nwith which the Boers were driven out of Bethlehem was owing to the\r\nfact that De Wet had learned that a column of British under General\r\nHunter was moving down on him from the north;[300] as he felt unable\r\nto make head against this reinforcement, he had only fought to gain\r\ntime for his main body to join the large number of Free Staters, who\r\nfrom behind the Wittebergen range faced General Rundle and the 8th\r\ndivision. To this is due the small number of casualties on the 6th\r\nand 7th of July, together amounting only to a hundred and six killed\r\nand wounded--a total to which the Royal Irish contributed almost\r\nhalf. Among the officers Captain J. B. S. Alderson was mortally, and\r\nCaptain T. Warwick-Williams (volunteer company) slightly, wounded; of\r\nthe other ranks, two were killed, four died of their injuries, and\r\nforty-seven were wounded.[301]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the engagement was over the troops were allowed to fall\r\nout and cook their food; fires sprang up everywhere, and while some\r\nof the men made porridge from meal found in a neighbouring farm,\r\nothers tried to convert the burghers’ pigs into pork. An officer\r\nthus describes the scene: “One of the volunteers pursued a very old\r\nbeast with a field-telegraph pole poised above his head; when he\r\ngot within striking distance he brought it down with a crash, but\r\nof course by the time it reached the ground the pig was well away.\r\nThen up galloped one of Brabant’s Horse, who with bayonet fixed\r\ntried to use his rifle as a hog-spear; he lunged at the pig, missed\r\nit, buried his bayonet in the ground, and came a lovely cropper off\r\nhis horse. This old pig was a wary brute, and after running many\r\nrisks, escaped unhurt.” In the course of the afternoon some of the\r\nofficers of the battalion were allowed to visit Bethlehem, which\r\nthey found no better and no worse than the other towns in the Free\r\nState. In this part of South Africa every settlement had the same\r\ngeneral characteristics. In the middle of an unpaved, undrained, and\r\nevil-smelling market square was a large church, built at the expense\r\nof the congregation by an architect who apparently took a barn as his\r\nmodel of ecclesiastical architecture. The square was fringed with\r\nthe most important buildings in the place--the government offices,\r\nthe bank, the stores, and the hotels--not standing side by side,\r\nbut apparently dropped down from the sky at random, with great gaps\r\nbetween them, where loose cattle roamed at will. The dwelling-houses\r\nwere scattered along the roads leading from the church to the open\r\nveld. Those belonging to British traders and to burghers who had\r\nacquired a veneer of European civilisation stood in pretty gardens,\r\ngay with flowers and planted with trees, and looked like small “villa\r\nresidences” transported from a London suburb to the wilds of South\r\nAfrica. The abodes of the old-fashioned Boers, on the other hand,\r\nwere nothing but cottages built of sun-dried bricks, without a tree,\r\na flower, or a blade of grass to mitigate their hideousness.\r\n\r\nA few hours after the occupation of Bethlehem General Clements issued\r\nthis general order:--\r\n\r\n  “The G.O.C. wishes to congratulate the force under his command\r\n  on the way in which it has acquitted itself during a trying\r\n  time since it marched from Senekal. The mounted troops had very\r\n  hard work, and have seen a good deal of fighting. The artillery\r\n  have performed most excellent work and made excellent practice.\r\n  The infantry have had hard work, continuous marching, and done\r\n  excellently while in contact with the enemy. The Royal Irish\r\n  regiment particularly distinguished itself to-day. To one and\r\n  all the thanks of the G.O.C. are due, and he has the utmost\r\n  confidence that the 12th brigade force as now constituted will\r\n  continue to maintain the high reputation it has already won.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTALION.\r\n\r\n1900-1902.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICA (_continued_).\r\n\r\nSLABBERT’S NEK: THE BRANDWATER BASIN: BERGENDAL: MONUMENT HILL:\r\nLYDENBURG: THE MOUNTED INFANTRY OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after Bethlehem was taken, General Hunter’s column entered\r\nthe town, and Clements fell back towards Senekal to obtain the\r\nsupplies of which his men were much in need. After a week’s halt at\r\nBiddulphsberg, the 12th brigade was recalled by General Hunter, now\r\nin command of the whole of the troops in the eastern Free State,\r\nto take part in a great combined movement against the burghers who\r\nhad retired into the hilly region drained by the river Brandwater,\r\nand locally known as the Brandwater Basin. It is bounded on the\r\nsouth by the river Caledon, the frontier of the native state of\r\nBasutoland, whose savage warriors, longing for a pretext to attack\r\ntheir hereditary enemies the Boers, stood ready to resist any\r\nviolation of their territory, and thus forbade the passage of the\r\nstream. To the west, north, and east the basin is enclosed by high,\r\nalmost continuous ranges, which, springing from the right bank of\r\nthe Caledon, form a huge horse-shoe, whose northern foot-hills sink\r\ninto the plain a few miles south of Bethlehem. This mountain wall is\r\nabout seventy miles in perimeter, and is crossed at five places by\r\nroads fit for wheeled traffic: the western face (the Wittebergen)\r\nis pierced by Commando Nek, the northern by Slabbert’s and Retief’s\r\nNeks, the eastern (the Roodebergen) by Naauwpoort Nek and the Golden\r\nGate. Very soon after Hunter arrived at Bethlehem, he decided to\r\nfight his way with part of his force into the Brandwater Basin from\r\nthe north and west, and to drive the burghers into the arms of\r\ndetachments posted at the mouths of Naauwpoort Nek and Golden Gate:\r\nbut before this plan could be carried into effect he had to wait for\r\nsupplies of food and ammunition, and it was not until a fortnight\r\nafter the occupation of Bethlehem that his troops were ready to\r\nbegin work. On July 21st, his army was thus distributed: Rundle with\r\nthe 8th and Colonial divisions stretched from Ficksburg to Senekal;\r\nthe brigades of Clements and Paget lay at Wit Kop and Witnek, a few\r\nmiles north-west of Slabbert’s Nek; the Highland brigade (the 3rd,\r\nunder Major-General MacDonald), stood at Bethlehem ready to march\r\non Retief’s Nek; and Major-General Bruce-Hamilton with the 12th\r\nbrigade, to which part of the Royal Irish mounted infantry had been\r\nattached, commanded the exit from Naauwpoort Nek. Next day orders\r\nwere issued for a general attack along the whole of the western and\r\nnorthern line; Rundle was to bombard Commando Nek, while Clements and\r\nMacDonald assaulted Slabbert’s Nek and Retief’s Nek respectively.\r\nClements advanced on the 22nd to Bester’s Kop, the enemy’s outposts\r\nretiring before him towards Slabbert’s Nek. He had only two of his\r\nfour battalions at that moment with him, for the Worcestershire had\r\nbeen temporarily detached, and the Bedfordshire had not rejoined from\r\nLindley.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the draft of ninety-eight non-commissioned officers\r\nand men, with whom Major Lysaght had joined the battalion on the\r\n18th, had a rough introduction to the joys of campaigning in South\r\nAfrica: there was a great storm; rain fell in torrents; many of\r\nthe horses broke loose and stampeded in every direction, and when\r\nthe Royal Irish fell in after a hurried meal of sodden biscuit and\r\nbully beef, they were wet to the skin, and longed for the excitement\r\nof a fight to get their blood once more in circulation. But the\r\nGeneral’s plans had been kept secret, and the Royal Irish, who were\r\nin advance-guard, had no idea that an action was imminent, and\r\ntrudged wearily over the rough surface of the rolling down, scarcely\r\nglancing at the curious line of isolated kopjes which, at intervals\r\nof a mile or more, rose like watch towers across their path. Suddenly\r\ndistant firing was heard; at the sound of the guns the XVIIIth\r\nstepped out vigorously, and soon discovered that Brabant’s Horse, the\r\ncavalry screen to the column, were being shelled by the defenders of\r\nSlabbert’s Nek. As Clements reconnoitred this formidable position,\r\nhe found that its difficulties had not been exaggerated by his\r\nguides--loyal Britons settled in the Free State, who at the outbreak\r\nof the war had placed their local knowledge at the disposal of the\r\nIntelligence department. The Nek, or pass, ran through a defile\r\nabout half a mile in width, overhung by steep, almost precipitous\r\nmountains, and its entrance was partially barred by a low rounded\r\nknoll, with smooth glacis-like sides, seamed with trenches which\r\nswept the ground to the front and flanks. To the left of the defile,\r\nas he looked at it, was a long square-topped kopje, with cliff-like\r\nwalls that only a goat could climb: to the right stretched another\r\nkopje, higher, longer, and more irregular in shape, with five great\r\nspurs projecting from its rugged flank. Above these spurs rose\r\na series of ledges, like the steps of a gigantic staircase; the\r\nhillside was strewn with boulders and honeycombed with caves, and\r\nthe topmost peak raised its snowy crest nearly two thousand feet\r\nabove the plain. The greater part of this kopje was held by the left\r\nwing of the enemy, and Clements realised that until he had taken it\r\nhe could not hope to force the pass; therefore, as soon as his flanks\r\nwere covered by mounted troops, and his artillery had begun to shell\r\nthe trenches on the Nek, he directed Lieutenant-Colonel Grenfell,\r\nwith part of his corps (the 1st Brabant’s Horse) and a few Imperial\r\nYeomanry, to seize one of the projecting spurs. This mission the\r\nirregulars fulfilled, but when they began to scale the ledges they\r\nwere brought to a standstill by a furious burst of musketry; the\r\nGeneral at once ordered two companies of the Wiltshire to occupy a\r\nspur on the right of that ascended by Brabant’s Horse, and directed\r\nthe Colonel of the Royal Irish, who were then about five thousand\r\nyards from Grenfell’s spur, to send two companies to reinforce\r\nthe dismounted troopers. The choice fell on G (Captain Gloster)\r\nand H (Captain Daniell), the former being in command of the whole\r\ndetachment.\r\n\r\nAfter a stiff climb, H company joined Grenfell on one of the ledges\r\nor steps in the kopje, where they found Brabant’s Horse hotly engaged\r\nwith the burghers, who held two tiers of rocks, the lower four or\r\nfive hundred yards up the hillside, the higher about two hundred\r\nyards farther off; another body of the enemy enfiladed the ledge\r\nfrom a donga. In an hour or two Gloster joined Daniell, prolonging\r\nthe line to the left, where, to quote from a letter of Lieutenant\r\nKelly, a subaltern in G company, “we fired wildly at where we thought\r\nthe enemy were, for we could not see a man, but had a good idea, as\r\nthey were shooting uncommonly straight. Brabant’s were on the same\r\nledge with us, and a real cheery lot they were--quite delighted\r\nwith everything and full of jokes.” Just after the Royal Irish had\r\nsnatched a mouthful of food, a message arrived from the General, “as\r\nsoon as you have occupied the spur, send two companies to the top of\r\nthe hill.” Gloster and Daniell reconnoitred the ground, and decided\r\nto “rush” the next belt of rocks, Gloster working up to them from\r\nthe right, while Daniell made a dash across the open. After sending\r\nfor ammunition and filling the men’s pouches, Gloster moved forward\r\nwith half his company, leaving Kelly with the remainder of G company\r\nto support his advance with musketry. Following the plan made by the\r\ntwo captains, Daniell gave Gloster about ten minutes’ start, and\r\nthen pushed on from both flanks, but though Kelly kept up a vigorous\r\nfusilade upon the ridge of rocks, the immediate object of the\r\ncombined attack, the enemy was unshaken, and the bullets fell like\r\nhail among the men of H company as they ran up the slope. Suddenly\r\nGloster’s half company began to appear on the right, moving in such\r\na way as to come under the musketry of Kelly’s party, who from their\r\nposition could not see Gloster’s men; the danger was so imminent that\r\nDaniell himself ran back across the fire-swept zone and ordered\r\nKelly to follow him to the ridge, now held by the leading troops.\r\nWhen they reached the front line they found that Gloster, mortally\r\nwounded, was sinking rapidly. Again to quote his subaltern: “he had\r\nreached the top quite under cover, and in his usual dashing manner\r\nwas pushing forward in front. He climbed up and looked over a rock;\r\nand seeing some Dutchmen quite close, raised his rifle, and as he did\r\nso was shot, as was another man in exactly the same way. The bullet\r\npassed through the right fore-arm and chest. He was a really gallant\r\nfellow, and died nobly.” When Daniell thus succeeded to the command\r\nof the detachment, the situation was very unpleasant. The ledge upon\r\nwhich the men crouched was so commanded by the enemy’s fire that\r\nevery time a soldier peered over it he drew a storm of bullets: and\r\non the left front the burghers seemed to be in force within twenty\r\nor thirty yards of our position. The men were anxious to avenge\r\nGloster’s death with the bayonet, but a charge was impossible, for\r\nit could only have been delivered on a very narrow front and under\r\nconverging fire. There was nothing for it but to lie under the crest\r\nof the ridge, to keep the men on the alert by shooting at the rocks\r\nbehind which the Boers were ensconced, and to report by signal\r\nthat any farther advance would be attended by very serious risk.\r\nFortunately, cartridges never ran short, as the ammunition carriers\r\nwere able to reach the firing line under cover from the left rear,\r\nwhere Lieutenant Panter-Downes with a few men showed so determined\r\na front that he kept the burghers at a respectful distance, and\r\nprevented them from enfilading Daniell’s party.\r\n\r\nWhile Gloster’s detachment was struggling for foothold on the hill\r\nthe battalion marched towards the foot of Grenfell’s spur; on the\r\nway two companies (D under Captain Milner and F under Captain\r\nWhite) were diverted to the left front to watch the burghers in the\r\ntrenches on the pass. The plain that these companies had to cross\r\nlooked perfectly level from a distance, but in reality was a series\r\nof undulations over which without a landmark it was difficult to\r\nmove in the right direction. Such a landmark was found in a cluster\r\nof Kaffir huts, but the Boers had taken the range accurately, and\r\nwhen D company passed between the kraals it was greeted by a storm\r\nof bullets, by one of which Captain Milner was dangerously wounded.\r\nNeither company halted until it was about nine hundred yards from the\r\nworks on Slabbert’s Nek, with whose defenders for the rest of the\r\nday they exchanged a slow but steady fire; and from the right of D’s\r\nline the Boers who were facing Gloster’s party could be plainly seen;\r\n“but,” writes an eye-witness, “we did not dare to shoot much at them,\r\nas they were too much mixed up with our men.”\r\n\r\nAs two companies were acting as escort to the guns, the main body of\r\nthe XVIIIth was now reduced to two companies of regular soldiers and\r\none of volunteers. This skeleton battalion was finally halted about\r\neighteen hundred yards to the left rear of Grenfell’s spur, and in\r\nwidely extended lines, lay for many hours exposed to the shots of\r\nmarksmen, who were so well concealed that they offered a very poor\r\ntarget in return. The headquarter companies of the Royal Irish had\r\nnothing to do except to fire an occasional round in the direction\r\nfrom which the enemy’s bullets came; to listen to the bursts of\r\nmusketry from the hill, and to wonder how long the shells of a\r\npom-pom playing on them from the Nek would continue to fall among the\r\nregiment without doing any harm. Happily only one of these horrible\r\nlittle projectiles found a billet: it shattered the big drum, greatly\r\nto the amusement of every one, except the drummer, who was fast\r\nasleep beside it. The damage to the drum was soon avenged by a 5-in.\r\nshell, which smashed the pom-pom and blew several Boer gunners to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nWhen darkness put an end to the combat, the result of the day’s\r\noperations seemed meagre in the extreme. Brabant’s Horse and\r\nGloster’s detachment of the Royal Irish had doubtless made a\r\nlodgment on the hill to the right of the pass; but they could do no\r\nmore than hold their ground, and could expect no help from the two\r\ncompanies of the Wiltshire, who had failed to establish themselves\r\non the spur which they had been ordered to seize. The works on the\r\nNek had been vigorously bombarded, but their defenders appeared\r\nto be unshaken by the shells of the artillery and the threatening\r\npresence of Paget’s brigade on the left of the guns. But the General\r\nwas in no way dispirited, for excellent news had reached him in the\r\nafternoon. An officer of Brabant’s Horse, who with a small party of\r\nmounted men was watching the outer flank of the big kopje, heard that\r\nGrenfell and Gloster were “held-up” on the ledges, and determined to\r\nascertain if there was no other way to the top of the hill. By “a\r\nmost daring and successful reconnaissance” on foot, he discovered a\r\ntrack leading to the summit, running well to the right of the ledges,\r\nthrough ground apparently unoccupied by the enemy. When Clements\r\nreceived this report he saw that once he had gained possession of\r\nthe top, he could outflank the burghers facing Brabant’s Horse and\r\nthe Royal Irish, drive them before him into the Nek, and then rake\r\nits defences with rifle-fire. As it was then too late to attempt any\r\nimportant movement, he ordered a squadron of Brabant’s (dismounted)\r\nto be at the summit by daybreak next morning, promising them the\r\nsupport of four companies of the Royal Irish and two of the Wiltshire\r\nregiment, who were not to follow the path discovered by the officer\r\nof Brabant’s, but to ascend by a ridge still farther to the right.\r\nWhile most of the infantry bivouacked on the ground they stood on,\r\nfour companies of the Royal Irish were assembled, and moved to the\r\nfarmhouse fixed as the rendezvous of the little column. At 4 A.M.\r\non the 24th Lieutenant-Colonel Guinness, who commanded the combined\r\nforce, began to ascend the kopje, described by General Clements\r\nas “an almost unclimbable hill”; four hours’ desperate scrambling\r\nbrought the Royal Irish, breathless and exhausted, to its highest\r\ncrest, where they found the dismounted troopers of Brabant’s Horse,\r\nwho moving by a shorter and easier route had gained the summit some\r\nlittle time before their comrades of the XVIIIth. Hitherto the march\r\nhad been unopposed, but now a few shots were fired by burghers who\r\nappeared more anxious to retire than to fight. Part of the infantry\r\nthen joined hands with G and H companies whose adventures during the\r\nnight will be told later; the remainder drove the enemy before them,\r\nturned the works upon the Nek, and swept them with musketry from the\r\nleft rear. A great burst of cheering greeted the appearance of the\r\nRoyal Irish on the top of the hill; a general advance was ordered;\r\nthe Boer resistance suddenly collapsed, and by 11 A.M. Clements was\r\nmaster of Slabbert’s Nek.\r\n\r\nAn officer has supplied the author with a very spirited account\r\nof the proceedings of the headquarter companies, from which the\r\nfollowing extracts have been taken:--\r\n\r\n  “We arrived at the farm about 7 or 8 P.M. on the 23rd, without\r\n  transport, and consequently without blankets or food, on the\r\n  coldest night I remember having spent during the war. After\r\n  seeing the men settled and giving them leave to break open their\r\n  emergency rations, we went into the farm building. Here the\r\n  Wiltshire officers who had arrived before us, had already made\r\n  themselves comfortable before a fire in the kitchen, and had\r\n  a chicken roasting for their breakfast. There were six of us,\r\n  and we had had nothing inside us since dawn--hence lowering of\r\n  the moral sense and theft! We had only two emergency rations\r\n  among us: we ate them: they were excellent, but not enough,\r\n  and we eyed that bird hungrily until the Wilts nodded: then\r\n  some one suggested the eating of that chicken. We needed very\r\n  little persuasion to tear it limb from limb, and we devoured it\r\n  hastily, like house-breakers at supper in a burgled house! The\r\n  anger of the Wilts was great when a couple of hours later they\r\n  awoke; they did not suspect us at the time, thinking we had been\r\n  all asleep, and their wrath was directed against the men. So\r\n  warped had our sense of right and wrong become that it was not\r\n  until we had dined them next day in camp that we gave ourselves\r\n  away.... After a few hours’ sleep we--_i.e._, A, D, F, and the\r\n  volunteers, and two companies of the Wiltshire, started on our\r\n  night march, led by Colonel Guinness and a guide, and a more\r\n  miserable time we never had. It was bitterly cold, with a Scotch\r\n  mist blowing sharply down from the hill above us. The necessity\r\n  for secrecy forbade our smoking, and the effort to keep from\r\n  coughing, kicking down stones, and otherwise making a noise was\r\n  very trying. The track lay up a ‘razor-edge’ sort of ridge, very\r\n  slippery and strewn with boulders. The higher we climbed the\r\n  more difficult it became, until finally we were ‘clawing up’ on\r\n  hands and knees, and the last bit, just as there was a glimmer of\r\n  light, was the worst of all: we had to pull each other up by our\r\n  rifles, yet, with precipitous ground all around us, we lost not\r\n  a man.”\r\n\r\nThe column had now reached the shoulder of the kopje, and rested on\r\nthe snow-covered ground for a short time while Colonel Guinness and\r\nthe guide looked for a path towards the top. The path, when found,\r\nproved to be a mere goat-track, on a narrow ledge with a wall of rock\r\non the right hand and a precipice on the left. On this track there\r\nwas only room to walk in Indian file, and\r\n\r\n  “we were about half-way across this bit when the fog lifted a\r\n  little and showed us what a giddy path we were following. It also\r\n  showed us a few slouch-hatted figures on a spur below us. I can\r\n  tell you we company officers were fairly alarmed, caught as we\r\n  were in a place where movement of any sort, except fore or aft,\r\n  was impossible, so it was to our great relief that we discovered\r\n  these men to be a handful of Brabant’s scouts. A few shots were\r\n  fired at us at about 8 A.M. when we got to the real top of the\r\n  hill, by a few Boers, some on a knoll below us and others to our\r\n  front, but these men soon cleared out. The fog was now lifting\r\n  rapidly and the sun came out as we advanced down into position\r\n  on the knoll overlooking the Nek itself and the Boer line of\r\n  retreat. Heavy firing had been going on since dawn, down where\r\n  the rest of the brigade was, and across the valley where Paget’s\r\n  brigade was also trying to force the pass. For some time we saw\r\n  nothing, then a few small mounted parties of Boers were seen\r\n  riding off towards Fouriesberg. We opened fire, the range I think\r\n  being about a thousand yards. This was the signal for a regular\r\n  bolt of the whole Boer force. We fired rapidly on them, but I\r\n  don’t know if we did much execution firing at such a steep angle\r\n  downwards. Our right was hurried forward down the hill, but the\r\n  steepness and difficulty of the ground prevented our getting much\r\n  closer. By the time we had got well down, practically all the\r\n  Boers had cleared out. It was wonderful to see how the men bucked\r\n  up. Before the firing began they were moving about like a lot\r\n  of cripples, ‘dead to the world,’ and anxious only to get a few\r\n  minutes to sit down and sleep in. The moment they realised what\r\n  was going on, all this was thrown off and they were as happy and\r\n  as energetic as a parcel of schoolboys.”\r\n\r\nWhile the headquarter companies of the battalion were doing this\r\nfine piece of rock climbing, G and H were clinging to their ground\r\nwith the utmost determination. As soon as it became dark Daniell\r\nhad posted the men with him, about a hundred of all ranks, along\r\nthe ridge in little detachments of three or four; in front of each\r\npost lay a sentry, flat on his stomach, peering over the rocks to\r\nwatch the movements of the enemy. Up to midnight the Boers “sniped”\r\nassiduously; then the fire died away, and Daniell and Kelly moved\r\nconstantly up and down the line to make sure that the soldiers,\r\nlulled by the sudden silence and exhausted by hunger and fatigue, had\r\nnot fallen asleep. About 4 A.M. on the 24th, Panter-Downes brought\r\nup the remainder of H company: while this welcome reinforcement was\r\nbeing posted there was an alarm, caused by the approach of a number\r\nof Kaffirs whom the Boers had sent to reconnoitre the position:\r\nthe men promptly lined the top of the ridge, and speedily gave\r\nthe burghers to understand that the Royal Irish were quite ready\r\nto receive them! When day broke, says one of the officers who was\r\npresent--\r\n\r\n  “we quickly found out that the enemy were still there, but\r\n  they had left the rocks on our left, so we occupied them. They\r\n  ‘hotted’ us for a bit, but as soon as the companies appeared\r\n  on the top of the mountain they began to disperse. The guns\r\n  kept up a hot bombardment, and very soon we could see the enemy\r\n  beating a retreat all round. We sent down for water and food,\r\n  made ourselves comfortable, and watched the enemy retire.\r\n  Brabant’s brought up our gun and the Hotchkiss, and made some\r\n  splendid practice among the Boers as they left a hill, and we\r\n  saw a good many of them knocked over.... We received tremendous\r\n  congratulations for our part in the battle, especially the charge\r\n  up the hill.... We buried poor Gloster and five men by a tree at\r\n  the foot of the hill.”[302]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Slabbert’s Nek cost only forty-four casualties, of\r\nwhich many occurred among the Royal Irish. Captain W. Gloster was\r\nkilled; Captain E. F. Milner was dangerously wounded; six of the\r\nother ranks were killed, and ten wounded, three of whom died of their\r\ninjuries.[303]\r\n\r\nIn General Clements’ report of July 26, he gave high praise to the\r\n1st battalion, Royal Irish regiment, in these terms--\r\n\r\n  “Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. N. Guinness has again proved himself\r\n  a commanding officer of the first class. His battalion has\r\n  throughout proved itself to be all that could be desired on\r\n  service. His leading of a force on the 24th of July over an\r\n  almost unclimbable hill, and by this means turning the enemy’s\r\n  position at Slabbert’s Nek, is deserving of special mention.\r\n\r\n  “Captain W. Gloster, who I regret to say was killed while leading\r\n  his company at Slabbert’s Nek on the 23rd of July, was an officer\r\n  of great promise. By his death the Service loses a most valuable\r\n  company leader.\r\n\r\n  “Captain E. H. Daniell has proved himself a first-rate company\r\n  leader in difficult circumstances by the handling of his men on\r\n  the 23rd and 24th of July, on both of which dates he showed great\r\n  gallantry.\r\n\r\n  “Lieutenant J. A. M. J. P. Kelly did particularly good service\r\n  on the night of the 23rd of July, in leading his men over an\r\n  open space, 300 yards wide, swept by a heavy cross-fire, and\r\n  maintaining his position all night at close quarters (20 yards)\r\n  from the enemy who were holding the rocks and caves in his front.”\r\n\r\nIn the same report General Clements stated that Major K. P. Apthorp,\r\nwho was temporarily employed as an intelligence officer on his staff,\r\nhad afforded him “very great help until taken prisoner on June 6.”\r\n\r\nThe following non-commissioned officers and private soldiers were\r\nalso mentioned:--\r\n\r\nNo. 4512, Lance-Corporal P. Doyle;[304] No. 4248, Lance-Corporal M.\r\nTytherleigh; No. 4868, Lance-Corporal J. Rathbone; No. 1408, Private\r\n---- Baker; No. 4129, Private ---- Ryan; and No. 5024, Private P.\r\nDumphy, particularly distinguished themselves on the night of July\r\n23. No. 4506, Private J. Kavanagh, who showed remarkable courage and\r\ncoolness on the same occasion, was wounded while carrying a message\r\nacross ground heavily swept by fire.\r\n\r\nAs soon as General Clements learned that the Highland brigade had\r\ndriven the Boers from Retief’s Nek, he marched two or three miles\r\nalong the road to Fouriesburg, the chief town in the Brandwater\r\nBasin, and then encamped. The halt was very welcome; an officer\r\nwrites, “we were all very much done up, especially those who had been\r\nin Colonel Guinness’s night march, and after a good ‘square’ meal and\r\na double issue of rum (Reger, our Quartermaster, surpassed himself\r\non this occasion) there were few of us awake that afternoon.” Next\r\nday the whole of Hunter’s army was in motion. MacDonald was sent to\r\nhelp Bruce Hamilton in the task of sealing the mouths of Naauwpoort\r\nNek and the Golden Gate, the passes by which the Boers might dash\r\neastward into the open country round Harrismith, the principal town\r\nin that part of the Free State. Clements and Paget marched through a\r\nfertile country, well watered and full of prosperous farms, towards\r\nFouriesburg, whither Rundle, who had dislodged the burghers from\r\nCommando Nek, was also hastening. As the advance-guard of the 8th\r\ndivision was the first to reach the goal, Clements’ and Paget’s\r\nbrigades were halted a few miles from Fouriesburg, and did not move\r\nagain until the 27th, when they entered the place after a feeble\r\nopposition from a few snipers dropped by the main body of the enemy\r\nwho, still ignorant that British troops awaited them at the eastern\r\npasses, were retreating at speed towards Naauwpoort Nek and the\r\nGolden Gate. But though most of the burghers were hurrying eastward,\r\nit was necessary to ensure that no detachments should break out\r\nthrough Slabbert’s, Retief’s, or Commando Neks, and so heavy was the\r\ncall upon the infantry to garrison these defiles that Hunter could\r\nonly muster five battalions to drive the Boers into the net spread\r\nby MacDonald and Bruce Hamilton. One of these was the 1st battalion,\r\nRoyal Irish regiment, which with part of the Wiltshire formed the\r\nadvance-guard under Clements on the 28th, when the burghers fought\r\na rear-guard action near Slaap Kranz ridge with great tenacity and\r\ncunning. The position proved to be a very strong one, and Clements\r\nwas unable to oust the enemy from it, though his artillery and\r\ninfantry were engaged throughout the day. Colonel Guinness was\r\nanxious to be allowed to seize a commanding knoll in front of the\r\nleft of the Boer line, which seemed to offer a good base for an\r\nassault upon the pass itself, but General Clements considered that\r\nthe Royal Irish had done enough for the day, and ordered a battalion\r\nof the Scots Guards, recently arrived on the field, to occupy it. At\r\nmidnight they advanced on the main position and found it undefended,\r\nfor the Boers, after checking the whole column for many hours, had\r\nsilently disappeared when they saw that the odds had become too heavy\r\nfor them to face. The casualties of the day amounted to thirty-four\r\nkilled and wounded, the Royal Irish losing one man killed and five\r\nwounded.[305]\r\n\r\nWith the encounter at Slaap Kranz the campaign in the Brandwater\r\nBasin came to an end. De Wet had always opposed the policy of\r\nretreating into the mountains of Fouriesburg, but his views had\r\nbeen over-ridden, and, as mentioned on page 330, he had fought\r\nClements at Bethlehem to gain time for the main body to complete\r\nits concentration in the valley of the Brandwater. When he arrived\r\nthere with his rear-guard, he set himself to convince the members of\r\nhis very unruly army that the fastnesses to which they had betaken\r\nthemselves would prove not a sanctuary but a trap, and urged them to\r\nfollow him in a bold dash into the open veld. His rough eloquence\r\nappeared to convince the majority; his scheme for breaking out of\r\nthe mountains was accepted, and on the night of July 15, he made\r\nhis way with two thousand six hundred men across Slabbert’s Nek,\r\nand headed northwards, in the full belief that within twenty-four\r\nhours the remainder of the burghers would follow him. But as soon as\r\nDe Wet’s commanding personality was removed the Free Staters fell\r\ninto confusion; instead of carrying out the plan to which they had\r\nagreed they began to quarrel among themselves; they lost precious\r\ndays in wrangling over the choice of another leader, and by the time\r\nthat Hunter’s columns were advancing upon the passes they had become\r\ndemoralised, suspicious of their chiefs and of each other. Dry rot\r\nspread so rapidly among them that on the 30th, Prinsloo, who claimed\r\nto have been elected General-in-Chief, surrendered with 4140 men,\r\nthree guns (two of which had been lost by the Royal Horse artillery\r\nat Sannah’s Post), 4000 horses and ponies, many waggons, a large\r\nnumber of rifles, and a million rounds of small-arm ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish saw enough of the prisoners to form an idea of the\r\nmanner of men with whom they had been fighting since the beginning\r\nof the year. The first impression was one of utter astonishment.\r\nWas it possible that this motley crowd of civilians formed part of\r\nthe burgher levies which for many months had constantly opposed and\r\nfrequently defeated the British army? Some were old men with long\r\nwhite beards; others were in the prime of life; others, again,\r\nwere lads not half-way through their teens; none wore a vestige\r\nof uniform, and the majority were dressed in clothes so badly cut\r\nthat no self-respecting peasant in Europe would have condescended\r\nto wear them. Yet among the captives every grade of society in the\r\nFree State republic was represented: there were land-owners, who\r\npossessed tens of thousands of acres and great wealth of flocks and\r\nherds; members of Parliament; civil servants; merchants; lawyers;\r\ndoctors; and last, but by no means least in numbers, “bywohners,”\r\nor poor Boers, who, as they had no land of their own, were allowed\r\nto squat on the estates of their richer neighbours. The land-owning\r\nclass, as a rule, were magnificent men, well-grown, sturdy, and\r\ninured to hardships; constant hunting on their farms had made them\r\ngood rifle shots and excellent judges of distance,[306] and, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, many of them had served in campaigns against\r\nthe Kaffirs. In character they much resembled the British yeomen of\r\ntwo hundred years ago, for although brave, patriotic, and hospitable,\r\nthey were ignorant, obstinate, and deeply distrustful of new men and\r\nnew ideas. A certain number of the professional classes had been\r\nsent in their youth to Europe to complete their education; their\r\ntravels had greatly widened their intellectual horizon, and as they\r\ndid not stay away long enough to lose their sporting tastes or their\r\nhereditary instinct for irregular warfare, they proved a valuable\r\nasset in the Boer army. In dress as well as education these younger\r\nmen presented a curious contrast to their fellow-citizens, who were\r\nstill as uncouth in speech and manners as the original pioneers of\r\nthe Free State, while the Europeanised burghers were dressed in\r\nwell-cut Norfolk jackets, boots, and breeches, and spoke English\r\nadmirably with accents acquired at the Universities of Oxford,\r\nEdinburgh, or Glasgow. The very baggage owned by the prisoners when\r\nthey surrendered showed how wide a difference there was between the\r\nold school and the new. The old-fashioned burghers, however rich they\r\nwere, had gone on active service with their few belongings packed in\r\nold and shapeless carpet-bags; the youngsters took the field with\r\nkit-bags or suit-cases imported from England.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunter’s success in the Brandwater Basin, to which the Royal\r\nIrish contributed not a little, was far-reaching in its results;\r\nin the words of the official historian “it removed in a moment the\r\npossibility of attack in force from the west, which had kept Sir\r\nRedvers Buller’s army chained fast to the railway from Heidelberg\r\ndown to Ladysmith. True, De Wet, Olivier, and other guerillas were\r\nstill at large, but, vagrant and weakened, they were unlikely\r\nseriously to raid Natal across the Drakensberg, an eventuality which\r\nhad never been absent, and with reason, from Sir R. Buller’s mind.\r\nNone had known better than he how vulnerable still that many-gated\r\ncolony was to incursions which would have undone in a few hours the\r\nheavy work of months.”[307] Now General Buller was able to organise\r\na mobile force to march northwards against the Pretoria-Komati Poort\r\nrailway in order to co-operate with Lord Roberts in the invasion of\r\nthe Eastern Transvaal, where the remnants of the Boer army still\r\nkept the field. In this great movement the Royal Irish were destined\r\nto play their part, for on the 1st of August Clements’ brigade left\r\nHunter’s army; on the 9th it marched into Kroonstad, and after\r\nmany halts and delays on the railway reached Pretoria on the 18th.\r\nIt was one of the peculiarities of the war in South Africa that\r\nno General could hope to keep his brigade intact for any length\r\nof time; so far Clements had been fortunate, but now his turn for\r\ndismemberment arrived, and after bidding farewell to the commander\r\nwhom they admired and respected deeply, the Royal Irish were sent\r\noff to Belfast, a station on the Komati Poort line, where they\r\njoined Major-General Smith-Dorrien’s brigade (the 19th) in a column\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton.[308]\r\n\r\nThe battalion was not actively engaged on the 27th of August in\r\nthe battle of Bergendal, though some of the companies on outpost\r\ncame under long-range artillery fire from the formidable position\r\nastride of the railway, which Lord Roberts and Sir Redvers Buller\r\nattacked respectively in front and flank. When the Boers fell back\r\nfrom their carefully prepared entrenchments they retired at first\r\nalong the railway; but under the dispiriting influences of this,\r\nits latest defeat, the burgher army soon began to fall to pieces.\r\nOne column struck southward; a second hurried eastward towards the\r\nPortuguese frontier; while a third, commanded by General L. Botha,\r\nturned northwards and headed for the maze of hills by which the town\r\nof Lydenburg is surrounded. This detachment made so firm a stand\r\nat Badfontein that Sir Redvers Buller, who had been entrusted with\r\nits pursuit, asked for reinforcements, and General Ian Hamilton was\r\nsent to his help with the greater part of his column. Starting from\r\nBelfast on September 3, Hamilton, after two days’ hard marching and\r\ncontinuous skirmishing, succeeded in placing himself on the right\r\nrear of Botha’s entrenched line at Badfontein; the Boers thereupon\r\ndrew off eastward to Paardeplaatz, a huge mountain within distant\r\ncannon-shot of Lydenburg. As a preliminary to dislodging the burghers\r\nfrom this new position, the British troops occupied Lydenburg during\r\nthe morning of the 7th; in the afternoon, after the bivouacs had\r\nbeen formed, the soldiers were allowed to bathe in the creeks; they\r\nwere splashing about in the water, when suddenly two 6-in. guns\r\nbegan to fire from Paardeplaatz, ten or eleven thousand yards off,\r\nand an unlucky shell killed two men of the battalion and dangerously\r\nwounded another.[309] The Royal Irish were at once moved to a place\r\nof safety, and for the rest of the day had the satisfaction of\r\nwatching the Boer gunners waste invaluable ammunition upon the empty\r\nshelters of the bivouac. Next day (the 8th) Paardeplaatz was carried\r\nby the British troops. The Boers held a precipitous hill, 1500 feet\r\nin height, and shaped exactly like a horse-shoe: the only track ran\r\nto the farthest point of the shoe up an ever-narrowing ridge, cleft\r\nasunder in various places by deep dongas, almost impassable even by\r\ninfantry. Two 6-in. guns commanded the path, and lighter guns and\r\npom-poms were posted on various points along the crest. Hamilton\r\nwas ordered to attack in front and to turn the left flank, while\r\nBuller worked round the right of Botha’s line. Although the turning\r\nmovements involved several hours of hard marching and scrambling,\r\nthe frontal and flank attacks were delivered simultaneously, and\r\ncarried the position with a rush. A wing of the Royal Irish (F, G, H\r\ncompanies, and the volunteers) under Major Hatchell were the first\r\ntroops to reach the topmost ridge, which commanded the enemy’s only\r\nline of retreat, a natural causeway a few yards wide, with deep\r\nprecipices on either side of it. This road was crowded with Boers,\r\nwho, after saving their guns, were now in full retreat; the mass\r\npresented a splendid target for musketry, but just as the men were\r\nbringing their rifles into play down fell a mountain mist, completely\r\nveiling the burghers from their view. To pursue amidst the precipices\r\nin such a fog was impossible; the only thing left to do was to fire\r\nvolleys in the direction taken by the enemy, who is said to have\r\nsuffered some loss from these unaimed bullets. The British casualties\r\nwere small; and in the Royal Irish only one man was wounded.[310]\r\n\r\nHamilton now returned to the railway, and then moved eastwards\r\ntowards Komati Poort, over country in places so difficult as to be\r\nalmost impassable. For instance, part of his route lay over hills\r\nso steep that in the ten miles between Godwaan station and Kaapsche\r\nHoop the track rose 2200 feet. To lighten the loads, the wooden cases\r\nenclosing the biscuit tins were removed, and the soldiers were made\r\nto carry their second blankets, usually transported in the waggons.\r\nAs the column toiled up the steep inclines, the troops hauled the\r\nvehicles after them by main force, and when the descent began, each\r\nwaggon was held back by ten men, who steadied it with drag-ropes down\r\nthe worst places on the road. Though Hamilton encountered none of the\r\nenemy, the march was in many ways an exciting one. A company of the\r\nbattalion was crossing a railway bridge only wide enough to carry a\r\ntrain, when the sound of an engine was heard in a cutting hard by,\r\nand an officer who was present wrote--\r\n\r\n  “I know my hair stood on end. A scramble ensued, which is rather\r\n  amusing to _look back upon_. Some of us just slipped over the\r\n  edge and hung on by the sleepers, with the torrent, thirty or\r\n  forty feet below, to fall into, and rocks to land on if you\r\n  missed the water. The train was, however, pulled up before\r\n  getting on to the bridge, and all got safely over. I believe the\r\n  rear-guard saw a lion on the last march down the Kaap valley into\r\n  Kaapmuiden. One of the men in my company woke up one fine morning\r\n  to find a snake asleep beside him. It was with some difficulty he\r\n  was able to persuade his fellows he was not a de Rougemont, and\r\n  when at last they carefully pulled off the blankets--the wretched\r\n  fellow was sweating at every pore with fright--they discovered a\r\n  particularly venomous-looking puff adder coiled up between his\r\n  legs! The snake was duly killed, but I imagine that man will\r\n  never forget the horrible five minutes he must have spent before\r\n  persuading those around he was not blarneying them.”\r\n\r\nOn September 25, Hamilton caught up the advance-guard of the army at\r\nKomati Poort, where an amazing amount of stores and railway plant had\r\nbeen found, but no enemy. On the approach of the British the burghers\r\nhad broken into small bands and disappeared along the Portuguese\r\nfrontier; some returned to their homes and either took no further\r\npart in the war or joined our side; others, to whom all honour as\r\nbrave and determined enemies is due, reassembled to form the guerilla\r\nbands which kept the war alive for twenty-one weary months after the\r\nBoer army had ceased to exist as a formed and organised body of men.\r\n\r\nThe troops composing Hamilton’s column received his thanks for their\r\nexertions in a general order, dated October 1, 1900--\r\n\r\n  “General Ian Hamilton wishes to congratulate his force on the\r\n  fine work which has been performed by them since they marched\r\n  out of Belfast on September 3rd, 1900. During this period they\r\n  have driven the enemy out of his most formidable selected\r\n  positions--first on the main Lydenburg road, where they barred\r\n  the progress of the Natal arms; and secondly, on the height\r\n  overlooking Lydenburg itself. They have also encountered and\r\n  overcome every sort of natural obstacle, and have carried the\r\n  British flag through tracts of waterless bush, and over ranges\r\n  of lofty mountains to the most remote frontier of the enemy. All\r\n  this has been done with so much spirit, and so cheerfully, as to\r\n  excite the G.O.C.’s greatest admiration, who will take the first\r\n  opportunity of informing Lord Roberts of the splendid work done\r\n  by all ranks under his command.”\r\n\r\nIn an unofficial letter, written after the war was over, General\r\nSmith-Dorrien stated that of all the troops which came under his\r\norders in South Africa, “none served me more loyally or gave me\r\nless trouble than the Royal Irish; I have nothing but pleasant\r\nassociations to remember with regard to the time I had the honour of\r\nhaving the battalion under my command.”\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish spent a few days in clearing the railway and in\r\nattending a review of the British troops, held in honour of the\r\nbirthday of the King of Portugal, and then were ordered to entrain\r\nfor Belfast; the journey, by no means an uneventful one, is vividly\r\ndescribed by Captain Dease.\r\n\r\n  “The regiment returned from Komati Poort in several trains, as\r\n  there was an excess of rolling stock on the line which wanted\r\n  moving up towards Pretoria. The Boers had made quite a mess of\r\n  things on the railway. They had fired great numbers of trucks\r\n  and disabled a good many engines. The big bridge across the Kaap\r\n  at Kaapmuiden had also been destroyed, and rather cleverly too.\r\n  They had blown down the upper part of one of the piers, got\r\n  steam up in one of the heavier ‘Free State Railway’ engines, set\r\n  it going from Kaapmuiden station, and succeeded in absolutely\r\n  smashing up the damaged pier, as well as the spans on either\r\n  side. The volunteers and C company did most of the work on the\r\n  building of a deviation and temporary bridge, which was taken in\r\n  hand immediately. We left Kaapmuiden at about 5 P.M. on the 30th\r\n  September. As I had had some mechanical training as a boy, I took\r\n  on the driving of the second train, in which were most of our\r\n  officers. The first train was given five minutes’ grace before I\r\n  was told to start. My fireman was a corporal in the Royal Scots,\r\n  I think, who had ‘been on’ a traction engine at home, while the\r\n  second man was also a soldier from some other regiment, with an\r\n  equal recommendation for his present job! I myself had a fair\r\n  knowledge of locomotive work, but (at that time) little of the\r\n  vacuum brake: anyway, I certainly had not sufficient knowledge\r\n  of the work for the job in hand. All went well till we got to\r\n  the deviation and bridge we had made over the Kaap. Here the fun\r\n  began. The road up the other side was at so steep a gradient\r\n  that I couldn’t get my train up it. We stopped and rolled back\r\n  over the bridge. A second try met with as little success. It\r\n  then occurred to my fireman and myself that if we ‘backed’ up\r\n  the grade behind the bridge, and then rushed forward down on to\r\n  the bridge the momentum would carry us over. This it did, but\r\n  the train must have had a narrow escape of wrecking that frail,\r\n  temporary structure. After this we proceeded ‘with caution,’\r\n  going not more than about 10 miles an hour. Darkness fell about\r\n  three or four miles beyond the Kaap bridge. The ‘road’ here runs\r\n  along the sides of hills, with a steep slope to the Krokodil\r\n  Valley, a couple of hundred feet below. Naturally the curves are\r\n  very sharp, and cuttings numerous. I was very ‘jumpy’ at the\r\n  time, not knowing the road and uncertain of myself as a driver,\r\n  and kept the speed down. It was fortunate I did so, for as we\r\n  rounded a corner a group of men on the hillside shouted to me to\r\n  ‘stop,’ ‘danger,’ &c. I jammed down the air-brake hard and shut\r\n  off steam, bringing the train up with a terrific jerk, to find\r\n  the buffer of my engine within a few yards of the rear of the\r\n  train in front. The sudden pull up had caused quite an upset in\r\n  the trucks behind, as the jerk was hard enough to roll everyone\r\n  and everything in the trucks over. We found that the driver\r\n  of the first train’s engine (also an amateur like myself) had\r\n  allowed the water to run too low in his boiler, melting the plug\r\n  over his fire-box, and rendering the engine totally useless.\r\n  We were still talking about our narrow escape when suddenly\r\n  round the curve behind us were seen the front lights of a third\r\n  train. We happened to have no ‘tail lights,’ and before warning\r\n  could be given our train had been run into with a terrific smash\r\n  from behind. For a few minutes the confusion was indescribable.\r\n  Then things straightened themselves out. A piquet was sent\r\n  some distance down the line to prevent another train colliding\r\n  with the third train, and parties went to work extricating the\r\n  injured. The extraordinary thing was that although quite a\r\n  number of trucks had been ‘piled up’ in our train, nobody was\r\n  killed, and only about thirty or forty hurt. One of the latter\r\n  was Deane-Morgan: he had been standing on the edge of a culvert\r\n  when the crash came, and, without thinking, he involuntarily\r\n  took a step backwards, and dropped about thirty feet or so into\r\n  the bed of a nullah. He hurt his knee badly, but no bones were\r\n  broken--another extraordinary escape.\r\n\r\n  “We spent that night and part of the next morning clearing away\r\n  the wreck, and at last arrived at Krokodil Poort, the next\r\n  station, in the afternoon. The journey thence to Waterval Onder\r\n  was exciting only to me on the engine, as it was performed\r\n  through the night, but peaceful to everyone else.”\r\n\r\nAfter these adventures the Royal Irish reached Belfast on the\r\n4th of October, and at once relieved the troops then holding the\r\noutposts round the town, where the duty was so heavy that when the\r\nCommander-in-Chief ordered the battalion to Pretoria to represent\r\nIreland at the formal annexation of the Transvaal to the British\r\nCrown, only three companies could be spared to take part in the\r\nceremony. Along the whole of the Pretoria-Komati Poort railway, as\r\nindeed on all the lines throughout the theatre of war, every station\r\nwas held as a fortress; every train was guarded by soldiers;[311]\r\nevery bridge and almost every culvert absorbed a detachment, great or\r\nsmall, for its defence; while flying columns were often required to\r\ndisperse the guerilla bands which threatened weak points on the line\r\nof communication. Until December, the Boers in the eastern Transvaal\r\noccupied themselves chiefly in train-wrecking; but on the 28th of\r\nthat month they stormed a strongly entrenched post at Helvetia,\r\ncaptured a large number of men, and carried away in triumph a 4.7-in.\r\ngun. Encouraged by this success, they determined to attack the posts\r\nalong eighty miles of railway; the stations at Pan, Wildfontein,\r\nWonderfontein, Belfast, Dalmanutha, Machadodorp, and Nooitgedacht\r\nwere to be assailed simultaneously, though the main effort was to be\r\nagainst Belfast, where a great depôt of stores and much ammunition\r\nformed a prize worth striving for. Though the headquarters of three\r\nbattalions were stationed at Belfast, the Colonels of the Royal\r\nIrish, the Shropshire Light Infantry, and the Gordon Highlanders\r\ncould muster between them no more than 1300 men--a small number of\r\nfoot soldiers with which to furnish outposts, guard the town and\r\nguns, and reinforce threatened points on the enormous perimeter of\r\nfifteen miles rendered necessary by the formation of the ground\r\naround the place. The remainder of the garrison consisted of two\r\nhundred and eighty of the 5th Lancers, a hundred and eighty mounted\r\ninfantry, a battery of field artillery, and two 4.7-in. guns.\r\n\r\nBelfast was defended by three main groups of works, more of the\r\nnature of detached posts than of outposts in the ordinary acceptation\r\nof the term. South of the railway the Gordon Highlanders were in\r\ncharge of a long stretch of rising ground; on the other side of\r\nthe line the Shropshire Light Infantry held Colliery Hill, to the\r\nnorth-west of the town; while the Royal Irish were responsible for\r\nMonument Hill, a kopje two miles north-east of the centre of Belfast,\r\nand for one of the 4.7-in. guns, which was posted upon it. These\r\nhills, three miles apart, were linked by a party of mounted infantry\r\nat a drift half-way between them. Early on the 7th of January, 1901,\r\nMajor Orr’s detachment at Monument Hill was relieved by Captain\r\nFosbery, who was in command of his own company, A, and of D company\r\n(Captain Milner); Lieutenant Dease was the only subaltern with the\r\nparty, which consisted of ninety-three officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men. Fosbery at once began to improve and complete the\r\npartially finished defences he had taken over from his predecessor,\r\nbut the number of workers at his disposal was not great, for D\r\ncompany had just returned from an exhausting spell of train-escort\r\nduty, and as he wished to allow Captain Milner’s men time to rest, he\r\nkept them in reserve and gave them little to do. By sundown, however,\r\nmuch had been accomplished, and when General Smith-Dorrien came to\r\nvisit the post he was satisfied with the progress made, though he\r\ndisapproved of the loopholes, which he directed should be altered,\r\nbut owing to the darkness it became impossible to carry out this\r\norder, and its execution was postponed till the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe top of the hill is a plateau about eight hundred yards long, and\r\nless than a quarter of a mile in width: at the northern end a rough\r\nstone sangar, four feet high, enclosed the 4.7-in. gun: farther\r\nto the south a semicircular trench partly surrounded the tents\r\noccupied by D company: a short way down the south-western slope of\r\nthe hill a blockhouse of stone and sods was virtually completed,\r\nand scattered along the perimeter of the plateau were eight small\r\ntrenches, two of which were not yet fit for use. By the scheme of\r\nfortification the whole of the post should have been ringed with\r\na strong barbed-wire fence, but at nightfall this portion of the\r\ndefences was not completely finished. After Fosbery had sent two\r\nsections to a subsidiary post connecting Monument Hill with the left\r\nof the Gordon Highlanders, there remained in hand six sections, which\r\nhe thus disposed for the night. Two sections of A company were to man\r\nthe perimeter trenches, with a sentry posted a few yards in front\r\nof each; the remaining section of A with the maxim was to act as a\r\nsupport in the sangar, from which, as will be seen, the 4.7-in. gun\r\nhad been withdrawn; the three sections of D company were to sleep in\r\ntheir tents, but to be ready at a moment’s notice to line the trench\r\nnear their little camp. In the course of the evening a mist settled\r\ndown upon the country round Belfast, so heavy that in the town itself\r\nthe range of vision was limited to twenty yards; on Monument Hill it\r\nwas like a London fog, and effectually prevented patrolling to the\r\nnorth-east, east, and south-east, where the precipitous sides of the\r\nkopje fell into broken ground, difficult even by day to search with\r\nany degree of thoroughness. Thus the safety of the post was entirely\r\ndependent on the vigilance and sharp hearing of the sentries in front\r\nof the trenches.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred to disturb the garrison of Belfast until midnight,\r\nwhen heavy firing, beginning at Monument Hill, then spreading to\r\nColliery Hill, and finally raging at the Gordons’ posts, showed that\r\nthe burghers had surrounded the town and were assailing it vigorously\r\non every side. From information obtained by the British officers\r\ncaptured during the engagement, it is known that General L. Botha,\r\nwho had under him about two thousand men, had allotted to the Ermelo\r\ncommando the task of driving the Gordon Highlanders from the southern\r\nworks: the Middelburg commando was to engage the Shropshire Light\r\nInfantry at the Colliery, but not to press home the attack until\r\nGeneral B. Viljoen, with seven hundred and fifty of the Johannesburg\r\nand Bocksburg commandos, had made himself master of Monument Hill--a\r\npost which was to be carried at all cost, not only on account of its\r\ntactical importance, but also because the burghers were determined\r\nto capture the big gun which they thought was left at night on the\r\ntop of the kopje. Fortunately, during the 7th, General Smith-Dorrien\r\nhad decided that it should be dragged down the hill and back into the\r\nartillery lines at nightfall; and thus the gun was preserved from the\r\nfate which overtook the defenders of the sangar in which the Boers\r\nexpected to find the piece of ordnance they coveted so earnestly.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that of the three officers on Monument Hill one\r\nwas killed and the others wounded and carried away by the enemy,\r\nthe official report of the part played by the Royal Irish is\r\nnecessarily somewhat meagre. But, thanks to a narrative prepared\r\nby Captain Dease, and to information supplied by others who were\r\npresent, it is possible to form some idea of the desperate struggle\r\nfor the possession of the hill. The night piquets were posted at\r\ndusk, and the officers of A company divided the duty between them,\r\nFosbery taking the watch till 2 A.M., when Dease was to relieve him.\r\nEverything was quiet till about a quarter to twelve, when Dease,\r\nwho was in a shelter near the tents of the reserve, heard a distant\r\nchallenge, followed almost immediately by the report of a rifle.\r\nNothing happened, and as nervous sentries often fired at imaginary\r\nenemies, no one was disturbed by the single shot, though, as it\r\nturned out, it was fired not by a British soldier but by a burgher,\r\nwho when the sentry at the north-east trench challenged, shot him\r\ndead. Dease was trying to go to sleep again, when two more rifles\r\nrang out; he dashed out of his shelter, and with Fosbery, whom he\r\nmet in the fog, hurried to the centre of the plateau to ascertain\r\nthe cause of the firing. On the way they came under a sudden\r\nfusilade from a party of Boers who, after scaling the northern and\r\nnorth-eastern slopes of the kopje, had surprised and carried a couple\r\nof the trenches, thus establishing themselves inside our line of\r\nworks. The two officers rushed forward and reached the gun sangar\r\njust as the burghers were advancing upon it.\r\n\r\n  “The fog,” writes Captain Dease, “at this time was extremely\r\n  dense, and the position of the enemy could only be distinguished\r\n  by the flashes of the rifles. The Boers at first concentrated on\r\n  the maxim gun, and a tremendous hand-to-hand combat took place.\r\n  Our men used their bayonets with effect, and some of the machine\r\n  gunners (who had slung their rifles in an abortive effort to\r\n  get the gun to work) set-to with picks, axes, and anything they\r\n  could lay hands on. In short, as the men said, ‘it was the father\r\n  and the mother av a fight!’ The enemy suffered so severely that\r\n  they ceased trying to get over the sangar wall, but remained a\r\n  yard or two on the far side, pouring in a terrific rapid fire at\r\n  the crest line of the sangar. It is difficult to be clear about\r\n  the sequence of events, but I think that among the eighteen men\r\n  originally in the sangar there were only one or two casualties\r\n  during the hand-to-hand part of the fight; but during the next\r\n  phase, when the Boers contented themselves with sweeping the\r\n  crest, we lost very heavily, for our fellows, the lust of battle\r\n  on them after the hand-to-hand fight near the machine gun,\r\n  exposed themselves in a most reckless manner, and were with\r\n  difficulty prevented from getting out of the sangar and charging\r\n  into the enemy. The action had continued for about half an hour,\r\n  when the Boers made a second rush on the gun, and being met at\r\n  that point by a mere remnant, forced us back. At this moment,\r\n  as we were gradually drawing back towards the entrance to the\r\n  sangar, 3733 Private J. Barry,[312] who was nearest the maxim,\r\n  picked up a pickaxe lying near it. As he forced his way to the\r\n  gun through the Boers, efforts were made to stop him, and he had\r\n  just time to drive in the point of the pick into the junction of\r\n  the barrel and breech-casing before he was literally swept down\r\n  by a hail of bullets from the enemy round him.[313] As he was\r\n  shot at by about a dozen burghers within five yards’ distance\r\n  and from all sides, I fancy they must have played havoc in their\r\n  own ranks! Fosbery now realised that the position in the sangar\r\n  was untenable, and shouting out to us to ‘charge through the\r\n  entrance and make for the blockhouse,’ led the way. The Boers\r\n  were there in great force, and we were met with a very hot but\r\n  unaimed fire. Only Fosbery, Corporal Gorman, and myself took\r\n  part in this charge; all the rest of us were either killed or\r\n  wounded. About ten yards from the entrance Fosbery, in trying\r\n  to club down a Boer with the butt of his carbine, was wounded\r\n  in two places: I got a few yards farther, and while occupied\r\n  with a couple of the enemy in front was hit on the head by a\r\n  butt-ended rifle, and temporarily stunned: Corporal Gorman, I\r\n  think, surrendered, but of this I am uncertain, as I was too\r\n  busy to notice what he was doing, as he was behind me. When I\r\n  recovered consciousness about ten, perhaps twenty, minutes later,\r\n  I searched for and found Fosbery, who was still alive. I did what\r\n  I could in the way of first aid, but he was hopelessly hit and\r\n  had already lost a great deal of blood. The Boers were so close\r\n  to him when they shot him down that his clothing was scorched\r\n  all round the wounds. A little after this I suddenly ran into a\r\n  group of wandering Boers, and having lost my carbine when I was\r\n  knocked over, was easily collared and put under escort. But of\r\n  this and all subsequent proceedings I can remember nothing. I had\r\n  been singularly unfortunate in the fight in jamming my revolver\r\n  (a Service Webley) as I reloaded it. It was no good to me, and I\r\n  can remember using it as a missile during the charge--I hope with\r\n  effect! A carbine that night was a useless weapon for officers.\r\n  We had no bayonets, and the short length of the stock and barrel\r\n  placed us at a great disadvantage in the hand-to-hand _mêlée_.”\r\n\r\nWhile the support was fighting desperately in the gun sangar\r\nagainst overwhelming odds, most of the piquets on the perimeter\r\nwere swamped by sheer weight of numbers. Their trenches were of\r\na type found very useful by the battalion in actions where it\r\nhad been exposed to continuous bombardment, such as those in the\r\nColesberg campaign--narrow slits in the ground, 2 feet 6 inches\r\nwide, nearly 5 feet deep, loopholed with a parapet 2 feet in height\r\nand at least 3 feet in width. But excellent as this pattern had\r\nproved elsewhere, it was not a success in very close fighting at\r\nnight, for the trench was so deep that its occupants could not see\r\nover the parapet, and the loopholes were ill adapted for firing\r\non an enemy at a few yards’ range. Around these works parties of\r\nBoers, from twenty to two hundred strong, suddenly loomed up out of\r\nthe fog and closed rapidly from all sides upon the defenders, whom\r\nthey covered with their rifles, demanding instant surrender. Though\r\nthus caught in an absolute death-trap, most of these little groups\r\nof four or five soldiers showed fight, not laying down their arms\r\nuntil one or more of their number had been killed or wounded. Here\r\nLance-Corporal Dowie, a veteran who had served in the Egyptian war\r\nof 1882, met a glorious death. He was in command of a small trench,\r\nwhich he succeeded in holding during the first assault: he refused to\r\nsurrender, though he must have realised that resistance was hopeless,\r\nand with his men continued to fight on desperately until a number\r\nof burghers, rushing in from behind, overwhelmed the party and left\r\nDowie dead in the work he had defended so gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe reserve fared no better than the piquets or the support. When\r\nawakened by the sound of battle, the men of D company manned the\r\nbroad and shallow trench by which, as it has been said, their tents\r\nwere enclosed, though very incompletely. At first the attack came\r\nfrom their front and right, but after the capture of the sangar had\r\nmade the Boers masters of the northern end of the hill, a fresh body\r\nof the enemy fell upon them from the left rear. There was a short,\r\nwild struggle; then the burghers surged forward, and hemmed in the\r\nmen of D so closely that many of them could not use their bayonets,\r\nand while the Boers in front seized the muzzles and pointed them in\r\nthe air, those behind knocked our men down with the butts of their\r\nMauser rifles. By this time Captain Milner was severely wounded:\r\nand those of his company who were not killed, wounded, or prisoners\r\nceased to be a formed body of troops. Singly or in small groups they\r\ntried to make their way towards Belfast, but in the fog they stumbled\r\nacross large parties of the enemy, into whose hands they fell. Out\r\nof the ninety-three officers and men of the Royal Irish on the hill\r\nonly seven escaped; the remainder were killed, wounded, or captives\r\nin the hands of the enemy. Little more than half an hour after the\r\nfirst shot was fired the defence had been beaten down completely, and\r\nthe only sounds to be heard on Monument Hill were the groans of the\r\nwounded, and the hoarse shouts of the burghers as they collected the\r\nrifles and ammunition and sought vainly for the 4.7-in. gun, which\r\nthey hoped to turn upon the garrison of the town.\r\n\r\nWhen the attack began General Smith-Dorrien had only two\r\ncompanies--(one of the Royal Irish and one of the Shropshire Light\r\nInfantry) available as reinforcements for the posts north of the\r\nline. Both companies turned out, stood to their arms, and awaited\r\norders, while Lieutenant-Colonel Spens, Shropshire Light Infantry,\r\nat once reconnoitred towards Monument Hill, and before the firing\r\nhad quite died down, met a soldier who gave him the grim news that\r\nFosbery’s detachment had been cut to pieces. Halting his party, Spens\r\nwent forward with two or three men to ascertain for himself the real\r\nposition of affairs, and, undetected by the enemy, worked his way\r\nup the kopje until he reached a wire fence from which he could see\r\nthe burghers swarming over the camp which they were looting. Then,\r\nconvinced that the post was lost indeed, he withdrew, taking with\r\nhim the men of two small outlying piquets whom the enemy had not\r\ndiscovered, but who, in his opinion, would inevitably be captured as\r\nsoon as the fog lifted. This daring reconnaissance was equalled by\r\nthat of a corporal in the 5th Lancers, who volunteered to find out\r\nwhat had happened to the Royal Irish. He thus described the scene\r\nupon the hill--\r\n\r\n  “I left the road and struck across the veld, and by running,\r\n  creeping, crawling, and rolling I managed to get up to the wire\r\n  entanglements which encircled the post. The difficulty now was\r\n  to get through the wire. I could hear shouts and groans, and\r\n  there was some shooting going on, but whether Briton or Boer\r\n  was in possession I could not tell. I dared not go round the\r\n  entanglement to the entrances, as I knew they would be guarded,\r\n  and so by a series of wriggles soon found myself inside the post.\r\n  What was to be done now? I knew if I were seen I should be shot,\r\n  whoever held the hill, so I continued to wriggle and roll on my\r\n  stomach. I soon came across the effects of the fight, the dead\r\n  bodies of the infantry and Boers, and the tents which had been\r\n  cut down on top of the Irishmen. Some one was calling ‘Water, for\r\n  God’s sake give me water,’ and suddenly a dog barked a few yards\r\n  to my right, and I could just distinguish a man. I immediately\r\n  covered him with my rifle, but apparently he had not seen me. I\r\n  remained where I was for some time, and then slowly crawled back\r\n  a little and worked my way to where I heard the shouts for water\r\n  coming from. I soon found two of the Irishmen badly wounded, and\r\n  asked them in a whisper what had happened, but the only reply\r\n  was a piteous appeal for water. I then crawled some fifty yards\r\n  to the cook-house and found a camp kettle with some water in it,\r\n  and slowly wriggled back to the two wounded men, and filling my\r\n  cap with water gave them a good drink. They then told me that the\r\n  Boers had rushed the sentries in the fog, cutting down the tents\r\n  on their occupants, and shooting and clubbing the men as they\r\n  rushed out, and although the garrison had made a gallant fight\r\n  they were overpowered and the post captured. There was a lot of\r\n  shouting going on by the Boers, and I quietly crawled towards it,\r\n  and then there was a shot. Beyond a man standing on the monument\r\n  I could see nothing, and so gradually crawled back to the wire\r\n  entanglements; as soon as I was clear of these ran back to the\r\n  horses, where I found Sergeant Evans and Aldridge safe, and we\r\n  rode back to camp and made our report.”[314]\r\n\r\nAlong the rest of the line of outworks the enemy pressed home the\r\nattack with great gallantry and determination, but was repulsed\r\nat all important points. The Gordon Highlanders beat back Botha’s\r\nburghers, though with the loss of a small isolated post, and the\r\nShropshire Light Infantry maintained their hold on the vital part\r\nof their position, though also with the loss of a small outlying\r\ndetachment. Only at Monument Hill were the Boers successful, and this\r\nsuccess, obtained solely by overwhelming numbers, they failed to turn\r\nto account. Whether they were dispirited by their losses, bewildered\r\nby the fog, or crippled by the want of trained staff officers to\r\ndirect their movements and carry out Botha’s plans, it is impossible\r\nto say, but the fact remains that beyond capturing some scores of\r\nrifles, a few tents, and much ammunition from the Royal Irish, the\r\nburghers accomplished nothing, and retired so hastily with their\r\nprisoners and booty that when Spens returned in the early morning to\r\nMonument Hill he found it occupied only by the dead and wounded.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Botha’s scheme provided for the\r\nsimultaneous attack on seven posts along the railway. These attacks\r\nwere duly made, but in most cases they were not serious, and in\r\nnone were they successful. The returns prove that Belfast was the\r\nreal objective of the burghers, for out of 179 casualties sustained\r\nin the defence of these seven places, 143 fell upon the troops in\r\nBelfast. The Royal Irish were by far the greatest sufferers; of the\r\nthree officers on Monument Hill, Captain Fosbery was killed, Captain\r\nMilner was severely wounded, Lieutenant Dease injured, and both were\r\ntaken prisoners; while among the ninety non-commissioned officers\r\nand privates eight were killed outright, five died of their wounds,\r\ntwenty-two were wounded in varying degrees of severity, and fifty-one\r\nwere taken prisoner.[315] The Boers on their side also lost heavily:\r\nin the attack on Belfast fifty-eight burghers were killed, of whom\r\nfourteen fell at Monument Hill.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith-Dorrien, in his report on the events of the 7th-8th of\r\nJanuary, stated that the heavy loss in killed and wounded among the\r\nRoyal Irish was “sufficient evidence that their defence was a fine\r\none.” He specially mentioned Captain Fosbery for his “splendid work\r\nin command of the post,” adding that from all sides he heard how well\r\nthis officer had behaved until he was shot down. In Force Orders,\r\ndated the 12th of January, 1901, he expressed his\r\n\r\n  “appreciation of the steadiness of the troops on the morning\r\n  of the 8th. He would specially mention the fine defence of the\r\n  Royal Irish piquet at the monument under that gallant officer,\r\n  Captain Fosbery, whose death he deplores, until overwhelmed by\r\n  vastly superior numbers after a hard fight.... He regrets the\r\n  heavy losses, but does not consider them heavy, considering the\r\n  determined nature of the attack. He also considers that had it\r\n  not been for the fog the attack would have been much more easily\r\n  repulsed.”\r\n\r\nThe General also wrote as follows of Private John Barry:--\r\n\r\n  “I would especially call attention to the heroic conduct of No.\r\n  3733 Private J. Barry, Royal Irish, who seeing the machine gun\r\n  surrounded by Boers seized a pick and began to smash the action,\r\n  which he completed in spite of the threats of the Boers. I regret\r\n  to say that the Boers in retaliation shot him dead, or I would\r\n  have recommended him for a V.C.”\r\n\r\nThe War Office decided to award this honourable decoration to Barry,\r\nalthough he was not alive to wear it, and it was presented to his\r\nwidow to be held as a treasured heirloom in Barry’s family. Thus, for\r\nthe third time since the Order of the Victoria Cross was instituted,\r\ndid a member of the Royal Irish regiment win this, the highest prize\r\nfor valour in the British army.\r\n\r\nFor several days the garrison of Belfast toiled continuously to make\r\ngood the weak points in the defences revealed by the night attack,\r\nand then settled down into the old routine of occasional raids into\r\nthe neighbouring country and frequent skirmishes on the line of\r\ncommunication. A party of the Royal Irish under Captain Grogan had\r\nan extraordinary escape while escorting a train about this time; the\r\nburghers had mined the railway with dynamite and expected to see the\r\ntrain and its guard of soldiers blown sky-high, but their hopes were\r\ndisappointed; a couple of heavily laden trucks in front of the engine\r\nmet the full force of the explosion and were hurled off the rails;\r\nnone of the escort were hurt, and the greater part of the train was\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, F, G, and H companies under Major Orr were sent to\r\nHelvetia, where they spent a fortnight in remodelling the defences,\r\nand then moved on to Lydenburg as escort to a convoy of supplies for\r\nthe troops holding that distant post. Though unopposed by the enemy\r\nthe march was very trying, for the rain fell in torrents, and the\r\nroad, deep in mud, led across three rivers where the water reached to\r\nthe waists of the soldiers as they struggled through the fords. Very\r\nsoon after the convoy reached its destination Lieutenant-Colonel C.\r\nW. Park, Devonshire regiment, who at that moment was senior officer\r\nat Lydenburg, learned that a small commando of about seventy Boers\r\nhad established itself in a valley near Krugerspost, twelve or\r\nfourteen miles north of the British camp. He determined to capture\r\nthe laager, and on the 13th of March issued orders for the night\r\nmarch by which the burghers were to be encircled and surprised.\r\nThe infantry selected for the enterprise were three companies of\r\nthe Rifle Brigade, three of the Devonshire, and the detachment of\r\nthe Royal Irish, now under command of Captain W. H. White, vice\r\nMajor Orr, who had been obliged to go into hospital. They were to\r\nbe carried in ox waggons for six miles; then after dismounting they\r\nwere to make a long sweep across the veld to avoid a Boer piquet, the\r\nposition of which had been ascertained, and on reaching a specified\r\npoint break into three small columns, and crown the hills commanding\r\nthe laager. The operation was by no means easy, for its success\r\ndemanded not only that the troops should accomplish the various\r\nstages of the march within the time allowed by the calculations of\r\nthe staff, but also that the guides should lead the detachments\r\nquickly and unerringly to the appointed places.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the column left the road its troubles began: the surface\r\nof the veld was seamed with spruits, pitted with bogs, and covered\r\nwith high grass; it was impossible to move in close formation, and\r\nonce the companies had been opened out, it became so difficult to\r\nmaintain connection between the various units that when the troops\r\nreached the spot where the encircling movement was to begin, they\r\nwere half an hour “behind scheduled time.” The Royal Irish detachment\r\nwas now handed over to a guide, who led it along a ravine which every\r\nmoment grew narrower and steeper. At first the man seemed confident\r\nin himself; then suddenly he lost his head, and confessed he was\r\ndoubtful about the exact position of the laager. The situation was\r\nserious, for if the Royal Irish did not succeed in making their way\r\nto the ground allotted to them in the scheme of attack, there would\r\nbe a gap in the enveloping line through which the Boers might easily\r\nescape. Captain White accordingly sent Lieutenant Panter-Downes with\r\nH company up the ravine with orders to push on and connect with the\r\nleft of the Devons, while he himself moved the remainder of the\r\ndetachment farther to the left to feel for the Rifle Brigade. Just\r\nas the first glimmer of dawn was showing in the east a message from\r\nPanter-Downes arrived to report that he had discovered the laager,\r\nwhich was not visible from the slope up which White was climbing.\r\nWhile F and G companies linked up with the Riflemen and gained a\r\ncrest commanding the Boer camp, H strove to get into touch with the\r\nDevons, but before Panter-Downes could make his way across a very\r\ndifficult piece of broken ground the Boers took the alarm, discovered\r\nthe gap in our line, and hurled themselves upon it, not without\r\nsuccess, for though they left thirty-seven of their number in our\r\nhands, the remainder of the commando escaped. Some of them owed their\r\nliberty to the chivalry of the Royal Irish; in the words of the\r\nRecord of Service they “would have been shot down had they not worn\r\nlong night-drawers and so been mistaken for women.” Though about half\r\nthe _personnel_ of the commando got away, all its _matériel_--tents,\r\nwaggons, horses, and much grain--fell into Colonel Park’s hands at a\r\ncost of only five casualties, all among the Royal Irish.[316]\r\n\r\nIn a few days the detachment returned to the railway and rejoined\r\nthe battalion, which now had been withdrawn from the garrison of\r\nBelfast to take part in active operations in the northern Transvaal.\r\nEarly in the year the Intelligence department had become aware\r\nthat the repeated attacks upon the railway were intended to divert\r\nattention from the preparations for a great raid to the southward,\r\nby which General Botha hoped to restore the shattered fortunes\r\nof the republican armies. Lord Kitchener, who on Lord Roberts’\r\ndeparture for England in December, 1900, had succeeded to the supreme\r\ncommand of the British forces in South Africa, first sent General\r\nFrench with 22,000 combatants to harry Botha’s commandos south of\r\nthe Pretoria-Delagoa Bay line, and then organised a body of nearly\r\n10,000 men with whom Lieutenant-General Sir B. Blood was to sweep\r\na huge piece of country, bounded on the south by the same railway,\r\non the north by the 25th degree of latitude, on the east by the\r\nStenkamps Berg, and on the west by the Oliphant river. The principal\r\nsettlement in this district was Roos Senekal, on which Blood’s\r\ntroops were to converge from various points. Three of the columns\r\nwere commanded by Major-General F. W. Kitchener, the remainder by\r\nMajor-General R. S. R. Fetherstonhaugh; the Royal Irish were allotted\r\nto that under the immediate orders of Colonel Park, who was one of\r\nKitchener’s subordinate commanders. Leaving the railway on March 27,\r\nthe battalion reached Lydenburg on April 11, where began six months\r\nof work as arduous, monotonous, and disagreeable as ever British\r\nsoldiers were called upon to perform. On some occasions the Royal\r\nIrish formed part of an outer ring of troops whose business it was\r\nto block every Nek and every drift by which a commando could break\r\nfrom the net that was closing upon it; at other times, as part of\r\nthe striking column, they made forced marches by day and night, too\r\noften to find that the burghers had taken the alarm and had fled,\r\nleaving behind them their womenkind, who they knew would be well\r\ntreated by the British. They had to “round-up” great mobs of cattle,\r\nto remove women and children from farms used as headquarters by the\r\nlocal guerillas, to escort convoys, and to march incessantly “in\r\na most difficult country over almost impossible roads.” For weeks\r\ntogether they never bivouacked twice in the same place, and whenever\r\nthey found themselves for a few days at Lydenburg or at a station\r\non the line, instead of resting, they had to build blockhouses. On\r\none of these brief visits to the comparative civilisation of the\r\nrailway the battalion was joined by Lieutenant W. G. Lindsey and\r\nthirty non-commissioned officers and men of the 5th (Irish volunteer\r\nbattalion), the King’s (Liverpool) regiment, who on May 20, 1901\r\narrived to replace the volunteer company which on October 8, 1900,\r\nhad started on its journey back to England.\r\n\r\nA detailed account of the work of the regiment between April and\r\nOctober, 1901, would contain so little beyond a list of bivouacs at\r\nplaces with uncouth and unknown names, that no attempt will be made\r\nto follow the wanderings of the Royal Irish: the reader who desires\r\nto know their exact position on every day throughout this period\r\nwill find the information in Appendix 8. At the end of September the\r\nbattalion, to use the South African expression, “came off trek,” and\r\nas soon as it had been refitted, relieved the Manchester regiment at\r\nLydenburg. An idea of the straits to which the men had been reduced\r\nby hard marching will be gathered from a report dated September 1:\r\n“many have no shirts at all, and others have no boots. All the boots\r\nand trousers are in a bad state and will not hold together much\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nColonel Park took the opportunity of thanking the officers and men\r\nfor their services in a farewell order dated October 1, 1901--\r\n\r\n  “It is with the greatest regret that the Officer Commanding the\r\n  column has now to part with the first battalion, the Royal Irish\r\n  regiment, the last remaining unit of the original force which\r\n  started from Lydenburg under his command five and a half months\r\n  ago.\r\n\r\n  “The splendid fighting qualities of the Royal Irish are well\r\n  known to all, and their magnificent marching powers and the good\r\n  spirit of all ranks under the hardships and privations of active\r\n  service have been the admiration of the O.C. column, and of all\r\n  ranks who have served with him. Colonel Park wishes them the best\r\n  of good luck, and trusts that at some future time he may have\r\n  again the honour of serving with this gallant and distinguished\r\n  regiment.”\r\n\r\nThough the war had already lasted for two years, the strenuous\r\nexertions of Botha, De Wet, and a few other Boer leaders prolonged\r\nthe struggle, hopeless though it was, for nine months longer. During\r\nthis time the battalion remained at Lydenburg, taking its share of\r\nduty in garrisoning the town, in escorting convoys, and in manning\r\nthe fifty-five blockhouses by which the place was linked with the\r\nrailway at Machadodorp, forty-five miles away. From the regimental\r\npoint of view only two incidents worthy of record occurred in this\r\nphase of the war: the capture of B. Viljoen, the Boer general who had\r\ninflicted so heavy a loss upon the Royal Irish at Monument Hill, and\r\nthe destruction by dynamite of a blockhouse held by a party of the\r\nRoyal Irish.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1902, Schalk Burger, the acting\r\nPresident of the Transvaal Republic, was in hiding near Dulstroom\r\nwith the few adherents who formed his so-called government. Viljoen,\r\nthe commander of the remnants of the commandos raised in the\r\ndistricts north of the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway, had been driven\r\nto Pilgrim’s Rest, whence Burger summoned him to a conference to\r\narrange for the transfer of the “government” to the comparative\r\nsafety of that remote settlement. The preliminaries being settled,\r\nViljoen preceded Burger on the journey over the fifty miles of\r\ncountry between Dulstroom and Pilgrim’s Rest. This ride, writes\r\nthe author of the Official History, “proved to be the last of the\r\nBoer leader’s many adventures. The British Intelligence Department\r\nwas keenly watching the vagrant legislature; and ambuscades lay in\r\nmany a likely spruit-bed and rail and river crossing. Into one of\r\nthese traps--laid by a party of the Royal Irish regiment, sent out\r\nunder Major A. S. Orr by Lieut.-Colonel H. Guinness--fell Viljoen\r\nas, having stolen past the outposts of Lydenburg, he made to ford\r\nthe Spekboom river.” The details of the capture were as follows: at\r\nabout 7 P.M. on January 25, 1902, Major Orr with five officers and a\r\nhundred and twenty of the other ranks was suddenly ordered to hasten\r\nto two drifts, where it was reported that a party of burghers would\r\nattempt to cross during the night.[317] Captain Farmer was sent with\r\na detachment to block one of these drifts; near the other Major\r\nOrr hid the remainder of his force, posting twenty men in a ruined\r\nfarmhouse a few hundred yards to his flank.\r\n\r\nBy 10 o’clock at night the trap was set, and the soldiers were\r\nresting after their long march over heavy mealie-fields and through\r\nspruits swollen by recent rain, when the detachment in the farm\r\nopened a sharp fusilade on a small number of Boers approaching\r\nfrom the south-west, and drove them towards the drift where Orr\r\nhad established himself. So perfectly in hand were the Royal Irish\r\nthat, though they could hear horses galloping towards them, they\r\nremained silent and motionless until the leading horsemen, who\r\nrode in pairs, were almost under the muzzles of their rifles. Then\r\nColour-Sergeant J. Boulger, who was nearest the road, shouted “Hands\r\nup.” Disregarding this summons the Boers galloped on: Boulger\r\nrealising that they meant to dash through the drift, opened fire on\r\nthe horses of the two Boers in front: his men followed his example,\r\nand the animals, one pierced by nine, the other by three bullets,\r\ndropped dead, in their fall pinning to the ground their riders,\r\nViljoen and Bester, one of the General’s staff. Then there was a\r\nshort confused skirmish, in which Nel, another of Viljoen’s staff,\r\nand a Cape Boer lost their lives; the remainder of the party, which\r\nnumbered ten in all, escaped, though not across the drift. As soon\r\nas Viljoen and Bester had been drawn from beneath their horses, they\r\nwere recognised by one of the civilian scouts, who told Major Orr the\r\nnames of the prisoners. Between men who have frequently faced each\r\nother in battle arises a curious feeling of quasi-friendship, and the\r\nRoyal Irish and the commandos led by Viljoen had frequently met on\r\nmany a hard-fought field: moreover, after Monument Hill Viljoen had\r\ntreated his prisoners, both officers and men, with great kindness:\r\ntherefore, as Orr hurried his captives to Lydenburg he assured them\r\nthat they had fallen into good hands, and during the few days that\r\nViljoen remained at Lydenburg awaiting an escort to the railway the\r\nregiment did its best to make his captivity agreeable. The burghers\r\nwere very anxious to rescue him; and one night, writes an officer,\r\n“two or three of them stole into the town to see if it was possible\r\nto dig him out, but finding a sentry at his door and another at his\r\nwindow gave up the attempt, leaving behind them a clever cartoon of\r\nLord Kitchener sitting in a zariba of barbed wire, surrounded by\r\nsurrendered burghers whom he was imploring to go out and persuade the\r\nothers to come in, while floating above him was the spirit of Joe\r\nChamberlain! The drawing was signed, ‘Phil Jung, with apologies to\r\nPhil May.’” In his report Colonel Guinness specially mentioned Major\r\nOrr, to whose good dispositions of the force at his command was due\r\nthe successful issue of the affair, and Colour-Sergeant Boulger,[318]\r\nwho had been very favourably reported upon by Major Orr.\r\n\r\nThe dynamite episode occurred two months later. Among the blockhouses\r\nheld by the Royal Irish was one, named by the troops Ben Tor, which\r\nstood on a kopje so thickly covered with big boulders that the\r\nsentries could not watch all the approaches to it. The building\r\nwas of stone, roofed with sheets of galvanised iron; and on the\r\nnight of the 18th of March it was held by a non-commissioned\r\nofficer--Sergeant M‘Grath--and nine private soldiers. About two\r\no’clock in the morning of the 19th, the two men on sentry outside\r\nthe blockhouse heard sounds which they rightly interpreted to be\r\nthose of approaching feet. While one remained on the look-out, the\r\nother crawled into the blockhouse and reported to Sergeant M‘Grath,\r\nwho immediately stood to arms and manned his loopholes, but almost\r\nbefore the men were in their places a bomb was hurled on the roof,\r\nwhich unfortunately being flat, not sloping, afforded the missile a\r\nsecure lodgment. In a second there was a tremendous explosion: the\r\nblockhouse was wrecked; one of the walls was thrown down, and every\r\nman of the garrison dangerously or severely wounded, except the\r\nsentry outside who escaped all injury. After capturing this man the\r\nBoers waited for some minutes to see if any one was still on foot;\r\nthen, satisfied that no resistance was to be expected, they rapidly\r\nlooted the blockhouse and decamped, fortunately without finding the\r\nboxes of reserve ammunition hidden under the sheets of galvanised\r\niron which formed the beds of the garrison. Beyond stripping some\r\nof the wounded, the burghers did their victims no harm, and sent\r\noff the uninjured soldier to summon medical aid from Lydenburg. By\r\ndawn a detachment of troops, a doctor, and an ambulance were on the\r\nway to Ben Tor, where, says one of the officers, “the place was\r\nlike a shambles--too horrible to describe.” As soon as the wounded\r\nmen had been removed,[319] the blockhouse was rebuilt and greatly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nNothing of note occurred in the battalion during the remainder of the\r\ncampaign, which was brought to an end by the declaration of peace\r\non May 31, 1902. This is not the place to discuss the terms upon\r\nwhich the Boer guerillas were allowed to surrender their arms and\r\nreturn to their homes; to enumerate the enormous sums spent by the\r\nImperial Treasury in rebuilding and restocking the burghers farms, or\r\nto speculate on what may be the ultimate effect on South Africa and\r\nthe Empire of the policy by which, little more than five years after\r\nthe last shot was fired in the war, all the rights and privileges\r\nof self-government were granted to our former enemies. Whatever the\r\nfuture may have in store for England, the Royal Irish regiment will\r\nalways have the satisfaction of remembering that throughout the long\r\nstruggle with the Boer republics, all ranks worthily maintained the\r\nhonour of their corps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doings of the officers and men who served in the mounted infantry\r\nare in no degree less interesting than those of the first battalion,\r\nbut, unfortunately, want of space renders it impossible to describe\r\nin detail the many engagements and operations of importance in which\r\nthey took part. All that can be attempted is a bare outline of their\r\nwork, with a few instances of the many exploits which the independent\r\nnature of their employment gave them the opportunity to perform.\r\nThough for a time the two contingents were in the same brigade, they\r\nwere employed together so seldom that their movements are chronicled\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nWhen the first battalion was called upon to provide a section for\r\nCaptain St Leger’s Cork company of the 1st regiment of mounted\r\ninfantry, commanded by Colonel E. A. H. Alderson, the choice fell\r\nupon Second Lieutenant P. U. Vigors and thirty-seven non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men, who landing at Cape Town early in November, 1899,\r\nwere sent up country to De Aar, a place important as a great railway\r\njunction and an advanced base, where large quantities of stores had\r\nbeen accumulated. Here they spent nearly three months, chiefly on\r\ndetached duties, such as guarding the railway bridge at Hanover\r\nRoad, outposts, and patrols, one of which once pushed out as far as\r\nPrieska in the north-west of Cape Colony. Early in February, 1900,\r\nthe 1st regiment of mounted infantry was allotted to the 1st brigade\r\nof mounted infantry, a newly-formed body under Colonel O. C. Hannay,\r\nand composed of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th regiments of mounted\r\ninfantry (all regular soldiers) and several corps of Australian and\r\nSouth African volunteers. In the 5th regiment the Royal Irish were\r\nwell represented; it was commanded by Major Hatchell, an officer of\r\nthe XVIIIth; and one company, or a quarter of its total strength, had\r\nbeen contributed by the first battalion.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish section of the Cork company of the 1st mounted\r\ninfantry charged with the cavalry at Klip Drift, and took part\r\nin the relief of Kimberley; reached Paardeberg some days before\r\nCronje surrendered, and shared in the actions of Poplar Grove and\r\nDriefontein. In the operations outside Bloemfontein on March 12, the\r\nCork company succeeded in forestalling the Boers in the occupation\r\nof an important kopje, just north of the Leper hospital. At the\r\ndisastrous affair at Sannah’s Post on the 31st of March, where the\r\nsection served in the rear-guard covering the retreat of our broken\r\nforce, all did well, and an officer and a lance-corporal especially\r\ndistinguished themselves. As Captain St Leger was superintending the\r\nretirement of the rear section of the Cork company he saw a big man,\r\ndismounted, running after the horsemen. St Leger called him, and\r\nascertained that he was Corporal Parker, 1st Life Guards, who after\r\nescaping from the trap in the Korn spruit had attached himself to the\r\nmounted infantry. While the corporal was speaking he was shot through\r\nthe right shoulder, and at that moment St Leger’s orderly, Drummer\r\nRadford, noticed that his officer was staying behind and rode back\r\nto him. Thinking he could manage the Life Guardsman alone, St Leger\r\nordered Radford to return to the company, but when he tried to get\r\nthe trooper on to his (St Leger’s) horse, failed to do so, for the\r\nman’s wound had made him incapable of helping himself, and he was too\r\nheavy to be lifted into the saddle. There was no time to be lost,\r\nso with his right arm round the trooper’s waist, he half supported,\r\nhalf dragged him in the direction in which the Cork company had\r\nretired. With his left hand St Leger led his horse, which grew very\r\nrestive under the pitiless hail of bullets that literally tore up the\r\nground under the animal’s belly. As the Boers followed up the little\r\ngroup, now completely isolated and a long way behind the last of the\r\nrear-guard, the outlook seemed almost hopeless. Suddenly St Leger\r\nrealised that if he could succeed in getting his wounded man a few\r\nhundred yards farther on, they would not only find temporary cover\r\nin some low-lying and broken ground, but would also be protected by\r\nthe fire of a party of Roberts’ Horse who, some distance off, were\r\nholding back the enemy on this part of the battlefield. The burghers\r\ncame on fast, and three of them galloped up to within a hundred\r\nyards of the fugitives, and emptied their magazines at them as they\r\ndisappeared into cover. As the Boers fired from the saddle none of\r\ntheir bullets took effect. Bad as the situation was, it grew worse\r\nwhen the section of Roberts’ Horse turned about, and galloped to a\r\nposition farther to the rear. Happily St Leger managed to attract\r\nthe attention of one of them--a gallant man, who raced back to him\r\nwith a led horse, on which they managed to hoist the Life Guardsman,\r\nwho, though faint from his wound, was still able to ride once he was\r\nin the saddle. Then they galloped hard, scattering in order to offer\r\na smaller target to the shower of Mauser bullets by which they were\r\npursued. Corporal Parker recovered from his wound completely; and\r\nneither the trooper in Roberts’ Horse nor Captain St Leger was hit;\r\nindeed, good luck followed the latter throughout the day, for thanks\r\nto the resolution of his groom, Private Ward, his favourite pony was\r\nsaved from the general wreck of the column. Private Ward was riding\r\nwith the waggons when they fell into the ambush; when called upon to\r\nsurrender, he refused to do so, and though his own horse was hit,\r\nsucceeded in escaping with St Leger’s pony, in whose saddle-bags were\r\nsixty sovereigns, just received for the men’s pay. Lance-Corporal\r\nHall distinguished himself by two acts of signal bravery under very\r\nheavy fire. Noticing a wounded gunner staggering along in the retreat\r\nhe rode back to him, and placed him upon his own horse: later in the\r\nday, when the Boers were pressing hard upon the mounted infantry, he\r\nsaw a trooper of Roberts’ Horse whose pony had been killed and who\r\nwas in imminent danger of being shot or captured. He dashed after a\r\nstray horse, caught it, and brought off the irregular in safety. Hall\r\nescaped unhurt; only three of the Royal Irish were wounded in this\r\nengagement.[320]\r\n\r\nThe section formed part of the army which invaded the Transvaal, and\r\nwas at the passage of the Reit and the Zand rivers, the action of\r\nJohannesburg, the capture of Pretoria, and the battle of Diamond Hill\r\n(11th and 12th of June). For the next few weeks it remained in the\r\nneighbourhood of Pretoria, chiefly engaged in outpost duty, sometimes\r\nof a very exciting nature. Thus at Reitvlei, on July 15, a piquet of\r\nsixteen men was saved from capture or destruction by the intelligence\r\nof Sergeant Connolly who, discovering that a party of two hundred\r\nburghers with three guns was threatening the post, reported so\r\nclearly and so promptly that his officer was able to signal for\r\nreinforcements, which fortunately arrived in time. When Lord Roberts\r\nbegan to advance towards Komati Poort the Cork company pushed on with\r\nthe remainder of the mounted infantry; a few of the Royal Irish\r\nsection were fortunate enough to be engaged at Bergendal, but none\r\nreached Komati Poort, the company remaining at Kaapsche Hoop until\r\nNovember, when it was ordered back to Pretoria and thence to the\r\nnorthern frontier of Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of June, De Wet had kept the Free State in a\r\nblaze, and although after his failure in various minor enterprises\r\nhe was chased up and down the country, and very roughly handled at\r\nBothaville on November 6, he rallied enough burghers around him to\r\nbe able to swoop upon the British garrison of Dewetsdorp, which\r\nsurrendered to him on the 23rd of November, 1900. The fall of this\r\nplace seemed to remove one of the chief obstacles to the raid into\r\nCape Colony which for months had been discussed round the camp fires\r\nof every Free State commando,[321] and De Wet pushed towards the\r\nOrange river, believing that once he gained its southern bank the\r\nDutch population in the colony would welcome him with enthusiasm.\r\nAs soon as his plan was discovered, troops were hurried from all\r\nparts of the theatre of war towards the Orange river, among them\r\nthe column to which the Cork company was attached. After a long and\r\nweary journey by train from Pretoria to Bethulie, it shared in the\r\noperations in December by which De Wet was prevented from crossing\r\nthe river, and driven backwards into the eastern Free State, where\r\nthough harried incessantly by our troops he never abandoned his\r\nscheme for a second invasion of British territory. The Cork company\r\nwas soon called away from the pursuit of De Wet to that of two of\r\nhis lieutenants, Kritzinger and Hertzog, who succeeded in passing\r\nacross the river and waged guerilla warfare in many districts of Cape\r\nColony. Early in February, 1901, De Wet, with extraordinary skill\r\nand equally extraordinary good fortune, threaded his way through\r\nthe troops closing round him, and dashed across the Orange at an\r\nunguarded drift, but there his lucky star failed him, and the British\r\nmounted troops, though almost spent by their unending pursuit of\r\nKritzinger and Hertzog’s raiders, who had now joined the commandos of\r\ntheir leader, drove the invaders back into the Free State at the end\r\nof February, 1901.\r\n\r\nBetween March and November 1901, the section was in the south of the\r\nFree State, occupied in clearing the country and similar uncongenial\r\nduties, the monotony of which was relieved by occasional skirmishes.\r\nIn one of these affairs two soldiers distinguished themselves.\r\nPrivate W. Sweeney found himself surrounded by four mounted Boers\r\nwho, covering him with their rifles, called upon him to surrender;\r\nthough they were all within fifty yards of him he refused to do so,\r\nand firing at them from the saddle succeeded in making his escape.\r\nHis name was specially mentioned to the General commanding the column\r\nfor his gallantry on this occasion.[322] Private Radford, while\r\ncarrying a message for Lieutenant Vigors, was wounded and his horse\r\nwas hit under him; nevertheless he delivered his message and then\r\nmade his way back to report that he had done so. The next two months\r\nwere spent at Winburg, and in January, 1902, the section began to\r\ntake part in the “drives” which marked the final phase of the war in\r\nthe north-east of the Free State. In addition to the non-commissioned\r\nofficer and men already mentioned, Lieutenant Vigors, in the\r\nstatement he prepared for the regimental records, gives praise to the\r\ngood conduct throughout the war of Sergeants Kennedy and Colthorpe,\r\nLance-Corporals Mackay and Griffin, Privates Tobin and (5914) Power.\r\n\r\nIt was said on page 311 that just before the battalion sailed\r\nfrom England Captain R. A. Smyth, Lieutenants S. H. L. Galbraith\r\nand E. Lloyd, with sixty-seven of the other ranks went to the\r\nmounted infantry at Shorncliffe. From this nucleus developed a\r\ncompany, composed of the same officers and a hundred and thirty-six\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men, who landed at Cape Town on\r\nJanuary 31, 1900, and formed part of the 5th regiment of mounted\r\ninfantry. The company received its baptism of fire on February 11,\r\n1900, while reinforcing the flank-guard of a convoy in difficulties\r\nbetween Ramah and Roodipan. In this affair Private M. Maher greatly\r\ndistinguished himself by volunteering to carry a written order to a\r\ndetachment, separated from the main body by a broad stretch of ground\r\ncompletely swept by the enemy’s fire. He set an excellent example by\r\nwalking, not running, across the danger zone; delivered the note,\r\nand then, refusing to remain with the detachment which was under\r\ncover, coolly returned to report that the order had duly reached\r\nthe officer to whom it was addressed. Maher was not hit; in this\r\naffair there were only two casualties among the Royal Irish, neither\r\nfatal.[323] The company was at a skirmish near Jacobsdal, where\r\nMajor Hatchell was wounded; and after a long night march arrived at\r\nKlip drift on the Modder river on the 15th, too late to take part\r\nin Lieutenant-General French’s charge through the Boer position,\r\nthough in time to see the cavalry division re-form and start on its\r\nfinal advance upon Kimberley. The Royal Irish were sent on outpost\r\nat once, and remained on piquet until dawn, when they were ordered\r\nto work eastward down the river to Klipkraal drift, one of the fords\r\nby which it was expected that Cronje, now in full retreat from the\r\nkopjes of Magersfontein, would attempt to cross the stream. The\r\ncompany was engaged all day with the Boer rear-guard, and several\r\nmen were wounded, among whom was Sergeant Peebles, whose experiences\r\nwere singularly unpleasant;[324] while on patrol he was shot through\r\nthe thighs, and falling helpless on the ground was stripped naked\r\nby marauding Boers, and left for dead, until late in the evening he\r\nwas rescued by a party of his comrades. After spending the night\r\nin guarding a battery of artillery, the company at daybreak on the\r\n17th was sent to ascertain if the burghers still held the ground\r\nthey had occupied when darkness put an end to the combat. As soon\r\nas the Royal Irish reported that the position had been evacuated,\r\nthe column was set in motion, but the Boers had gained a long start;\r\ntheir rear-guard again fought stoutly, and it was not until late in\r\nthe evening of the 17th that the mounted infantry bivouacked two\r\nmiles south of Paardeberg drift, near the laager which Cronje had\r\nformed a few hours sooner, when to his dismay he found that he had\r\nbeen “headed off” by French, who with a weak brigade of cavalry and\r\ntwo batteries of Royal Horse artillery from Kimberley had thrown\r\nhimself boldly across the Boer general’s path. At 4 A.M. on the\r\n18th, Hannay’s brigade marched eastwards to form the right of the\r\nline of troops with which Lord Kitchener proposed to attack the\r\nenemy’s position on every side. The Royal Irish company was engaged\r\nall day, and in the ill-fated charge led by Colonel Hannay against\r\nthe north-east face of the laager was represented by Captain Smyth,\r\nLieutenant Lloyd, and thirteen or fourteen non-commissioned officers\r\nand men, of whom several privates were wounded.[325] During the\r\nremainder of the operations, ending in Cronje’s surrender on February\r\n27, the company was employed in scouting and patrolling the country\r\nsouth-east of Paardeberg; and after taking part in the action of\r\nPoplar Grove it marched into Bloemfontein with Lieutenant-General\r\nTucker’s column on March 16th.\r\n\r\nDuring the next five weeks the 5th regiment of mounted infantry was\r\nnot employed in any important operation, but at the end of April it\r\njoined a force under Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton, which forced\r\nits way through the defile of Israel’s Poort, and after co-operating\r\nin driving the Boers from Thabanchu, marched northwards as right\r\nflank-guard to the main column in Lord Roberts’ advance from\r\nBloemfontein to the Transvaal. Between the 23rd of April, when the\r\nRoyal Irish company left Bloemfontein, and the 4th of June, when it\r\nentered Pretoria, there were few days when it was not under fire,\r\nand it was present at nearly all the actions in which the enemy was\r\ndriven from one fortified position after another. Considering how\r\nconstantly the company was engaged its casualties were not heavy:\r\nat Thabanchu, Captain Smyth and a private soldier were wounded; at\r\nWelkom, Private Murphy was killed by a shell, which striking him on\r\nthe back of the head, hurled him ten feet out of the saddle; and\r\nin a fight between Heilbron and Lindley on May 20, Lieutenant M. H.\r\nE. Welch and several men were wounded by the burghers, who after\r\ndriving in the rear-guard succeeded in getting between the main\r\ncolumn and the right flank-guard, of which the Royal Irish company\r\nformed part.[326] In this skirmish, where Britons and Boers were\r\nfighting in a confused mass, Captain Smyth had a narrow escape: he\r\nhad given up his horse to a wounded Royal Irishman when a mounted\r\nburgher tried to ride him down, but Smyth “dodged” the charge, and\r\nthen laid his enemy low by a well-aimed shot. Though the company was\r\nexposed to heavy artillery fire at the battle of Diamond Hill, none\r\nof the officers and men were hit; and the same good fortune attended\r\nthem for many weeks, for though as part of Hamilton’s (afterwards\r\nHunter’s) Force, the 5th M.I. fought their way from Heidelberg to\r\nthe Brandwater Basin, there were no casualties among them until July\r\n28, when at Naauwpoort Nek Corporal Hogan was blown to pieces by a\r\nshell, and a private soldier was wounded. After Prinsloo’s surrender\r\nthe company helped to escort two thousand prisoners to the railway,\r\nreaching Winburg on August 12, and in less than a fortnight was again\r\n“on trek,” this time in a column hurriedly despatched to the help of\r\na detachment which, while reconnoitring in the Doornberg range, a few\r\nmiles from Winburg, had been surrounded by a body of Boers five times\r\nits strength. This detachment, composed of South African volunteers\r\nand a handful of British militia, was hard pressed, and had lost\r\nnearly fifteen per cent of its numbers when the Boers retired on the\r\napproach of the relieving column. The only casualty among the Royal\r\nIrish was Captain Smyth, who was so severely hurt by a fall that\r\nhe was obliged to go into hospital. Captain Brush replaced him in\r\ncommand of the company, at that moment only about thirty strong, the\r\nremainder of the men being either in hospital or stranded in various\r\nparts of South Africa waiting for remounts.\r\n\r\nA few hours after the return of the troops to Winburg on the 27th\r\nof August, the town was attacked by the Boers, who finding it too\r\nstrong to take, drew off and sent a portion of their force against\r\nLadybrand. The 5th mounted infantry and all other available troops\r\nwere at once concentrated at Bloemfontein, and after relieving\r\nLadybrand hunted the commandos up and down the Orange Free State\r\nfor many weeks. As a rule the burghers succeeded in eluding their\r\npursuers, but on November 6, 1900, C. De Wet with a strong body\r\nof men was surprised near Bothaville by the 5th mounted infantry\r\nunder Major K. E. Lean, Royal Warwickshire regiment, who when Major\r\nHatchell was wounded at Jacobsdal had succeeded him in command. The\r\nfight began at dawn and lasted till midday, when the timely arrival\r\nof reinforcements broke down the enemy’s resistance; De Wet and\r\nthe greater part of his followers retired in confusion, leaving\r\nbehind them a detachment of brave men, who fought stubbornly until,\r\nthreatened by a charge of bayonets, they hoisted the white flag.\r\nOur spoils of war included a 12-pr. Horse Artillery gun, taken by\r\nthe Boers at Sannah’s Post, and one of the 15-prs. lost by us at\r\nColenso; four Krupps, a pom-pom, a machine gun, much artillery and\r\nrifle ammunition, many horses and carts, and a hundred and thirty\r\nprisoners. The Boers lost twenty-five men killed and thirty wounded;\r\nour casualties were thirteen killed and thirty-three wounded, among\r\nwhom were three of the Royal Irish.[327] Most of the company were\r\nhotly engaged on the right of the line throughout the action, often\r\nat very close range; while a few were attached to the guns, where\r\nthree privates of the Royal Irish greatly distinguished themselves.\r\nOne of the gun detachments was reduced to a single man, who served\r\nhis piece alone; while Privates Radigan and Maher by their steady and\r\nwell-aimed shooting kept back a party of the enemy who threatened to\r\ntake the gun in flank. In another part of the field Private Murphy\r\nwas conspicuous by his bravery in dragging a wounded officer from\r\nunder a deadly fire. Two or three days later Major-General Knox\r\nthanked the whole of the company for their services at Bothaville,\r\nand gave especial praise to these three men for their behaviour\r\nduring the fight.\r\n\r\nSoon after the 5th regiment of mounted infantry had refitted at\r\nKroonstad important news reached them: De Wet had recovered from\r\nhis losses at Bothaville, and had appeared in the south-east of the\r\nFree State, where he was attacking Dewetsdorp, whose defenders were\r\nhard pressed. The regiment was sent off by rail to Edenburg, where\r\nit joined the relieving column, which unfortunately did not arrive\r\nin time to prevent the surrender of the garrison. The company for\r\nthe next two months marched almost incessantly in the eastern half\r\nof the Free State, chasing De Wet, who, like the rainbow, was always\r\n“in the next field.” They had a couple of days’ rest at Christmas,\r\nwhen they bivouacked at a farm near Ficksburg, where, according to\r\nthe diary of one of the officers, “the only liquid available for\r\nour dinner was of so substantial a nature that a mugful evaporated\r\nwould leave enough solid matter to make a good-sized brick! We shared\r\nthe only dam in the place with the horses, mules, and oxen. Tea was\r\nan impossibility, and the coffee we swallowed with our eyes shut.”\r\nTowards the end of January, 1901, it was discovered that De Wet was\r\nsecretly concentrating his burghers for another attempt to raid into\r\nCape Colony. Many columns, including that in which the 5th M.I. were\r\nserving, were directed against him and caught up his rear-guard at\r\nthe Tabaksberg, where on the 29th of January the Boers fought a\r\ndelaying action, in the course of which a handful of the Royal Irish\r\nearned praise first for their dash in “rushing” a kopje, and then\r\nfor holding it against very heavy odds. The 5th were now ordered to\r\nBloemfontein, and after a slow railway journey detrained at Bethulie\r\nto take part in the movements by which De Wet and his guerilla bands\r\nwere to be expelled from Cape Colony. They were sent off to the\r\nnorth-west, and so hard was the marching that when the Royal Irish\r\ncompany reached Hopetown at the end of February, it had lost sixty\r\nout of the eighty horses it possessed a month before. In the course\r\nof the trek Private Maher again came to the fore by volunteering to\r\ncross a drift, in order to ascertain if the farther bank of the river\r\nwas occupied by the enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom Hopetown the company worked its way back to the east of the\r\nFree State, on one occasion bivouacking near Ramah, where it had\r\nsmelt powder for the first time, on another halting at Hout Nek,\r\nwhere under Hamilton it had fought at the beginning of May, 1900.\r\nDuring the remainder of the war the 5th regiment of mounted infantry\r\nwas chiefly employed in patrolling, escorting convoys, and clearing\r\nfarms, duties which entailed incessant and monotonous work. The\r\nprocess of clearing a farm of food and forage was by no means easy,\r\nespecially when it had to be done very quickly by a flank-guard under\r\nstringent orders to keep its proper place in the column. After a\r\nharassing day’s work, an officer in the regiment wrote in his diary\r\nthat “to tell a flank-guard to clear farms on its march is all very\r\nwell in theory, but when it comes to getting sacks of wheat or tons\r\nof loose mealies [_i.e._, Indian corn] out of a back room through\r\nseveral narrow doors or narrower windows, the flank-guard often finds\r\nitself left behind the rear-guard. Some people seem to think that in\r\nclearing a farm you have only to blow a whistle, and all the animals\r\ncommit suicide and all the grain jumps into the nearest dam.” It must\r\nnot be imagined that these duties were carried on unopposed. There\r\nwere frequent skirmishes; in one of these affairs (October 17, 1901)\r\na detachment of the Royal Irish company, finding itself surrounded by\r\nan overwhelming force of burghers in a place from which there was no\r\npossibility of fighting its way out, was compelled to lay down its\r\narms after the officer in command and three soldiers had been wounded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British losses in South Africa were by no means heavy,\r\nconsidering that the war lasted two years and eight months, and that\r\nduring a great part of the time more than a quarter of a million of\r\ntroops were in the field. The casualties were--\r\n\r\n                                     Officers |Other ranks.|  Total.\r\n                         (exclusive of staff).|            |\r\n  --------------------------------------------+------------+-------\r\n  Killed                                  518 |    5,256   |  5,774\r\n  Died of wounds, disease, or                 |            |\r\n      from accident                       554 |   15,614   | 16,168\r\n  Wounded                                1851 |   20,978   | 22,829\r\n\r\nThe casualties in the Royal Irish regiment were as follows:[328]--\r\n\r\n  Officers--\r\n\r\n    Killed            Captains S.

Apthorp, Captain E. F. Milner, Captain A. W. Brush,\r\n  Lieutenants S. H. L. Galbraith, P. U. Vigors, E. C. Lloyd, and H.\r\n  G. Gregorie (while serving in the Imperial Light Infantry before\r\n  he joined the Royal Irish regiment).\r\n\r\n  The Victoria Cross was awarded to No. 3733 Private John Barry.\r\n\r\n  The Distinguished Conduct Medal was awarded to the following\r\n  non-commissioned officers and men who were also mentioned in\r\n  despatches:--\r\n\r\n  _Sergeant-Major_ J. Bergin. _Sergeants_ J. O’Connor, H. Loney,\r\n  T. Connolly. _Lance-Corporals_ P. Doyle, E. Lovely, P. Dumphy,\r\n  W. Tytherleigh. _Privates_ T. Baker, W. Sweeney, M. Maher, J.\r\n  Murphy, J. Radigan.\r\n\r\n  Mentioned in Despatches--\r\n\r\n  _Colour-Sergeants_: T. Mahoney, J. Reddan, E. Murray.\r\n\r\n  _Sergeants_: H. Hall, T. McHale. _Lance-Sergeants_: C. Kennedy\r\n  and T.

Doyle was promoted to be\r\n  Corporal to reward his excellent behaviour at the action of\r\n  Slabbert’s Nek.\r\n\r\n  In the militia battalions affiliated to the Royal Irish the\r\n  following were mentioned in despatches:--\r\n\r\n  Captain C. Langford, 4th battalion, serving with Imperial\r\n  Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  Captain A. B. Crabbe, 5th battalion, with Imperial Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  Lance-Corporal J. Mahood, 5th battalion, while on railway patrol\r\n  on May 16, 1901, “was suddenly fired at by a party of Boers who\r\n  were mining the line. Though mortally wounded he continued to\r\n  fire as long as he could hold his rifle.”\r\n\r\nTo all who served in South Africa one, and in many cases two medals\r\nwere granted. Towards the end of 1900, it was believed officially\r\nin England that the war was virtually at an end, and a medal was\r\nstruck, bearing the effigy of Queen Victoria, for issue to those\r\nwho had taken part in the campaign. But after the war had dragged\r\non for more than a year longer, it was decided to prepare a second\r\nmedal with the effigy of King Edward VII., which was to be given\r\nto all who had served in the war for eighteen months and who had\r\nbeen in South Africa on January 1, 1902. Clasps were granted for\r\nvarious battles, sieges, and series of operations, and for service\r\nin certain specified areas during the years 1899-1900; and also for\r\nservice in any part of South Africa during the years 1901-1902. The\r\nbattle clasps obtained by the first battalion were for Wittebergen\r\n(_i.e._, Bethlehem, Slabbert’s Nek, Brandwater Basin), and Bergendal;\r\nthe Royal Irish section of the 1st mounted infantry received clasps\r\nfor the Relief of Kimberley, Paardeberg, Driefontein, Johannesburg,\r\nDiamond Hill, and Bergendal, and the Royal Irish company of the\r\n5th mounted infantry for the Relief of Kimberley, Paardeberg,\r\nJohannesburg, Diamond Hill, and Wittebergen.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the militia battalions of the regiment were embodied,\r\nand formed part of the garrison of the United Kingdom.[329]\r\n\r\nIn memory of the members of the regular or militia battalions who\r\ndied in South Africa two memorials have been erected, one in St\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral, the other in the barracks at Clonmel. Both are\r\ndescribed in Appendix 10.\r\n\r\nIt has been decided that this history should end with the close of\r\nthe South African war, and therefore nothing will be said about the\r\ndoings of the regiment since May, 1902. And indeed, a detailed record\r\nwould show little beyond that unceasing training for active service\r\nfor which the army and the nation have to thank the campaign in\r\nSouth Africa. During this period there have been only two incidents\r\nof note. In December, 1905, the first battalion had the honour\r\nof sending three officers and a hundred men to guard His Majesty\r\nGeorge V. when, during his tour in India as Prince of Wales, he was\r\nencamped at Kala-Ki-Serai. Three years later the same battalion was\r\nmobilized for active service in the expedition against the Mohmands\r\non the north-west frontier of India; but unfortunately for the Royal\r\nIrish, this hill campaign was brought to so speedy and successful a\r\nconclusion that they were not called up to the front.\r\n\r\nDuring the two hundred and twenty-seven years of its existence\r\nthe XVIIIth regiment has served in nearly all the important wars\r\nin which England has been engaged, and has earned undying laurels\r\nwhenever it has had an opportunity of distinguishing itself. The\r\nroll of battle honours, long as it is, by no means commemorates all\r\nthe achievements of the regiment: in the Low Countries the Royal\r\nIrish took a leading part in the storming, not only of Namur, but of\r\nmany other fortresses; in the capture of the Schellenberg, in the\r\nengagement at Bunker’s Hill, in the defence of Toulon, and in the\r\nfighting in Corsica the regiment won great praise, but the names of\r\nnone of these operations are emblazoned on its Colours. Early in its\r\ncareer, the regiment earned the reputation of being second to none in\r\nthe British army. This reputation it has maintained to the present\r\nday; and the author is convinced that when in years to come, his\r\nsuccessor writes the continuation of this history, it will be seen\r\nthat the future generations of officers and men of the Royal Irish\r\nregiment have carried on the glorious traditions of the XVIIIth, and\r\nhave rivalled, though they could not surpass the brilliant feats of\r\narms which have been described in these pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR MONUMENT AT CLONMEL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 1.\r\n\r\n  THE MOVEMENTS OF THE XVIIITH ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT FROM THE TIME\r\n  OF ITS FORMATION IN 1684 TO THE END OF THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA IN\r\n  1902, AND THE PLACES WHERE IT HAS BEEN QUARTERED IN TIME OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1685              Sailed for England; quartered at Chester, and then\r\n                        returned to Ireland.\r\n  1687              At the Curragh during the summer.\r\n  1688              At the Curragh during the summer: then sailed for\r\n                        England, and marched to London, thence to\r\n                        Salisbury; returned to Colnbrook near London,\r\n                        and in the winter quartered in Hertfordshire.\r\n  1689.

These latter, supposed to be\r\nsickly or weakly men, averaged twenty-two miles a day for six days.\r\n‘B’ Company under Captain King, on one occasion marched seventeen\r\nmiles to meet and escort back artillery; thirty men, under Lieutenant\r\nPotter, volunteered, after three hours’ rest to march back as\r\nescort, which they did, the remainder following a few hours later,\r\nthirty-four miles in one day.\r\n\r\n“On September 9th ‘A’ and ‘C’ companies from Hangu, with three native\r\nbattalions, marched to Fort Lockhart, escorting a convoy, and in the\r\nreturn march were successfully engaged with the enemy on Gogra Hill.\r\n\r\n“On September 12th the headquarters, 295 strong, took part in the\r\nrelief of Gulistan, on which occasion three actions were fought\r\nbetween Hangu and that fort, at Gogra, Saragari, and Gulistan, the\r\nenemy being cleared off the Samana Ridge.\r\n\r\n“The headquarters remained at Fort Lockhart awaiting the further\r\nadvance. No hint that the regiment was to be sent back reached\r\nthe ears of any one belonging to it until the day on which it was\r\npublished in orders.\r\n\r\n“As soon as he heard of it, the Commanding Officer and\r\nSecond-in-command at once interviewed the General, who informed them\r\nthat the reason of the recall was ‘that the regiment was saturated\r\nwith malarial fever.’\r\n\r\n“The Commanding Officer, well knowing that at the time sickness had\r\nalmost entirely disappeared, asked for a medical board, the result\r\nbeing that the board passed 523 men as absolutely fit, and above the\r\naverage in physique. Thirty only were rejected at Fort Lockhart; most\r\nof the remainder were at Kohat and Hangu and were not examined.\r\n\r\n“Every effort was made to get the order cancelled, but without avail.\r\nThe battalion marched into Rawal Pindi over 700 strong.\r\n\r\n“A court of enquiry was applied for, and refused.\r\n\r\n“In the end the battalion was ordered back to the front, but too late\r\nto take part in any further important operations. It thus lost the\r\nchance of adding fresh laurels to its name, through no fault of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“It was not long before certain libellous newspaper writers, eager\r\nfor scandal, commenced their attacks on the fair fame of the\r\nregiment, but no one who knows the material of which it consisted,\r\nmen from the counties of Wexford, Tipperary, Kilkenny, and Waterford,\r\never for a moment gave credence to their tales.\r\n\r\n“No steps have been left untaken to have this great wrong righted.\r\nHis lordship, the Commander-in-Chief has given the above decision,\r\nand every man who wears or who has ever worn the uniform of the Royal\r\nIrish owes a debt of gratitude to his lordship which can never be\r\nsufficiently repaid for the trouble he has taken in our cause.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Lawrence would like to make it known to the battalions here\r\nat Kilworth that he never heard or heard of, a complaint from any one\r\nduring these operations, though the heat, hard work, and long marches\r\nwere particularly trying. On the contrary, the men were conspicuous\r\nfor cheery willingness and good temper, and their eager keenness to\r\nmeet the enemy.\r\n\r\n  “CAMP, KILWORTH, _June 8th, 1898_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 6.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER’S KIT IN SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from Regimental Orders of 4th of January 1900--\r\n\r\n  s.s. _Gascon_.\r\n\r\n“The valise equipment will be drawn to-morrow.

All officers and men travelling by train on all occasions must\r\n  be armed.\r\n\r\n  2. The senior officer travelling on a train is responsible for\r\n  its defence, if attacked.\r\n\r\n  3. For this purpose every officer travelling should satisfy\r\n  himself whether he is the senior officer on the train or not.\r\n\r\n  4. The senior officer on the train should see that the men\r\n  travelling by the train have their rifles handy, and that one or\r\n  two men are detailed to keep a look-out.\r\n\r\n  5. It has lately been noticed that the enemy, when they attempt\r\n  the capture of a train, ride up behind the train when it is going\r\n  slowly up a grade, and detach the vacuum hose from the rear of\r\n  the brake-van. They then open fire along both sides of the train,\r\n  to prevent any one getting out.\r\n\r\n  6. To avoid this, a truck is attached to the rear of each train,\r\n  with the vacuum hose disconnected. If any troops are travelling\r\n  on the train, the senior officer should see that some of them are\r\n  posted, if possible, on the rear truck.\r\n\r\n  7. Engine drivers have instructions to blow a long blast on the\r\n  base whistle, if they have any reason to think that anything is\r\n  wrong. Troops should be instructed to stand to arms on hearing\r\n  this warning.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn orders of February 22, 1901, appeared the following instructions\r\nfor officers and men travelling by train.\r\n\r\n  “1. A commander is to be detailed in each truck in which there\r\n  are troops.\r\n\r\n  2. Officers travelling with troops are to be distributed\r\n  throughout the train: they are not all to travel together in one\r\n  truck.\r\n\r\n  3. The men are to keep their ammunition on, and their rifles\r\n  beside them. The rifles are not to be stacked in a corner of the\r\n  truck.\r\n\r\n  4. The men in the rear truck are to be mounted as a guard with a\r\n  sentry, and magazines charged.\r\n\r\n  5. The officer in command of the train should enquire of the\r\n  Commandant or R.S.O. which are the most dangerous parts of the\r\n  line and warn all under his command.\r\n\r\n  6. Goods and bales on the trucks are to be arranged as\r\n  breastworks as far as possible, in the rear truck especially.\r\n\r\n  7. R.S.O.’s are to arrange that these orders are shown to the\r\n  Commander of every train. When small parties without an officer\r\n  or N.C.O. are on the train, he should appoint one man in charge.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 8.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE NORTH OF THE TRANSVAAL.\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE “RECORD OF SERVICE,” FROM APRIL 12, 1901, TO\r\nSEPTEMBER 30, 1901, SHOWING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FIRST BATTALION DAY\r\nBY DAY DURING THIS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n      1901.\r\n\r\n  12th April  Came under command of Colonel Park forming part of Park’s\r\n  13th  ”       column together with 1/ Gordon Highlanders, 53rd Battery,\r\n                Royal Field Artillery, 4th M.I., one Company 4th\r\n                Divisional M.I.

The prize which\r\nLord Wolseley offered to the Battalion which made the fastest passage\r\nup the Nile was won by the 1st Battalion of the 18th Royal Irish.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Soudan, Viscount Wolseley resumed his post of\r\nAdjutant-General to the Forces, which he held until 1890, when he\r\nwas appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland. He was\r\npromoted to be Field-Marshal on the 26th of May, 1894.

Arthur Forbes, Earl of Granard.\r\n\r\nArthur Forbes, the eldest son of Sir Arthur Forbes, Bart., of Castle\r\nForbes, Co. Longford, was born in 1623, and was a cavalry officer\r\nin the Royal Army during the rebellion in the reign of King Charles\r\nI. He attained the rank of Colonel in 1646, and held a command in\r\nScotland under Montrose. Having zealously espoused the royal cause,\r\nhe was, after the Restoration sworn a member of the Privy Council\r\nand appointed Marshal of the Army in Ireland. He was raised to the\r\npeerage of Ireland by patent, dated 22nd of November, 1675, as Baron\r\nClanehugh and Viscount Granard. In 1684, the independent companies of\r\nfoot in Ireland were formed into seven infantry regiments, and the\r\nColonelcy of one of these corps was conferred upon Viscount Granard,\r\nwho was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General. Lord Granard’s\r\nregiment, afterwards the 18th Royal Irish, and now The Royal Irish\r\nRegiment, is the only one of the regiments then formed which has\r\ncontinued in the service of the British crown. In December, 1684,\r\nViscount Granard was created Earl of Granard. In 1686, he resigned\r\nthe Colonelcy of his regiment in favour of his son, Arthur, Lord\r\nForbes.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Arthur, Lord Forbes.\r\n\r\nLord Forbes served under Marshal Turenne, and took part in the battle\r\nof Saspach. He was present at the siege of Buda. He obtained the\r\ncommand of Lord Granard’s regiment on the 1st of March, 1686, and\r\ncommanded it when it came to England at the time of the Revolution\r\nin 1688. The regiment marched from Chester to London, where it was\r\nquartered in the borough of Southwark. Soon after the abdication of\r\nKing James II., Lord Forbes retired from the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Colonel Sir John Edgworth.\r\n\r\nThis officer was Captain of one of the independent companies of\r\npikemen and musketeers in Ireland, and was promoted to be Major of\r\nthe Earl of Granard’s regiment.

Edward Brabazon was originally Captain of one of the Irish\r\nindependent companies. In 1684, he succeeded, on the death of his\r\nbrother, to the dignity of Earl of Meath. He joined the Prince of\r\nOrange at the Revolution of 1688, and, in the following year, was\r\nappointed to the Colonelcy vacated by Sir John Edgworth. The regiment\r\nbeing selected for service in Ireland with Duke Schomberg’s army,\r\nhe commanded it at the siege of Carrickfergus and at the battle of\r\nthe Boyne. He showed great gallantry at the siege of Limerick, where\r\nhe was wounded. At the close of the campaign in Ireland the Earl of\r\nMeath retired from the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Major-General Frederick Hamilton.\r\n\r\nFrederick Hamilton commenced his military career in one of the\r\ncompanies of pikemen and musketeers which were incorporated in\r\nLord Mountjoy’s regiment.

In\r\n1692, he succeeded the Earl of Meath in the Colonelcy. He commanded\r\nthe regiment throughout the campaign of King William III. in\r\nFlanders, and was wounded at the memorable assault upon the castle of\r\nNamur. In 1702, Colonel Hamilton was promoted to be Brigadier-General\r\nin the Duke of Marlborough’s army, and his brigade, which included\r\nhis own regiment, was engaged at the sieges of Venloo, Ruremonde, and\r\nLiege. Brigadier-General Hamilton again commanded a brigade during\r\nthe campaigns of 1703 and 1704, and, as a Major-General, he took part\r\nin the battles of Schellenberg and Blenheim. In 1705, he received\r\nQueen Anne’s permission to sell the Colonelcy of his regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.

On the outbreak\r\nof war in 1701, he was sent to Holland with a command in the Duke of\r\nMarlborough’s army, and highly distinguished himself during several\r\ncampaigns. As a Lieutenant-General he was present at the battles\r\nof Schellenberg and Blenheim. On the 1st of April, 1705, General\r\nIngoldsby was appointed Colonel of the 18th Royal Irish, and was\r\nafterwards nominated one of Her Majesty’s Lords Justices, and Master\r\nof the Horse for Ireland. He died on the 29th of January, 1712.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Brigadier-General Robert Stearne.\r\n\r\nRobert Stearne belonged to one of the independent companies in\r\nIreland that were incorporated into Lord Granard’s Regiment in\r\n1684. His journal, which relates the stirring events in which he\r\nparticipated with the regiment from 1684 to 1717, is now one of\r\nthe most valued possessions of The Royal Irish. He accompanied the\r\nregiment to England at the Revolution in 1688, and became Captain of\r\nhis company in the following year. At the close of King William’s\r\ncampaign in Ireland he was promoted to be Major. He served in the\r\nFlanders campaigns of 1695 and 1696. At the storming of Namur,\r\nwhere the regiment so greatly distinguished itself and acquired\r\nthe title of The Royal Regiment of Ireland, Lieut.-Colonel Ormsby\r\nwas killed, and Major Stearne was promoted by King William to the\r\nlieut.-colonelcy. He served in the Netherlands and Germany throughout\r\nthe whole of the wars of Queen Anne’s reign, and commanded the\r\nregiment at the battles of Schellenberg, Blenheim, Ramillies,\r\nOudenarde, and Malplaquet; also in numerous sieges and engagements.\r\nColonel Stearne became Brigadier-General in 1711, and in 1712 he was\r\nrewarded with the Colonelcy of his regiment, and was also appointed\r\nGovernor of the Royal Hospital at Dublin. He concludes his journal\r\nin the following words: “In the month of May, 1717, the regiment\r\nreceived orders to march to Portsmouth, and there I take my leave of\r\nthem, for, in the month of January following, His Majesty gave me\r\nleave to resign my regiment to Colonel William Cosby, after having\r\nserved six crowned heads of England, and been forty years attached\r\nto one company without ever being removed from it; having made\r\ntwenty-one campaigns; having been in seven field-battles--fifteen\r\nsieges--seven grand attacks on counterscarps and breaches--two\r\nremarkable retreats--at the passing of four of the enemy’s\r\nlines--besides several other petty actions; and, through God’s\r\nassistance, never had one drop of blood drawn from me in all those\r\nactions.” Brigadier-General Stearne died on the 1st of November, 1732.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Brigadier-General William Cosby.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cosby served for many years as an officer of the Life Guards,\r\nand rose to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. He was promoted to the\r\nColonelcy of the 18th Royal Irish in December, 1717, and accompanied\r\nthe regiment to Minorca. He commanded a detachment of the troops\r\nsent from that island to Gibraltar, when the Spaniards besieged the\r\nfortress in 1727. Colonel Cosby was afterwards appointed Governor\r\nof the Leeward Islands, and, in 1732, he became Captain-General and\r\nGovernor-in-Chief of New York and New Jersey, when he relinquished\r\nthe Colonelcy of his regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.

The figure in the\r\ncentre represents King Cormac of Cashel--bishop, warrior, and scribe.\r\nMiss Purser writes: “He is standing leaning on his sword, with his\r\nwarriors behind him; one holds his shield, and another a banner with\r\na dragon of an interlacing Celtic design. At the top of the window\r\ntwo angels support his mitre. In a panel at the base, a mourning\r\nangel leans over a shield bearing a badge of the Regiment--the Lion\r\nof Nassau. On a scroll is the Regimental motto--‘Virtutis Namurcensis\r\nPræmium’--and the Harp and Crown; the Sphinx and the Dragon are also\r\nworked into the ornament.”\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the window is inscribed on the glass:--\r\n\r\n  IN MEMORY OF THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND MEN\r\n  OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT WHO FELL IN THE\r\n  SOUTH AFRICAN WAR, 1899-1902.\r\n\r\nAs the Depôt of the Regiment is at Clonmel, in the diocese of Cashel,\r\nthe choice of the subject of the window is very appropriate, and Miss\r\nPurser has been most successful in introducing the various regimental\r\ndevices into the design; the jewel-like colours of the glass are also\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CRIMEAN WINDOW.\r\n\r\nThis is just visible in the picture to the right of the South African\r\nWindow. It is a lancet; at the top is the Harp and Crown, with wreath\r\nof shamrocks, and a scroll bearing the regimental motto. In the\r\ncentre is a view of Sebastopol Harbour, and at the base an ornamental\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nOn a scroll below the window is the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  THIS MEMORIAL WINDOW\r\n  WAS ERECTED\r\n  TO THE MEMORY OF THOSE OF THE\r\n  18TH (ROYAL IRISH) REGIMENT\r\n  WHO FELL IN THE CRIMEA\r\n  1855-56.\r\n\r\n  KILLED OR DIED OF THEIR WOUNDS--\r\n  LIEUT.

III. XI.\r\n\r\n(The tablet bears the private Crest of Major Armstrong and the\r\nRegimental Crest and Motto.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll connected with the Regiment, both in the past and the present,\r\nwho may not have visited St Patrick’s Cathedral in recent years,\r\nwill be struck by the vast improvement lately effected through the\r\nrearrangement and artistic grouping of the numerous Regimental\r\nMemorials.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject, Sir Thomas Drew wrote on August 20th, 1907: “The\r\nreal Memorial work was the collection of the previous Memorials of\r\nthe Regiment, which were casual and scattered, and rearranging them\r\nwith some general regard into a trophy in which the older Burmah and\r\nChina monuments of the Pagan and Early Victorian Era were grouped\r\nwith the dominant South African Votive Cross. They lent themselves, I\r\nthought, very happily to component parts of one Regimental Memorial\r\nof historic interest, to which the North Transept of the Cathedral\r\nis dedicated now. As a whole, and properly photographed, I could\r\nconceive no more effective frontispiece to a book on the Royal Irish\r\nRegiment.”\r\n\r\nThe Very Reverend The Dean of St Patrick’s, in the course of his\r\nspeech at the ceremony of the unveiling of the South African\r\nMemorial, said: “It is the privilege of the Chapter of the National\r\nCathedral to be the guardians of many memorials of distinguished\r\nIrish regiments. But with no regiment are our ties so manifold and\r\nso intimate as with the famous regiment which offers us to-day the\r\ncustody of its Memorial of the comrades who fell in South Africa. We\r\nare surrounded at this end of the North Transept by your insignia\r\nand the memorials of your past. In this place, hallowed by so many\r\nmemories of gallant men, it is fitting that you should offer, and\r\nthat we should welcome, a monument which will recall to future\r\ngenerations the services which the 1st Battalion of the 18th Royal\r\nIrish--the Royal Regiment of Ireland--rendered with faithfulness\r\nand devotion for two years and a half during the last great trial\r\nof our arms, the long death-roll--too long to inscribe on our walls\r\nhere--shows at how great a cost your duty was fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT AT CLONMEL.\r\n\r\nThese consist of--\r\n\r\n  I. A Memorial Cross commemorative of the Campaigns in Afghanistan,\r\n     1879-80; Egypt, 1882; and the Nile Expedition, 1884-85.\r\n\r\n  II. A Monument commemorative of the South African War, 1899-1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFGHANISTAN AND EGYPT CROSS.\r\n\r\nThis Memorial is placed in the Barrack Square at Clonmel, where the\r\nDepôt of the Regiment is stationed. The design is that of an old\r\nCeltic Cross adapted from one in Co. Sligo. It is executed in red\r\nAberdeen granite, the height is 7 feet 6 inches, width 2 feet 9\r\ninches, and mounted on a base 2 feet 6 inches high. The designers\r\nand executants of the work are Messrs H. Sibthorpe & Son, of 33\r\nMolesworth Street, Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the North face of the Cross is--\r\n\r\n  IN MEMORY OF THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND PRIVATE\r\n  SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST AND 2ND BATTALIONS OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT,\r\n  WHO DIED OF DISEASE OR WERE KILLED IN ACTION DURING THE CAMPAIGNS\r\n  OF AFGHANISTAN, 1879-80, AND EGYPT, 1882.\r\n\r\n              THIS MEMORIAL IS ERECTED BY THEIR COMRADES.\r\n              ALSO IN MEMORY OF NILE EXPEDITION, 1884-85.\r\n\r\nThe names inscribed on the East, West, and South faces are given in\r\nAppendix 2.\r\n\r\nThere was no public ceremony at the unveiling of this Memorial.\r\n\r\nA picture of the Cross is at page 231.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR MEMORIAL, CLONMEL.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of unveiling this Memorial was performed at the\r\nBarracks, Clonmel, on October 5th, 1908, by the Marquis of Ormonde,\r\nHonorary Colonel of the original 5th Battalion, now the 4th Special\r\nReserve Battalion, of the Royal Irish Regiment. About 350 men of the\r\n2nd Battalion, under command of Colonel A. S. Orr, D.S.O., travelled\r\nfrom Buttevant with the band and colours, and formed up on the\r\nBarrack Square with the 3rd Special Reserve Battalion, under command\r\nof Major R. O. Kellett.\r\n\r\nAfter carrying out the ceremony of unveiling, the Marquis of Ormonde\r\naddressed the troops, and recounted the services of the Regiment\r\nduring the War in South Africa. He made special mention of the\r\ngallant deed of No. 3733, Private J. Barry, a Kilkenny man, who was\r\nkilled at Monument Hill on the night of January 6th, 1901. Private\r\nBarry was awarded the Victoria Cross, and it was given to his widow.\r\nLord Ormonde further alluded to the fine fighting record of the Royal\r\nIrish in all parts of the British Empire during two and a quarter\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nColonel A. S. Orr, D.S.O., responded on behalf of the Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n_Designer_--R. CAULFEILD ORPEN, Esq., B.A., F.R.I.A.I., 13 South\r\nFrederick Street, Dublin.\r\n\r\n_Executants_--Messrs C. W. HARRISON & SONS, 178 Great Brunswick\r\nStreet, Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial consists of three stone seats, forming a triangle, set\r\non a circular platform, reached by three broad circular steps. Above\r\nthe backs of the seats, and filling the space which they enclose,\r\nrises a triangular block of masonry having sunk panels on each of its\r\nfaces, the whole being surmounted by a carved stone cornice.\r\n\r\nThe work is executed throughout in fine selected Irish limestone from\r\nthe Stradbally quarries.\r\n\r\nThe height of the entire structure is fifteen feet, and the sides of\r\nthe triangle are eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe front panel on the triangle bears a female figure executed in\r\nbronze in relief. The figure was designed and modelled by Miss\r\nBeatrice Elvery, of Dublin, who also made the models for the bronze\r\nwreaths and escutcheons which surround the Memorial immediately\r\nbelow the carved stone cornice; the escutcheons show the regimental\r\nbadges. The two side panels on the triangle, which correspond in\r\nsize with the front panel, are filled with the roll of Officers,\r\nNon-Commissioned Officers, and Men who fell in the Campaign.\r\n\r\nOn the panels behind the three seats the following inscriptions are\r\nplaced:--\r\n\r\nFront--\r\n\r\n  SOUTH AFRICA, 1899-1902. TO THE MEMORY OF THE OFFICERS,\r\n  NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND MEN OF THE ROYAL IRISH\r\n  REGIMENT WHO WERE KILLED IN ACTION AND DIED OF WOUNDS\r\n  OR DISEASE DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nOn the Right Side--\r\n\r\n  1899-1900.

When they captured a European ship, the\r\ncrew and passengers were carried off to Algiers and sold as slaves;\r\nif there were women on board, they were bought for the _harems_ of\r\nrich Moors. In 1816 England sent a great fleet to Algiers and after\r\na very heavy bombardment, effectually crippled the sea-power of its\r\nfreebooting population.\r\n\r\n[26] In 1745 the XVIIIth had a somewhat similar experience at Mons.\r\nSee p. 77.\r\n\r\n[27] Millner.\r\n\r\n[28] The engagement took place virtually on the same ground as the\r\nbattle of Blenheim in 1704. French military writers always speak of\r\nthe second battle as Hochstädt, which is confusing to the English\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n[29] From Parker we learn that the troops used to march off at 3\r\nA.M.; about 9 they reached their camping ground, where “all manner\r\nof necessaries for man and horse awaited them, so that the soldiers\r\nhad nothing to do but to pitch their tents, boil their kettles and\r\nlie down to rest.” This admirable system, carefully organised by\r\nMarlborough, whose care for his soldiers astonished his foreign\r\ncolleagues, naturally came to an end after the army had passed out of\r\nthe territories of the Allied Powers: once in the enemy’s country the\r\nBritish troops had to face many hardships.\r\n\r\n[30] The regimental historians do not mention the strength of the\r\ndetachment. Mr Fortescue states that the battalions on this occasion\r\nwere made up of contingents of 130 officers and men from each British\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n[31] These were a battalion of the Guards, Royal Scots, and 23rd.\r\n\r\n[32] ‘The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner,’ by M. de la Colonie\r\n(translated by Lieut.-Colonel W. C. Horsley), p. 185.\r\n\r\n[33] The British losses given by Millner are practically the same as\r\nthose adopted by Mr Fortescue (vol. i. p. 427).

During the great war with France we had in our pay\r\nbattalions composed of subjects of every country into which Napoleon\r\nhad carried his arms. The Emperor had drafted them into his\r\nregiments, and when they were taken prisoners they usually preferred\r\nto earn pay by enlisting in our army to languishing at Dartmoor or in\r\nthe hulks. Not unnaturally they showed, as a rule, no great anxiety\r\nto meet their former comrades in battle, and usually found their way\r\nto the West Indies as garrison troops.\r\n\r\n[37] Some French historians, while they admit Tallard’s folly in\r\ndisregarding the opinion of his colleagues, deny that he used the\r\nexpression attributed to him by Parker, and father it upon St Ruth at\r\nAughrim.\r\n\r\n[38]\r\n               (Table--First Part.)\r\n  -------------------+------+------+---------+---------+--------+---------\r\n                     |No. of|No. of|         | Lieut-  |        |\r\n                     |Battalions.  |         | enant-  |        |\r\n          Corps.     |   Squadrons.|Colonels.|Colonels.|Majors. |Captains.\r\n  -------------------+------+------+----+----+----+----+---+----+----+----\r\n  Britains           |      |      | K. | W. | K. | W. | K.| W. | K. | W.\r\n   Foot              |  14  |  --  |  1 |  2 |  3 | 4  | 1 |  6 | 17 | 44\r\n   Horse and Dragoons|  --  |  18  | -- | -- |  1 | -- | 2 |  1 |  1 |  3\r\n                     +------+------+----+----+----+----+---+----+----+----\r\n            Total    |  14  |  18  |  1 |  2 |  4 | 4  | 3 |  7 | 18 | 47\r\n                     |      |      +----+----+----+----+---+----+----+----\r\n  Other Allies.      |      |      |\r\n   Holland’s         |  14  |  19  |\r\n   Lunenberg’s       |  13  |  25  |\r\n   Wirtemberg’s*     |   7  |  12  |\r\n   Danes             |  --  |  22  |\r\n   Germans**         |  18  |  92  |\r\n    (11 batts.

Reference to map No. 1 will enable the reader to follow the\r\nletterpress without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[49] In this cavalry affair the electoral Prince of Hanover,\r\nafterwards George II., in charging at the head of a squadron, had a\r\nhorse shot under him. His rival, the Pretender, served at this battle\r\nin the French army.\r\n\r\n[50] During the night a large number of French soldiers lost their\r\nbearings and strayed into the lines of the Allies. Eugene caught\r\nmany of them by ordering the drummers to beat the French “retraite,”\r\nwhile Huguenot officers shouted out the rallying cries of various\r\nregiments. The unlucky soldiers who answered to the call were pounced\r\nupon, disarmed, and marched to the rear.\r\n\r\n[51] See Appendix 2 (B).\r\n\r\n[52] The Duke of Berwick was a natural son of James II.; he was in\r\nthe service of France, and greatly distinguished himself at the\r\nbattle of Almanza in Spain by defeating an army of the Allies, in\r\nwhich were a considerable number of British troops. Almanza has\r\ncurious points of likeness to Fontenoy, for in both battles the\r\nBritish won a great local success, but being unsupported by their\r\nAllies were defeated at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n[53] Fortescue, vol. i. p. 504.\r\n\r\n[54] Millner remarks drily that after the French had flooded the\r\ncountry they thought “they had our Army in a Pound, but searching\r\ninto the depths thereof they at last found themselves most snared\r\ntherein.”\r\n\r\n[55] Fortescue, vol. i. p. 506.\r\n\r\n[56] See Appendix 2 (B).\r\n\r\n[57] Stearne.\r\n\r\n[58] See Appendix 2 (B).\r\n\r\n[59] See Map No. 1.\r\n\r\n[60] Students of the literature of the Peninsular War will remember\r\nfrequent mention of the good terms existing between the British and\r\nFrench soldiers when they met on outpost. Things seem to have been\r\nmuch the same in the time of Marlborough, for Millner says that on\r\nthe night before Malplaquet “several of both sides had frequent and\r\nfriendly Commerce and Conferences with one another, as if we had\r\nbeen in an alliance together; but at last each man being called to\r\nhis respective post, our Commerce was turn’d to, and swallowed up in\r\nblood, as in the Salutations of the day after appeared.”\r\n\r\n[61] The Malplaquet roll (Dalton, vol. 6) gives the names of the\r\nofficers who were at the battle of Malplaquet. The asterisks show\r\nthose who fought at Blenheim, not necessarily in the XVIIIth regiment.\r\n\r\n  Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel--R. Kane.*\r\n\r\n  Brevet Majors--M.

After saying that the enemy\r\nhad carried away all the wheat before the beginning of the siege, he\r\ncontinues, “but we met with a considerable supply, which I fear will\r\nscarce be believed by any but those that saw it. But fact it is, that\r\nthe soldiers found concealments under ground, which the mice had laid\r\nup for their winter store, and that in such abundance, that it was\r\na great relief to us toward the end of the Siege. These hoards were\r\nfrom four to six feet under ground, and in many of them our men found\r\nsome pecks of corn.”\r\n\r\n[65] See Appendix 2 (B).\r\n\r\n[66] See Appendix 2 (B).\r\n\r\n[67] See Appendix 9.\r\n\r\n[68] It is not known whether any of the XVIIIth were included, but it\r\nis probable that Kane brought some of his old regiment with him to\r\nthe post of danger.\r\n\r\n[69] Sayer’s ‘History of Gibraltar,’ p. 295.\r\n\r\n[70] Sayer, p. 197.

This writer mentions that out of the sixty guns\r\nin position at the beginning of the bombardment twenty-three were\r\ndismounted in seven days.\r\n\r\n[72] In 1732 Cosby was succeeded by Sir Charles Hotham, Bart., who\r\non his appointment three years later to a regiment of Guards was\r\nreplaced by Major-General John Armstrong. See Appendix 9.\r\n\r\n[73] See Map No. 2.\r\n\r\n[74] The only mention of British losses at Ostend in the despatches\r\nis a casual reference by Cumberland in a letter, where he speaks of\r\nthe seventy English soldiers taken by the French in the attack on the\r\ncovered way.\r\n\r\n[75] Continuation of Stearne.\r\n\r\n[76] The origin of grenadier companies is mentioned in Chapter I.\r\nLight infantry companies were officially recognised soon after the\r\nend of the Seven Years’ War (1763); they were composed of small,\r\nactive men, trained to act as skirmishers and in the outpost line. It\r\nwas the custom to collect the flank companies of different regiments\r\nand turn them into provisional battalions: for instance, in the\r\nattack on the Terra Nova at Namur the grenadier companies of thirteen\r\nbattalions were detached from their own corps and brigaded together;\r\nand, nearly a hundred years later, both the grenadier and the light\r\ninfantry companies of the garrison of Boston were used in the same\r\nway at Lexington and Bunker’s Hill. After the Crimean War flank\r\ncompanies were abolished.\r\n\r\n[77] See Appendix 2 (C).\r\n\r\n[78] The engagement ought strictly to be called that of Breed’s Hill,\r\nbut it has always been known as Bunker’s Hill, and will be, as long\r\nas the American War of Independence is remembered.\r\n\r\n[79] The reinforcements sent to Prescott raised the number of\r\nprovincials on the peninsula to about 4000, but in Washington’s\r\nopinion not more than 1500 were engaged at any one time during the\r\nday.--Trevelyan’s ‘American Revolution,’ vol. i. p. 363.\r\n\r\n[80] Trevelyan, vol. i. pp. 359, 360.\r\n\r\n[81] Some historians consider that this number should be increased to\r\neleven hundred and fifty.--Fortescue, vol. iii. p. 159.\r\n\r\n[82] See Appendix 2 (C).\r\n\r\n[83] The following officers are shown by the muster roll as present\r\nat Boston on June 25, 1775:--\r\n\r\n  Major--I.

If Moore was\r\naccurate in his spelling of the name, an officer of the XVIIIth\r\nshared with the future hero of Corunna the honour of being first into\r\nthe Mozello. In this assault Lieutenant S. Mawby of the regiment is\r\nknown to have taken part.\r\n\r\n[94] The casualties may have been greater, for the losses in the\r\ngrenadier and light companies cannot be traced. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nWemyss’s wound is not mentioned in the casualty returns.\r\n\r\n[95] See Appendix 2 (E).\r\n\r\n[96] See Map No. 3.\r\n\r\n[97] Minto’s ‘Life of Elliot,’ vol. ii. p. 362.\r\n\r\n[98] The “proof table” in the muster-roll for Christmas, 1796, shows\r\nthat the regiment had only three hundred and eighty-seven officers\r\nand men “present,” while seventy-eight of all ranks were “absent”:\r\nwith the corps, either in the mainland of Italy or in Elba, there\r\nwere only fourteen officers, while twenty-five were on leave or\r\nemployed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[99] The muster-roll of the XVIIIth for Christmas, 1796, was signed\r\nat Elba on April 9, 1797. Among the deaths appears the name of\r\nLieutenant George Mallet, who died during our occupation of the\r\nisland. When the writer of this history visited Elba many years ago,\r\nhe noticed on the wall of the garden where Napoleon used to walk\r\nduring his exile in 1814-15, tablets to the memory of two or three\r\nBritish officers. One of these bore the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n“Near this place lyeth the remains of Lieutenant George Mallett of\r\nthe 18th or Royal Regiment of Ireland who departed this life the 13th\r\nof January 1797 in the 18th year of his age.”\r\n\r\nThanks to the good offices of Mr M. Carmichael, H.M. Consul\r\nat Leghorn, and to the kindness of Lieutenant-General Count\r\nSimminiatelli, commanding the troops in Tuscany, this tablet has been\r\npresented to the regiment, and is now at the depôt at Clonmel.\r\n\r\n[100] Pulteney had been known earlier in his career as Murray; he\r\nchanged his name late in life. See Appendix 9.\r\n\r\n[101] This sudden rush of troops to Gibraltar produced great scarcity\r\nof food. Eggs were sold at a shilling each, while “moderate-sized\r\nturkeys” found eager customers at £3, 10s.\r\n\r\n[102] The conquest of Egypt was no new idea to French statesmen. In\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, while Louis XIV. was revolving\r\nin his mind schemes for the aggrandisement of France, he was urged\r\nstrongly, though unsuccessfully, not to seek expansion in Europe, but\r\nto make himself master of Egypt, and by establishing her pre-eminence\r\nin the Mediterranean secure for his country the trade of the Levant\r\nand of the East.

The boat to which Grattan had been told off\r\nwas fortunate enough to reach the shore, where her crew, passing\r\nthemselves off as Americans, were claimed by the United States Consul\r\nat Macao, and by him sent on to Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n[129] See Appendix 2 (G).\r\n\r\n[130] This draft of 2 sergeants and 305 privates joined on June 8,\r\n1841; the next, 152 rank and file, arrived about Christmas of the\r\nsame year; the third, in June, 1842, was only 43 strong. The officers\r\nwho died were Lieutenants G. W. Davis, S. Haly, and Lieutenant and\r\nAdjutant A. Wilson. The latter was succeeded in his appointment by\r\nLieutenant J. W.

The XVIIIth were 492 of all ranks.\r\n\r\n[139] See Appendix 2 (G).\r\n\r\n[140] In the MS. accounts of this engagement, the writers all mention\r\nthat the regiment marched off “left in front.” The XVIIIth must have\r\nbeen very well drilled to be able to do this, for in those days\r\nvery few regiments could move otherwise than “right in front.” This\r\ninnovation is interesting in connection with the formation of the\r\nRoyal Irish in the attack on the Dockyard Creek at Sebastopol on June\r\n18, 1855, described in chapter vii.\r\n\r\n[141] How susceptible the Chinese soldiery are to the training of\r\nBritish officers was proved first by the success of Gordon’s army in\r\n1860 (see chapter xii.), and later, in 1900, by the good conduct of\r\nthe Wai-Hai-Wai regiment.\r\n\r\n[142] Murray tells us that these white trousers were dug up out of\r\nstore in honour of this ceremonial parade. Throughout the war the\r\nXVIIIth wore blue Nankeen trousers.\r\n\r\n[143] See Appendix 2 (G). These figures, compiled from documents in\r\nthe Record Office, are considerably greater than those given in the\r\ninscription on the memorial. Probably some of the deaths occurred\r\nimmediately after peace was made, and were therefore not included\r\namong the losses during the war.\r\n\r\n[144] Six officers, 6 sergeants, 6 drummers, and 118 rank and file.\r\n\r\n[145] February 21, 1849.\r\n\r\n[146] Some of the officers embarked in the _Buckinghamshire_, an\r\nill-fated ship which was burned at sea on March 3, 1851. They escaped\r\nwith their lives, but the regimental plate, and the trophies won in\r\nmany campaigns by the regiment, were lost, with the exception of one\r\npiece of plate, a gold snuff-box, saved, according to tradition, by\r\nan officer who, when the fire alarm sounded, snatched it off the mess\r\ntable, thrust it into his trousers’ pocket, and brought it safe to\r\nland.\r\n\r\n[147] The Royal Navy was represented by 6 steamers, 80 guns, 818\r\nofficers and men; the Indian Navy by the same number of steamers, 30\r\nguns, 952 officers and men; there were also 7 steamers belonging to\r\nthe uncovenanted Service, carrying 33 guns, with crews amounting in\r\nall to 500. The original land force consisted of 8000 or 9000 troops;\r\nlater arrivals raised General Godwin’s command to a nominal strength\r\nof nearly 20,000.\r\n\r\n[148] The following officers served in the war:--\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel  T.

Hutchins.\r\n\r\n\r\n[162] The allied forces at this time consisted of the English,\r\nFrench, and Turkish troops; the Sardinian contingent of 18,000 men\r\nunder General La Marmora did not reach the Crimea till May, 1855.\r\n\r\n[163] In February, to 290 all ranks.\r\n\r\n[164] Note by the author--This was no improvement on the Peninsula,\r\nwhere the patients suffering from typhus and dysentery were fed in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\n[165] ‘The Crimea in 1854 and 1894,’ by Field-Marshal Sir Evelyn\r\nWood, pp. 204 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[166] Between November, 1854, and February, 1855, there were 9000\r\ndeaths in hospital: at the end of February there were no less than\r\n13,600 officers and men in hospital: and though during that month\r\nlarge drafts raised our strength on paper to 44,000, only 18,000 were\r\n“present and fit for duty.”\r\n\r\n[167] Captain W. Kemp, probably the last surviving officer of the\r\nXVIIIth who served in the Crimea, has supplied the author with much\r\nvaluable information. When a subaltern of six months’ standing,\r\nCaptain Kemp was appointed acting adjutant of the regiment.\r\n\r\n[168] An extract from Hamley’s ‘War in the Crimea,’ p. 208, will show\r\nthe inability of the Treasury to realise the needs of the army in the\r\nCrimea. The Land Transport Corps was formed by an able and energetic\r\nofficer, Colonel McMurdo, “who had so well used his opportunities\r\nthat horses, trained drivers, escorts and vehicles were being rapidly\r\nassembled and organised. All this demanded a great outlay, insomuch\r\nthat on one of the Colonel’s many requisitions, the Secretary to the\r\nTreasury, Sir George Trevelyan, had written, ‘Colonel McMurdo must\r\nlimit his expenditure.’ When the paper returned to the Colonel with\r\nthese words, he wrote below them: ‘When Sir George Trevelyan limits\r\nthe war, I will limit my expenditure!’”\r\n\r\n[169] The influence of Napoleon III.’s personal ambition on the\r\nconduct of the siege and the effect of the rivalries of his Generals\r\nare well described in Hamley’s ‘Crimea,’ wherein the student may\r\nlearn how difficult, if not impossible, it is for the chiefs of two\r\nallied powers, engaged in the same operation of war, to see eye to\r\neye, even on the most important occasions.\r\n\r\n[170] A small rounded hillock, not to be confused with “the Mamelon,”\r\nthe outwork to the Malakoff.\r\n\r\n[171] Russell’s ‘The War,’ vol. i. pp. 490 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[172] According to a tradition in the regiment, the men found the\r\nbreakfast-tables laid for the Russians whom they had so rudely\r\ndispossessed, and promptly availed themselves of the hospitality of\r\ntheir enemies!\r\n\r\n[173] The Victoria Cross was instituted in 1856. Before that time the\r\nonly way in which a non-commissioned officer or private soldier was\r\nrewarded for conduct meriting higher recognition than a medal for\r\nmeritorious conduct in the field was by a dole of money. For officers\r\nthere was no decoration to commemorate a deed of remarkable courage.\r\n\r\n[174] Eyre’s capture of the cemetery and suburb was officially\r\nincluded in the attack on the Redan.\r\n\r\n[175] See Appendix 2 (I).\r\n\r\n[176] Early in 1855 the Government realised that tents were\r\nunsuitable quarters for the besieging army: and wooden huts were sent\r\noff to the Crimea, not of one, but of several sizes and patterns.\r\nThis want of uniformity in design caused great confusion, and the\r\nXVIIIth had not received its full complement of huts at the time of\r\nthe attack on the Redan.\r\n\r\n[177] Since the Russian War no subjects of a foreign power have\r\nbeen enlisted in a body to serve under the British flag. At the end\r\nof the Crimean War a considerable number of the German legion were\r\nsent at their own request to South Africa as settlers, where they\r\nbecame useful members of the white population. During the last war\r\nwith the Boers, the author met in a Free State town an old German\r\ncobbler, who, after proudly dilating on his services in the Legion,\r\nexplained that though he was too old again to shoulder a rifle with\r\nthe British, he would be proud to mend their boots!\r\n\r\n[178] These numbers, which are taken from official documents in the\r\nRecord Office, do not agree completely with those on the Crimean\r\n“Memorial” in St Patrick’s.\r\n\r\n[179] One of the drafts had a narrow escape from shipwreck in the Sea\r\nof Marmora. Their transport, the s.s. _Cleopatra_, in the middle of\r\nthe night of August 15th was in collision with another steamer, the\r\n_Simla_, which was so badly injured that her captain ran her ashore\r\nto prevent her from sinking in deep water; the _Cleopatra_ was cut\r\ndown to the water’s edge, but managed to reach the Golden Horn, where\r\nthe troops were at once transhipped and sent on to Balaclava.\r\n\r\n[180] See Appendix 4.\r\n\r\n[181] From the muster roll of June 25, 1858, it appears that the\r\nofficers in India at that date were--\r\n\r\n  Colonel--C.

Baker, A.M.S.,\r\nwere so constantly mentioned in despatches throughout the war that\r\nit is unnecessary to record the fact after each affair in which they\r\nwere engaged.\r\n\r\n[192] The regimental records of the New Zealand War are far from\r\ncomplete, for the battalion was constantly broken up into small\r\ndetachments, buried in stockades in the depths of the bush. Between\r\nthese detachments and headquarters communication was most difficult,\r\nand for weeks, and even months, the various portions of the regiment\r\nknew nothing of each other’s proceedings.\r\n\r\n[193] ‘Bush Fighting: The Maori War,’ by Major-General Sir J.

Rusden, ‘History of New Zealand,’ vol. ii. p. 45. In\r\nanother passage (p. 173) this author considers that the destruction\r\nof this war party signally foiled the Maoris’ scheme of attack on\r\nCameron’s left and rear.\r\n\r\n[199] Captain Kemp and Captain Briggs have supplied the author with\r\nvaluable information--the former by sending extracts from his diary,\r\nthe latter by recording his reminiscences of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[200] The strength on December 1, 1863, of the ten companies of the\r\nsecond battalion of the XVIIIth was 2 field officers, 9 captains, 20\r\nsubalterns, 5 staff, 47 sergeants, 22 drummers, 763 rank and file fit\r\nfor duty, and 24 sick, or a total of 892 of all ranks.\r\n\r\n[201] Alexander, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[202] This column was composed of 728 of all ranks; among them was\r\na detachment of the Royal Irish--1 captain, 3 subalterns, 1 staff,\r\n5 sergeants, 3 drummers, and 140 rank and file. The smaller columns\r\nwere 250 and 100 strong.\r\n\r\n[203] Carey’s despatch.\r\n\r\n[204] Rusden, vol. ii. p. 205.\r\n\r\n[205] Some of the historians of the New Zealand War assert that these\r\nassaults were ordered by General Carey: others hold that they were\r\nunauthorised: the balance of evidence is in favour of the latter\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n[206] Rusden, vol. ii. pp. 207, 208.\r\n\r\n[207] Two anecdotes will show how stern was the courage of the Maori\r\nwarriors. General Alexander describes how an officer was standing at\r\nthe head of the sap, watching his opportunity to enter the _pah_.\r\nThe head of a fierce-looking Maori appeared above the parapet, but\r\nthe Englishman was a quick shot and the head disappeared. When the\r\ntroops got into the works the officer looked for the man he had hit.\r\nThe Maori had dropped with a bullet through his brain, but this\r\ndeath-wound was not his only injury. Some time during the siege his\r\nleg had been broken and roughly bound up with flax and a tent-peg, to\r\nenable him to go on fighting. In the retreat a native for some time\r\nescorted a party of women and children. “As his pursuers approached,”\r\nsays Mr Rusden, “he turned and knelt down to take deliberate aim.\r\nTime after time, without firing a shot, he thus arrested the pursuit\r\nwhile the women fled. At last he himself was shot, and it was found\r\nthat his gun was not loaded.”\r\n\r\n[208] See Appendix 2 (K).\r\n\r\n[209] General Alexander tells an interesting anecdote about the\r\nfighting in the Taranaki district in 1864. In a skirmish the son of\r\na chief was made a prisoner, badly wounded in the leg. To save his\r\nlife the surgeons amputated the limb, and when the young man was fit\r\nto be moved a message was sent to his father that he might take the\r\nlad back to his village. The chief was very grateful for the kindness\r\nhis son had received at our hands; he presented the General with a\r\ncartload of potatoes, and assured him that in future he would not\r\nkill any wounded soldiers who fell into his hands, but would only cut\r\noff one of their legs and send the men back to camp!\r\n\r\n[210] Fox, pp. 126, 139, 140.\r\n\r\n[211] Hence the name “Hau-Haus,” by which these fanatics were\r\ngenerally known.\r\n\r\n[212] The official description of the act of bravery for which\r\nCaptain Shaw was awarded the Victoria Cross is as follows: “For his\r\ngallant conduct at the skirmish near Nukumaru in New Zealand, in\r\nproceeding under a heavy fire with four privates of the regiment\r\nwho volunteered to accompany him to within thirty yards of the bush\r\noccupied by the rebels, in order to carry off a comrade who was badly\r\nwounded. On the afternoon of that day Captain Shaw was ordered to\r\noccupy a position about half a mile from the camp. He advanced in\r\nskirmishing order, and, when about thirty yards from the bush, he\r\ndeemed it prudent to retire to a palisade about sixty yards from\r\nthe bush, as two of his party had been wounded. Finding that one of\r\nthem was unable to move, he called for volunteers to advance to the\r\nfront to carry the man to the rear, and the four privates referred to\r\naccompanied him, under a heavy fire, to the place where the wounded\r\nman was lying, and they succeeded in bringing him to the rear.”\r\n\r\n[213] See Appendix 2 (K).\r\n\r\n[214] The only event recorded of the stay of the XVIIIth at Patea\r\nis the death of two young officers, Lieutenants Lawson and Jenkins,\r\nwho, unable to swim, were carried by the tide out of their depth and\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n[215] The unavowed but well-understood object of this reduction in\r\nthe regular forces in New Zealand was to throw upon the colonists the\r\nchief burden and expense of the war, of which the Home Government was\r\nthoroughly weary.\r\n\r\n[216] Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman was invalided home in June. As\r\nBrevet-Colonel G. J. Carey was an acting Brigadier-General, Rocke, as\r\nthe next senior officer, assumed the command of the battalion.\r\n\r\n[217] Not to be confounded with the camp near Auckland.\r\n\r\n[218] It was not till 1870 that the last embers of the rebellion were\r\ncompletely stamped out by the local forces of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[219] See Appendix 4.\r\n\r\n[220] See Appendix 2 (K). The rivers in New Zealand took heavy toll\r\nfrom the Royal Irish, eight of whom were drowned in fording streams.\r\n\r\n[221] Three Field-Officers, 8 Captains, 12 Lieutenants, 5 Ensigns,\r\n1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant-Surgeon, 1 Paymaster, 1 Quartermaster, 49\r\nSergeants, 21 drummers, 759 rank and file.\r\n\r\n[222] Governor Sir G.

This stroke of policy made England\r\na large shareholder in the Canal Company, and therefore gave her an\r\nimportant position in the commercial management of its affairs.\r\n\r\n[237] About 90,000 Europeans, chiefly English and French, carried on\r\nbusiness in Egypt at this time.\r\n\r\n[238] Lord Cromer’s ‘Modern Egypt,’ vol. i., gives an excellent\r\naccount of the European diplomacy of this period.\r\n\r\n[239] A quaint report by an Egyptian officer in charge of a battery\r\n“complained of the very improper conduct of the English fleet in\r\nthat, whilst his men were at work on the battery at night, suddenly\r\na blaze of electric light was thrown upon them, so that what they\r\nwere doing could be seen as if it were day--a proceeding which, as\r\nthe officer avers, was distinctly discourteous on the part of the\r\nEnglish.”--Maurice, ‘Military History of the Campaign of 1882 in\r\nEgypt.’\r\n\r\n[240] Reinforcements of many thousands more were on their way to\r\nEgypt when the collapse of Arabi’s rebellion rendered their presence\r\nat the front unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[241] Maurice, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[242] Maurice, pp. 25, 26.\r\n\r\n[243] The officers who went out to Egypt with the battalion were\r\nBrevet-Colonel C.

He replied, “I\r\ndon’t just know, but I killed devil a one less than five hundred with\r\nmy own bayonet!”\r\n\r\n[250] The names will be found in Appendix 2 (M). There is a memorial\r\nto those who died in this campaign in the barrack square of the depôt\r\nat Clonmel.\r\n\r\n[251] The mosquitos at Alexandria appear to have made a great\r\nimpression, not only on the bodies, but also on the imaginations of\r\nthe young officers of the Royal Irish. One subaltern stated that\r\nthese pests had bitten his foot through the sole of a shooting boot,\r\nwhile another asserted that the mosquitos were so intelligent and so\r\nstrong that three of them used to combine to lift up his mosquito-net\r\nto allow their friends to feast upon his hot Irish blood.\r\n\r\n[252] Colvile, ‘History of the Soudan Campaign’ (official), p. 1.\r\n\r\n[253] See Map No. 9.\r\n\r\n[254] Colonel Stewart had already been to Khartoum, where he was sent\r\non a tour of inspection soon after the European officers had demanded\r\nlarge reinforcements to enable them to make head against the Mahdi.\r\n\r\n[255] The junior ranks of the British army are so used to receiving\r\ntheir rations with regularity on active service that they appear to\r\nthink the Army Service Corps can feed them as the ravens fed Elijah.\r\nThey do not realise the enormous amount of thought and calculation\r\nwhich have been lavished on the subject for months before the opening\r\nof a campaign. It is not within the scope of a regimental history\r\nto describe in detail the process by which Lord Wolseley succeeded\r\nin feeding his column in a country the principal products of which\r\nare water and sand. Those who wish to study the subject will find\r\nfull information in Colvile’s ‘History of the Soudan Campaign,’ and\r\nButler’s ‘Campaign of the Cataracts.’\r\n\r\n[256]\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonels--H.

The\r\nadvance-guard of two companies of the Royal Irish was followed in\r\nsuccession by brigade headquarters, two guns, and three companies\r\nof Native infantry. Then came the headquarters of the column, the\r\nremainder of the Royal Irish, two more guns and some Gatlings, five\r\ncompanies of native infantry, the regimental reserve ammunition, a\r\ncompany of native infantry, the Field hospital, and a detachment of\r\nRoyal Engineer telegraphists. In rear was the whole of the baggage,\r\nincluding the seven days’ supply, escorted by four companies of\r\nnative infantry.\r\n\r\n[270] These are the official figures. In the opinion of some of the\r\nofficers who were present they are too high.\r\n\r\n[271] As the official account states that eighty-eight dead bodies\r\nwere found on the ground over which the swordsmen attempted to\r\ncharge, it is clear that the Royal Irish used their weapons to good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[272] This trophy, pierced with more than one bullet, hangs in the\r\nOfficers’ Mess of the second battalion.\r\n\r\n[273] While the regiment was at the front Mr Rudyard Kipling in a\r\nballad made the immortal Mulvaney predict the result of sending an\r\nIrish corps on a campaign where field canteens were not allowed.\r\nThanks to the kind permission of Mr Kipling the ballad is reproduced.\r\n\r\n  “THE WAY AV UT!”\r\n\r\n  “The Black Mountain Expedition is apparently to be a tetotal\r\n  affair.”--_Vide_ ‘Civil and Military Gazette,’ October 5, 1888.\r\n\r\n  “A charge of Ghazis was met by the Royal Irish, who accounted\r\n  for the whole of them....

The\r\ngraves at Bethlehem were also in good order.\r\n\r\n[303] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[304] Lance-Corporal Doyle was promoted to be corporal on July 26,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\n[305] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[306] In South Africa every estate in the country is called a farm,\r\nbut this is a misnomer, for no Boer landowner (at least before the\r\nwar) thought of working his estate as a farm in the European sense of\r\nthe word. He was indifferent to agriculture, and devoted his land to\r\nthe raising of stock. By Australians the Boer farms would be called\r\nruns; by Canadians from the north-west of the Dominion they would be\r\ndescribed as ranches.\r\n\r\n[307] Official History, vol. iii. p. 380.\r\n\r\n[308] In Hamilton’s Force were soldiers from all parts of the British\r\nEmpire. The Divisional troops were Brabant’s Horse (South African\r\nvolunteers); two batteries of Royal Field artillery; four guns of\r\na Canadian volunteer battery; the “Elswick battery,” manned by\r\nartisans, volunteers from the north of England; two 5-in. guns, and\r\na section of pom-poms.\r\n\r\nMahon’s Force was composed of a battery of Royal Horse artillery;\r\na section of pom-poms; the Imperial Light Horse (South African\r\nvolunteers); Lumsden’s Horse (volunteers from India, largely\r\nrecruited from planters in Behar); a battalion of Imperial Yeomanry\r\n(volunteers from the Old Country); a squadron of Hussars, and mounted\r\nvolunteers from Queensland and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nInfantry brigades--Smith-Dorrien’s: the first battalions of the Royal\r\nScots, Royal Irish, and Gordon Highlanders, and the mounted infantry\r\nof the City Imperial volunteers; Cunningham’s: 1st battalion King’s\r\nOwn Scottish Borderers, 2nd battalion Royal Berkshire regiment, 1st\r\nbattalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.\r\n\r\nThe Engineers, Ammunition and Supply Park, Hospitals, and Bearer\r\nCompanies were all supplied by the regular army.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Smith-Dorrien’s Infantry units was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                            Fit for duty.\r\n                     -------------------------     Sick at\r\n                           At           On     headquarters or  Total.\r\n                     headquarters.  detachment. on detachment.\r\n  1st Royal Scots         1206           61           121        1388\r\n  1st Royal Irish          868          239           199        1306\r\n  1st Gordon Highlanders   741          236           153        1130\r\n\r\n\r\n[309] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[310] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[311] The experience gained after some months of escorting trains is\r\nepitomised in the instructions issued by the Chief of the General\r\nStaff, which will be found in Appendix 7.\r\n\r\n[312] Barry had served with the 2nd battalion in the campaigns on the\r\nnorth-west frontier of India.\r\n\r\n[313] The machine gun was recaptured a few months later by the Royal\r\nIrish, and was presented to the regiment by the Secretary of State\r\nfor War in 1904.\r\n\r\n[314] For his conduct on this occasion No. 4216 Corporal H. N. Forbes\r\nwas awarded the medal for Distinguished Conduct in the Field.\r\n\r\n[315] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[316] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[317] According to regimental tradition the information reached\r\nCaptain White, Royal Irish, the local Intelligence officer, in a\r\ncurious way. Viljoen had in his service a Kaffir, whose father was\r\nemployed by us at Lydenburg. The younger Kaffir overheard Viljoen\r\nmention in conversation that he meant to return to Pilgrim’s Rest\r\non a certain day; and obtaining leave of absence, passed the news\r\non to his father, who in his turn reported it to the Intelligence\r\ndepartment. It seems almost incredible that Viljoen should have been\r\nguilty of such an indiscretion as to talk of his intended movements\r\nwithin earshot of a Kaffir: but if the account is accurate, it\r\naffords another illustration of the truth of the saying--“What is\r\nrumoured in your camp to-day will be known to-morrow by the enemy.”\r\n\r\n[318] Afterwards Sergeant-Major, 2nd battalion, Royal Irish regiment.\r\n\r\n[319] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[320] See Appendix 2 (Q). Captain St Leger’s exploit would\r\nhave remained unknown had not Corporal Parker written to his\r\nown commanding officer to report the matter. Unfortunately the\r\nnon-commissioned officer’s letter did not reach the War Office until\r\nthe list of rewards for South Africa was finally closed.\r\n\r\n[321] As early as May, 1900, the author ascertained from Boer\r\nprisoners that in the commandos it was commonly said that if the\r\nburghers were driven out of Pretoria they would break back through\r\nthe east of the Free State and burst into Cape Colony by the drifts\r\nover the Orange river near Aliwal North.\r\n\r\n[322] This man’s death was a sad one: he fell down a well, 45 feet\r\ndeep, at Needspan, and his body was not discovered for several days.\r\nAn officer writes of him: “he was one of the best soldiers and the\r\ncheeriest of men whom I have ever met; and his behaviour both in camp\r\nand field was excellent.”\r\n\r\n[323] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[324] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[325] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[326] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[327] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[328] See Appendix 2 (Q).\r\n\r\n[329] The names of most of the militia officers who were seconded\r\nin these battalions for service in South Africa have been mentioned\r\nalready; among the others who did duty either with mounted infantry\r\nor with other infantry corps at the seat of war were: Captains G. H.\r\nP. Colley, J. O. Johnson, A. J. Fox, and Lieutenant E. H. B. Thompson.\r\n\r\n[330] _I.e._, identity card.\r\n\r\n[331] The Memorials are enumerated, and described in the order that\r\nthey appear in the frontispiece, commencing on the left.\r\n\r\n[332] These are grouped round the South African Window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\n  All changes noted in the CORRIGENDA at the front of the book have\r\n  been applied to the etext.\r\n\r\n  Some Footnotes having the same text on a page were merged in the\r\n  original book, for example ‘1 & 2 See Appendix 9’.
