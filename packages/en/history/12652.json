The United States flag shown in the picture is an\r\nanachronism. The stars and stripes were first adopted by Congress in\r\nJune, 1777; and any flag carried by Washington's army in December,\r\n1776, would have consisted of the stripes with the crosses of St.\r\nGeorge and St. Andrew in the blue field where the stars now appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nFebruary 9 in the year 1800 was a gala day in Paris. Napoleon had\r\ndecreed a triumphal procession, and on that day a splendid military\r\nceremony was performed in the Champ de Mars, and the trophies of the\r\nEgyptian expedition were exultingly displayed. There were, however,\r\ntwo features in all this pomp and show which seemed strangely out\r\nof keeping with the glittering pageant and the sounds of victorious\r\nrejoicing. The standards and flags of the army were hung with crape,\r\nand after the grand parade the dignitaries of the land proceeded\r\nsolemnly to the Temple of Mars, and heard the eloquent M. de Fontanes\r\ndeliver an \"Eloge Funèbre.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A report recently discovered shows that more even was\r\nintended than was actually done.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the paper, the original of which\r\nis Nos. 172 and 173 of volume 51 of the manuscript series known as\r\n_Etats-Unis_, 1799, 1800 (years 7 and 8 of the French republic):--\r\n\r\n    \"_Report of Talleyrand, Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the\r\n    occasion of the death of George Washington_.\r\n\r\n    \"A nation which some day will he a great nation, and which today\r\n    is the wisest and happiest on the face of the earth, weeps at the\r\n    bier of a man whose courage and genius contributed the most to\r\n    free it from bondage, and elevate it to the rank of an independent\r\n    and sovereign power. The regrets caused by the death of this\r\n    great man, the memories aroused by these regrets, and a proper\r\n    veneration for all that is held dear and sacred by mankind, impel\r\n    us to give expression to our sentiments by taking part in an event\r\n    which deprives the world of one of its brightest ornaments, and\r\n    removes to the realm of history one of the noblest lives that ever\r\n    honored the human race.\r\n\r\n    \"The name of Washington is inseparably linked with a memorable\r\n    epoch. He adorned this epoch by his talents and the nobility of\r\n    his character, and with virtues that even envy dared not assail.\r\n    History offers few examples of such renown. Great from the outset\r\n    of his career, patriotic before his country had become a nation,\r\n    brilliant and universal despite the passions and political\r\n    resentments that would gladly have checked his career, his fame\r\n    is to-day imperishable,--fortune having consecrated his claim to\r\n    greatness, while the prosperity of a people destined for grand\r\n    achievements is the best evidence of a fame ever to increase.\r\n\r\n    \"His own country now honors his memory with funeral ceremonies,\r\n    having lost a citizen whose public actions and unassuming grandeur\r\n    in private life were a living example of courage, wisdom, and\r\n    unselfishness; and France, which from the dawn of the American\r\n    Revolution hailed with hope a nation, hitherto unknown, that was\r\n    discarding the vices of Europe, which foresaw all the glory that\r\n    this nation would bestow on humanity, and the enlightenment of\r\n    governments that would ensue from the novel character of the\r\n    social institutions and the new type of heroism of which\r\n    Washington and America were models for the world at\r\n    large,--France, I repeat, should depart from established usages\r\n    and do honor to one whose fame is beyond comparison with that of\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    \"The man who, amid the decadence of modern ages, first dared\r\n    believe that he could inspire degenerate nations with courage to\r\n    rise to the level of republican virtues, lived for all nations and\r\n    for all centuries; and this nation, which first saw in the life\r\n    and success of that illustrious man a foreboding of its destiny,\r\n    and therein recognized a future to be realized and duties to be\r\n    performed, has every right to class him as a fellow-citizen. I\r\n    therefore submit to the First Consul the following decree:--\r\n      \"Bonaparte, First Consul of the republic, decrees as follows:--\r\n      \"Article 1. A statue is to be erected to General Washington.\r\n      \"Article 2. This statue is to be placed in one of the squares of\r\n    Paris, to be chosen by the minister of the interior, and it shall\r\n    be his duty to execute the present decree.\"]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, if tradition may be trusted, the flags upon the\r\nconquering Channel fleet of England were lowered to half-mast in token\r\nof grief for the same event which had caused the armies of France to\r\nwear the customary badges of mourning.\r\n\r\nIf some \"traveler from an antique land\" had observed these\r\nmanifestations, he would have wondered much whose memory it was that\r\nhad called them forth from these two great nations, then struggling\r\nfiercely with each other for supremacy on land and sea. His wonder\r\nwould not have abated had he been told that the man for whom they\r\nmourned had wrested an empire from one, and at the time of his death\r\nwas arming his countrymen against the other.\r\n\r\nThese signal honors were paid by England and France to a simple\r\nVirginian gentleman who had never left his own country, and who when\r\nhe died held no other office than the titular command of a provisional\r\narmy. Yet although these marks of respect from foreign nations were\r\nnotable and striking, they were slight and formal in comparison with\r\nthe silence and grief which fell upon the people of the United States\r\nwhen they heard that Washington was dead. He had died in the fullness\r\nof time, quietly, quickly, and in his own house, and yet his death\r\ncalled out a display of grief which has rarely been equaled in\r\nhistory. The trappings and suits of woe were there of course, but what\r\nmade this mourning memorable was that the land seemed hushed with\r\nsadness, and that the sorrow dwelt among the people and was neither\r\nforced nor fleeting. Men carried it home with them to their firesides\r\nand to their churches, to their offices and their workshops. Every\r\npreacher took the life which had closed as the noblest of texts, and\r\nevery orator made it the theme of his loftiest eloquence. For more\r\nthan a year the newspapers teemed with eulogy and elegy, and both\r\nprose and poetry were severely taxed to pay tribute to the memory of\r\nthe great one who had gone. The prose was often stilted and the verse\r\nwas generally bad, but yet through it all, from the polished sentences\r\nof the funeral oration to the humble effusions of the obscurest poet's\r\ncorner, there ran a strong and genuine feeling, which the highest art\r\ncould not refine nor the clumsiest expression degrade.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to this, the stream of praise has flowed on, ever\r\ndeepening and strengthening, both at home and abroad. Washington alone\r\nin history seems to have risen so high in the estimation of men that\r\ncriticism has shrunk away abashed, and has only been heard whispering\r\nin corners or growling hoarsely in the now famous house in Cheyne Row.\r\n\r\nThere is a world of meaning in all this, could we but rightly\r\ninterpret it. It cannot be brushed aside as mere popular superstition,\r\nformed of fancies and prejudices, to which intelligent opposition\r\nwould be useless. Nothing is in fact more false than the way in which\r\npopular opinions are often belittled and made light of. The opinion\r\nof the world, however reached, becomes in the course of years or\r\ncenturies the nearest approach we can make to final judgment on\r\nhuman things. Don Quixote may be dumb to one man, and the sonnets of\r\nShakespeare may leave another cold and weary. But the fault is in\r\nthe reader. There is no doubt of the greatness of Cervantes or\r\nShakespeare, for they have stood the test of time, and the voices of\r\ngenerations of men, from which there is no appeal, have declared them\r\nto be great. The lyrics that all the world loves and repeats, the\r\npoetry which is often called hackneyed, is on the whole the best\r\npoetry. The pictures and statues that have drawn crowds of admiring\r\ngazers for centuries are the best. The things that are \"caviare to the\r\ngeneral\" often undoubtedly have much merit, but they lack quite as\r\noften the warm, generous, and immortal vitality which appeals alike to\r\nrich and poor, to the ignorant and to the learned.\r\n\r\nSo it is with men. When years after his death the world agrees to call\r\na man great, the verdict must be accepted. The historian may whiten or\r\nblacken, the critic may weigh and dissect, the form of the judgment\r\nmay be altered, but the central fact remains, and with the man, whom\r\nthe world in its vague way has pronounced great, history must reckon\r\none way or the other, whether for good or ill.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to such a man as Washington, the case is still stronger.\r\nMen seem to have agreed that here was greatness which no one could\r\nquestion, and character which no one could fail to respect. Around\r\nother leaders of men, even around the greatest of them, sharp\r\ncontroversies have arisen, and they have their partisans dead as they\r\nhad them living. Washington had enemies who assailed him, and friends\r\nwhom he loved, but in death as in life he seems to stand alone, above\r\nconflict and superior to malice. In his own country there is no\r\ndispute as to his greatness or his worth. Englishmen, the most\r\nunsparing censors of everything American, have paid homage to\r\nWashington, from the days of Fox and Byron to those of Tennyson and\r\nGladstone. In France his name has always been revered, and in distant\r\nlands those who have scarcely heard of the existence of the United\r\nStates know the country of Washington. To the mighty cairn which the\r\nnation and the states have raised to his memory, stones have come\r\nfrom Greece, sending a fragment of the Parthenon; from Brazil and\r\nSwitzerland, Turkey and Japan, Siam and India beyond the Ganges. On\r\nthat sent by China we read: \"In devising plans, Washington was more\r\ndecided than Ching Shing or Woo Kwang; in winning a country he was\r\nbraver than Tsau Tsau or Ling Pi. Wielding his four-footed falchion,\r\nhe extended the frontiers and refused to accept the Royal Dignity. The\r\nsentiments of the Three Dynasties have reappeared in him. Can any man\r\nof ancient or modern times fail to pronounce Washington peerless?\"\r\nThese comparisons so strange to our ears tell of a fame which has\r\nreached farther than we can readily conceive.\r\n\r\nWashington stands as a type, and has stamped himself deep upon the\r\nimagination of mankind. Whether the image be true or false is of no\r\nconsequence: the fact endures. He rises up from the dust of history as\r\na Greek statue comes pure and serene from the earth in which it has\r\nlain for centuries. We know his deeds; but what was it in the man\r\nwhich has given him such a place in the affection, the respect, and\r\nthe imagination of his fellow men throughout the world?\r\n\r\nPerhaps this question has been fully answered already. Possibly every\r\none who has thought upon the subject has solved the problem, so that\r\neven to state it is superfluous. Yet a brilliant writer, the latest\r\nhistorian of the American people, has said: \"General Washington is\r\nknown to us, and President Washington. But George Washington is an\r\nunknown man.\" These are pregnant words, and that they should be true\r\nseems to make any attempt to fill the great gap an act of sheer and\r\nhopeless audacity. Yet there can be certainly no reason for adding\r\nanother to the almost countless lives of Washington unless it be done\r\nwith the object in view which Mr. McMaster indicates. Any such attempt\r\nmay fail in execution, but if the purpose be right it has at least an\r\nexcuse for its existence.\r\n\r\nTo try to add to the existing knowledge of the facts in Washington's\r\ncareer would have but little result beyond the multiplication of\r\nprinted pages. The antiquarian, the historian, and the critic have\r\nexhausted every source, and the most minute details have been and\r\nstill are the subject of endless writing and constant discussion.\r\nEvery house he ever lived in has been drawn and painted; every\r\nportrait, and statue, and medal has been catalogued and engraved. His\r\nprivate affairs, his servants, his horses, his arms, even his clothes,\r\nhave all passed beneath the merciless microscope of history. His\r\nbiography has been written and rewritten. His letters have been drawn\r\nout from every lurking place, and have been given to the world in\r\nmasses and in detachments. His battles have been fought over and\r\nover again, and his state papers have undergone an almost verbal\r\nexamination. Yet, despite his vast fame and all the labors of the\r\nantiquarian and biographer, Washington is still not understood,--as a\r\nman he is unfamiliar to the posterity that reverences his memory. He\r\nhas been misrepresented more or less covertly by hostile critics and\r\nby candid friends, and has been disguised and hidden away by the\r\nmistaken eulogy and erroneous theories of devout admirers. All that\r\nany one now can do, therefore, is to endeavor from this mass of\r\nmaterial to depict the very man himself in the various conjunctures of\r\nhis life, and strive to see what he really was and what he meant then,\r\nand what he is and what he means to us and to the world to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of time Washington has become in the popular\r\nimagination largely mythical; for mythical ideas grow up in this\r\nnineteenth century, notwithstanding its boasted intelligence, much as\r\nthey did in the infancy of the race. The old sentiment of humanity,\r\nmore ancient and more lasting than any records or monuments, which led\r\nmen in the dawn of history to worship their ancestors and the founders\r\nof states, still endures. As the centuries have gone by, this\r\nsentiment has lost its religious flavor, and has become more and\r\nmore restricted in its application, but it has never been wholly\r\nextinguished. Let some man arise great above the ordinary bounds of\r\ngreatness, and the feeling which caused our progenitors to bow down\r\nat the shrines of their forefathers and chiefs leads us to invest\r\nour modern hero with a mythical character, and picture him in our\r\nimagination as a being to whom, a few thousand years ago, altars would\r\nhave been builded and libations poured out.\r\n\r\nThus we have to-day in our minds a Washington grand, solemn, and\r\nimpressive. In this guise he appears as a man of lofty intellect, vast\r\nmoral force, supremely successful and fortunate, and wholly apart\r\nfrom and above all his fellow-men. This lonely figure rises up to our\r\nimagination with all the imperial splendor of the Livian Augustus, and\r\nwith about as much warmth and life as that unrivaled statue. In this\r\nvague but quite serious idea there is a great deal of truth, but\r\nnot the whole truth. It is the myth of genuine love and veneration\r\nspringing from the inborn gratitude of man to the founders and chiefs\r\nof his race, but it is not by any means the only one of its family.\r\nThere is another, equally diffused, of wholly different parentage.\r\nIn its inception this second myth is due to the itinerant parson,\r\nbookmaker, and bookseller, Mason Weems. He wrote a brief biography of\r\nWashington, of trifling historical value, yet with sufficient literary\r\nskill to make it widely popular. It neither appealed to nor was read\r\nby the cultivated and instructed few, but it reached the homes of the\r\nmasses of the people. It found its way to the bench of the mechanic,\r\nto the house of the farmer, to the log cabins of the frontiersman and\r\npioneer. It was carried across the continent on the first waves of\r\nadvancing settlement. Its anecdotes and its simplicity of thought\r\ncommended it to children both at home and at school, and, passing\r\nthrough edition after edition, its statements were widely spread, and\r\nit colored insensibly the ideas of hundreds of persons who never had\r\nheard even the name of the author. To Weems we owe the anecdote of the\r\ncherry-tree, and other tales of a similar nature. He wrote with Dr.\r\nBeattie's life of his son before him as a model, and the result is\r\nthat Washington comes out in his pages a faultless prig. Whether Weems\r\nintended it or not, that is the result which he produced, and that is\r\nthe Washington who was developed from the wide sale of his book. When\r\nthis idea took definite and permanent shape it caused a reaction.\r\nThere was a revolt against it, for the hero thus engendered had\r\nqualities which the national sense of humor could not endure in\r\nsilence. The consequence is, that the Washington of Weems has afforded\r\nan endless theme for joke and burlesque. Every professional American\r\nhumorist almost has tried his hand at it; and with each recurring 22d\r\nof February the hard-worked jesters of the daily newspapers take it\r\nup and make a little fun out of it, sufficient for the day that is\r\npassing over them. The opportunity is tempting, because of the ease\r\nwith which fun can be made when that fundamental source of humor, a\r\nviolent contrast, can be employed. But there is no irreverence in it\r\nall, for the jest is not aimed at the real Washington, but at the\r\nWashington portrayed in the Weems biography. The worthy \"rector of\r\nMount Vernon,\" as he called himself, meant no harm, and there is a\r\ngood deal of truth, no doubt, in his book. But the blameless and\r\npriggish boy, and the equally faultless and uninteresting man, whom he\r\noriginated, have become in the process of development a myth. So in\r\nits further development is the Washington of the humorist a myth.\r\nBoth alike are utterly and crudely false. They resemble their great\r\noriginal as much as Greenough's classically nude statue, exposed to\r\nthe incongruities of the North American climate, resembles in dress\r\nand appearance the general of our armies and the first President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nSuch are the myth-makers. They are widely different from the critics\r\nwho have assailed Washington in a sidelong way, and who can be better\r\ndealt with in a later chapter. These last bring charges which can be\r\nmet; the myth-maker presents a vague conception, extremely difficult\r\nto handle because it is so elusive.\r\n\r\nOne of our well-known historical scholars and most learned\r\nantiquarians, not long ago, in an essay vindicating the \"traditional\r\nWashington,\" treated with scorn the idea of a \"new Washington\" being\r\ndiscovered. In one sense this is quite right, in another totally\r\nwrong. There can be no new Washington discovered, because there never\r\nwas but one. But the real man has been so overlaid with myths and\r\ntraditions, and so distorted by misleading criticisms, that, as\r\nhas already been suggested, he has been wellnigh lost. We have\r\nthe religious or statuesque myth, we have the Weems myth, and the\r\nludicrous myth of the writer of paragraphs. We have the stately hero\r\nof Sparks, and Everett, and Marshall, and Irving, with all his great\r\ndeeds as general and president duly recorded and set down in polished\r\nand eloquent sentences; and we know him to be very great and wise and\r\npure, and, be it said with bated breath, very dry and cold. We are\r\nalso familiar with the common-place man who so wonderfully illustrated\r\nthe power of character as set forth by various persons, either from\r\nlove of novelty or because the great chief seemed to get in the way of\r\ntheir own heroes.\r\n\r\nIf this is all, then the career of Washington and his towering fame\r\npresent a problem of which the world has never seen the like. But this\r\ncannot be all: there must be more behind. Every one knows the famous\r\nStuart portrait of Washington. The last effort of the artist's cunning\r\nis there employed to paint his great subject for posterity. How serene\r\nand beautiful it is! It is a noble picture for future ages to look\r\nupon. Still it is not all. There is in the dining-room of Memorial\r\nHall at Cambridge another portrait, painted by Savage. It is cold and\r\ndry, hard enough to serve for the signboard of an inn, and able, one\r\nwould think, to withstand all weathers. Yet this picture has something\r\nwhich Stuart left out. There is a rugged strength in the face which\r\ngives us pause, there is a massiveness in the jaw, telling of an iron\r\ngrip and a relentless will, which has infinite meaning.\r\n\r\n  \"Here's John the Smith's rough-hammered head. Great eye,\r\n  Gross jaw, and griped lips do what granite can\r\n  To give you the crown-grasper. What a man!\"\r\n\r\nIn death as in life, there is something about Washington, call it\r\ngreatness, dignity, majesty, what you will, which seems to hold men\r\naloof and keep them from knowing him. In truth he was a most difficult\r\nman to know. Carlyle, crying out through hundreds of pages and myriads\r\nof words for the \"silent man,\" passed by with a sneer the most\r\nabsolutely silent great man that history can show. Washington's\r\nletters and speeches and messages fill many volumes, but they are all\r\non business. They are profoundly silent as to the writer himself. From\r\nthis Carlyle concluded apparently that there was nothing to tell,--a\r\nvery shallow conclusion if it was the one he really reached. Such an\r\nidea was certainly far, very far, from the truth.\r\n\r\nBehind the popular myths, behind the statuesque figure of the orator\r\nand the preacher, behind the general and the president of the\r\nhistorian, there was a strong, vigorous man, in whose veins ran warm,\r\nred blood, in whose heart were stormy passions and deep sympathy for\r\nhumanity, in whose brain were far-reaching thoughts, and who was\r\ninformed throughout his being with a resistless will. The veil of his\r\nsilence is not often lifted, and never intentionally, but now and then\r\nthere is a glimpse behind it; and in stray sentences and in little\r\nincidents strenuously gathered together; above all, in the right\r\ninterpretation of the words, and the deeds, and the true history known\r\nto all men,--we can surely find George Washington \"the noblest figure\r\nthat ever stood in the forefront of a nation's life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE OLD DOMINION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo know George Washington, we must first of all understand the society\r\nin which he was born and brought up. As certain lilies draw their\r\ncolors from the subtle qualities of the soil hidden beneath the water\r\nupon which they float, so are men profoundly affected by the obscure\r\nand insensible influences which surround their childhood and youth.\r\nThe art of the chemist may discover perhaps the secret agent which\r\ntints the white flower with blue or pink, but very often the elements,\r\nwhich analysis detects, nature alone can combine. The analogy is\r\nnot strained or fanciful when we apply it to a past society. We can\r\nseparate, and classify, and label the various elements, but to combine\r\nthem in such a way as to form a vivid picture is a work of surpassing\r\ndifficulty. This is especially true of such a land as Virginia in the\r\nmiddle of the last century. Virginian society, as it existed at that\r\nperiod, is utterly extinct. John Randolph said it had departed before\r\nthe year 1800. Since then another century, with all its manifold\r\nchanges, has wellnigh come and gone. Most important of all, the last\r\nsurviving institution of colonial Virginia has been swept away in the\r\ncrash of civil war, which has opened a gulf between past and present\r\nwider and deeper than any that time alone could make.\r\n\r\nLife and society as they existed in the Virginia of the eighteenth\r\ncentury seem, moreover, to have been sharply broken and ended. We\r\ncannot trace our steps backward, as is possible in most cases, over\r\nthe road by which the world has traveled since those days. We are\r\ncompelled to take a long leap mentally in order to land ourselves\r\nsecurely in the Virginia which honored the second George, and looked\r\nup to Walpole and Pitt as the arbiters of its fate.\r\n\r\nWe live in a period of great cities, rapid communication, vast and\r\nvaried business interests, enormous diversity of occupation, great\r\nindustries, diffused intelligence, farming by steam, and with\r\neverything and everybody pervaded by an unresting, high-strung\r\nactivity. We transport ourselves to the Virginia of Washington's\r\nboyhood, and find a people without cities or towns, with no means\r\nof communication except what was afforded by rivers and wood roads;\r\nhaving no trades, no industries, no means of spreading knowledge, only\r\none occupation, clumsily performed; and living a quiet, monotonous\r\nexistence, which can now hardly be realized. It is \"a far cry to\r\nLoch-Awe,\" as the Scotch proverb has it; and this old Virginian\r\nsociety, although we should find it sorry work living in it, is both\r\npleasant and picturesque in the pages of history.\r\n\r\nThe population of Virginia, advancing toward half a million, and\r\ndivided pretty equally between the free whites and the enslaved\r\nblacks, was densest, to use a most inappropriate word, at the water's\r\nedge and near the mouths of the rivers. Thence it crept backwards,\r\nfollowing always the lines of the watercourses, and growing ever\r\nthinner and more scattered until it reached the Blue Ridge. Behind\r\nthe mountains was the wilderness, haunted, as old John Lederer said a\r\ncentury earlier, by monsters, and inhabited, as the eighteenth-century\r\nVirginians very well knew, by savages and wild beasts, much more real\r\nand dangerous than the hobgoblins of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe population, in proportion to its numbers, was very widely\r\ndistributed. It was not collected in groups, after the fashion with\r\nwhich we are now familiar, for then there were no cities or towns\r\nin Virginia. The only place which could pretend to either name was\r\nNorfolk, the solitary seaport, which, with its six or seven thousand\r\ninhabitants, formed the most glaring exception that any rule\r\nsolicitous of proof could possibly desire. Williamsburg, the capital,\r\nwas a straggling village, somewhat overweighted with the public\r\nbuildings and those of the college. It would light up into life and\r\nvivacity during the season of politics and society, and then relapse\r\nagain into the country stillness. Outside of Williamsburg and Norfolk\r\nthere were various points which passed in the catalogue and on the map\r\nfor towns, but which in reality were merely the shadows of a name. The\r\nmost populous consisted of a few houses inhabited by storekeepers and\r\ntraders, some tobacco warehouses, and a tavern, clustered about the\r\nchurch or court-house. Many others had only the church, or, if a\r\ncounty seat, the church and court-house, keeping solitary state in the\r\nwoods. There once a week the sound of prayer and gossip, or at longer\r\nintervals the voices of lawyers and politicians, and the shouts of the\r\nwrestlers on the green, broke through the stillness which with the\r\ngoing down of the sun resumed its sway in the forests.\r\n\r\nThere was little chance here for that friction of mind with mind, or\r\nfor that quick interchange of thought and sentiment and knowledge\r\nwhich are familiar to the dwellers in cities, and which have driven\r\nforward more rapidly than all else what we call civilization. Rare\r\nmeetings for special objects with persons as solitary in their lives\r\nand as ill-informed as himself, constituted to the average Virginian\r\nthe world of society, and there was nothing from outside to supply the\r\ndeficiencies at home. Once a fortnight a mail crawled down from\r\nthe North, and once a month another crept on to the South. George\r\nWashington was four years old when the first newspaper was published\r\nin the colony, and he was twenty when the first actors appeared at\r\nWilliamsburg. What was not brought was not sought. The Virginians did\r\nnot go down to the sea in ships. They were not a seafaring race, and\r\nas they had neither trade nor commerce they were totally destitute of\r\nthe inquiring, enterprising spirit, and of the knowledge brought\r\nby those pursuits which involve travel and adventure. The English\r\ntobacco-ships worked their way up the rivers, taking the great staple,\r\nand leaving their varied goods, and their tardy news from Europe,\r\nwherever they stopped. This was the sum of the information and\r\nintercourse which Virginia got from across the sea, for travelers were\r\npractically unknown. Few came on business, fewer still from curiosity.\r\nStray peddlers from the North, or trappers from beyond the mountains\r\nwith their packs of furs, chiefly constituted what would now be called\r\nthe traveling public. There were in truth no means of traveling except\r\non foot, on horseback, or by boat on the rivers, which formed the\r\nbest and most expeditious highways. Stage-coaches, or other public\r\nconveyances, were unknown. Over some of the roads the rich man, with\r\nhis six horses and black outriders, might make his way in a lumbering\r\ncarriage, but most of the roads were little better than woodland\r\npaths; and the rivers, innocent of bridges, offered in the uncertain\r\nfords abundance of inconvenience, not unmixed with peril. The taverns\r\nwere execrable, and only the ever-ready hospitality of the people\r\nmade it possible to get from place to place. The result was that the\r\nVirginians stayed at home, and sought and welcomed the rare stranger\r\nat their gates as if they were well aware that they were entertaining\r\nangels.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to sift this home-keeping people, and find out\r\nthat portion which was Virginia, for the mass was but an appendage\r\nof the small fraction which ruled, led, and did the thinking for the\r\nwhole community. Half the people were slaves, and in that single\r\nwretched word their history is told. They were, on the whole, well\r\nand kindly treated, but they have no meaning in history except as an\r\ninstitution, and as an influence in the lives, feelings, and character\r\nof the men who made the state.\r\n\r\nAbove the slaves, little better than they in condition, but separated\r\nfrom them by the wide gulf of race and color, were the indented white\r\nservants, some convicts, some redemptioners. They, too, have their\r\nstory told when we have catalogued them. We cross another gulf and\r\ncome to the farmers, to the men who grew wheat as well as tobacco on\r\ntheir own land, sometimes working alone, sometimes the owners of a few\r\nslaves. Some of these men were of the class well known since as the\r\n\"poor whites\" of the South, the weaker brothers who could not resist\r\nthe poison of slavery, but sank under it into ignorance and poverty.\r\nThey were contented because their skins were white, and because they\r\nwere thereby part of an aristocracy to whom labor was a badge of\r\nserfdom. The larger portion of this middle class, however, were\r\nthrifty and industrious enough. Including as they did in their ranks\r\nthe hunters and pioneers, the traders and merchants, all the freemen\r\nin fact who toiled and worked, they formed the mass of the white\r\npopulation, and furnished the bone and sinew and some of the\r\nintellectual power of Virginia. The only professional men were the\r\nclergy, for the lawyers were few, and growing to importance only as\r\nthe Revolution began; while the physicians were still fewer, and as a\r\nclass of no importance at all. The clergy were a picturesque\r\nelement in the social landscape, but they were as a body very poor\r\nrepresentatives of learning, religion, and morality. They ranged from\r\nhedge parsons and Fleet chaplains, who had slunk away from England\r\nto find a desirable obscurity in the new world, to divines of real\r\nlearning and genuine piety, who were the supporters of the college,\r\nand who would have been a credit to any society. These last, however,\r\nwere lamentably few in number. The mass of the clergy were men who\r\nworked their own lands, sold tobacco, were the boon companions of the\r\nplanters, hunted, shot, drank hard, and lived well, performing their\r\nsacred duties in a perfunctory and not always in a decent manner.\r\n\r\nThe clergy, however, formed the stepping-stone socially between\r\nthe farmers, traders, and small planters, and the highest and most\r\nimportant class in Virginian society. The great planters were the\r\nmen who owned, ruled, and guided Virginia. Their vast estates were\r\nscattered along the rivers from the seacoast to the mountains. Each\r\nplantation was in itself a small village, with the owner's house in\r\nthe centre, surrounded by outbuildings and negro cabins, and the\r\npastures, meadows, and fields of tobacco stretching away on all sides.\r\nThe rare traveler, pursuing his devious way on horseback or in a boat,\r\nwould catch sight of these noble estates opening up from the road or\r\nthe river, and then the forest would close in around him for several\r\nmiles, until through the thinning trees he would see again the white\r\ncabins and the cleared fields of the next plantation.\r\n\r\nIn such places dwelt the Virginian planters, surrounded by their\r\nfamilies and slaves, and in a solitude broken only by the infrequent\r\nand eagerly welcomed stranger, by their duties as vestrymen and\r\nmagistrates, or by the annual pilgrimage to Williamsburg in search of\r\nsociety, or to sit in the House of Burgesses. They were occupied by\r\nthe care of their plantations, which involved a good deal of riding in\r\nthe open air, but which was at best an easy and indolent pursuit made\r\nlight by slave labor and trained overseers. As a result the planters\r\nhad an abundance of spare time, which they devoted to cock-fighting,\r\nhorse-racing, fishing, shooting, and fox-hunting,--all, save the\r\nfirst, wholesome and manly sports, but which did not demand any undue\r\nmental strain. There is, indeed, no indication that the Virginians\r\nhad any great love for intellectual exertion. When the amiable\r\nattorney-general of Charles II. said to the Virginian commissioners,\r\npleading the cause of learning and religion, \"Damn your souls! grow\r\ntobacco!\" he uttered a precept which the mass of the planters seem to\r\nhave laid to heart. For fifty years there were no schools, and down to\r\nthe Revolution even the apologies bearing that honored name were\r\nfew, and the college was small and struggling. In some of the great\r\nfamilies, the eldest sons would be sent to England and to the great\r\nuniversities: they would make the grand tour, play a part in the\r\nfashionable society of London, and come back to their plantations fine\r\ngentlemen and scholars. Such was Colonel Byrd, in the early part of\r\nthe eighteenth century, a friend of the Earl of Orrery, and the author\r\nof certain amusing memoirs. Such at a later day was Arthur Lee,\r\ndoctor and diplomat, student and politician. But most of these young\r\ngentlemen thus sent abroad to improve their minds and manners led a\r\nlife not materially different from that of our charming friend, Harry\r\nWarrington, after his arrival in England.\r\n\r\nThe sons who stayed at home sometimes gathered a little learning from\r\nthe clergyman of the parish, or received a fair education at the\r\nCollege of William and Mary, but very many did not have even so much\r\nas this. There was not in truth much use for learning in managing a\r\nplantation or raising horses, and men get along surprisingly well\r\nwithout that which they do not need, especially if the acquisition\r\ndemands labor. The Virginian planter thought little and read less,\r\nand there were no learned professions to hold out golden prizes and\r\nstimulate the love of knowledge. The women fared even worse, for\r\nthey could not go to Europe or to William and Mary's, so that after\r\nexhausting the teaching capacity of the parson they settled down to a\r\nround of household duties and to the cares of a multitude of slaves,\r\nworking much harder and more steadily than their lords and masters\r\never thought of doing.\r\n\r\nThe only general form of intellectual exertion was that of governing.\r\nThe planters managed local affairs through the vestries, and ruled\r\nVirginia in the House of Burgesses. To this work they paid strict\r\nattention, and, after the fashion of their race, did it very well and\r\nvery efficiently. They were an extremely competent body whenever they\r\nmade up their minds to do anything; but they liked the life and habits\r\nof Squire Western, and saw no reason for adopting any others until it\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, vast differences in the condition of the\r\nplanters. Some counted their acres by thousands and their slaves by\r\nhundreds, while others scrambled along as best they might with one\r\nplantation and a few score of negroes. Some dwelt in very handsome\r\nhouses, picturesque and beautiful, like Gunston Hall or Stratford, or\r\nin vast, tasteless, and extravagant piles like Rosewell. Others were\r\ncontented with very modest houses, consisting of one story with a\r\ngabled roof, and flanked by two massive chimneys. In some houses there\r\nwas a brave show of handsome plate and china, fine furniture, and\r\nLondon-made carriages, rich silks and satins, and brocaded dresses.\r\nIn others there were earthenware and pewter, homespun and woolen, and\r\nlittle use for horses, except in the plough or under the saddle.\r\n\r\nBut there were certain qualities common to all the Virginia planters.\r\nThe luxury was imperfect. The splendor was sometimes barbaric. There\r\nwere holes in the brocades, and the fresh air of heaven would often\r\nblow through a broken window upon the glittering silver and the costly\r\nchina. It was an easy-going aristocracy, unfinished, and frequently\r\nslovenly in its appointments, after the fashion of the warmer climates\r\nand the regions of slavery.\r\n\r\nEverything was plentiful except ready money. In this rich and poor\r\nwere alike. They were all ahead of their income, and it seems as if,\r\nfrom one cause or another, from extravagance or improvidence, from\r\nhorses or the gaming-table, every Virginian family went through\r\nbankruptcy about once in a generation.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry Warrington arrived in England, all his relations at\r\nCastlewood regarded the handsome young fellow as a prince, with his\r\nacres and his slaves. It was a natural and pleasing delusion, born of\r\nthe possession of land and serfs, to which the Virginians themselves\r\ngave ready credence. They forgot that the land was so plentiful that\r\nit was of little value; that slaves were the most wasteful form of\r\nlabor; and that a failure of the tobacco crop, pledged before it was\r\ngathered, meant ruin, although they had been reminded more than once\r\nof this last impressive fact. They knew that they had plenty to eat\r\nand drink, and a herd of people to wait upon them and cultivate their\r\nland, as well as obliging London merchants always ready to furnish\r\nevery luxury in return for the mortgage of a crop or an estate. So\r\nthey gave themselves little anxiety as to the future and lived in the\r\npresent, very much to their own satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTo the communities of trade and commerce, to the mercantile and\r\nindustrial spirit of to-day, such an existence and such modes of life\r\nappear distressingly lax and unprogressive. The sages of the bank\r\nparlors and the counting-rooms would shake their heads at such\r\nspendthrifts as these, refuse to discount their paper, and confidently\r\npredict that by no possibility could they come to good. They had their\r\ndefects, no doubt, these planters and farmers of Virginia. The life\r\nthey led was strongly developed on the animal side, and was perhaps\r\nneither stimulating nor elevating. The living was the reverse of\r\nplain, and the thinking was neither extremely high nor notably\r\nlaborious. Yet in this very particular there is something rather\r\nrestful and pleasant to the eye wearied by the sight of incessant\r\nmovement, and to the ear deafened by the continual shout that nothing\r\nis good that does not change, and that all change must be good. We\r\nshould probably find great discomforts and many unpleasant limitations\r\nin the life and habits of a hundred years ago on any part of the\r\nglobe, and yet at a time when it seems as if rapidity and movement\r\nwere the last words and the ultimate ideals of civilization, it is\r\nrather agreeable to turn to such a community as the eighteenth-century\r\nplanters of Virginia. They lived contentedly on the acres of their\r\nfathers, and except at rare and stated intervals they had no other\r\ninterests than those furnished by their ancestral domain. At the\r\ncourt-house, at the vestry, or in Williamsburg, they met their\r\nneighbors and talked very keenly about the politics of Europe, or the\r\naffairs of the colony. They were little troubled about religion, but\r\nthey worshiped after the fashion of their fathers, and had a serious\r\nfidelity to church and king. They wrangled with their governors over\r\nappropriations, but they lived on good terms with those eminent\r\npersons, and attended state balls at what they called the palace, and\r\ndanced and made merry with much stateliness and grace. Their every-day\r\nlife ran on in the quiet of their plantations as calmly as one of\r\ntheir own rivers. The English trader would come and go; the infrequent\r\nstranger would be received and welcomed; Christmas would be kept in\r\nhearty English fashion; young men from a neighboring estate would\r\nride over through the darkening woods to court, or dance, or play\r\nthe fiddle, like Patrick Henry or Thomas Jefferson; and these simple\r\nevents were all that made a ripple on the placid stream. Much time was\r\ngiven to sports, rough, hearty, manly sports, with a spice of danger,\r\nand these, with an occasional adventurous dash into the wilderness,\r\nkept them sound and strong and brave, both in body and mind. There was\r\nnothing languid or effeminate about the Virginian planter. He was a\r\nrobust man, quite ready to fight or work when the time came, and well\r\nfitted to deal with affairs when he was needed. He was a free-handed,\r\nhospitable, generous being, not much given to study or thought, but\r\nthoroughly public-spirited and keenly alive to the interests of\r\nVirginia. Above all things he was an aristocrat, set apart by the\r\ndark line of race, color, and hereditary servitude, as proud as the\r\nproudest Austrian with his endless quarterings, as sturdy and vigorous\r\nas an English yeoman, and as jealous of his rights and privileges\r\nas any baron who stood by John at Runnymede. To this aristocracy,\r\ncareless and indolent, given to rough pleasures and indifferent to the\r\nfiner and higher sides of life, the call came, as it comes to all men\r\nsooner or later, and in response they gave their country soldiers,\r\nstatesmen, and jurists of the highest order, and fit for the great\r\nwork they were asked to do. We must go back to Athens to find another\r\ninstance of a society so small in numbers, and yet capable of such an\r\noutburst of ability and force. They were of sound English stock, with\r\na slight admixture of the Huguenots, the best blood of France; and\r\nalthough for a century and a half they had seemed to stagnate in\r\nthe New World, they were strong, fruitful, and effective beyond the\r\nmeasure of ordinary races when the hour of peril and trial was at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WASHINGTONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the world and such the community which counted as a small\r\nfraction the Washington family. Our immediate concern is with that\r\nfamily, for before we approach the man we must know his ancestors. The\r\ngreatest leader of scientific thought in this century has come to\r\nthe aid of the genealogist, and given to the results of the latter's\r\nsomewhat discredited labors a vitality and meaning which it seemed\r\nimpossible that dry and dusty pedigrees and barren tables of descent\r\nshould ever possess. We have always selected our race-horses according\r\nto the doctrines of evolution, and we now study the character of a\r\ngreat man by examining first the history of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nWashington made so great an impression upon the world in his lifetime\r\nthat genealogists at once undertook for him the construction of a\r\nsuitable pedigree. The excellent Sir Isaac Heard, garter king-at-arms,\r\nworked out a genealogy which seemed reasonable enough, and then wrote\r\nto the president in relation to it. Washington in reply thanked him\r\nfor his politeness, sent him the Virginian genealogy of his own\r\nbranch, and after expressing a courteous interest said, in his simple\r\nand direct fashion, that he had been a busy man and had paid but\r\nlittle attention to the subject. His knowledge about his English\r\nforefathers was in fact extremely slight. He had heard merely that\r\nthe first of the name in Virginia had come from one of the northern\r\ncounties of England, but whether from Lancashire or Yorkshire, or one\r\nstill more northerly, he could not tell. Sir Isaac was not thoroughly\r\nsatisfied with the correctness of his own work, but presently Baker\r\ntook it up in his history of Northamptonshire, and perfected it to\r\nhis own satisfaction and that of the world in general. This genealogy\r\nderived Washington's descent from the owners of the manor of Sulgrave,\r\nin Northamptonshire, and thence carried it back to the Norman knight,\r\nSir William de Hertburn. According to this pedigree the Virginian\r\nsettlers, John and Lawrence, were the sons of Lawrence Washington of\r\nSulgrave Manor, and this genealogy was adopted by Sparks and Irving,\r\nas well as by the public at large. Twenty years ago, however, Colonel\r\nChester, by his researches, broke the most essential link in the chain\r\nforged by Heard and Baker, proving clearly that the Virginian settlers\r\ncould not have been the sons of Lawrence of Sulgrave, as identified by\r\nthe garter king-at-arms. Still more recently the mythical spirit has\r\ntaken violent possession of the Washington ancestry, and an ingenious\r\ngentleman has traced the pedigree of our first president back to\r\nThorfinn and thence to Odin, which is sufficiently remote, dignified,\r\nand lofty to satisfy the most exacting Welshman that ever lived. Still\r\nthe breach made by Colonel Chester was not repaired, although many\r\nwriters, including some who should have known better, clung with\r\nundiminished faith to the Heard pedigree. It was known that Colonel\r\nChester himself believed that he had found the true line, coming, it\r\nis supposed, through a younger branch of the Sulgrave race, but he\r\ndied before he had discovered the one bit of evidence necessary to\r\nprove an essential step, and he was too conscientiously accurate to\r\nleave anything to conjecture. Since then the researches of Mr. Henry\r\nE. Waters have established the pedigree of the Virginian Washingtons,\r\nand we are now able to know something of the men from whom George\r\nWashington drew his descent.\r\n\r\nIn that interesting land where everything, according to our narrow\r\nideas, is upside down, it is customary, when an individual arrives at\r\ndistinction, to confer nobility upon his ancestors instead of upon\r\nhis children. The Washingtons offer an interesting example of the\r\napplication of this Chinese system in the Western world, for, if they\r\nhave not been actually ennobled in recognition of the deeds of their\r\ngreat descendant, they have at least become the subjects of intense\r\nand general interest. Every one of the name who could be discovered\r\nanywhere has been dragged forth into the light, and has had all that\r\nwas known about him duly recorded and set down. By scanning family\r\ntrees and pedigrees, and picking up stray bits of information here and\r\nthere, we can learn in a rude and general fashion what manner of men\r\nthose were who claimed descent from William of Hertburn, and who bore\r\nthe name of Washington in the mother-country. As Mr. Galton passes\r\na hundred faces before the same highly sensitized plate, and gets a\r\nphotograph which is a likeness of no one of his subjects, and yet\r\nresembles them all, so we may turn the camera of history upon these\r\nWashingtons, as they flash up for a moment from the dim past, and hope\r\nto obtain what Professor Huxley calls a \"generic\" picture of the race,\r\neven if the outlines be somewhat blurred and indistinct.\r\n\r\nIn the North of England, in the region conquered first by Saxons and\r\nthen by Danes, lies the little village of Washington. It came into the\r\npossession of Sir William de Hertburn, and belonged to him at the time\r\nof the Boldon Book in 1183. Soon after, he or his descendants took\r\nthe name of De Wessyngton, and there they remained for two centuries,\r\nknights of the palatinate, holding their lands by a military tenure,\r\nfighting in all the wars, and taking part in tournaments with becoming\r\nsplendor. By the beginning of the fifteenth century the line of feudal\r\nknights of the palatinate was extinct, and the manor passed from the\r\nfamily by the marriage of Dionisia de Wessyngton. But the main stock\r\nhad in the mean time thrown out many offshoots, which had taken firm\r\nroot in other parts and in many counties of England. We hear of\r\nseveral who came in various ways to eminence. There was the learned\r\nand vigorous prior of Durham, John de Wessyngton, probably one of the\r\noriginal family, and the name appears in various places after his time\r\nin records and on monuments, indicating a flourishing and increasing\r\nrace. Lawrence Washington, the direct ancestor of the first President\r\nof the United States, was, in the sixteenth century, the mayor of\r\nNorthampton, and received from King Henry VIII. the manor of Sulgrave\r\nin 1538. In the next century we find traces of Robert Washington of\r\nthe Adwick family, a rich merchant of Leeds, and of his son Joseph\r\nWashington, a learned lawyer and author, of Gray's Inn. About the same\r\ntime we hear of Richard Washington and Philip Washington holding high\r\nplaces at University College, Oxford. The Sulgrave branch, however,\r\nwas the most numerous and prosperous. From the mayor of Northampton\r\nwere descended Sir William Washington, who married the half-sister of\r\nGeorge Villiers, Duke of Buckingham; Sir Henry Washington, who made a\r\ndesperate defense of Worcester against the forces of the Parliament in\r\n1646; Lieutenant-Colonel James Washington, who fell at the siege of\r\nPontefract, fighting for King Charles; another James, of a later time,\r\nwho was implicated in Monmouth's rebellion, fled to Holland and became\r\nthe progenitor of a flourishing and successful family, which has\r\nspread to Germany and there been ennobled; Sir Lawrence Washington, of\r\nGarsdon, whose grand-daughter married Robert Shirley, Baron Ferrers;\r\nand others of less note, but all men of property and standing. They\r\nseem to have been a successful, thrifty race, owning lands and\r\nestates, wise magistrates and good soldiers, marrying well, and\r\nincreasing their wealth and strength from generation to generation.\r\nThey were of Norman stock, knights and gentlemen in the full sense of\r\nthe word before the French Revolution, and we can detect in them here\r\nand there a marked strain of the old Norse blood, carrying with it\r\nacross the centuries the wild Berserker spirit which for centuries\r\nmade the adventurous Northmen the terror of Europe. They were a strong\r\nrace evidently, these Washingtons, whom we see now only by glimpses\r\nthrough the mists of time, not brilliant apparently, never winning the\r\nvery highest fortune, having their failures and reverses no doubt,\r\nbut on the whole prudent, bold men, always important in their several\r\nstations, ready to fight and ready to work, and as a rule successful\r\nin that which they set themselves to do.\r\n\r\nIn 1658 the two brothers, John and Lawrence, appeared in Virginia. As\r\nhas been proved by Mr. Waters, they were of the Sulgrave family,\r\nthe sons of Lawrence Washington, fifth son of the elder Lawrence of\r\nSulgrave and Brington. The father of the emigrants was a fellow of\r\nBrasenose College, Oxford, and rector of Purleigh, from which living\r\nhe was ejected by the Puritans as both \"scandalous\" and \"malignant.\"\r\nThat he was guilty of the former charge we may well doubt; but that he\r\nwas, in the language of the time, \"malignant,\" must be admitted, for\r\nall his family, including his brothers, Sir William Washington of\r\nPackington, and Sir John Washington of Thrapston, his nephew, Sir\r\nHenry Washington, and his nephew-in-law, William Legge, ancestor of\r\nthe Earl of Dartmouth, were strongly on the side of the king. In a\r\nmarriage which seems to have been regarded as beneath the dignity of\r\nthe family, and in the poverty consequent upon the ejectment from\r\nhis living, we can find the reason for the sons of the Rev. Lawrence\r\nWashington going forth into Virginia to find their fortune, and flying\r\nfrom the world of victorious Puritanism which offered just then so\r\nlittle hope to royalists like themselves. Yet what was poverty in\r\nEngland was something much more agreeable in the New World of America.\r\nThe emigrant brothers at all events seem to have had resources of a\r\nsufficient kind, and to have been men of substance, for they purchased\r\nlands and established themselves at Bridges Creek, in Westmoreland\r\nCounty. With this brief statement, Lawrence disappears, leaving us\r\nnothing further than the knowledge that he had numerous descendants.\r\nJohn, with whom we are more concerned, figures at once in the colonial\r\nrecords of Maryland. He made complaint to the Maryland authorities,\r\nsoon after his arrival, against Edward Prescott, merchant, and captain\r\nof the ship in which he had come over, for hanging a woman during the\r\nvoyage for witchcraft. We have a letter of his, explaining that he\r\ncould not appear at the first trial because he was about to baptize\r\nhis son, and had bidden the neighbors and gossips to the feast. A\r\nlittle incident this, dug out of the musty records, but it shows us an\r\nactive, generous man, intolerant of oppression, public-spirited and\r\nhospitable, social, and friendly in his new relations. He soon after\r\nwas called to mourn the death of his English wife and of two children,\r\nbut he speedily consoled himself by taking a second wife, Anne Pope,\r\nby whom he had three children, Lawrence, John, and Anne. According to\r\nthe Virginian tradition, John Washington the elder was a surveyor, and\r\nmade a location of lands which was set aside because they had been\r\nassigned to the Indians. It is quite apparent that he was a forehanded\r\nperson who acquired property and impressed himself upon his neighbors.\r\nIn 1667, when he had been but ten years in the colony, he was chosen\r\nto the House of Burgesses; and eight years later he was made a colonel\r\nand sent with a thousand men to join the Marylanders in destroying\r\nthe \"Susquehannocks,\" at the \"Piscataway\" fort, on account of some\r\nmurdering begun by another tribe. As a feat of arms, the expedition\r\nwas not a very brilliant affair. The Virginians and Marylanders killed\r\nhalf a dozen Indian chiefs during a parley, and then invested the\r\nfort. After repulsing several sorties, they stupidly allowed the\r\nIndians to escape in the night and carry murder and pillage through\r\nthe outlying settlements, lighting up first the flames of savage war\r\nand then the fiercer fire of domestic insurrection. In the next year\r\nwe hear again of John Washington in the House of Burgesses, when Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley assailed his troops for the murder of the Indians\r\nduring the parley. Popular feeling, however, was clearly with the\r\ncolonel, for nothing was done and the matter dropped. At that point,\r\ntoo, in 1676, John Washington disappears from sight, and we know only\r\nthat as his will was proved in 1677, he must have died soon after the\r\nscene with Berkeley. He was buried in the family vault at Bridges\r\nCreek, and left a good estate to be divided among his children. The\r\ncolonel was evidently both a prudent and popular man, and quite\r\ndisposed to bustle about in the world in which he found himself. He\r\nacquired lands, came to the front at once as a leader although a\r\nnew-comer in the country, was evidently a fighting man as is shown by\r\nhis selection to command the Virginian forces, and was honored by his\r\nneighbors, who gave his name to the parish in which he dwelt. Then\r\nhe died and his son Lawrence reigned in his stead, and became by his\r\nwife, Mildred Warner, the father of John, Augustine, and Mildred\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThis second son, Augustine, farmer and planter like his forefathers,\r\nmarried first Jane Butler, by whom he had three sons and a daughter,\r\nand second, Mary Ball, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. The\r\neldest child of these second nuptials was named George, and was born\r\non February 11 (O.S.), 1732, at Bridges Creek. The house in which\r\nthis event occurred was a plain, wooden farmhouse of the primitive\r\nVirginian pattern, with four rooms on the ground floor, an attic story\r\nwith a long, sloping roof, and a massive brick chimney. Three years\r\nafter George Washington's birth it is said to have been burned, and\r\nthe family for this or some other reason removed to another estate in\r\nwhat is now Stafford County. The second house was like the first, and\r\nstood on rising ground looking across a meadow to the Rappahannock,\r\nand beyond the river to the village of Fredericksburg, which was\r\nnearly opposite. Here, in 1743, Augustine Washington died somewhat\r\nsuddenly, at the age of forty-nine, from an attack of gout brought on\r\nby exposure in the rain, and was buried with his fathers in the old\r\nvault at Bridges Creek. Here, too, the boyhood of Washington was\r\npassed, and therefore it becomes necessary to look about us and see\r\nwhat we can learn of this important period of his life.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing about his father, except that he was kindly and\r\naffectionate, attached to his wife and children, and apparently\r\nabsorbed in the care of his estates. On his death the children came\r\nwholly under the maternal influence and direction. Much has been\r\nwritten about the \"mother of Washington,\" but as a matter of fact,\r\nalthough she lived to an advanced age, we know scarcely more about her\r\nthan we do about her husband. She was of gentle birth, and possessed\r\na vigorous character and a good deal of business capacity. The\r\nadvantages of education were given in but slight measure to the\r\nVirginian ladies of her time, and Mrs. Washington offered no exception\r\nto the general rule. Her reading was confined to a small number of\r\nvolumes, chiefly of a devotional character, her favorite apparently\r\nbeing Hale's \"Moral and Divine Contemplations.\" She evidently knew no\r\nlanguage but her own, and her spelling was extremely bad even in that\r\nage of uncertain orthography. Certain qualities, however, are clear to\r\nus even now through all the dimness. We can see that Mary Washington\r\nwas gifted with strong sense, and had the power of conducting business\r\nmatters providently and exactly. She was an imperious woman, of strong\r\nwill, ruling her kingdom alone. Above all she was very dignified, very\r\nsilent, and very sober-minded. That she was affectionate and loving\r\ncannot be doubted, for she retained to the last a profound hold upon\r\nthe reverential devotion of her son, and yet as he rose steadily to\r\nthe pinnacle of human greatness, she could only say that \"George\r\nhad been a good boy, and she was sure he would do his duty.\" Not a\r\nbrilliant woman evidently, not one suited to shine in courts, conduct\r\nintrigues, or adorn literature, yet able to transmit moral qualities\r\nto her oldest son, which, mingled with those of the Washingtons, were\r\nof infinite value in the foundation of a great Republic. She found\r\nherself a widow at an early age, with a family of young children to\r\neducate and support. Her means were narrow, for although Augustine\r\nWashington was able to leave what was called a landed estate to each\r\nson, it was little more than idle capital, and the income in ready\r\nmoney was by no means so evident as the acres.\r\n\r\nMany are the myths, and deplorably few the facts, that have come\r\ndown to us in regard to Washington's boyhood. For the former we are\r\nindebted to the illustrious Weems, and to that personage a few more\r\nwords must be devoted. Weems has been held up to the present age\r\nin various ways, usually, it must be confessed, of an unflattering\r\nnature, and \"mendacious\" is the adjective most commonly applied to\r\nhim. There has been in reality a good deal of needless confusion about\r\nWeems and his book, for he was not a complex character, and neither he\r\nnor his writings are difficult to value or understand. By profession a\r\nclergyman or preacher, by nature an adventurer, Weems loved notoriety,\r\nmoney, and a wandering life. So he wrote books which he correctly\r\nbelieved would be popular, and sold them not only through the regular\r\nchannels, but by peddling them himself as he traveled about the\r\ncountry. In this way he gratified all his propensities, and no doubt\r\nderived from life a good deal of simple pleasure. Chance brought him\r\nnear Washington in the closing days, and his commercial instinct\r\ntold him that here was the subject of all others for his pen and\r\nhis market. He accordingly produced the biography which had so much\r\nsuccess. Judged solely as literature, the book is beneath contempt.\r\nThe style is turgid, overloaded, and at times silly. The statements\r\nare loose, the mode of narration confused and incoherent, and the\r\nmoralizing is flat and common-place to the last degree. Yet there\r\nwas a certain sincerity of feeling underneath all the bombast and\r\nplatitudes, and this saved the book. The biography did not go, and was\r\nnot intended to go, into the hands of the polite society of the great\r\neastern towns. It was meant for the farmers, the pioneers, and the\r\nbackwoodsmen of the country. It went into their homes, and passed with\r\nthem beyond the Alleghanies and out to the plains and valleys of the\r\ngreat West. The very defects of the book helped it to success among\r\nthe simple, hard-working, hard-fighting race engaged in the conquest\r\nof the American continent. To them its heavy and tawdry style, its\r\nstaring morals, and its real patriotism all seemed eminently befitting\r\nthe national hero, and thus Weems created the Washington of the\r\npopular fancy. The idea grew up with the country, and became so\r\ningrained in the popular thought that finally everybody was affected\r\nby it, and even the most stately and solemn of the Washington\r\nbiographers adopted the unsupported tales of the itinerant parson and\r\nbook-peddler.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the public life of Washington, Weems took the facts known\r\nto every one, and drawn for the most part from the gazettes. He then\r\ndressed them up in his own peculiar fashion and gave them to the\r\nworld. All this, forming of course nine tenths of his book, has\r\npassed, despite its success, into oblivion. The remaining tenth\r\ndescribed Washington's boyhood until his fourteenth or fifteenth year,\r\nand this, which is the work of the author's imagination, has lived.\r\nWeems, having set himself up as absolutely the only authority as to\r\nthis period, has been implicitly followed, and has thus come to demand\r\nserious consideration. Until Weems is weighed and disposed of, we\r\ncannot even begin an attempt to get at the real Washington.\r\n\r\nWeems was not a cold-blooded liar, a mere forger of anecdotes. He was\r\nsimply a man destitute of historical sense, training, or morals, ready\r\nto take the slenderest fact and work it up for the purposes of the\r\nmarket until it became almost as impossible to reduce it to its\r\noriginal dimensions as it was for the fisherman to get the Afrit back\r\ninto his jar. In a word, Weems was an approved myth-maker. No better\r\nexample can be given than the way in which he described himself. It\r\nis believed that he preached once, and possibly oftener, to a\r\ncongregation which numbered Washington among its members. Thereupon he\r\npublished himself in his book as the rector of Mount Vernon parish.\r\nThere was, to begin with, no such parish. There was Truro parish, in\r\nwhich was a church called indifferently Pohick or Mount Vernon church.\r\nOf this church Washington was a vestryman until 1785, when he joined\r\nthe church at Alexandria. The Rev. Lee Massey was the clergyman of the\r\nMount Vernon church, and the church at Alexandria had nothing to do\r\nwith Mount Vernon. There never was, moreover, such a person as the\r\nrector of Mount Vernon parish, but it was the Weems way of treating\r\nhis appearance before the great man, and of deceiving the world with\r\nthe notion of an intimacy which the title implied.\r\n\r\nWeems, of course, had no difficulty with the public life, but in\r\ndescribing the boyhood he was thrown on his own resources, and out\r\nof them he evolved the cherry-tree, the refusal to fight or permit\r\nfighting among the boys at school, and the initials in the garden.\r\nThis last story is to the effect that Augustine Washington planted\r\nseeds in such a manner that when they sprouted they formed on the\r\nearth the initials of his son's name, and the boy being much delighted\r\nthereby, the father explained to him that it was the work of the\r\nCreator, and thus inculcated a profound belief in God. This tale\r\nis taken bodily from Dr. Beattie's biographical sketch of his son,\r\npublished in England in 1799, and may be dismissed at once. As to the\r\nother two more familiar anecdotes there is not a scintilla of evidence\r\nthat they had any foundation, and with them may be included the colt\r\nstory, told by Mr. Custis, a simple variation of the cherry-tree\r\ntheme, which is Washington's early love of truth. Weems says that\r\nhis stories were told him by a lady, and \"a good old gentleman,\" who\r\nremembered the incidents, while Mr. Custis gives no authority for his\r\nminute account of a trivial event over a century old when he wrote.\r\nTo a writer who invented the rector of Mount Vernon, the further\r\ninvention of a couple of Boswells would be a trifle. I say Boswells\r\nadvisedly, for these stories are told with the utmost minuteness, and\r\nthe conversations between Washington and his father are given as if\r\nfrom a stenographic report. How Mr. Custis, usually so accurate, came\r\nto be so far infected with the Weems myth as to tell the colt story\r\nafter the Weems manner, cannot now be determined. There can be no\r\ndoubt that Washington, like most healthy boys, got into a good deal of\r\nmischief, and it is not at all impossible that he injured fruit-trees\r\nand confessed that he had done so. It may be accepted as certain that\r\nhe rode and mastered many unbroken thoroughbred colts, and it is\r\npossible that one of them burst a blood-vessel in the process and\r\ndied, and that the boy promptly told his mother of the accident. But\r\nthis is the utmost credit which these two anecdotes can claim. Even so\r\nmuch as this cannot be said of certain other improving tales of like\r\nnature. That Washington lectured his playmates on the wickedness of\r\nfighting, and in the year 1754 allowed himself to be knocked down in\r\nthe presence of his soldiers, and thereupon begged his assailant's\r\npardon for having spoken roughly to him, are stories so silly and\r\nso foolishly impossible that they do not deserve an instant's\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing intrinsically impossible in either the cherry-tree or\r\nthe colt incident, nor would there be in a hundred others which might\r\nbe readily invented. The real point is that these stories, as told by\r\nWeems and Mr. Custis, are on their face hopelessly and ridiculously\r\nfalse. They are so, not merely because they have no vestige of\r\nevidence to support them, but because they are in every word and\r\nline the offspring of a period more than fifty years later. No\r\nEnglish-speaking people, certainly no Virginians, ever thought or\r\nbehaved or talked in 1740 like the personages in Weems's stories,\r\nwhatever they may have done in 1790, or at the beginning of the next\r\ncentury. These precious anecdotes belong to the age of Miss Edgeworth\r\nand Hannah More and Jane Taylor. They are engaging specimens of the\r\n\"Harry and Lucy\" and \"Purple Jar\" morality, and accurately reflect the\r\npale didacticism which became fashionable in England at the close of\r\nthe last century. They are as untrue to nature and to fact at the\r\nperiod to which they are assigned as would be efforts to depict\r\nAugustine Washington and his wife in the dress of the French\r\nrevolution discussing the propriety of worshiping the Goddess of\r\nReason.\r\n\r\nTo enter into any serious historical criticism of these stories would\r\nbe to break a butterfly. So much as this even has been said only\r\nbecause these wretched fables have gone throughout the world, and it\r\nis time that they were swept away into the dust-heaps of history. They\r\nrepresent Mr. and Mrs. Washington as affected and priggish people,\r\ngiven to cheap moralizing, and, what is far worse, they have served\r\nto place Washington himself in a ridiculous light to an age which has\r\noutgrown the educational foibles of seventy-five years ago. Augustine\r\nWashington and his wife were a gentleman and lady of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, living in Virginia. So far as we know without guessing or\r\nconjecture, they were simple, honest, and straight-forward, devoted to\r\nthe care of their family and estate, and doing their duty sensibly and\r\nafter the fashion of their time. Their son, to whom the greatest wrong\r\nhas been done, not only never did anything common or mean, but from\r\nthe beginning to the end of his life he was never for an instant\r\nridiculous or affected, and he was as utterly removed from canting\r\nor priggishness as any human being could well be. Let us therefore\r\nconsign the Weems stories and their offspring to the limbo of\r\nhistorical rubbish, and try to learn what the plain facts tell us of\r\nthe boy Washington.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these same facts are at first very few, so few that they\r\ntell us hardly anything. We know when and where Washington was born;\r\nand how, when he was little more than three years old,[1] he was taken\r\nfrom Bridges Creek to the banks of the Rappahannock. There he was\r\nplaced under the charge of one Hobby, the sexton of the parish, to\r\nlearn his alphabet and his pothooks; and when that worthy man's store\r\nof learning was exhausted he was sent back to Bridges Creek, soon\r\nafter his father's death, to live with his half-brother Augustine,\r\nand obtain the benefits of a school kept by a Mr. Williams. There he\r\nreceived what would now be called a fair common-school education,\r\nwholly destitute of any instruction in languages, ancient or modern,\r\nbut apparently with some mathematical training.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is a conflict about the period of this removal (see\r\nabove, p. 37). Tradition places it in 1735, but the Rev. Mr. McGuire\r\n(_Religious Opinions of Washington_) puts it in 1739.]\r\n\r\nThat he studied faithfully cannot be doubted, and we know, too, that\r\nhe matured early, and was a tall, active, and muscular boy. He could\r\noutwalk and outrun and outride any of his companions. As he could\r\nno doubt have thrashed any of them too, he was, in virtue of these\r\nqualities, which are respected everywhere by all wholesome minds, and\r\nespecially by boys, a leader among his school-fellows. We know further\r\nthat he was honest and true, and a lad of unusual promise, not because\r\nof the goody-goody anecdotes of the myth-makers, but because he\r\nwas liked and trusted by such men as his brother Lawrence and Lord\r\nFairfax.\r\n\r\nThere he was, at all events, in his fourteenth year, a big, strong,\r\nhearty boy, offering a serious problem to his mother, who was\r\nstruggling along with many acres, little money, and five children.\r\nMrs. Washington's chief desire naturally was to put George in the way\r\nof earning a living, which no doubt seemed far more important than\r\ngetting an education, and, as he was a sober-minded boy, the same idea\r\nwas probably profoundly impressed on his own mind also. This condition\r\nof domestic affairs led to the first attempt to give Washington a\r\nstart in life, which has been given to us until very lately in a\r\nsomewhat decorated form. The fact is, that in casting about for\r\nsomething to do, it occurred to some one, very likely to the boy\r\nhimself, that it would be a fine idea to go to sea. His masculine\r\nfriends and relatives urged the scheme upon Mrs. Washington, who\r\nconsented very reluctantly, if at all, not liking the notion of\r\nparting with her oldest son, even in her anxiety to have him earn his\r\nbread. When it came to the point, however, she finally decided against\r\nhis going, determined probably by a very sensible letter from her\r\nbrother, Joseph Ball, an English lawyer. In all the ornamented\r\nversions we are informed that the boy was to enter the royal navy,\r\nand that a midshipman's warrant was procured for him. There does not\r\nappear to be any valid authority for the royal navy, the warrant, or\r\nthe midshipman. The contemporary Virginian letters speak simply of\r\n\"going to sea,\" while Mr. Ball says distinctly that the plan was to\r\nenter the boy on a tobacco-ship, with an excellent chance of being\r\npressed on a man-of-war, and a very faint prospect of either getting\r\ninto the navy, or even rising to be the captain of one of the petty\r\ntrading-vessels familiar to Virginian planters. Some recent writers\r\nhave put Mr. Ball aside as not knowing what was intended in regard to\r\nhis nephew, but in view of the difficulty at that time of obtaining\r\ncommissions in the navy without great political influence, it seems\r\nprobable that Mrs. Washington's brother knew very well what he was\r\ntalking about, and he certainly wrote a very sensible letter. A bold,\r\nadventurous boy, eager to earn his living and make his way in the\r\nworld, would, like many others before him, look longingly to the sea\r\nas the highway to fortune and success. To Washington the romance of\r\nthe sea was represented by the tobacco-ship creeping up the river and\r\nbringing all the luxuries and many of the necessaries of life from\r\nvaguely distant countries. No doubt he wished to go on one of these\r\nvessels and try his luck, and very possibly the royal navy was hoped\r\nfor as the ultimate result. The effort was certainly made to send\r\nhim to sea, but it failed, and he went back to school to study more\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that the exact sciences in moderate degree were\r\nabout all that Mr. Williams could teach, this branch of learning had\r\nan immediate practical value, inasmuch as surveying was almost the\r\nonly immediately gainful pursuit open to a young Virginia gentleman,\r\nwho sorely needed a little ready money that he might buy slaves and\r\nwork a plantation. So Washington studied on for two years more, and\r\nfitted himself to be a surveyor. There are still extant some early\r\npapers belonging to this period, chiefly fragments of school\r\nexercises, which show that he already wrote the bold, handsome\r\nhand with which the world was to become familiar, and that he made\r\ngeometrical figures and notes of surveys with the neatness and\r\naccuracy which clung to him in all the work of his life, whether great\r\nor small. Among those papers, too, were found many copies of legal\r\nforms, and a set of rules, over a hundred in number, as to etiquette\r\nand behavior, carefully written out. It has always been supposed that\r\nthese rules were copied, but it was reserved apparently for the storms\r\nof a mighty civil war to lay bare what may have been, if not the\r\nsource of the rules themselves, the origin and suggestion of their\r\ncompilation. At that time a little volume was found in Virginia\r\nbearing the name of George Washington in a boyish hand on the\r\nfly-leaf, and the date 1742. The book was entitled, \"The Young Man's\r\nCompanion.\" It was an English work, and had passed through thirteen\r\neditions, which was little enough in view of its varied and extensive\r\ninformation. It was written by W. Mather, in a plain and easy style,\r\nand treated of arithmetic, surveying, forms for legal documents, the\r\nmeasuring of land and lumber, gardening, and many other useful topics,\r\nand it contained general precepts which, with the aid of Hale's\r\n\"Contemplations,\" may readily have furnished the hints for the rules\r\nfound in manuscript among Washington's papers.[1] These rules were in\r\nthe main wise and sensible, and it is evident they had occupied deeply\r\nthe boy's mind.[2] They are for the most part concerned with the\r\ncommonplaces of etiquette and good manners, but there is something not\r\nonly apt but quite prophetic in the last one, \"Labor to keep alive in\r\nyour breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.\" To\r\nsuppose that Washington's character was formed by these sententious\r\nbits of not very profound wisdom would be absurd; but that a series of\r\nrules which most lads would have regarded as simply dull should have\r\nbeen written out and pondered by this boy indicates a soberness and\r\nthoughtfulness of mind which certainly are not usual at that age.\r\nThe chief thought that runs through all the sayings is to practice\r\nself-control, and no man ever displayed that most difficult of virtues\r\nto such a degree as George Washington. It was no ordinary boy who took\r\nsuch a lesson as this to heart before he was fifteen, and carried it\r\ninto his daily life, never to be forgotten. It may also be said that\r\nvery few boys ever needed it more; but those persons who know what\r\nthey chiefly need, and pursue it, are by no means common.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An account of this volume was given in the _New York\r\nTribune_ in 1866, and also in the _Historical Magazine_ (x. 47).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The most important are given in Sparks' _Writings of\r\nWashington_, ii. 412, and they may be found complete in the little\r\npamphlet concerning them, excellently edited by Dr. J.M. Toner, of\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nON THE FRONTIER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Washington was working his way through the learning purveyed\r\nby Mr. Williams, he was also receiving another education, of a much\r\nbroader and better sort, from the men and women among whom he found\r\nhimself, and with whom he made friends. Chief among them was his\r\neldest brother, Lawrence, fourteen years his senior, who had been\r\neducated in England, had fought with Vernon at Carthagena, and had\r\nthen returned to Virginia, to be to him a generous father and a loving\r\nfriend. As the head of the family, Lawrence Washington had received\r\nthe lion's share of the property, including the estate at Hunting\r\nCreek, on the Potomac, which he christened Mount Vernon, after his\r\nadmiral, and where he settled down and built him a goodly house. To\r\nthis pleasant spot George Washington journeyed often in vacation\r\ntime, and there he came to live and further pursue his studies, after\r\nleaving school in the autumn of 1747.\r\n\r\nLawrence Washington had married the daughter of William Fairfax, the\r\nproprietor of Belvoir, a neighboring plantation, and the agent for\r\nthe vast estates held by his family in Virginia. George Fairfax, Mrs.\r\nWashington's brother, had married a Miss Gary, and thus two large and\r\nagreeable family connections were thrown open to the young surveyor\r\nwhen he emerged from school. The chief figure, however, in that\r\npleasant winter of 1747-48, so far as an influence upon the character\r\nof Washington is concerned, was the head of the family into which\r\nLawrence Washington had married. Thomas, Lord Fairfax, then sixty\r\nyears of age, had come to Virginia to live upon and look after the\r\nkingdom which he had inherited in the wilderness. He came of a noble\r\nand distinguished race. Graduating at Oxford with credit, he served in\r\nthe army, dabbled in literature, had his fling in the London world,\r\nand was jilted by a beauty who preferred a duke, and gave her faithful\r\nbut less titled lover an apparently incurable wound. His life having\r\nbeen thus early twisted and set awry, Lord Fairfax, when well past his\r\nprime, had determined finally to come to Virginia, bury himself in the\r\nforests, and look after the almost limitless possessions beyond the\r\nBlue Ridge, which he had inherited from his maternal grandfather, Lord\r\nCulpeper, of unsavory Restoration memory. It was a piece of great\r\ngood-fortune which threw in Washington's path this accomplished\r\ngentleman, familiar with courts and camps, disappointed, but not\r\nmorose, disillusioned, but still kindly and generous. From him the boy\r\ncould gain that knowledge of men and manners which no school can give,\r\nand which is as important in its way as any that a teacher can impart.\r\n\r\nLord Fairfax and Washington became fast friends. They hunted the fox\r\ntogether, and hunted him hard. They engaged in all the rough sports\r\nand perilous excitements which Virginia winter life could afford, and\r\nthe boy's bold and skillful riding, his love of sports and his fine\r\ntemper, commended him to the warm and affectionate interest of the old\r\nnobleman. Other qualities, too, the experienced man of the world saw\r\nin his young companion: a high and persistent courage, robust and calm\r\nsense, and, above all, unusual force of will and character. Washington\r\nimpressed profoundly everybody with whom he was brought into personal\r\ncontact, a fact which is one of the most marked features of his\r\ncharacter and career, and one which deserves study more than almost\r\nany other. Lord Fairfax was no exception to the rule. He saw in\r\nWashington not simply a promising, brave, open-hearted boy, diligent\r\nin practicing his profession, and whom he was anxious to help, but\r\nsomething more; something which so impressed him that he confided to\r\nthis lad a task which, according to its performance, would affect both\r\nhis fortune and his peace. In a word, he trusted Washington, and told\r\nhim, as the spring of 1748 was opening, to go forth and survey the\r\nvast Fairfax estates beyond the Ridge, define their boundaries, and\r\nsave them from future litigation. With this commission from Lord\r\nFairfax, Washington entered on the first period of his career. He\r\npassed it on the frontier, fighting nature, the Indians, and the\r\nFrench. He went in a schoolboy; he came out the first soldier in the\r\ncolonies, and one of the leading men of Virginia. Let us pause a\r\nmoment and look at him as he stands on the threshold of this momentous\r\nperiod, rightly called momentous because it was the formative period\r\nin the life of such a man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAWRENCE WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nHe had just passed his sixteenth birthday. He was tall and muscular,\r\napproaching the stature of more than six feet which he afterwards\r\nattained. He was not yet filled out to manly proportions, but was\r\nrather spare, after the fashion of youth. He had a well-shaped,\r\nactive figure, symmetrical except for the unusual length of the arms,\r\nindicating uncommon strength. His light brown hair was drawn back from\r\na broad forehead, and grayish-blue eyes looked happily, and perhaps a\r\ntrifle soberly, on the pleasant Virginia world about him. The face was\r\nopen and manly, with a square, massive jaw, and a general expression\r\nof calmness and strength. \"Fair and florid,\" big and strong, he was,\r\ntake him for all in all, as fine a specimen of his race as could be\r\nfound in the English colonies.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little closer through the keen eyes of one who studied\r\nmany faces to good purpose. The great painter of portraits, Gilbert\r\nStuart, tells us of Washington that he never saw in any man such large\r\neye-sockets, or such a breadth of nose and forehead between the\r\neyes, and that he read there the evidences of the strongest passions\r\npossible to human nature. John Bernard the actor, a good observer,\r\ntoo, saw in Washington's face, in 1797, the signs of an habitual\r\nconflict and mastery of passions, witnessed by the compressed mouth\r\nand deeply indented brow. The problem had been solved then; but in\r\n1748, passion and will alike slumbered, and no man could tell which\r\nwould prevail, or whether they would work together to great purpose\r\nor go jarring on to nothingness. He rises up to us out of the past in\r\nthat early springtime a fine, handsome, athletic boy, beloved by those\r\nabout him, who found him a charming companion and did not guess that\r\nhe might be a terribly dangerous foe. He rises up instinct with life\r\nand strength, a being capable, as we know, of great things whether for\r\ngood or evil, with hot blood pulsing in his veins and beating in his\r\nheart, with violent passions and relentless will still undeveloped;\r\nand no one in all that jolly, generous Virginian society even dimly\r\ndreamed what that development would be, or what it would mean to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt was in March, 1748, that George Fairfax and Washington set forth on\r\ntheir adventures, and passing through Ashby's Gap in the Blue Ridge,\r\nentered the valley of Virginia. Thence they worked their way up the\r\nvalley of the Shenandoah, surveying as they went, returned and swam\r\nthe swollen Potomac, surveyed the lands about its south branch and in\r\nthe mountainous region of Frederick County, and finally reached Mount\r\nVernon again on April 12. It was a rough experience for a beginner,\r\nbut a wholesome one, and furnished the usual vicissitudes of frontier\r\nlife. They were wet, cold, and hungry, or warm, dry, and well fed, by\r\nturns. They slept in a tent, or the huts of the scattered settlers,\r\nand oftener still beneath the stars. They met a war party of Indians,\r\nand having plied them with liquor, watched one of their mad dances\r\nround the camp-fire. In another place they came on a straggling\r\nsettlement of Germans, dull, patient, and illiterate, strangely unfit\r\nfor the life of the wilderness. All these things, as well as the\r\nprogress of their work and their various resting-places, Washington\r\nnoted down briefly but methodically in a diary, showing in these rough\r\nnotes the first evidences of that keen observation of nature and men\r\nand of daily incidents which he developed to such good purpose in\r\nafter-life. There are no rhapsodies and no reflections in these hasty\r\njottings, but the employments and the discomforts are all set down in\r\na simple and matter-of-fact way, which omitted no essential thing and\r\nexcluded all that was worthless. His work, too, was well done, and\r\nLord Fairfax was so much pleased by the report that he moved across\r\nthe Blue Ridge, built a hunting lodge preparatory to something more\r\nsplendid which never came to pass, and laid out a noble manor, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of Greenway Court. He also procured for\r\nWashington an appointment as a public surveyor, which conferred\r\nauthority on his surveys and provided him with regular work. Thus\r\nstarted, Washington toiled at his profession for three years, living\r\nand working as he did on his first expedition. It was a rough life,\r\nbut a manly and robust one, and the men who live it, although often\r\nrude and coarse, are never weak or effeminate. To Washington it was\r\nan admirable school. It strengthened his muscles and hardened him to\r\nexposure and fatigue. It accustomed him to risks and perils of various\r\nkinds, and made him fertile in expedients and confident of himself,\r\nwhile the nature of his work rendered him careful and industrious.\r\nThat his work was well done is shown by the fact that his surveys were\r\nconsidered of the first authority, and stand unquestioned to this day,\r\nlike certain other work which he was subsequently called to do. It was\r\npart of his character, when he did anything, to do it in a lasting\r\nfashion, and it is worth while to remember that the surveys he made as\r\na boy were the best that could be made.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to a friend at this time: \"Since you received my letter of\r\nOctober last, I have not slept above three or four nights in a bed,\r\nbut, after walking a good deal all the day, I have lain down before\r\nthe fire upon a little hay, straw, fodder, or a bearskin, whichever\r\nwas to be had, with man, wife, and children, like dogs and cats; and\r\nhappy is he who gets the berth nearest the fire. Nothing would make it\r\npass off tolerably but a good reward. A doubloon is my constant gain\r\nevery day that the weather will permit of my going out, and sometimes\r\nsix pistoles.\" He was evidently a thrifty lad, and honestly pleased\r\nwith honest earnings. He was no mere adventurous wanderer, but a man\r\nworking for results in money, reputation, or some solid value,\r\nand while he worked and earned he kept an observant eye upon the\r\nwilderness, and bought up when he could the best land for himself and\r\nhis family, laying the foundations of the great landed estate of which\r\nhe died possessed.\r\n\r\nThere was also a lighter and pleasanter side to this hard-working\r\nexistence, which was quite as useful, and more attractive, than\r\ntoiling in the woods and mountains. The young surveyor passed much of\r\nhis time at Greenway Court, hunting the fox and rejoicing in all field\r\nsports which held high place in that kingdom, while at the same time\r\nhe profited much in graver fashion by his friendship with such a man\r\nas Lord Fairfax. There, too, he had a chance at a library, and his\r\ndiaries show that he read carefully the history of England and the\r\nessays of the \"Spectator.\" Neither in early days nor at any other time\r\nwas he a student, for he had few opportunities, and his life from the\r\nbeginning was out of doors and among men. But the idea sometimes put\r\nforward that Washington cared nothing for reading or for books is an\r\nidle one. He read at Greenway Court and everywhere else when he had an\r\nopportunity. He read well, too, and to some purpose, studying men and\r\nevents in books as he did in the world, for though he never talked of\r\nhis reading, preserving silence on that as on other things concerning\r\nhimself, no one ever was able to record an instance in which he showed\r\nhimself ignorant of history or of literature. He was never a learned\r\nman, but so far as his own language could carry him he was an educated\r\none. Thus while he developed the sterner qualities by hard work and a\r\nrough life, he did not bring back the coarse habits of the backwoods\r\nand the camp-fire, but was able to refine his manners and improve his\r\nmind in the excellent society and under the hospitable roof of Lord\r\nFairfax.\r\n\r\nThree years slipped by, and then a domestic change came which much\r\naffected Washington's whole life. The Carthagena campaign had\r\nundermined the strength of Lawrence Washington and sown the seeds of\r\nconsumption, which showed itself in 1749, and became steadily more\r\nalarming. A voyage to England and a summer at the warm springs were\r\ntried without success, and finally, as a last resort, the invalid\r\nsailed for the West Indies, in September, 1751. Thither his brother\r\nGeorge accompanied him, and we have the fragments of a diary kept\r\nduring this first and last wandering outside his native country. He\r\ncopied the log, noted the weather, and evidently strove to get some\r\nidea of nautical matters while he was at sea and leading a life\r\nstrangely unfamiliar to a woodsman and pioneer. When they arrived at\r\ntheir destination they were immediately asked to breakfast and dine\r\nwith Major Clarke, the military magnate of the place, and our young\r\nVirginian remarked, with characteristic prudence and a certain touch\r\nof grim humor, \"We went,--myself with some reluctance, as the smallpox\r\nwas in the family.\" He fell a victim to his good manners, for two\r\nweeks later he was \"strongly attacked with the smallpox,\" and was\r\nthen housed for a month, getting safely and successfully through\r\nthis dangerous and then almost universal ordeal. Before the disease\r\ndeclared itself, however, he went about everywhere, innocently\r\nscattering infection, and greatly enjoying the pleasures of the\r\nisland. It is to be regretted that any part of this diary should have\r\nbeen lost, for it is pleasant reading, and exhibits the writer in an\r\nagreeable and characteristic fashion. He commented on the country and\r\nthe scenery, inveighed against the extravagance of the charges for\r\nboard and lodging, told of his dinner-parties and his friends, and\r\nnoted the marvelous abundance and variety of the tropical fruits,\r\nwhich contrasted strangely with the British dishes of beefsteak and\r\ntripe. He also mentioned being treated to a ticket to see the play of\r\n\"George Barnwell,\" on which he offered this cautious criticism:\r\n\"The character of Barnwell and several others were said to be well\r\nperformed. There was music adapted and regularly conducted.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after his recovery Washington returned to Virginia, arriving\r\nthere in February, 1752. The diary concluded with a brief but\r\nperfectly effective description of Barbadoes, touching on its\r\nresources and scenery, its government and condition, and the manners\r\nand customs of its inhabitants. All through these notes we find the\r\nkeenly observant spirit, and the evidence of a mind constantly alert\r\nto learn. We see also a pleasant, happy temperament, enjoying with\r\nhearty zest all the pleasures that youth and life could furnish. He\r\nwho wrote these lines was evidently a vigorous, good-humored young\r\nfellow, with a quick eye for the world opening before him, and for the\r\ndelights as well as the instruction which it offered.\r\n\r\nFrom the sunshine and ease of this tropical winter Washington passed\r\nto a long season of trial and responsibility at home and abroad. In\r\nJuly, 1752, his much-loved brother Lawrence died, leaving George\r\nguardian of his daughter, and heir to his estates in the event of\r\nthat daughter's death. Thus the current of his home life changed, and\r\nresponsibility came into it, while outside the mighty stream of public\r\nevents changed too, and swept him along in the swelling torrent of a\r\nworld-wide war.\r\n\r\nIn all the vast wilderness beyond the mountains there was not room for\r\nboth French and English. The rival nations had been for years slowly\r\napproaching each other, until in 1749 each people proceeded at last to\r\ntake possession of the Ohio country after its own fashion. The French\r\nsent a military expedition which sank and nailed up leaden plates; the\r\nEnglish formed a great land company to speculate and make money, and\r\nboth set diligently to work to form Indian alliances. A man of far\r\nless perception than Lawrence Washington, who had become the chief\r\nmanager of the Ohio Company, would have seen that the conditions on\r\nthe frontier rendered war inevitable, and he accordingly made ready\r\nfor the future by preparing his brother for the career of a soldier,\r\nso far as it could be done. He brought to Mount Vernon two old\r\ncompanions-in-arms of the Carthagena time, Adjutant Muse, a Virginian,\r\nand Jacob Van Braam, a Dutch soldier of fortune. The former instructed\r\nWashington in the art of war, tactics, and the manual of arms, the\r\nlatter in fencing and the sword exercise. At the same time Lawrence\r\nWashington procured for his brother, then only nineteen years of age,\r\nan appointment as one of the adjutants-general of Virginia, with the\r\nrank of major. To all this the young surveyor took kindly enough so\r\nfar as we can tell, but his military avocations were interrupted by\r\nhis voyage to Barbadoes, by the illness and death of his brother, and\r\nby the cares and responsibilities thereby thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nMeantime the French aggressions had continued, and French soldiers and\r\ntraders were working their way up from the South and down from the\r\nNorth, bullying and cajoling the Indians by turns, taking possession\r\nof the Ohio country, and selecting places as they went for that\r\nchain of forts which was to hem in and slowly strangle the English\r\nsettlements. Governor Dinwiddie had sent a commissioner to remonstrate\r\nagainst these encroachments, but his envoy had stopped a hundred\r\nand fifty miles short of the French posts, alarmed by the troublous\r\ncondition of things, and by the defeat and slaughter which the\r\nFrenchmen had already inflicted upon the Indians. Some more vigorous\r\nperson was evidently needed to go through the form of warning France\r\nnot to trespass on the English wilderness, and thereupon Governor\r\nDinwiddie selected for the task George Washington, recently\r\nreappointed adjutant-general of the northern division, and major in\r\nthe Virginian forces. He was a young man for such an undertaking, not\r\nyet twenty-two, but clearly of good reputation. It is plain enough\r\nthat Lord Fairfax and others had said to the governor, \"Here is the\r\nvery man for you; young, daring, and adventurous, but yet sober-minded\r\nand responsible, who only lacks opportunity to show the stuff that is\r\nin him.\"\r\n\r\nThus, then, in October, 1753, Washington set forth with Van Braam, and\r\nvarious servants and horses, accompanied by the boldest of Virginian\r\nfrontiersmen, Christopher Gist. He wrote a report in the form of a\r\njournal, which was sent to England and much read at the time as part\r\nof the news of the day, and which has an equal although different\r\ninterest now. It is a succinct, clear, and sober narrative. The little\r\nparty was formed at Will's Creek, and thence through woods and over\r\nswollen rivers made its way to Logstown. Here they spent some days\r\namong the Indians, whose leaders Washington got within his grasp after\r\nmuch speech-making; and here, too, he met some French deserters from\r\nthe South, and drew from them all the knowledge they possessed of New\r\nOrleans and the military expeditions from that region. From Logstown\r\nhe pushed on, accompanied by his Indian chiefs, to Venango, on the\r\nOhio, the first French outpost. The French officers asked him to sup\r\nwith them. The wine flowed freely, the tongues of the hosts were\r\nloosened, and the young Virginian, temperate and hard-headed, listened\r\nto all the conversation, and noted down mentally much that was\r\ninteresting and valuable. The next morning the Indian chiefs,\r\nprudently kept in the background, appeared, and a struggle ensued\r\nbetween the talkative, clever Frenchmen and the quiet, persistent\r\nVirginian, over the possession of these important savages. Finally\r\nWashington got off, carrying his chiefs with him, and made his way\r\nseventy miles further to the fort on French Creek. Here he delivered\r\nthe governor's letter, and while M. de St. Pierre wrote a vague and\r\npolite answer, he sketched the fort and informed himself in regard to\r\nthe military condition of the post. Then came another struggle over\r\nthe Indians, and finally Washington got off with them once more, and\r\nworked his way back to Venango. Another struggle for the savages\r\nfollowed, rum being always the principal factor in the negotiation,\r\nand at last the chiefs determined to stay behind. Nevertheless, the\r\nwork had been well done, and the important Half-King remained true to\r\nthe English cause.\r\n\r\nLeaving his horses, Washington and Gist then took to the woods on\r\nfoot. The French Indians lay in wait for them and tried to murder\r\nthem, and Gist, like a true frontiersman, was for shooting the\r\nscoundrel whom they captured. But Washington stayed his hand, and\r\nthey gave the savage the slip and pressed on. It was the middle of\r\nDecember, very cold and stormy. In crossing a river, Washington fell\r\nfrom the raft into deep water, amid the floating ice, but fought his\r\nway out, and he and his companion passed the night on an island, with\r\ntheir clothes frozen upon them. So through peril and privation, and\r\nvarious dangers, stopping in the midst of it all to win another savage\r\npotentate, they reached the edge of the settlements and thence went\r\non to Williamsburg, where great praise and glory were awarded to the\r\nyouthful envoy, the hero of the hour in the little Virginia capital.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to pause over this expedition a moment and to\r\nconsider attentively this journal which recounts it, for there are\r\nvery few incidents or documents which tell us more of Washington. He\r\nwas not yet twenty-two when he faced this first grave responsibility,\r\nand he did his work absolutely well. Cool courage, of course, he\r\nshowed, but also patience and wisdom in handling the Indians, a clear\r\nsense that the crafty and well-trained Frenchmen could not blind, and\r\na strong faculty for dealing with men, always a rare and precious\r\ngift. As in the little Barbadoes diary, so also in this journal,\r\nwe see, and far more strongly, the penetration and perception that\r\nnothing could escape, and which set down all things essential and let\r\nthe \"huddling silver, little worth,\" go by. The clearness, terseness,\r\nand entire sufficiency of the narrative are obvious and lie on the\r\nsurface; but we find also another quality of the man which is one of\r\nthe most marked features in his character, and one which we must dwell\r\nupon again and again, as we follow the story of his life. Here it\r\nis that we learn directly for the first time that Washington was a\r\nprofoundly silent man. The gospel of silence has been preached in\r\nthese latter days by Carlyle, with the fervor of a seer and prophet,\r\nand the world owes him a debt for the historical discredit which he\r\nhas brought upon the man of mere words as compared with the man of\r\ndeeds. Carlyle brushed Washington aside as \"a bloodless Cromwell,\" a\r\nphrase to which we must revert later on other grounds, and, as\r\nhas already been said, failed utterly to see that he was the most\r\nsupremely silent of the great men of action that the world can show.\r\nLike Cromwell and Frederic, Washington wrote countless letters, made\r\nmany speeches, and was agreeable in conversation. But this was all in\r\nthe way of business, and a man may be profoundly silent and yet talk a\r\ngreat deal. Silence in the fine and true sense is neither mere holding\r\nof the tongue nor an incapacity of expression. The greatly silent man\r\nis he who is not given to words for their own sake, and who never\r\ntalks about himself. Both Cromwell, greatest of Englishmen, and the\r\ngreat Frederic, Carlyle's especial heroes, were fond of talking of\r\nthemselves. So in still larger measure was Napoleon, and many others\r\nof less importance. But Washington differs from them all. He had\r\nabundant power of words, and could use them with much force and point\r\nwhen he was so minded, but he never used them needlessly or to hide\r\nhis meaning, and he never talked about himself. Hence the inestimable\r\ndifficulty of knowing him. A brief sentence here and there, a rare\r\ngleam of light across the page of a letter, is all that we can find.\r\nThe rest is silence. He did as great work as has fallen to the lot of\r\nman, he wrote volumes of correspondence, he talked with innumerable\r\nmen and women, and of himself he said nothing. Here in this youthful\r\njournal we have a narrative of wild adventure, wily diplomacy, and\r\npersonal peril, impossible of condensation, and yet not a word of the\r\nwriter's thoughts or feelings. All that was done or said important to\r\nthe business in hand was set down, and nothing was overlooked, but\r\nthat is all. The work was done, and we know how it was done, but the\r\nman is silent as to all else. Here, indeed, is the man of action and\r\nof real silence, a character to be much admired and wondered at in\r\nthese or any other days.\r\n\r\nWashington's report looked like war, and its author was shortly\r\nafterwards appointed lieutenant-colonel of a Virginian regiment,\r\nColonel Fry commanding. Now began that long experience of human\r\nstupidity and inefficiency with which Washington was destined to\r\nstruggle through all the years of his military career, suffering from\r\nthem, and triumphing in spite of them to a degree unequaled by any\r\nother great commander. Dinwiddie, the Scotch governor, was eager\r\nenough to fight, and full of energy and good intentions, but he was\r\nhasty and not overwise, and was filled with an excessive idea of his\r\nprerogatives. The assembly, on its side, was sufficiently patriotic,\r\nbut its members came from a community which for more than half a\r\ncentury had had no fighting, and they knew nothing of war or its\r\nnecessities. Unaccustomed to the large affairs into which they were\r\nsuddenly plunged, they displayed a narrow and provincial spirit.\r\nKeenly alive to their own rights and privileges, they were more\r\noccupied in quarreling with Dinwiddie than in prosecuting the war. In\r\nthe weak proprietary governments of Maryland and Pennsylvania there\r\nwas the same condition of affairs, with every evil exaggerated\r\ntenfold. The fighting spirit was dominant in Virginia, but in\r\nQuaker-ridden Pennsylvania it seems to have been almost extinct. These\r\nthree were not very promising communities to look to for support in a\r\ndifficult and costly war.\r\n\r\nWith all this inertia and stupidity Washington was called to cope, and\r\nhe rebelled against it in vigorous fashion. Leaving Colonel Fry to\r\nfollow with the main body of troops, Washington set out on April 2,\r\n1754, with two companies from Alexandria, where he had been recruiting\r\namidst most irritating difficulties. He reached Will's Creek three\r\nweeks later; and then his real troubles began. Captain Trent, the\r\ntimid and halting envoy, who had failed to reach the French, had been\r\nsent out by the wise authorities to build a fort at the junction of\r\nthe Alleghany and Monongahela, on the admirable site selected by the\r\nkeen eye of Washington. There Trent left his men and returned to\r\nWill's Creek, where Washington found him, but without the pack-horses\r\nthat he had promised to provide. Presently news came that the French\r\nin overwhelming numbers had swept down upon Trent's little party,\r\ncaptured their fort, and sent them packing back to Virginia.\r\nWashington took this to be war, and determined at once to march\r\nagainst the enemy. Having impressed from the inhabitants, who were not\r\nbubbling over with patriotism, some horses and wagons, he set out on\r\nhis toilsome march across the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild and desolate region, and progress was extremely slow.\r\nBy May 9 he was at the Little Meadows, twenty miles from his\r\nstarting-place; by the 18th at the Youghiogany River, which he\r\nexplored and found unnavigable. He was therefore forced to take up his\r\nweary march again for the Monongahela, and by the 27th he was at the\r\nGreat Meadows, a few miles further on. The extreme danger of his\r\nposition does not seem to have occurred to him, but he was harassed\r\nand angered by the conduct of the assembly. He wrote to Governor\r\nDinwiddie that he had no idea of giving up his commission. \"But,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"let me serve voluntarily; then I will, with the greatest\r\npleasure in life, devote my services to the expedition, without any\r\nother reward than the satisfaction of serving my country; but to be\r\nslaving dangerously for the shadow of pay, through woods, rocks,\r\nmountains,--I would rather prefer the great toil of a daily laborer,\r\nand dig for a maintenance, provided I were reduced to the necessity,\r\nthan serve upon such ignoble terms; for I really do not see why the\r\nlives of his Majesty's subjects in Virginia should be of less value\r\nthan those in other parts of his American dominions, especially when\r\nit is well known that we must undergo double their hardship.\" Here we\r\nhave a high-spirited, high-tempered young gentleman, with a contempt\r\nfor shams that it is pleasant to see, and evidently endowed also with\r\na fine taste for fighting and not too much patience.\r\n\r\nIndignant letters written in vigorous language were, however, of\r\nlittle avail, and Washington prepared to shift for himself as best he\r\nmight. His Indian allies brought him news that the French were on the\r\nmarch and had thrown out scouting parties. Picking out a place in the\r\nGreat Meadows for a fort, \"a charming field for an encounter,\" he in\r\nhis turn sent out a scouting party, and then on fresh intelligence\r\nfrom the Indians set forth himself with forty men to find the enemy.\r\nAfter a toilsome march they discovered their foes in camp. The French,\r\nsurprised and surrounded, sprang to arms, the Virginians fired, there\r\nwas a sharp exchange of shots, and all was over. Ten of the French\r\nwere killed and twenty-one were taken prisoners, only one of the party\r\nescaping to carry back the news.\r\n\r\nThis little skirmish made a prodigious noise in its day, and was much\r\nheralded in France. The French declared that Jumonville, the leader,\r\nwho fell at the first fire, was foully assassinated, and that he and\r\nhis party were ambassadors and sacred characters. Paris rang with this\r\nfresh instance of British perfidy, and a M. Thomas celebrated the\r\nluckless Jumonville in a solemn epic poem in four books. French\r\nhistorians, relying on the account of the Canadian who escaped,\r\nadopted the same tone, and at a later day mourned over this black\r\nspot on Washington's character. The French view was simple nonsense.\r\nJumonville and his party, as the papers found on Jumonville showed,\r\nwere out on a spying and scouting expedition. They were seeking to\r\nsurprise the English when the English surprised them, with the usual\r\nbackwoods result. The affair has a dramatic interest because it was\r\nthe first blood shed in a great struggle, and was the beginning of a\r\nseries of world-wide wars and social and political convulsions, which\r\nterminated more than half a century later on the plains of Waterloo.\r\nIt gave immortality to an obscure French officer by linking his name\r\nwith that of his opponent, and brought Washington for the moment\r\nbefore the eyes of the world, which little dreamed that this Virginian\r\ncolonel was destined to be one of the principal figures in the great\r\nrevolutionary drama to which the war then beginning was but the\r\nprologue.\r\n\r\nWashington, for his part, well satisfied with his exploit, retraced\r\nhis steps, and having sent his prisoners back to Virginia, proceeded\r\nto consider his situation. It was not a very cheerful prospect.\r\nContrecoeur, with the main body of the French and Indians, was moving\r\ndown from the Monongahela a thousand strong. This of course was to\r\nhave been anticipated, and it does not seem to have in the least\r\ndamped Washington's spirits. His blood was up, his fighting temper\r\nthoroughly roused, and he prepared to push on. Colonel Fry had died\r\nmeanwhile, leaving Washington in command; but his troops came forward,\r\nand also not long after a useless \"independent\" company from South\r\nCarolina. Thus reinforced Washington advanced painfully some thirteen\r\nmiles, and then receiving sure intelligence of the approach of the\r\nFrench in great force fell back with difficulty to the Great Meadows,\r\nwhere he was obliged by the exhausted condition of his men to stop. He\r\nat once resumed work on Fort Necessity, and made ready for a desperate\r\ndefense, for the French were on his heels, and on July 3 appeared at\r\nthe Meadows. Washington offered battle outside the fort, and this\r\nbeing declined withdrew to his trenches, and skirmishing went on all\r\nday. When night fell it was apparent that the end had come. The men\r\nwere starved and worn out. Their muskets in many cases were rendered\r\nuseless by the rain, and their ammunition was spent. The Indians had\r\ndeserted, and the foe outnumbered them four to one. When the French\r\ntherefore offered a parley, Washington was forced reluctantly to\r\naccept. The French had no stomach for the fight, apparently, and\r\nallowed the English to go with their arms, exacting nothing but a\r\npledge that for a year they would not come to the Ohio.\r\n\r\nSo ended Washington's first campaign. His friend the Half-King, the\r\ncelebrated Seneca chief, Thanacarishon, who prudently departed on the\r\narrival of the French, has left us a candid opinion of Washington and\r\nhis opponents. \"The colonel,\" he said, \"was a good-natured man, but\r\nhad no experience; he took upon him to command the Indians as his\r\nslaves, and would have them every day upon the scout and to attack\r\nthe enemy by themselves, but would by no means take advice from the\r\nIndians. He lay in one place from one full moon to the other, without\r\nmaking any fortifications, except that little thing on the meadow;\r\nwhereas, had he taken advice, and built such fortifications as I\r\nadvised him, he might easily have beat off the French. But the French\r\nin the engagement acted like cowards, and the English like fools.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Enquiry into the Causes and Alienations of the Delaware\r\nand Shawanee Indians_, etc. London, 1759. By Charles Thomson,\r\nafterwards Secretary of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThere is a deal of truth in this opinion. The whole expedition was\r\nrash in the extreme. When Washington left Will's Creek he was aware\r\nthat he was going to meet a force of a thousand men with only a\r\nhundred and fifty raw recruits at his back. In the same spirit he\r\npushed on; and after the Jumonville affair, although he knew that the\r\nwilderness about him was swarming with enemies, he still struggled\r\nforward. When forced to retreat he made a stand at the Meadows and\r\noffered battle in the open to his more numerous and more prudent\r\nfoes, for he was one of those men who by nature regard courage as a\r\nsubstitute for everything, and who have a contempt for hostile odds.\r\nHe was ready to meet any number of French and Indians with cheerful\r\nconfidence and with real pleasure. He wrote, in a letter which\r\nsoon became famous, that he loved to hear bullets whistle, a sage\r\nobservation which he set down in later years as a folly of youth. Yet\r\nthis boyish outburst, foolish as it was, has a meaning to us, for it\r\nwas essentially true. Washington had the fierce fighting temper of the\r\nNorthmen. He loved battle and danger, and he never ceased to love them\r\nand to give way to their excitement, although he did not again set\r\ndown such sentiments in boastful phrase that made the world laugh.\r\nMen of such temper, moreover, are naturally imperious and have a fine\r\ndisregard of consequences, with the result that their allies, Indian\r\nor otherwise, often become impatient and finally useless. The campaign\r\nwas perfectly wild from the outset, and if it had not been for\r\nthe utter indifference to danger displayed by Washington, and the\r\nconsequent timidity of the French, that particular body of Virginians\r\nwould have been permanently lost to the British Empire.\r\n\r\nBut we learn from all this many things. It appears that Washington was\r\nnot merely a brave man, but one who loved fighting for its own sake.\r\nThe whole expedition shows an arbitrary temper and the most reckless\r\ncourage, valuable qualities, but here unrestrained, and mixed\r\nwith very little prudence. Some important lessons were learned by\r\nWashington from the rough teachings of inexorable and unconquerable\r\nfacts. He received in this campaign the first taste of that severe\r\nexperience which by its training developed the self-control and\r\nmastery of temper for which he became so remarkable. He did not spring\r\ninto life a perfect and impossible man, as is so often represented. On\r\nthe contrary, he was educated by circumstances; but the metal came out\r\nof the furnace of experience finely tempered, because it was by nature\r\nof the best and with but little dross to be purged away. In addition\r\nto all this he acquired for the moment what would now be called a\r\nEuropean reputation. He was known in Paris as an assassin, and in\r\nEngland, thanks to the bullet letter, as a \"fanfaron\" and brave\r\nbraggart. With these results he wended his way home much depressed in\r\nspirits, but not in the least discouraged, and fonder of fighting than\r\never.\r\n\r\nVirginia, however, took a kinder view of the campaign than did her\r\ndefeated soldier. She appreciated the gallantry of the offer to fight\r\nin the open and the general conduct of the troops, and her House of\r\nBurgesses passed a vote of thanks to Washington and his officers, and\r\ngave money to his men. In August he rejoined his regiment, only to\r\nrenew the vain struggle against incompetence and extravagance, and as\r\nif this were not enough, his sense of honor was wounded and his temper\r\nmuch irritated by the governor's playing false to the prisoners taken\r\nin the Jumonville fight. While thus engaged, news came that the French\r\nwere off their guard at Fort Duquesne, and Dinwiddie was for having\r\nthe regiment of undisciplined troops march again into the wilderness.\r\nWashington, however, had learned something, if not a great deal, and\r\nhe demonstrated the folly of such an attempt in a manner too clear to\r\nbe confuted.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Burgesses came together, and more money being voted,\r\nDinwiddie hit on a notable plan for quieting dissensions between\r\nregulars and provincials by dividing all the troops into independent\r\ncompanies, with no officer higher than a captain. Washington, the\r\nonly officer who had seen fighting and led a regiment, resented quite\r\nproperly this senseless policy, and resigning his commission withdrew\r\nto Mount Vernon to manage the estate and attend to his own affairs. He\r\nwas driven to this course still more strongly by the original cause of\r\nDinwiddie's arrangement. The English government had issued an order\r\nthat officers holding the king's commission should rank provincial\r\nofficers, and that provincial generals and field officers should have\r\nno rank when a general or field officer holding a royal commission was\r\npresent. The degradation of being ranked by every whipper-snapper who\r\nmight hold a royal commission by virtue, perhaps, of being the bastard\r\nson of some nobleman's cast-off mistress was more than the temper\r\nof George Washington at least could bear, and when Governor Sharpe,\r\ngeneral by the king's commission, and eager to secure the services\r\nof the best fighter in Virginia, offered him a company and urged his\r\nacceptance, he replied in language that must have somewhat astonished\r\nhis excellency. \"You make mention in your letter,\" he wrote to Colonel\r\nFitzhugh, Governor Sharpe's second in command, \"of my continuing in\r\nthe service, and retaining my colonel's commission. This idea has\r\nfilled me with surprise; for, if you think me capable of holding a\r\ncommission that has neither rank nor emolument annexed to it, you must\r\nentertain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness, and believe\r\nme to be more empty than the commission itself.... In short, every\r\ncaptain bearing the king's commission, every half-pay officer, or\r\nothers, appearing with such a commission, would rank before me.... Yet\r\nmy inclinations are strongly bent to arms.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter disappointment to withdraw from military life, but\r\nWashington had an intense sense of personal dignity; not the small\r\nvanity of a petty mind, but the quality of a proud man conscious of\r\nhis own strength and purpose. It was of immense value to the American\r\npeople at a later day, and there is something very instructive in this\r\nearly revolt against the stupid arrogance which England has always\r\nthought it wise to display toward this country. She has paid dearly\r\nfor indulging it, but it has seldom cost her more than when it drove\r\nWashington from her service, and left in his mind a sense of indignity\r\nand injustice.\r\n\r\nMeantime this Virginian campaigning had started a great movement.\r\nEngland was aroused, and it was determined to assail France in Nova\r\nScotia, from New York and on the Ohio. In accordance with this plan\r\nGeneral Braddock arrived in Virginia February 20, 1755, with two\r\npicked regiments, and encamped at Alexandria. Thither Washington used\r\nto ride and look longingly at the pomp and glitter, and wish that he\r\nwore engaged in the service. Presently this desire became known, and\r\nBraddock, hearing of the young Virginian's past experience, offered\r\nhim a place on his staff with the rank of colonel where he would\r\nbe subject only to the orders of the general, and could serve as a\r\nvolunteer. He therefore accepted at once, and threw himself into\r\nhis new duties with hearty good-will. Every step now was full of\r\ninstruction. At Annapolis he met the governors of the other\r\ncolonies, and was interested and attracted by this association with\r\ndistinguished public men. In the army to which he was attached he\r\nstudied with the deepest attention the best discipline of Europe,\r\nobserving everything and forgetting nothing, thus preparing himself\r\nunconsciously to use against his teachers the knowledge he acquired.\r\n\r\nHe also made warm friends with the English officers, and was treated\r\nwith consideration by his commander. The universal practice of all\r\nEnglishmen at that time was to behave contemptuously to the colonists,\r\nbut there was something about Washington which made this impossible.\r\nThey all treated him with the utmost courtesy, vaguely conscious that\r\nbeneath the pleasant, quiet manner there was a strength of character\r\nand ability such as is rarely found, and that this was a man whom it\r\nwas unsafe to affront. There is no stronger instance of Washington's\r\npower of impressing himself upon others than that he commanded now\r\nthe respect and affection of his general, who was the last man to be\r\neasily or favorably affected by a young provincial officer.\r\n\r\nEdward Braddock was a veteran soldier, a skilled disciplinarian, and a\r\nrigid martinet. He was narrow-minded, brutal, and brave. He had led a\r\nfast life in society, indulging in coarse and violent dissipations,\r\nand was proud with the intense pride of a limited intelligence and a\r\nnature incapable of physical fear. It would be difficult to conceive\r\nof a man more unfit to be entrusted with the task of marching through\r\nthe wilderness and sweeping the French from the Ohio. All the\r\nconditions which confronted him were unfamiliar and beyond his\r\nexperience. He cordially despised the provincials who were essential\r\nto his success, and lost no opportunity of showing his contempt for\r\nthem. The colonists on their side, especially in Pennsylvania, gave\r\nhim, unfortunately, only too much ground for irritation and disgust.\r\nThey were delighted to see this brilliant force come from England to\r\nfight their battles, but they kept on wrangling and holding back,\r\nrefusing money and supplies, and doing nothing. Braddock chafed and\r\ndelayed, swore angrily, and lingered still. Washington strove to help\r\nhim, but defended his country fearlessly against wholesale and furious\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nFinally the army began to move, but so slowly and after so much delay\r\nthat they did not reach Will's Creek until the middle of May. Here\r\ncame another exasperating pause, relieved only by Franklin, who,\r\nby giving his own time, ability, and money, supplied the necessary\r\nwagons. Then they pushed on again, but with the utmost slowness. With\r\nsupreme difficulty they made an elaborate road over the mountains as\r\nthey marched, and did not reach the Little Meadows until June 16. Then\r\nat last Braddock turned to his young aide for the counsel which had\r\nalready been proffered and rejected many times. Washington advised the\r\ndivision of the army, so that the main body could hurry forward in\r\nlight marching order while a detachment remained behind and brought\r\nup the heavy baggage. This plan was adopted, and the army started\r\nforward, still too heavily burdened, as Washington thought, but in\r\nsomewhat better trim for the wilderness than before. Their progress,\r\nquickened as it was, still seemed slow to Washington, but he was taken\r\nill with a fever, and finally was compelled by Braddock to stop for\r\nrest at the ford of Youghiogany. He made Braddock promise that he\r\nshould be brought up before the army reached Fort Duquesne, and wrote\r\nto his friend Orme that he would not miss the impending battle for\r\nfive hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his fever abated a little he left Colonel Dunbar, and,\r\nbeing unable to sit on a horse, was conveyed to the front in a wagon,\r\ncoming up with the army on July 8. He was just in time, for the next\r\nday the troops forded the Monongahela and marched to attack the fort.\r\nThe splendid appearance of the soldiers as they crossed the river\r\nroused Washington's enthusiasm; but he was not without misgivings.\r\nFranklin had already warned Braddock against the danger of surprise,\r\nand had been told with a sneer that while these savages might be\r\na formidable enemy to raw American militia, they could make no\r\nimpression on disciplined troops. Now at the last moment Washington\r\nwarned the general again and was angrily rebuked.\r\n\r\nThe troops marched on in ordered ranks, glittering and beautiful.\r\nSuddenly firing was heard in the front, and presently the van was\r\nflung back on the main body. Yells and war-whoops resounded on every\r\nside, and an unseen enemy poured in a deadly fire. Washington begged\r\nBraddock to throw his men into the woods, but all in vain. Fight in\r\nplatoons they must, or not at all. The result was that they did not\r\nfight at all. They became panic-stricken, and huddled together,\r\novercome with fear, until at last when Braddock was mortally wounded\r\nthey broke in wild rout and fled. Of the regular troops, seven\r\nhundred, and of the officers, who showed the utmost bravery, sixty-two\r\nout of eighty-six, were killed or wounded. Two hundred Frenchmen and\r\nsix hundred Indians achieved this signal victory. The only thing\r\nthat could be called fighting on the English side was done by\r\nthe Virginians, \"the raw American militia,\" who, spread out as\r\nskirmishers, met their foes on their own ground, and were cut off\r\nafter a desperate resistance almost to a man.\r\n\r\nWashington at the outset flung himself headlong into the fight. He\r\nrode up and down the field, carrying orders and striving to rally \"the\r\ndastards,\" as he afterwards called the regular troops. He endeavored\r\nto bring up the artillery, but the men would not serve the guns,\r\nalthough to set an example he aimed and discharged one himself. All\r\nthrough that dreadful carnage he rode fiercely about, raging with the\r\nexcitement of battle, and utterly exposed from beginning to end. Even\r\nnow it makes the heart beat quicker to think of him amid the smoke and\r\nslaughter as he dashed hither and thither, his face glowing and his\r\neyes shining with the fierce light of battle, leading on his own\r\nVirginians, and trying to stay the tide of disaster. He had two horses\r\nshot under him and four bullets through his coat. The Indians thought\r\nhe bore a charmed life, while his death was reported in the colonies,\r\ntogether with his dying speech, which, he dryly wrote to his brother,\r\nhe had not yet composed.\r\n\r\nWhen the troops broke it was Washington who gathered the fugitives and\r\nbrought off the dying general. It was he who rode on to meet Dunbar,\r\nand rallying the fugitives enabled the wretched remnants to take up\r\ntheir march for the settlements. He it was who laid Braddock in the\r\ngrave four days after the defeat, and read over the dead the solemn\r\nwords of the English service. Wise, sensible, and active in the\r\nadvance, splendidly reckless on the day of battle, cool and collected\r\non the retreat, Washington alone emerged from that history of disaster\r\nwith added glory. Again he comes before us as, above all things,\r\nthe fighting man, hot-blooded and fierce in action, and utterly\r\nindifferent to the danger which excited and delighted him. But the\r\nearlier lesson had not been useless. He now showed a prudence and\r\nwisdom in counsel which were not apparent in the first of his\r\ncampaigns, and he no longer thought that mere courage was\r\nall-sufficient, or that any enemy could be despised. He was plainly\r\none of those who could learn. His first experience had borne good\r\nfruit, and now he had been taught a series of fresh and valuable\r\nlessons. Before his eyes had been displayed the most brilliant\r\nEuropean discipline, both in camp and on the march. He had studied\r\nand absorbed it all, talking with veterans and hearing from them many\r\nthings that he could have acquired nowhere else. Once more had he\r\nbeen taught, in a way not to be forgotten, that it is never well to\r\nunderrate one's opponent. He had looked deeper, too, and had seen what\r\nthe whole continent soon understood, that English troops were not\r\ninvincible, that they could be beaten by Indians, and that they were\r\nafter all much like other men. This was the knowledge, fatal in\r\nafter days to British supremacy, which Braddock's defeat brought to\r\nWashington and to the colonists, and which was never forgotten. Could\r\nhe have looked into the future, he would have seen also in this\r\nill-fated expedition an epitome of much future history. The expedition\r\nbegan with stupid contempt toward America and all things American, and\r\nended in ruin and defeat. It was a bitter experience, much heeded by\r\nthe colonists, but disregarded by England, whose indifference was paid\r\nfor at a heavy cost.\r\n\r\nAfter the hasty retreat, Colonel Dunbar, stricken with panic, fled\r\nonward to Philadelphia, abandoning everything, and Virginia was left\r\nnaturally in a state of great alarm. The assembly came together, and\r\nat last, thoroughly frightened, voted abundant money, and ordered a\r\nregiment of a thousand men to be raised. Washington, who had returned\r\nto Mount Vernon ill and worn-out, was urged to solicit the command,\r\nbut it was not his way to solicit, and he declined to do so now.\r\nAugust 14, he wrote to his mother: \"If it is in my power to avoid\r\ngoing to the Ohio again, I shall; but if the command is pressed upon\r\nme by the general voice of the country, and offered upon such terms as\r\ncannot be objected against, it would reflect dishonor on me to refuse\r\nit.\" The same day he was offered the command of all the Virginian\r\nforces on his own terms, and accepted. Virginia believed in\r\nWashington, and he was ready to obey her call.\r\n\r\nHe at once assumed command and betook himself to Winchester, a general\r\nwithout an army, but still able to check by his presence the existing\r\npanic, and ready to enter upon the trying, dreary, and fruitless work\r\nthat lay before him. In April, 1757, he wrote: \"I have been posted\r\nthen, for more than twenty months past, upon our cold and barren\r\nfrontiers, to perform, I think I may say, impossibilities; that is, to\r\nprotect from the cruel incursions of a crafty, savage enemy a line of\r\ninhabitants, of more than three hundred and fifty miles in extent,\r\nwith a force inadequate to the task.\" This terse statement covers\r\nall that can be said of the next three years. It was a long struggle\r\nagainst a savage foe in front, and narrowness, jealousy, and stupidity\r\nbehind; apparently without any chance of effecting anything, or\r\ngaining any glory or reward. Troops were voted, but were raised with\r\ndifficulty, and when raised were neglected and ill-treated by the\r\nwrangling governor and assembly, which caused much ill-suppressed\r\nwrath in the breast of the commander-in-chief, who labored day and\r\nnight to bring about better discipline in camp, and who wrote long\r\nletters to Williamsburg recounting existing evils and praying for a\r\nnew militia law.\r\n\r\nThe troops, in fact, were got out with vast difficulty even under the\r\nmost stinging necessity, and were almost worthless when they came.\r\nOf one \"noble captain\" who refused to come, Washington wrote: \"With\r\ncoolness and moderation this great captain answered that his wife,\r\nfamily, and corn were all at stake; so were those of his soldiers;\r\ntherefore it was impossible for him to come. Such is the example\r\nof the officers; such the behavior of the men; and upon such\r\ncircumstances depends the safety of our country!\" But while the\r\nsoldiers were neglected, and the assembly faltered, and the militia\r\ndisobeyed, the French and Indians kept at work on the long, exposed\r\nfrontier. There panic reigned, farmhouses and villages went up in\r\nsmoke, and the fields were reddened with slaughter at each fresh\r\nincursion. Gentlemen in Williamsburg bore these misfortunes with\r\nreasonable fortitude, but Washington raged against the abuses and the\r\ninaction, and vowed that nothing but the imminent danger prevented his\r\nresignation. \"The supplicating tears of the women,\" he wrote, \"and\r\nmoving petitions of the men melt me into such deadly sorrow that\r\nI solemnly declare, if I know my own mind, I could offer myself\r\na willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy, provided that would\r\ncontribute to the people's ease.\" This is one of the rare flashes\r\nof personal feeling which disclose the real man, warm of heart and\r\ntemper, full of human sympathy, and giving vent to hot indignation in\r\nwords which still ring clear and strong across the century that has\r\ncome and gone.\r\n\r\nSerious troubles, moreover, were complicated by petty annoyances. A\r\nMaryland captain, at the head of thirty men, undertook to claim rank\r\nover the Virginian commander-in-chief because he had held a king's\r\ncommission; and Washington was obliged to travel to Boston in order to\r\nhave the miserable thing set right by Governor Shirley. This affair\r\nsettled, he returned to take up again the old disheartening struggle,\r\nand his outspoken condemnation of Dinwiddie's foolish schemes and of\r\nthe shortcomings of the government began to raise up backbiters\r\nand malcontents at Williamsburg. \"My orders,\" he said, \"are dark,\r\ndoubtful, and uncertain; to-day approved, to-morrow condemned. Left\r\nto act and proceed at hazard, accountable for the consequences, and\r\nblamed without the benefit of defense.\" He determined nevertheless\r\nto bear with his trials until the arrival of Lord Loudon, the new\r\ncommander-in-chief, from whom he expected vigor and improvement.\r\nUnfortunately he was destined to have only fresh disappointment from\r\nthe new general, for Lord Loudon was merely one more incompetent man\r\nadded to the existing confusion. He paid no heed to the South, matters\r\ncontinued to go badly in the North, and Virginia was left helpless. So\r\nWashington toiled on with much discouragement, and the disagreeable\r\nattacks upon him increased. That it should have been so is not\r\nsurprising, for he wrote to the governor, who now held him in much\r\ndisfavor, to the speaker, and indeed to every one, with a most galling\r\nplainness. He was only twenty-five, be it remembered, and his high\r\ntemper was by no means under perfect control. He was anything but\r\ndiplomatic at that period of his life, and was far from patient, using\r\nlanguage with much sincerity and force, and indulging in a blunt irony\r\nof rather a ferocious kind. When he was accused finally of getting up\r\nreports of imaginary dangers, his temper gave way entirely. He wrote\r\nwrathfully to the governor for justice, and added in a letter to\r\nhis friend, Captain Peachey: \"As to Colonel C.'s gross and infamous\r\nreflections on my conduct last spring, it will be needless, I dare\r\nsay, to observe further at this time than that the liberty which he\r\nhas been pleased to allow himself in sporting with my character is\r\nlittle else than a comic entertainment, discovering at one view his\r\npassionate fondness for your friend, his inviolable love of truth,\r\nhis unfathomable knowledge, and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in\r\ndisplaying it. You are heartily welcome to make use of any letter or\r\nletters which I may at any time have written to you; for although\r\nI keep no copies of epistles to my friends, nor can remember the\r\ncontents of all of them, yet I am sensible that the narrations are\r\njust, and that truth and honesty will appear in my writings; of which,\r\ntherefore, I shall not be ashamed, though criticism may censure my\r\nstyle.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little more patience would have produced better results,\r\nbut it is pleasant to find one man, in that period of stupidity and\r\nincompetency, who was ready to free his mind in this refreshing way.\r\nThe only wonder is that he was not driven from his command. That they\r\ninsisted on keeping him there shows beyond everything that he\r\nhad already impressed himself so strongly on Virginia that the\r\nauthorities, although they smarted under his attacks, did not dare to\r\nmeddle with him. Dinwiddie and the rest could foil him in obtaining a\r\ncommission in the king's army, but they could not shake his hold upon\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1758 his health broke down completely. He was so\r\nill that he thought that his constitution was seriously injured;\r\nand therefore withdrew to Mount Vernon, where he slowly recovered.\r\nMeantime a great man came at last to the head of affairs in England,\r\nand inspired by William Pitt, fleets and armies went forth to conquer.\r\nReviving at the prospect, Washington offered his services to General\r\nForbes, who had come to undertake the task which Braddock had failed\r\nto accomplish. Once more English troops appeared, and a large army\r\nwas gathered. Then the old story began again, and Washington, whose\r\nproffered aid had been gladly received, chafed and worried all summer\r\nat the fresh spectacle of delay and stupidity which was presented\r\nto him. His advice was disregarded, and all the weary business of\r\nbuilding new roads through the wilderness was once more undertaken. A\r\ndetachment, sent forward contrary to his views, met with the fate of\r\nBraddock, and as the summer passed, and autumn changed to winter, it\r\nlooked as if nothing would be gained in return for so much toil and\r\npreparation. But Pitt had conquered the Ohio in Canada, news arrived\r\nof the withdrawal of the French, the army pressed on, and, with\r\nWashington in the van, marched into the smoking ruins of Fort\r\nDuquesne, henceforth to be known to the world as Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nSo closed the first period in Washington's public career. We have seen\r\nhim pass through it in all its phases. It shows him as an adventurous\r\npioneer, as a reckless frontier fighter, and as a soldier of great\r\npromise. He learned many things in this time, and was taught much in\r\nthe hard school of adversity. In the effort to conquer Frenchmen and\r\nIndians he studied the art of war, and at the same time he learned\r\nto bear with and to overcome the dullness and inefficiency of the\r\ngovernment he served. Thus he was forced to practise self-control in\r\norder to attain his ends, and to acquire skill in the management of\r\nmen. There could have been no better training for the work he was to\r\ndo in the after years, and the future showed how deeply he profited by\r\nit. Let us turn now, for a moment, to the softer and pleasanter side\r\nof life, and having seen what Washington was, and what he did as a\r\nfighting man, let us try to know him in the equally important and far\r\nmore attractive domain of private and domestic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLOVE AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Willis, of Fredericksburg, who was at school with Washington,\r\nused to speak of him as an unusually studious and industrious boy, but\r\nrecalled one occasion when he distinguished himself and surprised his\r\nschoolmates by \"romping with one of the largest girls.\"[1] Half a\r\ncentury later, when the days of romping were long over and gone, a\r\ngentleman writing of a Mrs. Hartley, whom Washington much admired,\r\nsaid that the general always liked a fine woman.[2] It is certain that\r\nfrom romping he passed rapidly to more serious forms of expressing\r\nregard, for by the time he was fourteen he had fallen deeply in love\r\nwith Mary Bland of Westmoreland, whom he calls his \"Lowland Beauty,\"\r\nand to whom he wrote various copies of verses, preserved amid the\r\nnotes of surveys, in his diary for 1747-48. The old tradition\r\nidentified the \"Lowland Beauty\" with Miss Lucy Grymes, perhaps\r\ncorrectly, and there are drafts of letters addressed to \"Dear Sally,\"\r\nwhich suggest that the mistake in identification might have arisen\r\nfrom the fact that there were several ladies who answered to that\r\ndescription. In the following sentence from the draft of a letter to a\r\nmasculine sympathizer, also preserved in the tell-tale diary of 1748,\r\nthere is certainly an indication that the constancy of the lover was\r\nnot perfect. \"Dear Friend Robin,\" he wrote: \"My place of residence at\r\npresent is at his Lordship's, where I might, were my heart disengaged,\r\npass my time very pleasantly, as there is a very agreeable young lady\r\nin the same house, Colonel George Fairfax's wife's sister. But that\r\nonly adds fuel to the fire, as being often and unavoidably in company\r\nwith her revives my former passion for your Lowland Beauty; whereas\r\nwere I to live more retired from young women, I might in some measure\r\nalleviate my sorrow by burying that chaste and troublesome passion in\r\noblivion; I am very well assured that this will be the only antidote\r\nor remedy.\" Our gloomy young gentleman, however, did not take to\r\nsolitude to cure the pangs of despised love, but preceded to calm his\r\nspirits by the society of this same sister-in-law of George Fairfax,\r\nMiss Mary Cary. One \"Lowland Beauty,\" Lucy Grymes, married Henry Lee,\r\nand became the mother of \"Legion Harry,\" a favorite officer and friend\r\nof Washington in the Revolution, and the grandmother of Robert E. Lee,\r\nthe great soldier of the Southern Confederacy. The affair with Miss\r\nCary went on apparently for some years, fitfully pursued in the\r\nintervals of war and Indian fighting, and interrupted also by matters\r\nof a more tender nature. The first diversion occurred about 1752, when\r\nwe find Washington writing to William Fauntleroy, at Richmond, that he\r\nproposed to come to his house to see his sister, Miss Betsy, and that\r\nhe hoped for a revocation of her former cruel sentence.[3] Miss Betsy,\r\nhowever, seems to have been obdurate, and we hear no more of love\r\naffairs until much later, and then in connection with matters of a\r\ngraver sort.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Quoted from the Willis MS. by Mr. Conway, in _Magazine of\r\nAmerican History_, March, 1887, p. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Magazine of American History_, i. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Historical Magazine_, 3d series, 1873. Letter\r\ncommunicated by Fitzhugh Lee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary Cary]\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Dagworthy, commanding thirty men in the Maryland\r\nservice, undertook in virtue of a king's commission to outrank the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Virginian forces, Washington made up his\r\nmind that he would have this question at least finally and properly\r\nsettled. So, as has been said, he went to Boston, saw Governor\r\nShirley, and had the dispute determined in his own favor. He made\r\nthe journey on horseback, and had with him two of his aides and two\r\nservants. An old letter, luckily preserved, tells us how he looked,\r\nfor it contains orders to his London agents for various articles, sent\r\nfor perhaps in anticipation of this very expedition. In Braddock's\r\ncampaign the young surveyor and frontier soldier had been thrown among\r\na party of dashing, handsomely equipped officers fresh from London,\r\nand their appearance had engaged his careful attention. Washington was\r\na thoroughly simple man in all ways, but he was also a man of\r\ntaste and a lover of military discipline. He had a keen sense of\r\nappropriateness, a valuable faculty which stood him in good stead in\r\ngrave as well as trivial matters all through his career, and which in\r\nhis youth came out most strongly in the matter of manners and personal\r\nappearance. He was a handsome man, and liked to be well dressed and to\r\nhave everything about himself or his servants of the best. Yet he\r\nwas not a mere imitator of fashions or devoted to fine clothes. The\r\nAmerican leggins and fringed hunting-shirt had a strong hold on his\r\naffections, and he introduced them into Forbes's army, and again into\r\nthe army of the Revolution, as the best uniform for the backwoods\r\nfighters. But he learned with Braddock that the dress of parade has as\r\nreal military value as that of service, and when he traveled northward\r\nto settle about Captain Dagworthy, he felt justly that he now was\r\ngoing on parade for the first time as the representative of his troops\r\nand his colony. Therefore with excellent sense he dressed as befitted\r\nthe occasion, and at the same time gratified his own taste.\r\n\r\nThanks to these precautions, the little cavalcade that left Virginia\r\non February 4, 1756, must have looked brilliant enough as they rode\r\naway through the dark woods. First came the colonel, mounted of course\r\non the finest of animals, for he loved and understood horses from the\r\ntime when he rode bareback in the pasture to those later days when he\r\nacted as judge at a horse-race and saw his own pet colt \"Magnolia\"\r\nbeaten. In this expedition he wore, of course, his uniform of buff\r\nand blue, with a white and scarlet cloak over his shoulders, and a\r\nsword-knot of red and gold. His \"horse furniture\" was of the best\r\nLondon make, trimmed with \"livery lace,\" and the Washington arms were\r\nengraved upon the housings. Close by his side rode his two aides,\r\nlikewise in buff and blue, and behind came his servants, dressed in\r\nthe Washington colors of white and scarlet and wearing hats laced with\r\nsilver. Thus accoutred, they all rode on together to the North.\r\n\r\nThe colonel's fame had gone before him, for the hero of Braddock's\r\nstricken field and the commander of the Virginian forces was known by\r\nreputation throughout the colonies. Every door flew open to him as he\r\npassed, and every one was delighted to welcome the young soldier. He\r\nwas dined and wined and fêted in Philadelphia, and again in New York,\r\nwhere he fell in love at apparently short notice with the heiress Mary\r\nPhilipse, the sister-in-law of his friend Beverly Robinson. Tearing\r\nhimself away from these attractions he pushed on to Boston, then\r\nthe most important city on the continent, and the head-quarters of\r\nShirley, the commander-in-chief. The little New England capital had at\r\nthat time a society which, rich for those days, was relieved from its\r\nPuritan sombreness by the gayety and life brought in by the royal\r\nofficers. Here Washington lingered ten days, talking war and politics\r\nwith the governor, visiting in state the \"great and general court,\"\r\ndancing every night at some ball, dining with and being fêted by the\r\nmagnates of the town. His business done, he returned to New York,\r\ntarried there awhile for the sake of the fair dame, but came to no\r\nconclusions, and then, like the soldier in the song, he gave his\r\nbridle-rein a shake and rode away again to the South, and to the\r\nharassed and ravaged frontier of Virginia.\r\n\r\nHow much this little interlude, pushed into a corner as it has been by\r\nthe dignity of history,--how much it tells of the real man! How the\r\nstatuesque myth and the priggish myth and the dull and solemn myth\r\nmelt away before it! Wise and strong, a bearer of heavy responsibility\r\nbeyond his years, daring in fight and sober in judgment, we have here\r\nthe other and the more human side of Washington. One loves to picture\r\nthat gallant, generous, youthful figure, brilliant in color and manly\r\nin form, riding gayly on from one little colonial town to another,\r\nfeasting, dancing, courting, and making merry. For him the myrtle and\r\nivy were entwined with the laurel, and fame was sweetened by youth. He\r\nwas righteously ready to draw from life all the good things which\r\nfate and fortune then smiling upon him could offer, and he took his\r\npleasure frankly, with an honest heart.\r\n\r\nWe know that he succeeded in his mission and put the captain of thirty\r\nmen in his proper place, but no one now can tell how deeply he was\r\naffected by the charms of Miss Philipse. The only certain fact is that\r\nhe was able not long after to console himself very effectually. Riding\r\naway from Mount Vernon once more, in the spring of 1758, this time to\r\nWilliamsburg with dispatches, he stopped at William's Ferry to dine\r\nwith his friend Major Chamberlayne, and there he met Martha Dandridge,\r\nthe widow of Daniel Parke Custis. She was young, pretty, intelligent,\r\nand an heiress, and her society seemed to attract the young soldier.\r\nThe afternoon wore away, the horses came to the door at the appointed\r\ntime, and after being walked back and forth for some hours were\r\nreturned to the stable. The sun went down, and still the colonel\r\nlingered. The next morning he rode away with his dispatches, but on\r\nhis return he paused at the White House, the home of Mrs. Custis, and\r\nthen and there plighted his troth with the charming widow. The wooing\r\nwas brief and decisive, and the successful lover departed for the\r\ncamp, to feel more keenly than ever the delays of the British officers\r\nand the shortcomings of the colonial government. As soon as Fort\r\nDuquesne had fallen he hurried home, resigned his commission in the\r\nlast week of December, and was married on January 6, 1759. It was a\r\nbrilliant wedding party which assembled on that winter day in the\r\nlittle church near the White House. There were gathered Francis\r\nFauquier, the gay, free-thinking, high-living governor, gorgeous in\r\nscarlet and gold; British officers, redcoated and gold-laced, and all\r\nthe neighboring gentry in the handsomest clothes that London credit\r\ncould furnish. The bride was attired in silk and satin, laces and\r\nbrocade, with pearls on her neck and in her ears; while the bridegroom\r\nappeared in blue and silver trimmed with scarlet, and with gold\r\nbuckles at his knees and on his shoes. After the ceremony the bride\r\nwas taken home in a coach and six, her husband riding beside her,\r\nmounted on a splendid horse and followed by all the gentlemen of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary Morris born Mary Philipse]\r\n\r\nThe sunshine and glitter of the wedding-day must have appeared to\r\nWashington deeply appropriate, for he certainly seemed to have all\r\nthat heart of man could desire. Just twenty-seven, in the first flush\r\nof young manhood, keen of sense and yet wise in experience, life\r\nmust have looked very fair and smiling. He had left the army with a\r\nwell-earned fame, and had come home to take the wife of his choice and\r\nenjoy the good-will and respect of all men. While away on his last\r\ncampaign he had been elected a member of the House of Burgesses, and\r\nwhen he took his seat on removing to Williamsburg, three months after\r\nhis marriage, Mr. Robinson, the speaker, thanked him publicly in\r\neloquent words for his services to the country. Washington rose to\r\nreply, but he was so utterly unable to talk about himself that he\r\nstood before the House stammering and blushing, until the speaker\r\nsaid, \"Sit down, Mr. Washington; your modesty equals your valor, and\r\nthat surpasses the power of any language I possess.\" It is an old\r\nstory, and as graceful as it is old, but it was all very grateful to\r\nWashington, especially as the words of the speaker bodied forth the\r\nfeelings of Virginia. Such an atmosphere, filled with deserved respect\r\nand praise, was pleasant to begin with, and then he had everything\r\nelse too.\r\n\r\nHe not only continued to sit in the House year after year and help to\r\nrule Virginia, but he served on the church vestry, and so held in his\r\nhands the reins of local government. He had married a charming\r\nwoman, simple, straightforward, and sympathetic, free from gossip or\r\npretense, and as capable in practical matters as he was himself. By\r\nright of birth a member of the Virginian aristocracy, he had widened\r\nand strengthened his connections through his wife. A man of handsome\r\nproperty by the death of Lawrence Washington's daughter, he had become\r\nby his marriage one of the richest men of the country. Acknowledged\r\nto be the first soldier on the continent, respected and trusted in\r\npublic, successful and happy in private life, he had attained before\r\nhe was thirty to all that Virginia could give of wealth, prosperity,\r\nand honor, a fact of which he was well aware, for there never breathed\r\na man more wisely contented than George Washington at this period.\r\n\r\nHe made his home at Mount Vernon, adding many acres to the estate, and\r\ngiving to it his best attention. It is needless to say that he was\r\nsuccessful, for that was the ease with everything he undertook. He\r\nloved country life, and he was the best and most prosperous planter in\r\nVirginia, which was really a more difficult achievement than the mere\r\nstatement implies. Genuinely profitable farming in Virginia was not\r\ncommon, for the general system was a bad one. A single great staple,\r\neasily produced by the reckless exhaustion of land, and varying widely\r\nin the annual value of crops, bred improvidence and speculation.\r\nEverything was bought upon long credits, given by the London\r\nmerchants, and this, too, contributed largely to carelessness and\r\nwaste. The chronic state of a planter in a business way was one of\r\ndebt, and the lack of capital made his conduct of affairs extravagant\r\nand loose. With all his care and method Washington himself was often\r\npinched for ready money, and it was only by his thoroughness and\r\nforesight that he prospered and made money while so many of his\r\nneighbors struggled with debt and lived on in easy luxury, not knowing\r\nwhat the morrow might bring forth.\r\n\r\nA far more serious trouble than bad business methods was one which was\r\nlittle heeded at the moment, but which really lay at the foundation of\r\nthe whole system of society and business. This was the character of\r\nthe labor by which the plantations were worked. Slave labor is well\r\nknown now to be the most expensive and the worst form of labor that\r\ncan be employed. In the middle of the eighteenth century, however, its\r\nevils were not appreciated, either from an economical or a moral point\r\nof view. This is not the place to discuss the subject of African\r\nslavery in America. But it is important to know Washington's opinions\r\nin regard to an institution which was destined to have such a powerful\r\ninfluence upon the country, and it seems most appropriate to consider\r\nthose opinions at the moment when slaves became a practical factor in\r\nhis life as a Virginian planter.\r\n\r\nWashington accepted the system as he found it, as most men accept the\r\nsocial arrangements to which they are born. He grew up in a world\r\nwhere slavery had always existed, and where its rightfulness had never\r\nbeen questioned. Being on the frontier, occupied with surveying and\r\nwith war, he never had occasion to really consider the matter at all\r\nuntil he found himself at the head of large estates, with his own\r\nprosperity dependent on the labor of slaves. The first practical\r\nquestion, therefore, was how to employ this labor to the best\r\nadvantage. A man of his clear perceptions soon discovered the defects\r\nof the system, and he gave great attention to feeding and clothing\r\nhis slaves, and to their general management. Parkinson[1] says in a\r\ngeneral way that Washington treated his slaves harshly, spoke to them\r\nsharply, and maintained a military discipline, to which he attributed\r\nthe General's rare success as a planter. There can be no doubt of\r\nthe success, and the military discipline is probably true, but the\r\nstatement as to harshness is unsupported by any other authority.\r\nIndeed, Parkinson even contradicts it himself, for he says elsewhere\r\nthat Washington never bought or sold a slave, a proof of the highest\r\nand most intelligent humanity; and he adds in his final sketch of the\r\nGeneral's character, that he \"was incapable of wrong-doing, but did to\r\nall men as he would they should do to him. Therefore it is not to be\r\nsupposed that he would injure the negro.\" This agrees with what we\r\nlearn from all other sources. Humane by nature, he conceived a great\r\ninterest and pity for these helpless beings, and treated them with\r\nkindness and forethought. In a word, he was a wise and good master,\r\nas well as a successful one, and the condition of his slaves was\r\nas happy, and their labor as profitable, as was possible to such a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Tour in America_, 1798-1800.]\r\n\r\nSo the years rolled by; the war came and then the making of the\r\ngovernment, and Washington's thoughts were turned more and more, as\r\nwas the case with all the men of his time in that era of change and\r\nof new ideas, to the consideration of human slavery in its moral,\r\npolitical, and social aspects. To trace the course of his opinions\r\nin detail is needless. It is sufficient to summarize them, for the\r\nresults of his reflection and observation are more important than the\r\nprocesses by which they were reached. Washington became convinced that\r\nthe whole system was thoroughly bad, as well as utterly repugnant to\r\nthe ideas upon which the Revolution was fought and the government of\r\nthe United States founded. With a prescience wonderful for those days\r\nand on that subject, he saw that slavery meant the up-growth in the\r\nUnited States of two systems so radically hostile, both socially and\r\neconomically, that they could lead only to a struggle for political\r\nsupremacy, which in its course he feared would imperil the Union. For\r\nthis reason he deprecated the introduction of the slavery question\r\ninto the debates of the first Congress, because he realized its\r\ncharacter, and he did not believe that the Union or the government\r\nat that early day could bear the strain which in this way would be\r\nproduced. At the same time he felt that a right solution must be found\r\nor inconceivable evils would ensue. The inherent and everlasting wrong\r\nof the system made its continuance, to his mind, impossible. While\r\nit existed, he believed that the laws which surrounded it should be\r\nmaintained, because he thought that to violate these only added one\r\nwrong to another. He also doubted, as will be seen in a later chapter,\r\nwhere his conversation with John Bernard is quoted, whether the\r\nnegroes could be immediately emancipated with safety either to\r\nthemselves or to the whites, in their actual condition of ignorance,\r\nilliteracy, and helplessness. The plan which he favored, and which,\r\nit would seem, was his hope and reliance, was first the checking\r\nof importation, followed by a gradual emancipation, with proper\r\ncompensation to the owners and suitable preparation and education for\r\nthe slaves. He told the clergymen Asbury and Coke, when they visited\r\nhim for that purpose, that he was in favor of emancipation, and was\r\nready to write a letter to the assembly to that effect.[1] He wished\r\nfervently that such a spirit might take possession of the people of\r\nthe country, but he wrote to Lafayette that he despaired of seeing it.\r\nWhen he died he did all that lay within his power to impress his views\r\nupon his countrymen by directing that all his slaves should be set\r\nfree on the death of his wife. His precepts and his example in this\r\ngrave matter went unheeded for many years by the generations which\r\ncame after him. But now that slavery is dead, to the joy of all men,\r\nit is well to remember that on this terrible question Washington's\r\nopinions were those of a humane man, impatient of wrong, and of a\r\nnoble and far-seeing statesman, watchful of the evils that threatened\r\nhis country.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Magazine of American History_, 1880, p. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For some expressions of Washington's opinions on slavery,\r\nsee Sparks, viii. 414, ix. 159-163, and x. 224.]\r\n\r\nAfter this digression let us return to the Virginian farmer, whose\r\nmind was not disturbed as yet by thoughts of the destiny of the United\r\nStates, or considerations of the rights of man, but who was much\r\nexercised by the task of making an honest income out of his estates.\r\nTo do this he grappled with details as firmly as he did with the\r\ngeneral system under which all plantations in that day were carried\r\non. He understood every branch of farming; he was on the alert for\r\nevery improvement; he rose early, worked steadily, gave to everything\r\nhis personal supervision, kept his own accounts with wonderful\r\nexactness, and naturally enough his brands of flour went unquestioned\r\neverywhere, his credit was high, and he made money--so far as it\r\nwas possible under existing conditions. Like Shakespeare, as Bishop\r\nBlougram has it, he\r\n\r\n  \"Saved money, spent it, owned the worth of things.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no fine and senseless disregard for money or the good things of\r\nthis world, but on the contrary saw in them not the value attached to\r\nthem by vulgar minds, but their true worth. He was a solid, square,\r\nevenly-balanced man in those days, believing that whatever he did was\r\nworth doing well. So he farmed, as he fought and governed, better than\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\nWhile thus looking after his own estates at home, he went further\r\nafield in search of investments, keeping a shrewd eye on the western\r\nlands, and buying wisely and judiciously whenever he had the\r\nopportunity. He also constituted himself now, as in a later time, the\r\nchampion of the soldiers, for whom he had the truest sympathy and\r\naffection, and a large part of the correspondence of this period is\r\ndevoted to their claims for the lands granted them by the assembly.\r\nHe distinguished carefully among them, however, those who were\r\nundeserving, and to the major of the regiment, who had been excluded\r\nfrom the public thanks on account of cowardice at the Great Meadows,\r\nhe wrote as follows: \"Your impertinent letter was delivered to me\r\nyesterday. As I am not accustomed to receive such from any man, nor\r\nwould have taken the same language from you personally without letting\r\nyou feel some marks of my resentment, I would advise you to be\r\ncautious in writing me a second of the same tenor. But for your\r\nstupidity and sottishness you might have known, by attending to the\r\npublic gazette, that you had your full quantity of ten thousand acres\r\nof land allowed you. But suppose you had really fallen short, do you\r\nthink your superlative merit entitles you to greater indulgence than\r\nothers?... All my concern is that I ever engaged in behalf of so\r\nungrateful a fellow as you are.\" The writer of this letter, be it said\r\nin passing, was the man whom Mr. Weems and others tell us was knocked\r\ndown before his soldiers, and then apologized to his assailant. It may\r\nbe suspected that it was well for the recipient of this letter that\r\nhe did not have a personal interview with its author, and it may\r\nbe doubted if he ever sought one subsequently. Just, generous, and\r\nmagnanimous to an extraordinary degree, Washington had a dangerous\r\ntemper, held well under control, but blazing out now and again against\r\ninjustice, insolence, or oppression. He was a peaceful man, leading a\r\npeaceful life, but the fighting spirit only slumbered, and it\r\nwould break out at wrong of any sort, in a way which was extremely\r\nunpleasant and threatening to those who aroused it.\r\n\r\nApart from lands and money and the management of affairs, public and\r\nprivate, there were many other interests of varied nature which all\r\nhad their share of Washington's time and thought. He was a devoted\r\nhusband, and gave to his stepchildren the most affectionate care. He\r\nwatched over and protected them, and when the daughter died, after a\r\nlong and wasting illness, in 1773, he mourned for her as if she\r\nhad been his own, with all the tenderness of a deep and reserved\r\naffection. The boy, John Custis, he made his friend and companion from\r\nthe beginning, and his letters to the lad and about him are wise and\r\njudicious in the highest degree. He spent much time and thought on the\r\nquestion of education, and after securing the best instructors took\r\nthe boy to New York and entered him at Columbia College in 1773. Young\r\nCustis, however, did not remain there long, for he had fallen in love,\r\nand the following year was married to Eleanor Calvert, not without\r\nsome misgivings on the part of Washington, who had observed his ward's\r\nsomewhat flighty disposition, and who gave a great deal of anxious\r\nthought to his future. At home as abroad he was an undemonstrative\r\nman, but he had abundance of that real affection which labors for\r\nthose to whom it goes out more unselfishly and far more effectually\r\nthan that which bubbles and boils upon the surface like a shallow,\r\nnoisy brook.\r\n\r\nFrom the suggestions that he made in regard to young Custis, it is\r\nevident that Washington valued and respected education, and that he\r\nhad that regard for learning for its own sake which always exists\r\nin large measure in every thoughtful man. He read well, even if his\r\nactive life prevented his reading much, as we can see by his vigorous\r\nEnglish, and by his occasional allusions to history. From his London\r\norders we see, too, that everything about his house must have denoted\r\nthat its possessor had refinement and taste. His intense sense\r\nof propriety and unfailing instinct for what was appropriate are\r\neverywhere apparent. His dress, his furniture, his harnesses, the\r\nthings for the children, all show the same fondness for simplicity,\r\nand yet a constant insistence that everything should be the best of\r\nits kind. We can learn a good deal about any man by the ornaments of\r\nhis house, and by the portraits which hang on his walls; for these\r\ndumb things tell us whom among the great men of earth the owner\r\nadmires, and indicate the tastes he best loves to gratify. When\r\nWashington first settled with his wife at Mount Vernon, he ordered\r\nfrom Europe the busts of Alexander the Great, Charles XII. of Sweden,\r\nJulius Cæsar, Frederick of Prussia, Marlborough, and Prince Eugene,\r\nand in addition he asked for statuettes of \"two wild beasts.\" The\r\ncombination of soldier and statesman is the predominant admiration,\r\nthen comes the reckless and splendid military adventurer, and lastly\r\nwild life and the chase. There is no mistaking the ideas and fancies\r\nof the man who penned this order which has drifted down to us from the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nBut as Washington's active life was largely out of doors, so too were\r\nhis pleasures. He loved the fresh open-air existence of the woods\r\nand fields, and there he found his one great amusement. He shot and\r\nfished, but did not care much for these pursuits, for his hobby was\r\nhunting, which gratified at once his passion for horses and dogs and\r\nhis love for the strong excitement of the chase, when dashed with just\r\nenough danger to make it really fascinating. He showed in his sport\r\nthe same thoroughness and love of perfection that he displayed in\r\neverything else. His stables were filled with the best horses that\r\nVirginia could furnish. There were the \"blooded coach-horses\" for Mrs.\r\nWashington's carriage, \"Magnolia,\" a full-blooded Arabian, used by\r\nhis owner for the road, the ponies for the children, and finally, the\r\nhigh-bred hunters Chinkling and Valiant, Ajax and Blueskin, and the\r\nrest, all duly set down in the register in the handwriting of the\r\nmaster himself. His first visit in the morning was to the stables;\r\nthe next to the kennels to inspect and criticise the hounds, also\r\nmethodically registered and described, so that we can read the names\r\nof Vulcan and Ringwood, Singer and Truelove, Music and Sweetlips, to\r\nwhich the Virginian woods once echoed nearly a century and a half ago.\r\nHis hounds were the subject of much thought, and were so constantly\r\nand critically drafted as to speed, keenness, and bottom, that when in\r\nfull cry they ran so closely bunched that tradition says, in classic\r\nphrase, they could have been covered with a blanket. The hounds met\r\nthree times a week in the season, usually at Mount Vernon, sometimes\r\nat Belvoir. They would get off at daybreak, Washington in the midst of\r\nhis hounds, splendidly mounted, generally on his favorite Blueskin, a\r\npowerful iron-gray horse of great speed and endurance. He wore a blue\r\ncoat, scarlet waistcoat, buckskin breeches, and a velvet cap. Closely\r\nfollowed by his huntsman and the neighboring gentlemen, with the\r\nladies, headed, very likely, by Mrs. Washington in a scarlet habit,\r\nhe would ride to the appointed covert and throw in. There was no\r\ndifficulty in finding, and then away they would go, usually after a\r\ngray fox, sometimes after a big black fox, rarely to be caught. Most\r\nof the country was wild and unfenced, rough in footing, and offering\r\nhard and dangerous going for the horses, but Washington always made it\r\na rule to stay with his hounds. Cautious or timid riders, if they were\r\nso minded, could gallop along the wood roads with the ladies, and\r\ncontent themselves with glimpses of the hunt, but the master rode at\r\nthe front. The fields, it is to be feared, were sometimes small, but\r\nWashington hunted even if he had only his stepson or was quite alone.\r\n\r\nHis diaries abound with allusions to the sport. \"Went a-hunting with\r\nJacky Custis, and catched a fox after three hours chase; found it in\r\nthe creek.\" \"Mr. Bryan Fairfax, Mr. Grayson, and Phil. Alexander came\r\nhome by sunrise. Hunted and catched a fox with these. Lord Fairfax,\r\nhis brother, and Colonel Fairfax, all of whom, with Mr. Fairfax and\r\nMr. Wilson of England, dined here.\" Again, November 26 and 29, \"Hunted\r\nagain with the same party.\" \"1768, Jan. 8th. Hunting again with same\r\ncompany. Started a fox and run him 4 hours. Took the hounds off at\r\nnight.\" \"Jan. 15. Shooting.\" \"16. At home all day with cards; it\r\nsnowing.\" \"23. Rid to Muddy Hole and directed paths to be cut for\r\nfoxhunting.\" \"Feb. 12. Catched 2 foxes.\" \"Feb. 13. Catched 2 more\r\nfoxes.\" \"Mar. 2. Catched fox with bob'd tail and cut ears after\r\n7 hours chase, in which most of the dogs were worsted.\" \"Dec. 5.\r\nFox-hunting with Lord Fairfax and his brother and Colonel Fairfax.\r\nStarted a fox and lost it. Dined at Belvoir and returned in the\r\nevening.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MS. Diaries in State Department.]\r\n\r\nSo the entries run on, for he hunted almost every day in the season,\r\nusually with success, but always with persistence. Like all true\r\nsportsmen Washington had a horror of illicit sport of any kind, and\r\nalthough he shot comparatively little, he was much annoyed by a\r\nvagabond who lurked in the creeks and inlets on his estate, and\r\nslaughtered his canvas-back ducks. Hearing the report of a gun one\r\nmorning, he rode through the bushes and saw his poaching friend just\r\nshoving off in a canoe. The rascal raised his gun and covered his\r\npursuer, whereupon Washington, the cold-blooded and patient person\r\nso familiar in the myths, dashed his horse headlong into the water,\r\nseized the gun, grasped the canoe, and dragging it ashore pulled the\r\nman out of the boat and beat him soundly. If the man had yielded at\r\nonce he would probably have got off easily enough, but when he put\r\nWashington's life in imminent peril, the wild fighting spirit flared\r\nup as usual.\r\n\r\nThe hunting season was of course that of the most lavish hospitality.\r\nThere was always a great deal of dining about, but Mount Vernon was\r\nthe chief resort, and its doors, ever open, were flung far back when\r\npeople came for a meet, or gathered to talk over the events of a good\r\nrun. Company was the rule and solitude the exception. When only the\r\nfamily were at dinner, the fact was written down in the diary with\r\ngreat care as an unusual event, for Washington was the soul of\r\nhospitality, and although he kept early hours, he loved society and a\r\nhouseful of people. Profoundly reserved and silent as to himself,\r\na lover of solitude so far as his own thoughts and feelings were\r\nconcerned, he was far from being a solitary man in the ordinary\r\nacceptation of the word. He liked life and gayety and conversation, he\r\nliked music and dancing or a game of cards when the weather was bad,\r\nand he enjoyed heartily the presence of young people and of his own\r\nfriends. So Mount Vernon was always full of guests, and the master\r\nnoted in his diary that although he owned more than a hundred cows he\r\nwas obliged, nevertheless, to buy butter, which suggests an experience\r\nnot unknown to gentlemen farmers of any period, and also that company\r\nwas never lacking in that generous, open house overlooking the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nBeyond the bounds of his own estate he had also many occupations and\r\npleasures. He was a member of the House of Burgesses, diligent in his\r\nattention to the work of governing the colony. He was diligent also in\r\nchurch affairs, and very active in the vestry, which was the seat of\r\nlocal government in Virginia. We hear of him also as the manager\r\nof lotteries, which were a common form of raising money for local\r\npurposes, in preference to direct taxation. In a word, he was\r\nthoroughly public-spirited, and performed all the small duties which\r\nhis position demanded in the same spirit that he afterwards brought\r\nto the command of armies and to the government of the nation. He had\r\npleasure too, as well as business, away from Mount Vernon. He liked\r\nto go to his neighbors' houses and enjoy their hospitality as they\r\nenjoyed his. We hear of him at the courthouse on court days, where all\r\nthe country-side gathered to talk and listen to the lawyers and hear\r\nthe news, and when he went to Williamsburg his diary tells us of a\r\nround of dinners, beginning with the governor, of visits to the club,\r\nand of a regular attendance at the theatre whenever actors came to the\r\nlittle capital. Whether at home or abroad, he took part in all the\r\nserious pursuits, in all the interests, and in every reasonable\r\npleasure offered by the colony.\r\n\r\nTake it for all in all, it was a manly, wholesome, many-sided life. It\r\nkept Washington young and strong, both mentally and physically. When\r\nhe was forty he flung the iron bar, at some village sports, to a point\r\nwhich no competitor could approach. There was no man in all Virginia\r\nwho could ride a horse with such a powerful and assured seat.\r\nThere was no one who could journey farther on foot, and no man at\r\nWilliamsburg who showed at the governor's receptions such a commanding\r\npresence, or who walked with such a strong and elastic step. As with\r\nthe body so with the mind. He never rusted. A practical carpenter and\r\nsmith, he brought the same quiet intelligence and firm will to the\r\nforging of iron or the felling and sawing of trees that he had\r\ndisplayed in fighting France. The life of a country gentleman did not\r\ndull or stupefy him, or lead him to gross indulgences. He remained\r\nwell-made and athletic, strong and enduring, keen in perception and in\r\nsense, and warm in his feelings and affections. Many men would have\r\nbecome heavy and useless in these years of quiet country life, but\r\nWashington simply ripened, and, like all slowly maturing men, grew\r\nstronger, abler, and wiser in the happy years of rest and waiting\r\nwhich intervened between youth and middle age.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while the current of daily life flowed on thus gently at\r\nMount Vernon, the great stream of public events poured by outside. It\r\nran very calmly at first, after the war, and then with a quickening\r\nmurmur, which increased to an ominous roar when the passage of the\r\nStamp Act became known in America. Washington was always a constant\r\nattendant at the assembly, in which by sheer force of character, and\r\ndespite his lack of the talking and debating faculty, he carried more\r\nweight than any other member. He was present on May 29, 1765, when\r\nPatrick Henry introduced his famous resolutions and menaced the king's\r\ngovernment in words which rang through the continent. The resolutions\r\nwere adopted, and Washington went home, with many anxious thoughts,\r\nto discuss the political outlook with his friend and neighbor George\r\nMason, one of the keenest and ablest men in Virginia. The utter\r\nfolly of the policy embodied in the Stamp Act struck Washington very\r\nforcibly. With that foresight for which he was so remarkable, he\r\nperceived what scarcely any one else even dreamt of, that persistence\r\nin this course must surely lead to a violent separation from the\r\nmother-country, and it is interesting to note in this, the first\r\ninstance when he was called upon to consider a political question of\r\ngreat magnitude, his clearness of vision and grasp of mind. In what he\r\nwrote there is no trace of the ambitious schemer, no threatening nor\r\nblustering, no undue despondency nor excited hopes. But there is a\r\ncalm understanding of all the conditions, an entire freedom from\r\nself-deception, and the power of seeing facts exactly as they were,\r\nwhich were all characteristic of his intellectual strength, and to\r\nwhich we shall need to recur again and again.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was received by Washington with sober but\r\nsincere pleasure. He had anticipated \"direful\" results and \"unhappy\r\nconsequences\" from its enforcement, and he freely said that those who\r\nwere instrumental in its repeal had his cordial thanks. He was no\r\nagitator, and had not come forward in this affair, so he now retired\r\nagain to Mount Vernon, to his farming and hunting, where he remained,\r\nwatching very closely the progress of events. He had marked the\r\ndangerous reservation of the principle in the very act of repeal; he\r\nobserved at Boston the gathering strength of what the wise ministers\r\nof George III. called sedition; he noted the arrival of British troops\r\nin the rebellious Puritan town; and he saw plainly enough, looming in\r\nthe background, the final appeal to arms. He wrote to Mason (April 5,\r\n1769), that \"at a time when our lordly masters in Great Britain will\r\nbe satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of American\r\nfreedom, something should be done to avert the stroke and maintain the\r\nliberty which we have derived from our ancestors. But the manner of\r\ndoing it, to answer the purpose effectually, is the point in question.\r\nThat no man should scruple or hesitate a moment to use arms in defense\r\nof so valuable a blessing is clearly my opinion. Yet arms, I would beg\r\nleave to add, should be the last resource, the _dernier ressort_.\" He\r\nthen urged the adoption of the only middle course, non-importation,\r\nbut he had not much hope in this expedient, although an honest desire\r\nis evident that it may prove effectual.\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly met in May, they received the new governor, Lord\r\nBotetourt, with much cordiality, and then fell to passing spirited\r\nand sharp-spoken resolutions declaring their own rights and defending\r\nMassachusetts. The result was a dissolution. Thereupon the burgesses\r\nrepaired to the Raleigh tavern, where they adopted a set of\r\nnon-importation resolutions and formed an association. The resolutions\r\nwere offered by Washington, and were the result of his quiet country\r\ntalks with Mason. When the moment for action arrived, Washington came\r\nnaturally to the front, and then returned quietly to Mount Vernon,\r\nonce more to go about his business and watch the threatening political\r\nhorizon. Virginia did not live up to this first non-importation\r\nagreement, and formed another a year later. But Washington was not in\r\nthe habit of presenting resolutions merely for effect, and there\r\nwas nothing of the actor in his composition. His resolutions meant\r\nbusiness, and he lived up to them rigidly himself. Neither tea nor\r\nany of the proscribed articles were allowed in his house. Most of\r\nthe leaders did not realize the seriousness of the situation, but\r\nWashington, looking forward with clear and sober gaze, was in grim\r\nearnest, and was fully conscious that when he offered his resolutions\r\nthe colony was trying the last peaceful remedy, and that the next step\r\nwould be war.\r\n\r\nStill he went calmly about his many affairs as usual, and gratified\r\nthe old passion for the frontier by a journey to Pittsburgh for the\r\nsake of lands and soldiers' claims, and thence down the Ohio and into\r\nthe wilderness with his old friends the trappers and pioneers. He\r\nvisited the Indian villages as in the days of the French mission, and\r\nnoted in the savages an ominous restlessness, which seemed, like the\r\nflight of birds, to express the dumb instinct of an approaching storm.\r\nThe clouds broke away somewhat under the kindly management of Lord\r\nBotetourt, and then gathered again more thickly on the accession of\r\nhis successor, Lord Dunmore. With both these gentlemen Washington was\r\non the most friendly terms. He visited them often, and was consulted\r\nby them, as it behooved them to consult the strongest man within the\r\nlimits of their government. Still he waited and watched, and scanned\r\ncarefully the news from the North. Before long he heard that\r\ntea-chests were floating in Boston harbor, and then from across the\r\nwater came intelligence of the passage of the Port Bill and other\r\nmeasures destined to crush to earth the little rebel town.\r\n\r\nWhen the Virginia assembly met again, they proceeded to congratulate\r\nthe governor on the arrival of Lady Dunmore, and then suddenly, as\r\nall was flowing smoothly along, there came a letter through the\r\ncorresponding committee which Washington had helped to establish,\r\ntelling of the measures against Boston. Everything else was thrown\r\naside at once, a vigorous protest was entered on the journal of the\r\nHouse, and June 1, when the Port Bill was to go into operation, was\r\nappointed a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer. The first result\r\nwas prompt dissolution of the assembly. The next was another meeting\r\nin the long room of the Raleigh tavern, where the Boston bill\r\nwas denounced, non-importation renewed, and the committee of\r\ncorrespondence instructed to take steps for calling a general\r\ncongress. Events were beginning to move at last with perilous\r\nrapidity. Washington dined with Lord Dunmore on the evening of that\r\nday, rode with him, and appeared at her ladyship's ball the next\r\nnight, for it was not his way to bite his thumb at men from whom he\r\ndiffered politically, nor to call the motives of his opponents in\r\nquestion. But when the 1st of June arrived, he noted in his diary that\r\nhe fasted all day and attended the appointed services. He always meant\r\nwhat he said, being of a simple nature, and when he fasted and prayed\r\nthere was something ominously earnest about it, something that his\r\nexcellency the governor, who liked the society of this agreeable\r\nman and wise counselor, would have done well to consider and draw\r\nconclusions from, and which he probably did not heed at all. He might\r\nwell have reflected, as he undoubtedly failed to do, that when men\r\nof the George Washington type fast and pray on account of political\r\nmisdoings, it is well for their opponents to look to it carefully.\r\n\r\nMeantime Boston had sent forth appeals to form a league among the\r\ncolonies, and thereupon another meeting was held in the Raleigh\r\ntavern, and a letter was dispatched advising the burgesses to consider\r\nthis matter of a general league and take the sense of their respective\r\ncounties. Virginia and Massachusetts had joined hands now, and they\r\nwere sweeping the rest of the continent irresistibly forward with\r\nthem. As for Washington, he returned to Mount Vernon and at once set\r\nabout taking the sense of his county, as he had agreed. Before doing\r\nso he had some correspondence with his old friend Bryan Fairfax. The\r\nFairfaxes naturally sided with the mother-country, and Bryan was much\r\ndistressed by the course of Virginia, and remonstrated strongly, and\r\nat length by letter, against violent measures. Washington replied\r\nto him: \"Does it not appear as clear as the sun in its meridian\r\nbrightness that there is a regular, systematic plan formed to fix the\r\nright and practice of taxation on us? Does not the uniform conduct of\r\nParliament for some years past confirm this? Do not all the debates,\r\nespecially those just brought to us in the House of Commons, on the\r\nside of government expressly declare that America must be taxed in\r\naid of the British funds, and that she has no longer resources within\r\nherself? Is there anything to be expected from petitioning after this?\r\nIs not the attack upon the liberty and property of the people of\r\nBoston, before restitution of the loss to the India Company was\r\ndemanded, a plain and self-evident proof of what they are aiming at?\r\nDo not the subsequent bills (now I dare say acts) for depriving the\r\nMassachusetts Bay of its charter, and for transporting offenders into\r\nother colonies, or to Great Britain for trial, where it is impossible\r\nfrom the nature of the thing that justice can be obtained, convince us\r\nthat the administration is determined to stick at nothing to carry\r\nits point? Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the\r\nseverest test?\" He was prepared, he continued, for anything except\r\nconfiscating British debts, which struck him as dishonorable. These\r\nwere plain but pregnant questions, but what we mark in them, and\r\nin all his letters of this time, is the absence of constitutional\r\ndiscussion, of which America was then full. They are confined to a\r\ndirect presentation of the broad political question, which underlay\r\neverything. Washington always went straight to the mark, and he now\r\nsaw, through all the dust of legal and constitutional strife, that\r\nthe only real issue was whether America was to be allowed to govern\r\nherself in her own way or not. In the acts of the ministry he\r\nperceived a policy which aimed at substantial power, and he believed\r\nthat such a policy, if insisted on, could have but one result.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Fairfax County was held in due course, and Washington\r\npresided. The usual resolutions for self-government and against\r\nthe vindictive Massachusetts measures were adopted. Union and\r\nnon-importation were urged; and then the congress, which they\r\nadvocated, was recommended to address a petition and remonstrance to\r\nthe king, and ask him to reflect that \"from our sovereign there can\r\nbe but one appeal.\" Everything was to be tried, everything was to be\r\ndone, but the ultimate appeal was never lost sight of where Washington\r\nappeared, and the final sentence of these Fairfax County resolves is\r\nvery characteristic of the leader in the meeting. Two days later he\r\nwrote to the worthy and still remonstrating Bryan Fairfax, repeating\r\nand enlarging his former questions, and adding: \"Has not General\r\nGage's conduct since his arrival, in stopping the address of his\r\ncouncil, and publishing a proclamation more becoming a Turkish bashaw\r\nthan an English governor, declaring it treason to associate in any\r\nmanner by which the commerce of Great Britain is to be affected,--has\r\nnot this exhibited an unexampled testimony of the most despotic system\r\nof tyranny that ever was practiced in a free government?... Shall we\r\nafter this whine and cry for relief, when we have already tried it in\r\nvain? Or shall we supinely sit and see one province after another fall\r\na sacrifice to despotism?\" The fighting spirit of the man was rising.\r\nThere was no rash rushing forward, no ignorant shouting for war, no\r\nblinking of the real issue, but a foresight that nothing could dim,\r\nand a perception of facts which nothing could confuse. On August 1\r\nWashington was at Williamsburg, to represent his county in the\r\nmeeting of representatives from all Virginia. The convention passed\r\nresolutions like the Fairfax resolves, and chose delegates to a\r\ngeneral congress. The silent man was now warming into action. He \"made\r\nthe most eloquent speech that ever was made,\" and said, \"I will raise\r\na thousand men, subsist them at my own expense, and march them to the\r\nrelief of Boston.\" He was capable, it would seem, of talking to the\r\npurpose with some fire and force, for all he was so quiet and so\r\nretiring. When there was anything to say, he could say it so that it\r\nstirred all who listened, because they felt that there was a mastering\r\nstrength behind the words. He faced the terrible issue solemnly and\r\nfirmly, but his blood was up, the fighting spirit in him was aroused,\r\nand the convention chose him as one of Virginia's six delegates to\r\nthe Continental Congress. He lingered long enough to make a few\r\npreparations at Mount Vernon. He wrote another letter to Fairfax,\r\ninteresting to us as showing the keenness with which he read in the\r\nmeagre news-reports the character of Gage and of the opposing people\r\nof Massachusetts. Then he started for the North to take the first step\r\non the long and difficult path that lay before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTAKING COMMAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the warm days of closing August, a party of three gentlemen rode\r\naway from Mount Vernon one morning, and set out upon their long\r\njourney to Philadelphia. One cannot help wondering whether a tender\r\nand somewhat sad remembrance did not rise in Washington's mind, as he\r\nthought of the last time he had gone northward, nearly twenty years\r\nbefore. Then, he was a light-hearted young soldier, and he and his\r\naides, albeit they went on business, rode gayly through the forests,\r\nlighting the road with the bright colors they wore and with the\r\nglitter of lace and arms, while they anticipated all the pleasures of\r\nyouth in the new lands they were to visit. Now, he was in the prime of\r\nmanhood, looking into the future with prophetic eyes, and sober as was\r\nhis wont when the shadow of coming responsibility lay dark upon his\r\npath. With him went Patrick Henry, four years his junior, and Edmund\r\nPendleton, now past threescore. They were all quiet and grave enough,\r\nno doubt; but Washington, we may believe, was gravest of all, because,\r\nbeing the most truthful of men to himself as to others, he saw more\r\nplainly what was coming. So they made their journey to the North, and\r\non the memorable 5th of September they met with their brethren from\r\nthe other colonies in Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Congress sat fifty-one days, occupied with debates and discussion.\r\nFew abler, more honest, or more memorable bodies of men have ever\r\nassembled to settle the fate of nations. Much debate, great and\r\nearnest in all directions, resulted in a declaration of colonial\r\nrights, in an address to the king, in another to the people of Canada,\r\nand a third to the people of Great Britain; masterly state papers,\r\nseldom surpassed, and extorting even then the admiration of England.\r\nIn these debates and state papers Washington took no part that is now\r\napparent on the face of the record. He was silent in the Congress, and\r\nif he was consulted, as he unquestionably was by the committees, there\r\nis no record of it now. The simple fact was that his time had not\r\ncome. He saw men of the most acute minds, liberal in education,\r\npatriotic in heart, trained in law and in history, doing the work\r\nof the moment in the best possible way. If anything had been done\r\nwrongly, or had been left undone, Washington would have found his\r\nvoice quickly enough, and uttered another of the \"most eloquent\r\nspeeches ever made,\" as he did shortly before in the Virginia\r\nconvention. He could speak in public when need was, but now there was\r\nno need and nothing to arouse him. The work of Congress followed\r\nthe line of policy adopted by the Virginia convention, and that had\r\nproceeded along the path marked out in the Fairfax resolves, so that\r\nWashington could not be other than content. He occupied his own time,\r\nas we see by notes in his diary, in visiting the delegates from\r\nthe other colonies, and in informing himself as to their ideas and\r\npurposes, and those of the people whom they represented. He was\r\nquietly working for the future, the present being well taken care of.\r\nYet this silent man, going hither and thither, and chatting pleasantly\r\nwith this member or that, was in some way or other impressing himself\r\ndeeply on all the delegates, for Patrick Henry said: \"If you speak\r\nof solid information and sound judgment, Colonel Washington is\r\nunquestionably the greatest man on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nWe have a letter, written at just this time, which shows us how\r\nWashington felt, and we see again how his spirit rose as he saw more\r\nand more clearly that the ultimate issue was inevitable. The letter is\r\naddressed to Captain Mackenzie, a British officer at Boston, and an\r\nold friend. \"Permit me,\" he began, \"with the freedom of a friend (for\r\nyou know I always esteemed you), to express my sorrow that fortune\r\nshould place you in a service that must fix curses to the latest\r\nposterity upon the contrivers, and, if success (which, by the by, is\r\nimpossible) accompanies it, execrations upon all those who have been\r\ninstrumental in the execution.\" This was rather uncompromising talk\r\nand not over peaceable, it must be confessed. He continued: \"Give me\r\nleave to add, and I think I can announce it as a fact, that it is not\r\nthe wish or intent of that government [Massachusetts], or any other\r\nupon this continent, separately or collectively, to set up for\r\nindependence; but this you may at the same time rely on, that none\r\nof them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights and\r\nprivileges which are essential to the happiness of every free state,\r\nand without which life, liberty, and property are rendered totally\r\ninsecure.... Again give me leave to add as my opinion that more blood\r\nwill be spilled on this occasion, if the ministry are determined\r\nto push matters to extremity, than history has ever yet furnished\r\ninstances of in the annals of North America, and such a vital wound\r\nwill be given to the peace of this great country, as time itself\r\ncannot cure or eradicate the remembrance of.\" Washington was not a\r\npolitical agitator like Sam Adams, planning with unerring intelligence\r\nto bring about independence. On the contrary, he rightly declared that\r\nindependence was not desired. But although he believed in exhausting\r\nevery argument and every peaceful remedy, it is evident that he felt\r\nthat there now could be but one result, and that violent separation\r\nfrom the mother country was inevitable. Here is where he differed from\r\nhis associates and from the great mass of the people, and it is to\r\nthis entire veracity of mind that his wisdom and foresight were so\r\nlargely due, as well as his success when the time came for him to put\r\nhis hand to the plough.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, to the\r\npursuits and pleasures that he loved, to his family and farm, and to\r\nhis horses and hounds, with whom he had many a good run, the last that\r\nhe was to enjoy for years to come. He returned also to wait and\r\nwatch as before, and to see war rapidly gather in the east. When the\r\nVirginia convention again assembled, resolutions were introduced to\r\narm and discipline men, and Henry declared in their support that\r\nan \"appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts\" was all that was left.\r\nWashington said nothing, but he served on the committee to draft a\r\nplan of defense, and then fell to reviewing the independent companies\r\nwhich were springing up everywhere. At the same time he wrote to his\r\nbrother John, who had raised a troop, that he would accept the command\r\nof it if desired, as it was his \"full intention to devote his life and\r\nfortune in the cause we are engaged in, if needful.\" At Mount Vernon\r\nhis old comrades of the French war began to appear, in search of\r\ncourage and sympathy. Thither, too, came Charles Lee, a typical\r\nmilitary adventurer of that period, a man of English birth and of\r\nvaried service, brilliant, whimsical, and unbalanced. There also came\r\nHoratio Gates, likewise British, and disappointed with his prospects\r\nat home; less adventurous than Lee, but also less brilliant, and not\r\nmuch more valuable.\r\n\r\nThus the winter wore away; spring opened, and toward the end of April\r\nWashington started again for the North, much occupied with certain\r\ntidings from Lexington and Concord which just then spread over the\r\nland. He saw all that it meant plainly enough, and after noting the\r\nfact that the colonists fought and fought well, he wrote to George\r\nFairfax in England: \"Unhappy it is to reflect that a brother's sword\r\nhas been sheathed in a brother's breast, and that the once happy and\r\npeaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or\r\ninhabited by slaves. Sad alternative. But can a virtuous man hesitate\r\nin his choice?\" Congress, it would seem, thought there was a good deal\r\nof room for hesitation, both for virtuous men and others, and after\r\nthe fashion of their race determined to do a little more debating and\r\narguing, before taking any decisive step. After much resistance and\r\ndiscussion, a second \"humble and dutiful petition\" to the king was\r\nadopted, and with strange contradiction a confederation was formed at\r\nthe same time, and Congress proceeded to exercise the sovereign powers\r\nthus vested in them. The most pressing and troublesome question before\r\nthem was what to do with the army surrounding Boston, and with the\r\nactual hostilities there existing.\r\n\r\nWashington, for his part, went quietly about as before, saying\r\nnothing and observing much, working hard as chairman of the military\r\ncommittees, planning for defense, and arranging for raising an army.\r\nOne act of his alone stands out for us with significance at this\r\ncritical time. In this second Congress he appeared habitually on the\r\nfloor in his blue and buff uniform of a Virginia colonel. It was his\r\nway of saying that the hour for action had come, and that he at least\r\nwas ready for the fight whenever called upon.\r\n\r\nPresently he was summoned. Weary of waiting, John Adams at last\r\ndeclared that Congress must adopt the army and make Washington, who at\r\nthis mention of his name stepped out of the room, commander-in-chief.\r\nOn June 15, formal motions were made to this effect and unanimously\r\nadopted, and the next day Washington appeared before Congress and\r\naccepted the trust. His words were few and simple. He expressed his\r\nsense of his own insufficiency for the task before him, and said that\r\nas no pecuniary consideration could have induced him to undertake the\r\nwork, he must decline all pay or emoluments, only looking to Congress\r\nto defray his expenses. In the same spirit he wrote to his soldiers\r\nin Virginia, to his brother, and finally, in terms at once simple\r\nand pathetic, to his wife. There was no pretense about this, but the\r\nsternest reality of self-distrust, for Washington saw and measured as\r\ndid no one else the magnitude of the work before him. He knew that he\r\nwas about to face the best troops of Europe, and he had learned by\r\nexperience that after the first excitement was over he would be\r\nobliged to rely upon a people who were brave and patriotic, but also\r\nundisciplined, untrained, and unprepared for war, without money,\r\nwithout arms, without allies or credit, and torn by selfish local\r\ninterests. Nobody else perceived all this as he was able to with his\r\nmastery of facts, but he faced the duty unflinchingly. He did not put\r\nit aside because he distrusted himself, for in his truthfulness he\r\ncould not but confess that no other American could show one tithe\r\nof his capacity, experience, or military service. He knew what was\r\ncoming, knew it, no doubt, when he first put on his uniform, and he\r\naccepted instantly.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams in his autobiography speaks of the necessity of choosing a\r\nSouthern general, and also says there were objectors to the selection\r\nof Washington even among the Virginia delegates. That there were\r\npolitical reasons for taking a Virginian cannot be doubted. But the\r\ndissent, even if it existed, never appeared on the surface, excepting\r\nin the case of John Hancock, who, with curious vanity, thought that he\r\nought to have this great place. When Washington's name was proposed\r\nthere was no murmur of opposition, for there was no man who could for\r\none moment be compared with him in fitness. The choice was inevitable,\r\nand he himself felt it to be so. He saw it coming; he would fain have\r\navoided the great task, but no thought of shrinking crossed his mind.\r\nHe saw with his entire freedom from constitutional subtleties that an\r\nabsolute parliament sought to extend its power to the colonies. To\r\nthis he would not submit, and he knew that this was a question which\r\ncould be settled only by one side giving way, or by the dread appeal\r\nto arms. It was a question of fact, hard, unrelenting fact, now to be\r\ndetermined by battle, and on him had fallen the burden of sustaining\r\nthe cause of his country. In this spirit he accepted his commission,\r\nand rode forth to review the troops. He was greeted with loud acclaim\r\nwherever he appeared. Mankind is impressed by externals, and those\r\nwho gazed upon Washington in the streets of Philadelphia felt their\r\ncourage rise and their hearts grow strong at the sight of his virile,\r\nmuscular figure as he passed before them on horseback, stately,\r\ndignified, and self-contained. The people looked upon him, and were\r\nconfident that this was a man worthy and able to dare and do all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nOn June 21 he set forth accompanied by Lee and Schuyler, and with a\r\nbrilliant escort. He had ridden but twenty miles when he was met by\r\nthe news of Bunker Hill. \"Did the militia fight?\" was the immediate\r\nand characteristic question; and being told that they did fight, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Then the liberties of the country are safe.\" Given the\r\nfighting spirit, Washington felt he could do anything. Full of this\r\nimportant intelligence he pressed forward to Newark, where he was\r\nreceived by a committee of the provincial congress, sent to conduct\r\nthe commander-in-chief to New York. There he tarried long enough to\r\nappoint Schuyler to the charge of the military affairs in that colony,\r\nhaving mastered on the journey its complicated social and political\r\nconditions. Pushing on through Connecticut he reached Watertown, where\r\nhe was received by the provincial congress of Massachusetts, on July\r\n2, with every expression of attachment and confidence. Lingering less\r\nthan an hour for this ceremony, he rode on to the headquarters at\r\nCambridge, and when he came within the lines the shouts of the\r\nsoldiers and the booming of cannon announced his arrival to the\r\nEnglish in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe next day he rode forth in the presence of a great multitude, and\r\nthe troops having been drawn up before him, he drew his sword beneath\r\nthe historical elm-tree, and took command of the first American army.\r\n\"His excellency,\" wrote Dr. Thatcher in his journal, \"was on horseback\r\nin company with several military gentlemen. It was not difficult to\r\ndistinguish him from all others. He is tall and well proportioned, and\r\nhis personal appearance truly noble and majestic.\" \"He is tall and of\r\neasy and agreeable address,\" the loyalist Curwen had remarked a few\r\nweeks before; while Mrs. John Adams, warm-hearted and clever, wrote\r\nto her husband after the general's arrival: \"Dignity, ease, and\r\ncomplacency, the gentleman and the soldier, look agreeably blended in\r\nhim. Modesty marks every line and feature of his face. Those lines of\r\nDryden instantly occurred to me,--\r\n\r\n  'Mark his majestic fabric! He's a temple\r\n  Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine;\r\n  His soul's the deity that lodges there;\r\n  Nor is the pile unworthy of the God.'\"\r\n\r\nLady, lawyer, and surgeon, patriot and tory, all speak alike, and as\r\nthey wrote so New England felt. A slave-owner, an aristocrat, and a\r\nchurchman, Washington came to Cambridge to pass over the heads\r\nof native generals to the command of a New England army, among a\r\ndemocratic people, hard-working and simple in their lives, and\r\ndissenters to the backbone, who regarded episcopacy as something\r\nlittle short of papistry and quite equivalent to toryism. Yet the\r\nshout that went up from soldiers and people on Cambridge common on\r\nthat pleasant July morning came from the heart and had no jarring\r\nnote. A few of the political chiefs growled a little in later days at\r\nWashington, but the soldiers and the people, high and low, rich and\r\npoor, gave him an unstinted loyalty. On the fields of battle and\r\nthroughout eight years of political strife the men of New England\r\nstood by the great Virginian with a devotion and truth in which was no\r\nshadow of turning. Here again we see exhibited most conspicuously\r\nthe powerful personality of the man who was able thus to command\r\nimmediately the allegiance of this naturally cold and reserved people.\r\nWhat was it that they saw which inspired them at once with so much\r\nconfidence? They looked upon a tall, handsome man, dressed in plain\r\nuniform, wearing across his breast a broad blue band of silk, which\r\nsome may have noticed as the badge and symbol of a certain solemn\r\nleague and covenant once very momentous in the English-speaking world.\r\nThey saw his calm, high bearing, and in every line of face and figure\r\nthey beheld the signs of force and courage. Yet there must have been\r\nsomething more to call forth the confidence then so quickly given, and\r\nwhich no one ever long withheld. All felt dimly, but none the less\r\nsurely, that here was a strong, able man, capable of rising to the\r\nemergency, whatever it might be, capable of continued growth and\r\ndevelopment, clear of head and warm of heart; and so the New England\r\npeople gave to him instinctively their sympathy and their faith, and\r\nnever took either back.\r\n\r\nThe shouts and cheers died away, and then Washington returned to his\r\ntemporary quarters in the Wadsworth house, to master the task before\r\nhim. The first great test of his courage and ability had come, and he\r\nfaced it quietly as the excitement caused by his arrival passed by. He\r\nsaw before him, to use his own words, \"a mixed multitude of people,\r\nunder very little discipline, order, or government.\" In the language\r\nof one of his aides:[1] \"The entire army, if it deserved the name, was\r\nbut an assemblage of brave, enthusiastic, undisciplined, country lads;\r\nthe officers in general quite as ignorant of military life as the\r\ntroops, excepting a few elderly men, who had seen some irregular\r\nservice among the provincials under Lord Amherst.\" With this force,\r\nill-posted and very insecurely fortified, Washington was to drive the\r\nBritish from Boston. His first step was to count his men, and it took\r\neight days to get the necessary returns, which in an ordinary army\r\nwould have been furnished in an hour. When he had them, he found that\r\ninstead of twenty thousand, as had been represented, but fourteen\r\nthousand soldiers were actually present for duty. In a short time,\r\nhowever, Mr. Emerson, the chaplain, noted in his diary that it\r\nwas surprising how much had been done, that the lines had been so\r\nextended, and the works so shrewdly built, that it was morally\r\nimpossible for the enemy to get out except in one place purposely left\r\nopen. A little later the same observer remarked: \"There is a great\r\noverturning in the camp as to order and regularity; new lords, new\r\nlaws. The Generals Washington and Lee are upon the lines every day.\r\nThe strictest government is taking place, and great distinction is\r\nmade between officers and soldiers.\" Bodies of troops scattered here\r\nand there by chance were replaced by well-distributed forces, posted\r\nwisely and effectively in strong intrenchments. It is little wonder\r\nthat the worthy chaplain was impressed, and now, seeing it all from\r\nevery side, we too can watch order come out of chaos and mark the\r\ngrowth of an army under the guidance of a master-mind and the steady\r\npressure of an unbending will.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: John Trumbull, _Reminiscences_, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nThen too there was no discipline, for the army was composed of raw\r\nmilitia, who elected their officers and carried on war as they\r\npleased. In a passage suppressed by Mr. Sparks, Washington said:\r\n\"There is no such thing as getting officers of this stamp to carry\r\norders into execution--to curry favor with the men (by whom they were\r\nchosen, and on whose smile they may possibly think that they may again\r\nrely) seems to be one of the principal objects of their attention.\r\nI have made a pretty good slam amongst such kind of officers as the\r\nMassachusetts government abounds in, since I came into this camp,\r\nhaving broke one colonel and two captains for cowardly behavior in\r\nthe action on Bunker Hill, two captains for drawing more pay and\r\nprovisions than they had men in their company, and one for being\r\nabsent from his post when the enemy appeared there and burnt a house\r\njust by it. Besides these I have at this time one colonel, one major,\r\none captain, and two subalterns under arrest for trial. In short, I\r\nspare none, and yet fear it will not all do, as these people seem to\r\nbe too attentive to everything but their own interests.\" This may\r\nbe plain and homely in phrase, but it is not stilted, and the quick\r\nenergy of the words shows how the New England farmers and fishermen\r\nwere being rapidly brought to discipline. Bringing the army into\r\norder, however, was but a small part of his duties. It is necessary\r\nto run over all his difficulties, great and small, at this time, and\r\ncount them up, in order to gain a just idea of the force and capacity\r\nof the man who overcame them.\r\n\r\nWashington, in the first place, was obliged to deal not only with his\r\narmy, but with the general congress and the congress of the province.\r\nHe had to teach them, utterly ignorant as they were of the needs and\r\ndetails of war, how to organize and supply their armies. There was no\r\ncommissary department, there were no uniforms, no arrangements for\r\nammunition, no small arms, no cannon, no resources to draw upon for\r\nall these necessaries of war. Little by little he taught Congress\r\nto provide after a fashion for these things, little by little he\r\ndeveloped what he needed, and by his own ingenuity, and by seizing\r\nalertly every suggestion from others, he supplied for better or worse\r\none deficiency after another. He had to deal with various governors\r\nand various colonies, each with its prejudices, jealousies, and\r\nshortcomings. He had to arrange for new levies from a people unused\r\nto war, and to settle with infinite anxiety and much wear and tear of\r\nmind and body, the conflict as to rank among officers to whom he could\r\napply no test but his own insight. He had to organize and stimulate\r\nthe arming of privateers, which, by preying on British commerce, were\r\ndestined to exercise such a powerful influence on the fate of the war.\r\nIt was neither showy nor attractive, such work as this, but it was\r\nvery vital, and it was done.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July the army was in a better posture of defense;\r\nand then at the beginning of the next month, as the prospect was\r\nbrightening, it was suddenly discovered that there was no gunpowder.\r\nAn undrilled army, imperfectly organized, was facing a disciplined\r\nforce and had only some nine rounds in the cartridge-boxes. Yet there\r\nis no quivering in the letters from headquarters. Anxiety and strain\r\nof nerve are apparent; but a resolute determination rises over all,\r\nsupported by a ready fertility of resource. Couriers flew over the\r\ncountry asking for powder in every town and in every village. A vessel\r\nwas even dispatched to the Bermudas to seize there a supply of powder,\r\nof which the general, always listening, had heard. Thus the immediate\r\nand grinding pressure was presently relieved, but the staple of war\r\nstill remained pitifully and perilously meagre all through the winter.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while thus overwhelmed with the cares immediately about him,\r\nWashington was watching the rest of the country. He had a keen eye\r\nupon Johnson and his Indians in the valley of the Mohawk; he followed\r\nsharply every movement of Tryon and the Tories in New York; he refused\r\nwith stern good sense to detach troops to Connecticut and Long Island,\r\nknowing well when to give and when to say No, a difficult monosyllable\r\nfor the new general of freshly revolted colonies. But if he would not\r\ndetach in one place, he was ready enough to do so in another. He sent\r\none expedition by Lake Champlain, under Montgomery, to Montreal, and\r\ngave Arnold picked troops to march through the wilds of Maine and\r\nstrike Quebec. The scheme was bold and brilliant, both in conception\r\nand in execution, and came very near severing Canada forever from the\r\nBritish crown. A chapter of little accidents, each one of which proved\r\nas fatal as it was unavoidable, a moment's delay on the Plains of\r\nAbraham, and the whole campaign failed; but there was a grasp of\r\nconditions, a clearness of perception, and a comprehensiveness about\r\nthe plan, which stamp it as the work of a great soldier, who saw\r\nbesides the military importance, the enormous political value held out\r\nby the chance of such a victory.\r\n\r\nThe daring, far-reaching quality of this Canadian expedition was much\r\nmore congenial to Washington's temper and character than the wearing\r\nwork of the siege. All that man could do before Boston was done, and\r\nstill Congress expected the impossible, and grumbled because without\r\nships he did not secure the harbor. He himself, while he inwardly\r\nresented such criticism, chafed under the monotonous drudgery of the\r\nintrenchments. He was longing, according to his nature, to fight, and\r\nwas, it must be confessed, quite ready to attempt the impossible in\r\nhis own way. Early in September he proposed to attack the town in\r\nboats and by the neck of land at Roxbury, but the council of officers\r\nunanimously voted against him. A little more than a month later he\r\nplanned another attack, and was again voted down by his officers.\r\nCouncils of war never fight, it is said, and perhaps in this case\r\nit was well that such was their habit, for the schemes look rather\r\ndesperate now. To us they serve to show the temper of the man, and\r\nalso his self-control in this respect at the beginning of the war, for\r\nWashington became ready enough afterwards to override councils when he\r\nwas wholly free from doubt himself.\r\n\r\nThus the planning of campaigns, both distant and near, went on, and at\r\nthe same time the current of details, difficult, vital, absolute in\r\ndemanding prompt and vigorous solution, went on too. The existence of\r\nwar made it necessary to fix our relations with our enemies, and that\r\nthese relations should be rightly settled was of vast moment to our\r\ncause, struggling for recognition. The first question was the matter\r\nof prisoners, and on August 11 Washington wrote to Gage:--\r\n\r\n\"I understand that the officers engaged in the cause of liberty and\r\ntheir country, who by the fortune of war have fallen into your hands,\r\nhave been thrown indiscriminately into a common gaol appropriated\r\nfor felons; that no consideration has been had for those of the most\r\nrespectable rank, when languishing with wounds and sickness; and that\r\nsome have been even amputated in this unworthy situation.\r\n\r\n\"Let your opinion, sir, of the principle which actuates them be what\r\nit may, they suppose that they act from the noblest of all principles,\r\na love of freedom and their country. But political principles, I\r\nconceive, are foreign to this point. The obligations arising from the\r\nrights of humanity and claims of rank are universally binding and\r\nextensive, except in case of retaliation. These, I should have hoped,\r\nwould have dictated a more tender treatment of those individuals whom\r\nchance or war had put in your power. Nor can I forbear suggesting\r\nits fatal tendency to widen that unhappy breach which you, and those\r\nministers under whom you act, have repeatedly declared your wish is to\r\nsee forever closed.\r\n\r\n\"My duty now makes it necessary to apprise you, that for the future I\r\nshall regulate all my conduct towards those gentlemen who are or may\r\nbe in our possession, exactly by the rule you shall observe towards\r\nthose of ours now in your custody.\r\n\r\n\"If severity and hardship mark the line of your conduct, painful as it\r\nmay be to me, your prisoners will feel its effects. But if kindness\r\nand humanity are shown to ours, I shall with pleasure consider those\r\nin our hands only as unfortunate, and they shall receive from me that\r\ntreatment to which the unfortunate are ever entitled.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a letter worthy of a little study. The affair does not look\r\nvery important now, but it went then to the roots of things; for this\r\nletter would go out to the world, and America and the American cause\r\nwould be judged by their leader. A little bluster or ferocity, any\r\nfine writing, or any absurdity, and the world would have sneered,\r\ncondemned, or laughed. But no man could read this letter and fail to\r\nperceive that here was dignity and force, justice and sense, with just\r\na touch of pathos and eloquence to recommend it to the heart. Men\r\nmight differ with the writer, but they could neither laugh at him nor\r\nset him aside.\r\n\r\nGage replied after his kind. He was an inconsiderable person, dull\r\nand well meaning, intended for the command of a garrison town,\r\nand terribly twisted and torn by the great events in which he was\r\nmomentarily caught. His masters were stupid and arrogant, and he\r\nimitated them with perfect success, except that arrogance with him\r\ndwindled to impertinence. He answered Washington's letter with denials\r\nand recriminations, lectured the American general on the political\r\nsituation, and talked about \"usurped authority,\" \"rebels,\"\r\n\"criminals,\" and persons destined to the \"cord.\" Washington, being a\r\nman of his word, proceeded to put some English prisoners into jail,\r\nand then wrote a second note, giving Gage a little lesson in manners,\r\nwith the vain hope of making him see that gentlemen did not scold\r\nand vituperate because they fought. He restated his case calmly\r\nand coolly, as before, informed Gage that he had investigated the\r\ncounter-charge of cruelty and found it without any foundation, and\r\nthen continued: \"You advise me to give free operation to truth, and\r\nto punish misrepresentation and falsehood. If experience stamps value\r\nupon counsel, yours must have a weight which few can claim. You best\r\ncan tell how far the convulsion, which has brought such ruin on both\r\ncountries, and shaken the mighty empire of Britain to its foundation,\r\nmay be traced to these malignant causes.\r\n\r\n\"You affect, sir, to despise all rank not derived from the same source\r\nwith your own. I cannot conceive one more honorable than that which\r\nflows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people, the\r\npurest source and original fountain of all power. Far from making it a\r\nplea for cruelty, a mind of true magnanimity and enlarged ideas would\r\ncomprehend and respect it.\"\r\n\r\nWashington had grasped instinctively the general truth that Englishmen\r\nare prone to mistake civility for servility, and become offensive,\r\nwhereas if they are treated with indifference, rebuke, or even\r\nrudeness, they are apt to be respectful and polite. He was obliged to\r\ngo over the same ground with Sir William Howe, a little later, and\r\nstill more sharply; and this matter of prisoners recurred, although at\r\nlonger and longer intervals, throughout the war. But as the British\r\ngenerals saw their officers go to jail, and found that their impudence\r\nand assumption were met by keen reproofs, they gradually comprehended\r\nthat Washington was not a man to be trifled with, and that in him\r\nwas a pride and dignity out-topping theirs and far stronger, because\r\ngrounded on responsibility borne and work done, and on the deep sense\r\nof a great and righteous cause.\r\n\r\nIt was probably a pleasure and a relief to give to Gage and Sir\r\nWilliam Howe a little instruction in military behavior and general\r\ngood manners, but there was nothing save infinite vexation in dealing\r\nwith the difficulties arising on the American side of the line. As the\r\ndays shortened and the leaves fell, Washington saw before him a New\r\nEngland winter, with no clothing and no money for his troops. Through\r\nlong letters to Congress, and strenuous personal efforts, these\r\nwants were somehow supplied. Then the men began to get restless and\r\nhomesick, and both privates and officers would disappear to their\r\nfarms, which Washington, always impatient of wrongdoing, styled \"base\r\nand pernicious conduct,\" and punished accordingly. By and by the terms\r\nof enlistment ran out and the regiments began to melt away even before\r\nthe proper date. Recruiting was carried on slowly and with difficulty,\r\nnew levies were tardy in coming in, and Congress could not be\r\npersuaded to stop limited enlistments. Still the task was done. The\r\nold army departed and a new one arose in its place, the posts were\r\nstrengthened and ammunition secured.\r\n\r\nAmong these reinforcements came some Virginia riflemen, and it must\r\nhave warmed Washington's heart to see once more these brave and hardy\r\nfighters in the familiar hunting shirt and leggins. They certainly\r\nmade him warm in a very different sense by getting into a\r\nrough-and-tumble fight one winter's day with some Marblehead\r\nfishermen. The quarrel was at its height, when suddenly into the brawl\r\nrode the commander-in-chief. He quickly dismounted, seized two of the\r\ncombatants, shook them, berated them, if tradition may be trusted,\r\nfor their local jealousies, and so with strong arm quelled the\r\ndisturbance. He must have longed to take more than one colonial\r\ngovernor or magnate by the throat and shake him soundly, as he did his\r\nsoldiers from the woods of Virginia and the rocks of Marblehead, for\r\nto his temper there was nothing so satisfying as rapid and decisive\r\naction. But he could not quell governors and assemblies in this way,\r\nand yet he managed them and got what he wanted with a patience and\r\ntact which it must have been in the last degree trying to him to\r\npractice, gifted as he was with a nature at once masterful and\r\npassionate.\r\n\r\nAnother trial was brought about by his securing and sending out\r\nprivateers which did good service. They brought in many valuable\r\nprizes which caused infinite trouble, and forced Washington not only\r\nto be a naval secretary, but also made him a species of admiralty\r\njudge. He implored the slow-moving Congress to relieve him from this\r\nburden, and suggested a plan which led to the formation of special\r\ncommittees and was the origin of the Federal judiciary of the United\r\nStates. Besides the local jealousies and the personal jealousies, and\r\nthe privateers and their prizes, he had to meet also the greed and\r\nselfishness as well of the money-making, stock-jobbing spirit which\r\nsprings up rankly under the influence of army contracts and large\r\nexpenditures among a people accustomed to trade and unused to war.\r\nWashington wrote savagely of these practices, but still, despite all\r\nhindrances and annoyances, he kept moving straight on to his object.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his labors, harassed and tried in all ways, he was\r\nassailed as usual by complaint and criticism. Some of it came to him\r\nthrough his friend and aide, Joseph Reed, to whom he wrote in reply\r\none of the noblest letters ever penned by a great man struggling with\r\nadverse circumstances and wringing victory from grudging fortune. He\r\nsaid that he was always ready to welcome criticism, hear advice, and\r\nlearn the opinion of the world. \"For as I have but one capital object\r\nin view, I could wish to make my conduct coincide with the wishes of\r\nmankind, as far as I can consistently; I mean, without departing from\r\nthat great line of duty which, though hid under a cloud for some\r\ntime, from a peculiarity of circumstances, may, nevertheless, bear\r\na scrutiny.\" Thus he held fast to \"the great line of duty,\" though\r\nbitterly tried the while by the news from Canada, where brilliant\r\nbeginnings were coming to dismal endings, and cheered only by the\r\narrival of his wife, who drove up one day in her coach and four, with\r\nthe horses ridden by black postilions in scarlet and white liveries,\r\nmuch to the amazement, no doubt, of the sober-minded New England folk.\r\n\r\nLight, however, finally began to break on the work about him. Henry\r\nKnox, sent out for that purpose, returned safely with the guns\r\ncaptured at Ticonderoga, and thus heavy ordnance and gunpowder were\r\nobtained. By the middle of February the harbor was frozen over, and\r\nWashington arranged to cross the ice and carry Boston by storm.\r\nAgain he was held back by his council, but this time he could not be\r\nstopped. If he could not cross the ice he would go by land. He had\r\nbeen slowly but surely advancing his works all winter, and now he\r\ndetermined on a decisive stroke. On the evening of Monday, March\r\n4, under cover of a heavy bombardment which distracted the enemy's\r\nattention, he marched a large body of troops to Dorchester Heights\r\nand began to throw up redoubts. The work went forward rapidly, and\r\nWashington rode about all night encouraging the men. The New England\r\nsoldiers had sorely tried his temper, and there were many severe\r\nattacks and bitter criticisms upon them in his letters, which were\r\nsuppressed or smoothed over for the most part by Mr. Sparks, but\r\nwhich have come to light since, as is sometimes the case with facts.\r\nGradually, however, the General had come to know his soldiers better,\r\nand six months later he wrote to Lund Washington, praising his\r\nnorthern troops in the highest terms. Even now he understood them as\r\nnever before, and as he watched them on that raw March night, working\r\nwith the energy and quick intelligence of their race, he probably felt\r\nthat the defects were superficial, but the virtues, the tenacity, and\r\nthe courage were lasting and strong.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned, and the British caught sight of the formidable works\r\nwhich had sprung up in the night, there was a great excitement and\r\nrunning hither and thither in the town. Still the men on the heights\r\nworked on, and still Washington rode back and forth among them. He was\r\nstirred and greatly rejoiced at the coming of the fight, which he now\r\nbelieved inevitable, and as always, when he was deeply moved, the\r\nhidden springs of sentiment and passion were opened, and he reminded\r\nhis soldiers that it was the anniversary of the Boston massacre, and\r\nappealed to them by the memories of that day to prepare for battle\r\nwith the enemy. As with the Huguenots at Ivry,--\r\n\r\n  \"Remember St. Bartholomew was passed from man to man.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fighting never came. The British troops were made ready, then\r\na gale arose and they could not cross the bay. The next day it\r\nrained in torrents, and the next day it was too late. The American\r\nintrenchments frowned threateningly above the town, and began to send\r\nin certain ominous messengers in the shape of shot and shell. The\r\nplace was now so clearly untenable that Howe determined to evacuate\r\nit. An informal request to allow the troops to depart unmolested was\r\nnot answered, but Washington suspended his fire and the British made\r\nready to withdraw. Still they hesitated and delayed, until Washington\r\nagain advanced his works, and on this hint they started in earnest, on\r\nMarch 17, amid confusion, pillage, and disorder, leaving cannon and\r\nmuch else behind them, and seeking refuge in their ships.\r\n\r\nAll was over, and the town was in the hands of the Americans. In\r\nWashington's own words, \"To maintain a post within musket-shot of the\r\nenemy for six months together, without powder, and at the same time\r\nto disband one army and recruit another within that distance of\r\ntwenty-odd British regiments, is more, probably, than ever was\r\nattempted.\" It was, in truth, a gallant feat of arms, carried through\r\nby the resolute will and strong brain of one man. The troops on\r\nboth sides were brave, but the British had advantages far more than\r\ncompensating for a disparity of numbers, always slight and often\r\nmore imaginary than real. They had twelve thousand men, experienced,\r\ndisciplined, equipped, and thoroughly supplied. They had the best arms\r\nand cannon and gunpowder. They commanded the sea with a strong fleet,\r\nand they were concentrated on the inside line, able to strike with\r\nsuddenness and overwhelming force at any point of widely extended\r\nposts. Washington caught them with an iron grip and tightened it\r\nsteadily until, in disorderly haste, they took to their boats without\r\neven striking a blow. Washington's great abilities, and the incapacity\r\nof the generals opposed to him, were the causes of this result. If\r\nRobert Clive, for instance, had chanced to have been there the end\r\nmight possibly have been the same, but there would have been some\r\nbloody fighting before that end was reached. The explanation of the\r\nfeeble abandonment of Boston lies in the stupidity of the English\r\ngovernment, which had sown the wind and then proceeded to handle the\r\ncustomary crop with equal fatuity.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of great men in England, but they were not\r\nconducting her government or her armies. Lord Sandwich had declared\r\nin the House of Lords that all \"Yankees were cowards,\" a simple and\r\nsatisfactory statement, readily accepted by the governing classes, and\r\nflung in the teeth of the British soldiers as they fell back twice\r\nfrom the bloody slopes of Bunker Hill. Acting on this pleasant idea,\r\nEngland sent out as commanders of her American army a parcel of\r\nministerial and court favorites, thoroughly second-rate men, to whom\r\nwas confided the task of beating one of the best soldiers and hardest\r\nfighters of the century. Despite the enormous material odds in favor\r\nof Great Britain, the natural result of matching the Howes and Gages\r\nand Clintons against George Washington ensued, and the first lesson\r\nwas taught by the evacuation of Boston.\r\n\r\nWashington did not linger over his victory. Even while the British\r\nfleet still hung about the harbor he began to send troops to New York\r\nto make ready for the next attack. He entered Boston in order to see\r\nthat every precaution was taken against the spread of the smallpox,\r\nand then prepared to depart himself. Two ideas, during his first\r\nwinter of conflict, had taken possession of his mind, and undoubtedly\r\ninfluenced profoundly his future course. One was the conviction that\r\nthe struggle must be fought out to the bitter end, and must bring\r\neither subjugation or complete independence. He wrote in February:\r\n\"With respect to myself, I have never entertained an idea of an\r\naccommodation, since I heard of the measures which were adopted in\r\nconsequence of the Bunker's Hill fight;\" and at an earlier date he\r\nsaid: \"I hope my countrymen (of Virginia) will rise superior to any\r\nlosses the whole navy of Great Britain can bring on them, and that the\r\ndestruction of Norfolk and threatened devastation of other places\r\nwill have no other effect than to unite the whole country in one\r\nindissoluble band against a nation which seems to be lost to every\r\nsense of virtue and those feelings which distinguish a civilized\r\npeople from the most barbarous savages.\" With such thoughts he\r\nsought to make Congress appreciate the probable long duration of the\r\nstruggle, and he bent every energy to giving permanency to his army,\r\nand decisiveness to each campaign. The other idea which had grown in\r\nhis mind during the weary siege was that the Tories were thoroughly\r\ndangerous and deserved scant mercy. In his second letter to Gage he\r\nrefers to them, with the frankness which characterized him when he\r\nfelt strongly, as \"execrable parricides,\" and he made ready to\r\ntreat them with the utmost severity at New York and elsewhere. When\r\nWashington was aroused there was a stern and relentless side to his\r\ncharacter, in keeping with the force and strength which were his chief\r\nqualities. His attitude on this point seems harsh now when the\r\nold Tories no longer look very dreadful and we can appreciate the\r\nsincerity of conviction which no doubt controlled most of them. But\r\nthey were dangerous then, and Washington, with his honest hatred of\r\nall that seemed to him to partake of meanness or treason, proposed to\r\nput them down and render them harmless, being well convinced, after\r\nhis clear-sighted fashion, that war was not peace, and that mildness\r\nto domestic foes was sadly misplaced.\r\n\r\nHis errand to New England was now done and well done. His victory was\r\nwon, everything was settled at Boston; and so, having sent his army\r\nforward, he started for New York, to meet the harder trials that still\r\nawaited him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSAVING THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Boston, Washington proceeded through Rhode Island and\r\nConnecticut, pushing troops forward as he advanced, and reached New\r\nYork on April 13. There he found himself plunged at once into the same\r\nsea of difficulties with which he had been struggling at Boston, the\r\nonly difference being that these were fresh and entirely untouched.\r\nThe army was inadequate, and the town, which was the central point\r\nof the colonies, as well as the great river at its side, was wholly\r\nunprotected. The troops were in large measure raw and undrilled, the\r\ncommittee of safety was hesitating, the Tories were virulent and\r\nactive, corresponding constantly with Tryon, who was lurking in a\r\nBritish man-of-war, while from the north came tidings of retreat\r\nand disaster. All these harassing difficulties crowded upon the\r\ncommander-in-chief as soon as he arrived. To appreciate him it is\r\nnecessary to understand these conditions and realize their weight and\r\nconsequence, albeit the details seem petty. When we comprehend the\r\ndifficulties, then we can see plainly the greatness of the man who\r\nquietly and silently took them up and disposed of them. Some he\r\nscotched and some he killed, but he dealt with them all after a\r\nfashion sufficient to enable him to move steadily forward. In his\r\npresence the provincial committee suddenly stiffened and grew strong.\r\nAll correspondence with Tryon was cut off, the Tories were repressed,\r\nand on Long Island steps were taken to root out \"these abominable\r\npests of society,\" as the commander-in-chief called them in his\r\nplain-spoken way. Then forts were built, soldiers energetically\r\nrecruited and drilled, arrangements made for prisoners, and despite\r\nall the present cares anxious thought was given to the Canada\r\ncampaign, and ideas and expeditions, orders, suggestions, and\r\nencouragement were freely furnished to the dispirited generals and\r\nbroken forces of the north.\r\n\r\nOne matter, however, overshadowed all others. Nearly a year before,\r\nWashington had seen that there was no prospect or possibility of\r\naccommodation with Great Britain. It was plain to his mind that the\r\nstruggle was final in its character and would be decisive. Separation\r\nfrom the mother country, therefore, ought to come at once, so that\r\npublic opinion might be concentrated, and above all, permanency ought\r\nto be given to the army. These ideas he had been striving to impress\r\nupon Congress, for the most part less clearsighted than he was as to\r\nfacts, and as the months slipped by his letters had grown constantly\r\nmore earnest and more vehement. Still Congress hesitated, and at last\r\nWashington went himself to Philadelphia and held conferences with\r\nthe principal men. What he said is lost, but the tone of Congress\r\ncertainly rose after his visit. The aggressive leaders found their\r\nhands so much strengthened that little more than a month later they\r\ncarried through a declaration of independence, which was solemnly and\r\ngratefully proclaimed to the army by the general, much relieved to\r\nhave got through the necessary boat-burning, and to have brought\r\naffairs, military and political, on to the hard ground of actual fact.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from Philadelphia, he received convincing\r\nproof that his views in regard to the Tories were extremely sound.\r\nA conspiracy devised by Tryon, which aimed apparently at the\r\nassassination of the commander-in-chief, and which had corrupted his\r\nlife-guards for that purpose, was discovered and scattered before it\r\nhad fairly hardened into definite form. The mayor of the city and\r\nvarious other persons were seized and thrown into prison, and one of\r\nthe life-guards, Thomas Hickey by name, who was the principal tool in\r\nthe plot, was hanged in the presence of a large concourse of people.\r\nWashington wrote a brief and business-like account of the affair to\r\nCongress, from which one would hardly suppose that his own life had\r\nbeen aimed at. It is a curious instance of his cool indifference to\r\npersonal danger. The conspiracy had failed, that was sufficient for\r\nhim, and he had other things besides himself to consider. \"We expect\r\na bloody summer in New York and Canada,\" he wrote to his brother, and\r\neven while the Canadian expedition was coming to a disastrous close,\r\nand was bringing hostile invasion instead of the hoped-for conquest,\r\nBritish men-of-war were arriving daily in the harbor, and a large army\r\nwas collecting on Staten Island. The rejoicings over the Declaration\r\nof Independence had hardly died away, when the vessels of the enemy\r\nmade their way up the Hudson without check from the embryo forts, or\r\nthe obstacles placed in the stream.\r\n\r\nJuly 12 Lord Howe arrived with more troops, and also with ample\r\npowers to pardon and negotiate. Almost immediately he tried to open\r\na correspondence with Washington, but Colonel Reed, in behalf of the\r\nGeneral, refused to receive the letter addressed to \"Mr. Washington.\"\r\nThen Lord Howe sent an officer to the American camp with a second\r\nletter, addressed to \"George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.\" The bearer\r\nwas courteously received, but the letter was declined. \"The etc., etc.\r\nimplies everything,\" said the Englishman. It may also mean \"anything,\"\r\nWashington replied, and added that touching the pardoning power of\r\nLord Howe there could be no pardon where there was no guilt, and where\r\nno forgiveness was asked. As a result of these interviews, Lord Howe\r\nwrote to England that it would be well to give Mr. Washington his\r\nproper title. A small question, apparently, this of the form of\r\naddress, especially to a lover of facts, and yet it was in reality\r\nof genuine importance. To the world Washington represented the young\r\nrepublic, and he was determined to extort from England the first\r\nacknowledgment of independence by compelling her to recognize the\r\nAmericans as belligerents and not rebels. Washington cared as little\r\nfor vain shows as any man who ever lived, but he had the highest sense\r\nof personal dignity, and of the dignity of his cause and country.\r\nNeither should be allowed to suffer in his hands. He appreciated the\r\neffect on mankind of forms and titles, and with unerring judgment\r\nhe insisted on what he knew to be of real value. It is one of the\r\nearliest examples of the dignity and good taste which were of such\r\ninestimable value to his country.\r\n\r\nHe had abundant occasion also for the employment of these same\r\nqualities, coupled with unwearied patience and tact, in dealing with\r\nhis own men. The present army was drawn from a wider range than that\r\nwhich had taken Boston, and sectional jealousies and disputes, growing\r\nevery day more hateful to the commander-in-chief, sprang up rankly.\r\nThe men of Maryland thought those of Connecticut ploughboys; the\r\nlatter held the former to be fops and dandies. These and a hundred\r\nother disputes buzzed and whirled about Washington, stirring his\r\nstrong temper, and exercising his sternest self-control in the\r\nuntiring effort to suppress them and put them to death. \"It\r\nrequires,\" John Adams truly said, \"more serenity of temper, a deeper\r\nunderstanding, and more courage than fell to the lot of Marlborough,\r\nto ride in this whirlwind.\" Fortunately these qualities were all\r\nthere, and with them an honesty of purpose and an unbending directness\r\nof character to which Anne's great general was a stranger.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while the internal difficulties were slowly diminished, the\r\nforces of the enemy rapidly increased. First it became evident that\r\nattacks were not feasible. Then the question changed to a mere choice\r\nof defenses. Even as to this there was great and harassing doubt, for\r\nthe enemy, having command of the water, could concentrate and attack\r\nat any point they pleased. Moreover, the British had thirty thousand\r\nof the best disciplined and best equipped troops that Europe could\r\nfurnish, while Washington had some twenty thousand men, one fourth of\r\nwhom were unfit for duty, and with the remaining three fourths, raw\r\nrecruits for the most part, he was obliged to defend an extended line\r\nof posts, without cavalry, and with no means for rapid concentration.\r\nHad he been governed solely by military considerations he would have\r\nremoved the inhabitants, burned New York, and drawing his forces\r\ntogether would have taken up a secure post of observation. To have\r\ndestroyed the town, however, not only would have frightened the timid\r\nand the doubters, and driven them over to the Tories, but would have\r\ndispirited the patriots not yet alive to the exigencies of war, and\r\ndeeply injured the American cause. That Washington well understood the\r\nneed of such action is clear, both from the current rumors that the\r\ntown was to be burned, and from his expressed desire to remove the\r\nwomen and children from New York. But political considerations\r\noverruled the military necessity, and he spared the town. It was bad\r\nenough to be thus hampered, but he was even more fettered in other\r\nways, for he could not even concentrate his forces and withdraw to the\r\nHighlands without a battle, as he was obliged to fight in order to\r\nsustain public feeling, and thus he was driven on to almost sure\r\ndefeat. With Brooklyn Heights in the hands of the enemy New York was\r\nuntenable, and yet it was obvious that to hold Brooklyn when the enemy\r\ncontrolled the sea was inviting defeat. Yet Washington under the\r\nexisting conditions had no choice except to fight on Long Island and\r\nto say that he hoped to make a good defense.\r\n\r\nEverything, too, as the day of battle drew near, seemed to make\r\nagainst him. On August 22 the enemy began to land on Long Island,\r\nwhere Greene had drawn a strong line of redoubts behind the village of\r\nBrooklyn, to defend the heights which commanded New York, and had made\r\nevery arrangement to protect the three roads through the wooded hills,\r\nabout a mile from the intrenchments. Most unfortunately, and just at\r\nthe critical moment, Greene was taken down with a raging fever, so\r\nthat when Washington came over on the 24th he found much confusion in\r\nthe camps, which he repressed as best he could, and then prepared for\r\nthe attack. Greene's illness, however, had caused some oversights\r\nwhich were unknown to the commander-in-chief, and which, as it turned\r\nout, proved fatal.\r\n\r\nAfter indecisive skirmishing for two or three days, the British\r\nstarted early on the morning of the 26th. They had nine thousand men\r\nand were well informed as to the country. Advancing through woodpaths\r\nand lanes, they came round to the left flank of the Americans. One\r\nof the roads through the hills was unguarded, the others feebly\r\nprotected. The result is soon told. The Americans, out-generaled and\r\nout-flanked, were taken by surprise and surrounded, Sullivan and\r\nhis division were cut off, and then Lord Stirling. There was some\r\ndesperate fighting, and the Americans showed plenty of courage, but\r\nonly a few forced their way out. Most of them were killed or taken\r\nprisoners, the total loss out of some five thousand men reaching as\r\nhigh as two thousand.\r\n\r\nFrom the redoubts, whither he had come at the sound of the firing,\r\nWashington watched the slaughter and disaster in grim silence. He saw\r\nthe British troops, flushed with victory, press on to the very edge\r\nof his works and then withdraw in obedience to command. The British\r\ngenerals had their prey so surely, as they believed, that they\r\nmercifully decided not to waste life unnecessarily by storming the\r\nworks in the first glow of success. So they waited during that\r\nnight and the two following days, while Washington strengthened his\r\nintrenchments, brought over reinforcements, and prepared for the\r\nworst. On the 29th it became apparent that there was a movement in the\r\nfleet, and that arrangements were being made to take the Americans in\r\nthe rear and wholly cut them off. It was an obvious and sensible plan,\r\nbut the British overlooked the fact that while they were lingering,\r\nsumming up their victory, and counting the future as assured, there\r\nwas a silent watchful man on the other side of the redoubts who for\r\nforty-eight hours never left the lines, and who with a great capacity\r\nfor stubborn fighting could move, when the stress came, with the\r\ncelerity and stealth of a panther.\r\n\r\nWashington swiftly determined to retreat. It was a desperate\r\nundertaking, and a lesser man would have hesitated and been lost. He\r\nhad to transport nine thousand men across a strait of strong tides and\r\ncurrents, and three quarters of a mile in width. It was necessary to\r\ncollect the boats from a distance, and do it all within sight and\r\nhearing of the enemy. The boats were obtained, a thick mist settled\r\ndown on sea and land, the water was calm, and as the night wore away,\r\nthe entire army with all its arms and baggage was carried over,\r\nWashington leaving in the last boat. At daybreak the British awoke,\r\nbut it was too late. They had fought a successful battle, they had had\r\nthe American army in their grasp, and now all was over. The victory\r\nhad melted away, and, as a grand result, they had a few hundred\r\nprisoners, a stray boat with three camp-followers, and the deserted\r\nworks in which they stood. To grasp so surely the happy chance of wind\r\nand weather and make such a retreat as this was a feat of arms as\r\ngreat as most victories, and in it we see, perhaps as plainly as\r\nanywhere, the nerve and quickness of the man who conducted it. It is\r\ntrue, it was the only chance of salvation, but the great man is he who\r\nis entirely master of his opportunity, even if he have but one.\r\n\r\nThe outlook, nevertheless, was, as Washington wrote, \"truly\r\ndistressing.\" The troops were dispirited, and the militia began to\r\ndisappear, as they always did after a defeat. Congress would not\r\npermit the destruction of the city, different interests pulled in\r\ndifferent directions, conflicting opinions distracted the councils\r\nof war, and, with utter inability to predict the enemy's movements,\r\neverything led to halfway measures and to intense anxiety, while Lord\r\nHowe tried to negotiate with Congress, and the Americans waited for\r\nevents. Washington, looking beyond the confusion of the moment, saw\r\nthat he had gained much by delay, and had his own plan well defined.\r\nHe wrote: \"We have not only delayed the operations of the campaign\r\ntill it is too late to effect any capital incursion into the country,\r\nbut have drawn the enemy's forces to one point.... It would be\r\npresumption to draw out our young troops into open ground against\r\ntheir superiors both in number and discipline, and I have never spared\r\nthe spade and pickaxe.\" Every one else, however, saw only past defeat\r\nand present peril.\r\n\r\nThe British ships gradually made their way up the river, until it\r\nbecame apparent that they intended to surround and cut off the\r\nAmerican army. Washington made preparations to withdraw, but\r\nuncertainty of information came near rendering his precautions futile.\r\nSeptember 15 the men-of-war opened fire, and troops were landed near\r\nKip's Bay. The militia in the breastworks at that point had been\r\nat Brooklyn and gave way at once, communicating their panic to two\r\nConnecticut regiments. Washington, galloping down to the scene of\r\nbattle, came upon the disordered and flying troops. He dashed in among\r\nthem, conjuring them to stop, but even while he was trying to rally\r\nthem they broke again on the appearance of some sixty or seventy of\r\nthe enemy, and ran in all directions. In a tempest of anger Washington\r\ndrew his pistols, struck the fugitives with his sword, and was only\r\nforced from the field by one of his officers seizing the bridle of his\r\nhorse and dragging him away from the British, now within a hundred\r\nyards of the spot.\r\n\r\nThrough all his trials and anxieties Washington always showed the\r\nbroadest and most generous sympathy. When the militia had begun to\r\nleave him a few days before, although he despised their action and\r\nprotested bitterly to Congress against their employment, yet in his\r\nletters he displayed a keen appreciation of their feelings, and saw\r\nplainly every palliation and excuse. But there was one thing which\r\nhe could never appreciate nor realize. It was from first to last\r\nimpossible for him to understand how any man could refuse to fight, or\r\ncould think of running away. When he beheld rout and cowardly panic\r\nbefore his very eyes, his temper broke loose and ran uncontrolled. His\r\none thought then was to fight to the last, and he would have thrown\r\nhimself single-handed on the enemy, with all his wisdom and prudence\r\nflung to the winds. The day when the commander held his place merely\r\nby virtue of personal prowess lay far back in the centuries, and no\r\none knew it better than Washington. But the old fighting spirit awoke\r\nwithin him when the clash of arms sounded in his ears, and though we\r\nmay know the general in the tent and in the council, we can only know\r\nthe man when he breaks out from all rules and customs, and shows the\r\nrage of battle, and the indomitable eagerness for the fray, which lie\r\nat the bottom of the tenacity and courage that carried the war for\r\nindependence to a triumphant close.\r\n\r\nThe rout and panic over, Washington quickly turned to deal with the\r\npressing danger. With coolness and quickness he issued his orders, and\r\nsucceeded in getting his army off, Putnam's division escaping most\r\nnarrowly. He then took post at King's Bridge, and began to strengthen\r\nand fortify his lines. While thus engaged, the enemy advanced, and\r\non the 16th Washington suddenly took the offensive and attacked the\r\nBritish light troops. The result was a sharp skirmish, in which the\r\nBritish were driven back with serious loss, and great bravery was\r\nshown by the Connecticut and Virginia troops, the two commanding\r\nofficers being killed. This affair, which was the first gleam of\r\nsuccess, encouraged the troops, and was turned to the best account by\r\nthe general. Still a successful skirmish did not touch the essential\r\ndifficulties of the situation, which then as always came from\r\nwithin, rather than without. To face and check twenty-five thousand\r\nwell-equipped and highly disciplined soldiers Washington had now some\r\ntwelve thousand men, lacking in everything which goes to make an army,\r\nexcept mere individual courage and a high average of intelligence.\r\nEven this meagre force was an inconstant and diminishing quantity,\r\nshifting, uncertain, and always threatening dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe task of facing and fighting the enemy was enough for the ablest\r\nof men; but Washington was obliged also to combat and overcome the\r\ninertness and dullness born of ignorance, and to teach Congress how to\r\ngovern a nation at war. In the hours \"allotted to sleep,\" he sat in\r\nhis headquarters, writing a letter, with \"blots and scratches,\" which\r\ntold Congress with the utmost precision and vigor just what was\r\nneeded. It was but one of a long series of similar letters, written\r\nwith unconquerable patience and with unwearied iteration, lighted here\r\nand there by flashes of deep and angry feeling, which would finally\r\nstrike home under the pressure of defeat, and bring the patriots of\r\nthe legislature to sudden action, always incomplete, but still action\r\nof some sort. It must have been inexpressibly dreary work, but quite\r\nas much was due to those letters as to the battles. Thinking for other\r\npeople, and teaching them what to do, is at best an ungrateful duty,\r\nbut when it is done while an enemy is at your throat, it shows a grim\r\ntenacity of purpose which is well worth consideration.\r\n\r\nIn this instance the letter of September 24, read in the light of the\r\nbattles of Long Island and Kip's Bay, had a considerable effect. The\r\nfirst steps were taken to make the army national and permanent, to\r\nraise the pay of officers, and to lengthen enlistments. Like most of\r\nthe war measures of Congress, they were too late for the immediate\r\nnecessity, but they helped the future. Congress, moreover, then felt\r\nthat all had been done that could be demanded, and relapsed once more\r\ninto confidence. \"The British force,\" said John Adams, chairman of the\r\nboard of war, \"is so divided, they will do no great matter this\r\nfall.\" But Washington, facing hard facts, wrote to Congress with his\r\nunsparing truth on October 4: \"Give me leave to say, sir, (I say it\r\nwith due deference and respect, and my knowledge of the facts, added\r\nto the importance of the cause and the stake I hold in it, must\r\njustify the freedom,) that your affairs are in a more unpromising way\r\nthan you seem to apprehend. Your army, as I mentioned in my last, is\r\non the eve of its political dissolution. True it is, you have voted\r\na larger one in lieu of it; but the season is late; and there is a\r\nmaterial difference between voting battalions and raising men.\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign as seen from the board of war and from the Plains of\r\nHarlem differed widely. It is needless to say now which was correct;\r\nevery one knows that the General was right and Congress wrong, but\r\nbeing in the right did not help Washington, nor did he take petty\r\npleasure in being able to say, \"I told you how it would be.\" The\r\nhard facts remained unchanged. There was the wholly patriotic but\r\nslumberous, and for fighting purposes quite inefficient Congress still\r\nto be waked up and kept awake, and to be instructed. With painful\r\nand plain-spoken repetition this work was grappled with and done\r\nmethodically, and like all else as effectively as was possible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the days slipped along, and Washington waited on the Harlem\r\nPlains, planning descents on Long Island, and determining to make a\r\ndesperate stand where he was, unless the situation decidedly changed.\r\nThen the situation did change, as neither he nor any one else\r\napparently had anticipated. The British warships came up the Hudson\r\npast the forts, brushing aside our boasted obstructions, destroying\r\nour little fleet, and getting command of the river. Then General Howe\r\nlanded at Frog's Point, where he was checked for the moment by the\r\ngood disposition of Heath, under Washington's direction. These two\r\nevents made it evident that the situation of the American army was\r\nfull of peril, and that retreat was again necessary. Such certainly\r\nwas the conclusion of the council of war, on the 16th, acting this\r\ntime in agreement with their chief. Six days Howe lingered on Frog's\r\nPoint, bringing up stores or artillery or something; it matters little\r\nnow why he tarried. Suffice it that he waited, and gave six days to\r\nhis opponent. They were of little value to Howe, but they were\r\nof inestimable worth to Washington, who employed them in getting\r\neverything in readiness, in holding his council of war, and then on\r\nthe 17th in moving deliberately off to very strong ground at White\r\nPlains. On his way he fought two or three slight, sharp, and\r\nsuccessful skirmishes with the British. Sir William followed closely,\r\nbut with much caution, having now a dull glimmer in his mind that at\r\nthe head of the raw troops in front of him was a man with whom it was\r\nnot safe to be entirely careless.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, Howe came up to Washington's position, and found the\r\nAmericans quite equal in numbers, strongly intrenched, and awaiting\r\nhis attack with confidence. He hesitated, doubted, and finally feeling\r\nthat he must do something, sent four thousand men to storm Chatterton\r\nHill, an outlying post, where some fourteen hundred Americans were\r\nstationed. There was a short, sharp action, and then the Americans\r\nretreated in good order to the main army, having lost less than half\r\nas many men as their opponents. With caution now much enlarged, Howe\r\nsent for reinforcements, and waited two days. The third day it rained,\r\nand on the fourth Howe found that Washington had withdrawn to a higher\r\nand quite impregnable line of hills, where he held all the passes in\r\nthe rear and awaited a second attack. Howe contemplated the situation\r\nfor two or three days longer, and then broke camp and withdrew to\r\nDobbs Ferry to secure Fort Washington, which treachery offered him as\r\nan easy and inviting prize. Such were the great results of the victory\r\nof Long Island, two wasted months, and the American army still\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nHowe was resolved that his campaign should not be utterly fruitless,\r\nand therefore directed his attention to the defenses of the Hudson,\r\nand here he met with better success. Congress, in its military wisdom,\r\nhad insisted that these forts must and could be held. So thought the\r\ngenerals, and so most especially, and most unluckily, did Greene.\r\nWashington, with his usual accurate and keen perception, saw, from the\r\ntime the men-of-war came up the Hudson, and, now that the British\r\narmy was free, more clearly than ever, that both forts ought to be\r\nabandoned. Sure of his ground, he overruled Congress, but was so far\r\ninfluenced by Greene that he gave to that officer discretionary orders\r\nas to withdrawal. This was an act of weakness, as he afterwards\r\nadmitted, for which he bitterly reproached himself, never confusing or\r\nglossing over his own errors, but loyal there, as elsewhere, to facts.\r\nAn attempt was made to hold both forts, and both were lost, as he\r\nhad foreseen. From Fort Lee the garrison withdrew in safety. Fort\r\nWashington, with its plans all in Howe's hands through the treachery\r\nof William Demont, the adjutant of Colonel Magaw, was carried by\r\nstorm, after a severe struggle. Twenty-six hundred men and all the\r\nmunitions of war fell into the hands of the enemy. It was a serious\r\nand most depressing loss, and was felt throughout the continent.\r\n\r\nMeantime Washington had crossed info the Jerseys, and, after the loss\r\nof Fort Lee, began to retreat before the British, who, flushed with\r\nvictory, now advanced rapidly under Lord Cornwallis. The crisis of his\r\nfate and of the Revolution was upon him. His army was melting away.\r\nThe militia had almost all disappeared, and regiments whose term of\r\nenlistment had expired were departing daily. Lee, who had a division\r\nunder his command, was ordered to come up, but paid no attention,\r\nalthough the orders were repeated almost every day for a month. He\r\nlingered, and loitered, and excused himself, and at last was taken\r\nprisoner. This disposed of him for a time very satisfactorily, but\r\nmeanwhile he had succeeded in keeping his troops from Washington,\r\nwhich was a most serious misfortune.\r\n\r\nOn December 2 Washington was at Princeton with three thousand ragged\r\nmen, and the British close upon his heels. They had him now surely\r\nin their grip. There could be no mistake this time, and there was\r\ntherefore no need of a forced march. But they had not yet learned that\r\nto Washington even hours meant much, and when, after duly resting,\r\nthey reached the Delaware, they found the Americans on the other side,\r\nand all the boats destroyed for a distance of seventy miles.\r\n\r\nIt was winter now, the short gray days had come, and with them\r\npiercing cold and storms of sleet and ice. It seemed as if the\r\nelements alone would finally disperse the feeble body of men still\r\ngathered about the commander-in-chief. Congress had sent him blank\r\ncommissions and orders to recruit, which were well meant, but were not\r\npractically of much value. As Glendower could call spirits from the\r\nvasty deep, so they, with like success, sought to call soldiers from\r\nthe earth in the midst of defeat, and in the teeth of a North American\r\nwinter. Washington, baffling pursuit and flying from town to town,\r\nleft nothing undone. North and south went letters and appeals for men,\r\nmoney, and supplies. Vain, very vain, it all was, for the most part,\r\nbut still it was done in a tenacious spirit. Lee would not come, the\r\nJersey militia would not turn out, thousands began to accept Howe's\r\namnesty, and signs of wavering were apparent in some of the Middle\r\nStates. Philadelphia was threatened, Newport was in the hands of the\r\nenemy, and for ninety miles Washington had retreated, evading ruin\r\nagain and again only by the width of a river. Congress voted not\r\nto leave Philadelphia,--a fact which their General declined to\r\npublish,--and then fled.\r\n\r\nNo one remained to face the grim realities of the time but Washington,\r\nand he met them unmoved. Not a moment passed that he did not seek in\r\nsome way to effect something. Not an hour went by that he did not turn\r\ncalmly from fresh and ever renewed disappointment to work and action.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of December Howe felt satisfied that the American army\r\nwould soon dissolve, and leaving strong detachments in various posts\r\nhe withdrew to New York. His premises were sound, and his conclusions\r\nlogical, but he made his usual mistake of overlooking and\r\nunderestimating the American general. No sooner was it known that\r\nhe was on his way to New York than Washington, at the head of his\r\ndissolving army, resolved to take the offensive and strike an outlying\r\npost. In a letter of December 14, the day after Howe began to move, we\r\ncatch the first glimpse of Trenton. It was a bold spirit which, in the\r\ndead of winter, with a broken army, no prospect of reinforcements, and\r\nin the midst of a terror-stricken people, could thus resolve with\r\nsome four thousand men to attack an army thoroughly appointed, and\r\nnumbering in all its divisions twenty-five thousand soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is well to pause a moment and look at that situation, and at the\r\noverwhelming difficulties which hemmed it in, and then try to realize\r\nwhat manner of man he was who rose superior to it, and conquered it.\r\nBe it remembered, too, that he never deceived himself, and never for\r\none instant disguised the truth. Two years later he wrote that at this\r\nsupreme moment, in what were called \"the dark days of America,\" he was\r\nnever despondent; and this was true enough, for despair was not in his\r\nnature. But no delusions lent him courage. On the 18th he wrote to his\r\nbrother \"that if every nerve was not strained to recruit this new army\r\nthe game was pretty nearly up;\" and added, \"You can form no idea of\r\nthe perplexity of my situation. No man, I believe, ever had a greater\r\nchoice of difficulties, and less means to extricate himself from them.\r\nHowever, under a full persuasion of the justice of our cause, I cannot\r\nentertain an idea that it will finally sink, though it may remain\r\nfor some time under a cloud.\" There is no complaint, no boasting, no\r\ndespair in this letter. We can detect a bitterness in the references\r\nto Congress and to Lee, but the tone of the letter is as calm as a May\r\nmorning, and it concludes with sending love and good wishes to the\r\nwriter's sister and her family.\r\n\r\nThus in the dreary winter Washington was planning and devising and\r\nsending hither and thither for men, and never ceased through it all\r\nto write urgent and ever sharper letters and keep a wary eye upon the\r\nfuture. He not only wrote strongly, but he pledged his own estate and\r\nexceeded his powers in desperate efforts to raise money and men. On\r\nthe 20th he wrote to Congress: \"It may be thought that I am going a\r\ngood deal out of the line of my duty to adopt these measures, or to\r\nadvise thus freely. A character to lose, an estate to forfeit, the\r\ninestimable blessings of liberty at stake, and a life devoted, must be\r\nmy excuse.\" Even now across the century these words come with a grave\r\nsolemnity to our ears, and we can feel as he felt when he alone saw\r\nthat he stood on the brink of a great crisis. It is an awful thing to\r\nknow that the life of a nation is at stake, and this thought throbs in\r\nhis words, measured and quiet as usual, but deeply fraught with much\r\nmeaning to him and to the world.\r\n\r\nBy Christmas all was ready, and when the Christian world was rejoicing\r\nand feasting, and the British officers in New York and in the New\r\nJersey towns were reveling and laughing, Washington prepared to\r\nstrike. His whole force, broken into various detachments, was less\r\nthan six thousand men. To each division was assigned, with provident\r\nforethought, its exact part. Nothing was overlooked, nothing omitted;\r\nand then every division commander failed, for good reason or bad, to\r\ndo his duty. Gates was to march from Bristol with two thousand\r\nmen, Ewing was to cross at Trenton, Putnam was to come up from\r\nPhiladelphia, Griffin was to make a diversion against Donop. When\r\nthe moment came, Gates, disapproving the scheme, was on his way\r\nto Congress, and Wilkinson, with his message, found his way to\r\nheadquarters by following the bloody tracks of the barefooted\r\nsoldiers. Griffin abandoned New Jersey and fled before Donop. Putnam\r\nwould not even attempt to leave Philadelphia, and Ewing made no effort\r\nto cross at Trenton. Cadwalader, indeed, came down from Bristol,\r\nbut after looking at the river and the floating ice, gave it up as\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nBut there was one man who did not hesitate nor give up, nor halt on\r\naccount of floating ice. With twenty-four hundred hardy veterans,\r\nWashington crossed the Delaware. The night was bitter cold and the\r\npassage difficult. When they landed, and began their march of nine\r\nmiles to Trenton, a fierce storm of sleet drove in their faces.\r\nSullivan; marching by the river, sent word that the arms of his men\r\nwere wet. \"Then tell your general,\" said Washington, \"to use the\r\nbayonet, for the town must be taken.\" In broad daylight they came to\r\nthe town. Washington, at the front and on the right of the line, swept\r\ndown the Pennington road, and as he drove in the pickets he heard the\r\nshouts of Sullivan's men, as, with Stark leading the van, they charged\r\nin from the river. A company of yägers and the light dragoons slipped\r\naway, there was a little confused fighting in the streets, Colonel\r\nRahl fell, mortally wounded, his Hessians threw down their arms, and\r\nall was over. The battle had been fought and won, and the Revolution\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE]\r\n\r\nTaking his thousand prisoners with him, Washington recrossed the\r\nDelaware to his old position. Had all done their duty, as he had\r\nplanned, the British hold on New Jersey would have been shattered. As\r\nit was, it was only loosened. Congress, aroused at last, had invested\r\nWashington with almost dictatorial powers; but the time for action was\r\nshort. The army was again melting away, and only by urgent appeals\r\nwere some veterans retained, and enough new men gathered to make a\r\nforce of five thousand men. With this army Washington prepared to\r\nfinish what he had begun.\r\n\r\nTrenton struck alarm and dismay into the British, and Cornwallis, with\r\nseven thousand of the best troops, started from New York to redeem\r\nwhat had been lost. Leaving three regiments at Princeton, he pushed\r\nhotly after Washington, who fell back behind the Assunpink River,\r\nskirmishing heavily and successfully. When Cornwallis reached the\r\nriver he found the American army drawn up on the other side awaiting\r\nhim. An attack on the bridge was repulsed, and the prospect looked\r\nuninviting. Some officers urged an immediate assault; but night was\r\nfalling, and Cornwallis, sure of the game, decided to wait till\r\nthe morrow. He, too, forgot that he was facing an enemy who never\r\noverlooked a mistake, and never waited an hour. With quick decision\r\nWashington left his camp-fires burning on the river bank, and taking\r\nroundabout roads, which he had already reconnoitred, marched on to\r\nPrinceton. By sunrise he was in the outskirts of the town. Mercer,\r\ndetached with some three hundred men, fell in with Mawhood's regiment,\r\nand a sharp action ensued. Mercer was mortally wounded, and his men\r\ngave way just as the main army came upon the field. The British\r\ncharged, and as the raw Pennsylvanian troops in the van wavered,\r\nWashington rode to the front, and reining his horse within thirty\r\nyards of the British, ordered his men to advance. The volleys of\r\nmusketry left him unscathed, the men stood firm, the other divisions\r\ncame rapidly into action, and the enemy gave way in all directions.\r\nThe two other British regiments were driven through the town and\r\nrouted. Had there been cavalry they would have been entirely cut off.\r\nAs it was, they were completely broken, and in this short but bloody\r\naction they lost five hundred men in killed, wounded, and prisoners.\r\nIt was too late to strike the magazines at Brunswick, as Washington\r\nhad intended, and so he withdrew once more with his army to the high\r\nlands to rest and recruit.\r\n\r\nHis work was done, however. The country, which had been supine, and\r\neven hostile, rose now, and the British were attacked, surprised, and\r\ncut off in all directions, until at last they were shut up in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of New York. The tide had been turned, and\r\nWashington had won the precious breathing-time which was all he\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great is reported to have said that this was the most\r\nbrilliant campaign of the century. It certainly showed all the\r\ncharacteristics of the highest strategy and most consummate\r\ngeneralship. With a force numerically insignificant as compared with\r\nthat opposed to him, Washington won two decisive victories, striking\r\nthe enemy suddenly with superior numbers at each point of attack.\r\nThe Trenton campaign has all the quality of some of the last battles\r\nfought by Napoleon in France before his retirement to Elba. Moreover,\r\nthese battles show not only generalship of the first order, but great\r\nstatesmanship. They display that prescient knowledge which recognizes\r\nthe supreme moment when all must be risked to save the state. By\r\nTrenton and Princeton Washington inflicted deadly blows upon the\r\nenemy, but he did far more by reviving the patriotic spirit of the\r\ncountry fainting under the bitter experience of defeat, and by sending\r\nfresh life and hope and courage throughout the whole people.\r\n\r\nIt was the decisive moment of the war. Sooner or later the American\r\ncolonies were sure to part from the mother-country, either peaceably\r\nor violently. But there was nothing inevitable in the Revolution of\r\n1776, nor was its end at all certain. It was in the last extremities\r\nwhen the British overran New Jersey, and if it had not been for\r\nWashington that particular revolution would have most surely failed.\r\nIts fate lay in the hands of the general and his army; and to the\r\nstrong brain growing ever keener and quicker as the pressure became\r\nmore intense, to the iron will gathering a more relentless force\r\nas defeat thickened, to the high, unbending character, and to the\r\npassionate and fighting temper of Washington, we owe the brilliant\r\ncampaign which in the darkest hour turned the tide and saved the cause\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\"MALICE DOMESTIC, AND FOREIGN LEVY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the \"two lucky strokes at Trenton and Princeton,\" as he himself\r\ncalled them, Washington took up a strong position at Morristown and\r\nwaited. His plan was to hold the enemy in check, and to delay all\r\noperations until spring. It is easy enough now to state his purpose,\r\nand it looks very simple, but it was a grim task to carry it out\r\nthrough the bleak winter days of 1777. The Jerseys farmers, spurred by\r\nthe sufferings inflicted upon them by the British troops, had turned\r\nout at last in deference to Washington's appeals, after the victories\r\nof Trenton and Princeton, had harassed and cut off outlying parties,\r\nand had thus straitened the movements of the enemy. But the main army\r\nof the colonies, on which all depended, was in a pitiable state. It\r\nshifted its character almost from day to day. The curse of short\r\nenlistments, so denounced by Washington, made itself felt now with\r\nfrightful effect. With the new year most of the continental troops\r\ndeparted, while others to replace them came in very slowly, and\r\nrecruiting dragged most wearisomely. Washington was thus obliged, with\r\ntemporary reinforcements of raw militia, to keep up appearances; and\r\nno commander ever struggled with a more trying task. At times it\r\nlooked as if the whole army would actually disappear, and more than\r\nonce Washington expected that the week's or the month's end would find\r\nhim with not more than five hundred men. At the beginning of March he\r\nhad about four thousand men, a few weeks later only three thousand raw\r\ntroops, ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-shod, ill-armed, and almost unpaid.\r\nOver against him was Howe, with eleven thousand men in the field, and\r\nstill more in the city of New York, well disciplined and equipped,\r\nwell-armed, well-fed, and furnished with every needful supply. The\r\ncontrast is absolutely grotesque, and yet the force of one man's\r\ngenius and will was such that this excellent British army was hemmed\r\nin and kept in harmless quiet by their ragged opponents.\r\n\r\nWashington's plan, from the first, was to keep the field at all\r\nhazards, and literally at all hazards did he do so. Right and left\r\nhis letters went, day after day, calling with pathetic but dignified\r\nearnestness for men and supplies. In one of these epistles, to\r\nGovernor Cooke of Rhode Island, written in January, to remonstrate\r\nagainst raising troops for the State only, he set forth his intentions\r\nin a few words. \"You must be sensible,\" he said, \"that the season is\r\nfast approaching when a new campaign will open; nay, the former is not\r\nyet closed; nor do I intend it shall be, unless the enemy quits the\r\nJerseys.\" To keep fighting all the time, and never let the fire of\r\nactive resistance flicker or die out, was Washington's theory of the\r\nway to maintain his own side and beat the enemy. If he could not fight\r\nbig battles, he would fight small ones; if he could not fight little\r\nbattles, he would raid and skirmish and surprise; but fighting of some\r\nsort he would have, while the enemy attempted to spread over a State\r\nand hold possession of it. We can see the obstacles now, but we can\r\nonly wonder how they were sufficiently overcome to allow anything to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nMoreover, besides the purely physical difficulties in the lack of men,\r\nmoney, and supplies, there were others of a political and personal\r\nkind, which were even more wearing and trying, but which,\r\nnevertheless, had to be dealt with also, in some fashion. In order to\r\nsustain the courage of the people Washington was obliged to give out,\r\nand to allow it to be supposed, that he had more men than was really\r\nthe case, and so Congress and various wise and well-meaning persons\r\ngrumbled because he did not do more and fight more battles. He never\r\ndeceived Congress, but they either could not or would not understand\r\nthe actual situation. In March he wrote to Robert Morris: \"Nor is it\r\nin my power to make Congress fully sensible of the real situation\r\nof our affairs, and that it is with difficulty, if I may use the\r\nexpression, that I can by every means in my power keep the life and\r\nsoul of this army together. In a word, when they are at a distance,\r\nthey think it is but to say, _Presto, begone_, and everything is done.\r\nThey seem not to have any conception of the difficulty and perplexity\r\nattending those who are to execute.\" It was so easy to see what they\r\nwould like to have done, and so simple to pass a resolve to that\r\neffect, that Congress never could appreciate the reality of the\r\ndifficulty and the danger until the hand of the enemy was almost at\r\ntheir throats. They were not even content with delay and neglect, but\r\ninterfered actively at times, as in the matter of the exchange of\r\nprisoners, where they made unending trouble for Washington, and showed\r\nthemselves unable to learn or to keep their hands off after any amount\r\nof instruction.\r\n\r\nIn January Washington issued a proclamation requiring those\r\ninhabitants who had subscribed to Howe's declaration to come in within\r\nthirty days and take the oath of allegiance to the United States. If\r\nthey failed to do so they were to be treated as enemies. The measure\r\nwas an eminently proper one, and the proclamation was couched in the\r\nmost moderate language. It was impossible to permit a large class\r\nof persons to exist on the theory that they were peaceful American\r\ncitizens and also subjects of King George. The results of such conduct\r\nwere in every way perilous and intolerable, and Washington was\r\ndetermined that he would divide the sheep from the goats, and know\r\nwhom he was defending and whom attacking. Yet for this wise and\r\nnecessary action he was called in question in Congress and accused of\r\nviolating civil rights and the resolves of Congress itself. Nothing\r\nwas actually done about it, but such an incident shows from a single\r\npoint the infinite tact and resolution required in waging war under a\r\ngovernment whose members were unable to comprehend what was meant, and\r\nwho could not see that until they had beaten England it was hardly\r\nworth while to worry about civil rights, which in case of defeat would\r\nspeedily cease to exist altogether.\r\n\r\nAnother fertile source of trouble arose from questions of rank.\r\nMembers of Congress, in making promotions and appointments, were\r\nmore apt to consider local claims than military merit, and they also\r\nallowed their own personal prejudices to affect their action in\r\nthis respect far too much. Thence arose endless heart-burnings\r\nand jealousies, followed by resignations and the loss of valuable\r\nofficers. Congress, having made the appointments, would go cheerfully\r\nabout its business, while the swarm of grievances thus let loose would\r\ncome buzzing about the devoted head of the commander-in-chief. He\r\ncould not adjourn, but was compelled to quiet rivalries, allay\r\nirritated feelings, and ride the storm as best he might. It was all\r\ndone, however, in one way or another: by personal appeals, and by\r\nletters full of dignity, patriotism, and patience, which are very\r\nimpressive and full of meaning for students of character, even in this\r\nday and generation.\r\n\r\nThen again, not content with snarling up our native appointments,\r\nCongress complicated matters still more dangerously by its treatment\r\nof foreigners. The members of Congress were colonists, and the fact\r\nthat they had shaken off the yoke of the mother country did not in the\r\nleast alter their colonial and perfectly natural habit of regarding\r\nwith enormous respect Englishmen and Frenchmen, and indeed anybody who\r\nhad had the good fortune to be born in Europe. The result was that\r\nthey distributed commissions and gave inordinate rank to the many\r\nvolunteers who came over the ocean, actuated by various motives, but\r\nall filled with a profound sense of their own merits. It is only fair\r\nto Congress to say that the American agents abroad were even more to\r\nblame in this respect. Silas Deane especially scattered promises of\r\ncommissions with a lavish hand, and Congress refused to fulfill many\r\nof the promises thus made in its name. Nevertheless, Congress was far\r\ntoo lax, and followed too closely the example of its agents. Some of\r\nthese foreigners were disinterested men and excellent soldiers, who\r\nproved of great value to the American cause. Many others were mere\r\nmilitary adventurers, capable of being turned to good account,\r\nperhaps, but by no means entitled to what they claimed and in most\r\ninstances received.\r\n\r\nThe ill-considered action of Congress and of our agents abroad in\r\nthis respect was a source of constantly recurring troubles of a very\r\nserious nature. Native officers, who had borne the burden and heat of\r\nthe day, justly resented being superseded by some stranger, unable\r\nto speak the language, who had landed in the States but a few days\r\nbefore. As a result, resignations were threatened which, if carried\r\nout, would affect the character of the army very deeply. Then again,\r\nthe foreigners themselves, inflated by the eagerness of our agents and\r\nby their reception at the hands of Congress, would find on joining the\r\narmy that they could get no commands, chiefly because there were none\r\nto give. They would then become dissatisfied with their rank and\r\nemployment, and bitter complaints and recriminations would ensue.\r\nAll these difficulties, of course, fell most heavily upon the\r\ncommander-in-chief, who was heartily disgusted with the whole\r\nbusiness. Washington believed from the beginning, and said over and\r\nover again in various and ever stronger terms, that this was an\r\nAmerican war and must be fought by Americans. In no other way, and\r\nby no other persons, did he consider that it could be carried to any\r\nsuccess worth having. He saw of course the importance of a French\r\nalliance, and deeply desired it, for it was a leading element in the\r\nsolution of the political and military situation; but alliance with\r\na foreign power was one thing, and sporadic military volunteers were\r\nanother. Washington had no narrow prejudices against foreigners,\r\nfor he was a man of broad and liberal mind, and no one was more\r\nuniversally beloved and respected by the foreign officers than he; but\r\nhe was intensely American in his feelings, and he would not admit for\r\nan instant that the American war for independence could be righteously\r\nfought or honestly won by others than Americans. He was well aware\r\nthat foreign volunteers had a value and use of which he largely and\r\ngratefully availed himself; but he was exasperated and alarmed by the\r\nindiscriminate and lavish way in which Congress and our agents abroad\r\ngave rank and office to them. \"Hungry adventurers,\" he called them in\r\none letter, when driven beyond endurance by the endless annoyances\r\nthus forced upon him; and so he pushed their pretensions aside,\r\nand managed, on the whole, to keep them in their proper place. The\r\noperation was delicate, difficult, and unpleasant, for it seemed to\r\nsavor of ingratitude. But Washington was never shaken for an instant\r\nin his policy, and while he checked the danger, he showed in many\r\ninstances, like Lafayette and Steuben, that he could appreciate and\r\nuse all that was really valuable in the foreign contingent.\r\n\r\nThe service rendered by Washington in this matter has never been\r\njustly understood or appreciated. If he had not taken this position,\r\nand held it with an absolute firmness which bordered on harshness, we\r\nshould have found ourselves in a short time with an army of American\r\nsoldiers officered by foreigners, many of them mere mercenaries,\r\n\"hungry adventurers,\" from France, Poland or Hungary, from Germany,\r\nIreland or England. The result of such a combination would have been\r\ndisorganization and defeat. That members of Congress and some of our\r\nrepresentatives in Europe did not see the danger, and that they were\r\nimpressed by the foreign officers who came among them, was perfectly\r\nnatural. Men are the creatures of the time in which they live, and\r\ntake their color from the conditions which surround them, as the\r\nchameleon does from the grass or leaves in which it hides. The rulers\r\nand lawmakers of 1776 could not cast off their provincial awe of\r\nthe natives of England and Europe as they cast off their political\r\nallegiance to the British king. The only wonder is that there should\r\nhave been even one man so great in mind and character that he could\r\nrise at a single bound from the level of a provincial planter to the\r\nheights of a great national leader. He proved himself such in all\r\nways, but in none more surely than in his ability to consider all men\r\nsimply as men, and, with a judgment that nothing could confuse, to\r\nward off from his cause and country the dangers inherent in colonial\r\nhabits of thought and action, so menacing to a people struggling for\r\nindependence. We can see this strong, high spirit of nationality\r\nrunning through Washington's whole career, but it never did better\r\nservice than when it stood between the American army and undue favor\r\nto foreign volunteers.\r\n\r\nAmong other disagreeable and necessary truths, Washington had told\r\nCongress that Philadelphia was in danger, that Howe probably meant to\r\noccupy it, and that it would be nearly impossible to prevent his doing\r\nso. This warning being given and unheeded, he continued to watch his\r\nantagonist, doing so with increased vigilance, as signs of activity\r\nbegan to appear in New York. Toward the end of May he broke up his\r\ncantonments, having now about seven thousand men, and took a strong\r\nposition within ten miles of Brunswick. Here he waited, keeping\r\nan anxious eye on the Hudson in case he should be mistaken in his\r\nexpectations, and should find that the enemy really intended to go\r\nnorth to meet Burgoyne instead of south to capture Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWashington's doubts were soon to be resolved and his expectations\r\nfulfilled. May 31, a fleet of a hundred sail left New York, and\r\ncouriers were at once sent southward to warn the States of the\r\npossibility of a speedy invasion. About the same time transports\r\narrived with more German mercenaries, and Howe, thus reinforced,\r\nentered the Jerseys. Washington determined to decline battle, and if\r\nthe enemy pushed on and crossed the Delaware, to hang heavily on their\r\nrear, while the militia from the south were drawn up to Philadelphia.\r\nHe adopted this course because he felt confident that Howe would never\r\ncross the Delaware and leave the main army of the Americans behind\r\nhim. His theory proved correct. The British advanced and retreated,\r\nburned houses and villages and made feints, but all in vain.\r\nWashington baffled them at every point, and finally Sir William\r\nevacuated the Jerseys entirely and withdrew to New York and Staten\r\nIsland, where active preparations for some expedition were at once\r\nbegun. Again came anxious watching, with the old fear that Howe meant\r\nto go northward and join the now advancing Burgoyne. The fear was\r\ngroundless. On July 23 the British fleet set sail from New York,\r\ncarrying between fifteen and eighteen thousand men. Not deceived by\r\nthe efforts to make him think that they aimed at Boston, but still\r\nfearing that the sailing might be only a ruse and the Hudson the real\r\nobject after all, Washington moved cautiously to the Delaware, holding\r\nhimself ready to strike in either direction. On the 31st he heard that\r\nthe enemy were at the Capes. This seemed decisive; so he sent in\r\nall directions for reinforcements, moved the main army rapidly to\r\nGermantown, and prepared to defend Philadelphia. The next news was\r\nthat the fleet had put to sea again, and again messengers went north\r\nto warn Putnam to prepare for the defense of the Hudson. Washington\r\nhimself was about to re-cross the Delaware, when tidings arrived that\r\nthe fleet had once more appeared at the Capes, and after a few more\r\ndays of doubt the ships came up the Chesapeake and anchored.\r\n\r\nWashington thought the \"route a strange one,\" but he knew now that he\r\nwas right in his belief that Howe aimed at Philadelphia. He therefore\r\ngathered his forces and marched south to meet the enemy, passing\r\nthrough the city in order to impress the disaffected and the timid\r\nwith the show of force. It was a motley array that followed him. There\r\nwas nothing uniform about the troops except their burnished arms and\r\nthe sprigs of evergreen in their hats. Nevertheless Lafayette, who had\r\njust come among them, thought that they looked like good soldiers, and\r\nthe Tories woke up sharply to the fact that there was a large body of\r\nmen known as the American army, and that they had a certain obvious\r\nfighting capacity visible in their appearance. Neither friends nor\r\nenemies knew, however, as they stood on the Philadelphia sidewalks\r\nand watched the troops go past, that the mere fact of that army's\r\nexistence was the greatest victory of skill and endurance which\r\nthe war could show, and that the question of success lay in its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nLeaving Philadelphia, Washington pushed on to the junction of the\r\nBrandywine and Christiana Creek, and posted his men along the heights.\r\nAugust 25, Howe landed at the Head of Elk, and Washington threw out\r\nlight parties to drive in cattle, carry off supplies, and annoy the\r\nenemy. This was done, on the whole, satisfactorily, and after some\r\nsuccessful skirmishing on the part of the Americans, the two armies\r\non the 5th of September found themselves within eight or ten miles of\r\neach other. Washington now determined to risk a battle in the field,\r\ndespite his inferiority in every way. He accordingly issued a\r\nstirring proclamation to the soldiers, and then fell back behind the\r\nBrandywine, to a strong position, and prepared to contest the passage\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nEarly on September 11, the British advanced to Chad's Ford, where\r\nWashington was posted with the main body, and after some skirmishing\r\nbegan to cannonade at long range. Meantime Cornwallis, with the main\r\nbody, made a long détour of seventeen miles, and came upon the right\r\nflank and rear of the Americans. Sullivan, who was on the right, had\r\nfailed to guard the fords above, and through lack of information was\r\npractically surprised. Washington, on rumors that the enemy were\r\nmarching toward his right, with the instinct of a great soldier was\r\nabout to cross the river in his front and crush the enemy there, but\r\nhe also was misled and kept back by false reports. When the truth was\r\nknown, it was too late. The right wing had been beaten and flung back,\r\nthe enemy were nearly in the rear, and were now advancing in earnest\r\nin front. All that man could do was done. Troops were pushed forward\r\nand a gallant stand was made at various points; but the critical\r\nmoment had come and gone, and there was nothing for it but a hasty\r\nretreat, which came near degenerating into a rout.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this complete defeat, for such it was, are easily seen.\r\nWashington had planned his battle and chosen his position well. If he\r\nhad not been deceived by the first reports, he even then would have\r\nfallen upon and overwhelmed the British centre before they could\r\nhave reached his right wing. But the Americans, to begin with, were\r\noutnumbered. They had only eleven thousand effective men, while the\r\nBritish brought fifteen of their eighteen thousand into action. Then\r\nthe Americans suffered, as they constantly did, from misinformation,\r\nand from an absence of system in learning the enemy's movements.\r\nWashington's attack was fatally checked in this way, and Sullivan\r\nwas surprised from the same causes, as well as from his own culpable\r\nignorance of the country beyond him, which was the reason of his\r\nfailure to guard the upper fords. The Americans lost, also, by the\r\nunsteadiness of new troops when the unexpected happens, and when\r\nthe panic-bearing notion that they are surprised and likely to be\r\nsurrounded comes upon them with a sudden shock.\r\n\r\nThis defeat was complete and severe, and it was followed in a few days\r\nby that of Wayne, who narrowly escaped utter ruin. Yet through all\r\nthis disaster we can see the advance which had been made since the\r\nequally unfortunate and very similar battle on Long Island. Then, the\r\ntroops seemed to lose heart and courage, the army was held together\r\nwith difficulty, and could do nothing but retreat. Now, in the few\r\ndays which Howe, as usual, gave his opponent with such fatal effect to\r\nhimself, Washington rallied his army, and finding them in excellent\r\nspirits marched down the Lancaster road to fight again. On the eve of\r\nbattle a heavy storm came on, which so injured the arms and munitions\r\nthat with bitter disappointment he was obliged to withdraw; but\r\nnevertheless it is plain how much this forward movement meant. At the\r\nmoment, however, it looked badly enough, especially after the defeat\r\nof Wayne, for Howe pressed forward, took possession of Philadelphia,\r\nand encamped the main body of his army at Germantown.\r\n\r\nMeantime Washington, who had not in the least given up his idea of\r\nfighting again, recruited his army, and having a little more than\r\neight thousand men, determined to try another stroke at the British,\r\nwhile they were weakened by detachments. On the night of October 3 he\r\nstarted, and reached Germantown at daybreak on the 4th. At first the\r\nAmericans swept everything before them, and flung the British back\r\nin rout and confusion. Then matters began to go wrong, as is always\r\nlikely to happen when, as in this case, widely separated and yet\r\naccurately concerted action is essential to success. Some of the\r\nBritish threw themselves into a stone house, and instead of leaving\r\nthem there under guard, the whole army stopped to besiege, and a\r\nprecious half hour was lost. Then Greene and Stephen were late in\r\ncoming up, having made a circuit, and although when they arrived all\r\nseemed to go well, the Americans were seized with an inexplicable\r\npanic, and fell back, as Wayne truly said, in the very moment of\r\nvictory. One of those unlucky accidents, utterly unavoidable, but\r\nalways dangerous to extensive combinations, had a principal effect on\r\nthe result. The morning was very misty, and the fog, soon thickened by\r\nthe smoke, caused confusion, random firing, and, worst of all, that\r\nuncertainty of feeling and action which something or nothing converted\r\ninto a panic. Nevertheless, the Americans rallied quickly this time,\r\nand a good retreat was made, under the lead of Greene, until safety\r\nwas reached. The action, while it lasted, had been very sharp, and the\r\nlosses on both sides were severe, the Americans suffering most.\r\n\r\nWashington, as usual when matters went ill, exposed himself\r\nrecklessly, to the great alarm of his generals, but all in vain. He\r\nwas deeply disappointed, and expressed himself so at first, for he saw\r\nthat the men had unaccountably given way when they were on the edge\r\nof victory. The underlying cause was of course, as at Long Island\r\nand Brandywine, the unsteadiness of raw troops, and Washington felt\r\nrightly, after the first sting had passed, that he had really achieved\r\na great deal. Congress applauded the attempt, and when the smoke of\r\nthe battle had cleared away, men generally perceived that its having\r\nbeen fought at all was in reality the important fact. It made also\r\na profound impression upon the French cabinet. Eagerly watching the\r\ncourse of events, they saw the significance of the fact that an army\r\nraised within a year could fight a battle in the open field, endure\r\na severe defeat, and then take the offensive and make a bold and\r\nwell-planned attack, which narrowly missed being overwhelmingly\r\nsuccessful. To the observant and trained eyes of Europe, the defeat\r\nat Germantown made it evident that there was fighting material among\r\nthese untrained colonists, capable of becoming formidable; and that\r\nthere was besides a powerful will and directing mind, capable on\r\nits part of bringing this same material into the required shape and\r\ncondition. To dispassionate onlookers, England's grasp on her colonies\r\nappeared to be slipping away very rapidly. Washington himself saw the\r\nmeaning of it all plainly enough, for it was but the development of\r\nhis theory of carrying on the war.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication, however, that England detected, in all that\r\nhad gone on since her army landed at the Head of Elk, anything more\r\nthan a couple of natural defeats for the rebels. General Howe was\r\nsufficiently impressed to draw in his troops, and keep very closely\r\nshut up in Philadelphia, but his country was not moved at all. The\r\nfact that it had taken forty-seven days to get their army from the\r\nElk River to Philadelphia, and that in that time they had fought two\r\nsuccessful battles and yet had left the American army still active\r\nand menacing, had no effect upon the British mind. The English were\r\nthoroughly satisfied that the colonists were cowards and were sure to\r\nbe defeated, no matter what the actual facts might be. They regarded\r\nWashington as an upstart militia colonel, and they utterly failed to\r\ncomprehend that they had to do with a great soldier, who was able to\r\norganize and lead an army, overcome incredible difficulties, beat and\r\noutgeneral them, bear defeat, and then fight again. They were unable\r\nto realize that the mere fact that such a man could be produced and\r\nsuch an army maintained meant the inevitable loss of colonies three\r\nthousand miles away. Men there were in England, undoubtedly, like\r\nBurke and Fox, who felt and understood the significance of these\r\nthings, but the mass of the people, as well as the aristocracy, the\r\nking, and the cabinet, would have none of them. Rude contempt for\r\nother people is a warming and satisfying feeling, no doubt, and the\r\nEnglish have had unquestionably great satisfaction from its free\r\nindulgence. No one should grudge it to them, least of all Americans.\r\nIt is a comfort for which they have paid, so far as this country is\r\nconcerned, by the loss of their North American colonies, and by a few\r\nother settlements with the United States at other and later times.\r\n\r\nBut although Washington and his army failed to impress England, events\r\nhad happened in the north, during this same summer, which were so\r\nsharp-pointed that they not only impressed the English people keenly\r\nand unpleasantly, but they actually penetrated the dull comprehension\r\nof George III. and his cabinet. \"Why,\" asked an English lady of an\r\nAmerican naval officer, in the year of grace 1887--\"why is your ship\r\nnamed the Saratoga?\" \"Because,\" was the reply, \"at Saratoga an English\r\ngeneral and an English army of more than five thousand men surrendered\r\nto an American army and laid down their arms.\" Although apparently\r\nneglected now in the general scheme of British education, Saratoga\r\nwas a memorable event in the summer of 1777, and the part taken by\r\nWashington in bringing about the great result has never, it would\r\nseem, been properly set forth. There is no need to trace here the\r\nhistory of that campaign, but it is necessary to show how much was\r\ndone by the commander-in-chief, five hundred miles away, to win the\r\nfinal victory.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1776-77 reports came that a general and an army were\r\nto be sent to Canada to invade the colonies from the north by way\r\nof Lake Champlain. The news does not seem to have made a very deep\r\nimpression generally, nor to have been regarded as anything beyond\r\nthe ordinary course of military events. But there was one man,\r\nfortunately, who in an instant perceived the full significance of this\r\nmovement. Washington saw that the English had at last found an idea,\r\nor, at least, a general possessed of one. So long as the British\r\nconfined themselves to fighting one or two battles, and then, taking\r\npossession of a single town, were content to sit down and pass their\r\nwinter in good quarters, leaving the colonists in undisturbed control\r\nof all the rest of the country, there was nothing to be feared. The\r\nresult of such campaigning as this could not be doubtful for a moment\r\nto any clear-sighted man. But when a plan was on foot, which, if\r\nsuccessful, meant the control of the lakes and the Hudson, and of a\r\nline of communication from the north to the great colonial seaport,\r\nthe case was very different. Such a campaign as this would cause\r\nthe complete severance of New England, the chief source for men and\r\nsupplies, from the rest of the colonies. It promised the mastery, not\r\nof a town, but of half a dozen States, and this to the American cause\r\nprobably would be ruin.\r\n\r\nSo strongly and clearly did Washington feel all this that his\r\ncounter-plan was at once ready, and before people had fairly grasped\r\nthe idea that there was to be a northern invasion, he was sending,\r\nearly in March, urgent letters to New England to rouse up the militia\r\nand have them in readiness to march at a moment's notice. To Schuyler,\r\nin command of the northern department, he began now to write\r\nconstantly, and to unfold the methods which must be pursued in order\r\nto compass the defeat of the invaders. His object was to delay the\r\narmy of Burgoyne by every possible device, while steadily avoiding a\r\npitched battle. Then the militia and hardy farmers of New England and\r\nNew York were to be rallied, and were to fall upon the flank and\r\nrear of the British, harass them constantly, cut off their outlying\r\nparties, and finally hem them in and destroy them. If the army and\r\npeople of the North could only be left undisturbed, it is evident from\r\nhis letters that Washington felt no doubt as to the result in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nBut the North included only half the conditions essential to success.\r\nThe grave danger feared by Washington was that Howe would understand\r\nthe situation, and seeing his opportunity, would throw everything else\r\naside, and marching northward with twenty thousand men, would make\r\nhimself master of the Hudson, effect a junction with Burgoyne at\r\nAlbany, and so cut the colonies in twain. From all he could learn,\r\nand from his knowledge of his opponents' character, Washington felt\r\nsatisfied that Howe intended to capture Philadelphia, advancing,\r\nprobably, through the Jerseys. Yet, despite his well-reasoned judgment\r\non this point, it seemed so incredible that any soldier could fail to\r\nsee that decisive victory lay in the north, and in a junction with\r\nBurgoyne, that Washington could not really and fully believe in such\r\nfatuity until he knew that Howe was actually landing at the Head\r\nof Elk. This is the reason for the anxiety displayed in the\r\ncorrespondence of that summer, for the changing and shifting\r\nmovements, and for the obvious hesitation of opinion, so unusual with\r\nWashington at any time. Be it remembered, moreover, that it was an\r\nawful doubt which went to bed and got up and walked with him through\r\nall those long nights and days. If Howe, the dull and lethargic,\r\nshould awake from his dream of conquering America by taking now and\r\nagain an isolated town, and should break for the north with twenty\r\nthousand men, the fortunes of the young republic would come to their\r\nseverest test.\r\n\r\nIn that event, Washington knew well enough what he meant to do. He\r\nwould march his main army to the Hudson, unite with the strong body\r\nof troops which he kept there constantly, contest every inch of the\r\ncountry and the river with Howe, and keep him at all hazards from\r\ngetting to Albany. But he also knew well that if this were done the\r\nodds would be fearfully against him, for Howe would then not only\r\noutnumber him very greatly, but there would be ample time for the\r\nBritish to act, and but a short distance to be covered. We can\r\nimagine, therefore, his profound sense of relief when he found that\r\nHowe and his army were really south of Philadelphia, after a waste of\r\nmany precious weeks. He could now devote himself single-hearted to the\r\ndefense of the city, for distance and time were at last on his side,\r\nand all that remained was to fight Howe so hard and steadily that\r\nneither in victory nor defeat would he remember Burgoyne. Pitt said\r\nthat he would conquer Canada on the plains of Germany, and Burgoyne\r\nwas compelled to surrender in large measure by the campaign of\r\nWashington in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIf we study carefully Washington's correspondence during that eventful\r\nsummer, grouping together that relating to the northern campaign, and\r\ncomparing it with that which dealt with the affairs of his own army,\r\nall that has just been said comes out with entire clearness, and it is\r\nastonishing to see how exactly events justified his foresight. If\r\nhe could only hold Howe in the south, he was quite willing to trust\r\nBurgoyne to the rising of the people and to the northern wilderness.\r\nEvery effort he made was in this direction, beginning, as has been\r\nsaid, by his appeals to the New England governors in March. Schuyler,\r\non his part, was thoroughly imbued with Washington's other leading\r\nidea, that the one way to victory was by retarding the enemy. At the\r\noutset everything went utterly and disastrously wrong. Washington\r\ncounted on an obstinate struggle, and a long delay at Ticonderoga, for\r\nhe had not been on the ground, and could not imagine that our officers\r\nwould fortify everything but the one commanding point.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the forts appalled the country and disappointed\r\nWashington, but did not shake his nerve for an instant. He wrote to\r\nSchuyler: \"This stroke is severe indeed, and has distressed us much.\r\nBut notwithstanding things at present have a dark and gloomy aspect,\r\nI hope a spirited opposition will check the progress of General\r\nBurgoyne's army, and that the confidence derived from his success will\r\nhurry him into measures that will, in their consequences, be favorable\r\nto us. We should never despair; our situation has before been\r\nunpromising, and has changed for the better; so I trust it will again.\r\nIf new difficulties arise we must only put forth new exertions, and\r\nproportion our efforts to the exigency of the times.\" Even after this\r\nseemingly crushing defeat he still felt sure of Burgoyne, so long as\r\nhe was unsupported. Suiting the action to the word, he again bent\r\nevery nerve to rouse New England and get out her militia. When he was\r\nsatisfied that Howe was landing below Philadelphia, the first thing he\r\ndid was to send forth the same cry in the same quarter, to bring out\r\nmore men against Burgoyne. He showed, too, the utmost generosity\r\ntoward the northern army, sending thither all the troops he could\r\npossibly spare, and even parting with his favorite corps of Morgan's\r\nriflemen. Despite his liberality, the commanders in the north\r\nwere unreasonable in their demands, and when they asked too much,\r\nWashington flatly declined to send more men, for he would not weaken\r\nhimself unduly, and he knew what they did not see, that the fate of\r\nthe northern invasion turned largely on his own ability to cope with\r\nHowe.\r\n\r\nThe blame for the loss of the forts fell of course upon Schuyler,\r\nwho was none too popular in Congress, and who with St. Clair was\r\naccordingly made a scape-goat. Congress voted that Washington should\r\nappoint a new commander, and the New England delegates visited him to\r\nurge the selection of Gates. This task Washington refused to perform,\r\nalleging as a reason that the northern department had always been\r\nconsidered a separate command, and that he had never done more than\r\nadvise. These reasons do not look very weighty or very strong, and it\r\nis not quite clear what the underlying motive was. Washington never\r\nshrank from responsibility, and he knew very well that he could pick\r\nout the best man more unerringly than Congress. But he also saw\r\nthat Congress favored Gates, whom he would not have chosen, and he\r\ntherefore probably felt that it was more important to have some one\r\nwhom New England believed in and approved than a better soldier who\r\nwould have been unwelcome to her representatives. It is certain that\r\nhe would not have acted thus, had he thought that generalship was an\r\nimportant element in the problem; but he relied on a popular uprising,\r\nand not on the commander, to defeat Burgoyne. He may have thought,\r\ntoo, that it was a mistake to relieve Schuyler, who was working in the\r\ndirections which he had pointed out, and who, if not a great soldier,\r\nwas a brave, high-minded, and sensible man, devoted to his chief and\r\nto the country. It was Schuyler indeed who, by his persistent labor in\r\nbreaking down bridges, tearing up roads, and felling trees, while he\r\ngathered men industriously in all directions, did more than any one\r\nelse at that moment to prepare the way for an ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nWhatever his feelings may have been in regard to the command of the\r\nnorthern department, Washington made no change in his own course after\r\nGates had been appointed. He knew that Gates was at least harmless,\r\nand not likely to block the natural course of events. He therefore\r\nfelt free to press his own policy without cessation, and without\r\napprehension. He took care that Lincoln and Arnold should be there to\r\nlook after the New England militia, and he wrote to Governor Clinton,\r\nin whose energy and courage he had great confidence, to rouse up the\r\nmen of New York. He suggested the points of attack, and at every\r\nmoment advised and counseled and watched, holding all the while a firm\r\ngrip on Howe. Slowly and surely the net, thus painfully set, tightened\r\nround Burgoyne. The New Englanders whipped one division at Bennington,\r\nand the New Yorkers shattered another at Oriskany and Fort Schuyler.\r\nThe country people turned out in defense of their invaded homes and\r\npoured into the American camp. Burgoyne struggled and advanced,\r\nfought and retreated. Gates, stupid, lethargic, and good-natured, did\r\nnothing, but there was no need of generalship; and Arnold was there,\r\nturbulent and quarrelsome, but full of daring; and Morgan, too,\r\nequally ready; and they and others did all the necessary fighting.\r\n\r\nPoor Burgoyne, a brave gentleman, if not a great general, had\r\nthe misfortune to be a clever man in the service of a stupid\r\nadministration, and he met the fate usually meted out under such\r\ncircumstances to men of ideas. Howe went off to the conquest of\r\nPhiladelphia, Clinton made a brief burning and plundering raid up the\r\nriver, and the northern invasion, which really had meaning, was left\r\nto its fate. It was a hard fate, but there was no escape. Outnumbered,\r\nbeaten, and caught, Burgoyne surrendered. If there had been a\r\nfighting-man at the head of the American army, the British would have\r\nsurrendered as prisoners of war, and not on conditions. Schuyler, we\r\nmay be sure, whatever his failings, would never have let them off\r\nso easily. But it was sufficient as it was. The wilderness, and the\r\nmilitia of New York and New England swarming to the defense of their\r\nhomes, had done the work. It all fell out just as Washington had\r\nforeseen and planned, and England, despising her enemy and their\r\ncommander, saw one of her armies surrender, and might have known, if\r\nshe had had the wit, that the colonies were now lost forever. The\r\nRevolution had been saved at Trenton; it was established at Saratoga.\r\nIn the one case it was the direct, in the other the indirect, work of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nPoor Gates, with his dull brain turning under the impression that this\r\ncrowning mercy had been his own doing, lost his head, forgot that\r\nthere was a commander-in-chief, and sending his news to Congress, left\r\nWashington to find out from chance rumors, and a tardy letter from\r\nPutnam, that Burgoyne had actually surrendered. This gross slight,\r\nhowever, had deeper roots than the mere exultation of victory acting\r\non a heavy and common mind. It represented a hostile feeling which\r\nhad been slowly increasing for some time, which had been carefully\r\nnurtured by those interested in its growth, and which blossomed\r\nrapidly in the heated air of military triumph. From the outset it had\r\nbeen Washington's business to fight the enemy, manage the army,\r\ndeal with Congress, and consider in all its bearings the political\r\nsituation at home and abroad; but he was now called upon to meet a\r\ntrouble outside the line of duty, and to face attacks from within,\r\nwhich, ideally speaking, ought never to have existed, but which, in\r\nview of our very fallible humanity, were certain to come sooner or\r\nlater. Much domestic malice Washington was destined to encounter in\r\nthe later years of political strife, but this was the only instance in\r\nhis military career where enmity came to overt action and open speech.\r\nThe first and the last of its kind, this assault upon him has much\r\ninterest, for a strong light is thrown upon his character by studying\r\nhim, thus beset, and by seeing just how he passed through this most\r\ntrying and disagreeable of ordeals.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the difficulties was to be found where we should expect\r\nit, in the differences between the men of speech and the man of\r\naction, between the lawmakers and the soldier. Washington had been\r\nobliged to tell Congress a great many plain and unpleasant truths.\r\nIt was part of his duty, and he did it accordingly. He was always\r\ndignified, calm, and courteous, but he had an alarmingly direct way\r\nwith him, especially when he was annoyed. He was simple almost to\r\nbluntness, but now and then would use a grave irony which must\r\nhave made listening ears tingle. Congress was patriotic and\r\nwell-intentioned, and on the whole stood bravely by its general,\r\nbut it was unversed in war, very impatient, and at times wildly\r\nimpracticable. Here is a letter which depicts the situation, and the\r\nrelation between the general and his rulers, with great clearness.\r\nMarch 14, 1777, Washington wrote to the President: \"Could I accomplish\r\nthe important objects so eagerly wished by Congress,--'confining the\r\nenemy within their present quarters, preventing their getting\r\nsupplies from the country, and totally subduing them before they are\r\nreinforced,'--I should be happy indeed. But what prospect or hope can\r\nthere be of my effecting so desirable a work at this time?\"\r\n\r\nWe can imagine how exasperating such requests and suggestions must\r\nhave been. It was very much as if Congress had said: \"Good General,\r\nbring in the Atlantic tides and drown the enemy; or pluck the moon\r\nfrom the sky and give it to us, as a mark of your loyalty.\" Such\r\nrequests are not soothing to any man struggling his best with great\r\nanxieties, and with a host of petty cares. Washington, nevertheless,\r\nkept his temper, and replied only by setting down a few hard facts\r\nwhich answered the demands of Congress in a final manner, and with all\r\nthe sting of truth. Thus a little irritation had been generated\r\nin Congress against the general, and there were some members who\r\ndeveloped a good deal of pronounced hostility. Sam Adams, a born\r\nagitator and a trained politician, unequaled almost in our history as\r\nan organizer and manager of men, able, narrow, coldly fierce, the man\r\nof the town meeting and the caucus, had no possibility of intellectual\r\nsympathy with the silent, patient, hard-gripping soldier, hemmed with\r\ndifficulties, but ever moving straight forward to his object, with\r\noccasional wild gusts of reckless fighting passion. John Adams, too,\r\nbrilliant of speech and pen, ardent, patriotic, and high-minded,\r\nwas, in his way, out of touch with Washington. Although he moved\r\nWashington's appointment, he began almost immediately to find fault\r\nwith him, an exercise to which he was extremely prone. Inasmuch as he\r\ncould see how things ought to be done, he could not understand\r\nwhy they were not done in that way at once, for he had a fine\r\nforgetfulness of other people's difficulties, as is the case with most\r\nof us. The New England representatives generally took their cue from\r\nthese two, especially James Lovell, who carried his ideas into action,\r\nand obtained a little niche in the temple of fame by making\r\nhimself disagreeably conspicuous in the intrigue against the\r\ncommander-in-chief, when it finally developed.\r\n\r\nThere were others, too, outside New England who were discontented, and\r\namong them Richard Henry Lee, from the General's own State. He was\r\nevidently critical and somewhat unfriendly at this time, although the\r\nreasons for his being so are not now very distinct. Then there was Mr.\r\nClark of New Jersey, an excellent man, who thought the General was\r\ninvading popular rights; and to him others might be added who vaguely\r\nfelt that things ought to be better than they were. This party,\r\nadverse to Washington, obtained the appointment of Gates to the\r\nnorthern department, under whom the army won a great victory, and they\r\nwere correspondingly happy. John Adams wrote his wife that one\r\ncause of thanksgiving was that the tide had not been turned by the\r\ncommander-in-chief and southern troops, for the adulation would have\r\nbeen intolerable; and that a man may be wise and virtuous and not a\r\ndeity.\r\n\r\nHere, so far as the leading and influential men were concerned, the\r\nmatter would have dropped, probably; but there were lesser men like\r\nLovell who were much encouraged by the surrender of Burgoyne, and who\r\nthought that they now might supplant Washington with Gates. Before\r\nlong, too, they found in the army itself some active and not\r\nover-scrupulous allies. The most conspicuous figure among the military\r\nmalcontents was Gates himself, who, although sluggish in all things,\r\nstill had a keen eye for his own advancement. He showed plainly how\r\nmuch his head had been turned by the victory at Saratoga when he\r\nfailed to inform Washington of the fact, and when he afterward delayed\r\nsending back troops until he was driven to it by the determined energy\r\nof Hamilton, who was sent to bring him to reason. Next in importance\r\nto Gates was Thomas Mifflin, an ardent patriot, but a rather\r\nlight-headed person, who espoused the opposition to Washington for\r\ncauses now somewhat misty, but among which personal vanity played no\r\ninconsiderable part. About these two leaders gathered a certain number\r\nof inferior officers of no great moment then or since.\r\n\r\nThe active and moving spirit in the party, however, was one Conway, an\r\nIrish adventurer, who made himself so prominent that the whole affair\r\npassed into history bearing his name, and the \"Conway cabal\" has\r\nobtained an enduring notoriety which its hero never acquired by any\r\npublic services. Conway was one of the foreign officers who had gained\r\nthe favor of Congress and held the rank of brigadier-general, but this\r\nby no means filled the measure of his pretensions, and when De Kalb\r\nwas made a major-general Conway immediately started forward with\r\nclaims to the same rank. He received strong support from the factious\r\nopposition, and there was so much stir that Washington sharply\r\ninterfered, for to his general objection to these lavish gifts of\r\nexcessive rank was added an especial distrust in this particular\r\ncase. In his calm way he had evidently observed Conway, and with his\r\nunerring judgment of men had found him wanting. \"I may add,\" he wrote\r\nto Lee, \"and I think with truth, that it will give a fatal blow to\r\nthe existence of the army. Upon so interesting a subject I must speak\r\nplainly. General Conway's merit then as an officer, and his importance\r\nin this army, exist more in his own imagination than in reality.\"\r\nThis plain talk soon reached Conway, drove him at once into furious\r\nopposition, and caused him to impart to the faction a cohesion and\r\nvigor which they had before lacked. Circumstances favored them. The\r\nvictory at Saratoga gave them something tangible to go upon, and the\r\nfirst move was made when Gates failed to inform Washington of the\r\nsurrender, and then held back the troops sent for so urgently by the\r\ncommander-in-chief, who had sacrificed so much from his own army to\r\nsecure that of the north.\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, indeed, when Washington was calling for troops,\r\nhe was struggling with the utmost tenacity to hold control of the\r\nDelaware. He made every arrangement possible to maintain the forts,\r\nand the first assaults upon them were repulsed with great slaughter,\r\nthe British in the attack on Fort Mercer losing Count Donop, the\r\nleader, and four hundred men. Then came a breathing space, and then\r\nthe attacks were renewed, supported by vessels, and both forts were\r\nabandoned after the works had been leveled to the ground by the\r\nenemy's fire. Meanwhile Hamilton, sent to the north, had done his\r\nwork; Gates had been stirred, and Putnam, well-meaning but stubborn,\r\nhad been sharply brought to his bearings. Reinforcements had come, and\r\nWashington meditated an attack on Philadelphia. There was a good deal\r\nof clamor for something brilliant and decisive, for both the army and\r\nthe public were a little dizzy from the effects of Saratoga, and with\r\nsublime blindness to different conditions, could not see why the same\r\nperformance should not be repeated to order everywhere else. To oppose\r\nthis wish was trying, doubly trying to a man eager to fight, and with\r\nhis full share of the very human desire to be as successful as his\r\nneighbor. It required great nerve to say No; but Washington did not\r\nlack that quality, and as general and statesman he reconnoitred the\r\nenemy's works, weighed the chances, said No decisively, and took up an\r\nalmost impregnable position at White Marsh. Thereupon Howe announced\r\nthat he would drive Washington beyond the mountains, and on December\r\n4 he approached the American lines with this highly proper purpose.\r\nThere was some skirmishing along the foot of the hills of an\r\nunimportant character, and on the third day Washington, in high\r\nspirits, thought an attack would be made, and rode among the soldiers\r\ndirecting and encouraging them. Nothing came of it, however, but more\r\nskirmishing, and the next day Howe marched back to Philadelphia. He\r\nhad offered battle in all ways, he had invited action; but again, with\r\nthe same pressure both from his own spirit and from public opinion,\r\nWashington had said No. On his own ground he was more than ready to\r\nfight Howe, but despite the terrible temptation he would fight on no\r\nother. Not the least brilliant exploit of Wellington was the retreat\r\nto the shrewdly prepared lines of Torres Vedras, and one of the most\r\ndifficult successes of Washington was his double refusal to fight as\r\nthe year 1777 drew to a close.\r\n\r\nLike most right and wise things, Washington's action looks now, a\r\ncentury later, so plainly sensible that it is hard to imagine how any\r\none could have questioned it; and one cannot, without a great effort,\r\nrealize the awful strain upon will and temper involved in thus\r\nrefusing battle. If the proposed attack on Philadelphia had failed, or\r\nif our army had come down from the hills and been beaten in the fields\r\nbelow, no American army would have remained. The army of the north, of\r\nwhich men were talking so proudly, had done its work and dispersed.\r\nThe fate of the Revolution rested where it had been from the\r\nbeginning, with Washington and his soldiers. Drive them beyond the\r\nmountains and there was no other army to fall back upon. On their\r\nexistence everything hinged, and when Howe got back to Philadelphia,\r\nthere they were still existent, still coherent, hovering on his flank,\r\ncooping him up in his lines, and leaving him master of little more\r\nthan the ground his men encamped upon, and the streets his sentinels\r\npatrolled. When Franklin was told in Paris that Howe had taken\r\nPhiladelphia, his reply was, \"Philadelphia has taken Howe.\"\r\n\r\nBut, with the exception of Franklin, contemporary opinion in the month\r\nof December, 1777, was very different from that of to-day, and the\r\ncabal had been at work ever since the commander-in-chief had stepped\r\nbetween Conway and the exorbitant rank he coveted. Washington, indeed,\r\nwas perfectly aware of what was going on. He was quiet and dignified,\r\nimpassive and silent, but he knew when men, whether great or small,\r\nwere plotting against him, and he watched them with the same keenness\r\nas he did Howe and the British.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his struggle to hold the Delaware forts, and of his\r\nefforts to get back his troops from the north, a story came to him\r\nthat arrested his attention. Wilkinson, of Gates's staff, had come to\r\nCongress with the news of the surrender. He had been fifteen days on\r\nthe road and three days getting his papers in order, and when it was\r\nproposed to give him a sword, Roger Sherman suggested that they had\r\nbetter \"give the lad a pair of spurs.\" This thrust and some delay\r\nseem to have nettled Wilkinson, who was swelling with importance, and\r\nalthough he was finally made a brigadier-general, he rode off to the\r\nnorth much ruffled. In later years Wilkinson was secretive enough; but\r\nin his hot youth he could not hold his tongue, and on his way back to\r\nGates he talked. What he said was marked and carried to headquarters,\r\nand on November 9 Washington wrote to Conway:--\r\n\r\n    \"A letter which I received last night contained the following\r\n    paragraph,--'In a letter from General Conway to General Gates he\r\n    says, \"_Heaven has determined to save your country, or a weak\r\n    general and bad counsellors would have ruined it_\" I am, sir, your\r\n    humble servant,'\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis curt note fell upon Conway with stunning effect. It is said that\r\nhe tried to apologize, and he certainly resigned. As for Gates, he\r\nfell to writing letters filled with expressions of wonder as to who\r\nhad betrayed him, and writhed most pitiably under the exposure.\r\nWashington's replies are models of cold dignity, and the calm\r\nindifference with which he treated the whole matter, while holding\r\nGates to the point with relentless grasp, is very interesting. The\r\ncabal was seriously shaken by this sudden blow. It must have dawned\r\nupon them dimly that they might have mistaken their man, and that the\r\nsilent soldier was perhaps not so easy to dispose of by an intrigue as\r\nthey had fancied. Nevertheless, they rallied, and taking advantage of\r\nthe feeling in Congress created by Burgoyne's surrender, they set to\r\nwork to get control of military matters. The board of war was enlarged\r\nto five, with Gates at its head and Mifflin a member, and, thus\r\nconstituted, it proceeded to make Conway inspector-general, with the\r\nrank of major-general. This, after Conway's conduct, was a direct\r\ninsult to Washington, and marks the highest point attained by his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nIn Congress, too, they became more active, and John Jay said that\r\nthere was in that body a party bitterly hostile to Washington. We know\r\nlittle of the members of that faction now, for they never took the\r\ntrouble to refer to the matter in after years, and did everything that\r\nsilence could do to have it all forgotten. But the party existed none\r\nthe less, and significant letters have come down to us, one of them\r\nwritten by Lovell, and two anonymous, addressed respectively to\r\nPatrick Henry and to Laurens, then president, which show a bitter and\r\nvindictive spirit, and breathe but one purpose. The same thought is\r\nconstantly reiterated, that with a good general the northern army had\r\nwon a great victory, and that the main army, if commanded in the same\r\nway, would do likewise. The plan was simple and coherent. The cabal\r\nwished to drive Washington out of power and replace him with Gates.\r\nWith this purpose they wrote to Henry and Laurens; with this purpose\r\nthey made Conway inspector-general.\r\n\r\nWhen they turned from intrigue to action, however, they began to fail.\r\nOne of their pet schemes was the conquest of Canada, and with\r\nthis object Lafayette was sent to the lakes, only to find that no\r\npreparations had been made, because the originators of the idea were\r\nignorant and inefficient. The expedition promptly collapsed and was\r\nabandoned, with much instruction in consequence to Congress and\r\npeople. Under their control the commissariat also went hopelessly to\r\npieces, and a committee of Congress proceeded to Valley Forge and\r\nfound that in this direction, too, the new managers had grievously\r\nfailed. Then the original Conway letter, uncovered so unceremoniously\r\nby Washington, kept returning to plague its author. Gates's\r\ncorrespondence went on all through the winter, and with every letter\r\nGates floundered more and more, and Washington's replies grew more\r\nand more freezing and severe. Gates undertook to throw the blame on\r\nWilkinson, who became loftily indignant and challenged him. The two\r\nmade up their quarrel very soon in a ludicrous manner, but Wilkinson\r\nin the interval had an interview with Washington, which revealed an\r\namount of duplicity and perfidy on the part of the cabal, so shocking\r\nto the former's sensitive nature, that he resigned his secretaryship\r\nof the board of war on account, as he frankly said, of the treachery\r\nand falsehood of Gates. Such a quarrel of course hurt the cabal, but\r\nit was still more weakened by Gates himself, whose only idea seemed\r\nto be to supersede Washington by slighting him, refusing troops, and\r\ndeclining to propose his health at dinner,--methods as unusual as they\r\nwere feeble.\r\n\r\nThe cabal, in fact, was so weak in ability and character that the\r\nmoment any responsibility fell upon its members it was certain to\r\nbreak down, but the absolutely fatal obstacle to its schemes was the\r\nman it aimed to overthrow. The idea evidently was that Washington\r\ncould be driven to resign. They knew that they could not get either\r\nCongress or public opinion to support them in removing him, but they\r\nbelieved that a few well-placed slights and insults would make him\r\nremove himself. It was just here that they made their mistake.\r\nWashington, as they were aware, was sensitive and high-spirited to\r\nthe last degree, and he had no love for office, but he was not one of\r\nthose weaklings who leave power and place in a pet because they are\r\ncriticised and assailed. He was not ambitious in the ordinary personal\r\nsense, but he had a passion for success. Whether it was breaking a\r\nhorse, or reclaiming land, or fighting Indians, or saving a state,\r\nwhatever he set his hand to, that he carried through to the end. With\r\nhim there never was any shadow of turning back. When, without any\r\nself-seeking, he was placed at the head of the Revolution, he made\r\nup his mind that he would carry it through everything to victory, if\r\nvictory were possible. Death or a prison could stop him, but neither\r\ndefeat nor neglect, and still less the forces of intrigue and cabal.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote to his brother announcing Burgoyne's surrender, he had\r\nnothing to say of the slight Gates put upon him, but merely added in\r\na postscript, \"I most devoutly congratulate my country and every\r\nwell-wisher to the cause on this signal stroke of Providence.\" This\r\nwas his tone to every one, both in private and public. His complaint\r\nof not being properly notified he made to Gates alone, and put it in\r\nthe form of a rebuke. He knew of the movement against him from the\r\nbeginning, but apparently the first person he confided in was Conway,\r\nwhen he sent him the brief note of November 9. Even after the cabal\r\nwas fully developed, he wrote about it only once or twice, when\r\ncompelled to do so, and there is no evidence that he ever talked about\r\nit except, perhaps, to a few most intimate friends. In a letter to\r\nPatrick Henry he said that he was obliged to allow a false impression\r\nas to his strength to go abroad, and that he suffered in consequence;\r\nand he added, with a little touch of feeling, that while the\r\nyeomanry of New York and New England poured into the camp of Gates,\r\noutnumbering the enemy two to one, he could get no aid of that sort\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, and still marvels were demanded of him.\r\n\r\nThus he went on his way through the winter, silent except when obliged\r\nto answer some friend, and always ready to meet his enemies. When\r\nConway complained to Congress of his reception at camp, Washington\r\nwrote the president that he was not given to dissimulation, and that\r\nhe certainly had been cold in his manner. He wrote to Lafayette that\r\nslander had been busy, and that he had urged his officers to be\r\ncool and dispassionate as to Conway, adding, \"I have no doubt that\r\neverything happens for the best, that we shall triumph over all our\r\nmisfortunes, and in the end be happy; when, my dear Marquis, if you\r\nwill give me your company in Virginia, we will laugh at our past\r\ndifficulties and the folly of others.\" But though he wrote thus\r\nlightly to his friends, he followed Gates sternly enough, and kept\r\nthat gentleman occupied as he drove him from point to point. Among\r\nother things he touched upon Conway's character with sharp irony,\r\nsaying, \"It is, however, greatly to be lamented that this adept in\r\nmilitary science did not employ his abilities in the progress of the\r\ncampaign, in pointing out those wise measures which were calculated to\r\ngive us 'that degree of success we could reasonably expect.'\"\r\n\r\nPoor Gates did not find these letters pleasant reading, and one more\r\ncurt note, on February 24, finished the controversy. By that time the\r\ncabal was falling to pieces, and in a little while was dispersed.\r\nWilkinson's resignation was accepted, Mifflin was put under\r\nWashington's orders, and Gates was sent to his command in the north.\r\nConway resigned one day in a pet, and found his resignation accepted\r\nand his power gone with unpleasant suddenness. He then got into a\r\nquarrel with General Cadwalader on account of his attacks on the\r\ncommander-in-chief. The quarrel ended in a duel. Conway was badly\r\nwounded, and thinking himself dying, wrote a contrite note of apology\r\nto Washington, then recovered, left the country, and disappeared from\r\nthe ken of history. Thus domestic malice and the \"bitter party\" in\r\nCongress failed and perished. They had dashed themselves in vain\r\nagainst the strong man who held firmly both soldiers and people.\r\n\"While the public are satisfied with my endeavors, I mean not to\r\nshrink from the cause.\" So Washington wrote to Gordon as the cabal\r\nwas coming to an end, and in that spirit he crushed silently and\r\nthoroughly the faction that sought to thwart his purpose, and drive\r\nhim from office by sneers, slights, and intrigues.\r\n\r\nThese attacks upon him came at the darkest moment of his military\r\ncareer. Defeated at Brandywine and Germantown, he had been forced from\r\nthe forts after a desperate struggle, had seen Philadelphia and the\r\nriver fall completely into the hands of the enemy, and, bitterest of\r\nall, he had been obliged to hold back from another assault on the\r\nBritish lines, and to content himself with baffling Howe when that\r\ngentleman came out and offered battle. Then the enemy withdrew to\r\ntheir comfortable quarters, and he was left to face again the harsh\r\nwinter and the problem of existence. It was the same ever recurring\r\neffort to keep the American army, and thereby the American Revolution,\r\nalive. There was nothing in this task to stir the blood and rouse the\r\nheart. It was merely a question of grim tenacity of purpose and of the\r\nability to comprehend its overwhelming importance. It was not a work\r\nthat appealed to or inspirited any one, and to carry it through to a\r\nsuccessful issue rested with the commander-in-chief alone.\r\n\r\nIn the frost and snow he withdrew to Valley Forge, within easy\r\nstriking distance of Philadelphia. He had literally nothing to rely\r\nupon but his own stern will and strong head. His soldiers, steadily\r\ndwindling in numbers, marked their road to Valley Forge by the blood\r\nfrom their naked feet. They were destitute and in rags. When they\r\nreached their destination they had no shelter, and it was only by the\r\nenergy and ingenuity of the General that they were led to build huts,\r\nand thus secure a measure of protection against the weather. There\r\nwere literally no supplies, and the Board of War failed completely to\r\nremedy the evil. The army was in such straits that it was obliged\r\nto seize by force the commonest necessaries. This was a desperate\r\nexpedient and shocked public opinion, which Washington, as a\r\nstatesman, watched and cultivated as an essential element of success\r\nin his difficult business. He disliked to take extreme measures, but\r\nthere was nothing else to be done when his men were starving, when\r\nnearly three thousand of them were unfit for duty because \"barefoot\r\nand otherwise naked,\" and when a large part of the army were obliged\r\nto sit up all night by the fires for warmth's sake, having no blankets\r\nwith which to cover themselves if they lay down. With nothing to eat,\r\nnothing to burn, nothing wherewith to clothe themselves, wasting away\r\nfrom exposure and disease, we can only wonder at the forbearance which\r\nstayed the hand of violent seizure so long. Yet, as Washington had\r\nforeseen, there was even then an outcry against him. Nevertheless, his\r\naction ultimately did more good than harm in the very matter of public\r\nopinion, for it opened men's eyes, and led to some tardy improvements\r\nand some increased effort.\r\n\r\nWorse even than this criticism was the remonstrance of the legislature\r\nof Pennsylvania against the going into winter-quarters. They expected\r\nWashington to keep the open field, and even to attack the British,\r\nwith his starving, ragged army, in all the severity of a northern\r\nwinter. They had failed him at every point and in every promise, in\r\nmen, clothing, and supplies. They were not content that he covered\r\ntheir State and kept the Revolution alive among the huts of Valley\r\nForge. They wished the impossible. They asked for the moon, and then\r\ncried out because it was not given to them. It was a stupid, unkind\r\nthing to do, and Washington answered their complaints in a letter to\r\nthe president of Congress. After setting forth the shortcomings of the\r\nPennsylvanians in the very plainest of plain English, he said: \"But\r\nwhat makes this matter still more extraordinary in my eye is that\r\nthese very gentlemen should think a winter's campaign, and the\r\ncovering of these States from the invasion of an enemy, so easy and\r\npracticable a business. I can answer those gentlemen, that it is a\r\nmuch easier and less distressing thing to draw remonstrances in a\r\ncomfortable room, by a good fireside, than to occupy a cold, bleak\r\nhill, and sleep under frost and snow, without clothes or blankets.\r\nHowever, although they seem to have little feeling for the naked and\r\ndistressed soldiers, I feel superabundantly for them, and from my soul\r\nI pity those miseries which it is neither in my power to relieve or\r\nprevent.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not a safe man for the gentlemen of Pennsylvania to cross too\r\nfar, nor could they swerve him, with all his sense of public opinion,\r\none jot from what he meant to do. In the stern rebuke, and in the\r\ndeep pathos of these sentences, we catch a glimpse of the silent and\r\nself-controlled man breaking out for a moment as he thinks of his\r\nfaithful and suffering men. Whatever happened, he would hold them\r\ntogether, for in this black time we detect the fear which haunted\r\nhim, that the people at large might give way. He was determined on\r\nindependence. He felt a keen hatred against England for her whole\r\nconduct toward America, and this hatred was sharpened by the efforts\r\nof the English to injure him personally by forged letters and other\r\ndespicable contrivances. He was resolved that England should never\r\nprevail, and his language in regard to her has a fierceness of tone\r\nwhich is full of meaning. He was bent, also, on success, and if under\r\nthe long strain the people should weaken or waver, he was determined\r\nto maintain the army at all hazards.\r\n\r\nSo, while he struggled against cold and hunger and destitution,\r\nwhile he contended with faction at home and lukewarmness in the\r\nadministration of the war, even then, in the midst of these trials, he\r\nwas devising a new system for the organization and permanence of his\r\nforces. Congress meddled with the matter of prisoners and with the\r\npromotion of officers, and he argued with and checked them, and still\r\npressed on in his plans. He insisted that officers must have better\r\nprovision, for they had begun to resign. \"You must appeal to their\r\ninterest as well as to their patriotism,\" he wrote, \"and you must give\r\nthem half-pay and full pay in proper measure.\" \"You must follow the\r\nsame policy with the men,\" he said; \"you must have done with short\r\nenlistments. In a word, gentlemen, you must give me an army,\r\na lasting, enduring, continental army, for therein lies\r\nindependence.\"[1] It all comes out now, through the dust of details\r\nand annoyances, through the misery and suffering of that wretched\r\nwinter, through the shrill cries of ignorance and hostility,--the\r\ngreat, clear, strong policy which meant to substitute an army for\r\nmilitia, and thereby secure victory and independence. It is the burden\r\nof all his letters to the governors of States, and to his officers\r\neverywhere. \"I will hold the army together,\" he said, \"but you on all\r\nsides must help me build it up.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These two quotations are not literal, of course, but give\r\nthe substance of many letters.]\r\n\r\nThus with much strenuous labor and many fervent appeals he held his\r\narmy together in some way, and slowly improved it. His system began to\r\nbe put in force, his reiterated lessons were coming home to Congress,\r\nand his reforms and suggestions were in some measure adopted. Under\r\nthe sound and trained guidance of Baron Steuben a drill and discipline\r\nwere introduced, which soon showed marked results. Greene succeeded\r\nMifflin as quartermaster-general, and brought order out of chaos. The\r\nConway cabal went to pieces, and as spring opened Washington began to\r\nsee light once more. To have held on through that winter was a great\r\nfeat, but to have built up and improved the army at such a time was\r\nmuch more wonderful. It shows a greatness of character and a force of\r\nwill rarer than military genius, and enables us to understand better,\r\nperhaps, than almost any of his victories, why it was that the success\r\nof the Revolution lay in such large measure in the hands of one man.\r\n\r\nAfter Howe's withdrawal from the Jerseys in the previous year, a\r\ncontemporary wrote that Washington was left with the remnants of an\r\narmy \"to scuffle for liberty.\" The winter had passed, and he was\r\nprepared to scuffle again. On May 11 Sir Henry Clinton relieved Sir\r\nWilliam Howe at Philadelphia, and the latter took his departure in\r\na blaze of mock glory and resplendent millinery, known as the\r\nMischianza, a fit close to a career of failure, which he was too dull\r\nto appreciate. The new commander was more active than his predecessor,\r\nbut no cleverer, and no better fitted to cope with Washington. It was\r\nanother characteristic choice on the part of the British ministry, who\r\ncould never muster enough intellect to understand that the Americans\r\nwould fight, and that they were led by a really great soldier. The\r\ncoming of Clinton did not alter existing conditions.\r\n\r\nExpecting a movement by the enemy, Washington sent Lafayette forward\r\nto watch Philadelphia. Clinton and Howe, eager for a victory before\r\ndeparture, determined to cut him off, and by a rapid movement nearly\r\nsucceeded in so doing. Timely information, presence of mind, and\r\nquickness alone enabled the young Frenchman to escape, narrowly but\r\ncompletely. Meantime, a cause for delay, that curse of the British\r\nthroughout the war, supervened. A peace commission, consisting of the\r\nEarl of Carlisle, William Eden, and Governor Johnstone, arrived. They\r\nwere excellent men, but they came too late. Their propositions three\r\nyears before would have been well enough, but as it was they were\r\nworse than nothing. Coolly received, they held a fruitless interview\r\nwith a committee of Congress, tried to bribe and intrigue, found that\r\ntheir own army had been already ordered to evacuate Philadelphia\r\nwithout their knowledge, and finally gave up their task in\r\nangry despair, and returned to England to join in the chorus of\r\nfault-finding which was beginning to sound very loud in ministerial\r\nears.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Washington waited and watched, puzzled by the delay, and\r\nhoping only to harass Sir Henry with militia on the march to New York.\r\nBut as the days slipped by, the Americans grew stronger, while the\r\nBritish had been weakened by wholesale desertions. When he finally\r\nstarted, he had with him probably sixteen to seventeen thousand men,\r\nwhile the Americans had apparently at least thirteen thousand, nearly\r\nall continental troops.[1] Under these circumstances, Washington\r\ndetermined to bring on a battle. He was thwarted at the outset by his\r\nofficers, as was wont to be the case. Lee had returned more whimsical\r\nthan ever, and at the moment was strongly adverse to an attack, and\r\nwas full of wise saws about building a bridge of gold for the flying\r\nenemy. The ascendancy which, as an English officer, he still retained\r\nenabled him to get a certain following, and the councils of war\r\nwhich were held compared unfavorably, as Hamilton put it, with the\r\ndeliberations of midwives. Washington was harassed of course by all\r\nthis, but he did not stay his purpose, and as soon as he knew that\r\nClinton actually had marched, he broke camp at Valley Forge and\r\nstarted in pursuit. There were more councils of an old-womanish\r\ncharacter, but finally Washington took the matter into his own\r\nhands, and ordered forth a strong detachment to attack the British\r\nrear-guard. They set out on the 25th, and as Lee, to whom the command\r\nbelonged, did not care to go, Lafayette was put in charge. As soon as\r\nLafayette had departed, however, Lee changed his mind, and insisted\r\nthat all the detachments in front, amounting to five thousand men,\r\nformed a division so large that it was unjust not to give him the\r\ncommand. Washington, therefore, sent him forward next day with two\r\nadditional brigades, and then Lee by seniority took command on the\r\n27th of the entire advance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The authorities are hopelessly conflicting as to the\r\nnumbers on both sides. The British returns on March 26 showed over\r\n19,000 men. They had since that date been weakened by desertions, but\r\nto what extent we can only conjecture. The detachments to Florida\r\nand the West Indies ordered from England do not appear to have taken\r\nplace. The estimate of 16,000 to 17,000 seems the most reasonable.\r\nWashington returned his rank and file as just over 10,000, which would\r\nindicate a total force of 13,000 to 14,000, possibly more. Washington\r\nclearly underestimated the enemy, and the best conclusion seems to be\r\nthat they were nearly matched in numbers, with a slight inferiority on\r\nthe American side.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening of that day, Washington came up, reconnoitred the\r\nenemy, and saw that, although their position was a strong one, another\r\nday's unmolested march would make it still stronger. He therefore\r\nresolved to attack the next morning, and gave Lee then and there\r\nexplicit orders to that effect. In the early dawn he dispatched\r\nsimilar orders, but Lee apparently did nothing except move feebly\r\nforward, saying to Lafayette, \"You don't know the British soldiers;\r\nwe cannot stand against them.\" He made a weak attempt to cut off a\r\ncovering party, marched and countermarched, ordered and countermanded,\r\nuntil Lafayette and Wayne, eager to fight, knew not what to do, and\r\nsent hot messages to Washington to come to them.\r\n\r\nThus hesitating and confused, Lee permitted Clinton to get his baggage\r\nand train to the front, and to mass all his best troops in the rear\r\nunder Cornwallis, who then advanced against the American lines. Now\r\nthere were no orders at all, and the troops did not know what to do,\r\nor where to go. They stood still, then began to fall back, and then to\r\nretreat. A very little more and there would have been a rout. As it\r\nwas, Washington alone prevented disaster. His early reports from the\r\nfront from Dickinson's outlying party, and from Lee himself, were all\r\nfavorable. Then he heard the firing, and putting the main army in\r\nmotion, he rode rapidly forward. First he encountered a straggler, who\r\ntalked of defeat. He could not believe it, and the fellow was pushed\r\naside and silenced. Then came another and another, all with songs of\r\ndeath. Finally, officers and regiments began to come. No one knew why\r\nthey fled, or what had happened. As the ill tidings grew thicker,\r\nWashington spurred sharper and rode faster through the deep sand, and\r\nunder the blazing midsummer sun. At last he met Lee and the main body\r\nall in full retreat. He rode straight at Lee, savage with anger, not\r\npleasant to look at, one may guess, and asked fiercely and with a deep\r\noath, tradition says, what it all meant. Lee was no coward, and did\r\nnot usually lack for words. He was, too, a hardened man of the world,\r\nand, in the phrase of that day, impudent to boot. But then and there\r\nhe stammered and hesitated. The fierce question was repeated. Lee\r\ngathered himself and tried to excuse and palliate what had happened,\r\nbut although the brief words that followed are variously reported to\r\nus across the century, we know that Washington rebuked him in such a\r\nway, and with such passion, that all was over between them. Lee had\r\ncommitted the one unpardonable sin in the eyes of his commander. He\r\nhad failed to fight when the enemy was upon him. He had disobeyed\r\norders and retreated. It was the end of him. He went to the rear,\r\nthence to a court-martial, thence to dismissal and to a solitary life\r\nwith a well-founded suspicion of treason hanging about him. He was an\r\nintelligent, quick-witted, unstable man, much overrated because he\r\nwas an English officer among a colonial people. He was ever treated\r\nmagnanimously by Washington after the day of battle at Monmouth, but\r\nhe then disappeared from the latter's life.\r\n\r\nWhen Lee bowed before the storm and stepped aside, Washington was left\r\nto deal with the danger and confusion around him. Thus did he tell the\r\nstory afterwards to his brother: \"A retreat, however, was the fact, be\r\nthe causes what they may; and the disorder arising from it would have\r\nproved fatal to the army, had not that bountiful Providence, which has\r\nnever failed us in the hour of distress, enabled me to form a regiment\r\nor two (of those that were retreating) in the face of the enemy, and\r\nunder their fire; by which means a stand was made long enough (the\r\nplace through which the enemy were pressing being narrow) to form the\r\ntroops, that were advancing, upon an advantageous piece of ground in\r\nthe rear.\" We cannot add much to these simple and modest words, for\r\nthey tell the whole story. Having put Lee aside, Washington rallied\r\nthe broken troops, brought them into position, turned them back, and\r\nheld the enemy in check. It was not an easy feat, but it was done, and\r\nwhen Lee's division again fell back in good order the main army was in\r\nposition, and the action became general. The British were repulsed,\r\nand then Washington, taking the offensive, drove them back until he\r\noccupied the battlefield of the morning. Night came upon him still\r\nadvancing. He halted his army, lay down under a tree, his soldiers\r\nlying on their arms about him, and planned a fresh attack, to be made\r\nat daylight. But when the dawn came it was seen that the British had\r\ncrept off, and were far on their road. The heat prevented a rapid\r\npursuit, and Clinton got into New York. Between there and Philadelphia\r\nhe had lost at least two thousand men by desertions in addition to\r\nnearly five hundred who fell at Monmouth.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to pause a moment and compare this battle with the\r\nrout of Long Island, the surprise at the Brandywine, and the fatal\r\nunsteadiness at Germantown. Here, too, a check was received at the\r\noutset, owing to blundering which no one could have foreseen. The\r\ntroops, confused and without orders, began to retreat, but without\r\npanic or disorder. The moment Washington appeared they rallied,\r\nreturned to the field, showed perfect steadiness, and the victory\r\nwas won. Monmouth has never been one of the famous battles of the\r\nRevolution, and yet there is no other which can compare with it as an\r\nillustration of Washington's ability as a soldier. It was not so much\r\nthe way in which it was fought, although that was fine enough, that\r\nits importance lies as in the evidence which it gives of the way\r\nin which Washington, after a series of defeats, during a winter\r\nof terrible suffering and privation, had yet developed his ragged\r\nvolunteers into a well-disciplined and effective army. The battle was\r\na victory, but the existence and the quality of the army that won it\r\nwere a far greater triumph.\r\n\r\nThe dreary winter at Valley Forge had indeed borne fruit. With a\r\nslight numerical superiority Washington had fought the British in the\r\nopen field, and fairly defeated them. \"Clinton gained no advantage,\"\r\nsaid the great Frederic, \"except to reach New York with the wreck of\r\nhis army; America is probably lost for England.\" Another year had\r\npassed, and England had lost an army, and still held what she had\r\nbefore, the city of New York. Washington was in the field with a\r\nbetter army than ever, and an army flushed with a victory which had\r\nbeen achieved after difficulties and trials such as no one now can\r\nrightly picture or describe. The American Revolution was advancing,\r\nheld firm by the master-hand of its leader. Into it, during these days\r\nof struggle and of battle, a new element had come, and the next step\r\nis to see how Washington dealt with the fresh conditions upon which\r\nthe great conflict had entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ALLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1778, Congress ratified the treaties of commerce and\r\nalliance with France. On the 6th, Washington, waiting at Valley Forge\r\nfor the British to start from Philadelphia, caused his army, drawn out\r\non parade, to celebrate the great event with cheers and with salvos of\r\nartillery and musketry. The alliance deserved cheers and celebration,\r\nfor it marked a long step onward in the Revolution. It showed that\r\nAmerica had demonstrated to Europe that she could win independence,\r\nand it had been proved to the traditional enemy of England that\r\nthe time had come when it would be profitable to help the revolted\r\ncolonies. But the alliance brought troubles as well as blessings in\r\nits train. It induced a relaxation in popular energy, and carried\r\nwith it new and difficult problems for the commander-in-chief. The\r\nsuccessful management of allies, and of allied forces, had been one\r\nof the severest tests of the statesmanship of William III., and had\r\nconstituted one of the principal glories of Marlborough. A similar\r\nproblem now confronted the American general.\r\n\r\nWashington was free from the diplomatic and political portion of the\r\nbusiness, but the military and popular part fell wholly into his\r\nhands, and demanded the exercise of talents entirely different from\r\nthose of either a general or an administrator. It has been not\r\ninfrequently written more or less plainly, and it is constantly said,\r\nthat Washington was great in character, but that in brains he was\r\nnot far above the common-place. It is even hinted sometimes that the\r\nfather of his country was a dull man, a notion which we shall have\r\noccasion to examine more fully further on. At this point let the\r\ncriticism be remembered merely in connection with the fact that\r\nto coöperate with allies in military matters demands tact, quick\r\nperception, firmness, and patience. In a word, it is a task which\r\ncalls for the finest and most highly trained intellectual powers, and\r\nof which the difficulty is enhanced a thousandfold when the allies are\r\non the one side, an old, aristocratic, punctilious people, and on the\r\nother, colonists utterly devoid of tradition, etiquette, or fixed\r\nhabits, and very much accustomed to go their own way and speak their\r\nown minds with careless freedom. With this problem Washington was\r\nobliged suddenly to deal, both in ill success and good success, as\r\nwell as in many attempts which came to nothing. Let us see how he\r\nsolved it at the very outset, when everything went most perversely\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 he heard that D'Estaing's fleet was off the coast, and at\r\nonce, without a trace of elation or excitement, he began to consider\r\nthe possibility of intercepting the British fleet expected to arrive\r\nshortly from Cork. As soon as D'Estaing was within reach he sent\r\ntwo of his aides on board the flagship, and at once opened a\r\ncorrespondence with his ally. These letters of welcome, and those of\r\nsuggestion which followed, are models, in their way, of what such\r\nletters ought always to be. They were perfectly adapted to satisfy the\r\netiquette and the love of good manners of the French, and yet there\r\nwas not a trace of anything like servility, or of an effusive\r\ngratitude which outran the favors granted. They combined stately\r\ncourtesy with simple dignity, and are phrased with a sober grace which\r\nshows the thoroughly strong man, as capable to turn a sentence, if\r\nneed be, as to rally retreating soldiers in the face of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn this first meeting of the allies nothing happened fortunately.\r\nD'Estaing had had a long passage, and was too late to cut off Lord\r\nHowe at the Delaware. Then he turned to New York, and was too late\r\nthere, and found further that he could not get his ships over the bar.\r\nHence more delays, so that he was late again in getting to Newport,\r\nwhere he was to unite with Sullivan in driving the British from Rhode\r\nIsland, as Washington had planned, in case of failure at New York,\r\nwhile the French were still hovering on the coast. When D'Estaing\r\nfinally reached Newport, there was still another delay of ten days,\r\nand then, just as he and Sullivan were preparing to attack, Lord Howe,\r\nwith his squadron reinforced, appeared off the harbor. Promising to\r\nreturn, D'Estaing sailed out to give the enemy battle, and after\r\nmuch manoeuvring both fleets were driven off by a severe storm, and\r\nD'Estaing came back only to tell Sullivan that he must go to Boston at\r\nonce to refit. Then came the protest addressed to the Count and signed\r\nby all the American officers; then the departure of D'Estaing, and an\r\nindiscreet proclamation to the troops by Sullivan, reflecting on the\r\nconduct of the allies.\r\n\r\nWhen D'Estaing had actually gone, and the Americans were obliged to\r\nretreat, there was much grumbling in all directions, and it looked as\r\nif the first result of the alliance was to be a very pretty quarrel.\r\nIt was a bad and awkward business. Congress had the good sense to\r\nsuppress the protest of the officers, and Washington, disappointed,\r\nbut perhaps not wholly surprised, set himself to work to put matters\r\nright. It was no easy task to soothe the French, on the one hand, who\r\nwere naturally aggrieved at the utterances of the American officers\r\nand at the popular feeling, and on the other to calm his own people,\r\nwho were, not without reason, both disappointed and provoked. To\r\nSullivan, fuming with wrath, he wrote: \"Should the expedition fail\r\nthrough the abandonment of the French fleet, the officers concerned\r\nwill be apt to complain loudly. But prudence dictates that we should\r\nput the best face upon the matter, and to the world attribute the\r\nremoval to Boston to necessity. The reasons are too obvious to need\r\nexplaining.\" And again, a few days later: \"First impressions, you\r\nknow, are generally longest remembered, and will serve to fix in a\r\ngreat degree our national character among the French. In our conduct\r\ntowards them we should remember that they are a people old in war,\r\nvery strict in military etiquette, and apt to take fire when others\r\nscarcely seem warmed. Permit me to recommend, in the most particular\r\nmanner, the cultivation of harmony and good agreement, and your\r\nendeavor to destroy that ill-humor which may have got into officers.\"\r\nTo Lafayette he wrote: \"Everybody, sir, who reasons, will acknowledge\r\nthe advantages which we have derived from the French fleet, and the\r\nzeal of the commander of it; but in a free and republican government\r\nyou cannot restrain the voice of the multitude. Every man will speak\r\nas he thinks, or, more properly, without thinking, and consequently\r\nwill judge of effects without attending to the causes. The censures\r\nwhich have been leveled at the French fleet would more than probably\r\nhave fallen in a much higher degree upon a fleet of our own, if we\r\nhad had one in the same situation. It is the nature of man to be\r\ndispleased with everything that disappoints a favorite hope or\r\nflattering project; and it is the folly of too many of them to condemn\r\nwithout investigating circumstances.\" Finally he wrote to D'Estaing,\r\ndeploring the difference which had arisen, mentioning his own efforts\r\nand wishes to restore harmony, and said: \"It is in the trying\r\ncircumstances to which your Excellency has been exposed that the\r\nvirtues of a great mind are displayed in their brightest lustre, and\r\nthat a general's character is better known than in the moment of\r\nvictory. It was yours by every title that can give it; and the adverse\r\nelements that robbed you of your prize can never deprive you of\r\nthe glory due you. Though your success has not been equal to your\r\nexpectations, yet you have the satisfaction of reflecting that you\r\nhave rendered essential services to the common cause.\" This is not the\r\nletter of a dull man. Indeed, there is a nicety about it that partakes\r\nof cleverness, a much commoner thing than greatness, but something\r\nwhich all great men by no means possess. Thus by tact and\r\ncomprehension of human nature, by judicious suppression and equally\r\njudicious letters, Washington, through the prudent exercise of all his\r\ncommanding influence, quieted his own people and soothed his allies.\r\nIn this way a serious disaster was averted, and an abortive expedition\r\nwas all that was left to be regretted, instead of an ugly quarrel,\r\nwhich might readily have neutralized the vast advantages flowing from\r\nthe French alliance. Having refitted, D'Estaing bore away for the West\r\nIndies, and so closed the first chapter in the history of the alliance\r\nwith France. Nothing more was heard of the allies until the spring was\r\nwell advanced, when M. Gerard, the minister, wrote, intimating that\r\nD'Estaing was about to return, and asking what we would do. Washington\r\nreplied at length, professing his willingness to coöperate in any way,\r\nand offering, if the French would send ships, to abandon everything,\r\nrun all risks, and make an attack on New York. Nothing further came\r\nof it, and Washington heard that the fleet had gone to the Southern\r\nStates, which he learned without regret, as he was apprehensive as to\r\nthe condition of affairs in that region. Again, in the autumn, it\r\nwas reported that the fleet was once more upon the northern coast.\r\nWashington at once sent officers to be on the lookout at the most\r\nlikely points, and he wrote elaborately to D'Estaing, setting forth\r\nwith wonderful perspicuity the incidents of the past, the condition of\r\nthe present, and the probabilities of the future. He was willing to do\r\nanything, or plan anything, provided his allies would join with him.\r\nThe jealousy so habitual in humanity, which is afraid that some one\r\nelse may get the glory of a common success, was unknown to Washington,\r\nand if he could but drive the British from America, and establish\r\nAmerican independence, he was perfectly willing that the glory should\r\ntake care of itself. But all his wisdom in dealing with the allies\r\nwas, for the moment, vain. While he was planning for a great stroke,\r\nand calling out the militia of New England, D'Estaing was making ready\r\nto relieve Georgia, and a few days after Washington wrote his second\r\nletter, the French and Americans assaulted the British works at\r\nSavannah, and were repulsed with heavy losses. Then D'Estaing sailed\r\naway again, and the second effort of France to aid England's revolted\r\ncolonies came to an end. Their presence had had a good moral effect,\r\nand the dread of D'Estaing's return had caused Clinton to withdraw\r\nfrom Newport and concentrate in New York. This was all that was\r\nactually accomplished, and there was nothing for it but to await still\r\nanother trial and a more convenient season.\r\n\r\nWith all his courtesy and consideration, with all his readiness to\r\nfall in with the wishes and schemes of the French, it must not be\r\nsupposed that Washington ever went an inch too far in this direction.\r\nHe valued the French alliance, and proposed to use it to great\r\npurpose, but he was not in the least dazzled or blinded by it. Even\r\nin the earliest glow of excitement and hope produced by D'Estaing's\r\narrival, Washington took occasion to draw once more the distinction\r\nbetween a valuable alliance and volunteer adventurers, and to\r\nremonstrate again with Congress about their reckless profusion in\r\ndealing with foreign officers. To Gouverneur Morris he wrote on July\r\n24, 1778: \"The lavish manner in which rank has hitherto been bestowed\r\non these gentlemen will certainly be productive of one or the other of\r\nthese two evils: either to make it despicable in the eyes of Europe,\r\nor become the means of pouring them in upon us like a torrent and\r\nadding to our present burden. But it is neither the expense nor the\r\ntrouble of them that I most dread. There is an evil more extensive in\r\nits nature, and fatal in its consequences, to be apprehended, and\r\nthat is the driving of all our own officers out of the service, and\r\nthrowing not only our army, but our military councils, entirely into\r\nthe hands of foreigners.... Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting\r\nto quit his inspectorship for a command in the line. This will be\r\nproductive of much discontent to the brigadiers. In a word, although I\r\nthink the baron an excellent officer, I do most devoutly wish that we\r\nhad not a single foreigner among us except the Marquis de Lafayette,\r\nwho acts upon very different principles from those which govern the\r\nrest.\" A few days later he said, on the same theme, to the president\r\nof Congress: \"I trust you think me so much a citizen of the world as\r\nto believe I am not easily warped or led away by attachments merely\r\nlocal and American; yet I confess I am not entirely without them, nor\r\ndoes it appear to me that they are unwarrantable, if confined within\r\nproper limits. Fewer promotions in the foreign line would have been\r\nproductive of more harmony, and made our warfare more agreeable to all\r\nparties.\" Again, he said of Steuben: \"I regret that there should be a\r\nnecessity that his services should be lost to the army; at the same\r\ntime I think it my duty explicitly to observe to Congress that his\r\ndesire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be\r\ncomplied with without wounding the feelings of a number of officers,\r\nwhose rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the\r\ndoing of it would be productive of much dissatisfaction and extensive\r\nill consequences.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's resistance to the colonial deference for foreigners has\r\nalready been pointed out, but this second burst of opposition, coming\r\nat this especial time, deserves renewed attention. The splendid fleet\r\nand well-equipped troops of our ally were actually at our gates, and\r\neverybody was in a paroxysm of perfectly natural gratitude. To the\r\ncolonial mind, steeped in colonial habits of thought, the foreigner at\r\nthis particular juncture appeared more than ever to be a splendid and\r\nsuperior being. But he did not in the least confuse or sway the cool\r\njudgment that guided the destinies of the Revolution. Let us consider\r\nwell the pregnant sentences just quoted, and the letters from which\r\nthey are taken. They deserve it, for they throw a strong light on a\r\nside of Washington's mind and character too little appreciated. One\r\nhears it said not infrequently, it has been argued even in print with\r\nsome solemnity, that Washington was, no doubt, a great man and rightly\r\na national hero, but that he was not an American. It will be necessary\r\nto recur to this charge again and consider it at some length. It is\r\nsufficient at this point to see how it tallies with his conduct in\r\na single matter, which was a very perfect test of the national and\r\nAmerican quality of the man. We can get at the truth by contrasting\r\nhim with his own contemporaries, the only fair comparison, for he was\r\na man and an American of his own time and not of the present day,\r\nwhich is a point his critics overlook.\r\n\r\nWhere he differed from the men of his own time was in the fact that he\r\nrose to a breadth and height of Americanism and of national feeling\r\nwhich no other man of that day touched at all. Nothing is more intense\r\nthan the conservatism of mental habits, and although it requires now\r\nan effort to realize it, it should not be forgotten that in every\r\nhabit of thought the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies were wholly\r\ncolonial. If this is properly appreciated we can understand the mental\r\nbreadth and vigor which enabled Washington to shake off at once all\r\npast habits and become an independent leader of an independent\r\npeople. He felt to the very core of his being the need of national\r\nself-respect and national dignity. To him, as the chief of the armies\r\nand the head of the Revolution, all men, no matter what tongue they\r\nspake or what country they came from, were to be dealt with on a\r\nfooting of simple equality, and treated according to their merits.\r\nThere was to him no glamour in the fact that this man was a Frenchman\r\nand that an Englishman. His own personal pride extended to his people,\r\nand he bowed to no national superiority anywhere. Hamilton was\r\nnational throughout, but he was born outside the thirteen colonies,\r\nand knew his fellow-citizens only as Americans. Franklin was national\r\nby the force of his own commanding genius. John Adams grew to the same\r\nconception, so far as our relations to other nations were concerned.\r\nBut beyond these three we may look far and closely before we find\r\nanother among all the really great men of the time who freed himself\r\nwholly from the superstition of the colonist about the nations of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington drew his sword beneath the Cambridge elm he stood\r\nforth as the first American, the best type of man that the New World\r\ncould produce, with no provincial taint upon him, and no shadow of the\r\ncolonial past clouding his path. It was this great quality that gave\r\nthe struggle which he led a character it would never have attained\r\nwithout a leader so constituted. Had he been merely a colonial\r\nEnglishman, had he not risen at once to the conception of an American\r\nnation, the world would have looked at us with very different eyes.\r\nIt was the personal dignity of the man, quite as much as his fighting\r\ncapacity, which impressed Europe. Kings and ministers, looking on\r\ndispassionately, soon realized that here was no ordinary agitator\r\nor revolutionist, but a great man on a great stage with great\r\nconceptions. England, indeed, talked about a militia colonel, but this\r\nchatter disappeared in the smoke of Trenton, and even England came to\r\nlook upon him as the all-powerful spirit of the Revolution. Dull men\r\nand colonial squires do not grasp a great idea and carry it into\r\naction on the world's stage in a few months. To stand forward at the\r\nhead of raw armies and of a colonial people as a national leader,\r\ncalm, dignified, and far-seeing, requires not only character, but\r\nintellect of the highest and strongest kind. Now that we have come\r\nas a people, after more than a century's struggle, to the national\r\nfeeling which Washington compassed in a moment, it is well to consider\r\nthat single achievement and to meditate on its meaning, whether in\r\nestimating him, or in gauging what he was to the American people when\r\nthey came into existence.\r\n\r\nLet us take another instance of the same quality, shown also in the\r\nwinter of 1778. Congress had from the beginning a longing to conquer\r\nCanada, which was a wholly natural and entirely laudable desire, for\r\nconquest is always more interesting than defense. Washington, on the\r\nother hand, after the first complete failure, which was so nearly\r\na success in the then undefended and unsuspicious country, gave up\r\npretty thoroughly all ideas of attacking Canada again, and opposed\r\nthe various plans of Congress in that direction. When he had a\r\nlife-and-death struggle to get together and subsist enough men\r\nto protect their own firesides, he had ample reason to know that\r\ninvasions of Canada were hopeless. Indeed, not much active opposition\r\nfrom the commander-in-chief was needed to dispose of the Canadian\r\nschemes, for facts settled them as fast as they arose. When the\r\ncabal got up its Canadian expedition, it consisted of Lafayette, and\r\npenetrated no farther than Albany. So Washington merely kept his eye\r\nwatchfully on Canada, and argued against expeditions thither, until\r\nthis winter of 1778, when something quite new in that direction came\r\nup.\r\n\r\nLafayette's imagination had been fired by the notion of conquering\r\nCanada. His idea was to get succors from France for this especial\r\npurpose, and with them and American aid to achieve the conquest.\r\nCongress was impressed and pleased by the scheme, and sent a report\r\nupon it to Franklin, to communicate to the French court, but\r\nWashington, when he heard of the plan, took a very different view.\r\nHe sent at once a long dispatch to Congress, urging every possible\r\nobjection to the proposed campaign, on the ground of its utter\r\nimpracticability, and with this official letter, which was necessarily\r\nconfined to the military side of the question, went another addressed\r\nto President Laurens personally, which contained the deeper reasons of\r\nhis opposition. He said that there was an objection not touched upon\r\nin his public letter, which was absolutely insurmountable. This was\r\nthe introduction of French troops into Canada to take possession of\r\nthe capital, in the midst of a people of their own race and religion,\r\nand but recently severed from them.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out the enormous advantages which would accrue to France\r\nfrom the possession of Canada, such as independent posts, control of\r\nthe Indians, and the Newfoundland trade. \"France, ... possessed of New\r\nOrleans on our right, Canada on our left, and seconded by the\r\nnumerous tribes of Indians in our rear, ... would, it is much to be\r\napprehended, have it in her power to give law to these States.\" He\r\nwent on to show that France might easily find an excuse for such\r\nconduct, in seeking a surety for her advances of money, and that she\r\nhad but little to fear from the contingency of our being driven to\r\nreunite with England. He continued: \"Men are very apt to run into\r\nextremes. Hatred to England may carry some into an excess of\r\nconfidence in France, especially when motives of gratitude are thrown\r\ninto the scale. Men of this description would be unwilling to suppose\r\nFrance capable of acting so ungenerous a part. I am heartily disposed\r\nto entertain the most favorable sentiments of our new ally, and to\r\ncherish them in others to a reasonable degree. But it is a maxim,\r\nfounded on the universal experience of mankind, that no nation is\r\nto be trusted farther than it is bound by its own interest; and no\r\nprudent statesman or politician will venture to depart from it. In our\r\ncircumstances we ought to be particularly cautious; for we have not\r\nyet attained sufficient vigor and maturity to recover from the shock\r\nof any false steps into which we may unwarily fall.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to recall these utterances at a later day, but\r\nat this time they serve to show yet again how broadly and clearly\r\nWashington judged nations and policies. Uppermost in his mind was the\r\ndestiny of his own nation, just coming into being, and from that firm\r\npoint he watched and reasoned. His words had no effect on Congress,\r\nbut as it turned out, the plan failed through adverse influences in\r\nthe quarter where Washington least expected them. He believed that\r\nthis Canadian plan had been put into Lafayette's mind by the cabinet\r\nof Louis XVI., and he could not imagine that a policy of such obvious\r\nwisdom could be overlooked by French statesmen. In this he was\r\ncompletely mistaken, for France failed to see what seemed so simple to\r\nthe American general, that the opportunity had come to revive her old\r\nAmerican policy and reestablish her colonies under the most favorable\r\nconditions. The ministers of Louis XVI., moreover, did not wish the\r\ncolonies to conquer Canada, and the plan of Lafayette and the Congress\r\nreceived no aid in Paris and came to nothing. But the fruitless\r\nincident exhibits in the strongest light the attitude of Washington as\r\na purely American statesman, and the comprehensiveness of his mind in\r\ndealing with large affairs.\r\n\r\nThe French alliance and the coming of the French fleet were of\r\nincalculable advantage to the colonies, but they had one evil effect,\r\nas has already been suggested. To a people weary with unequal\r\nconflict, it was a debilitating influence, and America needed at that\r\nmoment more than ever energy and vigor, both in the council and\r\nthe field. Yet the general outlook was distinctly better and more\r\nencouraging. Soon after Washington had defeated Clinton at Monmouth,\r\nand had taken a position whence he could watch and check him, he wrote\r\nto his friend General Nelson in Virginia:--\r\n\r\n\"It is not a little pleasing, nor less wonderful to contemplate, that,\r\nafter two years' manoeuvring and undergoing the strangest vicissitudes\r\nthat perhaps ever attended any one contest since the creation, both\r\narmies are brought back to the very point they set out from, and that\r\nthe offending party at the beginning is now reduced to the spade and\r\npickaxe for defense. The hand of Providence has been so conspicuous in\r\nall this that he must be worse than an infidel that lacks faith, and\r\nmore than wicked that has not gratitude enough to acknowledge his\r\nobligations. But it will be time enough for me to turn preacher when\r\nmy present appointment ceases.\"\r\n\r\nHe had reason to congratulate himself on the result of his two years'\r\ncampaigning, but as the summer wore away and winter came on he found\r\ncauses for fresh and deep alarm, despite the good outlook in the\r\nfield. The demoralizing effects of civil war were beginning to show\r\nthemselves in various directions. The character of Congress, in point\r\nof ability, had declined alarmingly, for the ablest men of the first\r\nCongress, with few exceptions, had departed. Some had gone to the\r\narmy, some to the diplomatic service, and many had remained at home,\r\npreferring the honors and offices of the States to those of the\r\nConfederation. Their successors, patriotic and well-meaning though\r\nthey were, lacked the energy and force of those who had started the\r\nRevolution, and, as a consequence, Congress had become feeble and\r\nineffective, easily swayed by influential schemers, and unable to cope\r\nwith the difficulties which surrounded them.\r\n\r\nOutside the government the popular tone had deteriorated sadly. The\r\nlavish issues of irredeemable paper by the Confederation and the\r\nStates had brought their finances to the verge of absolute ruin. The\r\ncontinental currency had fallen to something like forty to one in\r\ngold, and the decline was hastened by the forged notes put out by the\r\nenemy. The fluctuations of this paper soon bred a spirit of gambling,\r\nand hence came a class of men, both inside and outside of politics,\r\nwho sought, more or less corruptly, to make fortunes by army\r\ncontracts, and by forestalling the markets. These developments filled\r\nWashington with anxiety, for in the financial troubles he saw ruin\r\nto the army. The unpaid troops bore the injustice done them with\r\nwonderful patience, but it was something that could not last, and\r\nWashington knew the danger. In vain did he remonstrate. It seemed to\r\nbe impossible to get anything done, and at last, in the following\r\nspring, the outbreak began. Two New Jersey regiments refused to march\r\nuntil the assembly made provision for their pay. Washington took high\r\nground with them, but they stood respectfully firm, and finally had\r\ntheir way. Not long after came another outbreak in the Connecticut\r\nline, with similar results. These object lessons had some result, and\r\nby foreign loans and the ability of Robert Morris the country was\r\nenabled to stumble along; but it was a frightful and wearing anxiety\r\nto the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nWashington saw at once that the root of the evil lay in the feebleness\r\nof Congress, and although he could not deal with the finances, he was\r\nable to strive for an improvement in the governing body. Not content\r\nwith letters, he left the army and went to Philadelphia, in the winter\r\nof 1779, and there appealed to Congress in person, setting forth the\r\nperils which beset them, and urging action. He wrote also to his\r\nfriends everywhere, pointing out the deficiencies of Congress, and\r\nbegging them to send better and stronger men. To Benjamin Harrison he\r\nwrote: \"It appears to me as clear as ever the sun did in its meridian\r\nbrightness, that America never stood in more eminent need of the wise,\r\npatriotic, and spirited exertions of her sons than at this period; ...\r\nthe States separately are too much engaged in their local concerns,\r\nand have too many of their ablest men withdrawn from the general\r\ncouncil, for the good of the common weal.\" He took the same high tone\r\nin all his letters, and there can be seen through it all the desperate\r\nendeavor to make the States and the people understand the dangers\r\nwhich he realized, but which they either could not or would not\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while his anxiety was sharpened to the highest\r\npoint by the character of Congress, his sternest wrath was kindled by\r\nthe gambling and money-making which had become rampant. To Reed he\r\nwrote in December, 1778: \"It gives me sincere pleasure to find that\r\nthere is likely to be a coalition of the Whigs in your State, a few\r\nonly excepted, and that the assembly is so well disposed to second\r\nyour endeavors in bringing those murderers of our cause, the\r\nmonopolizers, forestallers, and engrossers, to condign punishment. It\r\nis much to be lamented that each State, long ere this, has not hunted\r\nthem down as pests to society and the greatest enemies we have to\r\nthe happiness of America. I would to God that some one of the most\r\natrocious in each State was hung in gibbets upon a gallows five times\r\nas high as the one prepared by Haman. No punishment, in my opinion, is\r\ntoo great for the man who can build his greatness upon his country's\r\nruin.\" He would have hanged them too had he had the power, for he was\r\nalways as good as his word.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to read these righteously angry words, still ringing\r\nas sharply as when they were written. They clear away all the\r\nmyths--the priggish, the cold, the statuesque, the dull myths--as the\r\nstrong gusts of the northwest wind in autumn sweep off the heavy mists\r\nof lingering August. They are the hot words of a warm-blooded man, a\r\ngood hater, who loathed meanness and treachery, and who would have\r\nhanged those who battened upon the country's distress. When he went\r\nto Philadelphia, a few weeks later, and saw the state of things with\r\nnearer view, he felt the wretchedness and outrage of such doings more\r\nthan ever. He wrote to Harrison: \"If I were to be called upon to draw\r\na picture of the times and of men, from what I have seen, heard, and\r\nin part know, I should in one word say, that idleness, dissipation,\r\nand extravagance seem to have laid fast hold of most of them; that\r\nspeculation, peculation, and an insatiable thirst for riches seem to\r\nhave got the better of every other consideration, and almost of every\r\norder of men; that party disputes and personal quarrels are the great\r\nbusiness of the day; whilst the momentous concerns of an empire, a\r\ngreat and accumulating debt, ruined finances, depreciated money, and\r\nwant of credit, which, in its consequences, is the want of everything,\r\nare but secondary considerations, and postponed from day to day, from\r\nweek to week, as if our affairs wore the most promising aspect.\"\r\n\r\nOther men talked about empire, but he alone grasped the great\r\nconception, and felt it in his soul. To see not only immediate success\r\nimperiled, but the future paltered with by small, mean, and dishonest\r\nmen, cut him to the quick. He set himself doggedly to fight it, as he\r\nalways fought every enemy, using both speech and pen in all quarters.\r\nMuch, no doubt, he ultimately effected, but he was contending with\r\nthe usual results of civil war, which are demoralizing always, and\r\nespecially so among a young people in a new country. At first,\r\ntherefore, all seemed vain. The selfishness, \"peculation, and\r\nspeculation\" seemed to get worse, and the tone of Congress and the\r\npeople lower, as he struggled against them. In March, 1779, he wrote\r\nto James Warren of Massachusetts: \"Nothing, I am convinced, but\r\nthe depreciation of our currency, aided by stock-jobbing and party\r\ndissensions, has fed the hopes of the enemy, and kept the British\r\narms in America to this day. They do not scruple to declare this\r\nthemselves, and add that we shall be our own conquerors. Can not our\r\ncommon country, America, possess virtue enough to disappoint them? Is\r\nthe paltry consideration of a little pelf to individuals to be placed\r\nin competition with the essential rights and liberties of the present\r\ngeneration, and of millions yet unborn? Shall a few designing men, for\r\ntheir own aggrandizement, and to gratify their own avarice, overset\r\nthe goodly fabric we have been rearing, at the expense of so much\r\ntime, blood, and treasure? And shall we at last become the victims\r\nof our own lust of gain? Forbid it, Heaven! Forbid it, all and every\r\nState in the Union, by enacting and enforcing efficacious laws for\r\nchecking the growth of these monstrous evils, and restoring matters,\r\nin some degree, to the state they were in at the commencement of the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our cause is noble. It is the cause of mankind, and the danger to it\r\nis to be apprehended from ourselves. Shall we slumber and sleep, then,\r\nwhile we should be punishing those miscreants who have brought these\r\ntroubles upon us, and who are aiming to continue us in them; while we\r\nshould be striving to fill our battalions, and devising ways and means\r\nto raise the value of the currency, on the credit of which everything\r\ndepends?\" Again we see the prevailing idea of the future, which\r\nhaunted him continually. Evidently, he had some imagination, and\r\nalso a power of terse and eloquent expression which we have heard of\r\nbefore, and shall note again.\r\n\r\nStill the appeals seemed to sound in deaf ears. He wrote to George\r\nMason: \"I have seen, without despondency, even for a moment, the hours\r\nwhich America has styled her gloomy ones; but I have beheld no\r\nday since the commencement of hostilities that I have thought her\r\nliberties in such imminent danger as at present.... Indeed, we are\r\nverging so fast to destruction that I am filled with sensations to\r\nwhich I have been a stranger till within these three months.\" To\r\nGouverneur Morris he said: \"If the enemy have it in their power to\r\npress us hard this campaign, I know not what may be the consequence.\"\r\nHe had faced the enemy, the bleak winters, raw soldiers, and all the\r\ndifficulties of impecunious government, with a cheerful courage that\r\nnever failed. But the spectacle of widespread popular demoralization,\r\nof selfish scrambles for plunder, and of feeble administration at\r\nthe centre of government weighed upon him heavily. It was not the\r\ngeneral's business to build up Congress and grapple with finance, but\r\nWashington addressed himself to the new task with his usual persistent\r\ncourage. It was slow and painful work. He seemed to make no progress,\r\nand then it was that his spirits sank at the prospect of ruin and\r\ndefeat, not coming on the field of battle, but from our own vices and\r\nour own lack of energy and wisdom. Yet his work told in the end, as it\r\nalways did. His vast and steadily growing influence made itself felt\r\neven through the dense troubles of the uneasy times. Congress turned\r\nwith energy to Europe for fresh loans. Lafayette worked away to get\r\nan army sent over. The two Morrises, stimulated by Washington, flung\r\nthemselves into the financial difficulties, and feeble but distinct\r\nefforts toward a more concentrated and better organized administration\r\nof public affairs were made both in the States and the confederation.\r\n\r\nBut, although Washington's spirits fell, and his anxieties became\r\nwellnigh intolerable in this period of reaction which followed the\r\nFrench alliance, he made no public show of it, but carried on his own\r\nwork with the army and in the field as usual, contending with all the\r\ndifficulties, new and old, as calmly and efficiently as ever. After\r\nClinton slipped away from Monmouth and sought refuge in New York,\r\nWashington took post at convenient points and watched the movements\r\nof the enemy. In this way the summer passed. As always, Washington's\r\nfirst object was to guard the Hudson, and while he held this vital\r\npoint firmly, he waited, ready to strike elsewhere if necessary. It\r\nlooked for a time as if the British intended to descend on Boston,\r\nseize the town, and destroy the French fleet, which had gone there\r\nto refit. Such was the opinion of Gates, then commanding in that\r\ndepartment, and as Washington inclined to the same belief, the fear of\r\nthis event gave him many anxious moments. He even moved his troops\r\nso as to be in readiness to march eastward at short notice; but he\r\ngradually became convinced that the enemy had no such plan. Much\r\nof his thought, now and always, was given to efforts to divine the\r\nintentions of the British generals. They had so few settled ideas,\r\nand were so tardy and lingering when they had plans, that it is small\r\nwonder that their opponents were sorely puzzled in trying to find out\r\nwhat their purposes were, when they really had none. The fact was that\r\nWashington saw their military opportunities with the eye of a great\r\nsoldier, and so much better than they, that he suffered a good deal of\r\nneedless anxiety in devising methods to meet attacks which they had\r\nnot the wit to undertake. He had a profound contempt for their policy\r\nof holding towns, and believing that they must see the utter futility\r\nof it, after several years of trial, he constantly expected from them\r\na well-planned and extensive campaign, which in reality they were\r\nincapable of devising.\r\n\r\nThe main army, therefore, remained quiet, and when the autumn had\r\npassed went into winter-quarters in well-posted detachments about New\r\nYork. In December Clinton made an ineffectual raid, and then all was\r\npeaceful again, and Washington was able to go to Philadelphia and\r\nstruggle with Congress, leaving his army more comfortable and secure\r\nthan they had been in any previous winter.\r\n\r\nIn January he informed Congress as to the next campaign. He showed\r\nthem the impossibility of undertaking anything on a large scale, and\r\nannounced his intention of remaining on the defensive. It was a trying\r\npolicy to a man of his temper, but he could do no better, and he knew,\r\nnow as always, what others could not yet see, that by simply holding\r\non and keeping his army in the field he was slowly but surely winning\r\nindependence. He tried to get Congress to do something with the navy,\r\nand he planned an expedition, under the command of Sullivan, to\r\noverrun the Indian country and check the barbarous raids of the Tories\r\nand savages on the frontier; and with this he was fain to be content.\r\nIn fact, he perceived very clearly the direction in which the war was\r\ntending. He kept up his struggle with Congress for a permanent army,\r\nand with the old persistency pleaded that something should be done for\r\nthe officers, and at the same time he tried to keep the States in good\r\nhumor when they were grumbling about the amount of protection afforded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut all this wear and tear of heart and brain and temper, while given\r\nchiefly to hold the army together, was not endured with any\r\nnotion that he and Clinton were eventually to fight it out in the\r\nneighborhood of New York. Washington felt that that part of the\r\nconflict was over. He now hoped and believed that the moment would\r\ncome, when, by uniting his army with the French, he should be able to\r\nstrike the decisive blow. Until that time came, however, he knew that\r\nhe could do nothing on a great scale, and he felt that meanwhile the\r\nBritish, abandoning practically the eastern and middle States, would\r\nmake one last desperate struggle for victory, and would make it in the\r\nsouth. Long before any one else, he appreciated this fact, and saw a\r\nperil looming large in that region, where everybody was considering\r\nthe British invasion as little more than an exaggerated raid. He\r\nforesaw, too, that we should suffer more there than we had in the\r\nextreme north, because the south was full of Tories and less well\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, did not change his own plans one jot. He believed\r\nthat the south must work out its own salvation, as New York and New\r\nEngland had done with Burgoyne, and he felt sure that in the end it\r\nwould be successful. But he would not go south, nor take his army\r\nthere. The instinct of a great commander for the vital point in a war\r\nor a battle, is as keen as that of the tiger is said to be for the\r\njugular vein of its victim. The British might overrun the north or\r\ninvade the south, but he would stay where he was, with his grip upon\r\nNew York and the Hudson River. The tide of invasion might ebb and flow\r\nin this region or that, but the British were doomed if they could not\r\ndivide the eastern colonies from the others. When the appointed hour\r\ncame, he was ready to abandon everything and strike the final and\r\nfatal blow; but until then he waited and stood fast with his army,\r\nholding the great river in his grasp. He felt much more anxiety about\r\nthe south than he had felt about the north, and expected Congress to\r\nconsult him as to a commander, having made up his mind that Greene was\r\nthe man to send. But Congress still believed in Gates, who had been\r\nmaking trouble for Washington all winter; and so Gates was sent,\r\nand Congress in due time got their lesson, and found once more that\r\nWashington understood men better than they did.\r\n\r\nIn the north the winter was comparatively uneventful. The spring\r\npassed, and in June Clinton came out and took possession of Stony\r\nPoint and Verplanck's Point, and began to fortify them. It looked a\r\nlittle as if Clinton might intend to get control of the Hudson by\r\nslow approaches, fortifying, and then advancing until he reached West\r\nPoint. With this in mind, Washington at once determined to check the\r\nBritish by striking sharply at one of their new posts. Having made\r\nup his mind, he sent for Wayne and asked him if he would storm Stony\r\nPoint. Tradition says that Wayne replied, \"I will storm hell, if you\r\nwill plan it.\" A true tradition, probably, in keeping with Wayne's\r\ncharacter, and pleasant to us to-day as showing with a vivid gleam of\r\nrough human speech the utter confidence of the army in their leader,\r\nthat confidence which only a great soldier can inspire. So Washington\r\nplanned, and Wayne stormed, and Stony Point fell. It was a gallant and\r\nbrilliant feat of arms, one of the most brilliant of the war. Over\r\nfive hundred prisoners were taken, the guns were carried off, and the\r\nworks destroyed, leaving the British to begin afresh with a good deal\r\nof increased caution and respect. Not long after, Harry Lee stormed\r\nPaulus Hook with equal success, and the British were checked and\r\narrested, if they intended any extensive movement. On the frontier,\r\nSullivan, after some delays, did his work effectively, ravaging the\r\nIndian towns and reducing them to quiet, thus taking away another\r\nannoyance and danger.\r\n\r\nIn these various ways Clinton's circle of activity was steadily\r\nnarrowed, but it may be doubted whether he had any coherent plan.\r\nThe principal occupation of the British was to send out marauding\r\nexpeditions and cut off outlying parties. Tryon burned and pillaged\r\nin Connecticut, Matthews in Virginia, and others on a smaller scale\r\nelsewhere in New Jersey and New York. The blundering stupidity of this\r\nsystem of warfare was only equaled by its utter brutality. Houses were\r\nburned, peaceful villages went up in smoke, women and children were\r\noutraged, and soldiers were bayoneted after they had surrendered.\r\nThese details of the Revolution are wellnigh forgotten now, but when\r\nthe ear is wearied with talk about English generosity and love of fair\r\nplay, it is well to turn back and study the exploits of Tryon, and it\r\nis not amiss in the same connection to recall that English budgets\r\ncontained a special appropriation for scalping-knives, a delicate\r\nattention to the Tories and Indians who were burning and butchering on\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nSuch methods of warfare Washington despised intellectually, and hated\r\nmorally. He saw that every raid only hardened the people against\r\nEngland, and made her cause more hopeless. The misery caused by these\r\nraids angered him, but he would not retaliate in kind, and Wayne\r\nbayoneted no English soldiers after they laid down their arms at Stony\r\nPoint. It was enough for Washington to hold fast to the great objects\r\nhe had in view, to check Clinton and circumscribe his movements.\r\nSteadfastly he did this through the summer and winter of 1779, which\r\nproved one of the worst that he had yet endured. Supplies did not\r\ncome, the army dwindled, and the miseries of Valley Forge were\r\nrenewed. Again was repeated the old and pitiful story of appeals to\r\nCongress and the States, and again the undaunted spirit and strenuous\r\nexertions of Washington saved the army and the Revolution from the\r\ninternal ruin which was his worst enemy. When the new year began, he\r\nsaw that he was again condemned to a defensive campaign, but this made\r\nlittle difference now, for what he had foreseen in the spring of 1779\r\nbecame certainty in the autumn. The active war was transferred to the\r\nsouth, where the chapter of disasters was beginning, and Clinton had\r\npractically given up everything except New York. The war had taken\r\non the new phase expected by Washington. Weak as he was, he began to\r\ndetach troops, and prepared to deal with the last desperate effort of\r\nEngland to conquer her revolted colonies from the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nARNOLD'S TREASON, AND THE WAR IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1780 was the beginning of a period of inactivity and\r\ndisappointment, of diligent effort and frustrated plans. During the\r\nmonths which ensued before the march to the south, Washington passed\r\nthrough a stress of harassing anxiety, which was far worse than\r\nanything he had to undergo at any other time. Plans were formed, only\r\nto fail. Opportunities arose, only to pass by unfulfilled. The network\r\nof hostile conditions bound him hand and foot, and it seemed at times\r\nas if he could never break the bonds that held him, or prevent or hold\r\nback the moral, social, and political dissolution going on about him.\r\nWith the aid of France, he meant to strike one decisive blow, and end\r\nthe struggle. Every moment was of importance, and yet the days and\r\nweeks and months slipped by, and he could get nothing done. He could\r\nneither gain control of the sea, nor gather sufficient forces of his\r\nown, although delay now meant ruin. He saw the British overrun the\r\nsouth, and he could not leave the Hudson. He was obliged to sacrifice\r\nthe southern States, and yet he could get neither ships nor men to\r\nattack New York. The army was starving and mutinous, and he sought\r\nrelief in vain. The finances were ruined, Congress was helpless, the\r\nStates seemed stupefied. Treason of the most desperate kind suddenly\r\nreared its head, and threatened the very citadel of the Revolution.\r\nThese were the days of the war least familiar to posterity. They\r\nare unmarked in the main by action or fighting, and on this dreary\r\nmonotony nothing stands out except the black stain of Arnold's\r\ntreason. Yet it was the time of all others when Washington had most to\r\nbear. It was the time of all others when his dogged persistence and\r\nunwavering courage alone seemed to sustain the flickering fortunes of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nIn April Washington was pondering ruefully on the condition of affairs\r\nat the south. He saw that the only hope of saving Charleston was in\r\nthe defense of the bar; and when that became indefensible, he saw that\r\nthe town ought to be abandoned to the enemy, and the army withdrawn to\r\nthe country. His military genius showed itself again and again in\r\nhis perfectly accurate judgment on distant campaigns. He seemed to\r\napprehend all the conditions at a glance, and although his wisdom\r\nmade him refuse to issue orders when he was not on the ground, those\r\ngenerals who followed his suggestions, even when a thousand miles\r\naway, were successful, and those who disregarded them were not.\r\nLincoln, commanding at Charleston, was a brave and loyal man, but he\r\nhad neither the foresight nor the courage to withdraw to the country,\r\nand then, hovering on the lines of the enemy, to confine them to the\r\ntown. He yielded to the entreaties of the citizens and remained, only\r\nto surrender. Washington had retreated from New York, and after five\r\nyears of fighting the British still held it, and had gone no further.\r\nHe had refused to risk an assault to redeem Philadelphia, at the\r\nexpense of much grumbling and cursing, and had then beaten the enemy\r\nwhen they hastily retreated thence in the following spring. His\r\ncardinal doctrine was that the Revolution depended upon the existence\r\nof the army, and not on the possession of any particular spot of\r\nground, and his masterly adherence to this theory brought victory,\r\nslowly but surely. Lincoln's very natural inability to grasp it, and\r\nto withstand popular pressure, cost us for a time the southern States\r\nand a great deal of bloody fighting.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this anxiety about the south, and when he foresaw the\r\ncoming disasters, Washington was cheered and encouraged by the arrival\r\nof Lafayette, whom he loved, and who brought good tidings of his\r\nzealous work for the United States in Paris. An army and a fleet were\r\non their way to America, with a promise of more to follow. This was\r\ngreat news indeed. It is interesting to note how Washington took it,\r\nfor we see here with unusual clearness the readiness of grasp and\r\nquickness of thought which have been noted before, but which are\r\nnot commonly attributed to him. It has been the fashion to treat\r\nWashington as wise and prudent, but as distinctly slow, and when he\r\nwas obliged to concentrate public opinion, either military or civil,\r\nor when doubt overhung his course, he moved with great deliberation.\r\nWhen he required no concentration of opinion, and had made up his\r\nmind, he could strike with a terribly swift decision, as at Trenton\r\nor Monmouth. So when a new situation presented itself he seized with\r\nwonderful rapidity every phase and possibility opened by changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe moment he learned from Lafayette that the French succors were\r\nactually on the way, he began to lay out plans in a manner which\r\nshowed how he had taken in at the first glance every chance and every\r\ncontingency. He wrote that the decisive moment was at hand, and that\r\nthe French succors would be fatal if not used successfully now.\r\nCongress must improve their methods of administration, and for this\r\npurpose must appoint a small committee to coöperate with him. This\r\nstep he demanded, and it was taken at once. Fresh from his interview\r\nwith Lafayette, he sent out orders to have inquiries made as to\r\nHalifax and its defenses. Possibly a sudden and telling blow might\r\nbe struck there, and nothing should be overlooked. He also wrote to\r\nLafayette to urge upon the French commander an immediate assault on\r\nNew York the moment he landed. Yet despite his thought for New York,\r\nhe even then began to see the opportunities which were destined to\r\ndevelop into Yorktown. He had longed to go to the south before, and\r\nhad held back only because he felt that the main army and New York\r\nwere still the key of the position, and could not be safely abandoned.\r\nNow, while planning the capture of New York, he asked in a letter\r\nwhether the enemy was not more exposed at the southward and therefore\r\na better subject for a combined attack there. Clearness and precision\r\nof plan as to the central point, joined to a perfect readiness to\r\nchange suddenly and strike hard and decisively in a totally different\r\nquarter, are sure marks of the great commander. We can find them all\r\nthrough the correspondence, but here in May, 1780, they come out with\r\npeculiar vividness. They are qualities arising from a wide foresight,\r\nand from a sure and quick perception. They are not the qualities of a\r\nslow or heavy mind.\r\n\r\nOn June 1 came the news of the surrender of Charleston and the loss of\r\nthe army, which was followed by the return of Clinton to New York. The\r\nsouthern States lay open now to the enemy, and it was a severe trial\r\nto Washington to be unable to go to their rescue; but with the same\r\ndogged adherence to his ruling idea, he concentrated his attention\r\non the Hudson with renewed vigilance on account of Clinton's return.\r\nAdversity and prosperity alike were unable to divert him from the\r\ncontrol of the great river and the mastery of the middle States until\r\nhe saw conclusive victory elsewhere fairly within his grasp. In the\r\nsame unswerving way he pushed on the preparations for what he felt to\r\nbe the coming of the decisive campaign and the supreme moment of the\r\nwar. To all the governors went urgent letters, calling on the States\r\nto fill their lines in the continental army, and to have their militia\r\nin readiness.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these anxieties and preparations, the French arrived\r\nat Newport, bringing a well-equipped army of some five thousand men,\r\nand a small fleet. They brought, too, something quite as important,\r\nin the way of genuine good-will and full intention to do all in their\r\npower for their allies. After a moment's hesitation, born of unlucky\r\nmemories, the people of Rhode Island gave De Rochambeau a hearty\r\nwelcome, and Washington sent him the most cordial greeting. With the\r\ngreeting went the polite but earnest request for immediate action,\r\ntogether with plans for attacking New York; and, at the same time,\r\nanother urgent call went out to the States for men, money, and\r\nsupplies. The long-looked-for hour had arrived, a fine French army was\r\nin Newport, a French fleet rode in the harbor, and instead of action,\r\nimmediate and effective, the great event marked only the beginning of\r\na period of delays and disappointment, wearing heart and nerve almost\r\nbeyond endurance.\r\n\r\nFirst it appeared that the French ships could not get into New York\r\nharbor. Then there was sickness in the French army. Then the British\r\nmenaced Newport, and rapid preparations had to be made to meet that\r\ndanger. Then it came out that De Rochambeau was ordered to await the\r\narrival of the second division of the army, with more ships; and after\r\ndue waiting, it was discovered that the aforesaid second division,\r\nwith their ships, were securely blockaded by the English fleet at\r\nBrest. On our side it was no better; indeed, it was rather worse.\r\nThere was lack of arms and powder. The drafts were made with\r\ndifficulty, and the new levies came in slowly. Supplies failed\r\naltogether, and on every hand there was nothing but delay, and ever\r\nfresh delay, and in the midst of it all Washington, wrestling with\r\nsloth and incoherence and inefficiency, trampled down one failure and\r\ndisappointment only to encounter another, equally important, equally\r\npetty, and equally harassing.\r\n\r\nOn August 20 he wrote to Congress a long and most able letter, which\r\nset forth forcibly the evil and perilous condition of affairs. After\r\nreading that letter no man could say that there was not need of the\r\nutmost exertion, and for the expenditure of the last ounce of energy.\r\nIn it Washington struck especially at the two delusions with which\r\nthe people and their representatives were lulling themselves into\r\nsecurity, and by which they were led to relax their efforts. One was\r\nthe belief that England was breaking down; the other, that the arrival\r\nof the French was synonymous with the victorious close of the war.\r\nWashington demonstrated that England still commanded the sea, and that\r\nas long as she did so there was a great advantage on her side. She\r\nwas stronger, on the whole, this year than the year before, and her\r\nfinancial resources were still ample. There was no use in looking for\r\nvictory in the weakness of the enemy, and on the other hand, to rely\r\nwholly on France was contemptible as well as foolish. After stating\r\nplainly that the army was on the verge of dissolution, he said: \"To me\r\nit will appear miraculous if our affairs can maintain themselves much\r\nlonger in their present train. If either the temper or the resources\r\nof the country will not admit of an alteration, we may expect soon\r\nto be reduced to the humiliating condition of seeing the cause of\r\nAmerica, in America, upheld by foreign arms. The generosity of our\r\nallies has a claim to all our confidence and all our gratitude, but\r\nit is neither for the honor of America, nor for the interest of the\r\ncommon cause, to leave the work entirely to them.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been bitter to Washington above all men, with his high\r\ndignity and keen sense of national honor, to write such words as\r\nthese, or make such an argument to any of his countrymen. But it was a\r\nwork which the time demanded, and he did it without flinching. Having\r\nthus laid bare the weak places, he proceeded to rehearse once more,\r\nwith a weariness we can easily fancy, the old, old lesson as to\r\norganization, a permanent army, and a better system of administration.\r\nThis letter neither scolded, nor bewailed, nor desponded, but it told\r\nthe truth with great force and vigor. Of course it had but slight\r\nresults, comparatively speaking; still it did something, and the final\r\nsuccess of the Revolution is due to the series of strong truth-telling\r\nletters, of which this is an example, as much as to any one thing done\r\nby Washington. There was need of some one, not only to fight battles\r\nand lead armies, but to drive Congress into some sort of harmony, spur\r\nthe careless and indifferent to action, arouse the States, and kill\r\nvarious fatal delusions, and in Washington the robust teller of\r\nunwelcome truths was found.\r\n\r\nStill, even the results actually obtained by such letters came but\r\nslowly, and Washington felt that he must strike at all hazards.\r\nThrough Lafayette he tried to get De Rochambeau to agree to an\r\nimmediate attack on New York. His army was on the very eve of\r\ndissolution, and he began with reason to doubt his own power of\r\nholding it together longer. The finances of the country were going\r\never faster to irremediable ruin, and it seemed impossible that\r\nanything could postpone open and avowed bankruptcy. So, with his army\r\ncrumbling, mutinous, and half starved, he turned to his one unfailing\r\nresource of fighting, and tried to persuade De Rochambeau to join\r\nhim. Under the circumstances, Washington was right to wish to risk a\r\nbattle, and De Rochambeau, from his point of view, was equally so in\r\nrefusing to take the offensive, unless the second division arrived or\r\nDe Guichen came with his fleet, or the English force at New York was\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nIn these debates and delays, mingled with an appeal to De Guichen in\r\nthe West Indies, the summer was fast wearing away, and, by way of\r\naddition, early in September came tidings of the battle of Camden,\r\nand the utter rout of Gates's army. Despite his own needs and trials,\r\nWashington's first idea was to stem the current of disaster at the\r\nsouth, and he ordered the fresh Maryland troops to turn back at once\r\nand march to the Carolinas, but Gates fled so fast and far that it\r\nwas some time before anything was heard of him. As more news came of\r\nCamden and its beaten general, Washington wrote to Rutledge that he\r\nshould ultimately come southward. Meantime, he could only struggle\r\nwith his own difficulties, and rack his brains for men and means to\r\nrescue the south. It must have seemed to Washington, in those lovely\r\nSeptember days, as if fate could not have any worse trials in store,\r\nand that if he could only breast the troubles now surging about him,\r\nhe might count on sure and speedy success. Yet the bitterest trial of\r\nall was even then hanging over his head, and with a sort of savage\r\nsarcasm it came upon him in one of those rare moments when he had an\r\nhour of rest and sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe story of Arnold's treason is easily told. Its romantic side\r\nhas made it familiar to all Americans, and given it a factitious\r\nimportance. Had it succeeded it would have opened opportunities of\r\ndisaster to the American arms, although it would not have affected\r\nthe final outcome of the Revolution. As it was it failed, and had no\r\nresult whatever. It has passed into history simply as a picturesque\r\nepisode, charged with possibilities which attract the imagination, but\r\nhaving, in itself, neither meaning nor consequences beyond the two\r\nconspirators. To us it is of interest, because it shows Washington in\r\none of the sharpest and bitterest experiences of his life. Let us see\r\nhow he met it and dealt with it.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when the French landed, both De Rochambeau and\r\nWashington had been most anxious to meet. The French general had been\r\nparticularly urgent, but it was difficult for Washington to get away.\r\nAs he wrote on August 21: \"We are about ten miles from the enemy. Our\r\npopular government imposes a necessity of great circumspection. If\r\nany misfortune should happen in my absence, it would be attended with\r\nevery inconvenience. I will, however, endeavor if possible, and as\r\nsoon as possible, to meet you at some convenient rendezvous.\" In\r\naccordance with this promise, a few weeks later, he left Greene in\r\ncommand of the army, and, not without misgivings, started on September\r\n18 to meet De Rochambeau. On his way he had an interview with Arnold,\r\nwho came to him to show a letter from the loyalist Colonel Robinson,\r\nand thus disarm suspicion as to his doings. On the 20th, the day when\r\nAndré and Arnold met to arrange the terms of the sale, Washington was\r\nwith De Rochambeau at Hartford. News had arrived, meantime, that De\r\nGuichen had sailed for Europe; the command of the sea was therefore\r\nlost, and the opportunity for action had gone by. There was no need\r\nfor further conference, and Washington accordingly set out on his\r\nreturn at once, two or three days earlier than he had intended.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by his own staff, and by Knox and Lafayette with\r\ntheir officers. With him, too, went the young Count Dumas, who has\r\nleft a description of their journey, and of the popular enthusiasm\r\ndisplayed in the towns through which they passed. In one village,\r\nwhich they reached after nightfall, all the people turned out, the\r\nchildren bearing torches, and men and women hailed Washington as\r\nfather, and pressed about him to touch the hem of his garments.\r\nTurning to Dumas he said, \"We may be beaten by the English; it is\r\nthe chance of war; but there is the army they will never conquer.\"\r\nPolitical leaders grumbled, and military officers caballed, but\r\nthe popular feeling went out to Washington with a sure and utter\r\nconfidence. The people in that little village recognized the great and\r\nunselfish leader as they recognized Lincoln a century later, and from\r\nthe masses of the people no one ever heard the cry that Washington was\r\ncold or unsympathetic. They loved him, and believed in him, and such a\r\nmanifestation of their devotion touched him deeply. His spirits rose\r\nunder the spell of appreciation and affection, always so strong upon\r\nhuman nature, and he rode away from Fishkill the next morning at\r\ndaybreak with a light heart.\r\n\r\nThe company was pleasant and lively, the morning was fair, and as they\r\napproached Arnold's headquarters at the Robinson house, Washington\r\nturned off to the redoubts by the river, telling the young men that\r\nthey were all in love with Mrs. Arnold and would do well to go\r\nstraight on and breakfast with her. Hamilton and McHenry followed his\r\nadvice, and while they were at breakfast a note was brought to Arnold.\r\nIt was the letter of warning from André announcing his capture, which\r\nColonel Jameson, who ought to have been cashiered for doing it, had\r\nforwarded. Arnold at once left the table, and saying that he was going\r\nto West Point, jumped into his boat and was rowed rapidly down the\r\nriver to the British man-of-war. Washington on his arrival was told\r\nthat Arnold had gone to the fort, and so after a hasty breakfast he\r\nwent over there himself. On reaching West Point no salute broke the\r\nstillness, and no guard turned out to receive him. He was astonished\r\nto learn that his arrival was unexpected, and that Arnold had not been\r\nthere for two days. Still unsuspecting he inspected the works, and\r\nthen returned.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the messenger sent to Hartford with the papers taken on\r\nAndré reached the Robinson house and delivered them to Hamilton,\r\ntogether with a letter of confession from André himself. Hamilton read\r\nthem, and hurrying out met Washington just coming up from the river.\r\nHe took his chief aside, said a few words to him in a low voice, and\r\nthey went into the house together. When they came out, Washington\r\nlooked as calm as ever, and calling to Lafayette and Knox gave them\r\nthe papers, saying simply, \"Whom can we trust now?\" He dispatched\r\nHamilton at once to try to intercept Arnold at Verplanck's Point, but\r\nit was too late; the boat had passed, and Arnold was safe on board the\r\nVulture. This done, Washington bade his staff sit down with him at\r\ndinner, as the general was absent, and Mrs. Arnold was ill in her\r\nroom. Dinner over, he immediately set about guarding the post, which\r\nhad been so near betrayal. To Colonel Wade at West Point he wrote:\r\n\"Arnold has gone to the enemy; you are in command, be vigilant.\" To\r\nJameson he sent word to guard André closely. To the colonels and\r\ncommanders of various outlying regiments he sent orders to bring up\r\ntheir troops. Everything was done that should have been done, quickly,\r\nquietly, and without comment. The most sudden and appalling treachery\r\nhad failed to shake his nerve, or confuse his mind.\r\n\r\nYet the strong and silent man was wrung to the quick, and when\r\neverything possible had been done, and he had retired to his room, the\r\nguard outside the door heard him marching back and forth through all\r\nthe weary night. The one thing he least expected, because he least\r\nunderstood it, had come to pass. He had been a good and true friend to\r\nthe villain who had fled, for Arnold's reckless bravery and dare-devil\r\nfighting had appealed to the strongest passion of his nature, and he\r\nhad stood by him always. He had grieved over the refusal of Congress\r\nto promote him in due order and had interceded with ultimate success\r\nin his behalf. He had sympathized with him in his recent troubles\r\nin Philadelphia, and had administered the reprimand awarded by the\r\ncourt-martial so that rebuke seemed turned to praise. He had sought\r\nto give him every opportunity that a soldier could desire, and had\r\nfinally conferred upon him the command of West Point. He had admired\r\nhis courage and palliated his misconduct, and now the scoundrel had\r\nturned on him and fled. Mingled with the bitterness of these memories\r\nof betrayed confidence was the torturing ignorance of how far this\r\nbase treachery had extended. For all he knew there might be a brood of\r\ntraitors about him in the very citadel of America. We can never know\r\nWashington's thoughts at that time, for he was ever silent, but as we\r\nlisten in imagination to the sound of the even footfalls which the\r\nguard heard all through that September night, we can dimly guess the\r\nfeelings of the strong and passionate nature, wounded and distressed\r\nalmost beyond endurance.\r\n\r\nThere is but little more to tell. The conspiracy stopped with Arnold.\r\nHe had no accomplices, and meant to deliver the post and pocket the\r\nbooty alone. The British tried to spread the idea that other officers\r\nhad been corrupted, but the attempt failed, and Washington's prompt\r\nmeasures of defense checked any movement against the forts. Every\r\neffort was made by Clinton to save André, but in vain. He was tried\r\nby a court composed of the highest officers in the American service,\r\namong whom was Lafayette. On his own statement, but one decision was\r\npossible. He was condemned as a spy, and as a spy he was sentenced to\r\nbe hanged. He made a manly appeal against the manner of his death, and\r\nbegged to be shot. Washington declined to interfere, and André went to\r\nthe gallows.\r\n\r\nThe British, at the time, and some of their writers afterwards,\r\nattacked Washington for insisting on this mode of execution, but there\r\nnever was an instance in his career when he was more entirely right.\r\nAndré was a spy and briber, who sought to ruin the American cause\r\nby means of the treachery of an American general. It was a dark and\r\ndangerous game, and he knew that he staked his life on the result. He\r\nfailed, and paid the penalty. Washington could not permit, he would\r\nhave been grossly and feebly culpable if he had permitted, such an\r\nattempt to pass without extreme punishment. He was generous and\r\nmagnanimous, but he was not a sentimentalist, and he punished this\r\nmiserable treason, so far as he could reach it, as it deserved. It is\r\ntrue that André was a man of talent, well-bred and courageous, and of\r\nengaging manners. He deserved all the sympathy and sorrow which he\r\nexcited at the time, but nothing more. He was not only technically a\r\nspy, but he had sought his ends by bribery, he had prostituted a flag\r\nof truce, and he was to be richly paid for his work. It was all hire\r\nand salary. No doubt André was patriotic and loyal. Many spies have\r\nbeen the same, and have engaged in their dangerous exploits from\r\nthe highest motives. Nathan Hale, whom the British hanged without\r\ncompunction, was as well-born and well-bred as André, and as patriotic\r\nas man could be, and moreover he was a spy and nothing more. André\r\nwas a trafficker in bribes and treachery, and however we may pity his\r\nfate, his name has no proper place in the great temple at Westminster,\r\nwhere all English-speaking people bow with reverence, and only a most\r\nperverted sentimentality could conceive that it was fitting to erect a\r\nmonument to his memory in this country.\r\n\r\nWashington sent André to the gallows because it was his duty to do so,\r\nbut he pitied him none the less, and whatever he may have thought of\r\nthe means André employed to effect his end, he made no comment upon\r\nhim, except to say that \"he met his fate with that fortitude which was\r\nto be expected from an accomplished man and gallant officer.\" As to\r\nArnold, he was almost equally silent. When obliged to refer to him he\r\ndid so in the plainest and simplest way, and only in a familiar letter\r\nto Laurens do we get a glimpse of his feelings. He wrote: \"I am\r\nmistaken if at this time Arnold is undergoing the torment of a mental\r\nhell. He wants feeling. From some traits of his character which have\r\nlately come to my knowledge, he seems to have been so hackneyed in\r\nvillainy, and so lost to all sense of honor and shame, that, while his\r\nfaculties will enable him to continue his sordid pursuits, there will\r\nbe no time for remorse.\" With this single expression of measureless\r\ncontempt, Washington let Arnold drop from his life. The first shock\r\nhad touched him to the quick, although it could not shake his steady\r\nmind. Reflection revealed to him the extraordinary baseness of\r\nArnold's real character, and he cast the thought of him out forever,\r\ncontent to leave the traitor to the tender mercies of history. The\r\ncalmness and dignity, the firmness and deep feeling which Washington\r\nexhibited, are of far more interest than the abortive treason, and\r\nhave as real a value now as they had then, when suspicion for a moment\r\nran riot, and men wondered \"whom they could trust.\"\r\n\r\nThe treason of Arnold swept like a black cloud across the sky, broke,\r\nand left everything as before. That such a base peril should have\r\nexisted was alarming and hateful. That it should have been exploded\r\nharmlessly made all men give a deep sigh of relief. But neither the\r\ntreason nor its discovery altered the current of events one jot. The\r\nsummer had come and gone. The French had arrived, and no blow had\r\nbeen struck. There was nothing to show for the campaign but\r\ninaction, disappointment, and the loss of the Carolinas. With the\r\ncommander-in-chief, through it all, were ever present two great\r\nquestions, getting more portentous and more difficult of solution with\r\neach succeeding day. How he was to keep his army in existence was one,\r\nand how he was to hold the government together was the other. He\r\nhad thirteen tired States, a general government almost impotent, a\r\nbankrupt treasury, and a broken credit. The American Revolution had\r\ncome down to the question of whether the brain, will, and nerve of one\r\nman could keep the machine going long enough to find fit opportunity\r\nfor a final and decisive stroke. Washington had confidence in the\r\npeople of the country and in himself, but the difficulties in the way\r\nwere huge, and the means of surmounting them slight. There is here\r\nand there a passionate undertone in the letters of this period, which\r\nshows us the moments when the waves of trouble and disaster seemed to\r\nsweep over him. But the feeling passed, or was trampled under\r\nfoot, for there was no break in the steady fight against untoward\r\ncircumstances, or in the grim refusal to accept defeat.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible now to conceive the actual condition at that\r\ntime of every matter of detail which makes military and political\r\nexistence possible. No general phrases can do justice to the situation\r\nof the army; and the petty miseries and privations, which made life\r\nunendurable, went on from day to day in ever varying forms. While\r\nWashington was hearing the first ill news from the south and\r\nstruggling with the problem on that side, and at the same time was\r\nplanning with Lafayette how to take advantage of the French succors,\r\nthe means of subsisting his army were wholly giving out. The men\r\nactually had no food. For days, as Washington wrote, there was no meat\r\nat all in camp. Goaded by hunger, a Connecticut regiment mutinied.\r\nThey were brought back to duty, but held out steadily for their pay,\r\nwhich they had not received for five months. Indeed, the whole army\r\nwas more or less mutinous, and it was only by the utmost tact that\r\nWashington kept them from wholesale desertion. After the summer had\r\npassed and the chance for a decisive campaign had gone with it, the\r\nexcitement of expected action ceased to sustain the men, and the\r\nunclothed, unpaid, unfed soldiers began again to get restive. We can\r\nimagine what the condition of the rank and file must have been when\r\nwe find that Washington himself could not procure an express from\r\nthe quartermaster-general, and was obliged to send a letter to the\r\nMinister of France by the unsafe and slow medium of the post. He was\r\nexpected to carry on a war against a rich and powerful enemy, and he\r\ncould not even pay a courier to carry his dispatches.\r\n\r\nWith the commander-in-chief thus straitened, the sufferings of the\r\nmen grew to be intolerable, and the spirit of revolt which had been\r\nchecked through the summer began again to appear. At last, in January,\r\n1781, it burst all the bounds. The Pennsylvania line mutinied and\r\nthreatened Congress. Attempts on the part of the English to seduce\r\nthem failed, but they remained in a state of open rebellion. The\r\nofficers were powerless, and it looked as if the disaffection would\r\nspread, and the whole army go to pieces in the very face of the enemy.\r\nWashington held firm, and intended in his unshaken way to bring them\r\nback to their duty without yielding in a dangerous fashion. But the\r\ngovernment of Pennsylvania, at last thoroughly frightened, rushed into\r\nthe field, and patched up a compromise which contained most perilous\r\nconcessions. The natural consequence was a fresh mutiny in the New\r\nJersey line, and this time Washington determined that he would not be\r\nforestalled. He sent forward at once some regiments of loyal troops,\r\nsuppressed the mutiny suddenly and with a strong hand, and hanged\r\ntwo of the ringleaders. The difficulty was conquered, and discipline\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nTo take this course required great boldness, for these mutinies were\r\nof no ordinary character. In the first place, it was impossible to\r\ntell whether any troops would do their duty against their fellows, and\r\nfailure would have been fatal. In the second place, the grievances\r\nof the soldiers were very great, and their complaints were entirely\r\nrighteous. Washington felt the profoundest sympathy with his men, and\r\nit was no easy matter to maintain order with soldiers tried almost\r\nbeyond endurance, against their comrades whose claims were just. Two\r\nthings saved the army. One was Washington's great influence with the\r\nmen and their utter belief in him. The other was the quality of\r\nthe men themselves. Lafayette said they were the most patient and\r\npatriotic soldiers the world had seen, and it is easy to believe him.\r\nThe wonder is, not that they mutinied when they did, but that the\r\nwhole army had not mutinied and abandoned the struggle years before.\r\nThe misfortunes and mistakes of the Revolution, to whomever due, were\r\nin no respect to be charged to the army, and the conduct of the troops\r\nthrough all the dreary months of starvation and cold and poverty is\r\na proof of the intelligent patriotism and patient courage of the\r\nAmerican soldier which can never be gainsaid. To fight successful\r\nbattles is the test of a good general, but to hold together a\r\nsuffering army through years of unexampled privations, to meet endless\r\nfailure of details with unending expedients, and then to fight battles\r\nand plan campaigns, shows a leader who was far more than a good\r\ngeneral. Such multiplied trials and difficulties are overcome only by\r\na great soldier who with small means achieves large results, and by a\r\ngreat man who by force of will and character can establish with all\r\nwho follow him a power which no miseries can conquer, and no suffering\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nThe height reached by the troubles in the army and their menacing\r\ncharacter had, however, a good as well as a bad side. They penetrated\r\nthe indifference and carelessness of both Congress and the States.\r\nGentlemen in the confederate and local administrations and\r\nlegislatures woke up to a realizing sense that the dissolution of the\r\narmy meant a general wreck, in which their own necks would be in very\r\nconsiderable danger; and they also had an uneasy feeling that starving\r\nand mutinous soldiers were very uncertain in taking revenge.\r\nThe condition of the army gave a sudden and piercing reality to\r\nWashington's indignant words to Mathews on October 4: \"At a time when\r\npublic harmony is so essential, when we should aid and assist each\r\nother with all our abilities, when our hearts should be open to\r\ninformation and our hands ready to administer relief, to find\r\ndistrusts and jealousies taking possession of the mind and a party\r\nspirit prevailing affords a most melancholy reflection, and forebodes\r\nno good.\" The hoarse murmur of impending mutiny emphasized strongly\r\nthe words written on the same day to Duane: \"The history of the war is\r\na history of false hopes and temporary expedients. Would to God they\r\nwere to end here.\"\r\n\r\nThe events in the south, too, had a sobering effect. The congressional\r\ngeneral Gates had not proved a success. His defeat at Camden had\r\nbeen terribly complete, and his flight had been too rapid to inspire\r\nconfidence in his capacity for recuperation. The members of Congress\r\nwere thus led to believe that as managers of military matters they\r\nleft much to be desired; and when Washington, on October 11, addressed\r\nto them one of his long and admirable letters on reorganization, it\r\nwas received in a very chastened spirit. They had listened to many\r\nsuch letters before, and had benefited by them always a little,\r\nbut danger and defeat gave this one peculiar point. They therefore\r\naccepted the situation, and adopted all the suggestions of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. They also in the same reasonable frame of mind\r\ndetermined that Washington should select the next general for the\r\nsouthern army. A good deal could have been saved had this decision\r\nbeen reached before; but even now it was not too late. October 14,\r\nWashington appointed Greene to this post of difficulty and danger, and\r\nGreene's assumption of the command marks the turning-point in the\r\ntide of disaster, and the beginning of the ultimate expulsion of the\r\nBritish from the only portion of the colonies where they had made a\r\ntolerable campaign.\r\n\r\nThe uses of adversity, moreover, did not stop here. They extended to\r\nthe States, which began to grow more vigorous in action, and to show\r\nsigns of appreciating the gravity of the situation and the duties\r\nwhich rested upon them. This change and improvement both in Congress\r\nand the States came none too soon. Indeed, as it was, the results of\r\ntheir renewed efforts were too slow to be felt at once by the army,\r\nand mutinies broke out even after the new spirit had shown itself.\r\nWashington also sent Knox to travel from State to State, to see the\r\nvarious governors, and lay the situation of affairs before them; yet\r\neven with such a text it was a difficult struggle to get the States to\r\nmake quick and strong exertions sufficient to prevent a partial mutiny\r\nfrom becoming a general revolt. The lesson, however, had had its\r\neffect. For the moment, at least, the cause was saved. The worst\r\ndefects were temporarily remedied, and something was done toward\r\nsupplies and subsistence. The army would be able to exist through\r\nanother winter, and face another summer. Then the next campaign might\r\nbring the decisive moment; but still, who could tell? Years, instead\r\nof months, might yet elapse before the end was reached, and then no\r\nman could say what the result would be.\r\n\r\nWashington saw plainly enough that the relief and improvement were\r\nonly temporary, and that carelessness and indifference were likely to\r\nreturn, and be more case-hardened than ever. He was too strong and\r\nsane a man to waste time in fighting shadows or in nourishing himself\r\nwith hopes. He dealt with the present as he found it, and fought down\r\ndifficulties as they sprang up in his path. But he was also a man of\r\nextraordinary prescience, with a foresight as penetrating as it was\r\njudicious. It was, perhaps, his most remarkable gift, and while\r\nhe controlled the present he studied the future. Outside of the\r\noperations of armies, and the plans of campaign, he saw, as the\r\nwar progressed, that the really fatal perils were involved in the\r\npolitical system. At the beginning of the Revolution there was no\r\norganization outside the local state governments. Congress voted and\r\nresolved in favor of anything that seemed proper, and the States\r\nresponded to their appeal. In the first flush of revolution, and the\r\nfirst excitement of freedom, this was all very well. But as the\r\nearly passion cooled, and a long and stubborn struggle, replete with\r\nsufferings and defeat, developed itself, the want of system began to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest tasks of Congress was the formation of articles\r\nfor a general government, but state jealousies, and the delays\r\nincident to the movements of thirteen sovereignties, prevented their\r\nadoption until the war was nearly over. Washington, suffering from all\r\nthe complicated troubles of jarring States and general incoherence,\r\nlonged for and urged the adoption of the act of confederation. He saw\r\nsooner than any one else, and with more painful intensity, the need of\r\nbetter union and more energetic government. As the days and months of\r\ndifficulties and trials went by, the suggestions on this question in\r\nhis letters grew more frequent and more urgent, and they showed the\r\ninsight of the statesman and practical man of affairs. How much he\r\nhoped from the final acceptance of the act of confederation it is not\r\neasy to say, but he hoped for some improvement certainly. When at last\r\nit went into force, he saw almost at once that it would not do, and in\r\nthe spring of 1780 he knew it to be a miserable failure. The system\r\nwhich had been established was really no better than that which had\r\npreceded it. With alarm and disgust Washington found himself flung\r\nback on what he called \"the pernicious state system,\" and with worse\r\nprospects than ever.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Revolution he had never given attention to the\r\nphilosophy or science of government, but when it fell to his lot to\r\nfight the war for independence he perceived almost immediately the\r\nneed of a strong central government, and his suggestions, scattered\r\nbroadcast among his correspondents, manifested a knowledge of the\r\nconditions of the political problem possessed by no one else at that\r\nperiod. When he was satisfied of the failure of the confederation, his\r\nefforts to improve the existing administration multiplied, and he soon\r\nhad the assistance of his aide-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton, who then\r\nwrote, although little more than a boy, his remarkable letters on\r\ngovernment and finance, which were the first full expositions of the\r\npolitical necessities from which sprang the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Washington was vigorous in action and methodical in business,\r\nwhile the system of thirteen sovereignties was discordant, disorderly,\r\nand feeble in execution. He knew that the vices inherent in the\r\nconfederation were ineradicable and fatal, and he also knew that it\r\nwas useless to expect any comprehensive reforms until the war was\r\nover. The problem before him was whether the existing machine could be\r\nmade to work until the British were finally driven from the country.\r\nThe winter of 1780-81 was marked, therefore, on his part, by an urgent\r\nstriving for union, and by unceasing efforts to mend and improve the\r\nrickety system of the confederation. It was with this view that he\r\nsecured the dispatch of Laurens, whom he carefully instructed, to get\r\nmoney in Paris; for he was satisfied that it was only possible to tide\r\nover the financial difficulties by foreign loans from those interested\r\nin our success. In the same spirit he worked to bring about\r\nthe establishment of executive departments, which was finally\r\naccomplished, after delays that sorely tried his patience. These two\r\ncases were but the most important among many of similar character, for\r\nhe was always at work on these perplexing questions.\r\n\r\nIt is an astonishing proof of the strength and power of his mind that\r\nhe was able to solve the daily questions of army existence, to deal\r\nwith the allies, to plan attacks on New York, to watch and scheme for\r\nthe southern department, to cope with Arnold's treason, with mutiny,\r\nand with administrative imbecility, and at the very same time consider\r\nthe gravest governmental problems, and send forth wise suggestions,\r\nwhich met the exigencies of the moment, and laid the foundation of\r\nmuch that afterwards appeared in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. He was not a speculator on government, and after his fashion\r\nhe was engaged in dealing with the questions of the day and hour. Yet\r\nthe ideas that he put forth in this time of confusion and conflict and\r\nexpedients were so vitally sound and wise that they deserve the most\r\ncareful study in relation to after events. The political trials\r\nand difficulties of this period were the stern teachers from whom\r\nWashington acquired the knowledge and experience which made him the\r\nprincipal agent in bringing about the formation and adoption of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. We shall have occasion to examine\r\nthese opinions and views more closely when they were afterwards\r\nbrought into actual play. At this point it is only necessary to trace\r\nthe history of the methods by which he solved the problem of the\r\nRevolution before the political system of the confederation became\r\nabsolutely useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nYORKTOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure to accomplish anything in the north caused Washington,\r\nas the year drew to a close, to turn his thoughts once more toward a\r\ncombined movement at the south. In pursuance of this idea, he devised\r\na scheme of uniting with the Spaniards in the seizure of Florida, and\r\nof advancing thence through Georgia to assail the English in the rear.\r\nDe Rochambeau did not approve the plan, and it was abandoned; but the\r\nidea of a southern movement was still kept steadily in sight. The\r\ngoverning thought now was, not to protect this place or that, but to\r\ncast aside everything else in order to strike one great blow which\r\nwould finish the war. Where he could do this, time alone would show,\r\nbut if one follows the correspondence closely, it is apparent that\r\nWashington's military instinct turned more and more toward the south.\r\n\r\nIn that department affairs changed their aspect rapidly. January 17,\r\nMorgan won his brilliant victory at the Cowpens, withdrew in good\r\norder with his prisoners, and united his army with that of Greene.\r\nCornwallis was terribly disappointed by this unexpected reverse, but\r\nhe determined to push on, defeat the combined American army, and then\r\njoin the British forces on the Chesapeake. Greene was too weak to risk\r\na battle, and made a masterly retreat of two hundred miles before\r\nCornwallis, escaping across the Dan only twelve hours ahead of the\r\nenemy. The moment the British moved away, Greene recrossed the river\r\nand hung upon their rear. For a month he kept in their neighborhood,\r\nchecking the rising of the Tories, and declining battle. At last he\r\nreceived reinforcements, felt strong enough to stand his ground, and\r\non March 15 the battle of Guilford Court House was fought. It was a\r\nsharp and bloody fight; the British had the advantage, and Greene\r\nabandoned the field, bringing off his army in good order. Cornwallis,\r\non his part, had suffered so heavily, however, that his victory turned\r\nto ashes. On the 18th he was in full retreat, with Greene in hot\r\nchase, and it was not until the 28th that he succeeded in getting over\r\nthe Deep River and escaping to Wilmington. Thence he determined to\r\npush on and transfer the seat of war to the Chesapeake. Greene, with\r\nthe boldness and quickness which showed him to be a soldier of a high\r\norder, now dropped the pursuit and turned back to fight the British in\r\ndetachments and free the southern States. There is no need to follow\r\nhim in the brilliant operations which ensued, and by which he achieved\r\nthis result. It is sufficient to say here that he had altered the\r\nwhole aspect of the war, forced Cornwallis into Virginia within reach\r\nof Washington, and begun the work of redeeming the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nThe troops which Cornwallis intended to join had been sent in\r\ndetachments to Virginia during the winter and spring. The first body\r\nhad arrived early in January under the command of Arnold, and a\r\ngeneral marauding and ravaging took place. A little later General\r\nPhillips arrived with reinforcements and took command. On May 13,\r\nGeneral Phillips died, and a week later Cornwallis appeared at\r\nPetersburg, assumed control, and sent Arnold back to New York.\r\n\r\nMeantime Washington, though relieved by Morgan's and Greene's\r\nadmirable work, had a most trying and unhappy winter and spring. He\r\nsent every man he could spare, and more than he ought to have spared,\r\nto Greene, and he stripped himself still further when the invasion of\r\nVirginia began. But for the most part he was obliged, from lack of any\r\nnaval strength, to stand helplessly by and see more and more British\r\ntroops sent to the south, and witness the ravaging of his native\r\nState, without any ability to prevent it. To these grave trials was\r\nadded a small one, which stung him to the quick. The British came up\r\nthe Potomac, and Lund Washington, in order to preserve Mount Vernon,\r\ngave them refreshments, and treated them in a conciliatory manner. He\r\nmeant well but acted ill, and Washington wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a less painful circumstance to me to have heard\r\nthat, in consequence of your non-compliance with their request, they\r\nhad burnt my house and laid the plantation in ruins. You ought to have\r\nconsidered yourself as my representative, and should have reflected\r\non the bad example of communicating with the enemy, and making a\r\nvoluntary offer of refreshments to them, with a view to prevent a\r\nconflagration.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a clear glimpse this little episode gives of the earnestness of\r\nthe man who wrote these lines. He could not bear the thought that any\r\nfavor should be shown him on any pretense. He was ready to take his\r\nshare of the marauding and pillaging with the rest, but he was deeply\r\nindignant at the idea that any one representing him should even appear\r\nto ask a favor of the British.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the spring of 1781 was very trying, for there was nothing\r\nso galling to Washington as to be unable to fight. He wanted to get to\r\nthe south, but he was bound hand and foot by lack of force. Yet the\r\nobstacles did not daunt or depress him. He wrote in June that he felt\r\nsure of bringing the war to a happy conclusion, and in the division of\r\nthe British forces he saw his opportunity taking shape. Greene had\r\nthe southern forces well in hand. Cornwallis was equally removed from\r\nClinton on the north and Rawdon on the south, and had come within\r\nreach; so that if he could but have naval strength he could fall upon\r\nCornwallis with superior force and crush him. In naval matters fortune\r\nthus far had dealt hardly with him, yet he could not but feel that\r\na French fleet of sufficient force must soon come. He grasped the\r\nsituation with a master-hand, and began to prepare the way. Still he\r\nkept his counsel strictly to himself, and set to work to threaten, and\r\nif possible to attack, New York, not with much hope of succeeding\r\nin any such attempt, but with a view of frightening Clinton and of\r\ninducing him either to withdraw troops from Virginia, or at least to\r\nwithhold reinforcements. As he began his Virginian campaign in this\r\ndistant and remote fashion at the mouth of the Hudson, he was cheered\r\nby news that De Grasse, the French admiral, had sent recruits to\r\nNewport, and intended to come himself to the American coast. He at\r\nonce wrote De Grasse not to determine absolutely to come to New\r\nYork, hinting that it might prove more advisable to operate to the\r\nsouthward. It required great tact to keep the French fleet where he\r\nneeded it, and yet not reveal his intentions, and nothing showed\r\nWashington's foresight more plainly than the manner in which he made\r\nthe moves in this campaign, when miles of space and weeks of time\r\nseparated him from the final object of his plans. To trace this\r\nmastery of details, and the skill with which every point was\r\nremembered and covered, would require a long and minute narrative.\r\nThey can only be indicated here sufficiently to show how exactly each\r\nmovement fitted in its place, and how all together brought the great\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nFortified by the good news from De Grasse, Washington had an interview\r\nwith De Rochambeau, and effected a junction with the French army. Thus\r\nstrengthened, he opened his campaign against Cornwallis by beginning a\r\nmovement against Clinton. The troops were massed above the city, and\r\nan effort was made to surprise the upper posts and destroy Delancey's\r\npartisan corps. The attempt, although well planned, failed of its\r\nimmediate purpose, giving Washington opportunity only for an effective\r\nreconnoissance of the enemy's positions. But the move was perfectly\r\nsuccessful in its real and indirect object. Clinton was alarmed. He\r\nbegan to write to Cornwallis that troops should be returned to New\r\nYork, and he gave up absolutely the idea of sending more men to\r\nVirginia. Having thus convinced Clinton that New York was menaced,\r\nWashington then set to work to familiarize skillfully the minds of his\r\nallies and of Congress with the idea of a southern campaign. With this\r\nend in view, he wrote on August 2 that, if more troops arrived from\r\nVirginia, New York would be impracticable, and that the next point\r\nwas the south. The only contingency, as he set forth, was the\r\nall-important one of obtaining naval superiority. August 15 this\r\nessential condition gave promise of fulfillment, for on that day\r\ndefinite news arrived that De Grasse with his fleet was on his way to\r\nthe Chesapeake. Without a moment's hesitation, Washington began to\r\nmove, and at the same time he sent an urgent letter to the New England\r\ngovernors, demanding troops with an earnestness which he had never\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, meanwhile, during these long midsummer days, while\r\nWashington was waiting and planning, Cornwallis had been going up and\r\ndown, harrying, burning, and plundering. His cavalry had scattered the\r\nlegislature, and driven Governor Jefferson in headlong flight over the\r\nhills, while property to the value of more than three millions had\r\nbeen destroyed. Lafayette, sent by Washington to maintain the American\r\ncause, had been too weak to act decisively, but he had been true to\r\nhis general's teaching, and, refusing battle, had hung upon the flanks\r\nof the British and harassed and checked them. Joined by Wayne, he had\r\nfought an unsuccessful engagement at Green Springs, but brought off\r\nhis army, and with steady pertinacity followed the enemy to the coast,\r\ngathering strength as he moved. Now, when all was at last ready,\r\nWashington began to draw his net about Cornwallis, whom he had been\r\nkeenly watching during the victorious marauding of the summer. On the\r\nnews of the coming of the French fleet, he wrote to Lafayette to be\r\nprepared to join him when he reached Virginia, to retain Wayne, who\r\nintended to join Greene, and to stop Cornwallis at all hazards, if he\r\nattempted to go southward.\r\n\r\nCornwallis, however, had no intention of moving. He had seen the peril\r\nof his position, and had wished to withdraw to Charleston; but the\r\nministry, highly pleased with his performances, wished him to remain\r\non the Chesapeake, and decisive orders came to him to take a permanent\r\npost in that region. Clinton, moreover, was jealous of Cornwallis,\r\nand, impressed and deceived by Washington's movements, he not only\r\nsent no reinforcements, but detained three thousand Hessians, who had\r\nlately arrived. Cornwallis, therefore, had no choice, and with much\r\nwriting for aid, and some protesting, he obeyed his orders, planted\r\nhimself at Yorktown and Gloucester, and proceeded to fortify, while\r\nLafayette kept close watch upon him. Cornwallis was a good soldier and\r\na clever man, suffering, as Burgoyne did, from a stupid ministry and\r\na dull and jealous commander-in-chief. Thus hampered and burdened,\r\nhe was ready to fall a victim to the operations of a really great\r\ngeneral, whom his official superiors in England undervalued and\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nAugust 17, as soon as he had set his own machinery in motion,\r\nWashington wrote to De Grasse to meet him in the Chesapeake. He was\r\nworking now more anxiously and earnestly than at any time in the\r\nRevolution, not merely because he felt that success depended on the\r\nblow, but because he descried a new and alarming danger. He had\r\nperceived it in June, and the idea pursued him until all was over, and\r\nkept recurring in his letters during this strained and eager summer.\r\nTo Washington's eyes, watching campaigns and government at home and\r\nthe politics of Europe abroad, the signs of exhaustion, of mediation,\r\nand of coming peace across the Atlantic were plainly visible. If peace\r\nshould come as things then were, America would get independence, and\r\nbe shorn of many of her most valuable possessions. The sprawling\r\nBritish campaign of maraud and plunder, so bad in a military point of\r\nview, and about to prove fatal to Cornwallis, would, in case of sudden\r\ncessation of hostilities, be capable of the worst construction. Time,\r\ntherefore, had become of the last importance. The decisive blow must\r\nbe given at once, and before the slow political movements could come\r\nto a head. On July 14, Washington had his plan mapped out. He wrote in\r\nhis diary:--\r\n\r\n\"Matters having now come to a crisis, and a decided plan to be\r\ndetermined on, I was obliged--from the shortness of Count De Grasse's\r\npromised stay on this coast, the apparent disinclination of their\r\nnaval officers to force the harbor of New York, and the feeble\r\ncompliance of the States with my requisitions for men hitherto, and\r\nthe little prospect of greater exertions in future--to give up all\r\nideas of attacking New York, and instead thereof to remove the French\r\ntroops and a detachment from the American army to the Head of Elk, to\r\nbe transported to Virginia for the purpose of coöperating with the\r\nforce from the West Indies against the troops in that State.\"\r\n\r\nLike most of Washington's plans, this one was clear-cut and direct,\r\nand looks now simple enough, but at the moment it was hedged with\r\nalmost inconceivable difficulties at every step. The ever-present and\r\never-growing obstacles at home were there as usual. Appeals to Morris\r\nfor money were met by the most discouraging responses, and the States\r\nseemed more lethargic than ever. Neither men nor supplies could be\r\nobtained; neither transportation nor provision for the march could be\r\npromised. Then, too, in addition to all this, came a wholly new set of\r\nstumbling-blocks arising among the allies. Everything hinged on the\r\nnaval force. Washington needed it for a short time only; but for that\r\ncrucial moment he must have not only superiority but supremacy at sea.\r\nEvery French ship that could be reached must be in the Chesapeake, and\r\nWashington had had too many French fleets slip away from him at the\r\nlast moment and bring everything to naught to take any chances in this\r\ndirection. To bring about his naval supremacy required the utmost\r\ntact and good management, and that he succeeded is one of the\r\nchief triumphs of the campaign. In fact, at the very outset he was\r\nthreatened in this quarter with a serious defection. De Barras, with\r\nthe squadron of the American station, was at Boston, and it was\r\nessential that he should be united with De Grasse at Yorktown. But De\r\nBarras was nettled by the favoritism which had made De Grasse, his\r\njunior in service, his superior in command. He determined therefore to\r\ntake advantage of his orders and sail away to the north to Nova Scotia\r\nand Newfoundland, and leave De Grasse to fight it out alone. It is a\r\nhard thing to beat an opposing army, but it is equally hard to bring\r\nhuman jealousies and ambitions into the narrow path of self-sacrifice\r\nand subordination. Alarmed beyond measure at the suggested departure\r\nof the Boston squadron, Washington wrote a letter, which De Rochambeau\r\nsigned with him, urging De Barras to turn his fleet toward the\r\nChesapeake. It was a skillfully drawn missive, an adroit mingling of\r\nappeals to honor and sympathy and of vigorous demands to perform an\r\nobvious duty. The letter did its work, the diplomacy of Washington was\r\nsuccessful, and De Barras suppressed his feelings of disappointment,\r\nand agreed to go to the Chesapeake and serve under De Grasse.\r\n\r\nThis point made, Washington pushed on his preparations, or rather\r\npushed on despite his lack of preparations, and on August 17, as has\r\nbeen said, wrote to De Grasse to meet him in the Chesapeake. He left\r\nthe larger part of his own troops with Heath, to whom in carefully\r\ndrawn instructions he intrusted the grave duty of guarding the Hudson\r\nand watching the British in New York. This done, he gathered his\r\nforces together, and on August 21 the army started on its march to the\r\nsouth. On the 23d and 24th it crossed the Hudson, without annoyance\r\nfrom the British of any kind. Washington had threatened New York so\r\neffectively, and manoeuvred so successfully, that Clinton could not be\r\nshaken in his belief that the real object of the Americans was his own\r\narmy; and it was not until September 6 that he fully realized that his\r\nenemy was going to the south, and that Cornwallis was in danger. He\r\neven then hesitated and delayed, but finally dispatched Admiral Graves\r\nwith the fleet to the Chesapeake. The Admiral came upon the French\r\nearly on September 5, the very day that Washington was rejoicing in\r\nthe news that De Grasse had arrived in the Chesapeake and had landed\r\nSt. Simon and three thousand men to support Lafayette. As soon as the\r\nEnglish fleet appeared, the French, although many of their men were\r\non shore, sailed out and gave battle. An indecisive action ensued, in\r\nwhich the British suffered so much that five days later they burned\r\none of their frigates and withdrew to New York. De Grasse returned to\r\nhis anchorage, to find that De Barras had come in from Newport with\r\neight ships and ten transports carrying ordnance.\r\n\r\nWhile everything was thus moving well toward the consummation of the\r\ncampaign, Washington, in the midst of his delicate and important work\r\nof breaking camp and beginning his rapid march to the south, was\r\nharassed by the ever-recurring difficulties of the feeble and bankrupt\r\ngovernment of the confederation. He wrote again and again to Morris\r\nfor money, and finally got some. His demands for men and supplies\r\nremained almost unheeded, but somehow he got provisions enough to\r\nstart. He foresaw the most pressing need, and sent messages in all\r\ndirections for shipping to transport his army down the Chesapeake. No\r\none responded, but still he gathered the transports; at first a few,\r\nthen more, and finally, after many delays, enough to move his army to\r\nYorktown. The spectacle of such a struggle, so heroically made, one\r\nwould think, might have inspired every soul on the continent with\r\nenthusiasm; but at this very moment, while Washington was breaking\r\ncamp and marching southward, Congress was considering the reduction\r\nof the army!--which was as appropriate as it would have been for the\r\nEnglish Parliament to have reduced the navy on the eve of Trafalgar,\r\nor for Lincoln to have advised the restoration of the army to a peace\r\nfooting while Grant was fighting in the Wilderness. The fact was that\r\nthe Continental Congress was weakened in ability and very tired in\r\npoint of nerve and will-power. They saw that peace was coming, and\r\nnaturally thought that the sooner they could get it the better. They\r\nentirely failed to see, as Washington saw, that in a too sudden peace\r\nlurked the danger of the _uti possidetis_, and that the mere fact of\r\npeace by no means implied necessarily complete success. They did not,\r\nof course, effect their reductions, but they remained inert, and so\r\nfor the most part did the state governments, becoming drags upon\r\nthe wheels of war instead of helpers to the man who was driving the\r\nRevolution forward to its goal. Both state and confederate governments\r\nstill meant well, but they were worn out and relaxed. Yet over and\r\nthrough all these heavy masses of misapprehension and feebleness,\r\nWashington made his way. Here again all that can be said is that\r\nsomehow or other the thing was done. We can take account of the\r\nresisting forces, but we cannot tell just how they were dealt with.\r\nWe only know that one strong man trampled them down and got what he\r\nwanted done.\r\n\r\nPushing on after the joyful news of the arrival of De Grasse had been\r\nreceived, Washington left the army to go by water from the Head of\r\nElk, and hurried to Mount Vernon, accompanied by De Rochambeau. It\r\nwas six years since he had seen his home. He had left it a Virginian\r\ncolonel, full of forebodings for his country, with a vast and unknown\r\nproblem awaiting solution at his hands. He returned to it the first\r\nsoldier of his day, after six years of battle and trial, of victory\r\nand defeat, on the eve of the last and crowning triumph. As he paused\r\non the well-beloved spot, and gazed across the broad and beautiful\r\nriver at his feet, thoughts and remembrances must have come thronging\r\nto his mind which it is given to few men to know. He lingered there\r\ntwo days, and then pressing on again, was in Williamsburg on the 14th,\r\nand on the 17th went on board the Ville de Paris to congratulate De\r\nGrasse on his victory, and to concert measures for the siege.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was most agreeable. All had gone well, all promised well,\r\nand everything was smiling and harmonious. Yet they were on the eve\r\nof the greatest peril which occurred in the campaign. Washington\r\nhad managed to scrape together enough transports; but his almost\r\nunassisted labors had taken time, and delay had followed. Then the\r\ntransports were slow, and winds and tides were uncertain, and there\r\nwas further delay. The interval permitted De Grasse to hear that the\r\nBritish fleet had received reinforcements, and to become nervous in\r\nconsequence. He wanted to get out to sea; the season was advancing,\r\nand he was anxious to return to the West Indies; and above all he\r\ndid not wish to fight in the bay. He therefore proposed firmly and\r\nvigorously to leave two ships in the river, and stand out to sea with\r\nhis fleet. The Yorktown campaign began to look as if it had reached\r\nits conclusion. Once again Washington wrote one of his masterly\r\nletters of expostulation and remonstrance, and once more he prevailed,\r\naided by the reasoning and appeals of Lafayette, who carried the\r\nmessage. De Grasse consented to stay, and Washington, grateful beyond\r\nmeasure, wrote him that \"a great mind knows how to make personal\r\nsacrifice to secure an important general good.\" Under the\r\ncircumstances, and in view of the general truth of this complimentary\r\nsentiment, one cannot help rejoicing that De Grasse had \"a great\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nAt all events he stayed, and thereafter everything went well. The\r\nnorthern army landed at Williamsburg and marched for Yorktown on the\r\n28th. They reconnoitred the outlying works the next day, and prepared\r\nfor an immediate assault; but in the night Cornwallis abandoned all\r\nhis outside works and withdrew into the town. Washington thereupon\r\nadvanced at once, and prepared for the siege. On the night of the 5th,\r\nthe trenches were opened only six hundred yards from the enemy's line,\r\nand in three days the first parallel was completed. On the 11th the\r\nsecond parallel was begun, and on the 14th the American batteries\r\nplayed on the two advanced redoubts with such effect that the breaches\r\nwere pronounced practicable. Washington at once ordered an assault.\r\nThe smaller redoubt was stormed by the Americans under Hamilton and\r\ntaken in ten minutes. The other, larger and more strongly garrisoned,\r\nwas carried by the French with equal gallantry, after half an hour's\r\nfighting. During the assault Washington stood in an embrasure of the\r\ngrand battery watching the advance of the men. He was always given to\r\nexposing himself recklessly when there was fighting to be done, but\r\nnot when he was only an observer. This night, however, he was much\r\nexposed to the enemy's fire. One of his aides, anxious and disturbed\r\nfor his safety, told him that the place was perilous. \"If you think\r\nso,\" was the quiet answer, \"you are at liberty to step back.\" The\r\nmoment was too exciting, too fraught with meaning, to think of peril.\r\nThe old fighting spirit of Braddock's field was unchained for the last\r\ntime. He would have liked to head the American assault, sword in hand,\r\nand as he could not do that he stood as near his troops as he could,\r\nutterly regardless of the bullets whistling in the air about him. Who\r\ncan wonder at his intense excitement at that moment? Others saw a\r\nbrilliant storming of two outworks, but to Washington the whole\r\nRevolution, and all the labor and thought and conflict of six years\r\nwere culminating in the smoke and din on those redoubts, while out of\r\nthe dust and heat of the sharp quick fight success was coming. He\r\nhad waited long, and worked hard, and his whole soul went out as he\r\nwatched the troops cross the abattis and scale the works. He could\r\nhave no thought of danger then, and when all was over he turned to\r\nKnox and said, \"The work is done, and well done. Bring me my horse.\"\r\n\r\nWashington was not mistaken. The work was indeed done. Tarleton early\r\nin the siege had dashed out against Lauzun on the other side of the\r\nriver and been repulsed. Cornwallis had been forced back steadily into\r\nthe town, and his redoubts, as soon as taken, were included in the\r\nsecond parallel. A sortie to retake the redoubts failed, and a wild\r\nattempt to transport the army across the river was stopped by a gale\r\nof wind. On the 17th Cornwallis was compelled to face much bloody and\r\nuseless slaughter, or to surrender. He chose the latter course, and\r\nafter opening negotiations and trying in vain to obtain delay, finally\r\nsigned the capitulation and gave up the town. The next day the troops\r\nmarched out and laid down their arms. Over 7000 British and Hessian\r\ntroops surrendered. It was a crushing defeat. The victorious army\r\nconsisted in round numbers of 5500 continentals, 3500 militia, and\r\n7000 French, and they were backed by the French fleet with entire\r\ncontrol of the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington had once reached Yorktown with his fleet and army, the\r\ncampaign was really at an end, for he held Cornwallis in an iron grip\r\nfrom which there was no escape. The masterly part of the Yorktown\r\ncampaign lay in the manner in which it was brought about, in the\r\nmanagement of so many elements, and in the rapidity of movement which\r\ncarried an army without any proper supplies or means of transportation\r\nfrom New York to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. The control of the sea\r\nhad been the great advantage of the British from the beginning, and\r\nhad enabled them to achieve all that they ever gained. With these odds\r\nagainst him, with no possibility of obtaining a fleet of his own,\r\nWashington saw that his only chance of bringing the war to a quick and\r\nsuccessful issue was by means of the French. It is difficult to manage\r\nallied troops. It is still more difficult to manage allied troops and\r\nan allied fleet. Washington did both with infinite address, and won.\r\nThe chief factor of his success in this direction lay in his profound\r\npersonal influence on all men with whom he came in contact. His\r\ncourtesy and tact were perfect, but he made no concessions, and\r\nnever stooped. The proudest French noble who came here shrank from\r\ndisagreement with the American general, and yet not one of them had\r\nanything but admiration and respect to express when they wrote of\r\nWashington in their memoirs, diaries, and letters. He impressed them\r\none and all with a sense of power and greatness which could not\r\nbe disregarded. Many times he failed to get the French fleet in\r\ncoöperation, but finally it came. Then he put forth all his influence\r\nand all his address, and thus he got De Barras to the Chesapeake, and\r\nkept De Grasse at Yorktown.\r\n\r\nThis was one side of the problem, the most essential because\r\neverything hinged on the fleet, but by no means the most harassing.\r\nThe doubt about the control of the sea made it impossible to work\r\nsteadily for a sufficient time toward any one end. It was necessary to\r\nhave a plan for every contingency, and be ready to adopt any one of\r\nseveral plans at short notice. With a foresight and judgment that\r\nnever failed, Washington planned an attack on New York, another on\r\nYorktown, and a third on Charleston. The division of the British\r\nforces gave him his opportunity of striking at one point with an\r\noverwhelming force, but there was always the possibility of their\r\nsuddenly reuniting. In the extreme south he felt reasonably sure that\r\nGreene would hold Rawdon, but he was obliged to deceive and amuse\r\nClinton, and at the same time, with a ridiculously inferior force,\r\nto keep Cornwallis from marching to South Carolina. Partly by good\r\nfortune, partly by skill, Cornwallis was kept in Virginia, while by\r\nadmirably managed feints and threats Clinton was held in New York in\r\ninactivity. When the decisive moment came, and it was evident that the\r\ncontrol of the sea was to be determined in the Chesapeake, Washington,\r\noverriding all sorts of obstacles, moved forward, despite a bankrupt\r\nand inert government, with a rapidity and daring which have been\r\nrarely equaled. It was a bold stroke to leave Clinton behind at the\r\nmouth of the Hudson, and only the quickness with which it was done,\r\nand the careful deception which had been practiced, made it possible.\r\nOnce at Yorktown, there was little more to do. The combination was\r\nso perfect, and the judgment had been so sure, that Cornwallis was\r\ncrushed as helplessly as if he had been thrown before the car of\r\nJuggernaut. There was really but little fighting, for there was no\r\nopportunity to fight. Washington held the British in a vice, and the\r\nutter helplessness of Cornwallis, the entire inability of such a good\r\nand gallant soldier even to struggle, are the most convincing proofs\r\nof the military genius of his antagonist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nFortitude in misfortune is more common than composure in the hour\r\nof victory. The bitter medicine of defeat, however unpalatable,\r\nis usually extremely sobering, but the strong new wine of success\r\ngenerally sets the heads of poor humanity spinning, and leads often to\r\nworse results than folly. The capture of Cornwallis was enough to have\r\nturned the strongest head, for the moment at least, but it had no\r\napparent effect upon the man who had brought it to pass, and who, more\r\nthan any one else, knew what it meant. Unshaken and undismayed in the\r\nNew Jersey winter, and among the complicated miseries of Valley Forge,\r\nWashington turned from the spectacle of a powerful British army laying\r\ndown their arms as coolly as if he had merely fought a successful\r\nskirmish, or repelled a dangerous raid. He had that rare gift, the\r\nattribute of the strongest minds, of leaving the past to take care of\r\nitself. He never fretted over what could not be undone, nor dallied\r\namong pleasant memories while aught still remained to do. He wrote to\r\nCongress in words of quiet congratulation, through which pierced the\r\ndevout and solemn sense of the great deed accomplished, and then,\r\nwhile the salvos of artillery were still booming in his ears, and the\r\nshouts of victory were still rising about him, he set himself, after\r\nhis fashion, to care for the future and provide for the immediate\r\ncompletion of his work.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to De Grasse, urging him to join in an immediate movement\r\nagainst Charleston, such as he had already suggested, and he presented\r\nin the strongest terms the opportunities now offered for the sudden\r\nand complete ending of the struggle. But the French admiral was by no\r\nmeans imbued with the tireless and determined spirit of Washington. He\r\nhad had his fill even of victory, and was so eager to get back to the\r\nWest Indies, where he was to fall a victim to Rodney, that he would\r\nnot even transport troops to Wilmington. Thus deprived of the force\r\nwhich alone made comprehensive and extended movements possible,\r\nWashington returned, as he had done so often before, to making the\r\nbest of cramped circumstances and straitened means. He sent all the\r\ntroops he could spare to Greene, to help him in wresting the southern\r\nStates from the enemy, the work to which he had in vain summoned De\r\nGrasse. This done, he prepared to go north. On his way he was stopped\r\nat Eltham by the illness and death of his wife's son, John Custis, a\r\nblow which he felt severely, and which saddened the great victory he\r\nhad just achieved. Still the business of the State could not wait on\r\nprivate grief. He left the house of mourning, and, pausing for an\r\ninstant only at Mount Vernon, hastened on to Philadelphia. At the\r\nvery moment of victory, and while honorable members were shaking each\r\nother's hands and congratulating each other that the war was now\r\nreally over, the commander-in-chief had fallen again to writing them\r\nletters in the old strain, and was once more urging them to keep up\r\nthe army, while he himself gave his personal attention to securing a\r\nnaval force for the ensuing year, through the medium of Lafayette.\r\nNothing was ever finished with Washington until it was really complete\r\nthroughout, and he had as little time for rejoicing as he had for\r\ndespondency or despair, while a British force still remained in the\r\ncountry. He probably felt that this was as untoward a time as he had\r\never met in a pretty large experience of unsuitable occasions, for\r\noffering sound advice, but he was not deterred thereby from doing it.\r\nThis time, however, he was destined to an agreeable disappointment,\r\nfor on his arrival at Philadelphia he found an excellent spirit\r\nprevailing in Congress. That body was acting cheerfully on his advice,\r\nit had filled the departments of the government, and set on foot such\r\nmeasures as it could to keep up the army. So Washington remained for\r\nsome time at Philadelphia, helping and counseling Congress in its\r\nwork, and writing to the States vigorous letters, demanding pay and\r\nclothing for the soldiers, ever uppermost in his thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut although Congress was compliant, Washington could not convince\r\nthe country of the justice of his views, and of the continued need of\r\nenergetic exertion. The steady relaxation of tone, which the strain of\r\na long and trying war had produced, was accelerated by the brilliant\r\nvictory of Yorktown. Washington for his own part had but little trust\r\nin the sense or the knowledge of his enemy. He felt that Yorktown was\r\ndecisive, but he also thought that Great Britain would still struggle\r\non, and that her talk of peace was very probably a mere blind, to\r\nenable her to gain time, and, by taking advantage of our relaxed and\r\nfeeble condition, to strike again in hope of winning back all that had\r\nbeen lost. He therefore continued his appeals in behalf of the\r\narmy, and reiterated everywhere the necessity for fresh and ample\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nAs late as May 4 he wrote sharply to the States for men and money,\r\nsaying that the change of ministry was likely to be adverse to\r\npeace, and that we were being lulled into a false and fatal sense of\r\nsecurity. A few days later, on receiving information from Sir Guy\r\nCarleton of the address of the Commons to the king for peace,\r\nWashington wrote to Congress: \"For my own part, I view our situation\r\nas such that, instead of relaxing, we ought to improve the present\r\nmoment as the most favorable to our wishes. The British nation\r\nappear to me to be staggered, and almost ready to sink beneath the\r\naccumulating weight of debt and misfortune. If we follow the blow with\r\nvigor and energy, I think the game is our own.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote in July: \"Sir Guy Carleton is using every art to\r\nsoothe and lull our people into a state of security. Admiral Digby\r\nis capturing all our vessels, and suffocating as fast as possible in\r\nprison-ships all our seamen who will not enlist into the service of\r\nhis Britannic Majesty; and Haldimand, with his savage allies, is\r\nscalping and burning on the frontiers.\" Facts always were the object\r\nof Washington's first regard, and while gentlemen on all sides were\r\ntalking of peace, war was going on, and he could not understand the\r\nsupineness which would permit our seamen to be suffocated, and our\r\nborderers scalped, because some people thought the war ought to be and\r\npractically was over. While the other side was fighting, he wished to\r\nbe fighting too. A month later he wrote to Greene: \"From the former\r\ninfatuation, duplicity, and perverse system of British policy, I\r\nconfess I am induced to doubt everything, to suspect everything.\" He\r\ncould say heartily with the Trojan priest, \"Quicquid id est timeo\r\nDanaos et dona ferentes.\" Yet again, a month later still, when the\r\nnegotiations were really going forward in Paris, he wrote to McHenry:\r\n\"If we are wise, let us prepare for the worst. There is nothing which\r\nwill so soon produce a speedy and honorable peace as a state of\r\npreparation for war; and we must either do this, or lay our account to\r\npatch up an inglorious peace, after all the toil, blood, and treasure\r\nwe have spent.\"\r\n\r\nNo man had done and given so much as Washington, and at the same\r\ntime no other man had his love of thoroughness, and his indomitable\r\nfighting temper. He found few sympathizers, his words fell upon deaf\r\nears, and he was left to struggle on and maintain his ground as best\r\nhe might, without any substantial backing. As it turned out, England\r\nwas more severely wounded than he dared to hope, and her desire for\r\npeace was real. But Washington's distrust and the active policy which\r\nhe urged were, in the conditions of the moment, perfectly sound,\r\nboth in a military and a political point of view. It made no real\r\ndifference, however, whether he was right or wrong in his opinion.\r\nHe could not get what he wanted, and he was obliged to drag through\r\nanother year, fettered in his military movements, and oppressed with\r\nanxiety for the future. He longed to drive the British from New York,\r\nand was forced to content himself, as so often before, with keeping\r\nhis army in existence. It was a trying time, and fruitful in nothing\r\nbut anxious forebodings. All the fighting was confined to skirmishes\r\nof outposts, and his days were consumed in vain efforts to obtain help\r\nfrom the States, while he watched with painful eagerness the current\r\nof events in Europe, down which the fortunes of his country were\r\nfeebly drifting.\r\n\r\nAmong the petty incidents of the year there was one which, in its\r\neffects, gained an international importance, which has left a deep\r\nstain upon the English arms, and which touched Washington deeply.\r\nCaptain Huddy, an American officer, was captured in a skirmish and\r\ncarried to New York, where he was placed in confinement. Thence he\r\nwas taken on April 12 by a party of Tories in the British service,\r\ncommanded by Captain Lippencott, and hanged in the broad light of day\r\non the heights near Middletown. Testimony and affidavits to the\r\nfact, which was never questioned, were duly gathered and laid before\r\nWashington. The deed was one of wanton barbarity, for which it would\r\nbe difficult to find a parallel in the annals of modern warfare.\r\nThe authors of this brutal murder, to our shame be it said, were of\r\nAmerican birth, but they were fighting for the crown and wore the\r\nBritish uniform. England, which for generations has deafened the\r\nworld with paeans of praise for her own love of fair play and for\r\nher generous humanity, stepped in here and threw the mantle of her\r\nprotection over these cowardly hangmen. It has not been uncommon for\r\nwild North American savages to deliver up criminals to the vengeance\r\nof the law, but English ministers and officers condoned the murder of\r\nHuddy, and sheltered his murderers.\r\n\r\nWhen the case was laid before Washington it stirred him to the deepest\r\nwrath. He submitted the facts to twenty-five of his general officers,\r\nwho unanimously advised what he was himself determined upon, instant\r\nretaliation. He wrote at once to Sir Guy Carleton, and informed him\r\nthat unless the murderers were given up he should be compelled to\r\nretaliate. Carleton replied that a court-martial was ordered, and some\r\nattempt was made to recriminate; but Washington pressed on in the path\r\nhe had marked out, and had an English officer selected by lot and held\r\nin close confinement to await the action of the enemy. These sharp\r\nmeasures brought the British, as nothing else could have done, to some\r\nsense of the enormity of the crime that had been committed. Sir Guy\r\nCarleton wrote in remonstrance, and Washington replied: \"Ever since\r\nthe commencement of this unnatural war my conduct has borne invariable\r\ntestimony against those inhuman excesses, which, in too many\r\ninstances, have marked its progress. With respect to a late\r\ntransaction, to which I presume your excellency alludes, I have\r\nalready expressed my resolution, a resolution formed on the most\r\nmature deliberation, and from which I shall not recede.\" The\r\naffair dragged along, purposely protracted by the British, and the\r\ncourt-martial on a technical point acquitted Lippencott. Sir Guy\r\nCarleton, however, who really was deeply indignant at the outrage,\r\nwrote, expressing his abhorrence, disavowed Lippencott, and promised\r\na further inquiry. This placed Washington in a very trying position,\r\nmore especially as his humanity was touched by the situation of the\r\nunlucky hostage. The fatal lot had fallen upon a mere boy, Captain\r\nAsgill, who was both amiable and popular, and Washington was beset\r\nwith appeals in his behalf, for Lady Asgill moved heaven and earth to\r\nsave her son. She interested the French court, and Vergennes made a\r\nspecial request that Asgill should be released. Even Washington's own\r\nofficers, notably Hamilton, sought to influence him, and begged him to\r\nrecede. In these difficult circumstances, which were enhanced by the\r\nfact that contrary to his orders to select an unconditional prisoner,\r\nthe lot had fallen on a Yorktown prisoner protected by the terms\r\nof the capitulation,[1] he hesitated, and asked instructions from\r\nCongress. He wrote to Duane in September: \"While retaliation was\r\napparently necessary, however disagreeable in itself, I had no\r\nrepugnance to the measure. But when the end proposed by it is answered\r\nby a disavowal of the act, by a dissolution of the board of refugees,\r\nand by a promise (whether with or without meaning to comply with it, I\r\nshall not determine) that further inquisition should be made into the\r\nmatter, I thought it incumbent upon me, before I proceeded any farther\r\nin the matter, to have the sense of Congress, who had most explicitly\r\napproved and impliedly indeed ordered retaliation to take place. To\r\nthis hour I am held in darkness.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MS, letter to Lincoln.]\r\n\r\nHe did not long remain in doubt. The fact was that the public, as is\r\ncommonly the case, had forgotten the original crime and saw only the\r\nmisery of the man who was to pay the just penalty, and who was, in\r\nthis instance, an innocent and vicarious sufferer. It was difficult\r\nto refuse Vergennes, and Congress, glad of the excuse and anxious to\r\noblige their allies, ordered the release of Asgill. That Washington,\r\ntouched by the unhappy condition of his prisoner, did not feel\r\nrelieved by the result, it would be absurd to suppose. But he was by\r\nno means satisfied, for the murderous wrong that had been done rankled\r\nin his breast. He wrote to Vergennes: \"Captain Asgill has been\r\nreleased, and is at perfect liberty to return to the arms of an\r\naffectionate parent, whose pathetic address to your Excellency could\r\nnot fail of interesting every feeling heart in her behalf. I have no\r\nright to assume any particular merit from the lenient manner in which\r\nthis disagreeable affair has terminated.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a perfect honesty about this which is very wholesome. He had\r\nbeen freely charged with cruelty, and had regarded the accusation with\r\nindifference. Now, when it was easy for him to have taken the glory\r\nof mercy by simply keeping silent, he took pains to avow that the\r\nleniency was not due to him. He was not satisfied, and no one should\r\nbelieve that he was, even if the admission seemed to justify the\r\ncharge of cruelty. If he erred at all it was in not executing some\r\nBritish officer at the very start, unless Lippencott had been given up\r\nwithin a limited time. As it was, after delay was once permitted, it\r\nis hard to see how he could have acted otherwise than he did, but\r\nWashington was not in the habit of receding from a fixed purpose, and\r\nbeing obliged to do so in this case troubled him, for he knew that he\r\ndid well to be angry. But the frankness of the avowal to Vergennes is\r\na good example of his entire honesty and absolute moral fearlessness.\r\n\r\nThe matter, however, which most filled his heart and mind during these\r\nweary days of waiting and doubt was the condition and the future of\r\nhis soldiers. To those persons who have suspected or suggested that\r\nWashington was cold-blooded and unmindful of others, the letters he\r\nwrote in regard to the soldiers may be commended. The man whose heart\r\nwas wrung by the sufferings of the poor people on the Virginian\r\nfrontier, in the days of the old French war, never in fact changed\r\nhis nature. Fierce in fight, passionate and hot when his anger was\r\nstirred, his love and sympathy were keen and strong toward his army.\r\nHis heart went out to the brave men who had followed him, loved him,\r\nand never swerved in their loyalty to him and to their country.\r\nWashington's affection for his men, and their devotion to him, had\r\nsaved the cause of American independence more often than strategy or\r\ndaring. Now, when the war was practically over, his influence with\r\nboth officers and soldiers was destined to be put to its severest\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThe people of the American colonies were self-governing in the\r\nextremest sense, that is, they were accustomed to very little\r\ngovernment interference of any sort. They were also poor and entirely\r\nunused to war. Suddenly they found themselves plunged into a bitter\r\nand protracted conflict with the most powerful of civilized nations.\r\nIn the first flush of excitement, patriotic enthusiasm supplied many\r\ndefects; but as time wore on, and year after year passed, and the\r\nwhole social and political fabric was shaken, the moral tone of the\r\npeople relaxed. In such a struggle, coming upon an unprepared people\r\nof the habits and in the circumstances of the colonists, this\r\nrelaxation was inevitable. It was likewise inevitable that, as the war\r\ncontinued, there should be in both national and state governments, and\r\nin all directions, many shortcomings and many lamentable errors. But\r\nfor the treatment accorded the army, no such excuse can be made, and\r\nno sufficient explanation can be offered. There was throughout the\r\ncolonies an inborn and a carefully cultivated dread of standing armies\r\nand military power. But this very natural feeling was turned most\r\nunreasonably against our own army, and carried in that direction to\r\nthe verge of insanity. This jealousy of military power indeed pursued\r\nWashington from the beginning to the end of the Revolution. It cropped\r\nout as soon as he was appointed, and came up in one form or another\r\nwhenever he was obliged to take strong measures. Even at the very end,\r\nafter he had borne the cause through to triumph, Congress was driven\r\nalmost to frenzy because Vergennes proposed to commit the disposition\r\nof a French subsidy to the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nIf this feeling could show itself toward Washington, it is easy to\r\nimagine that it was not restrained toward his officers and men, and\r\nthe treatment of the soldiers by Congress and by the States was not\r\nonly ungrateful to the last degree, but was utterly unpardonable.\r\nAgain and again the menace of immediate ruin and the stern demands of\r\nWashington alone extorted the most grudging concessions, and saved the\r\narmy from dissolution. The soldiers had every reason to think that\r\nnothing but personal fear could obtain the barest consideration from\r\nthe civil power. In this frame of mind, they saw the war which they\r\nhad fought and won drawing to a close with no prospect of either\r\nprovision or reward for them, and every indication that they would be\r\ndisbanded when they were no longer needed, and left in many cases\r\nto beggary and want. In the inaction consequent upon the victory at\r\nYorktown, they had ample time to reflect upon these facts, and their\r\nreflections were of such a nature that the situation soon became\r\ndangerous. Washington, who had struggled in season and out of season\r\nfor justice to the soldiers, labored more zealously than ever during\r\nall this period, aided vigorously by Hamilton, who was now in\r\nCongress. Still nothing was done, and in October, 1782, he wrote to\r\nthe Secretary of War in words warm with indignant feeling: \"While I\r\npremise that no one I have seen or heard of appears opposed to the\r\nprinciple of reducing the army as circumstances may require, yet I\r\ncannot help fearing the result of the measure in contemplation, under\r\npresent circumstances, when I see such a number of men, goaded by a\r\nthousand stings of reflection on the past and of anticipation on the\r\nfuture, about to be turned into the world, soured by penury and what\r\nthey call the ingratitude of the public, involved in debts, without\r\none farthing of money to carry them home after having spent the flower\r\nof their days, and many of them their patrimonies, in establishing the\r\nfreedom and independence of their country, and suffered everything\r\nthat human nature is capable of enduring on this side of death.... You\r\nmay rely upon it, the patriotism and long-suffering of this army\r\nare almost exhausted, and that there never was so great a spirit of\r\ndiscontent as at this instant. While in the field I think it may be\r\nkept from breaking into acts of outrage; but when we retire into\r\nwinter-quarters, unless the storm is previously dissipated, I cannot\r\nbe at ease respecting the consequences. It is high time for a peace.\"\r\n\r\nThese were grave words, coming from such a man as Washington, but they\r\npassed unheeded. Congress and the States went blandly along as if\r\neverything was all right, and as if the army had no grievances. But\r\nthe soldiers thought differently. \"Dissatisfactions rose to a great\r\nand alarming height, and combinations among officers to resign at\r\ngiven periods in a body were beginning to take place.\" The outlook\r\nwas so threatening that Washington, who had intended to go to Mount\r\nVernon, remained in camp, and by management and tact thwarted these\r\ncombinations and converted these dangerous movements into an address\r\nto Congress from the officers, asking for half-pay, arrearages, and\r\nsome other equally proper concessions. Still Congress did not stir.\r\nSome indefinite resolutions were passed, but nothing was done as to\r\nthe commutation of half-pay into a fixed sum, and after such a display\r\nof indifference the dissatisfaction increased rapidly, and the army\r\nbecame more and more restless. In March a call was issued for a\r\nmeeting of officers, and an anonymous address, written with\r\nmuch skill,--the work, as afterwards appeared, of Major John\r\nArmstrong,--was published at the same time. The address was well\r\ncalculated to inflame the passions of the troops; it advised a resort\r\nto force, and was scattered broadcast through the camp. The army was\r\nnow in a ferment, and the situation was full of peril. A weak man\r\nwould have held his peace; a rash one would have tried to suppress the\r\nmeeting. Washington did neither, but quietly took control of the whole\r\nmovement himself. In general orders he censured the call and the\r\naddress as irregular, and then appointed a time and place for the\r\nmeeting. Another anonymous address thereupon appeared, quieter in\r\ntone, but congratulating the army on the recognition accorded by the\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers assembled, Washington arose with a manuscript in\r\nhis hand, and as he took out his glasses said, simply, \"You see,\r\ngentlemen, I have grown both blind and gray in your service.\" His\r\naddress was brief, calm, and strong. The clear, vigorous sentences\r\nwere charged with meaning and with deep feeling. He exhorted them one\r\nand all, both officers and men, to remain loyal and obedient, true\r\nto their glorious past and to their country. He appealed to their\r\npatriotism, and promised them that which they had always had, his\r\nown earnest support in obtaining justice from Congress. When he had\r\nfinished he quietly withdrew. The officers were deeply moved by\r\nhis words, and his influence prevailed. Resolutions were passed,\r\nreiterating the demands of the army, but professing entire faith in\r\nthe government. This time Congress listened, and the measures granting\r\nhalf-pay in commutation and certain other requests were passed. Thus\r\nthis very serious danger was averted, not by the reluctant action of\r\nCongress, but by the wisdom and strength of the general, who was loved\r\nby his soldiers after a fashion that few conquerors could boast.\r\n\r\nUnderlying all these general discontents, there was, besides, a\r\nwell-defined movement, which saw a solution of all difficulties and a\r\nredress of all wrongs in a radical change of the form of government,\r\nand in the elevation of Washington to supreme power. This party was\r\nsatisfied that the existing system was a failure, and that it was\r\nnot and could not be made either strong, honest, or respectable. The\r\nobvious relief was in some kind of monarchy, with a large infusion of\r\nthe one-man power; and it followed, as a matter of course, that the\r\none man could be no other than the commander-in-chief. In May, 1782,\r\nwhen the feeling in the army had risen very high, this party of reform\r\nbrought their ideas before Washington through an old and respected\r\nfriend of his, Colonel Nicola. The colonel set forth very clearly the\r\nfailure and shortcomings of the existing government, argued in favor\r\nof the substitution of something much stronger, and wound up by\r\nhinting very plainly that his correspondent was the man for the crisis\r\nand the proper savior of society. The letter was forcible and well\r\nwritten, and Colonel Nicola was a man of character and standing. It\r\ncould not be passed over lightly or in silence, and Washington replied\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"With a mixture of surprise and astonishment, I have read with\r\nattention the sentiments you have submitted to my perusal. Be assured,\r\nsir, no occurrence in the course of the war has given me more painful\r\nsensations than your information of there being such ideas existing\r\nin the army as you have expressed, and [which] I must view with\r\nabhorrence and reprehend with severity. For the present, the\r\ncommunication of them will rest in my own bosom, unless some further\r\nagitation of the matter shall make a disclosure necessary. I am\r\nmuch at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given\r\nencouragement to an address which seems to me big with the greatest\r\nmischiefs that can befall my country. If I am not deceived in the\r\nknowledge of myself, you could not have found a person to whom your\r\nschemes are more disagreeable. At the same time, in justice to my own\r\nfeelings, I must add that no man possesses a more sincere wish to\r\nsee justice done to the army than I do; and as far as my power and\r\ninfluence in a constitutional way extend, they shall be employed to\r\nthe utmost of my abilities to effect it, should there be any occasion.\r\nLet me conjure you, then, if you have any regard for your country,\r\nconcern for yourself or posterity, or respect for me, to banish these\r\nthoughts from your mind, and never communicate, as from yourself or\r\nany one else, a sentiment of the like nature.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple but exceedingly plain letter checked the whole movement\r\nat once; but the feeling of hostility to the existing system of\r\ngovernment and of confidence in Washington increased steadily through\r\nthe summer and winter. When the next spring had come round, and the\r\n\"Newburgh addresses\" had been published, the excitement was at fever\r\nheat. All the army needed was a leader. It was as easy for Washington\r\nto have grasped supreme power then, as it would have been for Cæsar\r\nto have taken the crown from Antony upon the Lupercal. He repelled\r\nNicola's suggestion with quiet reproof, and took the actual movement,\r\nwhen it reared its head, into his own hands and turned it into other\r\nchannels. This incident has been passed over altogether too carelessly\r\nby historians and biographers. It has generally been used merely to\r\nshow the general nobility of Washington's sentiments, and no proper\r\nstress has been laid upon the facts of the time which gave birth to\r\nsuch an idea and such a proposition. It would have been a perfectly\r\nfeasible thing at that particular moment to have altered the frame of\r\ngovernment and placed the successful soldier in possession of supreme\r\npower. The notion of kingly government was, of course, entirely\r\nfamiliar to everybody, and had in itself nothing repulsive. The\r\nconfederation was disintegrated, the States were demoralized, and the\r\nwhole social and political life was weakened. The army was the one\r\ncoherent, active, and thoroughly organized body in the country. Six\r\nyears of war had turned them from militia into seasoned veterans, and\r\nthey stood armed and angry, ready to respond to the call of the great\r\nleader to whom they were entirely devoted. When the English troops\r\nwere once withdrawn, there was nothing on the continent that could\r\nhave stood against them. If they had moved, they would have been\r\neverywhere supported by their old comrades who had returned to the\r\nranks of civil life, by all the large class who wanted peace and order\r\nin the quickest and surest way, and by the timid and tired generally.\r\nThere would have been in fact no serious opposition, probably because\r\nthere would have been no means of sustaining it.\r\n\r\nThe absolute feebleness of the general government was shown a few\r\nweeks later, when a recently recruited regiment of Pennsylvania troops\r\nmutinied, and obliged Congress to leave Philadelphia, unable either to\r\ndefend themselves or procure defense from the State. This mutiny was\r\nput down suddenly and effectively by Washington, very wroth at the\r\ninsubordination of raw troops, who had neither fought nor suffered.\r\nYet even such mutineers as these would have succeeded in a large\r\nmeasure, had it not been for Washington, and one can easily imagine\r\nfrom this incident the result of disciplined and well-planned action\r\non the part of the army led by their great chief. In that hour of\r\ndebility and relaxation, a military seizure of the government and\r\nthe erection of some form of monarchy would not have been difficult.\r\nWhether such a change would have lasted is another question, but there\r\nis no reason to doubt that at the moment it might have been effected.\r\nWashington, however, not only refused to have anything to do with the\r\nscheme, but he used the personal loyalty which might have raised him\r\nto supreme power to check all dangerous movements and put in motion\r\nthe splendid and unselfish patriotism for which the army was\r\nconspicuous, and which underlay all their irritations and discontents.\r\n\r\nThe obvious view of Washington's action in this crisis as a remarkable\r\nexhibition of patriotism is at best somewhat superficial. In a man in\r\nany way less great, the letter of refusal to Nicola and the treatment\r\nof the opportunity presented at the time of the Newburgh addresses\r\nwould have been fine in a high degree. In Washington they were not so\r\nextraordinary, for the situation offered him no temptation. Carlyle\r\nwas led to think slightingly of Washington, one may believe, because\r\nhe did not seize the tottering government with a strong hand, and\r\nbring order out of chaos on the instant. But this is a woeful\r\nmisunderstanding of the man. To put aside a crown for love of country\r\nis noble, but to look down upon such an opportunity indicates a much\r\ngreater loftiness and strength of mind. Washington was wholly free\r\nfrom the vulgar ambition of the usurper, and the desire of mere\r\npersonal aggrandizement found no place in his nature. His ruling\r\npassion was the passion for success, and for thorough and complete\r\nsuccess. What he could not bear was the least shadow of failure. To\r\nhave fought such a war to a victorious finish, and then turned it to\r\nhis own advantage, would have been to him failure of the meanest\r\nkind. He fought to free the colonies from England, and make them\r\nindependent, not to play the part of a Cæsar or a Cromwell in the\r\nwreck and confusion of civil war. He flung aside the suggestion of\r\nsupreme power, not simply as dishonorable and unpatriotic, but because\r\nsuch a result would have defeated the one great and noble object\r\nat which he aimed. Nor did he act in this way through any indolent\r\nshrinking from the great task of making what he had won worth winning,\r\nby crushing the forces of anarchy and separation, and bringing order\r\nand unity out of confusion. From the surrender of Yorktown to the\r\nday of his retirement from the Presidency, he worked unceasingly to\r\nestablish union and strong government in the country he had made\r\nindependent. He accomplished this great labor more successfully\r\nby honest and lawful methods than if he had taken the path of the\r\nstrong-handed savior of society, and his work in this field did more\r\nfor the welfare of his country than all his battles. To have restored\r\norder at the head of the army was much easier than to effect it in the\r\nslow and law-abiding fashion which he adopted. To have refused supreme\r\nrule, and then to have effected in the spirit and under the forms\r\nof free government all and more than the most brilliant of military\r\nchiefs could have achieved by absolute power, is a glory which belongs\r\nto Washington alone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at that particular juncture it was, as he himself had\r\nsaid, \"high time for a peace.\" The danger at Newburgh had been averted\r\nby his commanding influence and the patriotic conduct of the army. But\r\nit had been averted only, not removed. The snake was scotched, not\r\nkilled. The finishing stroke was still needed in the form of an end to\r\nhostilities, and it was therefore fortunate for the United States that\r\na fortnight later, on March 23, news came that a general treaty\r\nof peace had been signed. This final consummation of his work, in\r\naddition to the passage by Congress of the half-pay commutation and\r\nthe settlement of the army accounts, filled Washington with deep\r\nrejoicing. He felt that in a short time, a few weeks at most, he would\r\nbe free to withdraw to the quiet life at Mount Vernon for which he\r\nlonged. But public bodies move slowly, and one delay after another\r\noccurred to keep him still in the harness. He chafed under the\r\npostponement, but it was not possible to him to remain idle even when\r\nhe awaited in almost daily expectation the hour of dismissal. He saw\r\nwith the instinctive glance of statesmanship that the dangerous point\r\nin the treaty of peace was in the provisions as to the western posts\r\non the one side, and those relating to British debts on the other. A\r\nmonth therefore had not passed before he brought to the attention\r\nof Congress the importance of getting immediate possession of those\r\nposts, and a little later he succeeded in having Steuben sent out as a\r\nspecial envoy to obtain their surrender. The mission was vain, as he\r\nhad feared. He was not destined to extract this thorn for many years,\r\nand then only after many trials and troubles. Soon afterward he made a\r\njourney with Governor Clinton to Ticonderoga, and along the valley of\r\nthe Mohawk, \"to wear away the time,\" as he wrote to Congress. He wore\r\naway time to more purpose than most people, for where he traveled he\r\nobserved closely, and his observations were lessons which he never\r\nforgot. On this trip he had the western posts and the Indians always\r\nin mind, and familiarized himself with the conditions of a part of the\r\ncountry where these matters were of great importance.\r\n\r\nOn his return he went to Princeton, where Congress had been sitting\r\nsince their flight from the mutiny which he had recently suppressed,\r\nand where a house had been provided for his use. He remained there two\r\nmonths, aiding Congress in their work. During the spring he had been\r\nengaged on the matter of a peace establishment, and he now gave\r\nCongress elaborate and well-matured advice on that question, and on\r\nthose of public lands, western settlement, and the best Indian policy.\r\nIn all these directions his views were clear, far-sighted, and wise.\r\nHe saw that in these questions was involved much of the future\r\ndevelopment and wellbeing of the country, and he treated them with a\r\nprecision and an easy mastery which showed the thought he had given to\r\nthe new problems which now were coming to the front. Unluckily, he was\r\nso far ahead, both in knowledge and perception, of the body with which\r\nhe dealt, that he could get little or nothing done, and in September\r\nhe wrote in plain but guarded terms of the incapacity of the\r\nlawmakers. The people were not yet ripe for his measures, and he was\r\nforced to bide his time, and see the injuries caused by indifference\r\nand short-sightedness work themselves out. Gradually, however, the\r\nabsolutely necessary business was brought to an end. Then Washington\r\nissued a circular letter to the governors of the States, which was\r\none of the ablest he ever wrote, and full of the profoundest\r\nstatesmanship, and he also sent out a touching address of farewell to\r\nthe army, eloquent with wisdom and with patriotism.\r\n\r\nFrom Princeton he went to West Point, where the army that still\r\nremained in service was stationed. Thence he moved to Harlem, and\r\non November 25 the British army departed, and Washington, with his\r\ntroops, accompanied by Governor Clinton and some regiments of local\r\nmilitia, marched in and took possession. This was the outward sign\r\nthat the war was over, and that American independence had been won.\r\nCarleton feared that the entry of the American army might be the\r\nsignal for confusion and violence, in which the Tory inhabitants would\r\nsuffer; but everything passed off with perfect tranquillity and good\r\norder, and in the evening Governor Clinton gave a public dinner to the\r\ncommander-in-chief and the officers of the army.\r\n\r\nAll was now over, and Washington prepared to go to Annapolis and lay\r\ndown his commission. On December 4 his officers assembled in Fraunces'\r\nTavern to bid him farewell. As he looked about on his faithful\r\nfriends, his usual self-command deserted him, and he could not control\r\nhis voice. Taking a glass of wine, he lifted it up, and said simply,\r\n\"With a heart full of love and gratitude I now take my leave of you,\r\nmost devoutly wishing that your latter days may be as prosperous and\r\nhappy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.\" The toast\r\nwas drunk in silence, and then Washington added, \"I cannot come to\r\neach of you and take my leave, but shall be obliged if you will come\r\nand take me by the hand.\" One by one they approached, and Washington\r\ngrasped the hand of each man and embraced him. His eyes were full of\r\ntears, and he could not trust himself to speak. In silence he bade\r\neach and all farewell, and then, accompanied by his officers, walked\r\nto Whitehall Ferry. Entering his barge, the word was given, and as\r\nthe oars struck the water he stood up and lifted his hat. In solemn\r\nsilence his officers returned the salute, and watched the noble and\r\ngracious figure of their beloved chief until the boat disappeared from\r\nsight behind the point of the Battery.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia he stopped a few days and adjusted his accounts, which\r\nhe had in characteristic fashion kept himself in the neatest and most\r\nmethodical way. He had drawn no pay, and had expended considerable\r\nsums from his private fortune, which he had omitted to charge to the\r\ngovernment. The gross amount of his expenses was about 15,000 pounds\r\nsterling, including secret service and other incidental outlays. In\r\nthese days of wild money-hunting, there is something worth pondering\r\nin this simple business settlement between a great general and his\r\ngovernment, at the close of eight years of war. This done, he started\r\nagain on his journey. From Philadelphia he proceeded to Annapolis,\r\ngreeted with addresses and hailed with shouts at every town and\r\nvillage on his route, and having reached his destination, he addressed\r\na letter to Congress on December 20, asking when it would be agreeable\r\nto them to receive him. The 23d was appointed, and on that day, at\r\nnoon, he appeared before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe following year a French orator and \"maître avocat,\" in an oration\r\ndelivered at Toulouse upon the American Revolution, described this\r\nscene in these words: \"On the day when Washington resigned his\r\ncommission in the hall of Congress, a crown decked with jewels was\r\nplaced upon the Book of the Constitutions. Suddenly Washington seizes\r\nit, breaks it, and flings the pieces to the assembled people. How\r\nsmall ambitious Cæsar seems beside the hero of America.\" It is worth\r\nwhile to recall this contemporary French description, because its\r\ntheatrical and dramatic untruth gives such point by contrast to the\r\nplain and dignified reality. The scene was the hall of Congress. The\r\nmembers representing the sovereign power were seated and covered,\r\nwhile all the space about was filled by the governor and state\r\nofficers of Maryland, by military officers, and by the ladies and\r\ngentlemen of the neighborhood, who stood in respectful silence with\r\nuncovered heads. Washington was introduced by the Secretary of\r\nCongress, and took a chair which had been assigned to him. There was\r\na brief pause, and then the president said that \"the United States\r\nin Congress assembled were prepared to receive his communication.\"\r\nWashington rose, and replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: The great events, on which my resignation depended,\r\nhaving at length taken place, I have now the honor of offering my\r\nsincere congratulations to Congress, and of presenting myself before\r\nthem, to surrender into their hands the trust committed to me, and to\r\nclaim the indulgence of retiring from the service of my country.\r\n\r\n\"Happy in the confirmation of our independence and sovereignty, and\r\npleased with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming\r\na respectable nation, I resign with satisfaction the appointment I\r\naccepted with diffidence; a diffidence in my abilities to accomplish\r\nso arduous a task, which, however, was superseded by a confidence in\r\nthe rectitude of our cause, the support of the supreme power of the\r\nUnion, and the patronage of Heaven. The successful termination of the\r\nwar has verified the most sanguine expectations; and my gratitude for\r\nthe interposition of Providence, and the assistance I have received\r\nfrom my countrymen, increases with every review of the momentous\r\ncontest.\" Then, after a word of gratitude to the army and to his\r\nstaff, he concluded as follows: \"I consider it an indispensable duty\r\nto close this last solemn act of my official life by commending the\r\ninterests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God,\r\nand those who have the superintendence of them to his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\"Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great\r\ntheatre of action; and bidding an affectionate farewell to this\r\naugust body, under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my\r\ncommission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.\"\r\n\r\nIn singularly graceful and eloquent words his old opponent, Thomas\r\nMifflin, the president, replied, the simple ceremony ended, and\r\nWashington left the room a private citizen.\r\n\r\nThe great master of English fiction, touching this scene with skillful\r\nhand, has said: \"Which was the most splendid spectacle ever witnessed,\r\nthe opening feast of Prince George in London, or the resignation\r\nof Washington? Which is the noble character for after ages to\r\nadmire,--yon fribble dancing in lace and spangles, or yonder hero\r\nwho sheathes his sword after a life of spotless honor, a purity\r\nunreproached, a courage indomitable, and a consummate victory?\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to say more. Comment or criticism on such a farewell,\r\nfrom such a man, at the close of a long civil war, would be not only\r\nsuperfluous but impertinent. The contemporary newspaper, in its meagre\r\naccount, said that the occasion was deeply solemn and affecting, and\r\nthat many persons shed tears. Well indeed might those then present\r\nhave been thus affected, for they had witnessed a scene memorable\r\nforever in the annals of all that is best and noblest in human nature.\r\nThey had listened to a speech which was not equaled in meaning and\r\nspirit in American history until, eighty years later, Abraham Lincoln\r\nstood upon the slopes of Gettysburg and uttered his immortal words\r\nupon those who died that the country might live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX for Volumes I & II\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACKERSON, DAVID,\r\n    describes Washington's personal appearance, ii. 386-388.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Abigail,\r\n    on Washington's appearance in 1775, i. 137.\r\n\r\n  Adams, John,\r\n    moves appointment of Washington as commander-in-chief, i. 134;\r\n    on political necessity for his appointment, 135;\r\n    and objections to it, 135;\r\n    statement as to Washington's difficulties, 163;\r\n    over-sanguine as to American prospects, 171;\r\n    finds fault with Washington, 214, 215;\r\n    one of few national statesmen, 252;\r\n    on Washington's opinion of titles, ii. 52;\r\n    advocates ceremony, 54;\r\n    returns to United States, 137;\r\n    attacked by Jefferson as a monarchist, 226;\r\n    praised by Democrats as superior to Washington, 251;\r\n    his administration upheld by Washington, 259;\r\n    advised by Washington, 260;\r\n    his inauguration, 276;\r\n    sends special mission to France, 284;\r\n    urges Washington to take command of provisional army, 285;\r\n    wishes to make Knox senior to Hamilton, 286;\r\n    censured by Washington, gives way, 287;\r\n    lack of sympathy with Washington, 287;\r\n    his nomination of Murray disapproved by Washington, 292, 293;\r\n    letter of Washington to, on immigration, 326.\r\n\r\n  Adams, J.Q.,\r\n    on weights and measures, ii. 81.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Samuel,\r\n    not sympathized with by Washington in working for independence, i. 131;\r\n    his inability to sympathize with Washington, 204;\r\n    an enemy of Constitution, ii. 71;\r\n    a genuine American, 309.\r\n\r\n  Alcudia, Duke de,\r\n    interviews with Pinckney, ii. 166.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Philip,\r\n    hunts with Washington, i. 115.\r\n\r\n  Alien and Sedition Laws,\r\n    approved by Washington and Federalists, ii. 290, 297.\r\n\r\n  Ames, Fisher,\r\n    speech on behalf of administration in Jay treaty affair, ii. 210.\r\n\r\n  André, Major,\r\n    meets Arnold, i. 282;\r\n    announces capture to Arnold, 284;\r\n    confesses, 284;\r\n    condemned and executed, 287;\r\n    justice of the sentence, 287, 288;\r\n    Washington's opinion of, 288, ii. 357.\r\n\r\n  Armstrong, John, Major,\r\n    writes Newburg address, i. 335.\r\n\r\n  Army of the Revolution,\r\n    at Boston, adopted by Congress, i. 134;\r\n    its organization and character, 136-143;\r\n    sectional jealousies in, at New York, 162;\r\n    goes to pieces after defeat, 167, 175, 176;\r\n    condition in winter of 1777, 186;\r\n    difficulties between officers, 189;\r\n    with foreign officers, 190-192;\r\n    improvement as shown by condition after Brandywine and Germantown,\r\n  200, 201;\r\n    hard winter at Valley Forge, 228;\r\n    maintained alive only by Washington, 227, 228, 232;\r\n    improved morale at Monmouth, 239;\r\n    mutinies for lack of pay, 258;\r\n    suffers during 1779, 270;\r\n    bad condition in 1780, 279;\r\n    again mutinies for pay, 291, 292, 295;\r\n    conduct of troops, 292, 293;\r\n    jealousy of people towards, 332;\r\n    badly treated by States and by Congress, 333;\r\n    grows mutinous, 334;\r\n    adopts Newburg addresses, 335, 336;\r\n    ready for a military dictatorship, 338, 340;\r\n    farewell of Washington to, 345.\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Benedict,\r\n    sent by Washington to attack Quebec, i. 144;\r\n    sent against Burgoyne, 210;\r\n    plans treason, 281;\r\n    shows loyalist letter to Washington, 282;\r\n    meets André, 282;\r\n    receives news of André's capture, 284;\r\n    escapes, 284, 285;\r\n    previous benefits from Washington, 286;\r\n    Washington's opinion of, 288;\r\n    ravages Virginia, 303;\r\n    sent back to New York, 303;\r\n    one of the few men who deceived Washington, ii. 336.\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Mrs.,\r\n    entertains Washington at time of her husband's treachery, i. 284, 285.\r\n\r\n  Articles of Confederation,\r\n    their inadequacy early seen by Washington, i. 297, 298;
