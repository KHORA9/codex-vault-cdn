YORK.\r\n\r\n_To My Readers_:\r\n\r\nThe following pages are intended to throw some light on imperfectly\r\nknown events connected with Wall Street speculations and investments,\r\nand also upon the condition and progress of the country from a financial\r\nstandpoint, during the fifty years which I have experienced in the great\r\nmoney center.\r\n\r\nThe theme is worthy of an abler pen, but in the absence of other\r\ncontributors to this branch of our National history, I venture the plain\r\nnarrative of an active participator in the financial events of the time\r\nin which I have lived.\r\n\r\nI have also made a brief retrospect of the history of Wall Street, and\r\nfinancial affairs connected therewith since the origin of the Stock\r\nExchange in New York City.\r\n\r\nIn sketching the men and events of Wall Street, I have freely employed\r\nthe vernacular of the speculative fraternity as being best adapted to a\r\ntrue picture of their characteristics, although probably not most\r\nconsonant with literary propriety.\r\n\r\nI have simply attempted to unfold a plain, unvarnished tale, drawing my\r\nmaterial from experience and the records of reliable narrators.\r\n\r\n                                                            HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n=NEW YORK, March 31,

I have never kept a diary regularly, but\r\nhave been occasionally in the habit of preserving certain memoranda in\r\nthe form of letters, and a few scraps from the newspapers at various\r\ntimes. With these imperfect mementoes, I have revived my recollection to\r\ndictate to my stenographer the matter which these pages contain, in a\r\nsomewhat crude form and unfinished style. In fact, I have not aimed at\r\neither finish or effect, not having time for it, but have simply made a\r\ncollection of important facts in my own experience that may help the\r\nfuture historian of Wall Street to preserve for the use, knowledge and\r\nedification of posterity some of the most conspicuous features and\r\nevents in the history of the place that is yet destined to be the great\r\nfinancial centre of the world.\r\n\r\nIf I can only succeed, out of all the poorly-arranged material I have\r\ngathered, in furnishing the historian of the future with a few facts for\r\na portion of one of his chapters, I shall have some claim upon the\r\ngratitude of posterity.\r\n\r\nIn my description of Drew, Vanderbilt, Gould, Travers, Keene, Conkling\r\nand others, I have followed the advice which Oliver Cromwell gave his\r\nportrait painter: “Paint me as I am,” he said. “If you leave out a scar\r\nor a wrinkle, I shall not pay you a farthing.” I have given my opinion\r\nof men and things also without any superstitious regard for the proverb\r\n_de mortuis nil nisi bonum_.\r\n\r\nI have also endeavored to refrain from setting down aught in malice.\r\nMany of those referred to are now dead.\r\n\r\nWhen any of those gentlemen of whom I have had occasion to speak, who\r\nstill survive, shall write a book, they can indulge in the same\r\nprivilege with my name that I have done with theirs, whether I am living\r\nor dead at the time.\r\n\r\nI shall ask no indulgence for myself that I don’t accord to others.\r\n\r\nI have expressed my opinions freely from a Wall Street point of view,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the much-abused operator and broker, and “bloated\r\nbondholder.”\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to enlighten the public on the true status of Wall\r\nStreet, as the very backbone of the country’s progress and prosperity,\r\ninstead of misrepresenting it as a den of gamblers, according to the\r\nignorant and somewhat popular prejudice of the majority who have\r\nattempted to write or speak on the subject. This feeling has been\r\nlargely fostered by clergymen, on hearsay evidence, as well as by the\r\npractices of professional swindlers, who have been smuggled into Wall\r\nStreet from time to time, but who have no legitimate connection\r\ntherewith any more than they have with the church, which repudiates them\r\nas soon as it discovers them.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the great aim of the book is to place Wall Street in its true\r\nlight before the eyes of the world, and help to efface the many wrong\r\nimpressions the community have received regarding the method of doing\r\nbusiness in the great financial mart to which the settlement of accounts\r\nin all our industry, trade and commerce naturally converges.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to correct the utterly erroneous impression that\r\nprevails outside Wall Street, in regard to the nature of speculation,\r\nshowing that it is virtually a great productive force in our political\r\nand social economy, and that without it railroad enterprise and other\r\nbranches of industrial development which have so largely increased the\r\nwealth of the nation, would have made but slow progress.\r\n\r\nTo preserve and inculcate these ideas by putting them in what I hope may\r\nbe a permanent form, is another object of publishing this volume. I know\r\nyou can sympathize with me in this effort to set public opinion right,\r\nas many of you have long been making strenuous endeavors after success\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\nTo put the whole matter, then, into one short and comprehensive clause,\r\nmy cardinal object in this book is to give the general public a clearer\r\ninsight of the reputed mystery and true inwardness of Wall Street\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn my relation of certain reminiscences of Wall Street, and in\r\ndiscussing the checkered career of certain brokers, operators and\r\npoliticians, I have endeavored to be guided by a historic aphorism of\r\nLord Macaulay:\r\n\r\n“No past event has any intrinsic importance,” says the great essayist,\r\nlitterateur, historian and statesman. “The knowledge of it is valuable,”\r\nhe adds, “only as it leads us to form just calculations with respect to\r\nthe future.”\r\n\r\nIn the samples of my experience which I have given in this book I have\r\naimed, to some extent, at this rendition of the noble purposes of\r\nhistory and biography in their philosophic and scientific application of\r\nteaching by example. If I have fallen far short of this high ideal of\r\nthe British Essayist, as I humbly feel that I have, I must throw myself\r\non the kind indulgence of the readers, and ask them to take the will for\r\nthe deed. For the presentation of the facts themselves I crave no\r\nindulgence. They are gems worthy of preservation in the light of the\r\nabove definition. I only submit that the setting might be much better.\r\n\r\nMy chapters on politics may be considered foreign to the main issue, but\r\nas many of the events therein described were intimately connected with\r\nmy business career, I think they are not much of a digression.\r\n\r\n                                                            HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n   MY PART IN MARKETING THE UNITED STATES CIVIL WAR\r\n                             LOANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BY HENRY CLEWS, LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a very large majority of Americans now living the great Civil\r\nWar—waged from 1861 to 1865—between the North and the South is only\r\nknown as a matter of history. But it was the greatest war the world ever\r\nwitnessed, involving the loss of nearly a million of men, and I have a\r\nvivid recollection of it, for I was an actor in it, from its beginning\r\nto its end, to the extent of providing some of the sinews of war for the\r\nUnited States Government, without which it could not have defeated the\r\narmies of secession, and preserved the Union.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Abraham Lincoln was elected to the Presidency of the\r\nUnited States, in November, 1860, the South began to prepare for\r\nsecession from the North, peaceably if the North consented, but by war\r\nif it resisted. It was bent on this course because it foresaw in a\r\nRepublican administration at Washington its practical loss of control of\r\nCongress and the spoils of office—in fact, of the Government itself—that\r\nit had so long enjoyed under Democratic administrations. James\r\nBuchanan’s term as President having expired on March 4, 1861, Abraham\r\nLincoln was then inaugurated as his successor. It angered the South to\r\nsee a Republican succeed a Democrat in the White House, and it\r\nprecipitated the tremendous conflict that followed, by seizing Fort\r\nMoultrie, in Charleston Harbor, and firing on Fort Sumter. Fort\r\nMoultrie’s guns awoke the North to action, and made it a determined unit\r\nin defense of the flag that had been fired upon, and its cry was, “The\r\nUnion must and shall be preserved!”\r\n\r\nAs this was the most eventful and critical period in our national\r\nhistory since 1776, and so many know it only by what they have read of\r\nit, I will give a general idea of its salient features bearing upon the\r\nGovernment finances and the war loans.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the bombardment of Fort Sumter by Fort Moultrie, on April\r\n14, 1861, Major Robert Anderson, the Union commander, accepted, under\r\nthe stern necessities of the situation, General Beauregard’s terms of\r\nevacuation, the die was cast.\r\n\r\nThe North picked up the gauntlet of war with patriotic enthusiasm, and\r\nthe great conflict had begun. But when our troops marched out of that\r\ndismantled stronghold of the Union, with drums beating and colors\r\nflying, it is safe to say that few or none, either in the North or the\r\nSouth, foresaw the long and mighty struggle that would, for four\r\neventful years, follow the bombardment of Fort Sumter, during which gold\r\nwould become demonetized before the end of the year. It did so on\r\nDecember 30, 1861, and in the darkest days of the conflict commanded a\r\npremium as high as one hundred and eighty-five per cent. over United\r\nStates legal tender notes, making these worth only 54 1/20 cents in\r\ngold, while United States bonds were selling for about 60 cents on the\r\ndollar in gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the New York Clearing House agreed, on the date named, to suspend\r\nspecie payments, the example was at once followed by all the banks in\r\nthe country, and gold immediately began to command a small premium. None\r\nsupposed then that the suspension would continue for eighteen years.\r\n\r\nIn England, during the long suspension from 1797 to 1821—through the\r\nNapoleonic wars—the premium on gold never rose above forty-one per\r\ncent., and that was in 1814, the year before the end of hostilities.\r\nThis was owing to the policy of William Pitt and his successors in the\r\nmanagement of the British finances. They raised all the money needed for\r\nwar purposes by taxation and loans, thus restricting the paper money\r\nissues, so as to prevent currency inflation, whereas we pursued the\r\nopposite course.\r\n\r\nWhen Fort Sumter was fired upon, my firm—Livermore, Clews & Co.—was\r\nalready prominent in Wall Street, and I immediately began to devise ways\r\nand means to help the Government to raise the money that I saw would be\r\nnecessary to prosecute the war for the Union which this bombardment made\r\ninevitable. Fort Moultrie’s guns had united the North in a call to arms,\r\nand men by tens of thousands left the farm, the loom, the office, and\r\nthe store, from Maine to Indiana, to join the Union army.\r\n\r\nMoney, therefore, was needed by the United States Government, and very\r\nlarge amounts of it, to equip troops and purchase munitions of war.\r\n\r\nAs James Buchanan was then President, and, like a long line of his\r\npredecessors, a Democrat, he had several Southerners in his Cabinet.\r\nThese promptly resigned their places and went South, including the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, who left with surprising\r\nsuddenness, and the office was filled for a brief period by General John\r\nA. Dix, as acting Secretary.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving, Howell Cobb had offered and sold to Wall Street\r\nbankers $20,000,000 of United States five per cent. bonds at 105,\r\nauthorized, of course, by an old law. Owing, however, to the heavy\r\ndecline in securities, and general depression following the outbreak of\r\nthe war, only about one-quarter of these bonds were taken and paid for\r\nby those who had subscribed for them; and nothing was done by the\r\nGovernment to enforce the completion of the purchase by those who had\r\ndefaulted under the severe stress of the times.\r\n\r\nTheir default was a serious matter for the Government at that time, as\r\nit left the funds in the Treasury in a very depleted condition, and\r\ninterest payments on the public debt were about to fall due, which it\r\nhad no money in its vaults to provide for. At this crisis John J. Cisco,\r\nthe United States Sub-treasurer in New York, was instructed, from\r\nWashington, to call a meeting of the principal Wall Street bankers at\r\nthe Sub-treasury, and after stating the situation to them, to ask for an\r\nemergency loan on one-year United States notes, and let them fix the\r\nrate of interest themselves to correspond with the state of the money\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nMoney was then loaning at about twelve per cent. per annum in Wall\r\nStreet. So when the bankers who responded to Mr. Cisco’s call, myself\r\namong the number, assembled at the Sub-treasury, they, after full\r\ndiscussion, agreed to take the amount of notes offered, and at this rate\r\nof interest. It was a very high rate for the Government to pay, too high\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, but the emergency justified it; and Mr.\r\nCisco approved of it, in view of the market rate and the notes running\r\nfor one year only. My firm took a considerable amount of them and\r\ninduced others to do so also, and we did so, presumably like the rest of\r\nthe buyers, not merely because the rate agreed upon was so high, but\r\nbecause we felt it a duty to help the Government; and at all times\r\nthereafter during that critical period we worked no less diligently to\r\nuphold the public credit.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognized that a default in its interest payments would\r\nhave been disastrous to the public credit, and a stumbling block in the\r\nway of raising money to prosecute the war, besides causing general\r\ndepression of business. It therefore had to be prevented at all hazards.\r\n\r\nHad these notes not been taken, the Treasury would undoubtedly have been\r\nleft without the means of paying this interest when due. Consequently,\r\nit gratified me to feel that I had been instrumental in inducing others\r\nto subscribe for a part of this urgently needed loan.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Mr. Salmon P. Chase was appointed Secretary of the\r\nTreasury by President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards Secretary Chase came to the Sub-treasury and invited\r\nbids for $20,000,000 of six per cent. United States bonds maturing in\r\n1884. These were authorized by an old law. He accepted all bids at 94\r\nand over, but rejected all under 94, the result of which was that\r\nconsiderably more than a third of the 1884’s remained unsold. This was\r\nto be regretted, because the Treasury was in great need of money. I\r\ntherefore quickly bestirred myself to form a combination to purchase the\r\nunsold bonds of 1884 at 94, my firm being willing to take a liberal\r\nshare of them, and I succeeded in getting subscriptions from banks and\r\ncapitalists who had not bought any of those sold, for the unsold amount,\r\nsubject to my own discretion as to the advisability of taking the bonds,\r\nafter going to Washington and conferring with Secretary Chase.\r\n\r\nSo I immediately went there by night train and saw the Secretary early\r\nin the morning at the Treasury, and told him I had come on behalf of the\r\ncombination I had formed, to make him a direct offer at his own\r\nprice—94—for the unsold 1884 bonds. He was evidently pleased and\r\nsurprised by the apparent improvement in the demand for them. He said,\r\nhowever, with a fine sense of probity, and consideration for the rights\r\nof others, that while he was glad I had come to Washington, and made the\r\nproposition to take the balance, he did not think it would be fair to\r\nthose who had bid and whose bids were thrown out, to sell the rest of\r\nthe issue without first notifying them of the new offer, and giving them\r\nthe option of taking what they wanted at the price I offered—94.\r\n\r\nHe asked me to call again the next morning, after he had given the\r\nmatter further consideration, and I did so. But meanwhile I had talked\r\nwith many Southern politicians and office-holders, Peter G. Washington,\r\none of the Virginia Washingtons, among them, and seen so much of the\r\nextensive war preparations which were being made in and about\r\nWashington, that I came to the conclusion that a long and very bitter\r\nwar lay before us, notwithstanding that Mr. Chase had the day previously\r\nassured me that it would all blow over, with peace restored, within\r\nsixty days, a prediction that was echoed by Secretary of State Seward a\r\nlittle later. I was particularly impressed by what Mr. Washington,\r\nhimself a prominent Government official, had told me of Southern\r\nsentiment and Southern determination to fight till all was lost or\r\ngained, and by his and other Southerners’ absolute but mistaken\r\nconfidence that the South would establish its own Confederacy, however\r\nlong a war it might take to do it. The South in seceding from the Union\r\nexpected to be able to establish a slave oligarchy, for in Lincoln’s\r\nelection it foresaw the doom of slavery, as both he and the Republican\r\nparty were pledged to work for its abolition. Yancey and the other\r\nleading Southern “fire eaters” were responsible for this false view.\r\n\r\nWhen I made my second call upon Mr. Chase, I said: “Since I saw you\r\nyesterday, Mr. Secretary, I have heard so much in conversation with\r\nSouthern politicians and office-holders at the hotels, and seen and\r\nheard so much of the extensive war preparations on both sides, that I am\r\nconvinced the war will be a long one, and I fear we shall see much lower\r\nprices for Government bonds and securities of all kinds. Feeling as I\r\ndo, therefore, in justice to those I represent and who have given me\r\nfull power to use my own discretion in the matter, I must withdraw the\r\noffer I made you yesterday. Had you accepted my offer at the time, of\r\ncourse I would have considered the transaction closed, and taken the\r\nbonds without question, but as it is, you will admit I am under no\r\nobligation, and free to retire.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly,” said Mr. Chase, “but I think you are making a mistake,\r\nfor the war will be over in sixty days and these bonds will go to par!”\r\n\r\nBut my sober second thought and foresight, based upon what I had seen\r\nand heard, and the information I had gleaned in Washington, served me\r\nwell, and my associates in the combination had reason to thank me for my\r\nsagacious action, as the bonds soon afterwards declined to 84; and the\r\nUnion disaster at the battle of Bull Run, fought at Manassas on July 21,\r\n1861, aroused the North to a realization of the gravity and vastness of\r\nthe conflict far more than any of the warfare that had preceded it had\r\ndone; at the same time it made it more determined than before to\r\nprosecute the war till the South was conquered into submission to the\r\nUnion forces.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase’s second act, in replenishing the Treasury’s funds, was to\r\noffer for subscription six per cent. United States notes, receivable for\r\nall payments, including customs duties, authority to issue which already\r\nexisted. He found difficulties in the way, however, and, after\r\nconferring with the Sub-treasurer, Mr. John J. Cisco, who recommended\r\nthe appointment of three Wall Street banking houses to act as Government\r\nagents for their sale, on commission, namely, Morris Ketchum & Co.,\r\nRead, Drexel & Van Vleck, and Livermore, Clews & Co., he appointed them.\r\nThese were the first and sole Government agents for the sale of its\r\nsecurities that had been thus far selected, and they all appreciated the\r\ncompliment, and did their work well, for they promptly sold all the\r\nnotes, of this issue, the Secretary had offered.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase throughout made strenuous efforts to supply the Government\r\nwith the means for carrying on the war, and he was loyally aided by the\r\nbanking interests of New York, a fact which he recognized and\r\nacknowledged to me and others in appreciative terms.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent memorable occasion, in the summer of 1861, Secretary\r\nChase appeared at the Sub-treasury after Sub-treasurer John J. Cisco had\r\ncalled, at his request, a number of leading bankers and capitalists to\r\nmeet and confer with him. When we assembled there he said to us, in his\r\nstately and impressive manner, “Gentlemen, the Government needs and must\r\nhave fifty millions of dollars, and it wants it at once to meet war\r\nexpenses. For this I am prepared to issue that amount of Treasury notes\r\nof the two hundred and fifty million issue just authorized by\r\nCongress—by the act of July 17, 1861—bearing interest at 7 3/10 per\r\ncent. I am no financier, so I cannot tell you how to raise the money,\r\nbut you distinguished leaders in the world of finance well know what\r\nmeans to adopt to get it. So I leave it in your hands entirely. All I\r\nneed say further is to repeat that the Government must have fifty\r\nmillions of dollars, and I leave it to you to find the way to procure\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Chase sat down, and all of us who were present compared notes\r\nwith each other in conversation about the room; that is, we talked the\r\nmatter over for nearly twenty minutes. The result of the conference was\r\nthen announced by our spokesman, Moses Taylor, who said, addressing Mr.\r\nChase:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Secretary, we have decided to subscribe for the fifty millions of\r\nUnited States Government securities that you offer, and to place that\r\namount at your disposal immediately! So you can begin to draw against it\r\nto-morrow!”\r\n\r\nA general clapping of hands followed this prompt announcement, and Mr.\r\nChase responded by saying:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I thank you on behalf of the Government for your public\r\nspirit in helping it so generously and so promptly in this emergency.”\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was of rare and stirring interest, and momentous\r\nconsequences hinged upon its result. As a drama drawn from real life it\r\nwould have been effective if represented on the stage, with the large\r\nand portly form and massive head of Secretary Chase as its leading\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nThis was the first lot, or installment, of the $250,000,000 issue of\r\n7-30 Treasury notes put on the market.\r\n\r\nOf these, the Secretary had the privilege of issuing $50,000,000,\r\npayable in coin at the Sub-treasuries in New York, Boston, and\r\nPhiladelphia, without interest, to be used as currency.\r\n\r\nAfter disposing of the first 50,000,000 of 7-30 notes, as I have\r\ndescribed, Secretary Chase communicated with the banks concerning the\r\nsale of the remainder, with the view chiefly of saving the payment of\r\ncommission to the agents. But he was unable in that way to make sales on\r\nsatisfactory terms to them. So he added to the three Government agents\r\noriginally appointed for the sale of its securities, Fisk & Hatch, and\r\nVermilye & Co., of New York, and Jay Cooke & Co., of Philadelphia, and\r\ntold them the “7-30” notes would be delivered to them as fast as called\r\nfor at the New York Sub-treasury.\r\n\r\nThereupon the New York agents held a meeting, at which it was agreed\r\nthat Jay Cooke, of Philadelphia, should be at the head of the agency\r\nsystem and take charge of the advertising of the 7-30 loan, or, in other\r\nwords, that Jay Cooke should act as Chairman of the agency system. The\r\nagreement also specified the commission rates and other details for the\r\npurpose of avoiding cutting, or clashing, between the agents. To this\r\norganization and agreement Mr. Chase assented; and all the agents made\r\nstrenuous efforts to make sales from the word go.\r\n\r\nJay Cooke & Co. had no office in New York at that time, nor did they\r\nestablish one till after the end of the war. This really led to their\r\ndesignation as the head of the agency system, as the selection of a New\r\nYork firm would have created jealousy among the New York firms.\r\n\r\nAfter all the 7-30s authorized to be issued were sold, came the 5-20\r\nloans, which were sold through the same Government agency system, and\r\nthe 5-20s were as successful as the 7-30s had been.\r\n\r\nMr. Munson B. Field, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Salmon P.\r\nChase, had an examination made of the books at Washington, at my\r\nrequest, to see which individual firm of the Government agents sold the\r\nmost United States 7-30s and 5-20s, and he reported that Livermore,\r\nClews & Co. had the highest record. But I am willing that the credit\r\nshould be shared equally by the four United States war loan banking\r\nfirms, viz.: Jay Cooke & Co.; Livermore, Clews & Co.; Vermilye & Co.,\r\nand Fisk & Hatch, as all did equally good and earnest work in financing\r\nthe Government during the Civil War. Certainly the four firms are\r\nentitled to equal credit, and no one to a greater extent than the\r\nothers. There was sufficient glory achieved by the magnificently\r\npatriotic work done by these four firms to admit of dividing the honors,\r\nso that I do not hesitate to say that they did immensely valuable\r\nservice to the Nation, and made for themselves a proud National record,\r\nwhich should be always greatly appreciated by the American people, as it\r\nwas at the time by the Government authorities in Washington. The\r\nGovernment was thus enabled to clothe and feed a million of soldiers in\r\narms on the battlefield, fighting for the salvation of the Nation, and\r\nthese finally brought the war to a victorious end, thus perpetuating the\r\nbest form of government known to man.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that Secretary Chase said:\r\n\r\n“If it had not been for Jay Cooke and Henry Clews, I should never have\r\nbeen able to sell enough of the 7-30 notes and 5-20 bonds to carry on\r\nthe war.”\r\n\r\nThis remark of his was generally published at the time in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThe Government had sold through its agents $150,000,000 of the 7-30\r\nnotes before the suspension of specie payments, an event that was\r\nhastened by the Secretary’s withdrawal from the banks into the\r\nSub-treasuries of most of the proceeds of the sales, his call for\r\npayment from the agents to the Treasury being in three installments: on\r\nAugust 19th, October 1st, and November 2d. Moreover, the hoarding and\r\nexportation of gold were largely stimulated by the anticipation of\r\nspecie suspension, and, after it occurred, gold suddenly disappeared\r\nfrom circulation.\r\n\r\nThis obviously involved a corresponding contraction of the circulating\r\nmedium, and Mr. Chase, to neutralize it, and supply the place of the\r\ndemonetized coin, issued the $50,000,000 of non-interest-bearing notes,\r\nwhich were called United States Demand Notes. He did this also to\r\nobviate the necessity of the State Banks issuing more of their own\r\nnotes, as well as to raise money to meet the rapidly increasing demands\r\nof the Treasury.\r\n\r\nCongress, seeing that this contraction tended to produce stringency in\r\nthe money market, and handicapped the Government’s agents in the sale of\r\nits securities, had, on August 5, 1861, suspended the act of August 6,\r\n1846, “providing for the better organization of the Treasury, and for\r\nthe collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue.”\r\nIt did this so as to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit any\r\nof the money obtained on authorized loans in such solvent specie-paying\r\nbanks as he might select, and, in addition, it expressed this in a\r\nresolution. The resolution was promptly acted upon by Secretary Chase,\r\nand this, and a later law, governed the policy of the Treasury ever\r\nafterwards. Monetary stringency was thus avoided by the Treasury keeping\r\nas much of its money in the banks as it could, and so locking up as\r\nlittle as possible in the Treasury and Sub-treasuries. The evil effects\r\nof the Sub-treasuries system in locking money out of circulation was\r\nthus practically acknowledged and guarded against.\r\n\r\nWhen the sale of the 7-30s had been completed by the Government agents,\r\nthere was great pressure brought to bear by the banks throughout the\r\ncountry, who were backed by many influential newspapers, in favor of\r\ngiving the sale of the 5-20s to the banks instead of to the Government\r\nagents. The pressure upon Secretary Chase became so great that he\r\nconcluded to try the experiment, and authorized all the banks throughout\r\nthe country to sell the 5-20s. After giving them every opportunity to\r\nsupersede the agency system, as previously adopted with the six per\r\ncent. and the 7-30 Treasury notes, the Secretary was finally compelled\r\nto abandon the banks and go back again to the agents, who took hold with\r\nvigor and made the sale of the 5-20s as brilliant a success as they had\r\npreviously made that of the 7-30s. We were friendless in Europe, but we\r\novercame this by patriotism and energy at home.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, some of the banks, and there were only State Banks then,\r\nthrew out the Demand Notes, and so it became necessary to enforce their\r\ncirculation. To accomplish this, Secretary Chase asked Congress to make\r\nthem a legal tender for the payment of all debts, public and private,\r\nexcepting customs duties, and interest on the public debt, payable in\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nCongress, therefore, on February 25, 1862, remedied the difficulty by\r\npassing the Legal Tender Act, making these and all the United States\r\nnotes lawful money. In the same act it authorized the issue of\r\n$150,000,000 of new non-interestbearing legal tender notes. The\r\nprovision for the payment in coin of customs duties and interest on the\r\nbonded debt was obviously as necessary as it was wise, as customs duties\r\nfurnished the means for paying the interest in specie; and the fact of\r\nits being payable in gold created a demand for our bonds in other\r\ncountries, as well as at home, which would not have existed on paper\r\nmoney interest.\r\n\r\nBefore long, the whole of the authorized $250,000,000 of 7-30 notes had\r\nbeen sold to the public through the Government agents; and later, from\r\ntime to time, Congress authorized large additional amounts of these till\r\nfinally they reached their maximum, in August, 1865, when $830,000,000\r\nof them were outstanding.\r\n\r\nAt the same date, also, the Government bond issues, which had kept pace\r\nwith the 7-30 note issues, and simultaneously reached their maximum,\r\nshowed immense totals. There were then outstanding $514,880,500, of 5-20\r\nbonds, and $172,770,100 of 10-40 bonds. Among our own people patriotism\r\nand profit combined to make these great United States loans doubly\r\nattractive, and the Government agents used their best efforts to\r\nstimulate the demand for them both at home and abroad. Livermore, Clews\r\n& Co., in particular, sold large amounts of these in England and other\r\nforeign countries, where they ultimately proved extremely profitable\r\ninvestments. To meet the demands of the war, we—the Government\r\nagents—were as anxious as the Secretary of the Treasury himself, and\r\nnever were men more successful in accomplishing their object and doing\r\ngood work than we were. There was patriotism worthy of Patrick Henry, as\r\nwell as profit, in this, and Wall Street can lay the flattering unction\r\nto its soul that it rendered, through the Government agents, the best of\r\ngood service to the Government in this time of peril to the Union.\r\n\r\nAs General Grant said long afterwards to me, we were not fighting for\r\nthe Union as soldiers in the field, but we served it equally well by\r\nhelping it in its struggle for money to prosecute the war; and I felt\r\nproud of the active part I took in thus helping to preserve the Union as\r\none of its army in civil life.\r\n\r\nThe campaign in Virginia having proved prolific of disaster to the Union\r\narmy, Congress, on July 11, 1862, authorized the issue of a hundred and\r\nfifty millions more of non-interest-bearing United States legal tender\r\nnotes, and on January 17, 1863, another hundred millions to which it\r\nadded $50,000,000 on March 3d, in the same year, making $450,000,000 of\r\nlegal tender notes, or greenbacks, fifty of which were to be held as a\r\nTreasury reserve, for the redemption of temporary loan certificates.\r\n\r\nThis was the maximum issue of non-interest-bearing legal tender notes at\r\nany time, and by the act of January 28, 1865 Congress restricted the\r\ntotal to $400,000,000, and there it remained till Hugh McCulloch became\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, early in 1865.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase had meanwhile become Chief Justice of the United States\r\nSupreme Court, and Thomas Fessenden, who succeeded him as Secretary, had\r\nresigned. Mr. McCulloch began to contract the legal tender notes, and\r\nhad withdrawn $44,000,000 before Congress interfered to prohibit any\r\nfurther contraction. It did this in response to a general protest\r\nagainst any further curtailment of the greenbacks in circulation.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the panic of 1873 their amount remained at\r\n$356,000,000. In the interval Mr. Boutwell had succeeded Mr. McCulloch,\r\nand Mr. Richardson had succeeded Mr. Boutwell as Secretary. Mr.\r\nRichardson, under diminished customs and revenue receipts, and the\r\nstress of the panic, restored to circulation $26,000,000 of the\r\n$44,000,000 of legal tender notes that had been withdrawn by Mr.\r\nMcCulloch, whereupon Congress, on June 22, 1874, provided that the\r\ngreenbacks in circulation should remain fixed at the then existing total\r\nof $382,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe same law which thus legalized the reissue of the $26,000,000 of\r\nlegal tender notes by Secretary Boutwell abolished the National Bank\r\nreserve, previously required to be kept on bank-note circulation, and\r\nfor this substituted the provision that the banks were to deposit five\r\nper cent. in legal tender notes of the amount of their own note issues\r\nwith the United States Treasurer at Washington for the redemption of\r\ntheir notes.\r\n\r\nThis law is still in force, and the establishment of the Redemption\r\nBureau at Washington has resulted, ever since, in daily receipts by it\r\nof mutilated bank notes to be replaced by new notes, in addition to the\r\nebb and flow caused by banks increasing or reducing their circulation.\r\nThe five per cent. in legal tender deposited is counted by them as part\r\nof their legal reserve. But the necessity of sending the notes to\r\nWashington, and of receiving them therefrom, involves trouble and loss\r\nof time to the banks, and also prevents the banks from contracting their\r\ncirculation when the demand for it is light and increasing it when\r\nheavy, as freely and promptly as they would if every Sub-treasury was\r\nmade a redemption point for National Banks. Congress ought therefore to\r\nauthorize the equipment of the Sub-treasuries with redemption bureaus\r\nfor the banks in their respective districts, in order to facilitate this\r\nebb and flow of bank-note issues, and so increase the much needed\r\nelasticity of the currency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to United States legal tender notes, large amounts of\r\ninterest-bearing legal tender notes were issued during the war. On\r\nSeptember 1, 1865, when the currency, like the whole National debt,\r\nreached its greatest amount of inflation, the noninterest-bearing legal\r\ntender notes and fractional currency stood at $459,505,311, the three\r\nyears six per cent. compound interest legal tender notes at more than\r\n$217,000,000, and the one and two years five per cent. legal tender\r\nnotes at nearly $34,000,000, the whole aggregating $685,236,269 issued\r\nby the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThere were also outstanding $107,000,000 of temporary loan certificates.\r\nThese, being payable after ten days’ notice, were treated as greenbacks\r\nby the banks, and counted as part of their lawful money reserve, while\r\nthe remainder circulated as currency, and so practically increased the\r\nvolume of paper money. At the same time the new National Bank law had\r\nput in circulation $170,000,000 of National Bank notes; and more than\r\n$70,000,000 of State Bank notes were still circulating. The last named\r\nwere, however, soon taxed out of existence by Congress. The grand total\r\nof the issues enumerated was ten hundred and sixty-seven millions of\r\npaper money in circulation. Nor was this all, for there were then\r\noutstanding $85,000,000 of one-year certificates of indebtedness; and\r\nthe $830,000,000 of 7-30 notes, called 7-30s, outstanding were\r\nextensively used as money, and so tended to increase the inflation of\r\nthe currency and prices.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that the inflation of the currency was really\r\nmuch larger than it appeared to be by the Public Debt statements at that\r\ntime. But so rapid was the contraction during the eight years following,\r\nthrough the maturity and cancellation of interest-bearing notes and\r\ncertificates, that it is safe to say we had from sixty to seventy-five\r\nper cent. less paper, used as money, in circulation when the panic of\r\n1873 commenced than we had in September, 1865, and to this enormous\r\ncontraction of our medium of exchange that disastrous panic, the worst\r\nthis country ever had, was largely due. It was, I repeat, the worst in\r\nits effects that this country ever experienced, not excepting the panics\r\nof 1837 and 1857, and was aggravated by the Franco-German War, that\r\npractically shut American securities out of the European markets, which\r\nhad previously taken them freely. This was a severe blow to the American\r\nbankers who had undertaken to finance the railways then in process of\r\nconstruction in different parts of the country, and who had relied upon\r\nfinding both home and foreign markets for the sale of the bonds issued\r\nagainst the completed mileage of these railways, and it led to much\r\nembarrassment and a number of failures. The depression following this\r\npanic of 1873—in which Jay Cooke & Co. failed owing to their having\r\nundertaken to finance the Northern Pacific—was prolonged, and prosperity\r\ndid not really return to us as a Nation till after the resumption of\r\nspecie payments in 1879. Meanwhile, nearly all the uncompleted railways\r\nin the country had been reorganized through foreclosures that wiped out\r\nhundreds of millions.\r\n\r\nOur National debt, which had increased from $64,000,000 on June 30,\r\n1860, and $88,409,387 on June 30, 1861, to $2,845,907,626 on September\r\n1, 1865, had then been very largely reduced, for it was only\r\n$2,140,695,365 on September 1, 1873. The debt and the currency had gone\r\nup and down together under the influence of a common cause. Not till\r\nspecie payments were resumed by the Government and the banks did gold\r\ncease to command a premium. With this the Gold Room became a thing of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThe great activity and the enormous sales of the Government agents may\r\nbe inferred from the maximum amounts I have quoted, of the 7-30 notes,\r\nand the 5-20 and 10-40 bonds outstanding five months after Lee\r\nsurrendered to Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe total debt on which interest was payable in coin then amounted to\r\n$1,116,658,100, while that bearing interest in lawful money was\r\n$1,874,478,100, the first calling for $65,001,570 in gold annually, and\r\nthe other for $72,527,646 of greenback currency.\r\n\r\nThat great event—Lee’s surrender to Grant—that ended the war, was the\r\nfitting prelude to General Grant’s election to the Presidency. It made\r\nit certain that no other Republican candidate for the office of\r\nPresident of the United States would have any chance of success at the\r\nnext general election, and, of course, no Democratic candidate could be\r\nelected. Grant became our great National hero, and the country glorified\r\nhim for his splendid war record.\r\n\r\nBut soon after the memorable historical scene at Appomattox, while the\r\ncountry was rejoicing over the advent of peace, with the Union restored,\r\nthere came that terrible tragedy at Ford’s Theater in Washington, when\r\nPresident Lincoln, on April 14, 1865, was assassinated by John Wilkes\r\nBooth, and on the following day Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn\r\nin as President.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, the Nation was plunged into mourning, and mourning emblems\r\nfrom ocean to ocean testified to the National grief.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on the stormy career of Andrew Johnson as President,\r\nand the impeachment proceedings against him, that for a long time made\r\nboth branches of Congress seething cauldrons of excitement. But it was a\r\nhappy relief to the country when his term expired and General Grant\r\nsucceeded to the Presidency on March 4, 1869, with Schuyler Colfax as\r\nVice President. The Democratic candidates who had run against General\r\nGrant in the campaign in which he was elected in November, 1868, were\r\nHoratio Seymour and General Francis P. Blair, Jr. But the popularity of\r\nGrant was so overwhelming that his election was a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nTill within a short time of its final termination the duration of the\r\nwar was a matter of much uncertainty, and its ultimate result had long\r\nbeen the subject of doubt and gloomy forebodings by many who failed to\r\nsee that the superior money power and resources of the North were sure\r\nto conquer and crown the Union with victory in the end. Our currency,\r\ngreatly inflated though it was, remained good throughout the trying\r\nordeal, whereas that of the Confederate States became utterly\r\ndiscredited and worthless, thus repeating the history of the French\r\n_assignats_.\r\n\r\nA new era opened in our history with the ending of the war, and our\r\ncurrency, which, of course, had previously no circulation in the South,\r\nbegan to circulate there. This, of itself, was equivalent to extensive\r\ncontraction. The currency of one section had now to supply the currency\r\nneeds of both sections, and for a long time the drain of money from the\r\nNorth to the South was felt in the money market.\r\n\r\nThe country was somewhat like a sick man accustomed to and dependent on\r\nstimulants, to withdraw which suddenly would have been perilous. Many in\r\nCongress recognized this danger, for it was a noticeable feature of the\r\ndebates on the subject that not a few of those who had been strongly\r\nopposed to our excessive issues of paper money during the war, and\r\nwarned the country against them, were among those who opposed violent\r\ncontraction as being a remedy worse than the disease. The radical\r\ncontractionists, however, failed to see, or refused to acknowledge, that\r\nthe arguments which would have applied to the rising tide of the\r\ncurrency while the war continued, and there was danger of indefinite\r\nfurther inflation, did not apply with equal force to the altered\r\ncondition of affairs.\r\n\r\nAlthough schemes of radical contraction were rejected, even the moderate\r\nmeasure of contraction that was adopted proved too severe to be endured\r\nwithout much complaining from business interests, so hard and painful is\r\nthe process of contraction, whereas that of inflation is always pleasant\r\nand easy.\r\n\r\nIn later years I became very well acquainted with General Grant, and\r\ntoward the end of his first term of the Presidency, when a good deal of\r\nopposition was manifested to his renomination by the press, including\r\nthe New York _Evening Post_, I made strenuous efforts to secure his\r\nrenomination. To that end I organized a public meeting at the Cooper\r\nInstitute, and induced William E. Dodge to act as Chairman. It was a\r\ngreat popular success, and Grant’s renomination was unanimously\r\nadvocated with immense enthusiasm. The _Evening Post_ then said that\r\nafter such an overwhelming demonstration it was evident that public\r\nsentiment was on the side of Grant, and that it was useless to oppose\r\nhis renomination. He was accordingly renominated by the Republican Party\r\nand triumphantly reëlected. His second term as President began on March\r\n4, 1873, and he retired from the Presidency four years later.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was well aware of the part I took at this meeting, which,\r\nmany said, turned the scale in favor of his renomination when it was\r\ndoubtful and trembling in the balance, and he also knew of my services\r\nin connection with the Government war loans, and in organizing various\r\npublic meetings to celebrate Union victories and stimulate recruiting\r\nfor the army. He said that I deserved some public recognition of my\r\npublic services in supplying the sinews of war, and asked me how I would\r\nlike to be Secretary of the Treasury, but I said I preferred Wall\r\nStreet. Therefore, later on, he appointed me Fiscal Agent for the United\r\nStates Government in all foreign countries, in place of Baring Brothers,\r\nof London, who had been its fiscal agents up to that time, since the\r\nBank of England had acted in that capacity.\r\n\r\nWhen it became certain that General Grant’s death was very near, I was\r\nanxious to see him once more, and also a strong advocate of his burial\r\nin the city of New York, where his tomb would be a conspicuous monument,\r\nto be seen by all, instead of burying him almost out of sight in\r\nArlington Cemetery or at West Point, which places were strongly urged.\r\nThe States of Ohio and Illinois also claimed him, as did the city of St.\r\nLouis. They all made strenuous efforts to obtain the family’s consent,\r\nas well as his, through committees sent to Mount McGregor for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSo I went to Mount McGregor, where he was, and as delicately as possible\r\nurged this upon him and his family. All of the members of the family\r\nassented, and the General, being unable to speak, nodded his assent also\r\nto what I said. Then when he was wheeled out in his chair, on the\r\nveranda, on his way to take his regular afternoon sun bath on the\r\nmountain side, accompanied by Dr. Douglas, he wrote on a pad that all he\r\ndemanded was that his wife should be buried by his side when her own\r\ntime came. Knowing them all well, I remained there two hours, talking\r\nwith the General and the family, and my visit, when I made its result\r\nknown, led to the selection of New York as the great soldier’s burial\r\nplace, on the conditions mentioned by him. Within three days after I had\r\nseen him, the great General died. I had visited him on a Monday\r\nafternoon, and he died on the following Wednesday. His death threw the\r\nNation into mourning.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I may mention that I started the organization of the\r\nfamous Committee of Seventy, that brought about the overthrow of the\r\ncorrupt Tweed Ring, that had robbed the city of New York of about a\r\nhundred millions of dollars. I nominated sixty-five of its members, and\r\nfor my instrumentality in forming that Committee of eminent and\r\npublic-spirited citizens I received many congratulations. That Committee\r\nnot only drove the thieves out of office, but caused the prosecution of\r\nall of them who had not fled the country, and ultimately brought back\r\nand convicted Tweed, who died in prison. Meanwhile, it had reorganized\r\nthe City Departments, and put new men in office, with Andrew H. Green as\r\nComptroller. It purified, and, for a time, virtually ruled the city,\r\nthrough controlling its government.\r\n\r\nBut above everything else in my business life, I regard with most\r\nsatisfaction the work I did in marketing the Civil War loans of the\r\nGovernment of this great and glorious country of ours—the United States\r\nof America—and in other ways strengthening the hands of the Government\r\nto the best of my ability and with all my heart and soul, not only as a\r\nbanker but a patriotic American citizen; and I felt that I had my reward\r\nwhen, after the memorable four years’ war, peace came bringing with it\r\nVictory for the Union and a reunited country, a victory which gave\r\npermanence to the best government ever known to man—a government “of the\r\npeople, for the people, and by the people,” which bids fair to be\r\neverlasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MILLS BUILDING (OPPOSITE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE), NOS. 11-13-15-17\r\n    BROAD STREET AND 35 WALL STREET, OCCUPIED BY THE BANKING HOUSE OF\r\n    HENRY CLEWS & CO.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FIFTY YEARS IN WALL STREET\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n                         BY HENRY CLEWS, LL.D.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n           MY DEBUT IN WALL STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY advent in Wall Street was on the heels of the panic of 1857. That\r\npanic was known as the “Western blizzard.” It was entitled to the name,\r\nas its destructive power and chilling effects had surpassed all other\r\nfinancial gales that had swept over Wall Street. The first serious\r\nresult of its fatal force was the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust\r\nCompany, a concern of gigantic dimensions in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Company had an office in Wall Street, and on the announcement of the\r\ncollapse, business became completely paralyzed. This failure was\r\nimmediately followed by the suspension of many large firms that had\r\nwithstood the shock of all ordinary collisions and had successfully\r\nweathered many financial storms.\r\n\r\nThe panic was due in part to excessive importations of foreign goods,\r\nand also to the rapid construction of railroads, to a large extent on\r\nborrowed capital. There were other contributing causes. The crops were\r\nbad that year, and the country was unable to pay for its imports in\r\nproduce, and coin was brought to the exporting point. In October, the\r\nNew York City banks suspended payments, and their example was followed\r\nthroughout the country. Bank credits had been unduly expanded\r\neverywhere, and the time had naturally arrived for contraction. It came\r\nwith a bound, and financial disaster spread like a whirlwind, becoming\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe Stock Exchange had been a moderately growing concern for the ten\r\nyears previous to this calamity, and the securities there dealt in had\r\nbeen rapidly accumulating in number and appreciating in value. Its\r\nmembers were wealthy and conservative, with a strong infusion of\r\nKnickerbocker blood, an admixture of the Southern element and a\r\nsprinkling of Englishmen and other foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the crisis on the majority of Stock Exchange properties\r\nwas ruinous. Prices fell fifty per cent. in a few days, and a large\r\nproportion of the Board of Brokers were obliged to go into involuntary\r\nliquidation. There was a great shaking up all around.\r\n\r\nThen came the work of rehabilitation and reorganization. Confidence\r\ngradually returned. The Young Republic had great recuperative powers,\r\nand they were thoroughly exerted in the work of resuming business. Much\r\nof the old conservative element had fallen in the general upheaval, to\r\nrise no more. This element was eliminated, and its place supplied by\r\nbetter material, and with young blood, and in December the banks resumed\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThis panic and its immediate results created an entire revolution in the\r\nmethods of doing business in Wall Street. Prior to this time, the\r\nantique element had ruled in things financial, speculative and\r\ncommercial. This crisis sounded the death knell of old fogyism in the\r\n“street.” A younger race of financiers arose and filled the places of\r\nthe old conservative leaders.\r\n\r\nThe change was a fine exemplification of the survival of the fittest,\r\nand proved that there was a law of natural selection in financial\r\naffairs that superseded old conservatism and sealed its doom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES CLEWS\r\n  Of “The Leasows” Staffordshire, England\r\n  Father of Henry Clews\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY CLEWS\r\n  In 1857, at the Time of His Start in Wall Street\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MRS. ELIZABETH KENDRICK CLEWS\r\n  Mother of Henry Clews\r\n]\r\n\r\nUntil that time, the general idea prevailed that those engaged in\r\nfinancial matters must be people well advanced in years, even to the\r\nverge of infirmity. It is the same idea that has been handed down, as if\r\nby divine right, from old world prejudices, especially in the learned\r\nprofessions. No doctor was considered a safe prescriber unless his hoary\r\nlocks, bald head and wrinkled brow proclaimed that he had almost passed\r\nthe period of exercising human sympathy. The same rule of judgment was\r\napplied to the lawyer and the clergyman.\r\n\r\nThese unworthy prejudices were fostered by the character of the\r\nGovernment of the old country, and nurtured by the surroundings of the\r\nvenerable monarchies of Europe, where they exist largely even to the\r\npresent day. So tenacious of life are these old-fashioned ideas, that\r\nmany of them were found in full vigor, dominating Wall Street affairs up\r\nto the crash of 1857, fostering the antique element and choking off\r\nsalutary enterprise.\r\n\r\nHence the process of decay of these archaic notions and our gradual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis struggle for new life in Wall Street was not successfully developed\r\nwithout a serious effort to attain it. The old potentates of the street\r\nfought hard to prolong their obstructive power, and their tenacious\r\nvitality was hard to smother, reminding one of the nine lives attributed\r\nto the feline species. The efforts of the young and enterprising men to\r\ngain an entrance to the Stock Exchange were regarded by the older\r\nmembers as an impertinent intrusion on the natural rights of the senior\r\nmembers. It was next to impossible for a young man, without powerful and\r\nwealthy patrons, to obtain membership in the New York Stock Exchange at\r\nthe time of which I speak.\r\n\r\nThe old fellows were united together in a mutual admiration league, and\r\nfought the young men tooth and nail, contesting every inch of ground\r\nwhen a young man sought entrance to their sacred circle.\r\n\r\nThe idea then struck me that there was a chance for young men to come to\r\nthe front in Wall Street. I was then engaged in the dry goods importing\r\ntrade, in which I received my early training. I had been kept out of the\r\nExchange for several years by the methods to which I have alluded. My\r\nfate was similar to that of many others. It was only by an enterprising\r\neffort, and by changing the base of my operations, that I finally\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nThe commissions charged at that time were an eighth of one per cent. for\r\nbuying and selling, respectively.\r\n\r\nAfter numerous efforts to gain admission to the Exchange, without\r\nsuccess, I finally made up my mind to force it. I at once inserted an\r\nadvertisement in the newspapers, and proposed to buy and sell stocks at\r\na sixteenth of one per cent. each way. This was such a bombshell in the\r\ncamp of these old fogies that they were almost paralyzed. What rendered\r\nit more distasteful to them still was the fact that, while they lost\r\ncustomers, I steadily gained them. The result was that they felt\r\ncompelled to admit me to their ranks, so that I could be kept amenable\r\nto their rules and do business only in their own conventional fashion.\r\nMy membership cost me, in all, initiation fee and other trifling\r\nexpenses in connection therewith, $500. This presents a striking\r\ncontrast to the recent price of a seat, $35,000, but though this\r\ndifference seems very large, yet the changes in every other respect\r\nconnected with Wall Street affairs have been in similar proportion.\r\nAmong some of the old members of that day were Jacob Little, John Ward,\r\nDavid Clarkson and others whose names may be found in the archives of\r\nthe Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the way in which membership was then appreciated, it\r\nmay be mentioned that speculators frequently offered $100 a week, or ten\r\ntimes the cost of membership, for the privilege of listening at the\r\nkeyhole during the calls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY CLEWS’S BIRTHPLACE, “THE LEASOWS,”\r\n  HILDERSTONE, STAFFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough the prostration growing out of this panic was very great and of\r\nlong continuance throughout the country, general confidence being shaken\r\nto its very foundation, yet, on the whole, it was a great gain, and\r\nmarked an era of financial and speculative progress. It was the chief\r\ncause in drawing out the young element in the business of Wall Street,\r\nwhich might have lain dormant for a much longer period without this\r\nsudden and somewhat rude awakening. It not only brought Young America to\r\nthe front in speculation, commerce and general business, but it imparted\r\nan impetus of genuine enterprise to every department of trade and\r\nindustry, from the good effects of which the country has never since\r\nreceded.\r\n\r\nThis new element, emanating from the throes of one of the greatest\r\nbusiness revolutions that any country has ever experienced, has\r\ncontinued to grow and thrive with marvellous rapidity. It is now getting\r\nso large that the Exchange will soon require a whole block instead of a\r\nbasement as at its origin for its headquarters. The Governing Committee\r\nof the Stock Exchange are now looking forward to arrangements for this\r\nconsummation. How the ancient fathers of my early days in Wall Street\r\nwould have been shocked at the bare idea of such amazing progress!\r\n\r\nIt is not the least singular phase of this evolution in Wall Street,\r\nthat the youthful element to which I have referred stands alone as\r\ncompared with the progress achieved by the same class of men in any\r\nother nation. In America only does the youthful element predominate in\r\nfinancial affairs; and results have justified the selection, which\r\nperhaps in no other nation is possible. Thanks to the freedom of our\r\nRepublican institutions, which, in spite of some individual deductions\r\nand the occasional obstructions of “crankdom,” make way for that\r\nprogress, in the wake of which the other nations of the world are\r\nemulous to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange was at this time situated on William street between Beaver\r\nstreet and Exchange Place. That place is rich in speculative\r\nreminiscences. It was there that Jacob Little made and lost his nine\r\nfortunes. It was there that Anthony Morse, the lightning calculator,\r\noperated. He could foot up four columns of figures as easily as the\r\nordinary accountant could run up one. He had been a clerk, and having\r\nsaved seven hundred dollars by close economy, began to deal in stocks.\r\nHis career at that time was more marvellous even than that of Keene of a\r\nrecent date. Morse made a fortune of several millions in a year, and\r\nbecame bankrupt during the same period, without any available assets to\r\nspeak of. It was all honorably lost, however. There was no Ferdinand\r\nWard game connected with it.\r\n\r\nYouthful speculators had not then learned the “crooked” methods of the\r\nyoung idea of modern times. It was there also that Daniel Drew began to\r\naccumulate those millions that afterward were subject to such a rude\r\nscattering. It was there that the celebrated “corners” in Rock Island,\r\nPrairie du Chien and Harlem were concocted. It was there that the wealth\r\nwas accumulated which built twenty thousand miles of Western railroads,\r\ncausing many millions of acres, that would otherwise have been a\r\nwilderness, to blossom like the rose, in spite of Mr. Powderly’s opinion\r\nthat no material good can come out of speculation, and thus adding\r\nimmense wealth in real estate to the country, besides conferring\r\nincalculable benefits on trade and commerce, and preparing comfortable\r\nhomes not only for the pioneers and surplus population of the Eastern\r\nStates, but a teeming soil that has attracted the down-trodden of every\r\nnation to come and partake of the blessings of freedom and prosperity.\r\n\r\nOne of Jacob Little’s speculative ventures has been rendered\r\nhistorically famous through the rule of limitation of sixty days for\r\noption contracts. The necessity for this limit was brought about by one\r\nof his celebrated attempts to manipulate the market. He was one of the\r\nmost prominent speculators in Erie in the early days of Drew’s\r\ntransactions with that property and its stocks. Mr. Little had been\r\nselling large blocks of Erie on seller’s option, to run from six to\r\ntwelve months. This was in the early history of “corners,” before the\r\nmethod of managing them scientifically had been fully developed and\r\nwhile “blind pools” were yet in embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THIS MAP OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN FROM\r\n    THE ORIGINAL PEN-AND-INK HAND DRAWING MADE BY HENRY CLEWS FIFTY-FIVE\r\n    YEARS AGO.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe leading members of the Erie Board formed a pool to “corner” Mr.\r\nLittle, and ran Erie shares up to a considerable height. They imagined\r\nthat he was in blissful ignorance of their purpose, and had everything\r\narranged for a _coup d’etat_ which was to reach its crisis at two\r\no’clock on a certain day, when Little was to be completely overwhelmed\r\nand hopelessly ruined. An hour prior to the time appointed by the clique\r\nfor his disaster he walked into the Erie office, opened a bag filled\r\nwith convertible bonds, and requested an exchange of stock for the same.\r\nHe had purchased the bonds in London and had them safely locked up for\r\nthe emergency, which he promptly met on its arrival. He got the stock,\r\nsettled his contracts, broke the “corner,” and came out triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe option limit of sixty days was afterwards adopted in order to\r\nprevent similar triumphs in manipulation on the “short” side.\r\n\r\nAs will be illustrated more fully in subsequent chapters, Mr. Little’s\r\nconvertible bond trick was used with signal advantage by his speculative\r\nsuccessors in Erie, who practically demonstrated on several occasions\r\nthat there were millions in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Little was generous and liberal to a fault with his brother\r\nspeculators who had experienced misfortune. He used to say that he could\r\npaper his private office with notes he had forgiven to the members of\r\nthe Board. He was also remarkable for his great memory. He could easily\r\nremember all the operations he made in the course of a day without\r\nmaking a note or a mistake.\r\n\r\nLike Drew, he was careless in his attire, wearing a hat like that of a\r\nfarmer, and not a very prosperous one, but he had no compeer in his day\r\nat calculating ahead in a speculative venture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JACOB LITTLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n          WALL STREET AS A CIVILIZER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLERICAL OBLIQUITY OF JUDGMENT ABOUT WALL STREET AFFAIRS.—THE SLANDEROUS\r\n    ELOQUENCE OF TALMAGE.—WALL STREET A GREAT DISTRIBUTOR, AS EXHIBITED\r\n    IN THE CLEARING HOUSE TRANSACTIONS.—POPULAR DELUSIONS IN REGARD TO\r\n    SPECULATION.—WHAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY SIRES ADVISED ABOUT IMPROVING\r\n    THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS, SHOWING THE STRIKING CONTRAST BETWEEN THEIR\r\n    VIEWS AND THE WAY LORD SALISBURY WANTED TO FIX THINGS FOR THIS\r\n    COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dense ignorance displayed by men outside of Wall Street, in regard\r\nto the business of that great mart, is almost incredible. Even the most\r\nintelligent men I meet in other professions and walks of life have the\r\nmost utterly crude and undefined notions about the methods of doing\r\nbusiness at the Stock Exchange. Many good and pious clergymen are under\r\nthe impression that Wall Street is a name for the sum total of all kinds\r\nof infamy, and solemnly exhort their devoted flocks not to touch the\r\nunclean thing.\r\n\r\nClerical obliquity of judgment is not quite so bad, nor popular\r\nignorance so dense in this respect, as it has been, but there is a large\r\nfield for improvement yet. The business activity of the country, and the\r\nspirit of intercourse being so rapidly infused throughout all ranks of\r\nthe community, have demonstrated that this antipathy to Wall Street has\r\nbeen simply an unworthy prejudice, in spite of the high moral authority\r\nfrom which it has emanated.\r\n\r\nI don’t wish to throw any aspersion on the noble purposes of the clergy.\r\nThe end they have been seeking has been good, but it has not always\r\njustified the means employed. These good men have unwittingly\r\nmisrepresented Wall Street, to the great detriment of the business\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse, however, for a man in this enlightened age, who\r\nprofesses to be a Shepherd in Israel and a spiritual leader of the\r\npeople, to remain ignorant of an important fact, or to continue to see\r\nthat fact through a false medium, when he has the opportunity of coming\r\ninto Wall Street and seeing for himself. He has no right to set himself\r\nup as a censor, a public detractor, and a public libeller upon a set of\r\nmen and merchants who are the bone and sinew of the commercial and\r\nindustrial interests and prosperity of the country. It is not only a\r\npersonal wrong but a public injury.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. T. De Witt Talmage has perhaps done more than any other\r\nclergyman to make our speculators, investors and business men ridiculous\r\nin the eyes of the rest of the community and in the estimation of John\r\nBull, in whose dominion his so-called sermons are extensively read.\r\nTalmage has employed his flashing wit and mountebank eloquence to bring\r\nfinancial disgrace on the business methods of the whole country by the\r\nmanner in which he has ignorantly vilified Wall Street.\r\n\r\nHe can go to the Cremorne Garden, Billy McGlory’s, Harry Hill’s and\r\nother places of dubious reputation, and make himself acquainted with the\r\nreal condition of things there.\r\n\r\nHow far he has penetrated into the green rooms and behind the scenes in\r\nthese places it is not my business to know, but why should he not treat\r\nWall Street as fairly, where everything is open to inspection, as he\r\ndoes these dens of vice, where midnight scenes of villainous revelry and\r\nreckless dissipation reign supreme? Why does he misrepresent Wall Street\r\nwithout knowing anything about it? He can come here and go wherever he\r\nwishes without a bodyguard of detectives or fear of molestation. Why is\r\nhe so particular about doing justice to the brothel and the gaming den,\r\nwhile he airs his ludicrous eloquence to the highest pitch to falsify\r\nthe respectable business methods of Wall Street?\r\n\r\nI recollect the time that men in the higher walks of life, and among the\r\nhigher classes (if I may use the expression, in opposition to the\r\nopinion of the New York _Sun_, whose editor maintains that we have no\r\nclasses in this country) would have been ashamed to be seen in Wall\r\nStreet. Now, men in the same sphere are proud of the distinction, both\r\nsocially and financially. In fact Wall Street has become a necessity as\r\na healthy stimulant to the rest of the business of the country.\r\nEverything looks to this centre as an index of its prosperity. It moves\r\nthe money that controls the affairs of the world.\r\n\r\nTake the Clearing House, for example, with its 50 billions of\r\ntransactions annually. All but a fraction of this wonderful wealth,\r\ncompared with which the stupendous pile of Crœsus was a mere pittance,\r\npasses through Wall Street, continually adding to its mighty power. This\r\ngreat power, in comparison with which the influence of monarchies is\r\nweak, is not, like the riches of these, concentrated chiefly on itself.\r\nIt is imparted to all the industries and productive forces of the\r\ncountry. Wall Street is a great distributor. It is also universal in its\r\nbenevolent effects, practically unlimited by either creed or geography.\r\n\r\nIt has taken greater advantage, for the general good, of scientific\r\ndiscovery than all the scientific societies combined. Wherever the\r\nelectric wires have penetrated the Wall Street broker has followed. The\r\nmembers of the Stock Exchange are, through the power of electricity, in\r\ncloser sympathy with the great heart of civilized humanity than all the\r\nmissionaries and philanthropic societies in the world. They are the\r\ngreat cosmopolitans of the age. In practical sympathy they outshine the\r\nmost devoted efforts of the benevolent associations of half the\r\ncontinent. They have the means to do it, and this comes chiefly from\r\nbeing practical, and from their strong antipathy as a body to cant and\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThere are many popular delusions outside the ranks of the clergy\r\nconnected with the effort to form a correct estimate of Wall Street\r\naffairs by the general public. It is a popular delusion that it is a\r\nplace where people who are in the “ring” take something for nothing. No\r\nidea could be further wide of the mark in regard to Wall Street men as a\r\nclass, however true it may be of some individual instances, as in other\r\ndepartments of business. Wall Street gives full value for everything it\r\nreceives, and the country at large is deeply its debtor. Some people may\r\nthink this a paradox, but there is nothing more easily demonstrated to\r\nthose who have observed the commercial and industrial progress of the\r\ncountry and the age.\r\n\r\nWall Street has furnished the money that has set the wheels of industry\r\nin motion over the vast continent, and in one century has brought us\r\nabreast, in the industrial arts, of countries that had from one to two\r\nthousand years the start of us. In this respect it has assisted nobly to\r\ncarry out the ideas of the fathers of the Constitution. Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, Franklin and Hamilton laid down the doctrine that it\r\nwould be a betrayal of the interests of posterity to limit the\r\nproductive energies of this country to raw material. With our present\r\nexperience we may think it strange that this question should ever have\r\nbeen debated, but it was, even after the old tyranny had been obliged to\r\nloosen its grasp on the struggling enterprise of the young Republic. Our\r\nold revolutionary sires deserve credit for their foresight, but what\r\nwould have been the fate of their commercial philosophy if Wall Street\r\nhad not supplied the sinews of war to cope with the forces of nature, to\r\nwork our mines and build our railroads, and through these and other\r\nmeans, to attract the teeming population from every clime to cultivate\r\nour virgin soil and develop our wonderful industries and resources?\r\n\r\nApropos of the above observations, I may add that during the debate in\r\nthe British Parliament, on the recognition of the Confederacy, the great\r\nmanufacturing power in our industrial, financial and commercial progress\r\nwas clearly exhibited and thoroughly appreciated by British statesmen.\r\nIt was made one of the strongest arguments, too, by some of the\r\nrepresentatives of our jealous and envious cousins on the other side of\r\nthe “pond,” why Great Britain should recognize and aid the South in the\r\nwar. Lord Salisbury, then Lord Robert Cecil, at present the leader of\r\nthe Tory party in England, and the advocate of twenty years’ coercion\r\nfor Ireland, was one of the bitterest foes of the Union, chiefly on this\r\naccount. He was one of the Vice-Presidents of the “Southern Independent\r\nAssociation,” for the promotion of the cause of the Rebellion, and for\r\nsupplying the Confederates with money and arms, and for the ultimate\r\nobject of founding an empire of slavery on this continent.\r\n\r\nIn his speech then, on the Southern blockade, the future Lord Salisbury\r\nmade the following touching allusion to our dangerous prosperity on this\r\nside: “The plain matter of fact is, as every one who watches the current\r\nof history must know, that the Northern States of America never can be\r\nour sure friends, for this simple reason—not merely because the\r\nnewspapers write at each other, or that there are prejudices on both\r\nsides, but because we are rivals—rivals politically, rivals\r\ncommercially. We aspire to the same position. We both aspire to the\r\ngovernment of the seas. We are both manufacturing people, and in every\r\nport as well as at every court we are rivals to each other. With respect\r\nto the Southern States the case is entirely reversed. The population are\r\nan agricultural people. They furnish the raw material of our industry,\r\nand they consume the products which we manufacture from it. With them,\r\ntherefore, every interest must lead us to cultivate friendly relations,\r\nand we have seen that when the war began they at once recurred to\r\nEngland as their natural ally.”\r\n\r\nThus we see how anxious Great Britain was to take the place which the\r\nNorth has reserved for itself, and so proudly maintained in commerce and\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe great coming man, Salisbury, wanted to reduce us all to the position\r\nof hewers of wood, drawers of water and planters and pickers of cotton,\r\nfor the special accommodation of Great Britain, as the mighty centre of\r\nthe world’s manufacturing industries. This would have given a set-back\r\nto our civilization, causing us to make a retrogressive move to the dark\r\nages. Since then we have afforded this noble lord and his nation ample\r\nproof that we are very far advanced in the manufacturing arts ourselves,\r\nand that in many things we are far ahead of England, and they are no\r\ndoubt greatly surprised that the arrangement by which England was to\r\nhave all the profit and America all the hard work, has not been carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful development of the industrial arts, Wall Street money,\r\nenterprise and speculation have played by far the most conspicuous and\r\nprogressive part, thus enabling us, in little more than two decades, to\r\noutstrip the old nations that were so anxious to enslave us, in spite of\r\nthe fact that they had centuries upon centuries the start of us. It must\r\nbe galling to some of these people that we are now the most available\r\ncandidates for the commercial and industrial supremacy of the world, and\r\nwe have attained this position, in a great measure, through the\r\ninstrumentality of Wall Street as a civilizer.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n       HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN WALL STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PERIODICAL PANICS IN ORDER TO MAKE\r\n    MONEY.—WHOLESOME ADVICE TO YOUNG SPECULATORS.—ALLEGED “POINTS” FROM\r\n    BIG SPECULATORS END IN LOSS OR DISASTER.—PROFESSIONAL ADVICE THE\r\n    SUREST AND CHEAPEST, AND HOW AND WHERE TO OBTAIN IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut few gain sufficient experience in Wall Street to command success\r\nuntil they reach that period of life in which they have one foot in the\r\ngrave. When this time comes these old veterans of the Street usually\r\nspend long intervals of repose at their comfortable homes, and in times\r\nof panic, which recur sometimes oftener than once a year, these old\r\nfellows will be seen in Wall Street, hobbling down on their canes to\r\ntheir brokers’ offices.\r\n\r\nThen they always buy good stocks to the extent of their bank balances,\r\nwhich have been permitted to accumulate for just such an emergency. The\r\npanic usually rages until enough of these cash purchases of stock is\r\nmade to afford a big “rake in.” When the panic has spent its force,\r\nthese old fellows, who have been resting judiciously on their oars in\r\nexpectation of the inevitable event, which usually returns with the\r\nregularity of the seasons, quickly realize, deposit their profits with\r\ntheir bankers, or the overplus thereof, after purchasing more real\r\nestate that is on the up grade, for permanent investment, and retire for\r\nanother season to the quietude of their splendid homes and the bosoms of\r\ntheir happy families.\r\n\r\nIf young men had only the patience to watch the speculative signs of the\r\ntimes, as manifested in the periodical egress of these old prophetic\r\nspeculators from their shells of security, they would make more money at\r\nthese intervals than by following up the slippery “tips” of the\r\nprofessional “pointers” of the Stock Exchange all the year round, and\r\nthey would feel no necessity for hanging at the coat tails, around the\r\nhotels, of those specious frauds, who pretend to be deep in the councils\r\nof the big operators and of all the new “pools” in process of formation.\r\nI say to the young speculators, therefore, watch the ominous visits to\r\nthe Street of these old men. They are as certain to be seen on the eve\r\nof a panic as spiders creeping stealthily and noiselessly from their\r\ncobwebs just before rain. If you only wait to see them purchase, then\r\nput up a fair margin for yourselves, keep out of the “bucket shops” as\r\nwell as the “sample rooms,” and only visit Delmonico’s for light lunch\r\nin business hours, you can hardly fail to realize handsome profits on\r\nyour ventures.\r\n\r\nThe habit of following points which are supposed to emanate from the big\r\noperators, nearly always ends in loss and sometimes in disaster to young\r\nspeculators. The latter become slavish in their methods of thought,\r\nhaving their minds entirely subjected to others, who are presumed to do\r\nthe thinking for them, and they consequently fail to cultivate the\r\nself-reliance that is indispensable to the success of any kind of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nTo the question often put, especially by men outside of Wall Street,\r\n“How can I make money in Wall Street?” there is probably no better\r\nanswer than the one given by old Meyer Rothschild to a person who asked\r\nhim a similar question. He said, “I buys ‘sheep’ and sells ‘dear.’”\r\n\r\nThose who follow this method always succeed. There has hardly been a\r\nyear within my recollection, going back nearly thirty years, when there\r\nhave not been two or three squalls in “the Street,” during the year,\r\nwhen it was possible to purchase stocks below their intrinsic value. The\r\nsquall usually passes over in a few days, and then the lucky buyers of\r\nstocks at panic prices come in for their profits ranging from five to\r\nten per cent. on the entire venture.\r\n\r\nThe question of making money, then, becomes a mere matter of\r\ncalculation, depending on the number of the squalls that may occur\r\nduring any particular year.\r\n\r\nIf the venture is made at the right time—at the lucky moment, so to\r\nspeak—and each successive venture is fortunate, as happens often to\r\nthose who use their judgment in the best way, it is possible to realize\r\na net gain of fifty per cent. per annum on the aggregate of the year’s\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\nIn this way it is easy to see how the rich will get richer, and the poor\r\npoorer.\r\n\r\nSometimes men make money in Wall Street by strange turns in their\r\nfortunes that appear like having been governed by a special Providence,\r\nand this sometimes occurs when men appear to be utter wrecks.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest examples of this kind, in my personal experience,\r\noccurred in the summer of 1885.\r\n\r\nA man called at my office utterly broken down in spirit, but with a few\r\nhundred dollars left out of many thousands that he had possessed a few\r\nmonths previously.\r\n\r\n“I read your letter of the third of July,” he said, “and had some mind\r\nto act on the advice which it contained, but was unfortunately dissuaded\r\ntherefrom by reading an article in a city paper by a very able writer,\r\nwho had got the bearish mania, then prevalent, on the brain, and who, I\r\nam informed, is now, like myself, almost ruined.”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know what to do,” he continued. “I have a few hundred dollars\r\nleft, which I will leave with you, and you can use your pleasure with\r\nit. I am going out to the country for the remainder of the summer. I\r\nwill leave my address with you, and, if there is any good result, you\r\ncan let me know of it. I really don’t hope for much, and of course, I\r\nneed hardly tell you that, in the event of being ‘wiped out,’ you need\r\nnot apply to me for more margin. Let this go with the rest,” he added,\r\nin a despairing tone.\r\n\r\nThe man walked sadly out, and I did not see him again for months. I\r\ninvested his pittance on the _carte blanche_ order which he had given\r\nme, to the best of my judgment. The result was favorable, and his\r\naccount began to accumulate. He was duly advised, according to our\r\nbusiness methods, of his good luck, but I did not hear anything from him\r\npersonally for several months.\r\n\r\nOne day, a portly gentleman, with rosy health beaming in his face,\r\nstepped into my private office, and was quite profuse in his thanks to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said; “I have but a hazy recollection of your acquaintance, if\r\nI know you at all.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you recollect,” he said, “the time I went to the country in\r\nsummer, when I told you my case, and how I had been unfortunate in\r\nspeculation?”\r\n\r\n“And are you the man who went to the country in despair to die?” I\r\nasked, in surprise at his changed appearance.\r\n\r\n“I am,” he replied, “and I owe the wonderful change which you now see to\r\nyour timely advice. I staked almost my last dollar on that counsel, and\r\nnow I am comfortably fixed through your management of the small fund\r\nplaced at your disposal.”\r\n\r\nHow, this was an example of a man who did make money simply by taking\r\nthe advice that was freely tendered him.\r\n\r\nThere are others who lose, in spite of all that the most honest judgment\r\ncan do to prevent them.\r\n\r\nSome men, when they have money, are so fearfully perverse that all\r\nattempts to get them to do the right thing only have the opposite\r\neffect, and they prefer to follow every wild rumor.\r\n\r\nOne day, for instance, a man gave me an order to buy a thousand shares\r\nof Erie without limit. The order was executed at 94. I had no sooner\r\nbought it than the stock went down.\r\n\r\nMy customer returned in a short time and ordered the stock to be sold.\r\nIt was then 92½.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour afterwards he returned again and ordered it bought back\r\nagain, without any limit as before. It was bought back at 95.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with other friends for some time he ordered it sold\r\nagain. The market by that time was 90.\r\n\r\nHe then came back the fifth time, and said: “I first saw one man who\r\ntold me to buy, and then another who told me to sell. I understand one\r\nis called a ‘bull’ and the other a ‘bear.’ About these names I don’t\r\nknow much, but I do know now that I am a — jackass.”\r\n\r\nThis affords a good illustration of the way the average speculator is\r\nmanaged and perplexed in Wall Street. There is a means of avoiding such\r\na peck of trouble, however, if he would only take a little wholesome\r\nadvice, wait patiently for a proper opportunity, and not rush headlong\r\nto purchase on the “tips” of the delusive rumor mongers. He would then\r\nbegin to learn how to make money in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nAs I have pointed out in another chapter, speculation is a business that\r\nmust be studied as a specialty, and though it is popularly believed that\r\nany man who has money can speculate, yet the ordinary man, without\r\nspecial training in the business, is liable to make as great a mistake\r\nin this attempt, as the man who thinks he can act as his own lawyer, and\r\nwho is said “to have a fool for a client.”\r\n\r\nThe common delusion, that expert knowledge is not required in\r\nspeculation, has wrecked many fortunes and reputations in Wall Street,\r\nand is still very influential in its pernicious and illusory\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nWhen a man wants correct advice in law he goes to a professional lawyer\r\nin good standing, one who has made a reputation in the courts, and who\r\nhas afforded other evidence to the public that he is thoroughly\r\nreliable. No man of average common sense would trust a case in law to a\r\nbar room “bummer” who would assert that he was well acquainted with\r\nAaron J. Vanderpoel, Roscoe Conkling, and Wm. M. Evarts, and had got all\r\nthe inside “tips” from these legal lights on the law relating to the\r\ncase in question. The fellow would be laughed at, and, in all\r\nprobability, if he persisted in this kind of talk, would be handed over\r\nto the city physician to be examined in relation to his sanity, but in\r\nWall Street affairs men can every day make similar pretensions and pass\r\nfor embodiments of speculative wisdom.\r\n\r\nIf speculators are caught and fleeced by following such counsel, the\r\nprofessional brokers who are members of the Stock Exchange, are no more\r\nto blame than the eminent lawyers to whom I have referred would be for\r\nthe upshot of a case that had been taken into court on the advice which\r\nsome irresponsible person had pretended to receive from these\r\ncelebrities of the New York Bar.\r\n\r\nProfessional advice in Wall Street, as in legal affairs, is worth paying\r\nfor, and costs far less in the end than the cheap “points” that are\r\ndistributed profusely around the Street, thick as autumn leaves in\r\nVallombrosa, and which only allure the innocent speculator to put his\r\nmoney where he is almost certain to lose it.\r\n\r\nMy advice to speculators who wish to make money in Wall Street,\r\ntherefore, is to ignore the counsel of the barroom “tippers” and\r\n“tipplers,” turn their backs on “bucket shops,” and when they want\r\n“points” to purchase, let them go to those who have established a\r\nreputation for giving sound advice in such matters, and who have ample\r\nresources for furnishing correct information on financial topics, as\r\nwell as a personal interest in making all the money they can for their\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in finding out such reliable men and firms in the\r\nvicinity of Wall Street, if speculators will only read the newspapers,\r\nor make inquiry of the first messenger boy they may happen to meet.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n       IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESS TRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONS OF INDEPENDENT GENTLEMEN MAKE VERY BAD CLERKS.—THEY BECOME\r\n    UNPOPULAR WITH THE OTHER BOYS, AND MUST EVENTUALLY GO.—NIGHT DANCING\r\n    AND LATE SUPPERS DON’T CONTRIBUTE TO BUSINESS SUCCESS.—GIVE MERIT\r\n    ITS TRUE REWARD.—KEEPING WORTHLESS PRETENSE IN ITS TRUE\r\n    POSITION.—RUNNING PUBLIC OFFICES ON BUSINESS PRINCIPLES.—A PIECE OF\r\n    GRATUITOUS ADVICE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION.—A COLLEGE COURSE NOT IN\r\n    GENERAL CALCULATED TO MAKE A GOOD BUSINESS MAN.—THE QUESTION OF\r\n    ADAPTABILITY IMPORTANT.—CHILDREN SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN THE\r\n    OCCUPATION FOR WHICH THEY SHOW A PREFERENCE.—THOUGHTS ON THE ARMY\r\n    AND NAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have usually found that the sons of independent gentlemen, who have\r\ngreat expectations, make very poor clerks and don’t develope into Good\r\nWall Street men.\r\n\r\nTheir expectations seem to dwarf the ability that might develope under\r\nthe more favorable auspices of being obliged to paddle their own canoe.\r\nLike the light under a bushel, referred to in the Good Book, their\r\nbrilliant qualities are obscured and circumscribed by the paternal\r\nprotection in prospect. They have not a sufficient incentive to work,\r\nbecause they know that all they require for their natural wants will\r\nfall easily into their laps. The motives, therefore, which usually\r\ndevelope the greatest mental qualities are absent and the qualities\r\nthemselves lie dormant, and frequently decay like poppy seeds in their\r\nseed vessels, without being productive of the fruits which are the\r\nresult of industrial habits and the desire for acquisition. Such young\r\nmen, instead of being a help to an office into which they happen to be\r\nthrust, often through friendship and favoritism, are a great hindrance\r\nand a stumbling block in the path to promotion of other young men.\r\n\r\nAfter many ineffectual attempts to reform and remodel them, they have\r\ngenerally to be discarded, as the drone bees are ejected from the rest\r\nof the industrious hive. And they usually become as unpopular with the\r\nother boys as the drone does with his comrades who make the honey and\r\nwill not suffer the idle fellow to feast on the fruits of their labor.\r\n\r\nYoung men who have nothing but their own resources to depend upon will\r\nbe found far more meritorious than this higher class. There are some\r\neminent exceptions, but it takes a large amount of good sense to\r\ncounteract the conceit instilled by the idea of financial independence\r\nby birth.\r\n\r\nThe latter are more liable to youthful and enervating excesses, as they\r\nhave the means to indulge in nocturnal amusements that are not conducive\r\neither to clear brains or active habits during the day.\r\n\r\nNight dancing and late suppers, with some of their social concomitants,\r\nwhen habitually indulged, don’t contribute to business success. I know\r\nhow this is myself, and therefore speak feelingly; but I don’t lay\r\nmyself open to the charge of egotism when I say that I have never\r\npermitted the habit to get the better of me.\r\n\r\nI am not setting myself up as a censor of other men’s habits, nor\r\nattempting to utter mere moral or religious cant. I am simply discussing\r\nthe question from a scientific and physical standpoint, and I say that\r\nthese habits don’t contribute to business success, but, on the contrary,\r\nform one of the greatest hindrances to it. They make any man, no matter\r\nhow strong he may be, physically unfit for ordinary business. These\r\n“recreations” up town, however attractive and delightful they may be,\r\ndon’t fit a young man for business down town. The line must be drawn\r\nsomewhere. Let us draw it, say, at Fourteenth street.\r\n\r\nThere has been much said and written about Civil Service Reform by\r\nvarious authorities from President Cleveland down to Dorman B. Eaton and\r\nthe Custom House officials. The great rule to follow is to give merit\r\nits true reward This draws out the best efforts of the recipient, where\r\nreal merit is found, and keeps the drones beyond the pale of\r\ncompetition. It develops the qualities that are worthy of being\r\nencouraged, and keeps worthless pretense in its true position. This is\r\nthe role I have adhered to in my office, and it works like a charm. My\r\noffice, though not quite so large as the Custom House or Post Office of\r\nNew York city, I think affords a fair test of what could be done on the\r\nlargest possible scale.\r\n\r\nIf public office is a public trust, and we have the high authority of\r\nPresident Cleveland and of the New York _Tribune_ for saying so, I think\r\nit can be administered on the same business principles that have\r\ncontributed to the success of some of the largest and most successful\r\nfirms in the world; and among these, I think I can say without egotism,\r\nas the matter is capable of demonstration, that the house of which I\r\nhave the honor to be the head, stands second to none in the attributes\r\nto which I have referred.\r\n\r\nThe reader may say, “This is a puff for his own house.” Well, even so.\r\nIf it is, it is true, and will bear the strictest investigation. So I\r\ndon’t see why I should feign any false modesty about the assertion. It\r\nwould be sheer affectation to do so.\r\n\r\nCollegiate education is a great question for debate among literary men,\r\njournalists and business men, as to its utility in forming the character\r\nof youth for business life. As the college curriculum and training stand\r\nat present, the ordinary course is not in general calculated to make a\r\ngood business man. It is erroneously regarded by some people as a kind\r\nof substitute for business training in the earlier years of a young\r\nman’s life. There could be no greater mistake in the beginning of a\r\nbusiness career. It is in many instances not only a hindrance, but\r\nabsolutely fatal to success. To put a young man in an office fresh from\r\ncollege, on a level with one of the same age who has been training in\r\nbusiness methods since he left the common school, is demoralizing to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nI wish to have it distinctly understood that in the foregoing remarks I\r\nhave not made any attempt to cast the slightest reflection on the\r\npersonal attributes and abilities of any young man in any line of life\r\nor status of society, and I make this statement perfectly independent of\r\nthe mere social incident as to whether the young man in question may\r\npart his hair in the middle or assume other dudish airs. That is his\r\nbusiness, and I have no right to trench on the sacred precincts of his\r\nindividuality, nor do I mean to do so. As a rule I stick to my own\r\nbusiness. I simply intend to imply that when a dude happens to come into\r\nmy office, where I think he will find the most æsthetic appointments in\r\nthe way of furniture and the business arrangements, if he should, upon\r\nthus entering into my employment, come to the sudden conclusion that\r\nthis æstheticism of office furnishing implied any plea for idleness or\r\nassumption of airs on his part, he would very soon experience a rude\r\nawakening from his charmed lethargy of conceit, and if he were not\r\nprepared to undertake in a calm and appreciative tone of mind the first\r\nlessons of business industry, I would politely bid him an affectionate\r\nadieu, and on parting tell him very kindly that though his great natural\r\ngifts might be thoroughly adapted to shine in another sphere of life, he\r\nwas both by nature and education totally unfitted to play the most\r\nhumble part in a business career, such as that of which my firm affords\r\na fair and most successful example.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks will apply to any other young man who does not\r\nappreciate his vocation, and try to know himself as old Seneca taught.\r\n\r\nI don’t insidiously single out the dude for an odious comparison. The\r\nremark will apply just as appropriately to the young man who is better\r\nfitted for a blacksmith or a farmer, or perhaps a preacher, than a\r\nbusiness man or a financier.\r\n\r\n“All blacksmiths,” says the Rev. Robert Collyer, “can’t become\r\npreachers, and it would be bad for the world if they did.” There is a\r\ngood deal of philosophy in the remark of this popular preacher, and\r\nquite to the point on the subject which I am now attempting to handle.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is nothing in this world would grieve me more than the\r\nprospect of being obliged to reflect in future years on the fact that I\r\nhad been instrumental in keeping a young man’s “nose to the\r\ngrind-stone,” so to speak, in my office, where he would make a very poor\r\nemployee without the chance of attaining average success, while in a\r\ncareer for which nature and education had fitted him, he might not only\r\nbe happy and successful, but make his mark as a star of the first\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed in this light, the question of adaptability becomes a\r\nserious affair, for young men starting in life, and for their parents,\r\nwho often sacrifice a great deal of their worldly comforts and peace of\r\nmind to launch their fond offspring.\r\n\r\nThe best thing for parents to do, then, as a general rule, is to\r\nencourage their children in that occupation or avocation for which they\r\nshow a decided preference. Whatever young men do voluntarily, as a rule,\r\nthey do well. This is especially illustrated in the lives of youths who\r\nexhibit an inclination for a military pursuit, which offers the least\r\ninducement to human avarice, and attracts the mind through the more\r\nsentimental motives of patriotism and the love of glory. But in our\r\npresent civilization there are national feelings that must be inculcated\r\nand encouraged.\r\n\r\nI entertained at my Newport residence, during the past Summer, the\r\nofficers of the 23d Brooklyn regiment of the National Guard of the State\r\nof New York, because I felt it a matter of duty to do so, as well as a\r\nprivilege to do my part in contributing to the encouragement of the\r\nyoung men who have taken it upon themselves voluntarily to be members of\r\nthat militia company.\r\n\r\nThese young men visit Newport at very great cost to each one, as they\r\nthemselves have to contribute to the expenses attending the trip, and\r\ntheir presence in Newport in going through, regularly each day, their\r\ndrills and parades with as much precision and correctness as though they\r\nall had been graduates of West Point, all well equipped and well attired\r\nin plain but most becoming military apparel, made a most interesting\r\nscene to witness, contributing not a little to the amusement and\r\ngratification of the residents of that famous watering place. They are\r\nbecoming disciplined to be soldiers. They are mostly young men of good\r\nfamilies, of profitable occupation, many in business for themselves and\r\nothers trustworthy clerks in the employ of others, with good salaries;\r\nconsequently they make a great sacrifice to themselves in the time that\r\nthey thus bestow upon such excursions as well as ordinarily in the\r\ndrills which they have to go through, when at home, once or twice each\r\nweek, frequently oftener. What is the incentive in this personal\r\nsacrifice on their part?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, the spirit of patriotism, and that really is what it\r\nmeans, for in the event of a foreign invasion or internal disturbances,\r\ntheir services are pledged to the State and to the Government. They are\r\ntherefore liable to receive at a moment’s notice a call from any quarter\r\nto go to the front with their lives in their hands, leaving their\r\nfamilies, their wives, their children, their old parents, their\r\nbusiness, leaving all and requiring a farewell at their departure, as\r\nthe dangers they may have to encounter are threatening in character and,\r\nnot unlikely, may prevent their ever returning alive.\r\n\r\nTaking this view of the subject, therefore, these young men should be\r\nencouraged by all who have the means and power at their hand, and to the\r\nfull extent of their ability. Whenever they go on missions of State\r\ndefense, it is only just and fair that they should be received as\r\nsoldiers, and accorded the honors which soldiers merit. They are\r\nentitled to it to a greater extent than the regular soldiers of the\r\nUnited States standing army. These men do not make one-half the\r\nsacrifice that the young militia do, nor do they make any better\r\nsoldiers on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThese militia soldiers, when they go to the front, leave behind them\r\nenough, in the way of properly, good homes and families, to make them\r\nmore enthusiastic to fight for victory, than the regular army, so that\r\nthey may return to their own domestic circles with the laurels that\r\nvictory gives.\r\n\r\nIn thin country we do not desire standing armies, for we do not wish the\r\nexpense entailed upon the Government to sustain them, but we do want the\r\nyoung men encouraged to do military duty and be prepared for action when\r\nit comes. The only money, therefore, that the Government need expend to\r\nprotect our continent is a good militia force in each of the various\r\nStates, to be well disciplined. In that case our country will be\r\nprepared to meet foreign foes.\r\n\r\nI am also opposed to a large standing naval force, not only on account\r\nof the expense, but also because our country is less likely to get into\r\ntrouble with other nations, providing we have no ships to send into\r\ntheir waters. Naval officers are often very impetuous and chivalrous and\r\nsometimes fancy they have grievances to repel, which are largely\r\nimaginary, and with them it is a word and a blow.\r\n\r\nWith a thoroughly equipped and largely efficient naval force, we might\r\nthus not unlikely be driven into a conflict without cause or reason with\r\nsome friendly power. Our country is happily located far in the distance\r\nfrom the quarrelling nations of Europe, and our being so removed is our\r\nprotection. It is not desirable to be brought in closer contact by\r\nsending our naval vessels into their waters, to be under their fire. The\r\npolicy of this nation is peace and good will to all mankind. What gain\r\nwould it be to America to have a conflict with England, even though we\r\nshould conquer in the end, or France, or Germany, or Russia? We couldn’t\r\ntow any of these countries to ours, nor could we hold on to our conquest\r\nas a permanent possession; neither should we desire to do so, as we have\r\nterritory enough in the 38 States which comprise the United States of\r\nAmerica, already, without desiring to annex that of any of our far-off\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nAnd if an emergency should arise in what has been called the last resort\r\nof kings, namely, the necessity of going to war, it would be found that\r\nthe importance of this training in the special business of war could\r\nthen be appreciated at its true value.\r\n\r\nThe importance of business training, that is, training for the special\r\noccupation in which a man’s energies are to be developed, is always made\r\napparent when those energies are put to the test of competition, or are\r\ncalled upon to put forth an extraordinary effort. If a man has not got\r\nthe special training, whether in the army or in civil life, he is never\r\nreliable in an emergency, but is like that weak and vacillating friend\r\nwhich old Solomon compared to a broken ankle.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, to the young man of the rising generation, while you\r\ndon’t relax any effort to procure all the education that your time and\r\nmeans will afford, above all things, don’t neglect the paramount\r\nimportance of business training.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n      PERSONAL HONOR OF WALL STREET MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREACH OF TRUST RARE AMONG WALL STREET MEN.—THE ENGLISH CLERGYMAN’S\r\n    NOTION OF TALMAGE’S TIRADES AGAINST WALL STREET.—ADVENTUROUS THIEVES\r\n    HAVE NO SYMPATHIZERS AMONG WALL STREET OPERATORS.—EARLY TRAINING\r\n    NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN SPECULATION.—FERDINAND WARD’S EVIL\r\n    GENIUS.—A GREAT BUSINESS CAN ONLY BE BUILT UP ON HONEST\r\n    PRINCIPLES.—GREAT GENERALS MAKE POOR FINANCIERS, THROUGH WANT OF\r\n    EARLY TRAINING.—PRACTICAL BUSINESS IS THE BEST COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no place in the world where people are trusted so much on faith\r\nas they are in Wall Street; not even in the Church.\r\n\r\nThe business is one of mutual confidence, and each day there are\r\nnumerous opportunities for men to secure many millions of dollars of\r\nother people’s money and take themselves safely off to that Paradise of\r\ndefaulters and absconders over the Border. Yet instances of this nature\r\nare comparatively rare when we consider the large number of transactions\r\nand the immense amount of money handled in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThe men of Wall Street have, therefore, become world-renowned for\r\nstraightforward dealing, and have thus obtained the first position as\r\nleading spirits in the speculative affairs not only of their own\r\ncountry, but of the entire world. Wherever the speculative spirit of the\r\nage has obtained a foothold, there Wall Street is a household word, and\r\nWall Street men are held in the highest esteem. It has become a term\r\nfamiliar to the ears of those even who know nothing about the business\r\nwhich has made its name almost universal.\r\n\r\n“What is that Wall Street?” said an English curate to a friend of mine\r\nwho recently visited Liverpool. “What a queer place,” he continued, “for\r\nMr. Talmage to have his Tabernacle.”\r\n\r\nThe English divine, evidently only having “caught on” to isolated\r\nsketches of the Brooklyn preacher’s calumnious invectives, thought they\r\nwere actually delivered among the bulls and bears, and that Talmage had\r\nthe boldness to beard these ferocious animals in their den.\r\n\r\nIt is true the honor of Wall Street is sometimes slightly tarnished,\r\nespecially in the eyes of those who reside at a great distance, owing to\r\nthe occasional delinquencies of dishonorable men, who consider Wall\r\nStreet men and Wall Street money fair game for swindling operations.\r\nThese are for the most part outsiders, who pounce upon the Street as\r\ntheir illegitimate prey, after probably making a show of doing business\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThere is no place, of course, where confidence men have the opportunity\r\nof reaping such a rich harvest when they can succeed in establishing the\r\nconfidential relations that help them to secure their swag. But Wall\r\nStreet proper is not any more responsible for such men than the Church,\r\nwhose sacred precincts are used and abused by the same social pariahs in\r\na similar manner. The Street is the victim of these adventurers, and has\r\nno more to do with nurturing and aiding them than the Church has.\r\n\r\nWhat should be said of a financier who would have the temerity to assert\r\nthat the Church was an asylum for swindlers, and that thence they issued\r\nforth to commit their lawless depredations on society? He would be\r\ntabooed by all intelligent people. Yet there would be about as much\r\ntruth in such a statement as in most of the eloquent anathemas and\r\nobjurations launched from the pulpit every Sunday against Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThere is no place on this earth where adventurous thieves have fewer\r\nsympathizers than in Wall Street, except perhaps in Pinkerton’s and\r\nByrnes’ detective bureaux.\r\n\r\nThere is another popular delusion with regard to those who don’t succeed\r\nin Wall Street. Their failure is frequently attributed to sharp practice\r\non the part of the old habitues of the Street. People forget that the\r\nbusiness of speculation requires special training, and every fool who\r\nhas got a few hundred dollars cannot begin to deal in stocks and make a\r\nfortune. The men who don’t succeed are usually those who have spent\r\ntheir early life elsewhere, and whose habits have been formed in other\r\ngrooves of thought.\r\n\r\nThe business of Wall Street requires long and close training in\r\nfinancial affairs, so that the mind may attain a flexible facility with\r\nthe various ins and outs of speculative methods. If this training is\r\nfrom youth upward, all the better. It is among this class that many of\r\nour most successful men are to be found, though there are some eminent\r\nexamples of success among those who began late in life. It will be\r\nfound, however, that the latter must have a special genius for the\r\nbusiness, and genius, of course, discounts all the usual conditions and\r\nauxiliaries; but among ordinary intellects early training is generally\r\nindispensable to financial success.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens, moreover, that the early trained man from youth up\r\ndoes any great wrong.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Ward may seem an exception to this rule, but he had a born\r\ngenius for evil, and though he had all the early advantages of Timothy\r\nand Samuel the Prophet, with a higher civilization thrown in, so utterly\r\nincorrigible was his nature that nothing but prison walls and iron bars\r\ncould prescribe bounds to his rascality. He is an extraordinary\r\nexception, a genius of the other extreme, against whose subtle\r\noperations society must always be on its guard; but he is only one of\r\nthe dangerous exceptions that prove the rule for which I am contending,\r\nthe rule that early training in finance more, perhaps, than in any other\r\nfield of human energy, is the great desideratum.\r\n\r\nIf such a man is unsuccessful, dishonor seldom accompanies his\r\nmisfortunes. He may pass through the whole catalogue of financial\r\ndisasters and their natural results. He may fall to the gutter through\r\nover-indulgence in liquor and the despair attendant on a run of bad lack\r\nor unfortunate connection with wicked partners, but he is still capable\r\nof rising from the very ashes of his former self. He will never stoop to\r\nswindle, no matter how low the rest of his moral condition may be\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nNo great business can be built up except upon honest and moral\r\nprinciples. It may flourish for a time, but it will topple down\r\neventually. The very magnitude to which the business of Wall Street has\r\ngrown is a living proof of its moral stamina. It is impossible, in the\r\nsocial and moral nature of things, to unite a large number of men,\r\nrepresenting important material interests, except on principles of\r\nequity and fair dealing. A conspiracy to cheat must always be confined\r\nto a small number.\r\n\r\nThe most successful men of Wall Street, to my own personal knowledge,\r\nare those who came to the Street young and have “gone through the mill,”\r\nso to speak; those who have received severe training, who have had some\r\nsledgehammer blows applied to their heads to temper them, like the\r\nconversion of iron into steel.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the prerequisites of a successful financial career.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common delusions incident to human nature in every walk\r\nof life is that of a man who has been successful in one thing imagining\r\nhe can succeed in anything and everything he attempts. In general,\r\noverweening conceit of this kind can be cured by simple experiments that\r\nbring men to a humiliating sense of their mortal condition and limited\r\ncapacity. When the experiment is tried in Wall Street, however, to these\r\nhealthy admonitions are frequently added irreparable disaster and\r\noverwhelming disgrace.\r\n\r\nI shall note a few examples within the memory of newspaper readers still\r\nliving. The brief panic of 1884 brought several instances of this\r\ncharacter to the surface. Some of them had fought our battles for\r\nnational existence and preserved the Union when this achievement seemed\r\nalmost hopeless. Their fame as generals was as extensive as history\r\nitself. They had planned and executed projects with success on which the\r\ndestiny of a great nation, and perhaps the destiny of other nations, had\r\nimpended, yet when they attempted to manage banks, railroads and\r\nfinancial operations they became hopelessly entangled.\r\n\r\nThe great captain of the Union’s salvation was as helpless as a babe\r\nwhen Ferdinand Ward and James D. Fish moved upon his works. The eye that\r\ntook in the whole situation at a glance at Vicksburg, Richmond and\r\nAppomatox was totally unable to penetrate the insidious and speculative\r\ndesigns of the “Young Napoleon of finance.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was a victim, not so much to the sincere, veracious and\r\nunsuspecting attributes which were so largely predominant in that great\r\nman, as to his want of early training in financial business affairs, and\r\nto the fact that he was unable to appreciate its necessity in dealing\r\nwith sharp business men of loose morals. Generals Winslow and Porter\r\nfell into a similar error of judgment in the West Shore Railroad matter.\r\nTheir mistake came near being a serious blow to the railroad interests\r\nof this country. General Wilson, of the New York and New England, and\r\nGeneral Gordon were similarly unfortunate. The common mistake committed\r\nby these worthy men, to whom the country owes an inestimable debt of\r\ngratitude, was the chief cause of the “general demoralization,” to which\r\nTreasurer Jordan facetiously but indignantly alluded when denouncing\r\nrailroad methods, and which from time to time has played sad havoc with\r\nsome of the best securities in the country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I say to all who have sons destined for a business career,\r\nlet your cherished offspring have the advantage of early practical\r\ntraining in the particular line of business for which you may consider\r\nthem best adapted, and do so, even to the partial neglect of their\r\nschool and college education. Practical business is the best school and\r\ncollege in which they can possibly graduate. I shall attempt to make\r\nthis point clearer in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SALMON P. CHASE,\r\n  Secretary of the U. S. Treasury during the war period.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n          WALL STREET DURING THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIERS OF WALL STREET ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT IN THE HOUR OF THE\r\n    COUNTRY’S PERIL.—THE ISSUE OF THE TREASURY NOTES.—JAY COOKE’S\r\n    NORTHERN PACIFIC SCHEME PRECIPITATES THE PANIC OF 1873.—WALL STREET\r\n    HAS PLAYED A PROMINENT PART IN THE GREAT EVOLUTION AND PROGRESS OF\r\n    THE PRESENT AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street came to the rescue of the country when the war broke out.\r\nThe Government then did not have money enough to pay the interest on the\r\ndebt, and was sorely embarrassed for a time. The Hon. S. P. Chase,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, sent word to Mr. Cisco, the Sub-Treasurer in\r\nNew York, to do everything in his power to raise the money required to\r\nsustain the nation’s credit.\r\n\r\nMr. Cisco apprised the “Street” of the instructions he had received from\r\nWashington concerning the empty condition of the Treasury. He showed a\r\nnumber of the leading operators and financiers that within a few days\r\nthe interest on the accruing obligations would have to be paid, or the\r\nGovernment paper should go to protest. It was clearly demonstrated that\r\nif funds could not be raised the Government should be placed in a\r\nperplexing position, that would, in all probability, greatly complicate\r\nand prolong the struggle for national existence. It was one of the most\r\ncritical moments in the whole history of the Republic, and the emergency\r\nrequired clear, decisive judgment, and promptitude of action.\r\n\r\nWall Street men perceived the gravity of the situation at a glance. If\r\nthe Government’s credit should collapse, it was feared that the whole\r\nframework of our political system would be endangered.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all securities was threatened with a destructive\r\nupheaval, and most serious consequences were likely to ensue, menacing a\r\ncontraction of all values. The prospect was very dark. Not a ray of hope\r\nshone through the sombre clouds that hung dismally over the Union. The\r\ninternal dissensions of our people, and the apparent destruction of our\r\nnational life, were watched with the deepest interest by European\r\nfriends and foes—the latter being then largely in the majority, and only\r\nwaiting a favorable opportunity to pounce upon what they considered\r\ntheir destined prey.\r\n\r\nManifest destiny seemed to have leagued all her forces in opposition to\r\nus. The stoutest hearts quailed at the prospect of our dissolution as a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAt this momentous juncture, when there was no eye to pity, and when no\r\nother arm seemed mighty enough to save, the Wall Street men were equal\r\nto the occasion. They put their heads together, came to the front, and\r\nresolved to extricate the Government from its perilous position. It is\r\ntrue that they were well paid for it. They charged twelve per cent. for\r\nthe loan, but that was nothing when the risk is taken into account. It\r\nwas then almost impossible to get a loan at any rate of interest. By\r\nsome of the great nations of Europe the risk then involved in such a\r\nloan was regarded in about the same light as the people of this country\r\nnow estimate the present chances for realizing on Confederate paper\r\nmoney, or Georgia bonds of the old issue.\r\n\r\nIn this state of public feeling, Lombard Street was not in a favorable\r\nmood to negotiate loans with this country, and, the whole fraternity of\r\nthe Rothschilds shut their fists on their shining shekels and shook\r\ntheir heads negatively and ominously at the bare mention of advancing\r\nmoney to the once great but now doomed Republic.\r\n\r\nMoney was dear at the time, and the Government was only obliged to pay\r\nwhat could have been obtained in other quarters. Curiously enough,\r\nprivate property then was considered better security than the Government\r\nendorsement, on the principle—which was not a very patriotic one, though\r\nin reality true—that the country could survive its form of government.\r\nThat form, however, the best the world has yet seen, survived the shock\r\nand maintained its autonomy. That it did so was in a large measure due\r\nto the prompt action of Wall Street men in raising the sinews of war at\r\nthe incipient stage of the rebellion. Had they failed to do so, it is\r\nnot improbable that the repulse at Bull Run might have proved a decisive\r\nblow to the Union, and plunged the country into a state of anarchy from\r\nwhich nothing but a despotism almost as bad could have retrieved it.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of this loan brought out the twelve per cent. Treasury\r\nnotes. After this issue the rates fell. Then came the 11 and the 10¾ per\r\ncent. issues, and subsequently the well-known and long to be remembered\r\n7 3-10 Treasury notes.\r\n\r\nAfter this issue had been popularized, successfully disposed of, and\r\nfinally taken up at maturity by the 5-20 loan, Jay Cooke was quick to\r\nissue, after their pattern, his famous 7 3-10 Northern Pacific Railroad\r\nbonds. Evidently he had a patent for negotiating that famous 7 3-10 per\r\ncent. railroad loan, as almost every clergyman, Sunday-school teacher\r\nand public benefactor were found to have invested in them, when the\r\ncrash came, and although the road was the means of his financial\r\ndownfall, with the ruin of an innumerable number of others besides, who\r\nwere dragged into the same speculative whirlpool, this unfortunate event\r\nwas not entirely an unmixed evil.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this was the main and visible cause of precipitating the\r\npanic of 1873, of which I shall speak more fully in another chapter, but\r\nthe Pacific road was the great pioneer in opening up the Far West, and\r\ndeveloping its material resources, the great artery of the Western\r\nrailroad system, conveying vigorous and durable vitality to the\r\nindustrial life of the expansive regions beyond the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThus, in taking a retrospect of my twenty-eight years in Wall Street, I\r\nfind that what sometimes appeared to be great evils have been succeeded\r\nby compensating good, fate counter-balancing fate, as the Latin poet has\r\nit. It was so, as I have previously observed, after the panic of 1857.\r\nIt was so after the convulsion of 1873, and though I have only historic\r\nevidence to guide me in regard to the earlier history of the Street, I\r\nfind it was so after 1837. So, the maxim that history repeats itself has\r\nbeen fully verified in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nSo, now that I have relapsed into a reflective mood on this subject, a\r\nhost of important associations connected with the main issue rush upon\r\nme. The prominent idea that stands out in bold relief is the rapid and\r\nwonderful progress made in Wall Street during the period that I have\r\nundertaken to chronicle. And not only so, but the rapid strides that\r\nhave been made in everything, almost universally, during that time,\r\npresent a vast theme for consideration. The part that Wall Street men\r\nhave taken in this mighty evolution is the topic that concerns me most\r\nat present. As I attempt to progress with my subject, I observe this\r\ndivision of it becoming more expansive, so that I find myself in the\r\nposition of the Irishman when he ascended to the top of a mountain.\r\nAfter recovering from the first effects of his surprise, he exclaimed:\r\n“I never thought the world was so large!”\r\n\r\nSo it is with me. I never thought that Wall Street was so big, nor that\r\nWall Street affairs were so extensive, until I began to write about\r\nthem. They expand, as well as improve, surprisingly on closer\r\nacquaintance. I only hope I shall be able to impress this idea more\r\nvividly on the minds of my clerical friends, and others who have been\r\nmisguided in this respect, chiefly on hearsay and irresponsible\r\nevidence, and who, I am sorry to say, have been the well-meaning, but\r\nover-zealous instruments of misleading others.\r\n\r\nTo come to an approximate deduction of facts, then, it is, I think, a\r\nfair estimate of the general progress of humanity, to say that there has\r\nbeen greater material advance in everything that relates to a higher\r\ncivilization, and the greatest good to the greatest number, during the\r\nlast thirty years, than in all the previous time that has elapsed since\r\nthe period that the father of history, old Herodotus, began to\r\nchronicle, in his racy style, the real and imaginary events of the human\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe part that Wall Street has played in this amazing progress has been\r\ncomparatively large, and would, if thoroughly investigated and fully\r\ndiscussed, make a larger book than I have time to write at present.\r\n\r\nI can only glance at the prominent topics and leading events in the\r\nextensive and somewhat sensational history of Wall Street, and sketch\r\nbriefly the conspicuous features in the lives of certain celebrities who\r\nhave been conspicuous in the history of speculation, and of those who\r\nhave been prominent in the financial affairs of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    MORE WAR REMINISCENCES—BRITISH AND NAPOLEONIC\r\n                            DESIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW NAPOLEON DEFIED THE MONROE DOCTRINE.—THE BANQUET TO ROMERO.—SPEECHES\r\n    BY EMINENT FINANCIERS, JURISTS AND BUSINESS MEN.—THE ELOQUENT\r\n    ADDRESS OF ROMERO AGAINST FRENCH INTERVENTION.—NAPOLEON SHOWS HIS\r\n    ANIMUS BY DESTROYING THE NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING THE REPORT OF THE\r\n    BANQUET.—THE EMPEROR PLOTTING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ENGLISH\r\n    PARLIAMENT TO AID THE CONFEDERATES AND MAKE WAR ON THE UNITED\r\n    STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were other critical periods during the war when Wall Street came\r\nto the front, besides the one in which it rendered such timely aid to\r\nthe Government in its financial embarrassment. One of these was when the\r\nEmperor of the French, Napoleon III., showed his cloven foot and\r\nexhibited anew the rancorous disposition which ten years previously had\r\ncrushed the Republican hopes of La Belle France by the murderous _Coup\r\nd’Etat_. He made a bold attempt to plant that blood-stained foot on this\r\nfair soil, in open defiance of the Monroe doctrine, and to crush the\r\nliberties that his immortal uncle, even in the full flush of his great\r\nconquests, dared not attack and was forced to respect.\r\n\r\nI shall here relate an incident of this period, which, I think, has not\r\nobtained the prominence in our national history to which, I believe, it\r\nis justly entitled.\r\n\r\nSenor Romero, then Mexican Minister at Washington, was invited to a\r\npublic dinner in New York, in order that proper occasion might be found\r\nto discuss the situation with regard to the intentions of Napoleon the\r\nLittle concerning Mexico, and with a view of preventing foreign\r\nintrusion, which was only the entering wedge for future invasion, at a\r\ntime when our nation was engaged in a family struggle to maintain its\r\nown existence, and demonstrate the durability of Republicanism.\r\n\r\nThe dinner, at which there was a grand manifestation of sympathy in\r\nfavor of the Mexican cause against French invasion, took place on the\r\nevening of March 29, 1864, at Delmonico’s, Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth\r\nstreet. The banquet was held in four of the largest rooms. The large\r\ndining hall was illuminated as a promenade for the families of the hosts\r\nand guests, and a large concourse of ladies and gentlemen who were\r\ninvited to see the table and be presented to the distinguished envoy.\r\nThe rooms were elegantly decorated with flowers, grouped and festooned\r\nwith artistic skill, and the doorways arrayed with fragrant wreaths and\r\ngarlands. One room was set apart for the orchestra, and Helmsmuller\r\nfurnished the music.\r\n\r\nSenor Don Juan N. Navarro, Consul-General of the Mexican Republic,\r\nIgnacio Mariscal, an eminent jurist of Mexico, and Don Fernando De La\r\nCuesta, Assistant-Secretary of the Legation, were invited guests.\r\nFollowing are the names of the Committee of Invitation:\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM C. BRYANT,\r\n    WILLIAM H. ASPINWALL,\r\n    HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    JOHN W. HAMERSLEY,\r\n    JONATHAN STURGES,\r\n    JAMES W. BEEKMAN,\r\n    J. J. ASTOR, JR.,\r\n    SMITH CLIFT,\r\n    W. E.

RUGGLES.\r\n\r\nHon. James W. Beekman presided. The stewards were John Jacob Astor, John\r\nW. Hamersley and Henry Clews.\r\n\r\nWhen full justice had been done to the large variety of sumptuous\r\ndishes, the chairman called the company to order, and explained that the\r\nobject of the meeting was to do honor to the great cause of religions\r\nand political freedom contended for by the Republic of Mexico. The chair\r\ngave the first regular toast, “The President of the United States,” and\r\ncalled upon David Dudley Field to respond, who did so in his usual\r\neloquent style, stating that the sentiment of the whole country was\r\nunited in sympathy with the cause of the Mexicans, and that the\r\nExecutive Department of the Government was simply the agent and exponent\r\nof the popular will. He dwelt at some length on the French invasion of\r\nMexico as one of the greatest crimes of the age, and predicted the brief\r\nreign of Maximilian. Mr. Field wound up his discourse with the following\r\ngrand peroration:\r\n\r\n    Maximilian may come with the Austrian eagle and the French\r\n    tricolor; he may come with a hundred ships; he may march on the\r\n    high road from Vera Cruz to the capital, under the escort of\r\n    French squadrons; he may be proclaimed by French trumpets in all\r\n    the squares of the chief cities; but he will return, at some\r\n    earlier or later day, a fugitive from the New World back to the\r\n    Old, from which he came; his followers will be scattered and\r\n    chased from the land; the titles and dignities which he is about\r\n    to lavish on parasites and apostates will be marks of derision;\r\n    the flag of the republic will wave from all the peaks of the\r\n    Cordilleras, and be answered from every mountain-top, east and\r\n    west, to either ocean; and the renewed country, purified by\r\n    blood and fire, will resume its institutions, and be free.\r\n\r\nThe second toast was, “Don Benito Juarez, Constitutional President of\r\nthe Mexican Republic,” to which Mr. Charles King, President of Columbia\r\nCollege, responded. He spoke of Mexico as the friend and ally of the\r\nUnion as opposed to European hostility.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, Senor Matias Romero, the honored guest of the evening,\r\nthen made a brilliant speech on the situation, from which I take the\r\nfollowing extracts:\r\n\r\n    “I am very happy to say that the kind of feeling you express for\r\n    Mexico is fully reciprocated. In Mexico there are now but the\r\n    sentiments of regard and admiration for the United States, and\r\n    the desire to pursue such a course as will draw more closely all\r\n    those powerful ties by which both nations should be united.\r\n\r\n    “The Emperor of the French pretends that the object of his\r\n    interference in Mexican affairs is to prevent the annexation of\r\n    Mexico to the United States; and yet that very thing would, most\r\n    likely, be ultimately accomplished if a monarchy were\r\n    established in Mexico. Fortunately for us, that scheme is by no\r\n    means a feasible one.\r\n\r\n    “We were willing to grant to the United States every commercial\r\n    facility that will not be derogatory of our independence and\r\n    sovereignty. This will give to the United States all possible\r\n    advantages that could be derived from annexation, without any of\r\n    its inconveniences. That once done, our common interests,\r\n    political as well as commercial, will give us a common whole\r\n    American continental policy which no European nation would dare\r\n    disregard.\r\n\r\n    “The bright future which I plainly see for both nations had made\r\n    me forget for a moment the present troubles in which they are\r\n    now involved. I consider these troubles of so transitory a\r\n    nature as not to interfere materially with the common destiny I\r\n    have foreshadowed; but, as they have the interest of actuality,\r\n    I beg to be allowed to make a few remarks in regard to them.\r\n\r\n    “Every careful observer of events could not help noticing, when\r\n    the expedition against Mexico was organized in Europe, that it\r\n    would, sooner or later, draw the United States into the most\r\n    serious complications, and involve them in the difficulty. The\r\n    object of that expedition being no less than a direct and armed\r\n    interference in the political affairs of an American nation,\r\n    with a view to overthrow its republican institutions and\r\n    establish on their ruins a monarchy, with a European prince on\r\n    the throne—the only question to be determined by the United\r\n    States and the other nations concerned, was as to the time when\r\n    they would be willing or ready to meet the issue thus boldly and\r\n    openly held out by the antagonistic nations of Europe.\r\n\r\n    “This, in my opinion, is the situation in which the United\r\n    States are placed with regard to Mexico. Taking into\r\n    consideration the well-known sagacity of American statesmen the\r\n    often-proved devotion of the American people to republican\r\n    institutions, and the patriotism and zeal of the Administration\r\n    that presides over the destinies of the country, I cannot\r\n    entertain the slightest doubt that the United States will act in\r\n    this emergency as will conduce to the best interests they and\r\n    mankind at large have at stake in the Mexican question.\r\n\r\n    “The United States may find that they are brought squarely to\r\n    the issue in the Mexican question sooner than they expected,\r\n    should the report, lately reached here, of any understanding\r\n    between Maximilian, as so-called Emperor of Mexico, and the\r\n    insurgents in this country, prove correct. The archduke, it is\r\n    stated, will inaugurate his administration by acknowledging the\r\n    independence of the South, and, perhaps, he will go further; and\r\n    this, of course, by the advice, consent and support of the\r\n    French Government, whose satellite, and nothing else, will the\r\n    archduke be in Mexico.\r\n\r\n    “Among the many events calculated to terminate immediately\r\n    French intervention in Mexico, the European complications which\r\n    threaten to cause a general war on that continent should be\r\n    particularly mentioned. It is certainly wonderful that while\r\n    Europe is in so insecure and agitated a condition, menaced by\r\n    revolutions everywhere, and wrestling to recover its own\r\n    existence and independence, the French Emperor should be\r\n    thinking about arranging other people’s affairs, as if his own\r\n    did not require his immediate and most particular attention.”\r\n\r\nMr. George Bancroft, the eminent historian, was next called upon to\r\nreply to the toast, “The Eminent Statesmen of Mexico,” among whom the\r\nchair named Guatimotzin, Hidalgo, Morelos, Ocampo, Lerdo and Degollado.\r\nMr. Bancroft said:\r\n\r\n                             MR. BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n    GENTLEMEN—Although I am not prepared to deliver an address\r\n    worthy of this auditory, I can not refrain from replying and\r\n    expressing my sentiments, as I have been called to reply to the\r\n    toast which our president has just proposed to the statesmen of\r\n    our neighboring sister republic. The struggle which for many\r\n    long years the Mexican people have sustained against their\r\n    interior tyrants has been an heroic struggle, worthy of a\r\n    civilized and cultivated people, and in which the sympathies of\r\n    the whole civilized world—of all the friends of political and\r\n    religious liberty—ought to have been manifested in a frank and\r\n    decided manner in behalf of the Mexican people, directed by the\r\n    liberal party. I believe, gentlemen, that the cause of civil\r\n    wars, not only in Mexico, but throughout all Spanish America,\r\n    has been the clergy alone, who, when they come to acquire power\r\n    in the State, always strive to overturn the government and to\r\n    subordinate the temporal interests of society to their own. This\r\n    attribute seems to belong principally to the Catholic clergy.\r\n\r\n    “The struggle, then, in which up to this time the patriotic\r\n    Mexicans have been engaged, was a holy struggle, and the\r\n    sympathy of the whole people of the United States was with\r\n    them—a people who, whatever may be their religious creeds,\r\n    adopts as a fundamental principle the most complete religious\r\n    liberty, and the absolute independence of the Church from the\r\n    State.\r\n\r\n    “But now the sympathy of the United States is increased for the\r\n    Mexican people, when, in addition to the facts already\r\n    mentioned, we find this people struggling for their independence\r\n    and nationality against a European nation, which, taking\r\n    advantage of the civil strife in which we were engaged, has\r\n    sought to establish before our eyes a form of Government in open\r\n    antagonism to our own. We can not do less than receive this\r\n    project in the same way as Europe would receive it, were we to\r\n    foment revolutions and establish republics on that continent.\r\n\r\n    “Then it is that those statesmen in the United States who aid us\r\n    to emerge from our present difficulties, and to restore our\r\n    power and legitimate influence, and those who in Mexico not only\r\n    consummate the great work of establishing religious liberty on a\r\n    solid basis, but who succeed in driving from their country the\r\n    foreign invader, or at least keep the sacred fire of patriotism\r\n    and of resistance to the invader burning, while we disembarrass\r\n    ourselves of our complications, deserve, in the highest degree,\r\n    our success and ardent homage.\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, the Egyptians used to place a burning lamp at the\r\n    feet of their royal corpses. On descending the steep vaults in\r\n    which the corpses were deposited, the lamp was naturally\r\n    extinguished.\r\n\r\n    “Let Europe place at Maximilian’s feet the weak lamp of\r\n    monarchial power. It will not burn in the atmosphere of our\r\n    continent.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Cullen Bryant was then called upon, and said, in part:\r\n\r\n    “We of the United States have constituted ourselves a sort of\r\n    police of the New World. Again and again have we warned off the\r\n    highwaymen and burglars of the Old World who stand at the head\r\n    of its governments, styling themselves conquerors. We have said\r\n    to them, that if they attempted to pursue their infamous\r\n    profession here they did it at their peril. But now, when the\r\n    police is engaged in a deadly conflict with a band of ruffians,\r\n    comes this Frenchman, knocks down an unoffending bystander,\r\n    takes his watch and purse, strips him of his clothing, and makes\r\n    off with the booty. This act of the French monarch is as base,\r\n    cowardly and unmanly as it is criminal and cruel. There is no\r\n    person, acquainted, even in the slightest degree, with the\r\n    political history of the times, who does not know that it would\r\n    never have been perpetrated had not the United States been\r\n    engaged in an expensive and bloody war within their own borders.\r\n\r\n    “We thought that we saw the dawn of an era of enlightened\r\n    government in the administration of Juarez. That dawn has been\r\n    overcast by the clouds of a tempest wafted hither from Europe.\r\n    May the darkness which has gathered over it be of short\r\n    continuance; may these clouds soon be dispelled by the sunshine\r\n    of liberty and peace, and Mexico, assured of her independence,\r\n    take the high place which belongs to her in the family of\r\n    nations.” (Continued applause.)\r\n\r\nSenor Don Ignacio Mariscal responded to “Our Guest and the Bar of\r\nMexico.”\r\n\r\nMr. George Folsom, formerly envoy from the United States to the\r\nNetherlands, responded on behalf of the diplomacy, making special\r\nreference to Don Jose Lopez Uraga, Mexican Minister to Berlin.\r\n\r\nDr. Willard Parker responded to the health of Dr. Navarro, formerly\r\nChief of the Medical Staff of the Mexican Army.\r\n\r\nMr. George Opdyke responded on behalf of the merchants.\r\n\r\nSenor De La Cuesta replied to the Commerce of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. Jonathan Sturges spoke for the fine arts of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington Hunt spoke, protesting strongly against the French\r\ninvasion of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. Frederick De Peyster, President of the New York Historical Society,\r\nresponded on behalf of the historians of Mexico. He also made some\r\neloquent remarks on the tyranny of French intervention.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry E. Pierrepont spoke, as the representative of Brooklyn,\r\nagainst the French policy in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith Clift responded on behalf of the Bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Astor Bristed replied on behalf of the Literary Men.\r\n\r\nMr. William E. Dodge, Jr., spoke on behalf of the Young Men of America.\r\n“The tread of a French invasion,” he said, “is to them a direct insult,\r\nand were our own sad war over, I believe there is not a town, or\r\nvillage, or hamlet, where a full company would not spring to arms to aid\r\nour sister republic in her glorious struggle. I give, as a sentiment in\r\nwhich I know all will heartily join, the “Monroe Doctrine”-“Americans\r\ncan never allow the heel of European despotism to place its imprint upon\r\nthe soil of our Western continent.”\r\n\r\nThe Chair then said, “Let us now recognize the services of our\r\ncommissariat, who have so nobly discharged their stewardship. I propose\r\nthe health of the stewards. I beg Mr. John W. Hamersley to speak in\r\ntheir behalf.” Three cheers were then given for the stewards.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamersley delivered an eloquent address, from which I take the\r\nfollowing excerpts:\r\n\r\n    “It is hardly fair, sir, to call on us while our hearts are\r\n    beating with fervid thoughts, and your ears ringing with burning\r\n    words. Had this toast been on the programme, one of my\r\n    coadjutors would have prepared an address worthy of the\r\n    compliment and the occasion. This Committee was not chosen for\r\n    their gifts of utterance, but for those humbler tastes, which\r\n    only lend a grace to eloquence. Our duties are æsthetic,\r\n    industrial and artistic. We have compassed the ends of the\r\n    earth, the depths of the sea; we have levied contributions on\r\n    the four winds of heaven, to cluster here all that can tempt the\r\n    appetite, or fascinate the ear and eye, and we fancied our\r\n    mission accomplished.\r\n\r\n    “However, there is the post-prandial law; the despotism of the\r\n    wine cup, to which we all owe allegiance—the only despotism\r\n    which the descendants of the Huguenots, or Pilgrim Fathers, will\r\n    ever tolerate on this continent. We are here, sir, in menace to\r\n    none, but firmly and respectfully, in the majesty of manhood,\r\n    and in consciousness of power, to reassert a principle, imbibed\r\n    with our mother’s milk, a household word, a dogma of American\r\n    faith; but while we cordially grasp our neighbor’s hand, in the\r\n    darkest hour of her trial, the grasp has due emphasis and\r\n    significance.\r\n\r\n    “With her, we have kindred traditions; each of us has hewn an\r\n    empire from the wilderness; each of us has expelled the\r\n    oppressor; and both of us, with tattered banners drenched in the\r\n    gore of hero martyrs, are now appealing from treachery to the\r\n    God of Battles.\r\n\r\n    “We have a common future; for who can doubt that our successes\r\n    and the death-knell of treason is already rung?—who can doubt\r\n    that the triumph of our arms will be the signal for the eagles\r\n    of Austerlitz “to change their base,” from the pyramids of\r\n    Puebla for their perch on the towers of Notre Dame? And permit\r\n    me here, sir, to express a hope, suggested by the _season_ (God\r\n    grant it may be a prophecy), that the Easter chimes of Mexico,\r\n    of the coming year, with the glad tidings of a Saviour risen,\r\n    shall peal from sierra to sierra, from ocean to ocean, with the\r\n    glad tidings of a nation risen, a nation born again. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n    “Sir [to the Chair], it is fitting, while the accents of sweet\r\n    music recall tender and happy memories (man, imaged by that\r\n    armed cactus; woman, by that graceful palm), it is holy to\r\n    consecrate the hour to her who was “last at the cross and first\r\n    at the sepulchre.” I propose, sir, a toast, to which your\r\n    heart’s pulse will echo:\r\n\r\n    ‘The daughters of Mexico—Fair as her sons are brave.’”\r\n\r\n(Enthusiastic and prolonged applause. Music—_Viva Republica._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CHAIR.\r\n\r\n    “We must not permit the modesty of our banker and steward, Mr.\r\n    Clews, to outweigh our desire to hear from the Bourse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MR. HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN—Enough has already been said, in the\r\n    speeches made this evening, to indicate most conclusively the\r\n    depth of sympathy which pervades this community in behalf of the\r\n    cause of Mexico, and I rise to express my cordial concurrence\r\n    with the sentiments which have been avowed.\r\n\r\n    The unanimous and determined voices of this company clearly show\r\n    that public opinion in this country will not submit to the\r\n    encroachments of foreign powers upon any portion of the\r\n    territory of the continent.\r\n\r\n    The principles of free republican government are so strongly\r\n    implanted in the hearts of the people both of Mexico and the\r\n    United States, that they will never consent to surrender them.\r\n\r\n    “Human freedom and the rights of man make common cause between\r\n    Mexico and all other American States.\r\n\r\n    “I do not utter these words in prejudice against any government.\r\n    In my judgment, European nations will best promote the welfare\r\n    of their own people by carefully abstaining from all\r\n    interference with the declared will of those who dwell on this\r\n    continent.\r\n\r\n    “The doctrine has been solemnly asserted, and will be maintained\r\n    inviolate against all alliances which seek to impede the\r\n    progress of liberal institutions, or to impair the strength of\r\n    governments founded on the rights and intelligence of the\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    “This is the doctrine of the United States, and, under the\r\n    shield of its power and influence, the safety, prosperity and\r\n    independence of Mexico will be maintained and made perpetual.”\r\n    (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nThe meeting then separated, marching out to the inspiring strains of the\r\nMarseillaise.\r\n\r\nA few days after this meeting the House of Representatives unanimously\r\nresolved that the United States would never consent to the establishment\r\nof a monarchy which would arise under the auspices of Europe, upon the\r\nruins of a republic on the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe speeches at the Romero banquet, followed by this resolution, were\r\nthe premonitory sounds of the death knell of Maximilian’s empire, even\r\nbefore he took formal possession of his evanescent throne.\r\n\r\nTo show the animus of the Emperor regarding this meeting, and how\r\nclosely he was watching the struggle, I may state that when the New York\r\n_Herald_, which had a full account of the meeting, arrived in Paris it\r\nwas promptly seized by Napoleon’s censors and shared the fate of _La\r\nLantern_ and some of Victor Hugo’s most vigorous productions. It was\r\ncommitted to the flames on account of the speeches made by some of our\r\nrepresentative men. It will be seen by reference to this incident that\r\nour representatives in Wall Street were among the first to perceive this\r\nthreatened danger to the nation, and that they manifested their business\r\ntact and capacity in promptly meeting it. They acted literally on the\r\nmaxim of Sir Boyle Roche, that “the best way to shun danger is to meet\r\nit half way.”\r\n\r\nWall Street men were the first to make the move that checkmated the\r\ntyrant who was ambitious to prove before the eyes of the world that\r\nRepublicanism was a failure.\r\n\r\nA volume might be written by the student of universal history, and\r\nprobably will be by some future Herodotus, Macaulay, or Prescott, on the\r\nfar-reaching influences of this original move on the part of the Wall\r\nStreet men. There is a large field for speculative theorizing,\r\ncontaining much important truth in the way the Republican spirit was\r\nreflected in the political thought of Mexico, as the result of the\r\nfeeling manifested at this public dinner in New York. It was undoubtedly\r\nthe active precursor of the events that sealed the fate of that\r\nunfortunate cat’s paw, Maximilian. It gave birth to the idea that\r\nreverberated across the Atlantic, created distrust in Napoleon’s schemes\r\nof conquest as visionary with his own people, and alarmed their Teutonic\r\nfoes, who urged forward those mighty preparations that culminated in the\r\nterrible overthrow at Sedan.\r\n\r\nTo the mere reader of our local newspapers the connection between cause\r\nand effect of these great events may seem far-fetched, but it is all\r\nplain sailing to the student of general history.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it would be unjust to the genius of history to omit\r\nthe part which England played on the same chessboard with her former\r\npolitical refugee, constable and Imperial protégé. Although Mr. Disraeli\r\nhas done considerable justice to the case in Endymion, he has not dealt\r\nwith it from this side of the Atlantic. And I am now going to touch on\r\nsome points of hitherto unwritten history.\r\n\r\nThere was a secret alliance formed between Napoleon and the British\r\nCabinet—an international conspiracy on a large scale—to demolish the\r\nliberties of this country, pounce upon the wreck and then share the\r\nspoils between these two powerful pirates. How this was planned and\r\nsubsequently averted would form, if fully written up, one of the most\r\ninteresting chapters in the voluminous library of statecraft, and would\r\ntake most of the political sensation out of the best efforts of\r\nMacchiavelli, Talleyrand and Prince Metternich. I can only glance at the\r\nleading features of the diabolical scheme, and show how Wall Street men\r\nwere again promptly in the breach at the proper moment.\r\n\r\nThe New York riots of 1863 were fomented by British, French and Southern\r\ninfluence combined, as a part of the villainous plot. The design was to\r\ngive our troops enough to do in quelling local riots, so that they\r\nshould have no opportunity of going to the front. Southern passion was\r\npredominant, and could not discern at the time that their would-be\r\nallies were their bitterest enemies. It was hoped that the “draft riots”\r\nwould be so widespread as to afford Southern chivalry a chance to march\r\nunimpeded to Washington and capture the Capitol, when the allied foes of\r\nliberty, by virtue of their _entente cordiale_, should seize upon their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nEverything was in readiness for raising the blockade and pouring in\r\narmaments from Europe to complete the conquest. England had acted with\r\nmore caution than Napoleon, and was slow to move, though he was\r\nconstantly urging her forward. It is due to the villainy of his great\r\nconception to state, that, had he been able to move his more sluggish\r\nally in crime with greater celerity, the result might have been\r\noverwhelmingly disastrous to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n              FOREIGN INTRIGUES AGAINST AMERICAN LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nHOW THE IMPERIAL PIRATES OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND WERE FRIGHTENED OFF\r\n    THROUGH THE DIPLOMACY OF SEWARD.—OMINOUS APPEARANCE OF THE RUSSIAN\r\n    FLEET IN AMERICAN WATERS.—NAPOLEON AIMS AT THE CREATION OF AN EMPIRE\r\n    WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI, AND THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD FRENCH\r\n    COLONIES.—PLOTTING WITH SLIDELL, BENJAMIN, LINDSAY, ROEBUCK AND\r\n    OTHERS.—URGING ENGLAND TO RECOGNIZE THE CONFEDERACY.—DISRAELI\r\n    EXPLAINS ENGLAND’S DESIGNS AND DIPLOMACY.—AFTER THE NAVAL VICTORY OF\r\n    FARRAGUT, AND THE CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS ENGLAND HESITATES THROUGH\r\n    FEAR, AND NAPOLEON CHANGES HIS TACTICS.—RENEWAL OF INTRIGUES BETWEEN\r\n    ENGLAND AND FRANCE.—THEIR DASTARDLY PURPOSES DEFEATED BY THE\r\n    VICTORIES OF GETTYSBURG, VICKSBURG, AND THE GENERAL TRIUMPH OF THE\r\n    UNION ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the events related in the previous chapter were progressing\r\napparently towards a result that might have proved disastrous to the\r\ndearly purchased liberties of this country, the nation was saved by\r\ntaking advantage of a circumstance that was peculiarly providential to\r\nthe Union. The Russian fleet happened to be in South American waters at\r\nthe time. Secretary Seward was apprised of the fact by a Wall Street\r\nman. He was quick to act on the suggestion. Alexis, the brother of the\r\nEmperor, was in command of the fleet. Seward sent him a friendly\r\ninvitation, which he instantly accepted. The spies of Napoleon and of\r\nScotland Yard, who were always on the alert, and who always discerned\r\nthe evil side of everything, promptly informed their employers of the\r\nfact. The conclusion was manifest to European statesmen, who, unlike\r\nWall Street men, never “copper” the points given by spies. It seemed to\r\nthem clearly an alliance between the Great Empire and the Great\r\nRepublic. Extremes had met for mutual defence and safety probably for\r\naggressive purposes. The conspirators were frightened with their own\r\nshadows and foiled by their own cowardice, and an apparently imminent\r\ncalamity was thus simply averted.\r\n\r\nAs the designs of the two great European powers were craftily concealed\r\nthrough their evasive system of diplomacy, it has frequently been a\r\nsubject of debate as to whether they meant to take the part of the\r\nConfederacy for the purpose of dissolving the Union. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, to produce some tangible evidence of the intentions of these\r\nforeign potentates in the hour of our country’s greatest peril.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate records purchased by the Government some years ago throw\r\na ghastly light on this subject, and gravely warn us of the Scriptural\r\ninjunction, to put no trust in kings and rulers.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the officials of the Confederacy and the\r\nConfederate Commissioners, Slidell and Mason, at Paris and London, prove\r\nto a demonstration that the ruler of France and the rulers of Great\r\nBritain were making preparations on a large scale to take charge of this\r\ncountry as soon as the Union, through their diplomatic aid, should be\r\ndissolved. Letters from other representatives of the Confederates of\r\nEurope go to corroborate this view of the matter. The correspondence\r\nbetween Dudley, Post, Mann and Lamar, who were commissioners in various\r\nparts of Europe, and Judah P. Benjamin, the Confederate Secretary of\r\nState, is conclusive on the subject of European armed intervention,\r\nwhich has hitherto formed a topic of dispute in the historic circles of\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Slidell, who was on familiar relations with the\r\nEmperor of the French, gives the inside history of the intrigues of that\r\npotentate in such clear terms, that there can be no doubt of his\r\nintentions towards this country.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the superior vigilance of Mr. Dayton, the United\r\nStates Minister at Paris, several privateers would have been launched\r\nfrom French ports to prey upon the commerce of the United States, and to\r\ndo similar work to that for which the Alabama was fitted out.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the correspondence that the managers of the affairs\r\nof Great Britain were not so anxious to encourage the South as Napoleon\r\nwas; at least they succeeded in concealing their purpose better. The\r\npractical diplomacy of England in this affair was superior to that of\r\nFrance, though the latter has still held the palm for possessing better\r\ndiplomatic plotters, who are supposed to have no superiors outside the\r\nroyal associations of the reigning power of Russia.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that Napoleon was anxious to take positive\r\nsteps to recognize the South, while professing the most friendly\r\nfeelings in favor of the North, but he was afraid to act except in\r\nunison with Great Britain, and he failed to bring her to time until the\r\nfavorable moment for the execution of his plans had passed.\r\n\r\nSlidell and Mason went to Europe in January, 1862. This was perhaps the\r\ndarkest and most critical period for the cause of the Union during the\r\ngreat struggle. The Commissioners carried letters with them showing the\r\ninefficiency of the blockade of the Southern ports, the great\r\ndisadvantages and losses suffered by England and France through cutting\r\noff the cotton supplies, and setting forth the enormous advantages that\r\nwould result if free trade with the Confederacy were established. These\r\nwere strong arguments to arouse the spirit of commercial selfishness in\r\nfavor of the South.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious designs of Napoleon were of a very towering and extensive\r\ncharacter. He not only expected to recover Louisiana, which his uncle in\r\nan hour of necessity had sold to the United States, but he aimed at the\r\nrestoration of the entire old colonial empire of France on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was thoroughly posted in the affairs of this country. It\r\nseems that while he had resided in a small room in Hoboken, and took his\r\nmeals at a twenty-five cent restaurant, paying for them with money\r\nborrowed from French patriots, on the very slim prospect of reaching the\r\nthrone of France, he made the best use of his time, and he had studied\r\nthe history and geography of the United States and Canada with great\r\ncare and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn justice to his character for gratitude, however, it must be said, in\r\npassing, that, like young “Corneel” Vanderbilt, he paid all the money he\r\nborrowed, and placed some of his New York and Hoboken creditors in good\r\npositions at the Tuileries, under the Second Empire. He never forgot a\r\nfavor nor forgave an injury.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s knowledge of American affairs, as well as his ambitious\r\ndesigns, were briefly, but at the same time very fully disclosed, in\r\nconversation with Mr. Benjamin, at the Villa Eugenie, at Biarritz. “He\r\nturned with peculiar and undisguised eagerness,” said Mr. Benjamin, “to\r\nthe Mexican question. He knew the very number of guns on the Morro, the\r\nsums the United States had spent on the fortifications in Florida, the\r\nexports and imports of Galveston and Matamoras, in fact everything which\r\nwell informed local agents could have reported to an experienced\r\nstatesman eager for information. He examined me again on Texas and its\r\npopulation, the disposition of the French residents, the tendencies of\r\nthe German colonists, the feeling on the Mexican frontier. He observed\r\nthat Louisiana was nothing but French at the bottom. I was fully\r\npersuaded that he proposed to seek in Mexico a compensation for the lost\r\ncolonies in the West Indies, which, he said, could not be recovered,\r\n‘_sans nous brouiller avec nòs allies_,’ (without embroiling us with our\r\nallies). He insisted upon it that France must, sooner or later, have a\r\nfoothold (_pied à terre_) on the Florida coast, for the purpose of\r\nprotecting her commerce in the Gulf, for, he added, ‘_Nous ne voulons\r\npas d’un autre_ _Gibraltar de ce côté là_,’ (we don’t want another\r\nGibraltar on that side.”)\r\n\r\nMr. Slidell’s predecessor at Paris, Mr. Rost, had received assurance\r\nfrom the Duc de Morny, who was then next to the Emperor in his knowledge\r\nof State affairs, that the South would be recognized. It was only a\r\nquestion of time. After consulting with M. Thouvenel, Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs; Persigny, Minister of the Interior; Fould, Minister of\r\nFinance; Rouher, Minister of Commerce; Baroche, President of the Council\r\nof State; Mocquard, Private Secretary of the Emperor; Count Walewski, De\r\nMorny and others, Slidell was satisfied that the Emperor was all right,\r\nand he wrote to Jeff. Davis & Co. as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Emperor has invited the English Government to join with him\r\n    in recognizing the South, but the English Government, owing to\r\n    Earl Russell, has refused to act simultaneously with him.”\r\n\r\nThis statement of Slidell was true in one sense, but it was not strictly\r\nand diplomatically correct. There is no doubt that the English\r\nGovernment would have been anxious enough to join the Emperor in any\r\nscheme of conquest and spoliation that had a fair promise of success,\r\nand an average chance of avenging the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of\r\nBunker Hill, but both powers were playing at the game of diplomacy, each\r\nfor the purpose of making the other responsible for taking the\r\ninitiative in the recognition of the South. They were both very\r\ncircumspect about committing themselves, and the Palmerston-Russell\r\nCabinet, with that caution which always characterized old “Pam” in\r\nforeign affairs, would not recognize any suggestion from the Emperor\r\nthat did not bear his signature. The Emperor thought to make use of a\r\nMr. Lindsay, a wealthy shipowner and member of Parliament, to draw out\r\nthe English Government, but the latter was not to be committed to any\r\ncourse of policy that might involve important responsibilities in the\r\nfuture through any second-hand authority.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor seemed to have opened his mind very freely to Mr. Lindsay.\r\nHe told him that he would have taken steps to put an end to the blockade\r\nof the Southern ports if the English Ministry had intimated a\r\nwillingness to act with him. He said he had forwarded intimation to this\r\neffect through Mr. Thouvenel, but had not received a satisfactory\r\nanswer. He intimated that if England was ready, he was, and was prepared\r\nat once to despatch a formidable fleet to the Mississippi, on condition\r\nthat England should send an equal force to demand free ingress and\r\negress for their merchantmen, and for the cargoes of goods and supplies\r\nof cotton which were necessary to carry on the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was resolved to act, as he had always done, on the high ground\r\nof conferring universal favors on humanity.\r\n\r\nThis was an old trick in his family, but it did not work effectually\r\nthis time. He said he had regarded the restoration of the Union\r\nimpossible from the first, and for that reason had deprecated the\r\ncontinuance of the bloody contest, which could not lead to any other\r\nresult than separation. He authorized Mr. Lindsay to make this statement\r\nto Lord Cowley, and to ascertain whether he would recommend the course\r\nindicated to his Government.\r\n\r\nIt is very refreshing to reflect on the sensitive exhibition of feeling\r\ndisplayed, in his ostensible attempt to stop the carnage and fratricidal\r\nstrife, by the man who planned and directed the wholesale assassinations\r\nin connection with the sanguinary _Coup d’Etat_.\r\n\r\nMr. Lindsay reported back to the Emperor the substance of his interview\r\nwith Lord Cowley, who said that the English Government was not prepared\r\nto act until further developments. It was about this time that Mr.\r\nSeward was getting _in_ his fine diplomatic work with Earl Russell and\r\nPalmerston, which helped materially to upset the calculations of the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nNapoleon then requested Mr. Lindsay to see Palmerston, Russell, Derby\r\nand Mr. Disraeli, and to gather their intentions. He desired Mr. Lindsay\r\nto do all this of his own motion, and not as coming from him, and said\r\nhe did not wish to be embarrassed by the forms and delays of ordinary\r\ndiplomacy, because he felt the necessity of immediate action.\r\n\r\nLindsay again saw Earl Russell, as the accredited and special ambassador\r\nof the Emperor, _viva voce_. The Earl informed him that he could not\r\nreceive any communications from a foreign power, except through the\r\nregular diplomatic channel. He then sought an interview with Mr.\r\nDisraeli, who was much more affable and communicative than the little\r\nLord who stood so punctiliously on ministerial ceremony.\r\n\r\nDisraeli threw considerable light on the subject. After expressing a\r\ndeep interest in the affairs of the Confederacy, and saying that he\r\nfully concurred in the views of the Emperor, he told Mr. Lindsay that he\r\nhad good reasons for believing that a secret understanding existed\r\nbetween Earl Russell and Mr. Seward; that England, in the meantime,\r\nwould respect the Federal blockade and withhold recognition of the\r\nSouth. “But if France should take the initiative,” said Mr. Disraeli in\r\nconclusion, “any course she may adopt to put an end to the present state\r\nof affairs will undoubtedly be supported by a large majority in\r\nParliament, and knowing this, Lord Russell will give a reluctant assent\r\nto this, to avoid a change of ministry, which would otherwise certainly\r\nfollow.”\r\n\r\nThis shows that Disraeli saw very clearly through the duplicity of\r\nEnglish diplomacy, and that while England was profuse in her promises to\r\nMr. Seward, she was only waiting for the Emperor to act as pioneer in\r\norder that she might have a safe opportunity as well as a plausible\r\npretext for armed intervention.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor complained that Earl Russell had divulged his views on\r\nAmerican affairs, as expressed through his ambassador, to Mr. Seward.\r\nLord Russell placed himself squarely on the “fence,” to be prepared for\r\nany emergency. Finally, about the middle of April, the Emperor thought\r\nit would be best that he himself should make a friendly appeal to the\r\nFederal Government alone to open the ports, if England did not join him,\r\nwithout further hesitation. He thought it would be necessary, however,\r\nto accompany the appeal with a demonstration of force on the Southern\r\ncoasts; and if the appeal should be effective, to back it up by a\r\ndeclaration of his purpose not to respect the blockade. He determined,\r\nhowever, to wait a few days longer to see how England would act.\r\n\r\nThis resolution of the Emperor to make a friendly appeal to raise the\r\nblockade was only a thin excuse to find a cause for quarrel with the\r\nNorth, and it is very probable he would have acted on this determination\r\nalone, but for an unexpected event which changed his projects, and the\r\napparent course of history.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after this diplomatic conference, Commodores D. G.\r\nFarragut, and D. D. Porter, with their able commanders Bailey and Bell,\r\nhad made the famous passage of forts Jackson and St. Philip, at the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi, with the United States squadron, silenced the\r\nChalmette batteries and anchored in the harbor of New Orleans. After two\r\ndays’ parleying the city surrendered at discretion, or rather, the city\r\nauthorities passively and sullenly permitted Farragut, and afterwards\r\nGeneral Butler, to take possession of the city without shedding any\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThis great naval victory of Farragut’s squadron and its consequences\r\ndampened the ardor of the Emperor. He saw the chances of backing up his\r\n“friendly appeal” by a demonstration of force, were cut off, so far as\r\nNew Orleans and the forts of the Mississippi were concerned.\r\n\r\nYet, Napoleon did not totally relinquish the enterprise, on account of\r\nthis crushing defeat of the Confederacy. M. Billault, a prominent member\r\nof Napoleon’s cabinet, after this event said to Slidell, “The cabinet,\r\nwith the probable exception of M. Thouvenel, are in favor of the South.\r\nIf New Orleans had not fallen, our recognition could not have been long\r\ndelayed, but if the Confederates should obtain successes in Virginia and\r\nTennessee, and hold the enemy at bay a month or two longer, we may see\r\nan opportunity for intervention.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s intentions, however, were fully revealed in an autograph\r\nletter to General Forey, which was written in July and in which his\r\ngrasping ambition stood out in the boldest relief. He wrote: “In the\r\npresent state of civilization of the world, the prosperity of America is\r\nnot a subject of indifference to Europe, for she nourishes our\r\nmanufactures and gives life to our commerce. We are interested in having\r\nthe Republic of the United States a powerful and prosperous power, but\r\nwe are not willing to have that Republic take possession of the entire\r\nGulf of Mexico, command from there the Antilles as well as South\r\nAmerica, and monopolize the distribution of the products of the New\r\nWorld. To prevent this, a stable Government must be established in\r\nMexico, and we will in that event have restored to the Latin race on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic its power and prestige.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon completely overdid the thing in this letter to General Forey.\r\nThe vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other side\r\nstuck out too plainly. He showed that he wanted the whole earth, and\r\nthis aroused the resentment of the South. In the following August, M.\r\nTheron, a French consul in Texas, inspired by Napoleonic ideas of\r\nannexation, coolly contemplated the transformation of Texas to a French\r\nrepublic, and confided his project to Governor Lubbock of that State,\r\nwho apprised Jefferson Davis of the consul’s aspirations. This was too\r\nmuch even for the Confederate Government, and M. Theron and the French\r\nconsul at Richmond were both politely requested to leave the Confederate\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNapoleon persisted in his intrigues for the purpose of getting a\r\nfoothold in this country, in spite of the rebuff which his officious\r\nconsuls had received from the Confederacy. He expressed himself desirous\r\nof interesting some of the rest of the European powers in the cause of\r\nthe South, and again entered into confidence with Slidell on the\r\npossibility of joint mediation on the part of England, France and\r\nRussia. “My own preference,” said the Emperor, “is for a proposition for\r\nan armistice for six months, with the Southern ports open to the\r\ncommerce of the world. This would put a stop to the effusion of blood”\r\n(How tender-hearted he was!) “and hostilities would probably never be\r\nresumed. We can urge it,” he added, “on the high grounds of humanity,\r\nand the interests of the whole civilized world. If it be refused by the\r\nNorth, it will afford good reason for recognition, and perhaps for more\r\nactive intervention.”\r\n\r\nMr. Slidell then suggested that if the Emperor would give some kind of\r\nassurance that the police would not interfere, ships and munitions of\r\nwar might be sent from France to the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n“Why could you not have the ships built as if for the Italian\r\nGovernment?” suggested the Emperor. “I do not think it would be\r\ndifficult, but I will consult my ministers about it.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon then suggested the joint appeal for the six months’ armistice\r\nto England and Russia, which was declined by both. He then made a direct\r\noffer of mediation to the United States Government, in the most friendly\r\nterms, and on the “high grounds of humanity.”\r\n\r\nThe United States Government did not see it in this light, and rejected\r\nNapoleon’s humane offer.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate agents then obtained power to build ships of war in\r\nFrench ports, and to arm and equip them, and proceed to sea without\r\nmolestation from the French authorities, the Treaty of Paris forbidding\r\nsuch a hostile act against a friendly power like the North to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. The despot of France imagined himself above\r\nall treaties at that time.\r\n\r\nThe English Alabama was then cruising in a most successful manner. The\r\nEmperor had a conference with Mr. Arman, a large shipbuilder, and\r\nassured him that there would be no difficulty about building the ships\r\nfor the Confederates under the disguise of their Italian destination.\r\nAccordingly, a contract was made for building five ships of war at\r\nBordeaux and Nantes, and afterwards another contract for three iron-clad\r\nrams.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Emperor had a great deal of business on hand, but was still\r\nconvinced, amid all his diplomatic duties that the South should be\r\nrecognized by the European powers. He was afraid, however, of putting\r\nhis Mexican expedition in jeopardy by risking a rupture with the North.\r\nFinally, he said: “I will make a direct proposition to England for joint\r\nrecognition. This will effectually prevent Lord Palmerston from\r\nmisrepresenting my position and wishes on the American question.”\r\nAccordingly, he had an interview with those two worthy members of\r\nParliament, Messrs. Roebuck and Lindsay, at Fontainebleau, which was\r\nsaid to be highly satisfactory. He authorized them to state in the House\r\nof Commons that he was both willing and anxious to recognize the\r\nConfederate States, with the co-operation of England.\r\n\r\nThere was a great debate in Parliament on the subject, in the midst of\r\nwhich Earl Russell arose and said that Baron Gros, the French Minister,\r\nhad received no communication from his Government on American affairs.\r\nMr. Roebuck, who made the motion on the authority of the Emperor, was\r\nastonished that he had been so badly fooled. It still remains a mystery,\r\nhowever, why Baron Gros did not receive the advice in question from the\r\nEmperor, because M. Mocquard, the Emperor’s Secretary, wrote to Slidell\r\nas follows: “On the next day after the interview of Messrs. Roebuck and\r\nLindsay with the Emperor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs telegraphed\r\nBaron Gros to ‘officiously’ inform Lord Palmerston that, should Great\r\nBritain be willing to recognize the South, the Emperor would be willing\r\nto follow her in that way.”\r\n\r\nThe only explanation that seems plausible under these circumstances is,\r\nthat the Palmerston-Russell Cabinet interrupted this telegram to Baron\r\nGros for diplomatic purposes, or that the Baron, seeing that the debate\r\nin Parliament had taken an unfavorable turn, had prudently resolved to\r\nsuppress the advice from Napoleon, in order that his master might not\r\ncommit himself while England was not heart and soul with him in the\r\nenterprise. In fact, England had begun to see that she had taken a false\r\nposition, and Mr. Gladstone’s eloquent spurt, to the effect that\r\n“Jefferson Davis had created a nation,” was no longer the diplomatic\r\nfaith of England. She was more influenced by fear than love, as she\r\nalways is, and had begun to think, after the capture of New Orleans and\r\nthe destruction of the Confederate fleet, that the Federal Government\r\nwas capable of organizing a formidable navy. The London _Times_, which\r\nvoiced diplomatic sentiment then, said so. During this very debate on\r\nRoebuck’s motion, Lee’s army had been beaten at Gettysburg, Vicksburg\r\nhad surrendered and victory was beginning to perch on the Northern\r\nbanners everywhere. Napoleon also drew in his horns, complaining\r\nbitterly that “perfidious Albion” had gone back on him, and he was\r\nafraid to permit the war ships, when finished, to leave the French ports\r\nfor any destination, and when he permitted the English privateer, the\r\nRappahannock, to depart, it was under the injunction that the American\r\nminister should know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nWhat Lord Palmerston called a “concatenation of circumstances”\r\ncontributed largely to force the Emperor to change his policy towards\r\nthe United States. Maximilian’s Mexican expedition was exceedingly\r\nunpopular, trouble was brewing in several parts of the continent, and\r\nBismarck and Von Moltke were cunningly and deliberately weaving that net\r\nin which the Man of Destiny, seven years later, was hopelessly entangled\r\nat Sedan. His dream of a French American Empire beyond the Mississippi\r\nhad vanished long before his last abject act of humiliation in\r\nsurrendering the sword of France to Bismarck. And ere he died, a\r\nmiserable wreck of disappointed ambition, again a political exile, he\r\nhad the opportunity of seeing our own Republic, which he sought to\r\ndestroy, rehabilitated, and on its way to become the greatest nation in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE HON.

CHASE TOOK\r\n    OFFICE.—PREPARATIONS FOR WAR AND GREAT EXCITEMENT IN\r\n    WASHINGTON.—CHIVALROUS SOUTHERNERS IN A FERMENT.—OFFICIALS UP IN\r\n    ARMS IN DEFENCE OF THEIR MENACED POSITIONS.—MISCALCULATION WITH\r\n    REGARD TO THE PROBABLE DURATION OF THE WAR.—A VISIT TO WASHINGTON\r\n    AND AN INTERVIEW WITH SECRETARY CHASE.—DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT\r\n    THE SALE OF GOVERNMENT BONDS.—A PANIC PRECIPITATED IN\r\n    WALL STREET.—MILLIONAIRES REDUCED TO INDIGENCE IN A FEW\r\n    HOURS.—MIRACULOUSLY SAVED FROM THE WRECK.—HOW IT HAPPENED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Chase came into the Treasury he found that money was\r\nseriously needed. In fact the Treasury was empty. The expenditure for\r\nthe fiscal year ending June, 1861, was 62 millions, and there were only\r\n41 millions of revenue to meet them, and even this amount was threatened\r\nwith a serious reduction on account of the traitorous and rebellious\r\nattitude of the South.\r\n\r\nAfter President Lincoln had called upon Congress to provide for the\r\nenlistment of 400,000 men, the expenses of the Government were soon\r\nadvanced to the enormous amount of a million dollars a day. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury made a calculation, which he submitted to the\r\nPresident, showing that the probable expenditures would amount to 318\r\nmillions for the ensuing year. He advised that 80 millions be provided\r\nfor by taxation, 240 millions by loan, and that 50 millions of Treasury\r\nnotes, redeemable in coin on demand, should be issued.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary was authorized by Congress to borrow a sum not exceeding\r\n250 millions, on the credit of the United States, and as a part of this\r\nloan he was, in the words of the Act, “to issue in exchange for coin, or\r\npay for salaries or other dues from the United States, not over 50\r\nmillions of Treasury notes, bearing no interest, but payable on demand\r\nat New York, Philadelphia or Boston.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Chase advertised for bids on the bonds known as the 81 issue\r\nall bids at 94 and above were accepted, and those under 94 were\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nI got up a syndicate immediately to take the entire balance of the loan\r\nat 94, and went on to Washington to see the Secretary. This syndicate\r\ncomprised a number of New York banks and many large capitalists. I\r\ncalled upon Secretary Chase when I arrived, informed him of the object\r\nof my visit and made him an offer of 94 for the entire balance of the\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nHe was in favor of the proposition, but requested me to leave the matter\r\nopen until the following morning for him to consider. It was a question\r\nwith him whether he ought not to give those whose bids had been rejected\r\nan equal opportunity with the parties I represented.\r\n\r\nI never can forget the impression I received on my approach to\r\nWashington that morning. As I looked through the window of the\r\nsleeping-car my eye was met by an entire train load of brass cannon.\r\nThere were at least a dozen platform cars, each having one of those huge\r\nguns, all apparently in order to wheel at once against the enemy. I\r\nshall always remember the feelings that came over me at that moment. The\r\nquestion of war or no war was vividly presented to my mind, and this was\r\nthe uppermost thought during my visit at Washington.\r\n\r\nI descended from my traveling quarters as soon as the train was\r\nannounced as having arrived at the capital, and repaired to Willard’s,\r\nthen the principal, if not, in fact, the only hotel for a traveler to go\r\nto, and it was an old-fashioned, historic hostelry. I hastened to my\r\nroom, rapidly performed my ablutions, and then found my way into the\r\ndingy breakfast room. On inquiry, I found that ten o’clock was the usual\r\nhour for heads of departments, including Mr. Chase, to be at the\r\nTreasury. At that hour I went to see him. I sent in my card and was\r\nushered into his presence without delay. He was a man of portly frame\r\nand distinguished bearing, and impressed me with the feeling of being in\r\nthe presence of an individual far above the average standard of humanity\r\nin every respect.\r\n\r\nI informed the Secretary of my mission, with the result above stated.\r\n\r\nAbout seven-eighths of the people of Washington, at that time, were\r\nSoutherners. The office-holders were largely composed of the latter, and\r\nthey were expecting to be suddenly turned out of office. This rendered\r\nthe place a boiling caldron of conspiracy and treason.\r\n\r\nAs I went around collecting information, the sight of those cannon that\r\nat first had made such an indescribable impression upon me, continued to\r\nhaunt my vision wherever I went. The air was filled with rumors of war,\r\nand everybody was wound up to the highest pitch of hostile excitement.\r\n\r\nAs I mingled among the people, the impression was forced upon me that\r\nwar was inevitable, and that up to the very hilt of the sword. I felt\r\nthat the contest would be long and bloody.\r\n\r\nI sent a dispatch to my firm in New York, conveying my impressions to\r\nthat effect, and advised them to clear the decks in preparation\r\ntherefor. I urged them to lose no time in selling off all the mercantile\r\npaper on hand, and requested them to communicate to the members of the\r\nsyndicate, which I had formed for the purchase of bonds, recommending\r\nthem to withdraw therefrom, as I was convinced that war to the knife was\r\nimminent, and that Government bonds must have a serious fall in price in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Chase the next morning, and told him that, as I believed,\r\nthere was going to be a long and bloody war, I could not\r\nconscientiously, in the interest of my clients, renew my bid of the\r\nprevious day.\r\n\r\nWith regard to my opinion about the probable length of the war, the\r\nSecretary took issue with me very firmly.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, however, afterwards proved to be a warm and most valued\r\nfriend of mine, and it was largely due to his aid and recognition that I\r\nachieved brilliant success in my early Wall Street career during the war\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary was of opinion that the bonds should command par, at\r\nleast, and they would be worth that and above it very soon, he thought.\r\nHe made this assertion on the expectation that the impending\r\ndifficulties would soon be adjusted, and that in less than sixty days\r\nall the trouble would be at an end.\r\n\r\nIt was not so extraordinary as it may seem to some people now, with the\r\nlight of later events fully before them, that the Secretary was so\r\nsanguine of short work being made of the South, because he only shared\r\nthe opinion of a large number of people, who greatly underestimated\r\nSouthern durability.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Secretary, who treated me with great consideration, as\r\nhe did every one in his inimitable and dignified manner, which made such\r\na durable and favorable impression on all who came in contact with him,\r\nI felt greatly pleased and highly gratified at meeting him. In fact, his\r\nfine, magnetic presence was of a character to command the admiration of\r\nalmost every person who had the honor of an interview. He was a great\r\nman for producing good first impressions, and, unlike many impressions\r\nof this character they were generally lasting.\r\n\r\nHad I not visited Washington at the time I did, and had I not obtained\r\nthe correct impression concerning the future of the then impending\r\ndifficulties, my firm, like many others that invested in Government\r\nbonds, mercantile paper, stocks and other fluctuating properties, would\r\nhave been irretrievably ruined. I have reason to congratulate myself,\r\ntherefore, on my good fortune in narrowly escaping such a disaster,\r\nalmost at the beginning of my Wall Street career, as I was thus enabled,\r\nat a later stage of the national trouble, to be of considerable service\r\nto the Government, through the Treasury, in its efforts to sustain such\r\nan army in the field as was calculated to ensure success to the Federal\r\narms.\r\n\r\nMy first experience in dealing in Government bonds was just prior to the\r\nLincoln administration, when Mr. Cobb was Secretary of the Treasury. He\r\nadvertised for sale to the highest bidders an issue of U. S. bonds\r\nbearing five per cent. interest, having twenty years to run, and my firm\r\nbid for $200,000 of them, hoping to make a quick turn, and a small\r\nprofit thereon. A five per cent. deposit was made, as required by\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nThe loan was all awarded to most of the bids, mine included, and a very\r\nlarge part of it was awarded to Lockwood & Co., who were then regarded\r\nthe largest and most prosperous Stock Exchange firm in the street.\r\n\r\nGeorge S. Robbins & Co., John Thompson, Marie & Kans, and a few others,\r\nwhose names I now forget, made also large bids.\r\n\r\nOf those mentioned, however, my firm stood alone in taking up the bonds,\r\nas the threatening aspect of political affairs came on so soon\r\nafterwards as to depreciate Government securities. The original deposit\r\nof five per cent. was lost by these subscribers, and the bonds were\r\npermitted to remain in _statu quo_, as the Government never forced the\r\nclaim against the delinquents.\r\n\r\nThis, in a large measure, accounted for the impoverished condition of\r\nthe Treasury when Mr. Chase took charge of it, and for which Mr. Cobb\r\nhas been made an object, not wholly undeserving, of public reproach.\r\n\r\nThe $200,000 bonds my firm subscribed for at par were sold mostly at 95\r\nand below, but the fact of taking them, and meeting the subscription,\r\nwithout fail, gave my firm an excellent standing with the Government at\r\nthe beginning of the war, and enured greatly to my firm’s advantage\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nAt the time I visited Washington my firm was more largely engaged in\r\ndealing in mercantile paper than any other branch of Wall Street\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nI had inaugurated the system at the time of my advent to the “Street” of\r\nbuying merchants’ acceptances and receivables out and out, the rate\r\nbeing governed by the prevailing ruling rate for money, with the usual\r\ncommission added.\r\n\r\nIt was by this method that my firm soon became the largest dealers in\r\nmercantile paper, which business had formerly been controlled by two\r\nother firms for at least a quarter of a century, and whose old fogy\r\nmethods were by my innovations easily eclipsed.\r\n\r\nThe merchants at that time would go to these discount firms and leave\r\ntheir receivables, bearing their endorsements, on sale there, and only\r\nwhen sold by piecemeal could they obtain the avails thereof.\r\n\r\nThe more expeditious plan that I adopted, which was to give these\r\nnegotiators a check at sight, seemed generally to merit their\r\napprobation, and enabled me to command the situation in that line of\r\nbusiness, very much to the chagrin of my competitors.\r\n\r\nIn this way my firm had accumulated about five hundred thousand dollars\r\nin notes, which were hypothecated with various city and country banks.\r\n\r\nAfter coming to the conclusion above referred to on my visit to\r\nWashington, in regard to the certainty of a prolonged and desperate war,\r\nI made quick steps back to New York to dispose of my paper. I went\r\nvigorously to work, and succeeded in unloading all but ten thousand\r\ndollars of short time notes made by Lane, Boyce & Co., and a note of\r\n$500 of Edward Lambert & Co.\r\n\r\nI had no sooner accomplished this very desirable work of shifting my\r\nburden, and distributing it in a more equable manner on the shoulders of\r\nothers, but at higher rates than I paid, than in less than a week after\r\nmy return from Washington the exciting news arrived of the firing of the\r\nfirst hostile gun at Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of this overt act of war spread like wildfire, and the\r\nwildest scenes of excitement and consternation were witnessed in Wall\r\nStreet and throughout the entire business community. The whole country\r\nwas panic stricken in an instant.\r\n\r\nStocks went down with a bound to panic prices. Fortunes were lost, and\r\nmillionaires were reduced to indigence in a few hours. Money was\r\nunobtainable, and distrust everywhere was prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe two firms whose paper I was unable to dispose of were about the\r\nfirst to fail, and before the maturity of any of the balance of the\r\npaper which I had successfully negotiated both the drawers and endorsers\r\nthereon, without a single exception, all collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe height which Gilroy’s kite attained would have been nowhere in point\r\nof altitude to that which I should have reached had I not had the good\r\nluck to have cleared my decks as I did, and in the nick of time.\r\n\r\nMy safety in this instance was due to my inspiration, to which I believe\r\nmyself more indebted than anything else for the privilege of remaining\r\nin Wall Street up to the present date.\r\n\r\nI am no spiritualist nor theosophist, but this gift or occasional\r\nvisitation of Providence, or whatever people may choose to call it, to\r\nwhich I am subject at intervals, has enabled me to take “points” on the\r\nmarket in at one ear and dispose of them through the other without\r\nsuffering any evil consequences therefrom, and to look upon these kind\r\nfriends who usually strew these valuable “tips” so lavishly around with\r\nthe deepest commiseration. My ability to do this, whatever may be its\r\nsource, whether human or divine, has saved me from being financially\r\nshattered at least two or three times annually.\r\n\r\nI do not indulge in any table tapping or dark seances like the elder\r\nVanderbilt, but this strange, peculiar and admonitory influence clings\r\nto me in times of approaching squalls more tenaciously than at any\r\nordinary junctures.\r\n\r\nI have known others who have had these mysterious forebodings, but who\r\nrecklessly disregarded them, and this has been the rock on which they\r\nhave split in speculative emergencies.\r\n\r\nTherefore I say again, beware of “points.” They constitute the _ignis\r\nfatuus_ which lure more unfortunate speculators to their financial doom\r\nthan all other influences put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

G. SPAULDING TAKES A PROMINENT PART IN THE\r\n    DISCUSSION ON THE BANK ACT.—THE ACT FOUNDED ON THE BANK ACT OF THE\r\n    STATE OF NEW YORK.—EFFECT OF THE ACT UPON THE CREDIT OF THE\r\n    COUNTRY.—A NEW SYSTEM OF BANKING REQUIRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Bank Act of 1863, improved by the Act of 1864, would\r\nrequire much larger space than I can devote to it in this book. I can\r\nonly glance at its salient points, and show its great influence, not\r\nonly on the finances of the country, but upon the destiny of the nation\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. E. G. Spaulding, who was one of the most prominent men in\r\ndealing with the financial questions of that period, has written and\r\npreserved a very full history of the legislation on the subject, and of\r\nthe interesting debates which preceded it.\r\n\r\nAfter the temporary loans had been negotiated to release the pressure\r\nupon the Government, Secretary Chase set his mind to consider the\r\nproblem of providing a currency without disturbing the business\r\norganization of the country.\r\n\r\nAt this period he was met by a fresh difficulty, in the suspension of\r\nspecie payments, which had been hastened by the arrest of Mason and\r\nSlidell, which, but for the wise policy of Mr. Seward, would have\r\nprecipitated a conflict with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1862 Congress authorized ten million more of demand notes. This\r\nwas followed by further issues, making in all 300 million United States\r\nnotes. Secretary Chase was at first opposed to making these notes a\r\nlegal tender for private debts, but in order to get the bill through, he\r\nagreed to the legal tender clause, as the Government was greatly in need\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary was also empowered by Congress to borrow 500 million\r\ndollars on 5-20 year 6 per cent. bonds, and also to obtain a temporary\r\nloan of 100 millions on condition that the interest on the bonds should\r\nbe paid in coin, and that the customs should be collected in coin for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first bill to provide a national currency secured by a pledge of\r\nUnited States bonds was introduced by Mr. Hooper, in July, 1862, but it\r\nwas not reported from the Committee to which it had been sent. At the\r\nmeeting of Congress in December the same year the financial problem had\r\nbecome still more complicated, and owing to the magnitude which the war\r\nhad then assumed, the expenses amounted to two millions a day.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1863, were 511\r\nmillions, and the expenditures were 788 millions, thus leaving a deficit\r\nof 277 millions.\r\n\r\nAll the financial wisdom of the Secretary was necessary in this dilemma.\r\nThe question was whether to provide for these 277 millions by a fresh\r\nissue of United States notes, or by interest-bearing loans.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary was opposed to increase the volume of the currency, saying\r\nthat the result would be the inflation of prices, increase of\r\nexpenditures, augmentation of debt, and ultimately disastrous defeat of\r\nthe very purposes sought to be attained by it.\r\n\r\nHe was in favor of an increase in the amount authorized to be borrowed\r\non the 5-20 bonds. He advised the creation of banking associations which\r\nshould secure their circulation by a deposit of Government bonds. One\r\nobject of this was to create a market for the bonds.\r\n\r\nCongress was not in favor of this proposition, and the bill of Mr.\r\nHooper was again offered in the following January, but was adversely\r\nreported from the Committee on Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nAnother new issue of 100 millions United States notes was ordered on\r\nmotion of Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, to meet the constantly\r\nincreasing needs of the army and navy.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln signed the joint resolution ordering the new issue with some\r\nreluctance, and sent a special message to the House, in which he\r\nexpressed his regret that it was necessary to add this last amount to\r\nthe currency while the suspended banks were free to increase their\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Senator Sherman offered a bill to provide a national\r\ncurrency, somewhat after the model of Mr. Hooper’s bill. The Sherman\r\nbill was passed before the end of February. This virtually secured the\r\npresent national banking system.\r\n\r\nIn order to show more clearly the nature of the national bank\r\nlegislation, and the prominent part taken by Mr. Spaulding and a few\r\nothers therein, Mr. Chase having been the directing mind, it is\r\nnecessary to make a brief resume of the action of Congress with the\r\nState banks in this connection.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1862, the banks applied to Secretary Chase to receive their\r\nnotes in payment for the bonds which he had for sale, but the Secretary,\r\nthinking that this would inflate the bank currency, refused the offer.\r\nYet the process of inflation went on until it increased from 130 to 167\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Spaulding advocated the National Bank Act on the ground that it\r\nwould provide a permanently improved bank currency, the Hon. Roscoe\r\nConkling, at that time in the lower House, opposed the policy of making\r\nwar upon the twelve hundred banks in the free States, and made a very\r\naffecting appeal for the orphans and widows who had stock therein. He\r\nproposed to issue 260 millions of seven per cent. bonds, payable in\r\nthirty-one years, to be exchanged for the bills of the suspended banks\r\nof New York, Philadelphia and Boston, and also to issue 200 millions of\r\nUnited States notes, payable in coin in a year. Mr. Conkling’s scheme\r\nwas assailed by Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, on the ground that it would\r\nsubject the national currency to the mercy of city bankers and brokers.\r\nOther eminent representatives stood up for the maintenance and integrity\r\nof the State banks, and notably Mr. Conkling opposed the measure\r\nvigorously, which was intended to tax the State banks out of existence.\r\n\r\nMr. Spaulding, who advocated the bill, was followed by Mr. Fenton in an\r\nable argument, showing the superiority of a currency secured by United\r\nStates bonds, and Senator Sherman explained the great evil occasioned by\r\nthe success attending the counterfeiting of the State bank notes.\r\n\r\nThese arguments seemed to be conclusive and overwhelming in the passage\r\nof the bill.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, to the honor of the State of New York, that\r\nthe National Bank Act was founded on the Banking act of this State,\r\nwhose chief features were a currency secured on public funds, and that\r\ndirectors and stockholders should be personally liable.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of this idea is attributed to Mr. Stillman, who is also\r\nthe well-known author of the “Stillman Act” to abolish imprisonment for\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThis bank act, which was especially engineered by the far-seeing\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, had almost a miraculous\r\neffect upon the credit of the country. It created a new and extensive\r\nmarket for United States bonds, which immediately advanced from 93 to\r\npar.\r\n\r\nAll the running expenses of the Government, accumulated with such\r\nrapidity, were paid from the sale of the 5-20’s within the short period\r\nof two months or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the Treasury report at the end of the year that “The\r\nBank Act at once inspired faith in the securities of the Government,\r\nand, more than any other cause, enabled the Secretary to provide for the\r\nprompt payment of the soldiers and the public creditors.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hugh McCulloch, the Comptroller of the Currency, saw room for\r\ncertain changes in the law, some of which were effected by Congress in\r\nthe first session of 1864. These changes were embodied in the Act of\r\nJune, 1864.\r\n\r\nThere was a long debate and strenuous opposition, in which Secretary\r\nChase deeply sympathized, against State taxation of the national banks,\r\nbut despite the opposition the taxation clause was carried.\r\n\r\nAt length the modified act was passed, limiting the total amount of\r\nUnited States notes to be issued to 400 millions, with such additional\r\namount, not exceeding 50 millions, as might be transiently required for\r\nthe redemption of the temporary loan, and thus the main features of the\r\nBank Act, which has served its purpose very well, became a law.\r\n\r\nI hope, however, ere long, as I have more fully intimated in another\r\nchapter, to see a superior system of banking, which I believe must\r\nsucceed the present system, which is now doomed to “innocuous desuetude”\r\nthrough the imminent payment of the public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n         THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR NINETY-FOUR YEARS.—FROM A BUTTON-WOOD\r\n    TREE TO A PALACE COSTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.—ENORMOUS GROWTH AND\r\n    DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS.—HOW THE PRESENT STOCK EXCHANGE WAS\r\n    FORMED BY THE CONSOLIDATION OF OTHER FINANCIAL BODIES.—PATRIOTIC\r\n    ACTION DURING THE WAR PERIOD.—REMINISCENCES OF MEN AND EVENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York Stock Exchange is not a building, as people generally\r\nsuppose. It is an Association of brokers united, but not incorporated by\r\nlaw, for the purpose of buying and selling representatives of value\r\ncalled “stocks” and “bonds.” Stocks, in the American sense of the term,\r\nare properties consisting of shares in joint stock companies or\r\ncorporations, or in the obligations of a government for its funded debt.\r\nIn England, government obligations only, are called “stocks,” and the\r\nobligations of companies or corporations are called “shares.”\r\n\r\nThe edifice in which the Stock Exchange meets, and which, in common\r\nparlance, is designated by the name of the association of members,\r\noccupies a large portion of the block bounded by Broad, Wall, and New\r\nstreets, and Exchange Place. Its main entrance is on Broad street, and\r\nit has entrances also on Wall and New streets. It has a frontage of 65\r\nfeet on Broad and 158 on New, on which the back entrance is situated.\r\nThe members of the Stock Exchange have no need of a charter from the\r\nLegislature. In fact, they have steadily resisted all attempts of the\r\nSolons of this State to legislate in their interest. Their notion in\r\nthis respect is more fully commented upon in my chapter on “Corners.”\r\nThe Tweed Ring, in the height of its power, made a bold attempt to force\r\na charter upon the Stock Exchange, but it was indignantly rejected. The\r\nirrepressible “Boss” and his henchmen, by the presentation of false\r\nnames, had a charter for the incorporation of the Stock Exchange passed\r\nin 1871, the year prior to Tweed’s downfall, and it was signed by the\r\nGovernor. For these gratuitous services the sum of $100,000 was\r\nimpudently demanded; but the charter was refused, and the demand\r\nrepudiated by the association. Since 1879 until recently the membership,\r\nwhich has been full, was limited to 1,100, but by a resolution lately\r\npassed the limit is now placed at 1,200. The seats for the past year\r\nhave sold at from $25,000 to $30,000.\r\n\r\nThe Stock Exchange building is a fine, solid structure, devoid of\r\nanything showy, pretentious or decorative. It was designed by James\r\nRenwick, the architect of Grace Church and of St. Patrick’s Roman\r\nCatholic Cathedral, on Fifth avenue at Fiftieth street. The cost of the\r\nbuilding was nearly $2,000,000. It costs nearly $200,000 a year to pay\r\nthe salaries of the various officials and keep the building in proper\r\nrepair. The apparatus for ventilating the building is one of the best.\r\nIt cost $30,000, and supplies an abundance of pure air and perfumes at\r\nthe same time. The heating and cooling arrangements are the best of\r\ntheir kind, and the lighting is admirable. There are three chandeliers\r\ncontaining 200 electric lamps, which throw a flood of beautiful soft\r\nlight around the whole interior. The building is well supplied with\r\nrooms for members, lavatories, and closets. One great feature of the\r\ninterior consists of the large vaults, which contain more than a\r\nthousand safes for the safe keeping of securities. About 400 of those\r\nsafes are let to persons who are not members. The vaults and safes are\r\nconsidered the strongest in the country.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this institution appears marvelous when we go back to its\r\nhumble beginning in 1792, when the originators formed the association\r\nunder a button-wood tree in front of what is now No. 60 Wall Street.\r\nFollowing is the text of the simple agreement into which the original\r\nmembers entered: “We, the subscribers, brokers for the purchase and sale\r\nof public stocks, do hereby solemnly promise and pledge ourselves to\r\neach other that we will not buy or sell from this date, for any person\r\nwhatsoever any kind of public stocks at a less rate than one-quarter of\r\none per cent. commission on the specie value, and that we will give a\r\npreference to each other in our negotiations. In testimony whereof, we\r\nhave set our hands this 17th day of May, at New York, 1792.

Lawrence, John Besley, Charles McIvers, Jr.,\r\nRobinson & Hartshorn, David Reedy.”\r\n\r\nThis arrangement existed, and was the only one by which the members were\r\nbound, until 1820, when daily meetings and the regular call of stocks\r\nbegan. The Board met in various places, including the old Merchants’\r\nExchange on the corner of Wall and William streets, but did not take\r\nroot in permanent shape until the year 1842, when it became established\r\nin the new Merchants’ Exchange, now the Custom House. An illustration of\r\nthe old Merchants’ Exchange is given on another page. The sight of it\r\nwill doubtless awake a host of endearing reminiscences in the minds of\r\nsome of the oldest merchants and speculators. It will be remembered by\r\nthe few survivors of that period that about the year 1820 the meetings\r\nof the Board were held in the office of Samuel J. Beebee, at 47 Wall\r\nStreet. The Board also met in a room in the rear of Leonard Bleecker’s;\r\nalso in the office of the old _Courier and Journal_. Subsequently the\r\nmeetings of the Board were held in an upper room of the old Merchants’\r\nExchange. This building was destroyed by the great fire of 1835, and\r\nafterwards the new Merchants’ Exchange was built. The Board moved into\r\nthis building in 1842, and remained there until 1853. Up to this time\r\nthe Board was the very closest of corporations, its membership being\r\ngoverned by the most iron-clad rules. There was no field for financial\r\nnews agencies in those days, for the Board kept its proceedings a\r\nprofound mystery, and its members were bound to the strictest secresy on\r\npain of expulsion. That wonderful development of our later civilization,\r\nthe ubiquitous interviewer, was then unknown. The business of the Board\r\nexcited the most intense curiosity, and so impatient did outsiders\r\nbecome to learn the mysteries of the interior, that the members of an\r\nopen Board which was organized about the year 1837, after failing to\r\nforce themselves into the regular association, engaged a building next\r\nto the Board-room, and dug the bricks out of the wall in order that they\r\nmight see and hear what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe Board removed from the Merchants’ Exchange building in 1863 to a\r\nroom in the Commercial Exchange Bank building, at the corner of Beaver\r\nand William. About the year 1857, memorable as the period of the great\r\npanic, and my advent in Wall Street, the Board removed to “Dan Lord’s\r\nbuilding,” which had entrances on William and Beaver streets. It was\r\nhere, about the time of my advent, in Wall street, more fully described\r\nin another chapter, that some of the great speculators of that era\r\nfigured. Among these were Daniel Drew, Jacob Little, and the lightning\r\ncalculator, Morse, who made and lost a fortune of millions in little\r\nmore than a year. In this building the rule of secresy was not relaxed,\r\nand the fact is on record that a hundred dollars a day were freely\r\noffered for the privilege of listening at the key-hole during the time\r\nof the calls. The Board continued to hold its meetings in this building\r\nduring the war, and up to 1865, when it removed to the present edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BOARD ROOM OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note here that the Stock Exchange, during the war, for\r\nthe purpose of assisting the Government, passed a resolution prohibiting\r\nmembers from selling Government bonds “short;” and also a resolution\r\nforbidding all dealings in gold. The latter resolution was the principal\r\ncause of the formation of the Gold Exchange. This action on the part of\r\nthe Stock Exchange was taken at a pecuniary loss of many millions of\r\ndollars, the sacrifice having been made for the highest and noblest of\r\npatriotic purposes; yet, in the face of such an historic record as this\r\nsome people still imagine that the members of the Stock Exchange never\r\nhave been anything but a selfish set of money grabbers. Is there any\r\nother institution in the country whose members would have made such a\r\npersonal sacrifice in the interest of the Government? I doubt if there\r\nis. Certainly, none did.\r\n\r\nThere was a second Open Board of Brokers formed in the year 1863. It\r\ntook up its quarters first in a basement in William street, called the\r\n“Coal Hole.” The membership began to increase rapidly, and the business\r\naccumulated so fast that the Board was soon enabled to take more\r\ncapacious accommodations on Broad street, contiguous to the Stock\r\nExchange. In this menacing attitude the new Board began to make serious\r\ninroads on the business of the old one, almost one-half of which it had\r\nacquired by the year 1869, when the old Board called a truce. It was\r\nseen by the judicious members of the Board that the competition was\r\nlikely to work the ruin of both, and amicable negotiations were begun\r\nwhich culminated in consolidation. So the Open Board, the Stock Exchange\r\nand the United States Government Board were consolidated in May, 1869,\r\nmaking the strongest public financial association in the country, and\r\none of the most important in the world, and placing it upon an almost\r\nimpregnable footing. Mr. William Neilson was the first President in the\r\nnew building.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of the Presidents of the New York Stock\r\nExchange from 1824 until the present time:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1824  EDW.

T. STEWART MADE “CORNERS.”—ALL IMPORTING FIRMS DEAL\r\n    IN “FUTURES.”—LEGISLATION AGAINST “CORNERS” WOULD STOP ENTERPRISE\r\n    AND CAUSE STAGNATION IN BUSINESS.—ONLY THE CONSPIRATORS THEMSELVES\r\n    GET HURT IN “CORNERS.”—THE BLACK FRIDAY “CORNER.”—SPECULATION IN\r\n    GRAIN BENEFICIAL TO CONSUMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York Stock Exchange is organized after the same manner as a\r\nsocial club, such as the Union League, the Union or the Manhattan, and\r\nnot under a special charter from the Legislature. Hence it is protected\r\nfrom the interference of that honorable body.\r\n\r\nAlthough various attempts have been made, from time to time, at Albany,\r\nto levy taxes upon the transactions of the Exchange, and to interfere\r\nwith the business of speculation and investment in many other ways,\r\nthese legislative designs have hitherto been happily frustrated.\r\n\r\nShortly after the memorable “corner” in Hannibal & St. Jo., in 1881,\r\nanother attempt was made by the Legislature to force Wall Street matters\r\nunder the jurisdiction of Albany lobbyists and “scalpers.”\r\n\r\nThe newspaper articles on the subject of the “corner” had attracted the\r\nattention of the Legislature then in session, and naturally suggested to\r\nsome of the wiseacres of that dignified and incorruptible body that the\r\n“corner” afforded an excellent opportunity, when the public mind was\r\nexcited on the subject, to raise an outcry against the shocking\r\nimmorality of such huge speculations.\r\n\r\nA Senate Committee on “corners” and “futures” was therefore appointed,\r\nand various Wall Street men were summoned to appear before it, and give\r\ntheir testimony on this interesting subject. I had the honor of being\r\none of the witnesses cited. I promptly obeyed the subpœna in preference\r\nto taking the risk of being hauled up for contempt and sent to durance\r\nvile. I appeared before the Committee at the Metropolitan Hotel, and not\r\nonly answered all questions put to me, without any fashionable lapses of\r\nmemory, after the manner of certain other financiers, but I regaled the\r\nCommittee with a little dissertation on the subject of investigation. I\r\nhad letters from members of the Legislature afterwards complimenting me\r\nfor having made the points very clear. So I can say, “Praise from Sir\r\nHubert is praise indeed,” and therefore I am encouraged to reproduce\r\nthat effort in this volume, not so much from an intense desire to go\r\ndown to posterity as a successful orator, as from a disposition to\r\nrecord my approval, in more permanent form, of the soundness of the\r\nlegislative judgment on my explanation of “corners.”\r\n\r\nWhen the applause had subsided, I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen of the Committee on Corners and Futures: Speculation is a\r\nmethod now adopted for adjusting differences of opinion as to future\r\nvalues, whether of products or securities. This is more common now than\r\nin former years because the facilities for procuring information have\r\nincreased with the greater intelligence and celerity with which all\r\nbusiness is now conducted, and also from the greater rapidity with which\r\nsuch information can be transmitted by telegraph and cable.\r\n\r\n“In former years the results of a crop were known only when it came to\r\nthe market. Now almost everything affecting its future value is known\r\nwith a fair degree of accuracy before the crop is harvested. This\r\nadvanced information naturally becomes the subject of speculative\r\ntransactions which could not have existed in former times.\r\n\r\n“Speculation brings into play the best intelligence as to the future of\r\nvalues. It has always two sides. The one that is based principally on\r\nthe facts and conditions of the situation wins in the end, and the\r\nresult of the conflict is the nearest possible approach to correct\r\nvalues. The consequences of speculation are thus financially beneficial\r\nto the country at large.\r\n\r\n“Speculation for a fall in prices is based upon the presumption of an\r\nover-supply. If it succeeds, the production of the particular product is\r\nchecked until prices recover, and in the meantime production is diverted\r\nto articles less abundant. Thus speculation proves a regulator both of\r\nvalues and production. Speculation for a rise in prices is based upon a\r\npresumption of scarcity or short supply, and its direct effect is to\r\nquicken production and restore the equilibrium of prices.\r\n\r\n“‘Corners’ usually come from running speculation to an excessive length,\r\nby which the seller becomes responsible for deliveries beyond what he\r\ncan possibly make. He thereby places himself at the mercy of those with\r\nwhom he has made the contracts. These exigencies chiefly affect the\r\nspeculators themselves, and the community at large but little.\r\n\r\n“Extreme prices usually grow out of them, but they are only momentary,\r\nand have small effect upon regular or cash transactions, which\r\nsympathize very remotely with these temporary and artificial quotations.\r\n\r\n“Speculation is not to be judged by its occasional excesses, but by the\r\ngeneral effects which the foregoing considerations show to be\r\nbeneficial. It regulates production by instantaneously advancing prices\r\nwhen there is a scarcity, thereby stimulating production, and by\r\ndepressing prices when there is over-production. It thus becomes one of\r\nthe most beneficial agents in the business world for the prevention of\r\npanics.\r\n\r\n“Speculation, moreover, makes a market for securities that otherwise\r\nwould not exist. It enables railroads to be built through the ready sale\r\nof their bonds, thus adding materially to the wealth of the whole\r\ncountry, and opening a more profitable market to labor. In this it\r\nbecomes the forerunner of enterprise and material prosperity in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“There are ‘corners’ in all kinds of business as well as in Wall Street\r\nspeculation. Mr. A. T. Stewart, the great dry goods merchant, made more\r\n‘corners’ during the latter part of his life than half the rest of the\r\nbusiness community put together. He did this mainly by contracting for\r\nthe entire and exclusive production of certain classes of goods, and as\r\nsuch goods could only be bought at his establishment he had a close\r\n‘corner’ in them, and accordingly put on his own prices.\r\n\r\n“The greater portion of all the large mercantile firms do business in\r\nthe same way. And all the importing firms deal in futures. They sell\r\ngoods by sample, agreeing to deliver them at a future stated period,\r\nvarying from thirty days to twelve months. In the meantime the goods\r\nhave to be manufactured, and in many instances purchasers have to wait\r\nuntil they are grown, and imported thousands of miles.\r\n\r\n“If it were not for the support which comes from the ‘short’ interest in\r\ngrain and the general activity created thereby in times of depression,\r\nwhich come periodically in this country, it would be in the power of the\r\nlarge speculative grain dealers in Europe to manipulate prices downward,\r\nand purchase our products every year, on raids, at prices much under the\r\ncost of production.\r\n\r\n“When we sell to Europe we must do so at a profit, or our transactions\r\ndon’t help to enrich the country.\r\n\r\n“Another curious thing about ‘corners’ is that the people who organize\r\nand manipulate them generally get most hurt in the enterprise. This was\r\nthe case with the ‘corner’ referred to in Hannibal and St. Joseph. Mr.\r\nJohn Duff, of Boston, was the man in whose prolific brain that ‘corner’\r\noriginated, and the result to him was financial ruin. The stock ran up\r\nto 350, though the short account amounted to only about 1,200 shares,\r\nand the ‘shorts’ had to settle at 280.\r\n\r\n“The result was similar in the ‘corner’ in Northwest in 1872,\r\nmanipulated by Jay Gould. The stock was started at 80 and it ran up to\r\n280. It then reacted to the former figure. I believe Jay Gould was alone\r\nin that deal, and it came pretty near crushing him, in spite of his\r\nincomparable capacity for wriggling out of a tight place.\r\n\r\n“Patents are ‘corners’ protected by law. The inventor has a monopoly for\r\nseventeen years in his invention against all the world, and this gives\r\nhim a right to make and sell the article covered by his patent, often at\r\na profit of several hundred per cent. on the original cost, and on the\r\nprice it would bring if placed in competition in the open market, like\r\nrailroad stocks and grain.\r\n\r\n“If it is the intention of the Legislature of this State to stop\r\nenterprise in business, then your Committee is undertaking to accomplish\r\nthat work in the right way, but I think your success would be a public\r\ncalamity.”\r\n\r\nI doubt the expediency of either undertaking to regulate enterprise by\r\nlaw or to choke off competition by the law-making power. The result\r\nwould be woeful stagnation in business. It would crush the motives for\r\ncommercial activity and depress the creative energies of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe law of supply and demand is the best regulator.\r\n\r\nCongress attempted to suppress speculation in gold during the war, and\r\nas soon as the act was passed prohibiting such dealings, the premium on\r\ngold advanced 100 per cent. This so much terrified the wise statesmen\r\nwho concocted this sweeping measure of financial reform, that they\r\nimmediately displayed much more wisdom in hastening to have the bill\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nThe simple reason that such laws will not work in practice is that where\r\nthere is a will there is generally a way to evade them. This is the case\r\nwith the very best of such laws that can possibly be framed. Take the\r\nusury laws for example. The methods of getting around these are\r\nnumerous, and there is practically no limit to the rate of interest that\r\ncan be exacted except the conscience of the lender, which is frequently\r\nvery elastic. Daniel O’Connell said he could drive a coach and six\r\nthrough any act of Parliament. Jake Sharp was also of opinion that he\r\ncould run a double-track horse-car railroad through the best act that\r\ncould be framed by any Albany Legislature. Jake was checked in his\r\ncareer at considerable trouble and expense, but his case illustrated\r\nthat the rule referred to holds good generally in legislation.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, that it seldom happens that anybody gets badly hurt\r\nin “corners,” except the conspirators themselves, is sufficient\r\nprotection for the general public, and should set the minds of\r\nlegislators at rest, if they mean to do legitimate business in their\r\nlaw-making capacity.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators in “corners” are usually left high and dry without any\r\nmarket for their fictitious values, and the “corner” very frequently has\r\nthe effect of putting the property out of the speculative market for a\r\nlong time. The fate of Han. & St. Jo. is a warning to those who\r\nmanipulate “corners.” The stock was seldom quoted for months afterwards.\r\n\r\nTake the case of Black Friday for example. It was most disastrous to the\r\nparties intimately connected with it. It came near proving Gould’s ruin,\r\nand he has not got over the moral effect of it yet. The probability is\r\nit will be an heirloom in his family, a skeleton in the Gould closet for\r\ngenerations to come. Gould and Black Friday have become synonymous in\r\nthe minds of many people, and the further from Wall Street the more the\r\ndistinction becomes confounded.\r\n\r\nIn making these remarks I have no intention of throwing any reflection\r\nupon Mr. George Gould, who seems to be a very promising young man for a\r\nrich man’s son. His careful education has, no doubt, done much to\r\ncounteract the drawbacks incident to the sons of wealthy men to which I\r\nhave referred more fully in another part of this book. His maternal\r\ntraining, I understand, has been of the most exemplary kind. This will\r\ngo far to offset the disadvantages to a business career, which the\r\naccident of his birth in luxurious surroundings, according to my theory,\r\notherwise entails. If his brain is composed of the genuine plastic\r\nmaterial out of which the craniums of successful financiers are made, he\r\nmay learn to forget that he has been nursed in the lap of luxury, and\r\nlook back with due respect to the hole whence his father was digged and\r\nthe rock whence he was hewn. He may have brains enough, possibly, to\r\nreflect with more pride on that ingenious mousetrap that first brought\r\nhis father into prominence, than the gew-gaws of the gilded palace in\r\nFifth avenue, the luxuries of the handsome parlors and rich\r\nconservatories at Irvington, and the gorgeous trappings of his father’s\r\nyacht and palace cars. I have, therefore, great hopes that George will\r\nbe a conspicuous exception to the rule I have propounded elsewhere\r\nregarding rich men’s sons.\r\n\r\nWhen a large mercantile firm buys up goods in any line so that nobody\r\nelse has the same goods, it then has a “corner” in these goods.\r\n\r\n“Corners” in goods differ from “corners” in Wall Street in regard to\r\ntheir influence on the organizers. They don’t act like a boomerang as\r\nthe Wall Street “corners” mostly do. The “corner” is sometimes sustained\r\nduring the life of the manipulator, as in the case of Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\nThe successors of the great operators sometimes maintain it, but in this\r\ninstance Judge Hilton made a signal failure, though in some respects he\r\nis a far abler man than Stewart was. Yet, he had not the genius, for\r\nworking “corners,” of his eminent predecessor. He is, probably, so well\r\nlearned in the law that he has too much inclination to go around the\r\n“corners.”\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, very few of these merchants can become wealthy\r\nexcept through the medium of “corners.” It is by these peculiar methods\r\nthat nearly all large fortunes are amassed in their line, and in a\r\nperfectly legitimate manner, too, whatever casuists and hair-splitting\r\nmoralists may say or think about the matter. The tendency to make\r\n“corners” seems to be interwoven in our business methods, and to play an\r\nimportant part in the struggle for existence. So I don’t see what we are\r\ngoing to do about it without a radical change in that compendium of the\r\nbest political wisdom that the world has ever seen. I refer to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. All the acumen and sophistry which\r\nthe most astute Philadelphia lawyer could bring to bear upon it has\r\nhitherto failed to show that there is anything in this wonderful\r\ndocument opposed to the liberty of making “corners.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gladstone has truly said: “This document is the most wonderful\r\nwork ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.”\r\n\r\nI hold there is nothing in the Constitution opposed to the freedom of\r\nmaking “corners,” and that all the evils resulting from these\r\nspeculative inventions can be met and counteracted by business methods,\r\nand the laws regulating the ordinary concerns of life without resorting\r\nto any rigid or special methods.\r\n\r\nTo dispose of “corners” or abolish them on the large scale to which I\r\nhave alluded would presume an entire revolution in our social system,\r\nand to attack them piecemeal, as the Legislature frequently does,\r\ninvolves a very suspicious kind of discrimination, and is at variance\r\nwith the spirit of the Constitution. In fact it often amounts to a kind\r\nof thinly-disguised blackmail.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that it is almost impossible to legislate against\r\n“corners” without aiming a fatal blow at speculation itself, which, as I\r\nhave shown, is a vital principle in the regulation of values, the\r\nstability of business, and the prevention of panics.\r\n\r\nI believe the men of most experience, not only in Wall Street, but in\r\nother departments of finance and commerce, will bear me out in the\r\nstatement that a market where even values are considerably inflated by\r\nspeculation, is more desirable than a period of depression. The result,\r\nin the long run, is the greatest good to the greatest number. I don’t\r\nbelieve that the ghost of Jeremy Bentham himself could rise up and\r\nconsistently condemn this statement.\r\n\r\nI believe that speculation in grain and provisions is materially\r\nbeneficial to consumers, and that the latter are better off, one year\r\nwith another, and less liable to be menaced with periodical famines,\r\nthan if there were no speculation in these necessities of life.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this prolific theme of “corners” I wish to say a few\r\nwords about my own experience in that line. The only “corner” in which I\r\nhave ever been materially hurt during my long business experience was\r\none manipulated by the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis Sovereign State issued and granted altogether about eight millions\r\nof bonds, all bearing the great seal, properly signed and legally issued\r\nfor full value. I advanced over two million dollars in good money on a\r\npart of these bonds. Shortly after this transaction, the State of\r\nGeorgia ascertained through a garbled report of a committee sent to this\r\ncity by the Georgia Legislature, that all these bonds were held outside\r\nof her own borders. The Legislature then passed an act of repudiation,\r\nthereby reducing the value of the bonds from par to that of waste paper.\r\nWhen I discovered that my little pile of two million dollars in what I\r\nconsidered good securities would no longer exchange for greenbacks, I\r\nhad a very disagreeable sensation of having been “cornered” by the high\r\ntoned and chivalrous representatives of the State of Georgia, which,\r\nthrough its lawmakers, claimed the sovereign right to do wrong to the\r\ncitizens of a sister State.\r\n\r\nIn the Harlem “corner,” which is referred to in another place, contracts\r\nto deliver at 110 were settled at 179.\r\n\r\nAbout three million dollars were taken out of the pockets of the bears.\r\nSeveral prominent houses went down in the struggle. The result of the\r\n“corner” was that the bulls were saddled with the entire capital stock\r\nof the property.\r\n\r\nOne broker, who had sold calls at 150 and was requested to fulfil his\r\ncontracts when the stock had advanced to 250, was very much in the same\r\nposition as Glendower’s spirits, which were called from the vasty deep\r\nbut would not come. “I don’t see anything here,” he said, “about\r\ndelivering. You can call, but I don’t mind it.”\r\n\r\nThere were two “corners” in Harlem. The Common Council was cornered in\r\none and the Legislature in the other.\r\n\r\nIn the Rock Island “corner” the bulls bought 20,000 shares more than\r\nexisted, and the price rose from 110 to 150.\r\n\r\nLondon financiers have a fearful horror of “corners.” Hence the London\r\nStock Exchange is very chary about listing our railroads, especially\r\nthose with a moderate number of shares.\r\n\r\n“Corners” are seldom profitable, and the parties connected with them can\r\nhardly escape getting badly hurt unless they are prepared to own and\r\ncarry the entire property. Even in that event, it is usually put out of\r\nthe speculative market for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson “corner” was one of the most successful. It paid a profit of\r\n12 per cent. There was a profit of 4½ on the Rock Island “corner.”\r\n\r\nThe first “corner” of which there is any record in Wall Street was in\r\nMorris Canal, an old “fancy” now almost forgotten except for its\r\n“corner.” It had been forced upward as fancies frequently are, until it\r\nwas far above its intrinsic value, and several operators began to sell\r\n“short.”\r\n\r\nAfter this operation had gone on for some time a pool was formed to\r\nprotect it, and the pool bought it all up and locked it up in a trunk.\r\nThe operation was new to the Street and the bears were astounded, but\r\nwhen called upon to settle they became furious, and accused the\r\nmanipulators of the “corner” of entering into a conspiracy. The “bulls”\r\nasked the “bears” why they had sold what they did not possess and could\r\nnot procure.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was referred to the arbitration of the Board of Brokers, and\r\nthat eminent body, then unsophisticated in the arts of speculation, took\r\nwhat seemed to them an equitable view of the case, and decided it in\r\nfavor of the “shorts,” who, on the ground of conspiracy on the part of\r\nthe clique, were relieved from fulfilling their obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n          THE COMMODORE’S “CORNERS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT HUDSON “CORNER.”—COMMODORE VANDERBILT THE “BOSS” OF THE\r\n    SITUATION.—THE “CORNER” FORCED UPON HIM.—HOW HE MANAGED THE TRICK OF\r\n    GETTING THE BEARS TO “TURN” THE STOCK, AND THEN CAUGHT THEM.—HIS\r\n    ABLE DEVICE OF UNLOADING WHILE FORCING THE BEARS TO COVER AT HIGH\r\n    FIGURES.—THE HARLEM “CORNER.”—THE COMMON COUNCIL BETRAYED THE\r\n    COMMODORE, BUT WERE CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN TRAP, AND LOST MILLIONS.—THE\r\n    LEGISLATURE ATTEMPT THE SAME GAME, AND MEET WITH A SIMILAR FATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Hudson “corner,” the stock jumped from 112 to 180. Commodore\r\nVanderbilt was the “Boss” of the situation in this “corner.” He got the\r\n“bulge” completely on all the other parties connected with it, and what\r\nis more, he had the balance of the sympathy of the Street with him, for\r\nhe was not the aggressor in getting up the “corner.” The fighting at\r\nfirst was forced upon him, but he acted on the defensive in a way that\r\nmade his opponents sorry for their rashness. Though he did not know much\r\nabout Shakespeare, he acted in accordance with old Polonius’ advice to\r\nhis son by pushing the opposition to the wall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he gained the mastery, he became severely aggressive, as he\r\nwas in everything.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this story of the Hudson “corner” is somewhat romantic.\r\nThe Commodore was sunning himself on a pile of logs on the Jersey side\r\nof the Hudson while his yacht lay in the stream, and he was in the mood\r\nfor enjoying a long and well-earned vacation, attempting to lay aside\r\nfor a time the toil and trouble of eking out a precarious existence in\r\nspeculation. While basking in the noon-day sun and gazing with delight\r\non the luxurious foliage that arose from the New Jersey bank of the\r\nriver, he was aroused from his charming reverie by a messenger from Wall\r\nStreet, who conveyed to him the important intelligence that a wicked and\r\nunregenerate clique of “bears” had conspired to sell Hudson stock\r\n“short,” and that it was declining with great rapidity under the\r\nrepeated and unmerciful blows of their hammers.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore arose and shook off his lethargy, as a lion may be\r\nsupposed to shake the dew from his mane prior to his preparation for a\r\nspring upon an unfortunate foe.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore hastened down to Wall Street and instructed his brokers to\r\ntake all the sellers’ options offered in Hudson. Cash stock was then\r\ntaken as quickly as possible until the market was bare. A brief\r\ncalculation showed that the buyers had secured either as cash or\r\ncontract stock all the Hudson stock in existence with the exception of a\r\nsmall number of shares which were not expected to come upon the market.\r\n\r\nThe prolific brain of the Commodore then invented a new move in the\r\ngame. A number of leading “bear” houses were requested to “turn” Hudson,\r\nwhich means to buy it for cash from the cornering party and sell it back\r\nto them on buyers’ options for periods varying from ten to thirty days.\r\nThis able ruse was intended to impress the bears with the idea that the\r\ncornering party was weak. It seemed as if they were short of cash. So\r\nthe leading bears grasped at the good chance, as they imagined, of\r\nturning several thousand shares, and instantly threw the cash stock on\r\nthe market. It was privately picked up by the brokers of the great\r\n“cornerer.”\r\n\r\nEverything having thus far progressed in favor of the ruse the trap was\r\nsprung upon the unsuspecting party. The sellers’ options began to\r\nmature, and there was no Hudson to be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe “corner” was complete, and the stock rose to 180. It had been 112 a\r\nfew mornings before, when the Commodore was basking in the sun, and\r\nfound that the bears were taking advantage of his absence. The loss on a\r\nhundred shares was $6,800.\r\n\r\nThere were about 50,000 shares contracted for to be delivered at this\r\nrate of profit by the “cornerers.” It will thus be seen that they were\r\nwell fixed.\r\n\r\nThe bears were in terrible anguish.\r\n\r\nBut the worst part of the deal for these poor animals had yet to come.\r\nThe bears who had turned the stock were notified that they must stand\r\nand deliver. They complained bitterly of the ingratitude of the bulls,\r\nwhom they had only sought to oblige, by turning the stock. The bulls\r\nwere implacable, however, and demanded their property. They proposed a\r\ncompromise which was most exacting. They were willing to lend stock at\r\nfive per cent. per day. Some of the bears paid this, thinking the\r\n“corner” would be of short duration, but it continued for over two\r\nweeks, and, after paying five per cent. a day for several days, these\r\npoor victims bought the stock at the high rate and settled.\r\n\r\nThis double move in turning the stock was the ablest trick that had ever\r\nbeen accomplished in cornering. It made Vanderbilt king of strategists\r\nin that line.\r\n\r\nBut the best part of the stratagem was that wherein the bulls saved\r\nthemselves from being saddled with the whole stock, and made immense\r\nprofits out of the deal.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the bears were purchasing to cover at 170, Vanderbilt’s\r\nprivate brokers were selling at 140, the clique thus craftily unloading\r\nat good paying figures. This was one of the best inside moves in the\r\nwhole history of “corners.”\r\n\r\nThe bulls thus saved themselves from the risk of being loaded with\r\nprobably the whole, or at any rate the greater part of the capital\r\nstock, and through the Commodore’s able management the load was\r\ncomparatively light at the end of the deal, the property remaining as\r\ngood a speculative as before, which is a rare exception in “corners.”\r\n\r\nThe “corner” in Harlem was not less skilfully managed than the one in\r\nHudson, but it had fewer complications. It was all plain sailing, so to\r\nspeak, compared with the former, yet it clearly illustrated that the\r\nCommodore had a genius for “corners.” When he managed the Harlem\r\n“corner” he had had no experience in railroad matters, and he had\r\nreached the ripe age of sixty-nine.\r\n\r\nI place the Hudson “corner” first in order because it was, in several\r\nrespects, the greatest, though it happened at a later date than the\r\nHarlem.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that in nearly all “corners” with which the\r\nCommodore was connected, he was on the defensive, and seldom the\r\naggressor at the beginning of the fight. He was always placed in such a\r\nposition that he had to fight hard to defend his property, or let it go\r\nto the dogs.\r\n\r\nBuying stock in Harlem was his first venture in railroad transactions.\r\nHe bought it as an investment. This was in 1863. Thirty years prior to\r\nthis he had been requested to go into Harlem, but he declined,\r\nironically remarking: “I’m a steamboat man, a competitor of these steam\r\ncontrivances that you tell us will run on dry land. Go ahead. I wish you\r\nwell, but I never shall have anything to do with ’em.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Commodore went into Harlem it was selling at eight or nine\r\ndollars a share. It had been down as low as three dollars about the time\r\nI arrived in Wall Street. He put some money in the road, began\r\nimprovements and the stock soon rose to 30. Many people predicted that\r\nthe Commodore would lose all the money in railroads that he had made in\r\nsteamboats.\r\n\r\nThe stock, however, gradually rose to 50, and speculators began to\r\nperceive that there was some inside movement going on. This was made\r\napparent when, one day in April, 1863, the Common Council of this city\r\npassed an ordinance authorizing the Commodore to build a street railroad\r\ndown Broadway to the Battery. So Jake Sharp’s enterprise was not\r\noriginal, as the Commodore was over twenty years ahead of him.\r\n\r\nThe Common Council were not immaculate in those days either, though the\r\nJaehnes and Waites escaped punishment. They basely deceived the\r\nCommodore after taking his money; but he punished them severely. As soon\r\nas the franchise was granted, Harlem advanced to 75, and the Aldermen\r\nbegan to sell it “short.” They thought they had the Commodore fast in\r\ntheir clutches, and took their friends into the secret. They expected to\r\nsell enough of stock to make several millions. Their plan was to sell\r\n“short” all that the market would take, and then repeal the ordinance,\r\nwhich would cause the stock to drop probably below 50. Drew was one of\r\nthe great bears in this deal with the Aldermen.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore got wind of the scheme, went on buying, and got others to\r\nhelp him, taking all the “shorts” that were offered. The operators had\r\nsoon sold a great deal more Harlem stock than there was actually in\r\nexistence. There were 110,000 shares of Harlem. When the Aldermen and\r\ntheir friends thought they had made millions, they repealed the\r\nordinance, and Judge Brady, in the Court of Common Pleas, at the same\r\ntime issued an injunction prohibiting the laying of rails on the\r\nBroadway road.\r\n\r\nEverybody thought that the Commodore was hopelessly ruined. Harlem\r\nstock, however, dropped three points only, to 72. This created surprise\r\namong the Aldermen and the bears. They thought it should have dropped to\r\n50. The “shorts” went into the market for the purpose of covering.\r\nHarlem ascended with amazing rapidity to 100, to 150, to 170 and finally\r\nto 179. The Common Council were obliged to make their final settlements\r\nat the last figure. The Commodore had all the stock. The Common Council\r\nlost a million, and their friends, whom they had advised to sell\r\n“short,” lost several millions. The Commodore “raked in” five or six\r\nmillions, and went on his way rejoicing and improving Harlem, having now\r\ntaken “Bill” in with him as vice president.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally imagine that the severe lesson which the Common\r\nCouncil had received in “corners” would have taught others to beware of\r\nthe Commodore in this line of speculation, although it was new to him,\r\nbut it did not. People as a rule will not learn either by precept or\r\nexample. They must go through the rough experience themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature soon fell into the same trap in which the Common Council\r\nhad been caught and which they had actually set for themselves. The\r\nfollowing year the Commodore secured control of the Hudson River\r\nRailroad through the purchase of its stock, and afterwards secured a\r\nsufficient number of the members of the Legislature to pass a bill\r\nconsolidating the road with Harlem. He also won the promise of the\r\nGovernor to sign the bill.\r\n\r\nHarlem again began to rise, and went from 75 to 150. This was early in\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislature employed to pass the bill pocketed the\r\nmoney of the Commodore and then hatched a conspiracy, after the manner\r\nof the Common Council, to ruin him and make millions by his fall. He had\r\na shrewd lobbyist in the Legislature, however, who attentively watched\r\nhis interests while he came down to New York to purchase stock for the\r\nrise that must have necessarily followed the passage of the bill. He had\r\nnot been long in Wall Street when he was informed that the Legislature\r\nwere imitating the game in which the Common Council had been so signally\r\ndefeated the previous year. The Commodore sent him word to keep close\r\nwatch at Albany, and he went on buying stock in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThe bill was defeated. Harlem stock had a slump from 150 to 90. The\r\nCommodore was in a dilemma, and would have been dreadfully embarrassed\r\nonly for the intense avarice of the Legislature. If they had bought and\r\ndelivered at 90, they would have made millions, which the Commodore\r\nwould have lost; but, like the horse leech’s daughter, they cried out\r\nfor more. Nothing would satisfy them until the stock should be depressed\r\nto 50. Then they could “scoop” in several millions and the Commodore\r\nwould be wound up. This was probably the darkest hour in the Commodore’s\r\nlife. He hardly knew which way to turn. He was on the ragged edge. He\r\nhas often pathetically described his feelings at this crisis to his\r\nintimate friends. He was almost on the brink of despair. He sent for old\r\nJohn Tobin, who had been a gate keeper at the ferry-house at Staten\r\nIsland. Tobin had made quite a haul in the former deal in Harlem, and\r\nwas worth over a million. He told Tobin what the perfidious members of\r\nthe Legislature had done. John had been buying Harlem also in prospect\r\nof a rise.\r\n\r\n“They stuck you too, John,” said the Commodore. “How do you feel about\r\nit?” John sighed, and replied that his feelings were not the most\r\nenviable. “Shall we let ’em bleed us?” queried the Commodore.\r\n\r\nJohn sighed again, but did not know what reply to make.\r\n\r\n“John, don’t them fellows need dressing down?” emphatically queried the\r\nCommodore. John answered in the affirmative, but did not see how it was\r\nto be accomplished, as “them fellows” at that moment seemed to hold the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause of deep reflection, the Commodore, again addressing John\r\nwith intensified emphasis in his tone, said: “John, let us teach ’em\r\nnever to go back on their word again as long as they draw breath. Let us\r\ntry the Harlem ‘corner’ once more.”\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to try and repeat the Harlem “corner.”\r\n\r\nJohn put up a million. Leonard Jerome also went into the deal. It took\r\nfive millions to face the Legislature in this game, in which they had\r\nevery opportunity of packing all the cards. It was virtually, at first,\r\na silent game of whist, at which the Commodore was a noted player. He\r\nnever played with greater skill than this time, except in the Hudson\r\n“corner,” and in both instances he almost manifested the skill of\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislature completely lost their heads. The old\r\nclassic maxim, “whom the gods devote to destruction, they first make\r\nmad,” appeared to apply peculiarly to them, in the manipulation of the\r\nHarlem “corner.” Some of them mortgaged their houses and lands to get\r\nmoney to sell Harlem “short.” They advised all their friends that it was\r\nsuch a sure thing that failure was impossible, and brought all of their\r\nacquaintances whom they could influence into the speculative maelstrom\r\nof Harlem.\r\n\r\nIn the coarse of a few weeks, the members of the Legislature and their\r\nfriends had sold millions of Harlem to be delivered at various periods\r\nduring the summer, when they expected it would go ‘way down, probably to\r\n8 or 9, where the Commodore had originally bought it.\r\n\r\nThey expected, moreover, that the Commodore would have appeared at\r\nAlbany either in person or by his lobby representatives to sue for terms\r\nof settlement. They were greatly disappointed. He never left the company\r\nof his brokers in Wall Street, and persisted in purchasing. The members\r\nthought he must be mad, or at least in his dotage. He was then\r\nthreescore and ten, the Scriptural limit of human days.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore continued to purchase Harlem until he had\r\nbought—paradoxical as it may seem to the general reader—27,000 shares\r\nmore than were in existence of Harlem stock.\r\n\r\nWhen the members of the Legislature who set the trap to catch\r\nVanderbilt, but in which they themselves were now hopelessly ensnared,\r\nwent into the market to buy for the purpose of covering, there was no\r\nHarlem to be had. Vanderbilt and his brokers had every share of it\r\nsafely secured in their strong boxes.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislature were paralyzed. They could expect no\r\nmercy from the Commodore. He owed them none, and though a good Christian\r\nprior to his death, he was then practically a stranger to the doctrine\r\nof the great Nazarene. “Return good for evil,” or, “whosoever shall\r\nsmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” He was\r\nrather inclined to follow the maxim of that practical Quaker, who, when\r\nsmitten on the cheek and asked to turn the other, replied, “Friend, thou\r\ndidst not read far enough. It is written, ‘pay what thou owest,’” and he\r\nknocked the fellow down.\r\n\r\nThis was the rule of action to which the Commodore rigidly adhered in\r\ndealing with the Legislature in the Harlem “corner.”\r\n\r\nWhen a compromise was mooted to him, the Commodore replied, “Put it up\r\nto a thousand. This panel game is bring tried too often.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt he would have put it up to a thousand and totally ruined the\r\nmembers of the Legislature, with the Governor and their friends\r\nincluded, only for the overpowering appeals of his two trustworthy\r\nfriends, Leonard Jerome and John Tobin.\r\n\r\nMr. Jerome had no sympathy for the Legislature, any more than Vanderbilt\r\nhad, but he had a patriotic desire to take care of the “Street,” thus\r\nshowing the large and comprehensive view of which this able financier is\r\ncapable where a broad speculative question and a variety of diverse\r\ninterests are involved.\r\n\r\n“If you should carry out your threat,” said Mr. Jerome to the Commodore,\r\n“it would break every house on the Street.”\r\n\r\nThe Commodore yielded to that touch of nature that makes all the world\r\nakin, and under the magnetism of Jerome’s prudent entreaty, like Pharaoh\r\nwith the Israelites, agreed to let the Legislature go—at 285 for Harlem.\r\n\r\nIn one day 15,000 shares matured at this figure. Speculators who read\r\nthese lines, just pause and think of it for a moment! The stock that\r\nsold at $3 when I made my debut in Wall Street in 1857, reached 285 in\r\n1864, and could have been put to 1,000. Don’t you feel astounded at the\r\npossibilities of speculation?\r\n\r\nThen, again, think of the one-man power that could accomplish this\r\nwonderful feat and prevail against a whole Legislature and its Governor,\r\nwith the choicest assortment of “crooked” lawyers in the State, versed\r\nin all the arts of duplicity and cunning to aid and abet said\r\nLegislature and its Governor.\r\n\r\nThink of this, and then you will have some conception of the astute mind\r\nthat the Commodore possessed, without education to assist it, in the\r\ncontest against this remarkable combination of well-trained mental\r\nforces. There can hardly be a doubt that the Commodore was a genius,\r\nprobably without equal in the financial world. There was hardly any\r\nachievement of his life which he gloated over with such ineffable\r\ndelight as the cornering of the Legislature. He would say, when\r\nreferring to the matter afterwards: “We busted the whole Legislature,\r\nand scores of the honorable members had to go home without paying their\r\nboard bills.” Thus ended the second “corner” in Harlem.\r\n\r\nMany large houses were ruined by the “corner,” and a host of private\r\nspeculators lost all they had. Daniel Drew came very near being swamped\r\nin it, but finally escaped with paying a million, chiefly through his\r\ninfluence at court.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to speak of the celebrated Erie “corners” here, as I\r\nhave treated them pretty fully in the life and speculations of Drew.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DANIEL DREW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                 DANIEL DREW.\r\n\r\n\r\nDREW, LIKE VANDERBILT, AN EXAMPLE OF GREAT SUCCESS WITHOUT\r\n    EDUCATION.—CONTROLLED MORE READY CASH THAN ANY MAN IN AMERICA.—DREW\r\n    GOES DOWN AS GOULD RISES.-“HIS TOUCH IS DEATH.”—PREDICTION OF DREW’S\r\n    FALL.—HIS THIRTEEN MILLIONS VANISH.—HOW HE CAUGHT THE OPERATORS IN\r\n    “OSHKOSH” BY THE HANDKERCHIEF TRICK.—THE BEGINNING OF “UNCLE\r\n    DANIEL’S” TROUBLES.—THE CONVERTIBLE BOND TRICK.—THE “CORNER” OF\r\n    1866.—MILLIONS LOST AND WON IN A DAY.—INTERESTING ANECDOTE OF THE\r\n    YOUTH WHO SPECULATED OUTSIDE THE POOL, AND WAS FED BY DREW’S\r\n    BROKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular and eventful careers in Wall Street was that of\r\nDaniel Drew, familiarly called “Uncle Daniel.” This man affords another\r\nremarkable instance of the possibility of attaining great success by\r\nstubbornly following up one idea, and one line of thought and purpose.\r\nHis life also shows that education is not necessary to success in the\r\nacquisition of money, but, as I have attempted to show in another\r\nchapter, may be a great hindrance.\r\n\r\nThis fact is abundantly illustrated in the lives of both Drew and\r\nVanderbilt. In fact, everybody who knew these two men were of the\r\nopinion that with a fair or liberal education they would never have cut\r\na prominent figure as financiers. It is also questionable whether either\r\nof them, with all their ability in other respects, would have been\r\ncapable, with their peculiar predilections for other pursuits, of\r\nreceiving a common school or college education. They, probably, had not\r\nthe capacity for that kind of acquisition. Perhaps it might have been\r\nimpossible for any teacher to make Drew pronounce the word shares\r\notherwise than “sheers,” or convince Vanderbilt that the part of a\r\nlocomotive in which, the steam is generated should not be spelt\r\nphonetically, “boylar.”\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that professors in grammar would have found it\r\na hopeless task to convince the Commodore that there was anything wrong\r\nin the expression, “Never tell nobody what yer goin’ to do, till you do\r\nit,” or Drew that it was improper to say to his broker, “Gimme them\r\nsheers,” when he desired his stocks reduced to possession. Both men\r\nseemed to think with the character in Shakespeare, that reading and\r\nwriting, like their other attributes, came by nature. They evidently\r\nthought that their abilities for financiering emanated solely from that\r\nsource, and results largely bore them out in that interpretation. Both\r\nhad supreme contempt for persons of less ability than themselves in the\r\nspeculative arena, yet they were terribly jealous of rivals who essayed\r\nto compete with them in their own peculiar methods of making money.\r\nCunning and shrewdness were the leading characteristics of Drew. Though\r\nilliterate himself, he, however, showed that he appreciated education in\r\nothers, by erecting and endowing a seminary in his native place.\r\n\r\nSome people who were not inclined to give Drew any credit for the finer\r\nand more generous and genial feelings of man’s nature, said that his\r\nmotive for this endowment was merely popularity, and a morbid desire,\r\nlike that of Vanderbilt, to perpetuate his name.\r\n\r\nAnother motive, however, less ennobling to man’s nature, seemed to be\r\nthe true one. He saw that the religious element in society was then\r\ninfluential, and that many religious people of his acquaintance were in\r\ngood circumstances, and he sought to ingratiate himself with them in\r\norder to make use of them in his speculations.\r\n\r\nThis appears clearly to have been at the bottom of his precious gift of\r\na seminary to his native county. It was a curious illustration of\r\nretributive justice, if I am right about his motive, that he was obliged\r\nto default in the payment of that gift, with the exception of the\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nDaniel Drew, at one time, could command more ready cash at short notice\r\nthan any man in Wall Street, or probably than any man in America. His\r\nwealth was estimated at thirteen million dollars. He made a very large\r\npart of this out of his speculations in Erie stock, of which corporation\r\nhe was then managing director and treasurer. Being thus on the inside,\r\nhe was enabled to leave everybody else on the outside in the ups and\r\ndowns of the market, which he himself generally engineered.\r\n\r\nThe Street was frequently amazed by fluctuations of 20 or 30 per cent.\r\nin Erie stock, sometimes in the course of a day or two, through the able\r\nmanipulation of Mr. Drew.\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry day for Drew when Jay Gould took his place in the control\r\nof Erie, and it was equally disastrous for the Erie property.\r\n\r\nFrom this period Gould began to grow rapidly to the full stature of\r\nspeculative manhood, while Drew moved as quickly in a downward\r\ndirection, until he found himself again at the lowest rung of the\r\nfinancial ladder. It was no wonder that he said of Gould, “his touch is\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nDrew’s losses followed one another in quick succession, until his\r\nthirteen millions had melted away like snow off a ditch, and eventually\r\nhe died in debt and broken hearted. His last days stand out as a sad,\r\nbut eloquent warning to the avaricious. And this reminds me of a festive\r\nevent, the chief incidents of which, I think, are worthy of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nI remember being at a dinner party ostensibly given to the old gentleman\r\nwhen in the very zenith of his financial fame and prosperity. It was a\r\nkind of mutual admiration society, Drew being the king-pin of the social\r\ncoterie. On account of his thirteen millions he was the centre of\r\ncringing admiration, and was by a number of the assemblage almost\r\ndeified.\r\n\r\nAs is usual on such occasions, speechmaking was in order, the oratorical\r\ntalent being called out by the toasts as they went the round of the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nWhen it came my turn to speak, I followed suit, to some extent, in\r\npicking up the thread of the general glorification extended to the\r\nhonored guest, to whom I paid marked deference.\r\n\r\n“We are honored,” I said, “on this festive occasion, by a gentleman of\r\nvast wealth, one who can control more ready money than any man in\r\nAmerica, and be it said to his honor, it has all been of his own\r\ncreation. He is a true representative of American thrift and enterprise.\r\nHis money and his genial disposition together combined make all men his\r\nfriends, and I know of only one antagonistic spirit to the continued\r\ngrowth of this already marvellous fortune; but that one, in all\r\nprobability, may yet work his ruin. I refer to our honored guest, Mr.\r\nDrew, and his one enemy which I have in mind is ‘Avarice.’”\r\n\r\nIn five years from that memorable dinner Daniel Drew was a ruined man,\r\nand his thirteen millions had vanished like the baseless fabric of a\r\nvision, leaving nothing but the miserable wreck of an avaricious spirit\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Drew was supposed to make religion the handmaid to\r\nspeculation was satirically touched in the following verses published in\r\nthe New York _Tribune_ about fifteen years ago:\r\n\r\n            He was a long, lank countryman,\r\n                And he stoppeth one of two.\r\n            “I’m not acquaint in these yeere parts,\r\n                An’ I’m a lookin’ fur Dan’l Drew.”\r\n\r\n            “I’m a stranger in the vineyard,\r\n                An’ my callin’ I pursoo\r\n            At the institoot at Madison,\r\n                That was built by Dan’l Drew.”\r\n\r\n            “I’m a stranger in the vineyard,\r\n                An’ my ’arthly wants are few;\r\n            But I want sum p’ints on them yer sheares,\r\n                An’ I’m a lookin’ fur Dan’l Drew.”\r\n\r\n            Again I saw that laborer,\r\n                Corner of Wall and New;\r\n            He was looking for a ferry boat,\r\n                And not for Daniel Drew.\r\n\r\n            Upon his back he bore a sack,\r\n                Inscribed “Preferred Q. U.”\r\n            Some Canton scrip was in his grip,\r\n                A little Wabash, too.\r\n\r\n            At the ferry gate I saw him late,\r\n                With his white hat askew,\r\n            Paying his fare with a registered share\r\n                Of that “Preferred Q. U.”\r\n\r\n            And these words came back from the “Hackensack:”\r\n                “Ef yew want ter gamble a few,\r\n            Jest git in yer paw at a game o’ draw,\r\n                But don’t take a ’and with Drew.”\r\n\r\nMr. Drew was negligent in his attire, even to the verge of slovenliness.\r\nHe dressed like a drover, having originally been employed in that\r\ncapacity. By the way, the significant term of “watering stock”\r\noriginated in the practice of Uncle Daniel giving his cattle salt in\r\norder to create a thirst in them that would cause them to imbibe large\r\nquantities of water, and thus appear bigger and fatter when brought to\r\nmarket. Until he met with Gould and Fisk, it was difficult for anybody\r\nto get the best of him in a deal.\r\n\r\nHe was wonderfully prolific in resources for the purpose of getting\r\nadvantage of those who attempted to overreach him.\r\n\r\nA good story, illustrative of this trait in his speculative character,\r\nis told of the time that he was so severely squeezed in Northwestern\r\nstock. He was greatly grieved at his ill luck, while the brokers and\r\noperators who had been prosperous at his expense were highly elated.\r\nThey considered it a great thing to have caught the wily old Daniel\r\nnapping. He was accordingly made the victim of much ribaldry and jesting\r\nfor several days in Wall Street. Some of the young men carried the joke\r\nso far as to meet him and laugh significantly and irritatingly in his\r\nface. He seemed to take it all in good part, for he had a happy flow of\r\nanimal spirits, but he had a terrible rod in pickle for these young men\r\nwho were making him an object of ridicule. He watched for his\r\nopportunity, and one evening as several of them were enjoying themselves\r\nin an uptown club, Uncle Daniel walked in, _sans ceremonie_. He appeared\r\nto be looking after some man, and though invited to remain, seemed to be\r\nin a great hurry to get away, and was apparently excited and warm. He\r\nseemed to have something important on hand. He drew a big white\r\nhandkerchief out of his pocket a few times and wiped the perspiration\r\nfrom his heated brow. When he was about to depart there came out of his\r\npocket with the handkerchief a small slip of white paper which floated\r\naround apparently unseen by him, and alighted at the feet of one of the\r\nbystanders, who quickly set his foot upon it. When Mr. Drew made his\r\nexit the white scrap of paper was instantly scanned. It contained these\r\nominous words in his own handwriting: “Buy me all the Oshkosh stock you\r\ncan at any price you can get it below par.”\r\n\r\nHere was a speculative revelation for the boys, for everybody believed\r\nat the time that Oshkosh had already gone too high, and the point had\r\nbeen circulated to sell it “short.” The mysterious words written on this\r\nerratic slip of paper, however, convinced these operators that there\r\nmust be a new deal to give Oshkosh another “kiting.” There was no time\r\nto be lost in taking advantage of the unexpected and highly valuable\r\ninformation. They formed a pool to purchase 30,000 shares the next day.\r\nThey bought the stock according to pre-arrangement, and a new broker of\r\nDaniel Drew’s was the man who sold it to them. They only discovered how\r\nbadly they themselves had been sold by Mr. Drew’s handkerchief trick\r\nwhen Oshkosh began to decline at the rate of a dozen points a day, and\r\nUncle Daniel soon raked in from the jokers and their friends more than\r\nhe had lost in Northwest.\r\n\r\nMr. Drew first entered the Board of Directors in Erie about the year\r\n1852, and remained there until he was squeezed out, and almost ruined,\r\nin 1868. He held the office of treasurer to the corporation.\r\n\r\nDrew was born in the town of Carmel, Putnam county, in the year 1797,\r\nand was three years younger than Vanderbilt. As I have intimated above,\r\nin early life he drove cattle from his native town to New York. He\r\nafterward became proprietor of the Bull’s Head tavern in this city.\r\n\r\nHe never changed his style of dress from that to which he was accustomed\r\nto wear when he was a drover, and when he was worth thirteen millions,\r\ninstead of sporting a gold headed cane, he went around Wall Street with\r\nthe handle of an old broken umbrella in his hand. While treasurer of\r\nErie he used every opportunity to manipulate the stock to his own\r\nadvantage, irrespective of the rights or interests of any other person.\r\nHe was the leading bear of the market for many years. Like Vanderbilt,\r\nhe was interested to some extent in steamboats, but he made Erie stock\r\nthe great medium of acquiring his vast wealth. He got the name of the\r\nspeculative director, and at the outbreak of what was known as the Erie\r\nwar he was supposed to be almost financially impregnable.\r\n\r\nThe “corner” of 1866 was the beginning of Uncle Daniel’s troubles. Up to\r\nthat period all had gone merry as a marriage bell with him, and he was\r\npiling up the millions at a rate which no other financier or speculator\r\nhad ever dared to imitate. Erie stock was selling at 95 in the spring of\r\nthat year. The company was badly off for money. It made application to\r\nits treasurer for the needed relief. He was ready to serve it in that\r\nway at all times, but he wanted security for the loan. There were then\r\n28,000 shares of unissued Erie stock. The company also claimed the right\r\nto raise money by the issue of bonds convertible into stock at the\r\noption of the holder.\r\n\r\nThis was an old trick in the management of Erie matters. It had saved\r\nJacob Little on one occasion, as I have mentioned in a former chapter,\r\nduring the earlier history of speculation in Wall Street. It was,\r\ntherefore, not original with the Drew management of Erie, as some people\r\nhave supposed.\r\n\r\nThe 28,000 shares of unissued stock then, and three millions of dollars\r\nof convertible bonds, were placed in the hands of Mr. Drew as security,\r\nand he advanced the loan of 3½ million dollars to relieve the pressing\r\nnecessities of the corporation.\r\n\r\nWhen Drew found himself thus fortified with the convertible bonds, he\r\nlaid another trap for the boys in the Street. Erie had been rapidly\r\nabsorbed for some time, and was very strong at 95 with anxious\r\npurchasers. The stock was, therefore, becoming very scarce. Mr. Drew had\r\na large number of contracts to fill, and operators were wondering where\r\nhe would get the stock to settle. Many of them were laughing in their\r\nsleeves at his impending embarrassment, as they had done on a former\r\noccasion, and were in ecstasies of delight at the idea of the terrific\r\n“squeeze” which the old man was about to experience. When he seemed on\r\nthe very horns of this dilemma, upon which the rampant bulls thought\r\nthey would successfully impale him, he converted his three million bonds\r\ninto an equivalent amount of stock, threw 58,000 shares on the market,\r\nmet all his contracts, and fed the voracious bulls with all they wanted.\r\n\r\nHungry as the Street had been for Erie, this was an overdose that it was\r\nutterly incapable of digesting. The bulls were paralyzed, and before\r\nthey could rally their broken ranks from the demoralizing effects of\r\nthis unexpected sortie from the stronghold of Erie, the stock had\r\ndeclined from 95 to 50, wiping out the broadest margins and putting the\r\nwhole army of bulls, reserve forces and all, to utter rout.\r\n\r\nMillions were lost and won in a day in this deal.\r\n\r\nThis was regarded as a grand _coup d’etat_, and one of Drew’s most\r\nbrilliant exploits in operating. In fact, at the time, it seemed to\r\nthrow every prior operation of this nature totally in the shade, and the\r\nother leading operators of the street were blue with envy, green with\r\njealousy, and raging mad over their losses and the way they had been\r\nentrapped and almost ruined by the deeply-laid scheme of the Erie\r\ntreasurer. Drew was despised, feared and revered on account of this\r\nunparalleled achievement. He then essayed to rest on his oars for a\r\nshort time, but his period of repose was but short-lived.\r\n\r\nThere was a little side-show in connection with the maturing of the\r\noperations in the pool just referred to, which is so characteristic of\r\nDaniel’s methods that it is worth relating. There was a young man in the\r\nErie pool, but not in the wheel-within-the-wheel in that sacred circle,\r\nwho imagined that the purpose of the pool was to put Erie stock up, and\r\naccordingly he borrowed money from Uncle Daniel, his credit being good\r\nand having money in the pool funds, to purchase Erie. The accommodating\r\ntreasurer not only lent him the money, but his private brokers sold the\r\nyoung man the Erie stock desired. He was duly fed from day to day with\r\nthe quantity which his speculative appetite craved. After the dump just\r\nreferred to, this unsophisticated youth and some other members of the\r\npool among his friends, went to Uncle Daniel and requested him, as\r\nmanager of the pool, according to the programme supposed to have been\r\nagreed upon, to put Erie again on the line of advance, in order that the\r\nyoung man and his friends might get in and out again, so as to cover\r\ntheir recent losses.\r\n\r\nMr. Drew, however, coolly informed them that the pool had no Erie stock\r\nand did not want any, and was not prepared to trade in that security any\r\nmore at that time.\r\n\r\n“I sold all our Arie at a profit,” said Uncle Daniel, “and am now ready\r\nto divide the money.”\r\n\r\nSo this youthful member had the felicity of discovering that while he\r\nwas speculating on his own account for a rise, Uncle Daniel was looking\r\nafter his interests in another direction, and had realized at the most\r\nopportune moment.\r\n\r\nThus this amateur operator, whom Uncle Daniel had amused, without\r\nletting him into the secret, in the way described, got nearly enough of\r\nmoney back to pay the loss he had sustained experimenting outside the\r\npool on his own account, and upon his own independent but fallacious\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nIf he had not speculated outside, he would have had very handsome\r\nprofits from the pool, but he would not have obtained the useful\r\nexperience which was connected with his losses, and the independent\r\nattitude he was ambitious to assume in speculations.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n             DREW AND VANDERBILT.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANDERBILT ESSAYS TO SWALLOW ERIE, AND HAS A NARROW ESCAPE\r\n    FROM CHOKING.—HE TRIES TO MAKE DREW COMMIT FINANCIAL\r\n    SUICIDE.—MANIPULATING THE STOCK MARKET AND THE LAW COURTS AT THE\r\n    SAME TIME.—ATTEMPTS TO “TIE UP” THE HANDS OF DREW.—MANUFACTURING\r\n    BONDS WITH THE ERIE PAPER MILL AND PRINTING PRESS.—FISK STEALS THE\r\n    BOOKS AND EVADES THE INJUNCTION.—DREW THROWS FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES\r\n    ON THE MARKET AND DEFEATS THE COMMODORE.—THE “CORNER” IS BROKEN AND\r\n    BECOMES A BOOMERANG.—VANDERBILT’S FURY KNOWS NO BOUNDS.—IN HIS RAGE\r\n    HE APPLIES TO THE COURTS.—THE CLIQUE’S INGLORIOUS FLIGHT TO JERSEY\r\n    CITY.—DREW CROSSES THE FERRY WITH SEVEN MILLIONS OF VANDERBILT’S\r\n    MONEY.—THE COMMODORE’S ATTEMPT TO REACH THE REFUGEES.—A DETECTIVE\r\n    BRIBES A WAITER AT TAYLOR’S HOTEL, WHO DELIVERS THE COMMODORE’S\r\n    LETTER, WHICH BRINGS DREW TO TERMS.—SENATOR MATTOON GETS “BOODLE”\r\n    FROM BOTH PARTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting episodes connected with the speculative life\r\nof Drew, in the somewhat sensational history of Erie affairs, was the\r\ninterposition of Commodore Vanderbilt in one of the famous deals of the\r\nErie clique. His object was to swallow up the corporation, and it came\r\npretty near swallowing him. He was only saved by the skin of the teeth,\r\nafter one of the most prolonged and desperate financial struggles of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain clearly the manner in which the Commodore became\r\ninvolved in the Erie matter with Drew and his partners, it will be\r\nnecessary to take a brief resume of the history of a few of his other\r\nprominent deals, more fully dwelt upon elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Harlem stock had sold as low as eight or nine dollars a share.\r\nIn January, 1863, when Vanderbilt got full control of the property, the\r\nstock had advanced to 30, and in July of the same year it had bounded to\r\n92. In August, when the “corner” was effected, it went to the remarkable\r\nfigure of 179.\r\n\r\nIt was put through a similar operation the succeeding year, and the\r\nstock, which sold in January below 90, was settled for in the following\r\nJune at 285. Drew had been drawn into one of these transactions, and his\r\nlosses reached nearly a million.\r\n\r\nVanderbilt’s prospects with the Harlem property were seriously menaced\r\nby the competition of the Hudson River railroad. He bought up the\r\ncompeting line, and thus destroyed the competition. He made this\r\npurchase when the stock was at par. He soon manifested his superior\r\npower in management, and displayed his skill in the art of “watering,”\r\nwhich he had invented. He had the stock advanced to 180 in a very short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSeeing his great success with these two properties, through his novel\r\nand unique methods of financiering, the managers of the New York\r\nCentral, thinking that discretion was the better part of valor, and\r\nperceiving that they could not hold out against the edicts of manifest\r\ndestiny very long, offered their property to him almost at his own\r\nprice, which he very cordially accepted, approving their good judgment\r\nand keen perception.\r\n\r\nHe obtained full control of New York Central early in 1867. As soon as\r\nthis triple amalgamation was complete he set his insatiable and\r\navaricious heart upon Erie, and essayed to compass his designs and\r\neffect his purpose of reducing it to possession through the speculative\r\nmachinery of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nIt was through this channel that he had obtained Hudson, and in defiance\r\nof the scientific maxim that lightning never strikes twice in the same\r\nplace, he was inspired with full confidence in his ability to “scoop”\r\nErie in the same manner. He tried first to arbitrate and consolidate,\r\nbut his efforts in that direction failed.\r\n\r\nWith all his marvellous foresight and almost unerring judgment in\r\nspeculative affairs, the Commodore was greatly at fault in his\r\ncalculation regarding the magnitude of the task he had now undertaken in\r\nErie. He had no idea of the immense volume of the stock which, after the\r\nspeculative battle began to rage, seemed to spring out of the ground,\r\nspontaneously, as the reserve troops of Wellington were said to appear\r\nto do in the eyes of Napoleon when the struggle waxed warm at Waterloo.\r\nHe had to contend with the ablest generals in speculation and finance\r\nthat ever Wall Street had produced. His first bold, flank movement was\r\nan attempt to “corner” Drew. He knew how to manipulate the courts almost\r\nas well as the Erie Ring did. Accordingly, he made use of the services\r\nof Frank Work to obtain an injunction from Judge Barnard, of Tweed Ring\r\nnotoriety, restraining Drew from the payment of interest on 3½ million\r\nbonds, pending an investigation of his accounts as treasurer of Erie.\r\nThis was followed up in a few days by another application to the court\r\nfor the treasurer’s removal from office.\r\n\r\nThese measures were resorted to by Vanderbilt to prevent the issue of\r\nthis stock, into which these 3½ million bonds were convertible, and thus\r\nenable him to get a “corner” in the stock with greater facility. He thus\r\nattempted to make the court instrumental in forcing Drew into a position\r\nwhere he would be obliged to commit financial suicide.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Ring had managed to get legally around what in reality was an\r\nover-issue of Erie stock and bonds in the following subtle manner:\r\n\r\nThere was a statute of New York which authorized any railroad to create\r\nand issue its own stock in exchange for the stock of any other road\r\nunder lease to it. The Ring had obtained the Buffalo, Bradford &\r\nPittsburg road, which was comparatively worthless, for carrying out this\r\nscheme. The Erie management then set about supplying themselves with the\r\namount of Erie stock required, by leasing their own road to the road of\r\nwhich they were directors. They then created stock and issued it to\r\nthemselves in exchange under the authority vested in them by law.\r\n\r\nThe nominal price of the road with which they worked this game of\r\nlegerdemain was $250,000. They issued bonds in its name for two millions\r\nof dollars, payable to one of themselves as trustee.\r\n\r\nVanderbilt, before he could get a “corner” in Erie, had to place a limit\r\nto the issue of the stock. Otherwise he would have been throwing away\r\nmillions, like pouring water into a sieve, in his attempt to make a\r\n“corner.”\r\n\r\nDrew was enjoined by the Commodore to return to the Treasury 68,000\r\nshares of the capital stock of Erie. This was the amount that was said\r\nto remain in the unsettled transactions of the Erie corner of 1866. This\r\nwas the sword of Damocles which Vanderbilt had suspended over Drew’s\r\ndevoted head.\r\n\r\nVanderbilt thus undertook to play the double game of manipulating the\r\ncourts and the stock market at the same time, and against wily\r\nopponents, who were experts in both operations.\r\n\r\nThere were at this time three competitors for the possession of Erie in\r\nthe field. The Drew party, the Vanderbilt party, and the Boston,\r\nHartford and Erie party. Drew had tried to appease Vanderbilt to some\r\nextent, and had an interview with him at Vanderbilt’s own house prior to\r\nthe election of the Erie directors. He agreed to “let up” on Vanderbilt,\r\nand offered him greater swing in purchasing Erie, while, on the other\r\nhand, Vanderbilt consented not to press the proceedings in court against\r\nDrew.\r\n\r\nBefore this, the Boston party and Vanderbilt had been fixing matters to\r\noust Drew from the Erie directory. Now, Vanderbilt changed his tactics,\r\nand resolved to let Drew remain. The Boston party was with him, but to\r\nkeep up the appearance of what had been formerly determined, the new\r\nboard was to be elected ostensibly without Drew, and a vacancy created\r\nafterwards by which he could be chosen in the board. This method of\r\nwhipping the Devil around the stump was adopted to put public opinion\r\noff its guard, and help to forward Vanderbilt’s purposes of\r\nconsolidation. The election scheme was successfully effected, but the\r\nruse, though well conceived, fell far short of accomplishing its\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nThere were wheels within wheels during this speculative deal. Drew and\r\nVanderbilt entered into a secret alliance to exclude the Boston party,\r\nwho was Vanderbilt’s ally. The new board was elected, leaving Drew out.\r\nThis was a surprise to Wall Street, but a greater surprise was in store\r\nfor it when a vacancy was created the next day, and Drew was re-elected\r\nto the Erie Board of Directors. The Street was confused and confounded,\r\nand at a loss to know how to act, and the Boston party was groping\r\naround to find out where it stood. Frank Work was elected to the Erie\r\nBoard in the Vanderbilt interest. A pool was then formed to put up Erie,\r\nas it was in a very depressed condition. Drew was to manage the pool and\r\nmanipulate the market.\r\n\r\nThe proposed plan for consolidating with the Vanderbilt interests failed\r\nbecause the Erie people said that the great railroad king would only\r\nconsent to give them one-third of the earnings, while they contributed\r\nmore than half to the pool. So, when this scheme collapsed, Vanderbilt\r\nwent on the speculative war path, and determined to snatch Erie from the\r\nhands of the Ring in the way he had obtained Hudson. He began his\r\noperations about the middle of February, 1868, and pursued his policy in\r\nthe courts for the purpose of limiting the apparently unlimited supply\r\nof Erie stock.\r\n\r\nIn the leasing process above referred to with the Buffalo, Bradford &\r\nPittsburgh, the Erie clique added $140,000 a year to its income.\r\n\r\nMr. Work got an additional injunction to prevent Erie from issuing stock\r\nin addition to the 251,058 shares which had appeared in the previous\r\nreport of the road, and forbidding a guarantee by Erie of the bonds of\r\nany other road, and Drew was further restrained from any transactions in\r\nErie until he should return the 68,000 shares of capital stock to the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Vanderbilt had taken very rigid measures to\r\n“tie up” the hands of the veteran speculator.\r\n\r\nThe case was set down for hearing in the court of the immaculate Judge\r\nBarnard, on the 10th of March. When Vanderbilt thought he had everything\r\nfixed to force Drew to ruin himself by the return of these shares, which\r\nwould enable Vanderbilt to effect his “corner,” he was checkmated by a\r\ncounter injunction issued in the interest of the Erie people by Judge\r\nBalcom, of Binghamton, which stayed all proceedings in Barnard’s court.\r\n\r\nRichard Schell then applied to Judge Ingraham and got out another\r\ninjunction in the interest of the Vanderbilt party, staying all\r\nproceedings before Judge Balcom.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Erie directors were busy preparing their new issue\r\nof stock, despite the injunctions, in order that the bulls of the\r\nVanderbilt party might be generously fed with Erie when the opportunity\r\nshould arrive.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of Erie resolved to issue bonds for\r\nimprovements, extensions and steel rails. The bonds were convertible\r\ninto stock at not less than 72½. Five millions of these were\r\nmanufactured by the Erie paper mill and printing press, to be exchanged\r\nfor Vanderbilt’s good, solid cash.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty presented itself at this juncture, which, even to the\r\nmajority of clever speculators, would have been insurmountable. The\r\ngenius of “Jim” Fisk was called in to cut the Gordian knot. The\r\ncertificates of the new Erie shares were in the hands of the secretary\r\nof the company, but he was enjoined from issuing them. They had been\r\nmade out on Saturday night. On Monday the secretary directed a\r\nmessenger, in the Erie office in West street, to take the books\r\ncontaining the certificates to the transfer office in Pine street. The\r\nmessenger took the books and walked out. He was hardly a minute absent\r\nwhen he returned, apparently frightened, without the books. He stated\r\nthat Mr. Fisk, who had been standing at the door, took the books from\r\nhim, and ran away with them!\r\n\r\nThe certificates were then where no injunction could molest them. The\r\nnext day the convertible bonds were found upon the secretary’s desk. In\r\na day or two afterwards the certificates appeared in Wall Street. An\r\norder was obtained from Judge Gilbert enjoining all the previous orders\r\nof that legal luminary, Judge Barnard. Mr. Drew then threw 50,000 shares\r\nof Erie stock on the market. The boldness of the operation threw the\r\nVanderbilt brokers off their guard, for it never struck them for a\r\nmoment that Drew would risk contempt of court, and use the new issue of\r\nErie in the face of an injunction, so they eagerly devoured the fresh\r\nbait before they got time to examine the quality of it or suspect its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nErie had opened at 80, and advanced to 83. When the facts became known\r\nthe stock broke, and declined to 71; but under heavy purchases by the\r\nVanderbilt party, soon recovered to 78. The “corner,” however, was\r\nbroken by the large blocks which Drew had thrown on the market, and\r\nVanderbilt was signally defeated, and had a narrow escape from being\r\ncompletely swamped. The corner proved a boomerang to Vanderbilt. In his\r\nwrath he again applied to the courts. As the result, the Erie clique\r\nwere obliged to fly and take refuge in Jersey City. Drew crossed the\r\nferry heavily loaded with a big carpet bag, which contained seven\r\nmillions, which had recently changed hands from Vanderbilt to himself in\r\nthe cornering operation.\r\n\r\nGould and Fisk decamped by different routes. When the party had taken\r\nrefuge in “Fort” Taylor (Taylor’s Hotel), safe from the laws of New\r\nYork, they determined that no papers should be served upon them, and\r\ngave strict orders to the host that they would not receive anything in\r\nthe shape of letters or notes. Communications of all kinds were\r\nprohibited except through persons well known to the clique, and the\r\nwaiters at the hotel were strictly enjoined to observe this rule, on\r\npain of being discharged.\r\n\r\nWhile Vanderbilt was working hard to reach the refugees through the\r\ncourts, the Legislature and his detectives, he discovered a method of\r\ncommunicating with Drew in spite of the precautions with which the\r\nlatter was surrounded. The Commodore’s scheme would have done honor to a\r\nfirst-class Nihilist of the present day. He instructed a person in his\r\nservice to play temporary detective, to go to the Taylor Hotel in the\r\ngarb of a commercial traveler from the Far West, and to watch the\r\nmovements of Drew, so as to get a note slipped into his hand in a way\r\nthat he would be certain to read it.\r\n\r\nThe amateur detective watched for a day or two, and saw that his only\r\nchance of success was when Drew was at lunch, and that the person who\r\nwaited on him must hand him the note. He saw the waiter, and told him\r\nwhat he wanted, and that when he should be discharged the Commodore\r\nwould find him a better place.\r\n\r\nThe waiter agreed to hand Mr. Drew the note. Drew was enraged, sent for\r\nthe host, and the waiter was instantly discharged, only to enter\r\nVanderbilt’s service, according to agreement, at much higher\r\nremuneration. The note of the Commodore, however, had the desired\r\neffect. What that note contained, probably, nobody but Vanderbilt and\r\nDrew ever knew. Though the friends of Drew attempted to frighten him\r\nfrom going by arousing his suspicions of being kidnapped, he came over\r\nto New York on the following Sunday and had an interview with the\r\nCommodore. The matter was fixed up between them, and while Gould and\r\nFisk were fighting Vanderbilt tooth and nail at Albany, and Gould was\r\narrested and arraigned for contempt of court and other high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors in the eyes of the Vanderbilt lawyers, Drew was left\r\nunmolested to pursue the even tenor of his way.\r\n\r\nAs treasurer of Erie, however, Drew took an active part in the progress\r\nof legislative matters. He was the first to see that Senator Mattoon,\r\nwho was chiefly instrumental in organizing the Investigating Committee,\r\nwanted tangible recognition of his services before the Committee made\r\nits report. He thought he was using Mattoon, but the Senator used him,\r\nand gave his casting vote in favor of Vanderbilt, whom he used also,\r\nafter the most approved method of Albany legislators. Mattoon was also\r\nfound on the winning side at the end of the legislative farce, when the\r\nbill in favor of the Erie clique and its over-issue of stock was passed,\r\nand no doubt got his fair share of the half million with which Drew\r\nfortified Gould from the Erie treasury when this gentleman went to\r\nAlbany to conduct the war in the Legislature against Vanderbilt\r\nconcerning the extra issue of Erie stock.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n         DREW AND THE ERIE “CORNERS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA HARMONIOUS UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMODORE.—HOW THE COMPROMISE WAS\r\n    EFFECTED.—AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW WITH FISK AND GOULD IN THE\r\n    COMMODORE’S BED-ROOM.—HOW RICHARD SCHELL RAISED THE WIND FOR THE\r\n    COMMODORE.—DREW’S SHARE OF THE SPOILS.—HE TRIES TO RETIRE FROM WALL\r\n    STREET, BUT CAN’T.—THE SETTLEMENT COST ERIE NINE MILLIONS.—GOULD AND\r\n    FISK “WATER” ERIE AGAIN, TO THE EXTENT OF TWENTY-THREE MILLIONS, BUT\r\n    LEAVE DREW OUT.-“UNCLE DANIEL” RETURNS TO THE STREET.—HE IS\r\n    INVEIGLED INTO A BLIND POOL BY GOULD AND FISK, LOSES A MILLION AND\r\n    RETREATS FROM THE POOL.—HE THEN OPERATES ALONE ON THE “SHORT” SIDE\r\n    AND THROWS AWAY MILLIONS.—HE TRIES PRAYER, BUT IT “AVAILETH\r\n    NOT.”-“IT’S NO USE, BROTHER, THE MARKET STILL GOES UP.”—PRAYING AND\r\n    WATCHING THE TICKER.—HOPELESSLY “CORNERED” AND RUINED BY HIS FORMER\r\n    PUPILS AND PARTNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of April Drew emerged from his retreat in Jersey City,\r\nand appeared openly in Wall Street, apparently without any fear of\r\narrest. Other members of the Erie clique had gone through the formality\r\nof purging their contempt of court, but had not made their peace with\r\nthe Commodore, and things went forward without any special interruption\r\nor excitement until July, when a settlement was made with Vanderbilt.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the Commodore should be relieved of 50,000 shares of\r\nErie stock at 70, for which he was to receive $2,500,000 in cash, and\r\n$1,250,000 in bonds of the Boston, Hartford & Erie at 80. It was further\r\nstipulated that he was to receive $1,000,000 for the privilege of\r\ncalling on him at any time within four months for the remaining 50,000\r\nshares of Erie at 70. He was allotted two seats in the Erie Board of\r\nDirectors. All suits between the two high contending parties were to be\r\ndismissed and all offenses whatsoever relating to the case, in the\r\nlanguage of the law, were to be condoned.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the compromise was effected is not the least\r\ninteresting part of the famous deal in Erie. Some time after Drew had\r\ngot through his famous Sunday evening interview with the Commodore,\r\npaving the way for his partners, by weeping and showing other\r\nmanifestations of deep contrition on account of his inglorious flight to\r\nJersey City, Gould and Fisk came over early one morning to see the\r\nCommodore at his residence in Washington Place. Fisk told the story of\r\nmeeting the Commodore with great unction, in his bold, brazen and lively\r\nmanner. “Gould wanted to wait,” said Fisk, “until the Commodore should\r\nhave time to get out of bed, but I rang the bell, and when the door was\r\nopened I rushed up to his room. The Commodore was sitting on the side of\r\nthe bed with one shoe off and one shoe on. He got up, and I saw him\r\nputting on the other shoe. I remember that shoe from its peculiarity. It\r\nhad four buckles on it. I had never seen shoes with buckles in that\r\nmanner before, and I thought, if these sort of men always wear that sort\r\nof shoe, I might want a pair. He said I must take my position as I found\r\nit; that there I was, and he would keep his bloodhounds (the lawyers) on\r\nour track; that he would be damned if he didn’t keep them after us if we\r\ndidn’t take the stock off his hands. I told him that if I had my way,\r\nI’d be damned if I would take a share of it; that he brought the\r\npunishment on himself and he deserved it. This mellowed him down. I told\r\nhim that he was a robber. He said the suits would never be withdrawn\r\ntill he was settled with. I said (after settling with him) that it was\r\nan almighty robbery; that we had sold ourselves to the Devil, and that\r\nGould felt just the same as I did.”\r\n\r\nAmong the friends who adhered to the Commodore in the trying hour of the\r\n“corner,” besides those mentioned, were William Heath, Richard Schell\r\nand his brother Augustus, and Rufus Hatch. Richard Schell was highly\r\npractical and remarkably shrewd in the aid which he offered the\r\nCommodore to obtain money for the speculative fight. He managed, through\r\nhis tact and shrewdness, to get loans on Erie after the banks had\r\nabsolutely refused to lend, on account of the over-issue of the stock.\r\nAfter this refusal, he made inquiry at the banks, and found that most of\r\nthem had New York Central stock. He then went to a bank and said: “If\r\nyou don’t lend the Commodore half a million on Erie at 60, he will put\r\nCentral down to 50 to-morrow, and break half the houses on the Street.\r\nYou know whether or not you will be among them.”\r\n\r\nThe threat was repeated at other banks, and, in almost every instance,\r\nhad the desired effect, and the Commodore was supplied with the sinews\r\nof war, but he was only throwing away his ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe Erie stock from the inexhaustible fountain of over-issue was\r\nsupplied to him without stint, and his attempts to “corner” the clique\r\nwere absolutely futile.\r\n\r\nWhile these gamesters were feeding the Commodore with this extemporized\r\nstuff to order, Fisk said: “If this printing press don’t break down,\r\nI’ll be d—d if I don’t give the old hog all he wants of Erie.”\r\n\r\nThe printing press did not break down, but did its work well until the\r\nCommodore was nearly “burst,” and had it not been for his indomitable\r\ncourage and the hold he had acquired on the courts, he would have been\r\nbankrupt. His escape seemed almost a miracle to the people of Wall\r\nStreet, and Gould and Fisk were not less surprised that they had met a\r\nfoeman worthy of their steel. In spite of the fact that he spilled over\r\nseven millions like water, the Commodore managed to sustain the market\r\nthrough it all, and prevented a crash that, in its local effects, at\r\nleast, would have been as disastrous as that of Black Friday.\r\n\r\nCertain innocent holders who had been badly crushed in the collision\r\nbetween the great leaders received a financial emollient for their\r\nlacerated feelings, amounting in the aggregate to $429,250. The Boston\r\nparty, represented by Mr. Eldridge, was to be relieved of five millions\r\nof its precious Boston, Hartford & Erie bonds, receiving therefor four\r\nmillions of Erie acceptances.\r\n\r\nThus, the settlement in full cost Erie about nine million dollars. The\r\nErie stock and bondholders were saddled with this liability in defiance\r\nof law and justice.\r\n\r\nGould and Fisk pretended to be opposed to the settlement, leaving the\r\npublic to infer that it was all the work of Drew with Vanderbilt.\r\nHowever this may have been, it was probably the best thing the others\r\ncould have done to relieve themselves of their various complications at\r\nthe time. No doubt the Vanderbilt note to Drew, for which the waiter was\r\ndischarged from Taylor’s Hotel, was at the bottom of the whole\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nDrew was left to enjoy his share of the fruits of the “corner,” which\r\nnetted seven millions, except that he had to pay into the Erie treasury\r\nthe trifling item of $540,000 in discharge of interest and all claims or\r\ncauses of action which might be presented against him by the Erie\r\nCompany. The Erie Railway fell to the lot of Gould and Fisk as their\r\nshare of the spoils growing out of the _entente cordiale_.\r\n\r\nDrew then retired from Wall Street in the same way that Gould has so\r\noften retired since that time, except that Drew had probably an honest\r\nintention so far as it was possible for him to have such a conception of\r\nleaving the Street forever, but it would seem that he had not the power\r\nto do so. Once in Wall Street, always in Wall Street. It is like the\r\ndoctrine of the final perseverance of the saints, as laid down in the\r\nWestminster Confession of Faith. It is impossible to get out of it when\r\nthe speculator gets fairly into its fascinating grasp.\r\n\r\nDrew might have enjoyed life and the consolations of religion on the few\r\nmillions he had left if he had retired in company with his Bible and\r\nHymn Book, to some lovely, secluded spot in the peaceful vales of Putnam\r\ncounty; but he was under the infatuation of some latent and mysterious\r\nforce or attraction, the victim of some potent spell, like the one in\r\nwhose weird grasp Nancy Sykes was firmly held when she essayed to get\r\naway from the murderous “Bill,” as described by Dickens in Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nDrew came back to Wall Street, and saw and was vanquished, quite unlike\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the “Street” after a few months absence, the scene\r\nwas greatly changed. His two pupils had shown themselves to be such apt\r\nscholars, that in the interim they had exceeded the wildest dreams of\r\navarice that ever their able preceptor had conjured up or inculcated. In\r\nfour months Gould and Fisk had inflated the capital stock of Erie from\r\n34 millions to 57 millions. No doubt, Uncle Daniel was astounded at\r\ntheir progress, and his feelings can be better imagined than described\r\nwhen, in the presence of this marvellous increase of wealth, he\r\nreflected that he was no longer treasurer of Erie, and had neither lot\r\nnor part in its unprecedented prosperity.\r\n\r\nHis natural propensity to operate, however, was still strong, but when\r\nhe again tried his hand at speculation, it seemed to have lost its\r\ncunning, and he felt almost as much disappointed as Rip Van Winkle did\r\nwhen he awoke in Sleepy Hollow, after his twenty years’ nap, and began\r\nto examine the changed aspect of the country in the vicinity of\r\nIrvington, now Gould’s country seat.\r\n\r\nThe speculative tactics in operation had been changed, and he soon found\r\nthat it was a losing game to go on the bear side of the market. He was\r\ninvited into the pool by his old partners, to have a little practice at\r\nthe popular game of spider and fly. Drew had been the spider for a long\r\ntime who had inveigled the unwary flies from every direction into his\r\ninsidious net. He was now asked to assume the role of a fly, while his\r\nformer pupils played spiders. In plain terms, he was coolly requested to\r\ngo into a “blind pool” in Erie, deposit four millions, shut his eyes and\r\nopen his mouth, leaving the Erie sharpers to put taffy or candy into it,\r\njust as they pleased.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer to have the privilege of pulling the wires, nor the\r\nwool over other people’s eyes. On the contrary, he was to be one of the\r\npuppets that should dance to the music of Gould and Fisk, and let them\r\npull the wool over his eyes. He was not to ask any questions, but pay\r\nhis money and take his choice, that is to say, whatever Gould and Fisk\r\nchose to give him. The terms were rather humiliating, and on reflection,\r\nUncle Daniel revolted. He did not see the point of paying the piper\r\nwithout having the privilege of choosing the tune. He, therefore,\r\nwithdrew his funds after losing a million, and undertook the task of\r\nbearding these two young lions in their den—the den which he had\r\nconstructed for them, and the two young lions which he had so carefully\r\nnurtured to destroy him. They were very wroth with him on account of\r\nwhat they regarded as his treachery, which virtually consisted in his\r\nrefusal to be totally devoured by them. The fact is, however, Daniel\r\ncould not have been true to any one, any more than they. “Can the\r\nEthiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?”\r\n\r\nAfter considering the matter prayerfully, as he always did in such\r\nemergencies, he resolved to operate alone, and the oracle told him to go\r\non the short side. It was evident that the Gods had doomed him to\r\ndestruction, so he rushed in madly to sell the market, which moved\r\npersistently upward.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency he took counsel of a Christian brother, who advised\r\nhim to pray. He tried hard to pray, but his irresistible desire to keep\r\nconstant watch on the tape of the ticker, to see the quotations,\r\nevidently distracted his devotions. This was probably the first time\r\nthat he lost faith in the power that moves the arm that moves the world.\r\nHe went to his Christian brother with tears in his eyes, saying: “It is\r\nno use, brother; the market still goes up.” And Uncle Daniel ceased to\r\npray, and despairingly fixed his attention on the ticker.\r\n\r\nDaring November, Drew contracted for the delivery of 70,000 shares of\r\nErie at current prices. It was then in the vicinity of 38. He proceeded\r\non this line of operation until he was hopelessly “cornered.” He then\r\napplied to the court. Application was made for an injunction in the name\r\nof August Belmont, but Gould and Fisk offset it by applying for another\r\ninjunction to their faithful Barnard. That upright Judge not only\r\ngranted an injunction restraining all suits brought against his two\r\neminent protegés, but appointed Gould Receiver of Erie. He also gave\r\nauthority to the directors of Erie to use the funds of the corporation\r\nto purchase and cancel 200,000 shares of stock, the legality of whose\r\nissue had been questioned, at any price less than the par value, without\r\nregard to the rate at which it had been issued.\r\n\r\nGould and Fisk had issued these shares in the bear interest at 40, ran\r\nthe stock down to 35, and now obtained the power to purchase it back at\r\npar in the bull interest. This they did by the authority and permission\r\nof a Judge of the Supreme Court, in spite of the law prohibiting members\r\nof corporations to deal in their own stock. So these two great\r\nmanipulators “cornered” their old friend and teacher, Drew, by legally\r\nover-riding the law.\r\n\r\nErie became scarce after this skilful movement was performed, and was\r\nselling at 47. Drew made desperate attempts to cover at this price, but\r\nthe stock ran up to 57 between Monday and Wednesday. Wall Street was in\r\na terrible ferment, and, as the newspapers say, the greatest excitement\r\nprevailed. Erie made still another leap and reached 62. It was evident\r\nthat it was bound to keep on the upward grade, and there was no apparent\r\nrelief for Drew, at least for two or three days, when an incoming\r\nsteamer was expected to have a considerable amount of Erie on board. It\r\nwas manifest, however, that by that time Drew would have reached the end\r\nof his millions, and probably most of his credit would have vanished\r\nwith his own filthy lucre. His oppressors were bearing down upon him\r\nwith all their might, and were evidently determined to make short work\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nThe struggle waxed hotter as the hour of three in the afternoon\r\napproached, and these two young lions of speculation were determined to\r\ncrush the old bear unmercifully and effectually.\r\n\r\nWhen Drew was apparently on the very brink of utter financial\r\ndestruction, and almost at the close of the market, two events happened\r\nthat preserved him from total annihilation. There had been 300,000\r\nshares of Erie issued in ten share lots, which the operators thought\r\nwere safely secreted in London and Amsterdam. When the stock reached 60\r\nthese ten-share lots began to come out. It turned out that most of them\r\nhad never left home, but were securely had by tradesmen, mechanics,\r\ngrocers and small bankers and brokers. They were thrown on the market\r\nwith great rapidity to realize handsome profits, and the efforts of the\r\nclique to absorb them before they got into the hands of Drew, made\r\nserious inroads on the reserve funds of the champion operators. As\r\ntroubles never come singly, at this new juncture the banks refused to\r\ncertify their checks. Drew was, therefore, enabled to make good his\r\ncontracts at 47, but speculatively speaking, he was ruined. He came\r\npretty near bringing down his desperate assailants, however, in his sad\r\nand frightful fall. The stock then fell to 42, and Erie became a drug in\r\nthe market. The victors had got the spoils, but they paid dearly for\r\nthem, and had come pretty near being destroyed in the moment of their\r\ntriumph. They had purchased their Erie at “corner” prices, and they were\r\nobliged to carry it, for nobody wanted it. Added to this Erie was struck\r\nfrom the Board for a time, and had it not been for the gullibility of\r\nour English cousins, this stock would have ceased to be a disturbing\r\nelement in the market for a great while longer.\r\n\r\nAlthough old Drew was badly treated, yet there was little sympathy for\r\nhim, since he had merely become the victim of his own avarice,\r\nvacillation, treachery and scheming to catch others in the same net.\r\n\r\nHe could not justly complain of his former partners, and Fisk told him\r\nso, for their methods of operation, and the immense inflation of the\r\nErie stock by which he was ruined had been accomplished by the machinery\r\nwhich he, himself, had set in motion, only his _ci-devant_ colleagues\r\nhad improved upon it, and had received various new patents on inventions\r\nand improvements, which they had joined to the old one invented by\r\n“Uncle Daniel,” mating one of the best combinations for the purpose of\r\ncreating and working “corners” that had ever been devised in Wall\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nBut the unkindest cut of all was the way in which Fisk taunted him, on\r\nthe eve of his crushing defeat, with the absurdity of his complaints\r\nabout the management of Erie matters.\r\n\r\n“You should be the last man,” said this worthy pupil, sneeringly, to his\r\ndear old preceptor, “that should whine over any position in which you\r\nmay be placed in Erie.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sad truth, heartlessly uttered by the generous “Jim.” Drew had\r\nno mercy on others, and could not expect to be shown any of that “twice\r\nblessed quality” towards himself.\r\n\r\nThe private scene in the Erie office between old Drew and Fisk and\r\nGould, just prior to their final and victorious charge upon him, was\r\ndeeply pathetic, yet none of the three showed more conspicuously that\r\nthey were destitute of that proverbial honor among “boodlers” than Drew\r\nhimself. He had secured Vanderbilt to assist him in the courts, and also\r\nin the market, against the machinations of the Erie clique, and then,\r\nturning around, he went straight to Gould. and to him betrayed his ally\r\nand the plans he had arranged with him, expecting mercy from his old\r\ncolleague by this dastardly act of humiliation and deception.\r\n\r\nHe must have lost his head at this crisis, for he ought to have known\r\nGould better. He begged and pleaded with Gould and Fisk, and was ready\r\nto throw himself at their feet. He implored them to join him, with the\r\nremnant of his fortune, in giving the old paper mill another turn to\r\ngrind out more Erie stock, that he might be permitted to emerge from\r\nthat cruel “corner” in which he was placed like a scorpion girt by fire,\r\nbrooding over his guilty woes.\r\n\r\nBut his pupils proved that they had profited only too well by his\r\ninstructions. Just as he would have acted under similar circumstances,\r\nthey were perfectly relentless. They seemed to be a double incarnation\r\nof Shylock personified, or two Dromios bereft of conscience and human\r\nsympathy. Drew had no Daniel but himself, to come to judgment. There was\r\nno fair Portia to plead his cause, and if there had been such an angelic\r\ncreature in the case, though she might have “broke up” Fisk, it is\r\nalmost certain that Gould would have successfully resisted her charms.\r\n\r\nWhen Drew saw they were implacable he bade them good night, and with the\r\ncourage of despair returned to the charge in Wall Street the next\r\nmorning, with the results which have been briefly related. He lost\r\nnearly two millions in that fatal struggle.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     INTERESTING EPISODES IN DREW’S LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS IN THE EARLY LIFE OF DREW, AND HOW HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY.—HE\r\n    BORROWS MONEY FROM HENRY ASTOR, BUYS CATTLE IN OHIO AND DRIVES THEM\r\n    OVER THE ALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS UNDER GREAT HARDSHIP AND SUFFERING.—HIS\r\n    GREAT CAREER AS A STEAMBOAT MAN, AND HIS OPPOSITION TO\r\n    VANDERBILT.—HIS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY.—HE BUILDS AND ENDOWS RELIGIOUS\r\n    AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.—RETURNS TO HIS OLD HOME AFTER HIS\r\n    SPECULATIVE FALL, BUT CAN FIND NO REST SO FAR AWAY FROM WALL\r\n    STREET.—HIS HOPES, THROUGH WM. H. VANDERBILT, OF ANOTHER START IN\r\n    LIFE.—HIS BANKRUPTCY, LIABILITIES AND WARDROBE.—HIS SUDDEN BUT\r\n    PEACEFUL END.—CHARACTERISTIC STORIES OF HIS ECCENTRICITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had intended at first to give only a sketch of the salient points in\r\nthe speculative career of Drew, but, on reflection, I find that the\r\nlives of great men all remind us that people want to know a great deal\r\nof minutiæ concerning men who have made their mark in this world. Our\r\nenterprising newspapers are encouraging this laudable curiosity more and\r\nmore every day. So in the case of Drew, I must try to furnish answers to\r\nquestions that may be asked about him in order that popular expectation\r\nmay not be disappointed. I shall endeavor to anticipate what the reader\r\nmay naturally want to know when he comes to the end of Drew’s great\r\nspeculative ventures. One of these questions will probably be, what kind\r\nof a boy was Daniel Drew, and how did he begin to make money?\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Drew was the most unique figure that Wall\r\nStreet has ever seen, and a characteristic specimen of one kind of\r\nAmerican thrift, enterprise and speculation. Every side of his\r\nmany-sided and peculiar character, therefore, is of interest as the\r\nrepresentative of a class to the reader who sets his heart on making\r\nmoney, and the majority of readers have this weakness. He is of special\r\ninterest to all speculators not only in this country, but throughout the\r\ncivilized world. These facts constitute my apology for dwelling so long\r\nand minutely on his characteristics. I have an idea that his life and\r\nadventures will be read with deep interest many years hence, and help to\r\nprolong the existence and reputation of this book. They will also assist\r\nto immortalize the man who was one of the most wonderful products of\r\nAmerican civilization, and who could hardly have been evolved from any\r\nother soil or clime. Such prodigies of success cause the members of the\r\nolder social fabrics to stare with astonishment at the stupendous\r\ncapabilities of our great country.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing interests people so much as the start in life, probably\r\nbecause there are so few who consider themselves able to get a good\r\nstart. So far as I can learn, in the case of Daniel Drew, the boy was\r\nfather to the man. He worked on a farm, going to school at intervals,\r\nwhere he was unable to learn anything, except that he obtained a notion\r\nof the current theological ideas of that day, until he was fifteen years\r\nof age, when his father died, leaving him, a younger brother and their\r\nmother to shift for themselves on a poor, small farm. His father was of\r\nEnglish and his mother of Scotch descent.\r\n\r\nIn his seventeenth year young Drew enlisted as a substitute in the State\r\nMilitia, which had then been called into service on account of the\r\nsecond war with England.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was placed at Fort Gansevoort, on the Hudson, opposite New\r\nYork. Hostilities ceased between this country and England a few months\r\nafter his enlistment, and the regiment was mustered out. Daniel returned\r\nhome. His mother had taken charge of his substitute money, which\r\nprobably did not exceed a hundred dollars, the amount with which his\r\ngreat rival, Commodore Vanderbilt commenced life, and which he earned\r\nfrom his mother by ploughing and planting a field.\r\n\r\n“I want my substitute money,” said Drew to his mother, one day shortly\r\nafter his return. “What are you going to do with it?” queried the old\r\nwoman, for being of Scotch descent, she was quite as thrifty in looking\r\nafter the pennies as her American contemporary, old Mrs. Vanderbilt.\r\nThey both had the gripping sense by nature, and to this transmissible\r\nquality may probably be attributed, in a large degree, the financial\r\nsuccess of both of their sons.\r\n\r\n“I am going to buy cattle, and sell them in New York,” replied Daniel.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you will not lose money by it?” rejoined his mother.\r\n\r\n“I am sure I will make money,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe started to purchase cattle in the country and to sell them in New\r\nYork. His profits were at first very small, especially as his capital\r\nwas so limited. He soon discovered that if he could purchase his cattle\r\nin Ohio he would be able to increase his profits largely, and he applied\r\nto Henry Astor, a butcher in Fulton Market, and a brother of the great\r\nmillionaire, John Jacob Astor, for a loan to speculate in Ohio cattle.\r\nAstor accommodated him, though he at first thought he was running a\r\nconsiderable risk. He was mistaken, for Drew made money and soon\r\nestablished his credit on a solid basis. He bought cattle throughout\r\nOhio, and drove them over the Alleghany mountains. He is said to have\r\nbeen the first drover who attempted this daring experiment. It required\r\nsixty days then to make the journey. He suffered great hardship and\r\nprivation, and would sometimes lose a third part of a drove of 600 or\r\n1,000 in crossing the mountains. Yet, as cattle were very cheap in Ohio,\r\nhis profits were still very large.\r\n\r\nOne terrible night, in a terrific thunderstorm, the tree under which he\r\ntook shelter was shattered to splinters, his horse was killed under him,\r\nand he himself was struck senseless for a time. But no hardship or\r\nprivation could deter him in the pursuit of making money. He afterwards\r\nextended his operations to Kentucky and Illinois.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Drew opened a cattle yard at Twenty-fourth street and Third\r\navenue and ran the Bull’s Head Tavern. He went into the steamboat\r\nbusiness in 1834. Vanderbilt had then been seventeen years in the\r\nbusiness. _Westchester_ and _Emerald_ were the names of his first two\r\nboats, and they ran between New York and Albany, in opposition to the\r\nVanderbilt Line. Drew reduced the fare from three dollars to one, and\r\nattempted to freeze out Vanderbilt. The war of rates became so fierce\r\nthat people were carried 100 miles between these two cities for a\r\nshilling. Drew added the _Knickerbocker_, the _Oregon_, _George Law_,\r\n_Isaac Newton_ and the _New World_ to his river fleet, and became quite\r\na formidable competitor of the Commodore.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Isaac Newton organized the People’s Line on the Hudson, of which\r\nDrew became the largest stockholder. The boats _St. John_, _Dean\r\nRichmond_ and _Drew_ were built. The _Isaac Newton_ was burned and the\r\n_New World_ was sunk.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hudson River Railroad was opened, in 1852, Drew refused to sell\r\nout his stock. “You can regulate your fares as you choose,” he said to\r\nthe President of the Railroad Company, “but the only way you can\r\nregulate my steamboat fares is to buy the People’s Line, and this I\r\ndon’t believe you have money enough to do.” The railroad line merely\r\nstimulated traffic, as the elevated railroads have done in our day, and\r\nDrew was only a gainer instead of a loser by the apparent competition.\r\nHe also controlled the Stonington Line for twenty years.\r\n\r\nDrew made his debut in Wall Street in 1844, just thirteen years prior to\r\nmy first appearance on the boards of this financial theatre, and he was\r\nquite a war horse in speculation when I entered the arena. He formed a\r\npartnership with his son-in-law, a Mr. Kelly, and Nelson Taylor, as\r\nstock brokers and bankers. Their business was large and their credit\r\ngood. The firm continued for ten years, until it was dissolved by the\r\ndeath of his partners. Drew then became one of the most daring and\r\nsuccessful operators in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nDrew was married at the age of 25 to Roxana Mead, a farmer’s daughter,\r\nby whom he was the father of three children, William H., Josephine, who\r\ndied in infancy, and Catharine, who was married to the Rev. W. I. Clapp,\r\na Baptist clergyman, who died and left his widow in good circumstances.\r\nSo there were very little grounds for “Uncle Daniel’s” dread that he\r\nshould probably die in miserable destitution, as it seems that his two\r\nsurviving children were very kind to him. His wife died in 1876.\r\n\r\nDrew was a member of St. Paul’s Methodist Episcopal Church of New York\r\nfor several years. He contributed large sums to various religious and\r\neducational institutions, but like Wilkins Micawber, he usually paid the\r\nmoney in notes, which appeared in the schedule of his liabilities when\r\nhe had lost his large fortune, and had become bankrupt. He founded the\r\nDrew Seminary at Carmel, for young ladies, at a cost of $250,000. He\r\nbuilt the Drew Theological Seminary, at Madison, New Jersey, also at a\r\ncost of $250,000, and endowed it with a similar amount. He only paid the\r\ninterest on the latter. He increased the endowment fund of the Wesleyan\r\nUniversity, at Middletown, Conn., and the Concord Biblical Institute. He\r\nadded $100,000 to the endowment fund of Wesley University, but only paid\r\nthe interest on that also. These appear in the schedule, in the list of\r\nhis unsecured claims. He owned several large grazing farms in Putnam\r\ncounty, but they were heavily mortgaged.\r\n\r\nDrew had some intention of returning to his old home after the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings in 1876, to spend the remainder of his days there\r\namong his grandchildren. This desire shows that there was something\r\ninherently soft and good, after all, in his avaricious nature, and\r\nreminds me of the touching lines of Cowper on the same subject:\r\n\r\n            “Be it a weakness, it deserves some praise,\r\n             We love the play place of our early days,\r\n             The scene is touching, and the heart is stone,\r\n             That feels not at the sight, and feels at none.”\r\n\r\nHe went out to Putnam county in 1876, when he was sick, but he was soon\r\nglad to get back to the city. He said: “I was troubled with visitors,\r\nsome of ’em well on to 100 years old. Some of them said I bought cattle\r\nfrom them when I was young, on credit, and they wanted their bills. I\r\nkept no books, and how was I to know I owed ’em for them critters? It\r\nwas dull outen thar,” he continued, “and yer never can tell till the\r\nnext day how ‘sheers’ is gone.”\r\n\r\nSo Uncle Daniel came back and stopped at the Hoffman House, where he\r\ncould have ready access to the ticker, and kept constantly posted on the\r\nprice of stocks. His principal broker was Mr. David Groesbeck.\r\n\r\nThe city still seemed to have certain fascinations for him that the\r\ncountry was unable to afford. He often spoke regretfully, in his latter\r\ndays, of being too old to retrieve his fortune. He said he longed for\r\nrest. Nothing seemed to weigh more heavily upon his mind than his\r\ninability to carry out the plans connected with his religious\r\nendowments, and he grieved deeply that he had not the means to return to\r\nWall Street that he might have another lucky turn that would enable him\r\nto fulfil these religious obligations according to the original\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nIn the bankruptcy schedule his personal property is itemized as follows:\r\nwatch and chain, $150; sealskin coat, $150; wearing apparel, $100;\r\nBible, hymn books, &c., $130.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was economic in his domestic expenses, he entertained\r\nfriends liberally, and his house at the southwest corner of Seventeenth\r\nstreet and Union Square was always open to Methodist ministers, free of\r\ncharge, from all quarters of the world.\r\n\r\nSome years prior to his death Mr. Drew gave the following candid,\r\nsuccinct and pathetic account of his embarrassment to a journalist who\r\ninterviewed him:\r\n\r\n“I had been wonderfully blest,” said Uncle Daniel, “in money making. I\r\ngot to be a millionaire before I knowed it hardly. I was always pretty\r\nlucky till lately. I didn’t think I could ever lose money extensively. I\r\nwas ambitious of making a great fortune, like Vanderbilt, and I tried\r\nevery way I knew, but got caught at last. Besides that, I liked the\r\nexcitement of making money, and giving it away, and am glad of it. So\r\nmuch has been saved anyhow. Wall Street was a great place for making\r\nmoney, and I could not give up the business when I ought to have done\r\nso. Now, I see very clearly what I ought to have done. I ought to have\r\nleft the Street eight or ten years ago, and paid up what I owed. When I\r\ngave $100,000 to this institution and that, I ought to have paid the\r\nmoney, and I ought to have provided better for my children, by giving\r\nthem enough to make them rich for life. Instead of that I gave my notes,\r\nand only paid the interest on ’em, thinking I could do better with the\r\nprincipal myself. One of the hardest things I have had to bear has been\r\nthe fact that I could not continue to pay the interest on the notes I\r\ngave to the schools and churches.”\r\n\r\n“I gave my son the old homestead,” continued Mr. Drew, “and some other\r\nsmall property up in Putnam, where we came from, which I hope will make\r\nhim independent at least. My daughter married a rich man, and when he\r\ndied, leaving considerable property to five children, I was made\r\nexecutor of the will. For so great a trust as their property I was\r\nobliged to give security, which I did by making over to them this house\r\nwhere we are, and the North River steamboats, the Drew, Dean Richmond,\r\nSt. John and Chauncey Vibbard. This security makes them whole, and I\r\nthank God that breach of trust is not on my conscience. Their mother, my\r\ndaughter, is, of course, well provided for, through her children and\r\ndeceased husband. My son’s principal business is now in connection with\r\nthe management of the boats, by which he is getting on very well.”\r\n\r\nAfter Drew’s great disaster in the Erie “corner,” he became a special\r\npartner in the firm of Kenyon, Cox & Co., and when this house failed,\r\nafter the panic of 1873, Uncle Daniel was compelled to make an\r\nassignment. He had been for years on the losing side, having dropped\r\nbetween two and three millions in the Erie “corner” through the\r\nmachinations of Gould and Fisk. Horace F. Clark and Gould had also\r\ncornered him in Northwestern to the tune of $750,000. After the panic he\r\nhad made an assignment to Wm. L. Scott, of Erie, Pa., but was not\r\nlegally declared a bankrupt until 1876. His liabilities were\r\n$1,074,131.83, and his assets were estimated at $746,499.46.\r\n\r\nLike Vanderbilt, Drew kept his accounts in his head, and considered the\r\nwhole paraphernalia of book-keeping a confounded fraud.\r\n\r\nHis failure, which at one time would have induced a panic, did not cause\r\na ripple on the surface of speculation. After his discharge in the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings, he appeared to pluck up fresh courage, and said,\r\n“The boys think I’m played out, but I’ll give ’em many a turn and twist\r\nyet.” He was interested in Toledo & Wabash, Canada Southern, Quicksilver\r\nMining Company and Canton (Land) Company stock.\r\n\r\nWm. H. Vanderbilt, who had received his early financial training as a\r\nclerk in Drew’s office, still retained a kindly feeling for his old\r\nemployer, and sometimes gave him “pints” as Drew called them, on which\r\nhe made a little turn. It was said that Mr. Vanderbilt had intended to\r\ngive him another start in life about the time Drew passed suddenly over\r\nto the majority. He died at 10.45 P. M., September 18, 1879, at the\r\nresidence of his son, Wm. H. Drew, No. 3 East Forty-second street.\r\n\r\nHis death came without any prior warning. He had been apparently in his\r\nusual health during the day, and had dined with Mr. Darius Lawrence, of\r\nLawrence Brothers, brokers in Broad street, at the Grand Union Hotel, at\r\nsix o’clock in the evening. After dinner he returned to the house of his\r\nson. About nine o’clock he complained of feeling ill, but refused to\r\npermit anybody to sit up with him, saying he would call Mr. Lawrence,\r\nwho slept in an adjacent room, if he should feel worse. About ten\r\no’clock he went into Mr. Lawrence’s apartments and said he felt much\r\nworse. Dr. Woodman, his family physician, was immediately summoned, but\r\nbefore his arrival Mr. Drew had expired. The cause of his death was\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous stories related of Uncle Daniel’s eccentricities, one\r\nis noteworthy in relation to his habit of getting in a mellow mood when\r\nprayer failed to soothe him, and covering himself up in bed after any\r\nspeculative disappointment. He was found in this condition one day at\r\nthe Sturtevant House, the year in which he died, by two Wall Street\r\nacquaintances who called upon him, and were conversant with his peculiar\r\nhabits. He had all the windows closed, so that the atmosphere in the\r\nroom was stifling, and was enveloped in several pairs of double\r\nblankets. His friends called for a bottle of champagne, of which he\r\nrefused to partake. When this was drunk they called for another, and\r\nleft it with him, believing that when he was left alone he might be\r\ninclined to imbibe without any feeling of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nAnother story is related characteristic of Uncle Daniel’s methods of\r\nmaking the best use of a secret, and any confidence that a person might\r\nfoolishly repose in him, in a speculative deal. During the war a young\r\nman known as California Parker, who had more money than brains, began to\r\nbuy Erie in the vicinity of par, and put it up to 120. He went to Drew\r\nand told him that he would let him in at fifteen per cent. below the\r\nmarket, if he would only aid him with a little money to carry the price\r\nhigher. Mr. Drew blandly appeared to entertain the young millionaire’s\r\nproposition favorably and Parker, on the strength of that, continued the\r\nstruggle until he had almost reached the end of his California gold. The\r\nnext morning when he met Drew the latter told him that he was unable to\r\nraise the money, and appeared to be grieved at his disappointment. In\r\nthe meantime Drew had instructed his brokers to sell Erie “short,”\r\nknowing that Parker was unable to absorb any more of that precious\r\npaper, Erie stock. The market went down, Drew made a “scoop,” and Mr.\r\nParker retired from Wall Street a ruined, but a wiser man.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Drew was tall, strong and sinewy, and in his\r\nlatter days his face was seamed with deep lines, indicating intense\r\nthought and worry. He had restless twinkling eyes, with a steady\r\ncat-like tread in his gait. His general demeanor was bland, good-natured\r\nand insinuating, with affected but well dissembled humility, which was\r\nhighly calculated to disarm any resentment, and enable him to move\r\nsmoothly in society among all shades and conditions of men. He has often\r\nbeen mistaken for a country deacon.\r\n\r\nSo, now, having revived and collated the chief incidents in the\r\nchequered career of this great speculative celebrity, I close this\r\nsketch with the ardent hope that he may have found that peace beyond the\r\ntomb which the ordinary speculator in Wall Street can seldom or never\r\nhope to achieve on this side of “that beautiful shore.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  PANICS.—THEIR CAUSES.—HOW FAR PREVENTABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT ACCIDENTAL FREAKS OF THE MARKET.—WE ARE STILL A NATION OF\r\n    PIONEERS.—THE QUESTION OF PANICS PECULIARLY AMERICAN.—VIOLENT\r\n    OSCILLATIONS IN TRADE OWING TO THE GREAT MASS OF NEW AND IMMATURE\r\n    UNDERTAKINGS.—UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF\r\n    PROPERTIES.—SUDDEN SHRINKAGE OF RAILROAD PROPERTIES A FRUITFUL CAUSE\r\n    OF PANICS.—RISKS AND PANICS INSEPARABLE FROM PIONEERING\r\n    ENTERPRISE.—WE ARE BECOMING LESS DEPENDENT ON THE MONEY MARKETS OF\r\n    EUROPE.—IN PANICS MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE PRUDENCE AND SELF-CONTROL OF\r\n    THE MONEY LENDERS.—THE LAW WHICH COMPELS A RESERVE FUND IN THE\r\n    NATIONAL BANKS IS AT CERTAIN CRISES A PROVOCATIVE OF PANICS.—GEORGE\r\n    I. SENEY.—JOHN C. ENO.—FERDINAND WARD.—THE CLEARING HOUSE AS A\r\n    PREVENTIVE OF PANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few subjects on which there is more loose theorizing than that\r\nof the origin and remedy of panics. These crises are commonly spoken of\r\nas accidental freaks of the markets, due to antecedent reckless\r\nspeculations, controlled in their progress by the acts of men and banks\r\nwho have lost their senses, but quite easily prevented, and as easily\r\ncured when they happen.\r\n\r\nThese are the notions of mere surface observers. They may be in a\r\nmeasure true, when applied to the markets of some of the older\r\ncountries, whose business moves in long-established grooves and embraces\r\nbut little of the risk attendant on new enterprises. In France and\r\nGermany, for instance, the hazards of business are almost entirely\r\nconfined to the accidents of political events; and such nations are\r\ncomparatively exempt from panics due to purely commercial causes. In the\r\nUnited States, panics arise, principally, from causes from which\r\nEuropean countries are exempt.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our immense population and the large measure of\r\nwell-ordered consolidation that has been effected in our various\r\ninterests, we are still a nation of pioneers. In every ten years, we now\r\nadd nearly fifteen millions to our population, which means that each\r\nsuccessive decade we are piling up the equivalent of a first-class\r\nEuropean state upon our past marvellous accumulation of empire.\r\nInseparable from this unparalleled national growth are great ventures\r\nand great commercial and financial risks. Our new population has to\r\nsubdue new territory. New lands have to be cleared; new mines have to be\r\nopened; new industries have to be established; new railroads have to be\r\nbuilt; new banks created and new corporations founded. These new\r\nventures are necessarily in a measure experimental. Some of them fail\r\nutterly; others succeed magnificently. They require large outlays of\r\ncapital in advance of obtainable results. These outlays are, in many\r\ncases, met by borrowing; the loans being secured by liens upon the\r\nuncertain undertakings, and therefore lacking the stability of value\r\nthat attaches to well developed investments.\r\n\r\nWe have thus a ceaseless stream of new issues of stocks, mortgages and\r\ncommercial paper, and have, therefore, at all times outstanding a large\r\namount of obligations which, from the uncertainty of their basis, are\r\nliable to wide fluctuations in value. Besides these absolutely new\r\ninvestments, we have also at all times an equal or larger amount of\r\nobligations issued against enterprises which, although not properly new,\r\nare still in an unconsolidated and experimental stage, and the value of\r\nwhich is, therefore, subject to wide fluctuations. Issues of this\r\ncharacter naturally appeal to the adventurous instincts of our people\r\nand elicit a vast extent of speculative activity.\r\n\r\nIt is this peculiarity in the development and trade of the United States\r\nthat renders our markets more exposed to panic than those of any other\r\nnation, and which makes the question of panics a peculiarly American\r\none. In any and every commercial nation, trade is subject to regular\r\nsuccessions of prosperity and depression. This oscillation results from,\r\nor constitutes a natural law.\r\n\r\nThe action of commerce, like the motion of the sea or the atmosphere,\r\nfollows an undulatory line. First comes an ascending wave of activity\r\nand rising prices; next, when prices have risen to a point that checks\r\ndemand, comes a period of hesitation and caution; then, care among\r\nlenders and discounters; then comes the descending movement, in which\r\nholders simultaneously endeavor to realize, thereby accelerating a\r\ngeneral fall in prices. Credit then becomes more sensitive and is\r\ncontracted; transactions are diminished; losses are incurred through the\r\ndepreciation of property, and finally the ordeal becomes so severe to\r\nthe debtor class that forcible liquidation has to be adopted, and\r\ninsolvent firms and institutions must be wound up. This process is a\r\nperiodical experience in every country; and the extent of the\r\ndestructiveness of the crisis that attends it depends chiefly on the\r\nsteadiness and conservatism of the business methods in each particular\r\ncommunity affected. In addition to this ordinary and, I would even say,\r\n_natural_ liability to commercial crises with a greater or lesser degree\r\nof panic, we, in the United States, have to stand the far more violent\r\noscillations so inseparable from our great mass of new and immature\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nIn times of crisis, the obligations issued against such enterprises\r\nsuffer instantly from the uncertainty about their intrinsic value.\r\nHolders are anxious to get rid of them; banks which have advanced money\r\non them, call in their advances; and they become virtually unavailable\r\nassets. Every panic that has happened since the beginning of the era of\r\nrailroads in this country, has been intensified many-fold by the sudden\r\nshrinkage in the value of this class of assets; and it is precisely here\r\nthat the aggravation and the chief danger of an American panic centres.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, what is the use of discussing the possibility of\r\naverting our periodic panics? Risks and panics are inseparable from our\r\nvast pioneering enterprise; and all we can hope is, that they may\r\ndiminish in severity in proportion as our older and more consolidated\r\ninterests afford an increasing power of resistance to their operation. I\r\nam disposed to think that, in the future, the counteraction from this\r\nsource will be much more effective than it has been in the past. The\r\naccumulations of financial resource available for market purposes at our\r\nmonetary centres are increasing at a very rapid rate. Evidence of this\r\nis seen in the fact that, while the magnitude of our corporate\r\nundertakings is augmenting every year, we are also every year becoming\r\nless dependent on the money markets of Europe, and our large corporate\r\nloans are now made principally at home. These accumulations afford\r\nelasticity to our financial system and serve as a buffer against the\r\nviolence of great financial disturbances.\r\n\r\nI do not see how we can in any other way satisfactorily explain how it\r\nis that, while we have had two distinct waves of commercial depression\r\nsince the great crisis of 1873, such as have ordinarily been attended\r\nwith more or less panic, we have had no disturbance that can be regarded\r\nas a fully developed panic. The only approach to it was the disturbance\r\nbrought about by the Grant & Ward failure in May, 1884, which was merely\r\na restricted and comparatively temporary affair.\r\n\r\nBut, whilst maintaining that panics cannot be avoided in a country\r\nsituated as ours is in its present incomplete development, I cannot\r\navoid expressing the opinion that conditions are permitted to exist\r\nwhich needlessly aggravate the perils of these upheavals when they do\r\noccur. In every panic very much depends upon the prudence and\r\nself-control of the money lenders. If they lose their heads and\r\nindiscriminately refuse to lend, or lend only to the few unquestionably\r\nstrong borrowers, the worst forms of panic ensue; if they accommodate to\r\ntheir fullest ability the larger and reasonably safe class of borrowers,\r\nthen the latter may be relied upon to protect those whom the banks\r\nreject, and thus the mischief may be kept within legitimate bounds.\r\nEverything depends upon rashness being held in check by an assurance\r\nthat deserving debtors will be protected. This is tantamount to saying\r\nthat all depends on the calmness and wisdom of the banks. They may\r\neasily mitigate or aggravate the severity of the crisis, according as\r\nthey are prudently liberal or blindly selfish. It is, perhaps, safe to\r\nsay, that the banks never do all they may; but the banks of this city\r\nmust be credited with having shown great sagacity under repeated\r\nderangements of this kind within the last twenty-five years. They have\r\nlargely succeeded in combining self-protection with the protection of\r\ntheir customers; and the antecedents they have established will go far\r\ntoward breaking the force of any future panic.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the law imposes restraints upon the national banks\r\nwhich seriously interfere with the wise discretion of those\r\ninstitutions. As the law now stands, the banks are liable to be wound up\r\nat the order of the Government if they permit their lawful money\r\nreserves to fall below 26 per cent. of their legal deposits. This\r\nestablishes a “dead line” which is so dreaded when approached that it\r\nbecomes almost a panic line. When that limit is reached, the banks are\r\ncompelled to contract their loans; and, in certain conditions, the\r\ncontraction of loans means forcible liquidation, without regard to\r\nconsequences. Thus the very contrivance designed to protect the banks\r\nbecomes a source of most serious danger to their customers and therefore\r\nto the banks themselves; and, in times of monetary pressure, it is the\r\nmost direct provocative of panic. Were the banks allowed to use their\r\nreserves under such circumstances, a fund would be provided for\r\nmitigating the force of the crisis, and the danger might be gradually\r\ntided over; but, as it is, the banks can legally do little or nothing to\r\navert panic; on the contrary, the law compels them to take a course\r\nwhich precipitates it; and when the crash has come, they have to unite\r\nin common cause to disregard the law and do what they can to repair the\r\ncatastrophe that a preposterous enactment has helped to bring about.\r\nThis is one of not a few unwise restrictions upon our national banks\r\nwhich needs to be stricken from the statute book. These periods of the\r\nbreaking-down of unsound enterprises and of the weeding out of insolvent\r\ndebtors and of liquidation of bad debts can never be wholly averted; nor\r\nis it desirable that they should, for they are essential to the\r\nmaintenance of a sound and wholesome condition of business; but it is a\r\ngrave reproach to our legislators if, when the day of purgation comes,\r\nthe law treats the deserving and the undeserving with equal severity.\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE I. SENEY.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent characters in the short lived panic of 1884, as every\r\nobserving person knows, were Ferdinand Ward, James D. Fish and a few\r\nothers who acted minor parts in connection with the methods of\r\nfinanciering which precipitated the crisis in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who think that Ward—the Young Napoleon of finance,\r\nas he was popularly called—was able to dupe everybody, his accomplices\r\nincluded, and that he was chiefly responsible for all the trouble. But\r\nthis is an exaggerated and unscientific view of the case.\r\n\r\nAmong the financiers who came to grief in the general embarrassment\r\ncaused by the peculiar methods of the two financiers referred to, was\r\nGeorge I. Seney. Seney gave his money away, and it was placed in the\r\nwrong quarters for any tangible return. He was a great patron of the\r\nchurches and religious institutions. If he had studied the life of\r\nDaniel Drew, he might have discovered that investments in such\r\nenterprises as these were not particularly profitable. In his financial\r\ndifficulties, Seney was left high and dry without friends who would come\r\nto his rescue. The result was, that the two financial institutions, the\r\nMetropolitan Bank and the Brooklyn bank with which he was thoroughly\r\nidentified, had to go under as the result of Mr. Seney’s misfortunes.\r\nAnd an insurance company in Brooklyn, which had loaned about all of its\r\nsurplus to Mr. Seney, taking Metropolitan Bank stock as collateral, was\r\nswamped as well.\r\n\r\nThere are few of the speculative magnates who succumbed to the crash of\r\n1884, whose financial histories are more interesting than that of Mr.\r\nSeney. He is the son of a Methodist minister, and was born at Astoria,\r\nLong Island, about sixty years ago. He has always manifested the deepest\r\ndevotion to his paternal church, and in the very height of his\r\nprosperity the church was the first object of his financial care. He was\r\neducated at the University of the City of New York, and shortly after he\r\ngraduated, and when about 22 years of age, entered the Metropolitan Bank\r\nas a clerk. He was afterwards teller and then cashier. This was when Mr.\r\nWilliams was President and when Mr. Jacques was Vice-President. Mr.\r\nJacques resigned that position several years ago and made a prolonged\r\njourney to Europe. Mr. Williams died a few years ago, and Mr. Seney\r\nbecame his successor as President of the bank.\r\n\r\nMr. Seney’s wonderful financial abilities were a comparatively recent\r\noutgrowth of his mental evolution, at an age when very few men exhibit\r\nsigns of new developments.\r\n\r\nUp to a date shortly prior to the panic, he was generally regarded as\r\nslow and phlegmatic, without manifesting any special parts that\r\nindicated superior brilliancy as a financier. He first distinguished\r\nhimself in Wall Street during the speculative furore of 1879, and came\r\nto the front then with sudden and surprising activity. He carved out an\r\noriginal course for himself in speculation—so original, in fact, as to\r\nstamp the enterprises with which he became identified with his name. The\r\nSeney properties became almost as familiar to the financial world as the\r\nGoulds, the Vanderbilts and the Villards.\r\n\r\nMr. Seney’s chief securities (so-called through the courtesy of\r\nspeculative parlance) were Ohio Central, Rochester and Pittsburgh, East\r\nTennessee, Virginia & Georgia, and the celebrated “Nickel Plate” Road.\r\nThese were known as the Seney Syndicate properties, and the system of\r\nhandling them was entirely novel in the history of Wall Street, causing\r\nthe financial veterans of Wall Street to stand and stare at the boldness\r\nand rapidity of the Seney movements.\r\n\r\nInstead of starting with moderate issues in amount, as has usually been\r\nthe custom of most men handling railroad and telegraph properties, and\r\ndoing the watering process by degrees, Mr. Seney boldly began the\r\nwatering at the very inception of the enterprise, pouring it in lavishly\r\nand without stint. There was nothing mean or niggardly about his method\r\nof free dilution, the sight of which threw some of the old operators\r\ninto a fit of consternation. The stocks were strongly puffed, and as\r\nthey were so thoroughly diluted their owners could afford to let them\r\nget a start at a very low figure. The future prospects of the properties\r\nwere set forth in the most glowing colors, the public took the bait, and\r\nthe stocks became at once conspicuous among the leading active fancies\r\nof the market.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the vigorous life and amazing activity so suddenly imparted\r\nto the stocks of the Seney Syndicate can only be revealed by a careful\r\nperusal of Mr. Seney’s checkbook, which, if still in existence, will\r\nshow commissions paid for the execution of the orders to buy and the\r\norders executed to sell, both by the same pen and in the same\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nThese transactions, in the language of the “Street,” are called washed\r\nsales. In this way Mr. Seney was understood to have made a very large\r\namount of money, and from being almost one of the poorest men in\r\nBrooklyn, he soon became marked as the richest. While he continued to\r\nthrive it was a singular fact that the majority of his financial friends\r\nseemed to fall into a decline.\r\n\r\nWhen the affairs of the Seney enterprise were wound up, it was\r\ndiscovered that these people had little left except the certificates\r\nwhich bore the high-sounding term of the Seney Syndicate Property.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity about Mr. Seney in his social relations was, that while\r\nhe appeared almost bereft of sympathy for used-up friends whom his\r\nschemes had ruined, he drew largely on his immense gains for\r\nphilanthropic purposes, and in the aggregate must have distributed over\r\n$2,000,000 in a very magnanimous manner.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Mr. Seney at one time aspired to be a great\r\nphilanthropist, and had it not been for the unfortunate exposé which was\r\nthe result of the panic, he might one day have stood in as high and\r\nlordly a position as the renowned Peabody, with even a greater\r\nreputation as a financier. It is sad to picture the contrast presented\r\nby the _denouement_ with what might have been, in a career which began\r\nwith so much promise, dating from the time that Mr. Seney was installed\r\nas President of the Metropolitan Bank, whose standing and credit were\r\nthe highest in the State.\r\n\r\nMr. Seney’s speculative career affords an example of the way in which\r\nthis kind of speculation reflects on the stability of our best banking\r\ninstitutions. The lesson is one that should be carefully taken to heart\r\nby the financiers of this country.\r\n\r\nIt is due, however, to Mr. Seney to state that he alone was not\r\nresponsible for the misfortunes of the Metropolitan Bank, although he\r\nwas the ruling spirit; for it could hardly be possible that the\r\ndirectors of that institution could have been ignorant of its affairs in\r\nconnection with the Seney speculations. The Metropolitan Bank cannot be\r\ncompared with the Marine Bank, which met a similar misfortune, for it\r\nwas no family affair, and Mr. Seney had none of his relatives connected\r\nwith it, as Mr. Fish had with the Marine Bank.\r\n\r\nIt appears that it was chiefly owing to the fact that Mr. Seney had so\r\nlittle personal interest in the Metropolitan Bank that he was so anxious\r\nto gut the concern, knowing that the loss would fall upon others.\r\n\r\nThe most important point for speculators and investors, however,\r\nconnected with the enterprises of these men is, that the terrible\r\nshrinkage of Stock Exchange values at the time, amounting to over\r\n$1,000,000,000, was in a large measure brought about by a foregone\r\nconclusion on the part of the sagacious bear cliques that disaster would\r\nsooner or later overtake the institutions over which Mr. Seney and Mr.\r\nFish presided.\r\n\r\nThis should afford a wholesome lesson, through the medium of practical\r\nexperience, to speculators and investors for all future time. For this\r\nvery reason the facts are worthy of being put on permanent record as a\r\nreminder and a guide, particularly to Wall Street men, who are too often\r\nprone to forget the past and thus leave themselves liable to be caught\r\nin a similar net again.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the four prominent speculators who played the most\r\nconspicuous part in the events which resulted in the panic of May, 1884,\r\nshould be preserved for reference, as a guide when similar cases arise,\r\nfor in spite of the deep disgrace, shame and misery that have followed\r\nin the wake of their enterprises, these men will have hosts of imitators\r\nfor many years to come. Ward, Fish, Seney and Eno, with probably the one\r\nexception, Fish, are, by many, considered smart men, who simply had the\r\nmisfortune to become involved, but who had a fair chance of coming out\r\nof all their troubles, great millionaires and publicly honored for their\r\nability and success.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that there are some examples in the financial world\r\nwhose careers will fully support this theory and belief but they are the\r\nexceptions which only prove the rule in speculation, as in other lines\r\nof business, that “honesty is the best policy.” These men, who have been\r\napparently so successful through dishonest methods, are never free from\r\ndread of being tripped up at any period of their inflated prosperity.\r\nThey are always subject to be called upon by the application of the\r\nstern methods of honest financiering to give an account of their\r\nstewardship, and to have the transactions of a lifetime eventually\r\ngauged by the standard of public honesty. It is the winding up that\r\ntells the tale, and exposes the duplicity of the ablest financiers, who\r\nvainly imagine that dishonest methods will always prevail.\r\n\r\n                              JOHN C. ENO.\r\n\r\nOf the four famous “financiers” mentioned who were most prominent in the\r\nSummer panic of 1884, the speculative history of John C. Eno was in some\r\nrespects the most remarkable and most interesting.\r\n\r\nEno was a young man, not more than twenty-six years of age, and a\r\nrepresentative of that class of ardent and youthful speculators who\r\nplunge into the market with all the recklessness incident to young and\r\nsanguine imaginations, with many roseate schemes of wealth and\r\ngreatness, for which inexperienced youth is proverbial. Eno was a victim\r\nof that rashness, impulsiveness and desire for extravagance, by which\r\nthe possessors of these attributes frequently get themselves and many of\r\ntheir associates embroiled in numerous difficulties and embarrassments.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest in the curious career of Eno was his position\r\nas President of the Second National Bank of New York, up to the time of\r\nthe panic. Seldom does it fall to the lot of a youth of his tender years\r\nto have conferred upon him a position of such responsibility and\r\ndignity. The manner in which he made use of this position of trust, for\r\nappropriating money which did not belong to him, was notable for its\r\npeculiar ingenuity.\r\n\r\nMost of the money lent by the bank was upon collateral securities,\r\nwhich, for convenience, as well as for safety, were kept, not at the\r\nbank, which was situated under the Fifth Avenue Hotel, but in a vault\r\ndown town.\r\n\r\nThe capital stock of the bank was $100,000, and it had $4,000,000 of\r\ndeposits, all of which was appropriated to speculative use by this smart\r\nyoung man, who decamped to Canada in company with a Roman Catholic\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nEno happened to have a rich father, who had made his money by thrift and\r\neconomy during a long and prosperous life. To his credit, it must be\r\nsaid, that he came promptly to the rescue of this wayward and erring\r\nson, and paid the bank, of which he was director, three and one-half\r\nmillions of dollars, on condition that the other half million should be\r\ncontributed by the other directors, all of whom were very rich men. The\r\ndirectors willingly accepted the proposition, and thus the entire\r\ndeficiency was made good by this generous arrangement, so that none of\r\nthe depositors suffered the loss of a dollar.\r\n\r\nThe methods which Mr. John C. Eno, the President, resorted to for the\r\npurpose of capturing the institution root and branch, were ingenious and\r\nunique in their character, inasmuch as they had a tendency to inspire\r\nthe fullest confidence in his vigilance and honesty regarding the\r\naffairs of the bank, instead of exciting any suspicion.\r\n\r\nHe discouraged the custom of keeping the securities of the bank in its\r\nown vaults, on the pretense that they were not sufficiently secure, and\r\nsuggested that a safe should be rented in one of the down town safe\r\ndeposit companies. This was done at his request. He argued, further,\r\nthat the funds on hand being mostly family deposits, the depositors were\r\nnot of a class that often required to be accommodated with discounts,\r\nand that the money was not taken by the bank to be locked up and kept on\r\nhand so as to have the name of having it, but to be used to the best\r\npossible advantage consistent with safety, to make profitable returns\r\nthrough interest. Consequently, he was allowed to use the money of the\r\nbank freely to make loans to Wall Street brokers on interest, with\r\napproved collaterals, and he represented to the directors that he was\r\ncarrying out this course.\r\n\r\nAs the bank was located so far up town, (at Twenty-third street,) the\r\ndistance from Wall Street made it extra hazardous to send securities\r\nback and forth, as adventurous thieves might seize the messenger on the\r\nway. This has frequently happened in this city. It was, therefore,\r\ndesirable to have the safe deposit vault in close proximity to Wall\r\nStreet. Of the combination to the safe in this vault Mr. John C. Eno was\r\nthe sole possessor. Having things fixed in this manner it was\r\nindispensable that the President himself should go down town every day,\r\nso as to accommodate the brokers in the loaning of money. The directors\r\nwere by this plan convinced that the risks, through the careful methods\r\nadopted by the President, were no greater than if the bank was located\r\nin Wall Street. These conservative methods, so skilfully planned and\r\nplausibly explained, increased the confidence of the directors in the\r\nable and careful management of Mr. Eno, and nobody was so much surprised\r\nas they, when the wool was raised from their eyes and they discovered\r\nthat these various and ostensible “safeguards” were ingeniously devised\r\nfor the sole purpose of screening their skilful inventor in the\r\naccomplishment of his huge defalcations.\r\n\r\nInstead of loaning the money to Wall Street brokers, as he represented\r\nto the directors, he placed it as margin with his own brokers in various\r\nspeculative ventures, and in that manner he made away with the entire\r\n$4,000,000 of the bank’s deposits without exciting the least suspicion\r\nin the confiding breasts of the directors.\r\n\r\nSuch another instance of a clean sweep of the deposits of a bank by any\r\nof its officials, is probably not on record in the whole history of this\r\nkind of manipulation.\r\n\r\nWhen the President represented to the Cashier, every evening, that he\r\nhad lent specified sums on certain securities, his word was taken, and\r\nhis checks for the amounts duly honored, without exciting a feeling of\r\nsuspicion. Thus, by degrees the books of the bank showed $4,000,000 of\r\ncall loans upon unexceptionable collaterals, when in fact the money had\r\nall gone to the President’s private account.\r\n\r\nEno speculated with the greater portion of the money in stocks that were\r\ncontinually declining in price, and at length the time arrived when he\r\nwas obliged to make a clean breast of the terrible condition of his\r\naffairs to his father. As I have stated, the old gentleman, Mr. Amos R.\r\nEno, nobly came to the relief of his prodigal son, and saved the bank\r\nfrom suspension.\r\n\r\nAs Eno senior is still worth about $25,000,000, he will never suffer the\r\npangs of poverty through this great loss; but it will take a long time\r\nto enable him to survive the disgrace which the flagrant acts of his son\r\nhave brought upon an honest and highly respected name.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE CLEARING-HOUSE AS A PREVENTER OF PANICS.\r\n\r\nIn this panic the boldest and most remarkable instance of self-sacrifice\r\non record was manifested by the Clearing-House banks. The panic of 1884,\r\nin its incipient stage, was different to any that had preceded it—at\r\nleast any of the financial convulsions within my recollection—owing to\r\nthe influence exercised upon it by the prompt and liberal policy of the\r\nbanks. In every respect their action was notable, showing that those at\r\nthe head of their management had largely profited by the lessons of\r\nformer panics.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly due to the masterly management of the banks, together\r\nwith the magnanimous conduct of Mr. Amos R. Eno and his associate\r\ndirectors of the Second National Bank, that the panic was short-lived\r\nand so narrowly circumscribed. Had it not been for the determinate and\r\ninstantaneous joint action of these parties there would have been a very\r\nserious crash, which would have been far-reaching in its results.\r\n\r\nThe results of the timely action taken on the part of the managers of\r\nthese institutions in this crisis, proves that panics can be arrested by\r\nproper methods, and that quick and determined action is indispensable in\r\nthe incipient stage of the emergency. If bank presidents could only be\r\nrelied upon by the business community to act promptly and in unison with\r\nthe business men, as they did in this instance, threatened panics need\r\nhave but little terror for the people, who now live constantly in dread\r\nthat these outbursts of business disaster may be sprung upon them at any\r\ntime in any decade.\r\n\r\nIn the past history of panics bank managers, as a rule, have acted\r\nwithout system, without judgment and almost entirely without any well\r\ndefined plan of action. There has been an astonishing lack of vigor in\r\ntheir methods and purposes, which were weak and vacillating in their\r\ncharacter—frequently more like the acts of children than those of\r\nbusiness men.\r\n\r\nIf the panic of 1873 had received the same vigorous treatment in its\r\norigin as that of 1884, it could just as easily have been checked as the\r\nlatter, and the entire country would have been saved a large portion of\r\nthe depressing effects of that serious collapse and its attendant\r\ndisasters, which caused a state of general prostration for five or six\r\nyears succeeding the event. These years, from a business standpoint,\r\nappear as a blank in the history of the country’s progress. Indeed, they\r\nconstitute a black mark.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the bears indulged in much adverse criticism in regard to the\r\naction of the Clearing-House in taking Mr. Seney’s pictures as\r\ncollateral. At the time, this method of financiering was without\r\nprecedent; but the result has fully justified the policy of the\r\nClearing-House Association and its management. Such an exceptionally\r\nfine collection of paintings in a country like this, now filled with\r\nconnoisseurs who have sufficient wealth to gratify their tastes,\r\nstimulates the demand for these luxurious articles of value and\r\ntransforms them into the best collateral to be found in the market. When\r\nthe Seney pictures were offered for sale at auction they attracted\r\ngreater competition in the purchase, at good prices, than could have\r\nbeen obtained for almost any class of railroad securities connected with\r\nWall Street for months afterwards. While Mr. Seney seems to have been as\r\nmuch of a virtuoso as the late Mrs. Morgan, he did not permit his love\r\nof the beautiful to rise to such a pitch of exaltation as would cause\r\nhim to pay the extravagant prices which almost ruined that eccentric\r\nwoman. He never forgot that the picture had a “market” value, and never\r\npermitted his enthusiasm for the fine arts to make him a victim of sharp\r\nand unconscionable dealers. In fact he appeared to have been more\r\nwide-awake in picture buying than banking, and demonstrated that the\r\nformer, rather than the latter, was his forte. If the bank presidents\r\nhad not acted in the praiseworthy manner referred to, the financial\r\nrevulsion of that panic would have been very serious. Several millions\r\nof deposits in the Metropolitan and Second National were promptly drawn\r\nout, and forthwith entered into circulation. This saved the community\r\nfrom the evil influence of a large number of panic makers in the persons\r\nof the depositors of these banks. Instead, therefore, of helping to stir\r\nup the excitement—as they would have done by pursuing the selfish policy\r\nformerly resorted to in similar circumstances—every person with funds in\r\nthese two institutions, assisted very effectively to allay suspicion and\r\ncreate confidence, instead of distrust.\r\n\r\nIt was the disturbing element of panic makers, who generally constitute\r\none of the most potent factors of disruption to be dealt with in seasons\r\nof business trouble, that caused the greater part of the trouble at the\r\ntime of Jay Cooke’s failure. The holders of the Northern Pacific bonds\r\nthen, finding that the security was no longer equal to that of\r\nGovernment bonds (as they had been taught to believe), but was\r\napparently worthless, became panic-stricken at their losses, and were\r\nall transformed into panic-makers, infusing the spirit of distrust into\r\nevery person with whom they came into contact, until, like a fatal\r\nvirus, it inoculated the whole country, spreading business disaster far\r\nand wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _G.

Seney_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n               OLD TIME PANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PANIC OF 1837.—HOW IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT.—THE STATE BANKS.—HOW THEY\r\n    EXPANDED THEIR LOANS UNDER GOVERNMENT PATRONAGE.—SPECULATION WAS\r\n    STIMULATED AND VALUES BECAME INFLATED.—PRESIDENT JACKSON’S “SPECIE\r\n    CIRCULAR” PRECIPITATES THE PANIC.—BANK CONTRACTIONS AND CONSEQUENT\r\n    FAILURES.—MIXING UP BUSINESS AND POLITICS.—A GENERAL COLLAPSE, WITH\r\n    INTENSE SUFFERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first panic of any great importance was that of 1837. This panic had\r\nits origin in a misunderstanding between the United States Bank, with\r\nheadquarters located at Philadelphia, and President Jackson, whose\r\nelection the officials of the bank had opposed.\r\n\r\nThe bank had been chartered in 1816, and went into operation in 1817.\r\nIts charter had twenty years to run. The bank had been kept in operation\r\nwith varying success until 1830, when it was considered to be on a very\r\nstable footing, so that the Finance Committee of the United States\r\nSenate were enabled to testify to its efficiency as follows: “We are\r\nsatisfied that the country is in the enjoyment of a uniform national\r\ncurrency, not only sound and uniform in itself, but perfectly adapted to\r\nthe purposes of the Government and the community, and more sound and\r\nuniform than that possessed by any other nation.”\r\n\r\nThis was the second United States Bank; the first had been chartered in\r\n1791.\r\n\r\nThe bank applied to Congress, in 1832, for a renewal of its charter,\r\nwhich would expire in 1836. A bill was passed by Congress to re-charter\r\nthe bank. The bill was vetoed by the President for the reason above\r\nstated. In the following year the Treasurer announced, by order of the\r\nPresident, that the public funds, amounting to $10,000,000, would be\r\ndrawn from the custody of the bank because it was an unsafe depository.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the Government funds to the State banks created great\r\nagitation in political and financial circles. The State banks, under\r\nthis favorable turn of Government patronage, quickly assumed a thriving\r\ncondition and began to expand their loans and circulation. This\r\nstimulated speculation in all parts of the country, but especially land\r\nspeculation. Large purchases of land were made from the Government, and\r\npayment was made in notes of State banks.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid sales of its lands the Government was soon able to pay\r\noff the public debt, and had still a surplus of $50,000,000 in the\r\nTreasury. This apparent prosperity continued for the next year or two,\r\nmoney was plenty and speculation was greatly stimulated and values\r\nbecame inflated.\r\n\r\nThe crisis came in 1837, and was hastened by the “Specie Circular,”\r\nwhich was the last official act of President Jackson, and which pricked\r\nthe bubble of inflation. This circular, which was issued from the\r\nTreasury in July, 1836, required all collectors of the public revenue to\r\nreceive nothing but gold and silver in payment. The purpose of the\r\ncircular was to check the speculation in public lands, but it caused too\r\nsudden a contraction in values, and created widespread disturbance in\r\nbusiness circles generally.\r\n\r\nThe public protest against the “Specie Circular” was so strong and\r\nuniversal, that a bill went through both houses of Congress partially\r\nrepealing it. “Old Hickory” did not yield to Congress, however, and\r\nthough he did not veto the bill, he delayed signing it until after\r\nCongress adjourned, thus preventing it from becoming a law.\r\n\r\nThe State banks sought to tide over the troubles arising from the\r\nJacksonian method of financiering by loans of public money to certain\r\nfinancial concerns and individuals, but this plan only made matters\r\nworse. There was a sudden expansion of paper money, which encouraged a\r\nwild spirit of speculation and excessive importations, and imparted an\r\nunnatural stimulus to business and commercial affairs. This state of\r\nover-trading and reckless speculation was suddenly checked by bank\r\ncontractions, and in the spring of 1837 there were failures amounting to\r\n$100,000,000 in New York city alone.\r\n\r\nThe shock was communicated to the entire country, and a state of general\r\nparalysis in business circles ensued.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Bank of the United States continued in operation,\r\nand did not even suspend in 1836, when its charter expired, but obtained\r\nanother charter from the State of Pennsylvania, which was entitled “An\r\nAct to repeal the State taxes on real and personal property, and to\r\ncontinue and extend the improvement of the State by railroads and\r\ncanals, and to charter a State bank to be called a United States bank.”\r\n\r\nThis United States bank did not expire until 1839, though it suspended\r\nspecie payment with the State banks in 1837, when by this method they\r\nescaped a general collapse, and dragged through an agonising existence\r\nfor two years longer. The circulating notes and deposits of the Bank of\r\nthe United States were paid in full, but the $28,000,000 of capital were\r\na total loss to the stockholders, who never obtained a dividend. Such\r\nwere the good old times of financiering when General Jackson and his\r\nsuccessor, Martin Van Buren, sat in the Executive chair.\r\n\r\nThe entire capital stock of the bank was $35,000,000, of which\r\n$7,000,000 were to be subscribed by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe real cause at the bottom of the failure of this bank was its error\r\nof mixing up its legitimate business of banking with politics and\r\nspeculation, showing that keeping those matters as distinct as possible\r\nis one of the great secrets of success in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1837 was further aggravated by the action of the Bank of\r\nEngland which, in one day, threw out all the paper connected with the\r\nUnited States. The banks on this side refused to discount paper, and as\r\na retaliatory measure in self-defense the business men and speculators\r\nwithdrew their deposits from the banks. This had a tendency to cripple\r\nbusiness still more, and cause utter prostration. In their selfish\r\nfrenzy bankers and merchants completed the ruin of each other, hastening\r\nthe catastrophe from their inability to take a broad, cool and generous\r\nview of the situation.\r\n\r\nThere was a general suspension of the New York banks on May 10, 1837,\r\nand the banks throughout the country followed in their wake within a\r\nweek afterwards, producing a financial convulsion unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of the Republic. The country was brought to the verge of\r\nbankruptcy from the effects of which a long time was required for\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nAfter two years’ struggle to regain the credit and stability lost\r\nthrough false methods of financiering, the banks suffered a relapse, and\r\nunderwent a severe process of weeding out the weakest, nearly one-third\r\nof which happened to be of this description. Out of 850 banks, 343\r\nclosed their doors permanently.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Treasury at New York was established the following year, 1840,\r\nby an act of Congress which provided that the officers of the Government\r\nshould keep the public funds in their own custody, that coin alone\r\nshould be received in payment to the United States, and bank notes were\r\nto be no longer received and paid out at the Treasury.\r\n\r\nWhile this short chapter deals with matters which go back beyond my\r\npersonal recollections of twenty-eight years in Wall Street, still as\r\nthe panic of 1837 was the first of the great upheavals of its kind, that\r\nhad a marked effect on Wall Street affairs, it properly falls within the\r\nscope of this book to chronicle the chief incidents of that great\r\nbusiness convulsion.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, therefore, I find room for it, in some measure\r\ncommensurate with its importance, and the space which can be afforded to\r\nit, as a matter of financial history, the facts of which were still\r\nfresh in the recollection of several speculators, bankers and business\r\nmen, with whom I had the honor of being acquainted shortly after my\r\nadvent in Wall Street immediately succeeding the panic of 1857.\r\n\r\nOf those who gave me lively descriptions of their vivid recollections of\r\nthat panic, but few now survive.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, it is well for me to do my part in helping to\r\npreserve the leading features of this important episode in the early\r\nhistory of Wall Street, as there will soon be none of those, who took an\r\nactive part in the exciting events of that period, left to tell the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n        THE TRUE STORY OF BLACK FRIDAY TOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BLACK FRIDAY SCHEME ORIGINATES IN PATRIOTIC MOTIVES.—ADVISING\r\n    BOUTWELL AND GRANT TO SELL GOLD.—THE PART JIM FISK PLAYED IN THE\r\n    SPECULATIVE DRAMA.-“GONE WHERE THE WOODBINE TWINETH.”—A GENERAL\r\n    STATE OF CHAOS IN WALL STREET.—HOW THE ISRAELITE FAINTED.-“WHAT ISH\r\n    THE PRISH NOW?”—GOULD THE HEAD CENTRE OF THE PLOT TO “CORNER”\r\n    GOLD.—HOW HE MANAGED TO DRAW AMPLE MEANS FROM ERIE.—GOULD AND FISK\r\n    ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE PRESIDENT GRANT AND COMPROMISE HIM AND HIS\r\n    FAMILY IN THE PLOT.—SCENES AND INCIDENTS OF THE GREAT SPECULATIVE\r\n    DRAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1869 this country was blessed with abundant crops, far in\r\nexcess of our needs, and it was apparent that great good would result\r\nfrom any method that could be devised to stimulate exports of a part, at\r\nleast, of the surplus.\r\n\r\nLetters poured into Washington by the thousand from leading bankers,\r\nmerchants and business men, urging that the Treasury Department abstain\r\nfrom selling gold, as had been the practice for some time, so that the\r\npremium might, as it otherwise would not, advance to a figure that would\r\nsend our products out of the country, as the cheapest exportable\r\nmaterial in place of coin, which, at its then artificially depressed\r\nprice, was the cheapest of our products, and at the same time the only\r\none undesirable to part with. So the Government decided to suspend gold\r\nsales indefinitely.\r\n\r\nJay Gould and others, being satisfied that this was to be the policy of\r\nthe Administration, commenced at once buying large amounts of gold,\r\nactuated, doubtless, by the purest of patriotic motives, namely, to\r\nstimulate cotton and cereal exports. They succeeded in accumulating a\r\nconsiderable amount of gold at prices ranging from 135 to 140, covering\r\na period of three months’ steady buying.\r\n\r\nThis was the honest foundation on which the great Black Friday\r\nspeculative deal was erected.\r\n\r\nThe eruption on Black Friday was really caused by the erratic conduct of\r\nJames Fisk, Jr., who actively joined the movement on Thursday, the day\r\nbefore, and became wild with enthusiasm on the subject of high gold. He\r\nbegan on Friday, early in the morning, to buy large blocks through his\r\nown brokers, William Belden and Albert Speyer, running the price up very\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe original syndicate consisted of Jay Gould, Arthur Kimber,\r\nrepresenting Stern Brothers, of London, and W. S. Woodward, of Rock\r\nIsland corner notoriety. The two latter, however, sold out their\r\ninterest to Gould, who directed the deal to the end, with the assistance\r\nof several able and wicked partners. Their office was located in Broad\r\nstreet, on the present site of the Drexel Building.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement arising from the above causes was at its height, I\r\nsent a telegram to Secretary Boutwell, and one to President Grant,\r\nrepresenting the exact condition of affairs in Wall Street, and urging\r\nthe sale of gold without delay. I also prevailed upon General\r\nButterfield, the New York Sub Treasurer, and Moses H. Grinnell, the\r\nCollector of the Port, to send similar telegrams, which they did, and\r\ntimely action was taken at once by an order coming to sell $5,000,000.\r\nThe moral effect of this Government action was to strike terror to the\r\nholders of gold, and a general rush was made to sell out, thereby\r\ndriving down the premium from 160, in less than two hours, to 132. The\r\ndown grade produced an excitement quite equal to the early furore in the\r\nup movement. Albert Speyer had from Fisk a verbal _carte blanche_ order\r\nto buy, in million lots, all the gold he could get at 160; while he was\r\nthus buying millions upon millions at this figure, on the opposite side,\r\nand in other sections of the room, sales were freely made in moderate\r\namounts at 140, 145, 147 and 150, almost simultaneously; and even when\r\n135 was reached, which was soon thereafter, Speyer still kept on bidding\r\n160 for a million at a time, making one of the wildest and most\r\nludicrous spectacles ever witnessed among men not idiots. Fisk\r\nafterwards repudiated the contracts made on his account by Speyer &\r\nBelden, simply denying having given the orders, and as they were not in\r\nwriting, they could not well be proven, hence both brokers failed,\r\nthrowing immense losses upon an innumerable number of others. Quite a\r\nnoted firm sold Speyer some of his million lots, which they bought back\r\nat 140, being satisfied with the profit of 20 per cent.; when they had\r\nfinished buying, the price instantly broke to 132, and the announcement\r\nof Speyer’s failure, which was made before the close of the day, caused\r\nthem also to fail, as well as half the members of the Gold Room. Owing\r\nto the serious complications prevailing and the disaster being so\r\nwidespread, it was found impossible to continue the clearances through\r\nthe Gold Bank, and the Governing Committee of the Gold Room were at once\r\nconvened, and passed a resolution to suspend all dealings in gold for\r\none week, in order to enable the members to adjust their difficulties\r\nand differences between themselves privately. The Gold Bank also\r\nsuspended business in the meantime. While Albert Speyer was vigorously\r\nbuying and continuing to bid 160 for one million after another, the\r\nclique were as actively engaged in selling all the market would take at\r\nten points less, and also busy making private settlements with the\r\nshorts.\r\n\r\nAs the transactions were purely phantom in their nature, the great\r\nparties in the speculative contest did not really lose much. Contrary to\r\npopular opinion about such transactions, they did, virtually, incur\r\nheavy losses, but in one way or another they managed to evade them.\r\nGould’s losses were estimated at over four millions. Fisk’s were equally\r\nlarge, but he repudiated all of them. Others were heavily saddled,\r\nhowever, with the burden which he should have borne.\r\n\r\nImporting merchants were among the greatest sufferers, and a large\r\nnumber of them were forced to cover at high figures.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of the Gold Board caused many important failures. Private\r\nsettlements were made during a period of sixty days following, in many\r\ninstances on the basis of a compromise.\r\n\r\nWhen Fisk heard that Secretary Boutwell had ordered gold sold, he\r\nexclaimed that it would knock spots out of phantom gold, and send him\r\nand others with their long stuff “where the woodbine twineth.” The full\r\neffect of the disaster became more fully realized when the Gold Board\r\nand Gold Bank suspended and the numerous large failures were announced;\r\nthen it almost seemed that a general state of chaos reigned, and how to\r\nunravel the complications was the problem to be solved. No one that had\r\nany connection with gold dealings during the eventful day could\r\npositively tell how they actually stood, or how to estimate their losses\r\nor gains; such was the uncertainty as to future results, and the doubt\r\nas to who was, and who was not, going to pay the differences due. The\r\nBoard Room was crowded almost to suffocation, and the scene just prior\r\nto its close partook of the appearance of Bedlam let loose; in fact, it\r\nhad not been much different during the entire day. Late in the\r\nafternoon, a formidable body of enraged sufferers assembled at the doors\r\nof Smith, Gould & Martin’s office, and many and boisterous were the\r\nthreats that were indulged in against the members of the firm, in\r\nconsequence of which a police guard was detailed for their protection.\r\n\r\nThe gold furore brought many Israelites to Wall Street, who since, by\r\ntheir numbers and natural shrewdness, have become quite formidable in\r\nour midst.\r\n\r\nOne of them, being very long of the precious metal, on its break from\r\n160 to 140, fainted; water was soon obtained to bathe his feverish brow,\r\nand rubbing was also adopted. When, finally, he had sufficiently\r\nrecovered to raise his head and open his eyes, looking all around he\r\nsaid: “What ish the prish now?” Upon finding it still lower, he closed\r\nhis eyes again, and fell into another swoon. He was finally carried from\r\nthe Gold Room a sick and ruined, but a wiser Hebrew, and is now in the\r\n“ole cloe” business on the East side.\r\n\r\nThis is the history in brief, but the scenes and incidents of that day\r\nwould furnish material for an interesting volume.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am not much given to the sensational, I have collected a few\r\nof the leading events in detail, which I think are worth putting in\r\npermanent form, if I may presume that this book itself may happily\r\npartake of that character.\r\n\r\nThe inside history of the conspiracy to put up the price of gold is also\r\nfull of interesting material, and shows how deeply laid the scheme was\r\nto take advantage of the circumstances and of the feeling which existed\r\nin favor of stimulating our exports at the time. I shall, therefore,\r\ngive an epitome of the salient points behind the scenes of the great\r\nspeculative plot, and the bold attempt made to involve President Grant\r\nand his family in the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAs I have intimated, Jim Fisk, Jr., or Jim Jubilee Junior, as he was\r\nthen popularly called, was eventually put forth as the active member of\r\nthe manipulating coterie. The clique made very good use of him, also, at\r\nintervals during the period they were concerting their plans.\r\n\r\nFisk had originally been a peddler in New England, as his father had\r\nbeen. He appeared in Wall Street a few years previous to the great gold\r\nconspiracy as one of the confidential men of Daniel Drew. Having shown\r\nthat he was too sharp for some of the people in the broker’s office\r\nwhere Mr. Drew made his headquarters, he received a polite hint that his\r\npresence there was undesirable. Mr. Fisk then opened an office of his\r\nown, and united his speculative fortunes with those of Mr. William\r\nBelden. The name of the firm was Fisk & Belden. It was of but short\r\nduration. It seems that they had difficulty in finding bankers to\r\naccommodate them to the extent required, and they closed up the\r\nbusiness. But though Fisk failed of success in this instance as a\r\nbroker, his resources were not by any means exhausted. He made himself\r\ngenerally useful to Mr. Drew, who still adhered to him.\r\n\r\nAs the result of this friendship and his own smartness, in a short time\r\nafterwards Mr. Fisk was elected to the directory of the Erie Railroad\r\nCompany, and Mr. Drew, who had forwarded his interest in that direction,\r\nwas left out. This is an instance of the way Fisk made the best use of\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nAs the result of Fisk’s election to the Erie Board, forty thousand\r\nshares of new stock were issued. Bold attempts were made to gobble up\r\nother railroads through the same instrumentality. Fuller information on\r\nthese matters is given in my chapters on Drew, Gould, and the struggle\r\nwith Vanderbilt.\r\n\r\nFisk began to be considered a universal genius at that time, and had\r\nacquired the sobriquet of Prince of Erie. Though he had no money to\r\noperate with when he made his debut in Wall Street, soon after this\r\nlarge issue of Erie stock, he began to show signs of wealth very\r\nrapidly. He had the reputation of being the fortunate owner of several\r\nrailroads and steamboats, an opera house, at least one bench of judges,\r\nan unlimited number of lawyers and a bevy of ballet girls.\r\n\r\nThe Head Centre of this gold conspiracy needs no introduction here, as I\r\nhave attempted to do him ample justice in another chapter. He was also\r\nthe power behind the throne in Erie as well as in the Gold clique. He\r\npulled the wires while Fisk was the imposing factotum who was exhibited\r\nto an admiring public. He managed the courts, the judges and the\r\nlawyers, while Fisk got the reputation of doing this fine work, but was\r\nsimply the mechanical executive. He had made himself solid with the\r\nLegislature also, and had acquired a hold on Erie that enabled him to\r\nuse that property just as he pleased for his own personal benefit,\r\nambition and purposes.\r\n\r\nErie was a mighty power at that time, with a wonderful leverage for\r\nraising money. When cash was needed to purchase another railroad, a\r\nlegislature or a court, all that was necessary was to sell a few hundred\r\nthousand of Convertible Bonds and turn them into Erie shares. Mr. Gould\r\nwas thus fortified with ample means of raising money on call at the time\r\nhe played the heavy role in the events which culminated in the disaster\r\nof Black Friday.\r\n\r\nThough the circumstances at that time were all in favor of success in\r\nsuch a plot, it required a mind with great grasp and wonderful powers of\r\ngeneralization to take advantage of all the bearings of the situation,\r\nand to utilize everything toward the great end in view. Gould did his\r\nwork as chief of the conspiracy with rare tact and marvellous sagacity.\r\n\r\nA resume of the conspicuous points in the situation and the plot will\r\nmake this clear.\r\n\r\nThe supply of gold in the New York market then did not exceed 25\r\nmillions. The Government held less than 100 millions, and about\r\none-fourth of this was in the form of special deposits represented by\r\ngold certificates, part of which were deposited in the banks and the\r\nremainder circulating throughout the country. Gold was then being sold\r\nby the Treasury at the rate of a million a month, in accordance with a\r\nplan that had been adopted as the best financial policy, both for the\r\nadministration and the prosperity of the country. This had always a\r\ntendency to keep the price down, but on account of the circumstances\r\nbriefly related in the beginning of this chapter, this policy of selling\r\ngold, owing to our commercial relations, was no longer considered for\r\nthe best interests of the country, and Mr. Boutwell, with his coadjutors\r\nin the Treasury, were bound to give ear to the opinions of the bankers\r\nand business men in the interest of our export trade.\r\n\r\nAlthough the policy of stopping the sale of gold had been agreed upon in\r\ndeference to the views of the best financiers of the country, yet Mr.\r\nGould and his fellow strategists thought it was best to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure on this point, in order that nothing might stand in the way\r\nof the great speculative intrigue, to get a “corner” in gold. President\r\nGrant was conservative on the subject. The conspirators, therefore,\r\nconceived the design of arranging things so that Secretary Boutwell\r\ncould not depart from this policy, no matter what emergency might arise.\r\n\r\nThis bold and wicked strategy could only be successful by first getting\r\nPresident Grant convinced that the theory of stopping the gold sales was\r\nthe only commercial salvation for the country in the then condition of\r\nbusiness stagnation and the possible panic threatened. The theory was\r\nthen to impress him with the necessity of giving Secretary Boutwell an\r\nabsolute order not to sell gold, and afterwards to fix things so that it\r\nwould be impossible for the President to revoke that order until the\r\nbrilliant speculative purposes of the clique in cornering gold should be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was but little short of treason, regarded from a patriotic\r\npoint of view, and it is very questionable if the perpetrators would\r\nhave stopped short of this dastardly act, had they not been convinced\r\nthat their purpose was fully compassed by a method less villainous and\r\nshocking. It was considered indispensable by the conspirators, for the\r\nconsummation of their plans, that Grant should be got out of the way by\r\nsome means or other. Fortunately for him, and for the honor of the\r\nnation, the plan succeeded without the necessity of offering him any\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining how this was done it is necessary to describe briefly\r\na few of the preliminary events which formed a portion of the plot.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that General Grant should accompany a party, one\r\nbeautiful evening in the middle of June, who were going to attend the\r\ngreat Peace Jubilee of Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore in Boston. Jim Fisk did\r\nthe executive work in the arrangement. There was a fine champagne supper\r\non board the Boston boat, and several gentlemen were present who were\r\nthoroughly conversant with financial questions, and could talk glibly on\r\nthe state of the country. The subject of exports and the policy of\r\nstopping the sale of gold were thoroughly discussed. It was a feast of\r\nreason, and those who have imagined that it was all flow of soul, on\r\nthat festive occasion, do very scant justice to the intelligence that\r\nwas at the bottom of the deep design of the nocturnal excursion, planned\r\nby Gould, Fisk & Co. General Grant was an eager listener to all that was\r\nsaid on the most interesting subject of that day, but his mind, it would\r\nseem, was not then thoroughly made up that the best policy for the\r\nprosperity of the country was to stop the sale of gold. He was undecided\r\non that point, and it required well directed reasons to convince him.\r\nMr. Gould observed this and foresaw what was necessary to be done. The\r\ndrift of the conversation, when this point was brought clearly out, was\r\nvery succinctly described by Mr. Gould in his testimony before the\r\nGarfield Investigating Committee. He said: “The President was a\r\nlistener. The other gentlemen were discussing. Some were in favor of\r\nBoutwell’s selling gold, and some were opposed to it. After they all\r\ninterchanged their views, some one asked the President what his views\r\nwere. He remarked that he thought there was a certain amount of\r\nfictitiousness about the prosperity of the country and the bubble might\r\nas well be tapped in one way as the other. That was the substance of his\r\nremark. He asked me what I thought about it. I remarked that I thought\r\nif that policy was carried out it would produce great distress and\r\nalmost lead to civil war; it would produce strikes among the workmen,\r\nand the workshops, to a great extent, would have to be closed; the\r\nmanufactories would have to stop. I took the ground that the Government\r\nought to let gold alone, and let it find its commercial level; that, in\r\nfact, it ought to facilitate an upward movement of gold in the fall. The\r\nfall and winter is the only time that we have any interest in. That was\r\nall that occurred at that time.”\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to observe that I am merely quoting Gould from the\r\nreport, and am not by any means responsible for his confusion of ideas\r\nand grammar.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to show how ably Mr. Gould played his part in\r\nattempting to get the President into the proper frame of mind to enable\r\nhim to endorse a policy so vital to the interests of the country and to\r\nthe success of the gold clique.\r\n\r\n“I took the ground,” says Gould, “that the Government ought to let gold\r\nalone and let it find its commercial level.”\r\n\r\nThis reference to “its commercial level” is rich, coming from the\r\nhead-centre of the plotters who wanted to put the article up to 200.\r\nThen, in another afterthought, he says: “It (the Government) ought to\r\nfacilitate an upward movement of gold in the fall.”\r\n\r\nHow artfully insinuating was this suggestion in the interest of our\r\nforeign commerce! It showed clearly the power the man possesses of\r\nrising to the patriotic height of the occasion. This is a characteristic\r\nof Mr. Gould that few people know how to appreciate at its true worth.\r\nIt has stood out conspicuously in his character in many other\r\nexigencies. It reminds one of the unkind but vigorous remark of the\r\nfamous old English critic, Dr. Samuel Johnson: “Patriotism, Sir,” said\r\nthe old cynic, “is the last refuge of a scoundrel.”\r\n\r\nAbout the time the above events were transpiring, the Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. H. H. Van Dyck, resigned his office in\r\nthis city. Mr. Gould’s chief ambition at that time was to name his\r\nsuccessor, in order that he might be able to control the Treasury when\r\nthe time to get a “corner” in gold should be ripe. Mr. Abel R. Corbin\r\ncame in quite handy at this juncture to help to further the designs of\r\nMr. Gould. He was a man of fair education and considerable experience\r\nboth in business and politics. He had been a lobbyist in Washington for\r\nsome years. He was well informed on financial matters, a pretty good\r\nwriter, and could “talk like a book.” His wife was a sister of Mrs.\r\nGrant, and he had good opportunities for reaching the Presidential ear,\r\nwhich he employed to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nA gentleman named Robert B. Catherwood, who was married to a\r\nstep-daughter of Mr. Corbin, was approached by Gould and Corbin on the\r\nsubject of the assistant-treasuryship. They were anxious that Mr.\r\nCatherwood should take the office, and told him he could make a great\r\ndeal of money in a perfectly legitimate manner if he were once\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Catherwood stated in his testimony before the Investigating\r\nCommittee, but he adds, “My ideas differed from theirs in what\r\nconstituted a legitimate manner, and I declined the office.”\r\n\r\nThe office then sought another man in the person of General Daniel\r\nButterfield. He received the intimation of his appointment in a very\r\ndifferent spirit from Mr. Catherwood, showing that he was fully equal to\r\nthe occasion. He wrote a letter to Mr. Corbin thanking him kindly for\r\nthe offer, saying that he was under numerous obligations to him, and\r\nexpressing a hope that he would be eminently successful in his\r\nundertaking. General Butterfield received his commission in due course.\r\n\r\nThis made perfect another link in the chain of Mr. Gould’s speculative\r\ndesign, as he supposed. It made Corbin “solid” with Gould also, a\r\nposition which they both highly appreciated. Mr. Gould paid the\r\nfollowing tribute of admiration to the true value of Corbin in the\r\nenterprise: “He was a very shrewd old gentleman. He saw at a glance the\r\nwhole case, and said he thought it was the true platform to stand on;\r\nthat whatever the Government could do legitimately and fairly to\r\nfacilitate the exportation of breadstuffs and produce good prices for\r\nthe West, they ought to do so. He was anxious that I should see the\r\nPresident, and communicate to him my views on the subject.” Corbin\r\ntalked with Grant until he received a positive assurance that Boutwell\r\nwas not to sell any more gold. At a meeting in Grant’s house, where\r\nGould and Corbin were present, the President said: “Boutwell gave an\r\norder to sell gold, and I heard of it, and countermanded the order.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until Gould had received positive assurance from the\r\nPresident’s own lips, that he considered his scheme perfect. But the\r\nlinks of this strategic chain were now nearly all forged. The bankers\r\nand merchants were largely in his favor through commercial necessity,\r\nthe Sub-Treasury was “fixed,” as he thought, and the Executive fiat had\r\nplaced the Treasury of the United States itself where it could not spoil\r\nthe deal if Grant did not change his mind. There were reasons, of\r\ncourse, to apprehend that he would do so in case of an emergency; for he\r\nnever was privy to the scheme, no matter what his traducers and\r\npolitical enemies may have said.\r\n\r\nTo ensure perfect safety, then, Grant must be put out of the way\r\ntemporarily. This was the crowning effort of the conspirators. After the\r\nBoston Peace Jubilee, this Cabal spent the remaining part of the summer\r\nin maturing its designs. Large enterprises of this nature always require\r\ntime and patience. I am told that “Billy” Porter, “Sheeny” Mike and\r\nother eminent burglars will work assiduously from six to twelve months\r\nstudying all the ins and outs of a bank or other financial concern\r\nbefore coming to the point of using the “jimmy,” blowing the safe or\r\nchloroforming the janitor.\r\n\r\nIt seemed necessary that all the members of the Cabal should be fully\r\nacquainted with the combination to Grant’s purposes as regarded his\r\norders to Boutwell, and that his ideas should remain fixed on the theory\r\nof increasing exportation for the country’s safety. Accordingly it was\r\narranged that Jim Fisk should visit the President at Newport, where he\r\nwas on a visit, some time about the middle of August, a month or so\r\nprior to Black Friday. It would seem that Grant at this date was still\r\nwavering, and adhering to his policy of selling gold in spite of the\r\norder which he had given Boutwell. He may have been suspecting that the\r\nanxiety of Gould, Corbin & Co. for the prosperity of the country was not\r\naltogether genuine. The necessity of bringing further pressure to bear\r\nupon him was therefore clearly manifest.\r\n\r\nReferring to the interview at Newport, Fisk said: “I think it was some\r\ntime in August that General Grant started to go to Newport. I then went\r\ndown to see him. I had seen him before, but not feeling as thoroughly\r\nacquainted as I desired for this purpose, I took a letter of\r\nintroduction from Mr. Gould, in which it was stated that there were\r\nthree hundred sail of vessels then on the Mediterranean, from the Black\r\nSea, with grain to supply the Liverpool market. Gold was then about\r\nthirty-four. If it continued at that price, we had very little chance of\r\ncarrying forward the crop during the fall. I know that we felt nervous\r\nabout it. I talked with General Grant on the subject and endeavored, as\r\nfar as I could, to convince him that his policy was one that would only\r\nbring destruction on us all. He then asked me when we should have an\r\ninterview, and we agreed upon the time. He said: ‘During that time I\r\nwill see Mr. Boutwell, or have him there.’”\r\n\r\nThe President was carefully shadowed after this by the detectives of the\r\nclique, and great care was taken to throw men across his path who were\r\nfluent talkers on the great financial problem of the day, the absolute\r\nnecessity of stimulating the export trade and raising the premium upon\r\ngold for that patriotic purpose. In this way, President Grant began to\r\nthink that the opinion of almost everybody he talked with on this\r\nsubject was on the same side, and must, therefore, be correct.\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of September it was considered that the opinions of the\r\nPresident had been worked up fairly to the sticking point, and Gould\r\nbought $1,500,000 in gold at 132½ for Corbin. Gould, however, was timid\r\nin his purchasing at first, as he had heard that a number of operators\r\nwho were short of gold were making arrangements to give Secretary\r\nBoutwell a dinner. On further assurances from Corbin that the President\r\nhad written Boutwell to sell no gold without consulting him, Gould\r\nprepared to go ahead with the execution of his great scheme. Nothing\r\nremained to be done in the completion of the plot except to stow away\r\nthe President in a place of safety until the financial storm should blow\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThings were so managed that the President was placed in a position that\r\nhis honor was seriously in danger of being compromised, yet so ably was\r\nthe matter engineered that he was perfectly unconscious of the designs\r\nof the plotters.\r\n\r\nHe was prevailed upon to go to a then obscure town in Pennsylvania,\r\nnamed Little Washington. The thing was so arranged that his feelings\r\nwere worked upon to visit that place for the purpose of seeing an old\r\nfriend who resided there. The town was cut off from telegraphic\r\ncommunication, and the other means of access were not very convenient.\r\nThere the President was ensconced, to remain for a week or so about the\r\ntime the Cabal was fully prepared for action.\r\n\r\nSometime about the period of the President’s departure for Little\r\nWashington, Fisk bought seven or eight millions of gold. Gould then said\r\nto Fisk: “This matter is all fixed up. Butterfield is all right. Corbin\r\nhas got Butterfield all right, and Corbin has got Grant fixed all right,\r\nand in my opinion they are all interested together.”\r\n\r\nThis was patriotism with a vengeance. Just think of the audacity of it!\r\nGould enters into a scheme to place the President in a position where he\r\ncould not interfere with the plan of getting a “corner” in gold, and\r\nthen he turns around and accuses the first Magistrate of the Republic\r\nwith being privy to a plot that was calculated to create a panic, and\r\ncause widespread disaster in business circles, and render him an object\r\nof universal contempt.\r\n\r\nGould and Fisk, through Corbin, also attempted to compromise Grant’s\r\nfamily, as well as his private Secretary, General Horace Porter. This\r\nintention was fully disclosed through the interview of Fisk with Corbin.\r\nFisk testified: “When I met Corbin he talked very shy about the matter\r\nat first, but finally came right out and told me that Mrs. Grant had an\r\ninterest; that $500,000 in gold had been taken at 31 and 32, which had\r\nbeen sold at 37; that Mr. Corbin held for himself about two millions of\r\ngold, $500,000 of which was for Mrs. Grant and $500,000 for Porter. I\r\ndid not ask whether he was General or not. I remember the name Porter.\r\nThis was given out very slowly. He let out just as fast as I did when he\r\nfound that Gould had told me about the same thing. I said: ‘Now, I have\r\nhad nothing to do with your transactions in one way or the other. We\r\nhave embarked in a scheme that looks like one of large magnitude. Mr.\r\nGould has lost as the thing stands now. It looks as if it might be a\r\npretty serious business before getting out straight again. The whole\r\nsuccess depends on whether the Government will unload on to us or not.’\r\nHe said: ‘You need not have the least fear.’ I said: ‘I want to know\r\nwhether what Mr. Gould told me is true. I want to know whether you have\r\nsent this $25,000 to Washington, as he states?’ He then told me that he\r\nhad sent it, that Mr. Gould had sold $500,000 in gold belonging to Mrs.\r\nGrant, which cost 32, for 37 or something in that neighborhood, leaving\r\na balance in her favor of about $27,000, and that a check for $25,000\r\nhad been sent. Said I: ‘Mr. Corbin, what can you show me that goes still\r\nfurther than your talk?’ ‘Oh, well,’ the old man said, ‘I can’t show you\r\nanything, but,’ said he, ‘this is all right.’ He talked freely and\r\nrepeated: ‘I tell you it is all right.’ When I went away from there, I\r\nhad made up my mind that Corbin had told me the truth.”\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to prove, before the Garfield Committee, that a\r\npackage containing $25,000 was sent to Mrs. Grant through the Adams\r\nExpress Company, but expert testimony failed to decide whether the\r\namount was that or $250, as the two noughts at the extreme right were\r\ncrowded into the cents column, and it was difficult to determine whether\r\nor not a very light “period” was placed between them and the “$250.”\r\n\r\nThe design of the clique was manifest, however, to implicate the family\r\nof the President in some way or other, in order that they might make use\r\nof the Executive influence to help accomplish their great speculative\r\npurpose. But as the Garfield Committee truly said in its report: “The\r\nwicked and cunningly devised attempt of the conspirators to compromise\r\nthe President of the United States or his family utterly failed.”\r\n\r\nThe scheme might have succeeded if Fisk had been possessed of the\r\ncoolness and penetration of his partner, but his impetuosity, anxiety\r\nand enthusiasm aroused suspicion and partially spoiled the plot.\r\n\r\nFisk was so eager to be satisfied that Grant was all right that he\r\noverdid the thing by urging Corbin to write Grant a letter to stand firm\r\nand not to permit the Treasury to sell gold under any consideration. The\r\noutcome of this afforded clear proof, if any were wanting, that Grant\r\nhad no guilty knowledge of the base purposes for which he was being\r\nused. Fisk had this letter from Corbin sent by a special messenger from\r\nPittsburgh, who rode twenty-eight miles on horseback, and delivered it\r\nin person to the President. He read the letter, and had his suspicions\r\nat once aroused. He said laconically to the messenger, “It is\r\nsatisfactory; there is no answer.” He began to see through the game, and\r\nat once desired Mrs. Grant to write to Mrs. Corbin requesting her\r\nhusband to have nothing more to do with the Gould-Fisk gang.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant wrote to Mrs. Corbin to say that the President was greatly\r\ntroubled to learn that her husband had been speculating in Wall Street,\r\nand that she should desire him to disconnect himself immediately with\r\nthe party who were attempting to entrap the President.\r\n\r\nCorbin hastened to obey the mandate from Little Washington. He was\r\ngreatly agitated, but the ruling passion of avarice was strong; in\r\nbidding Gould farewell, and before taking his final adieu of the clique,\r\nhe requested the arch plotter to hand him over his share of the profits.\r\nReferring to this incident, Gould said: “I told him I would give\r\n$100,000 on account, and that when I sold, if he liked, I would give him\r\nthe average of my sales. I did not feel like buying any gold of him\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nThis was the denouement of the plot against the President, who\r\nimmediately hastened to big Washington.\r\n\r\nNow, let me again ask the reader to turn his attention for a moment to\r\nthe concluding scenes in the speculative drama in Wall Street on Black\r\nFriday. How the clique tried to manipulate Assistant-Secretary\r\nButterfield was kept as profoundly secret as possible, and as it turned\r\nout, he did not have as much power over the events of that great day as\r\nwas expected. When somebody charged Fisk with tapping the telegraph\r\nwires, however, to obtain information from the Government, he replied:\r\n“It was only necessary to tap Butterfield to find out all we wanted.”\r\n\r\nThis was very likely a vain boast of Fisk.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 22d September, two days preceding Black Friday, the\r\nclique, it is believed, owned several millions more gold than there was\r\nin the city outside the vaults of the Sub-Treasury. Belden bought about\r\neight millions of gold on that day, while Smith, Gould, Martin & Co.\r\nwere also heavy purchasers. The clique held a caucus in the office of\r\nWilliam Heath & Co., in Broad street, and concluded that it had gold\r\nenough to put the price to 200, if it could carry the gold without\r\nlending and compel the “shorts” to purchase. But the idea of finding a\r\nmarket for over thirty millions of gold was also a gigantic problem, and\r\nthey felt the risk of being ground between the upper and the nether\r\nmillstones of their scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Thursday another council of war was held in the office\r\nof Belden & Co., on Broadway. At this meeting, Gould, Fisk, Henry N.\r\nSmith and William Belden were present. The proceedings of this meeting\r\nwere kept a profound secret, but one result of it was that Belden gave\r\nhis clerk the famous order to put gold to 144 and keep it there. On that\r\nday Belden purchased about twenty millions of gold, the price opening at\r\n141½ and closing at 143½.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the Cabal had another private meeting up town that\r\nevening. The great question of closing up the transactions on the\r\nfollowing day was the chief topic of discussion. These operators held\r\ncontracts for over $100,000,000 in gold. Gould said that the “short”\r\ninterest was $250,000,000. The total amount of gold in the city did not\r\nexceed $25,000,000, and the difference between this and the aggregate\r\namount of the contracts of the clique was the enormous amount that would\r\nhave to be settled in the event of a “corner.”\r\n\r\nFisk proposed that the clique show its hand, publish the state of\r\naffairs, and offer to settle with the shorts at 150. His plan was\r\nrejected by his brother conspirators.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fatal day, Belden and William Heath had an early\r\nbreakfast together at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and repaired immediately\r\nto their offices. Belden announced that gold was going to 200. “This\r\nwill be the last day of the Gold Room,” he added. Moved by Belden’s\r\nthreat, a large number rushed to cover. In the language of Henry N.\r\nSmith, “They came on with a rush to settle.” He was settling in the\r\noffice of Smith, Gould & Martin, at 150 to 145, while Albert Speyer,\r\nacting as broker for Fisk and Gould, was bidding up to 160 for a million\r\nat a time. It was only when the price came down to 133 that Speyer\r\nrealized the humorous absurdity of his position. He had then bought 26\r\nmillions since morning at 160.\r\n\r\nA voracious demand for margins about midday brought the work to a\r\ncrisis. The scene at the office of Heath was indescribable when Belden\r\nwent there to see Gould and his confederates, to find out what was to be\r\ndone next with the frenzied purchasers. An eye-witness thus describes\r\nthe scene at Heath’s office: “I went outside while Belden went in. I\r\nwalked up and down the alley-way waiting for him to come out. Deputy\r\nsheriffs, or men appearing to be such, began to arrive and to mount\r\nguard at Heath’s office to keep out visitors. After waiting a prodigious\r\nlong time, as it seemed to me, Jay Gould came creeping out of the back\r\ndoor, and looking round sharply to see if he was watched, slunk off\r\nthrough a private rear passage behind the buildings. Presently came\r\nFisk, steaming hot and shouting. He took the wrong direction at first,\r\nnearly ran into Broad street, but soon discovered his error, and\r\nfollowed Gould through the rear passage. Then came Belden, with hair\r\ndisordered and red eyes, as if he had been crying. He called: ‘Which way\r\nhave they gone?’ and, upon my pointing the direction, he ran after them.\r\nThe rear passage led into Wall Street. At its exit the conspirators\r\njumped into a carriage and fled the Street.”\r\n\r\nThey did not fly the Street, however, but went to the Broad street\r\noffice of Smith, Gould & Martin, where the crowd assembled, evidently\r\nwith riotous intent, apparently bent upon an application to Judge Lynch\r\nfor justice; and had any of the gentlemen appeared outside the confines\r\nof the front wall, the chances were that the lamp-post near by would\r\nhave very soon been decorated with a breathless body. To ensure their\r\nsafety inside, however, a small police force kept guard outside, which\r\nmade the barricade complete. These gentlemen remained under this shelter\r\nuntil the small hours of the morning, busily endeavoring to find out\r\nwhere they stood in the result of the gold deal, and the more they\r\npondered over it, the greater grew the doubt in their minds whether they\r\nwere standing on their heads or their heels.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Black Friday “corner” was a temporary calamity, perhaps it\r\nwas worth all it cost, in teaching us a useful lesson in financial and\r\nspeculative affairs. In my chapter on “Panics, and How to Prevent Them,”\r\nI think I have made several points clear that can be utilized by\r\nfinanciers, speculators and investors to advantage, in ease of an\r\nimpending panic or “corner.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n        CAUSES OF LOSS IN SPECULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nINADEQUATE INFORMATION.—FALSE INFORMATION.—DEFECTS OF NEWS\r\n    AGENCIES.—INSUFFICIENCY OF MARGINS.—DANGERS OF PERSONAL\r\n    IDIOSYNCRASIES.—OPERATING IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON.—NECESSITY OF\r\n    INTELLIGENCE, JUDGMENT AND NERVE.—AN IDEAL STANDARD.—WHAT MAKES A\r\n    KING AMONG SPECULATORS?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs there is always a class of speculators whose operations, in the long\r\nrun, leave a net result of loss rather than profit, it may not be amiss\r\nif I state what experience has taught me as to the causes of this want\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, many who enter the arena of speculation are in every way\r\nunfitted to take the risks against such wily opponents as they must\r\nencounter. They are either too ignorant or too wise, too timid or too\r\nbold, too pessimistic or too sanguine, too slow or too hasty, too\r\ndiffident or too conceited, too confiding or too incredulous. These are\r\nconstitutional defects, any one of which may easily cost an operator a\r\nfortune. And yet self-knowledge, with self-control, may prevent these\r\nnatural disqualifications from seriously interfering with success. There\r\nis no mental discipline more severe and exacting than that of\r\nspeculation. There is no pursuit in which a man can less afford to\r\nindulge in whims, or prejudices, or pet theories, than that of staking\r\nhis money against the prospective changes in financial values. He must\r\nbe as calm and as impartial as a judge, not less in respect to the risks\r\nhe incurs than in regard to the integrity of his own judgment. I should\r\nlay it down as the first rule necessary to success, that the judgment be\r\nnot warped by any natural idiosyncrasies; this being secured, a man may\r\nsucceed in spite of his constitutional defects.\r\n\r\nSingular as it may seem, there are no advantages beset with greater\r\ndangers than information—the one thing most largely sought after and\r\nmost highly prized. Very naturally, most men object to taking a risk\r\nwithout possessing some knowledge of the conditions that determine the\r\nrisk; and yet how few take care that their knowledge is adequate enough\r\nor certain enough for the formation of a safe judgment. In some cases,\r\nknowledge is unattainable and the operation must be a leap in the dark;\r\nand in such instances a man is unwise to step in unless his experience\r\nsatisfies him that he is uncommonly sagacious in guessing.\r\n\r\nMany speculators lose because the information on which they base their\r\noperations is _insufficient_; more because it is _false_; and others\r\nbecause, while their information is correct, they do _not know how to\r\nturn it to account_.\r\n\r\nBetween one or other of these difficulties in the use of information\r\nmust be distributed a very large proportion of the losses incurred in\r\nspeculation. Incomplete or insufficient information is especially\r\ndangerous. One-sided knowledge is nowhere so deceiving as here. A\r\nrailroad, for instance, may report an increase of gross earnings which\r\nis construed as making its stock worth two or three per cent. more than\r\nits current price; but the improvement may be due to transient special\r\ncauses, and the road’s current expenses may be growing at a rate which\r\nmakes the net increase show a decrease. A financially embarrassed\r\ncompany may announce an assessment of its stockholders, upon which there\r\nis a rush to sell the stock; a little further explanation shows that the\r\nproceeds of the assessment will so improve the facilities of the\r\ncompany, or so enable it to reduce its fixed charges, as to make the\r\nstock intrinsically far more valuable than it was before; this discovery\r\ncauses a sharp advance in the shares, and the “short” sellers have to\r\ncover their sales at a loss. A stock is bought up freely at New York\r\nbecause London is taking large amounts of it; a day or two later, the\r\ndeliveries show that large holders connected with the management are\r\nunloading on the foreign market upon knowledge of facts damaging to the\r\nprospects of the property; the late buyers then rush to realize, and\r\npocket a loss instead of a profit. Every day furnishes new instances of\r\nspeculations undertaken on this incomplete kind of information, and\r\nwhich end disastrously because the operators did not wait to be informed\r\non all sides of the case, but were satisfied to take a pound of\r\nassumption with but an ounce of fact.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest anomalies of speculation is in the facility with\r\nwhich men are induced to take large risks on false information and\r\nmanufactured “points.” Considering the readiness with which a numerous\r\nclass of “outside” operators buy or sell on sensational rumors, it is\r\nnot surprising that the professional operators should keep the market\r\nwell supplied with such decoys; and it is not easy to say which most\r\ndeserves condemnation—the heedless credulity of the dupes, or the\r\ndeliberate lies of the canard-makers. There is, however, a third party\r\nnot less blameable than either of the foregoing. I refer to those who\r\nmake it a part of their business to circulate false information.\r\nPrincipal among these caterers are the financial news agencies and the\r\nmorning Wall Street news sheet, both specially devoted to the\r\nspeculative interests that centre at the Stock Exchange. The object of\r\nthese agencies is a useful one; but the public have a right to expect\r\nthat when they subscribe for information upon which immense transactions\r\nmay be undertaken, the utmost caution, scrutiny and fidelity should be\r\nexercised in the procurement and publication of the news. Anything that\r\nfalls short of this is something worse than bad service and bad faith\r\nwith subscribers; it is dishonest and mischievous. And yet it cannot be\r\ndenied that much of the so-called news that reaches the public through\r\nthese instrumentalities must come under this condemnation. The “points,”\r\nthe “puffs,” the alarms and the canards, put out expressly to deceive\r\nand mislead, find a wide circulation through these mediums, with an ease\r\nwhich admits of no possible justification. How far these lapses are due\r\nto the haste inseparable from the compilation of news of such a\r\ncharacter, how far to a lack of proper sifting and caution, and how far\r\nto less culpable reasons, I do not pretend to decide; but this will be\r\nadmitted by every observer, that the circulation of pseudo news is the\r\nfrequent cause of incalculable losses. Nor is it alone in the matter of\r\ncirculating false information that these news vendors are at fault. The\r\nhabit of retailing “points” in the interest of cliques, the volunteering\r\nof advice as to what people should buy and what they should sell, the\r\nstrong speculative bias that runs through their editorial opinions,\r\nthese things appear to most people a revolting abuse of the true\r\nfunctions of journalism. But patent as these things are to those\r\neducated in the ways of Wall Street, there is a large class who accept\r\nsuch effusions as gospel, and are easily led by them into the clutches\r\nof the sharks. It is but just, however, to acknowledge that with these\r\nvery serious drawbacks, both these classes of news agencies render\r\nvaluable service to Wall Street interests, and it is to be hoped that\r\nexperience will convince them that their enterprises would attain a\r\nhigher success through emulating a higher standard.\r\n\r\nAnother source of losses in speculation lies in the speculator not\r\nholding back a cash reserve sufficient to protect him against an adverse\r\ncourse of prices. Ordinarily, the man who speculates is of a sanguine\r\ntemperament, and apt to take risks without sufficient provision against\r\ncontingencies. Hence, it is common with inexperienced operators to use\r\nall their available resources in their original margin. The result is\r\nthat, if prices go against them, they are liable to be closed out and\r\nsaddled with a loss they can ill afford. Such persons should never\r\npledge more than one-half of their available means at the beginning of a\r\ntransaction; the remaining half should be kept as a guarantee against\r\ntheir being “sold out,” or to enable them to duplicate the transaction\r\nat the changed price, so as to make an average likely to yield a profit.\r\nThe violation of this rule creates a class of weak holders, who offer a\r\nconstant inducement to “room-traders” to raid the market; knowing, as\r\nthey do, that when they have impaired these unsupported margins, there\r\nis sure to be a rush of selling orders calculated to break down prices.\r\nIt is safe to say that if better provisions were made for keeping\r\nmargins good, the power of the “bears” and the wreckers would be broken;\r\none-half of the losses of “outside” operators would be obviated, and\r\none-half the risks of speculation would be obliterated.\r\n\r\nAnother class especially exposed to losses are those who always operate\r\nin the same direction. Wall Street has its optimists and pessimists;\r\nthey are such from a constitutional bent; and they are “bull” or “bear”\r\nin season and out of season. As a rule, those that follow a natural\r\ndisposition, rather than the course of the market and the conditions\r\nthat mould it, are sure to bankrupt themselves sooner or later. I do not\r\nmean to maintain that there is no chance for an operator who clings\r\ncontinuously to one side of the market; for in times when conditions\r\nfavor higher prices there is always some profitable work to be done by\r\nthe “bear” in checking excesses of a rise; and, when events favor\r\ndecline, the “bull” may find his chances in intervals of excessive\r\ndecline. But the man who can thus successfully steer his craft against\r\nthe winds and the tides must be a thoroughly trained navigator, cool in\r\ntemperament, capable of reining his natural proclivities, and above all,\r\nthe possessor of means large enough to control, if necessary, the course\r\nof the market by sheer money power. It is needless to say that\r\nnine-tenths of this stereotyped class are devoid of these requisites to\r\nsuccess. One cannot but pity the man with sallow face and sluggish gait\r\nso suggestive of the blue pill, who, when everybody else is feeling the\r\nhappy impulse of a common prosperity, persists in believing that the\r\ncountry is going to the dogs, and steadily sells stocks while everybody\r\nelse is buying them. He is simply ruining himself through\r\nunconsciousness that he views everything through bilious spectacles.\r\nEqually is the man to be commiserated who, from a constitutional\r\nintoxication of hope, keeps on buying and holding when it is manifest\r\nthat the country has passed the summit of an era of prosperity and is\r\ndestined to a general reaction in trade and values. Of course, such men\r\nnever remain long in Wall Street; their pockets are soon emptied, and\r\nthey retire to reflect on the folly of refusing to appreciate and to\r\nfollow the natural drift of the conditions that regulate values.\r\n\r\nA minor source of losses lies in operating at times when the market is\r\nso evenly balanced between opposing forces that there is no chance for\r\nmaking profits. At such times, operators get disgusted at the\r\nsluggishness of the market; they change their holdings from day to day,\r\nwith no advantage except to their broker; and their monthly statement\r\nshows a heavy list of charges for interest and commissions, with no\r\noffset of profits. These intervals of stagnancy sometimes run for weeks,\r\nsometimes for months; and at such times a wise speculator would take\r\ncare to keep out of the market and hold himself in readiness for\r\nanything that may turn up.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to the avoidance of loss that the operator should\r\nmaintain an intelligent watch upon the influences that control the\r\nmarket. Those influences are two-fold—such as are intrinsic to the\r\nmarket, and such as are external to it. Of the former class are those\r\nthat relate to the spirit and tone of the market; the position and\r\ndisposition of the cliques; the action of the large operators; the\r\noverloaded or over-sold state of the market, as indicated by the loaning\r\nrates for stocks; the influence exerted by the upward or downward\r\nmovements in stocks which at the moment are specially active; the\r\npossibility of closing out holders on “stop orders” or on the impairment\r\nof margins; the unloading of influential cliques and the covering of\r\nimportant lines of short sales, &c., &c. Influences of this kind are\r\nvery frequently sufficient of themselves to control the market for a\r\nconsiderable period in direct opposition to the tendency indicated by\r\nexternal conditions. It is, however, no easy matter to form a correct\r\nconclusion as to the drift resulting from this set of factors. They are\r\nso concealed and so changeful, and the symptoms are so vague, that it\r\nrequires long experience, added to unusual sagacity, to determine what\r\nmay be the tendency resulting from the complex action and counteraction\r\nof this set of conditions. Some exceptional operators enjoy an\r\ninstinctive faculty for weighing these shadowy indications with almost\r\nunerring certainty. Such men usually care little about outside\r\ninfluences, except so far as they may affect the market for the moment.\r\nFrom the nature of the case, their transactions are apt to be brief\r\nones, and follow quickly the momentary course of the market They are\r\nreckoned among the most sagacious speculators, and are usually very\r\nsuccessful. But their success is the result of a special natural gift,\r\nand therefore cannot be won by others.\r\n\r\nThe second class of influences above alluded to as external to the\r\nmarket are of a very broad and varied character. They embrace almost\r\neverything that affects the welfare of the country. Those, however,\r\nwhich are most potent are, the state of the crops; the condition of\r\nmanufacturing industries; the state and prospects of trade; the earnings\r\nof the transportation companies; the course of the imports and exports;\r\nthe attitude of the foreign markets towards American securities; the\r\nmovements of the precious metals; the condition of the London and\r\nContinental money markets; the position of the New York banks and the\r\ncourse of currency movements; the action of Congress, of the\r\nLegislatures and of the Courts on matters affecting the value of\r\ninvestments; the acts of labor unions and the drift of labor agitations,\r\nand the course of political and social issues. This may be considered a\r\nrather startling list of topics for a man to keep himself well informed\r\nupon, but there is not one of them which may not any day become a\r\ncontrolling factor in the condition of the stock market. For a man,\r\ntherefore, who aims to keep his knowledge abreast with his business, it\r\nis necessary that he should be a close observer of events. Undoubtedly\r\nfew possess this breadth of information, and most men think it\r\nsufficient to get their knowledge as best they may when the events\r\nhappen. The misfortune in such cases is, that those better informed\r\nutilize the event while the others are “getting posted.” Considering how\r\nmany half-informed or wholly ignorant persons engage in speculation with\r\nmore or less success, it cannot be pretended that to keep informed on\r\nthe foregoing set of conditions is essential to a fair degree of\r\nsuccess. But it must be maintained that such knowledge is of\r\nincalculable value and that a man who has it is in a position to act\r\nwith more intelligence, assurance and success than one without it. To\r\nthose who desire to turn to account all coming changes, and to stand\r\nalways prepared for the good or evil events of the future, this\r\nintelligent comprehension of the status of all the forces that make or\r\nunmake values is absolutely indispensable. And yet it is one thing to\r\npossess this information; another to know how to draw correct\r\nconclusions from it, and yet another to know how best to use it in the\r\narea of speculation. Failure at any one of these points may be fatal to\r\nsuccess and result in disaster.\r\n\r\nI conclude, then, that for a man to be a thoroughly equipped speculator,\r\nit is necessary that he be possessed of extraordinary parts and\r\nattainments. He must be an unceasing and intelligent observer of events\r\nat large, and a sagacious interpreter of symptoms on the Exchange; his\r\njudgment must be sound, not only as to existing conditions, but as to\r\ncoming tendencies, and he must possess the calmness and nerve to face\r\nunflinchingly whatever emergencies may arise. Whoever enjoys these\r\nqualities in the highest degree must be the King of Speculators. As to\r\nothers, their rank must correspond to the degree of their conformity to\r\nthis ideal standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _H.

SENEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of Mr. Henry Villard to Wall Street, after two years’ absence\r\nin Germany, his native land, renews the public interest in the career of\r\nthat bold speculator. My reminiscences of Wall Street affairs would be\r\nincomplete without a sketch of the daring railroad operations of this\r\ngentleman, which so fully illustrate some of the evils to which I have\r\nreferred in my chapter on “Railroad Methods.”\r\n\r\nThe culminating point in the speculative history of Mr. Villard, which\r\ncovered a period of five years, from 1879 to 1884, was the famous blind\r\npool in Northern Pacific.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking up the events of his life in detail, and carrying my\r\nreaders to this point, I shall depart from the usual course of\r\nbiography, and present the more interesting facts of the career of my\r\nhero at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIn his capture, of Northern Pacific he seems to have followed the\r\nmethods of the elder Vanderbilt very closely, with the important\r\nexception that he failed in the consummation of his purpose. Vanderbilt\r\nalways, eventually, triumphed.\r\n\r\nVillard was the chief agent in forming the Oregon Railway and Navigation\r\nCompany, which was organized for the purpose of consolidating the\r\nbusiness of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company with that of the Oregon\r\nSteamship Company, and for the purpose of buying, building and operating\r\nrailroads, as stated in the circular setting forth the objects of the\r\ncompany. The lines of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company extended\r\nfrom Portland west to Wallula Junction.\r\n\r\nThe value of this property was seriously menaced by the project of the\r\nNorthern Pacific to extend its lines west, with a terminus at Tacoma.\r\n\r\nPresident Billings, of the Northern Pacific, rejected a proposition from\r\nMr. Villard to accommodate the Northern Pacific by permitting it to\r\nreach the Pacific coast over the lines of the Oregon Railway Navigation\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Villard resorted to the old Vanderbilt\r\ntactics, by attempting to purchase stock enough of the Northern Pacific\r\nto enable him to control the property. For this purpose he formed a\r\nblind pool, in which Messrs. Woerishoffer, Pullman and Endicott, and a\r\nhost of other solid men, were the original members. A fund of $8,000,000\r\nwas subscribed to purchase Northern Pacific stock. During the spring of\r\n1881 the pool kept on buying steadily, and continued their operations\r\nuntil the middle of summer, when it was discovered that the treasury of\r\nthe pool was almost exhausted without having effected its purpose of\r\nacquiring control of the Northern Pacific property.\r\n\r\nMr. Villard then called a meeting, explained matters, proposed to extend\r\nthe scope of the pool’s operations, and to increase its membership. By\r\nshowing the enormous profits to be gleaned in the future, he succeeded\r\nin getting $12,000,000 more subscribed. This secured the control of the\r\nroad, and in September, 1881, Mr. Villard was elected President of\r\nNorthern Pacific.\r\n\r\nVillard at once emerged from this blind pool into a great railroad\r\nmagnate, in a manner, to the eye of the general public, as miraculous as\r\nthe springing forth of Minerva fully armed from the brain of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe stock of Northern Pacific advanced rapidly in price, and Villard and\r\nhis friends were supposed to be accumulating millions with unprecedented\r\ncelerity. Villard appeared to have realized all the financial dreams of\r\nMonte Cristo, and he was fast looming up into a proud and dangerous\r\nrival of Gould, Vanderbilt and Huntington.\r\n\r\nHe went forward with the building of the Northern Pacific road, which\r\nwas finished two years after his success in capturing it through the\r\nmedium of his blind pool. His phenomenal success induced him to enter\r\nlargely into the extension of other investments. He became lavish in his\r\npersonal expenses also, although he had formerly been accustomed to the\r\nclosest economy in his mode of living, and he built a palace at Madison\r\nAvenue and Fiftieth street.\r\n\r\nWhen seemingly on the highest tide of prosperity, Villard suddenly\r\nbecame embarrassed, and when an accounting of the cost of finishing the\r\nroad was made, he was found to be away behind. There was a\r\nmiscalculation of $20,000,000 somewhere. Villard explained it by\r\ndeclaring that the estimate of the engineers for finishing the road was\r\n$20,000,000, whereas the real cost reached $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor the $20,000,000 subscribed by the blind pool the subscribers\r\nreceived the stock of the Oregon & Transcontinental. This company had\r\nbeen organized to build branch lines to the Northern Pacific, as the\r\ncharter of the latter did not permit it to build such lines.\r\n\r\nThis is the speculative history, in brief, of Mr. Villard from the time\r\nhe took hold of the Oregon & California Railroad up to the juncture of\r\nhis grand collapse. There were several incidents, however, of more than\r\nordinary interest in his railroad history prior to the time he set his\r\nheart upon Northern Pacific. As a stock-waterer he had, probably, no\r\nsuperior, and was only equalled by Mr. George I. Seney, in that\r\nimportant department of railroad management. His methods in obtaining\r\ncontrol of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company and the Oregon Steamship\r\nCompany amply illustrate his remarkable ability in this respect. When\r\nVillard proposed to purchase these two companies he had no money, but he\r\nhad unlimited confidence in his own ability. He asked each company to\r\ngive him an option to run a year for $100,000. They agreed to do this,\r\nand Villard forthwith consulted a number of capitalists, who came\r\ntogether and filed articles of incorporation of the Oregon Railway &\r\nNavigation Company, a consolidation of the two companies above-named.\r\nWhen this company, with such a high sounding name, was organized, it had\r\nno assets, and the prospects of acquiring any seemed exceedingly blue.\r\nThe names of the incorporators were as follows: Henry Villard, James H.\r\nFry, Artemus H. Holmes, Christian Bors, W. H. Starbuck and Charles E.\r\nBrotherton, all of the city and State of New York, and W. H. Corbett, C.\r\nN. Lewis, J. N. Dolph, Paul Schulze and N. Thielson, all of Portland,\r\nOregon. The capital was nominally six million dollars, divided into\r\n60,000 shares. This arrangement was made in June, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe next problem to be solved after the reorganization was how to raise\r\nmoney to run the concern.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors, under the management of Mr. Villard, were equal\r\nto the occasion. They met at Portland a few days after the organization\r\nand executed a mortgage to the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company of New\r\nYork, and under this mortgage issued 6,000 bonds of $1,000 each, payable\r\nin thirty years after July 1, 1879, with interest at 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Villard then paid the $100,000 bonus money to the companies which\r\nhad been incorporated, took his option, stock and bonds and came East to\r\nnegotiate his securities. It is said he presented them to Jay Gould, who\r\nrefused to touch them, as he believed there was not much stamina in the\r\nscheme, and he wished to avoid trouble with the Northern Pacific, which\r\nhe plainly saw the project involved. Villard was more fortunate with Mr.\r\nEndicott, Jr., of Boston, Mr. George Pullman and others whom they\r\ninterested in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe property of the two companies, out of which the new company had been\r\nformed, whose securities were so boldly placed upon the market, was not\r\nin reality purchased until March of the following year.\r\n\r\nAfter the organization was complete, the visible assets of the Oregon\r\nRailway and Navigation Company did not exceed $3,500,000, while the\r\ntotal liabilities amounted to $21,000,000. This was made up as follows:\r\n\r\n                         Original    $6,000,000\r\n                         stock\r\n\r\n                         Water        3,000,000\r\n\r\n                         Water        6,000,000\r\n\r\n                         Mortgage     6,000,000\r\n                         bonds\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that there were seven dollars of liabilities for\r\nevery dollar of assets, and the intrinsic value of the stock was\r\nrepresented by a minus quantity of 20 per cent., having no positive\r\nvalue at all. In other words, it was 20 per cent. worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these facts, however, Mr. Villard had the stock listed at\r\nthe Stock Exchange, and through a carefully prepared report, showing\r\nimmense and unprecedented earnings, he had the stock bulled up to 200.\r\nIt was when it reached this high figure that the $9,000,000 of water\r\n(noted before) were thrown in to prevent it from becoming top-heavy.\r\n\r\nThis was the preparatory and successful process of watering which\r\npreceded the transactions of Mr. Villard on a more magnificent scale in\r\nhis manipulation of Northern Pacific, as described at the opening of\r\nthis chapter. Mr. Villard excelled Mr. Seney in one respect which is\r\nnoteworthy. As I have shown in a former chapter, Mr. Seney poured the\r\nwater in lavishly at the reorganization, and prior to having his\r\nproperties listed on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nVillard improved upon this process by employing Seney’s method liberally\r\nin the first instance, and also by a free and copious dilution after the\r\nstocks had been inflated to the very point of bursting.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no instance in the whole history of railway\r\nmanipulation in which a man has presented to the public, and with such\r\namazing success, such a specious appearance of possessing solid capital\r\nwhere so little existed in reality.\r\n\r\nHe began with nothing in 1879 and succeeded in the course of a year in\r\npossessing himself, by various adroit methods, as described, of\r\n$3,500,000 of assets in railroad securities. With this as a basis of\r\noperation, in five years he managed to obtain temporary control of\r\nproperty aggregating in value over $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                FERDINAND WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECULIAR POWER AND METHODS OF THE PRINCE OF SWINDLERS.—HOW HE DUPED\r\n    ASTUTE FINANCIERS AND BUSINESS MEN OF ALL SORTS, AND SECURED THE\r\n    SUPPORT OF EMINENT STATESMEN AND LEADING BANK OFFICERS, WHOM HE\r\n    ROBBED OF MILLIONS OF MONEY.—THE MOST ARTFUL DODGER OF MODERN\r\n    TIMES.—THE TRUTH OF THE SWINDLE PRACTICED UPON GENERAL GRANT AND HIS\r\n    FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making a fair estimate of the part that Ferdinand Ward, of the firm\r\nof Grant & Ward, played in the panic of 1884, I can only say that Ward’s\r\nmethods, taken altogether in their conception and execution, constituted\r\na huge confidence game. He built up confidence by deceiving a few\r\neminent men in financial and social circles, who, from his insinuating\r\nand plausible demeanor, were induced to place reliance upon his\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\nHis presence was magnetic, and his manner deceitfully unassuming. He had\r\nthe art of dissembling in great perfection and was possessed of\r\nextraordinarily persuasive powers, without appearing to have any selfish\r\nobject in view. So highly developed in him were these social gifts,\r\nthrough the power of cultivation, that he could convince his unhappy\r\nvictims that he was actuated with a single purpose for their welfare.\r\n\r\nBy practicing in this way on the credulity of certain people, Ward\r\nmanaged to get into his hands, for his own personal use, sums of money\r\naggregating millions. Some of the richest financiers became his victims,\r\nchiefly induced by promises of high rates of interest and large profits\r\non various ventures.\r\n\r\nWard would ascertain the names and circumstances of certain people who\r\nhad large balances in their banks and were unable to make satisfactory\r\nand paying investments with them. He would bring certain influences to\r\nbear upon them to take their money out of the bank and invest it through\r\nhim in “Government contracts,” which he said afforded immense returns,\r\nbut were of a delicate character, and required some secrecy in the\r\nmanipulation. This circumstance naturally prevented him from going into\r\nan explanation of the details of the enterprise, which it was not\r\nnecessary for the investors to know when their profits were secured\r\nthrough such a stable investment. It was sufficient for them to be\r\nassured that the returns would be very large.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the successful manner in which Ward’s specious\r\npretences worked, I will relate the experience of one gentleman\r\nwho deposited $50,000 with him, on the strength of these\r\nrepresentations—just as an experiment.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was going on a trip to Europe and he left the amount\r\nstated in the possession of Mr. Ward to be used to the best possible\r\nadvantage during his absence, and invested in his own way.\r\n\r\nAbout six months after the date of this deposit, the gentleman returned\r\nfrom Europe and called at the office of Grant & Ward to learn what\r\nprogress had been made with his investment. He saw Ward, and called his\r\nattention to the fact.\r\n\r\nThe young Napoleon of finance recollected the appearance of his customer\r\nat a glance, for he is admirably developed in what phrenologists term\r\nindividuality, and never forgets a face, but in the immense rush of his\r\nspeculative business he had forgotten the circumstance until he referred\r\nto his books. He was but a few minutes absent in the interior office\r\nwhen he returned and informed the gentleman that his $50,000 had been\r\ninvested with the ordinary turn of luck that usually accrued under his\r\nmanagement, and he was very happy to be able to hand him a check for\r\n$250,000, after deducting the ordinary commission, as the result of the\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThe man was overpowered with this unexpected turn of luck, and the\r\nenormous profits taxed his credulity to its utmost capacity. This was a\r\nspeculative mine that he had never dreamed of, and instead of sleeping\r\nany that night he set his entire mind to calculate the profits on\r\n$250,000 in the same ratio that his $50,000 investment had been\r\ntransformed into this amount.\r\n\r\nIt required very little mathematical knowledge to arrive at the\r\nconclusion that with such another turn of speculative prosperity, he\r\nwould, within the next six months, be a millionaire and have the\r\noriginal investment left intact. Then if he should make this on three\r\nturns, which seemed not unlikely, when he should be present to look\r\nafter his own business, he might pile up millions by the dozen.\r\n\r\nThe mind of this fortunate speculator being filled with such thoughts as\r\nthese, he lost no time after breakfast in taking the train on the\r\nelevated road and arrived at Ward’s office before business had begun.\r\nWhen Ward arrived he met his customer with a gracious smile, took the\r\ncheck in the most handsome manner and made a note of it in his book.\r\n\r\nThe investor had not very long to wait this time before he knew the\r\nresult of his venture. It was only a few days prior to the 12th of May,\r\n1884, at which date the failures of Grant & Ward and the Marine Bank\r\nwere announced in Wall Street, as the _avant courier_ of a sudden panic.\r\nSo, the only thing that interfered with the second check producing\r\nsimilar results to those of the first, was the unfortunate panic, but of\r\ncourse Mr. Ward could tell his customer that he was not responsible for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIn this connection an important financial question arises. Would there\r\nhave been any panic had it not been for Ward, Fish, Eno & Co.? However\r\nthis may be, there is one thing very evident, namely, that Mr. Ward must\r\nbe accorded the power of ability to control men with whom he came in\r\ncontact in a remarkable manner, and of being able to get the best of\r\nthem in all financial matters. Old and astute financiers, who were\r\nconsidered experts in every method of speculation, and who knew all the\r\nartifices of making a sharp bargain, became helpless in the mystical\r\npresence of Ward, and were completely non-plussed by his superior acumen\r\nin taking advantage of every situation that offered the least\r\nopportunity of practicing his peculiar methods of chicanery and fraud.\r\n\r\nWard seems to have been very much of a mind reader. He knew when he\r\npassed that check over to the gentleman referred to, for $250,000, that\r\nit would come back again, that it would keep burning that man’s pocket\r\nwhile he kept it there, and that sooner or later he was bound to return\r\nit to the mysterious place of its issue. Doubtless this was not the\r\nfirst case that Ward had experimented upon in this way. He had evidently\r\nmade a regular practice of it, and could calculate the proportion of his\r\nvictims with as much accuracy as tables of mortality are made out for\r\ninsurance companies. There was no blind chance about Ferdinand’s\r\nmethods. He worked according to a rule, having calculated to a nicety\r\nthe exceptions that proved it, and his success showed that he had not\r\nwasted much time over stubborn cases.\r\n\r\nWard displayed marvellous tact in discovering, at a glance, those who\r\nwere sufficiently credulous to be entrapped into acquiescence with his\r\nschemes, and manifested great executive ability in pouncing upon his\r\nprey at the proper moment. His methods of operation were admirably\r\nsuited to his purposes. He saw, for instance, that this man would not\r\nput the money in any other kind of investment, and would not be likely\r\nto operate, except through Ward himself, as no other man could be found\r\nanywhere who could make himself the instrument of realizing such\r\nstupendous returns for the money invested.\r\n\r\nIt is marvellous how the idea of large profits, when presented to the\r\nmind in a plausible light, has the effect of stifling suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe specious pretexts of Ward appeared equal to the task of overcoming\r\nthe most obdurate cases of incredulity. So, it is not so singular, after\r\nall, that men utterly unacquainted with business methods and sharp\r\npractice in speculation, were so easily victimized by the sinister\r\nmethods, conciliatory manners and seductive schemes of this consummate\r\nimposter.\r\n\r\nWard was so successful in his arts of persuasion that he could not only\r\nsucceed in getting possession of all the available capital, for his own\r\npractical use, of many eminent financiers, but he had the power of\r\ntransforming them into walking advertisements for the promotion of his\r\nnefarious designs, and turned them to the best account in drumming up\r\nbusiness and customers for him while they were blissfully ignorant that\r\nthey were all the time the subservient mediums of swindling projects. In\r\nfact, they made themselves the willing instruments of “roping” in others\r\nfor Ward’s purposes, inspired by the purest motives of gratitude toward\r\nhim as their confidential broker and benefactor.\r\n\r\nIn this way General Grant and his sons became the helpless victims of\r\nWard’s deeply designing duplicity.\r\n\r\nPeople who have blamed General Grant fail to reflect on the fact that\r\nthe famous soldier and able tactician was no better than a raw recruit\r\nin the hands of a disciplined warrior when he was placed in contact with\r\nFerdinand Ward’s superior financial tactics.\r\n\r\nOne great point in the confidence game worked on joint account between\r\nFish and Ward was to obtain men of well known reputation to vouch for\r\nthe genuineness of the enterprises in which they were engaged. This\r\nenabled them to solidify and extend their credit. It was for this\r\npurpose that General Grant was inveigled into signing the well-known\r\nletter No. 2, addressed to Fish, which has been the subject of so much\r\ncriticism and comment. Following is a copy of this letter:\r\n\r\n                                                No. 2 Wall Street, }\r\n                                                Room 6,            }\r\n                                             NEW YORK, July 6, 1882.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. FISH:—In relation to the matter of discounts, kindly\r\n    made by you for account of Grant & Ward, I would say that I\r\n    think the investments are safe, and I am willing that Mr. Ward\r\n    should derive what profit he can for the firm that the use of my\r\n    name and influence may bring.\r\n\r\n                                            Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                 U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nThis letter was written in answer to one from Jas. D. Fish, President of\r\nthe Marine Bank, saying he had negotiated notes for the benefit of Grant\r\n& Ward, to the amount of $200,000. He said in explanation: “Those notes,\r\nas I understand it, are given for no other purpose than to raise money\r\nfor the payment of grain, &c., to fill the Government contracts.”\r\n\r\nThis letter, signed by General Grant was designated by his counsel as\r\n“only an ordinary letter in the course of business,” and that is all it\r\nis where a man placed confidence in another as General Grant did in Ward\r\nand Fish.\r\n\r\nIt was Ward who wrote the letter, through the instruction of Fish, and\r\ngot General Grant to sign it.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with a reporter of the New York _World_, in July last,\r\nWard explained the circumstances under which the letter was signed, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Do you know anything about that letter addressed to Mr. Fish\r\n    and signed by Gen. Grant, regarding the Government contracts?”\r\n    asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n    “Of course I do,” quickly replied Ward. “I made the original\r\n    draft. It was by Mr. Fish’s direction, and he asked me to do it,\r\n    suggesting what I should write. He had had some trouble in\r\n    getting Grant & Ward’s paper discounted, for he attended to that\r\n    and raised millions of dollars. He wanted something to show to\r\n    Mr. Cox, President of the Mechanic’s Bank, and others from whom\r\n    he tried to get money for the firm. The contract business was\r\n    the great thing, and he said if he only had something from the\r\n    General to show that he knew about the contracts, it would be\r\n    easier for him to go to these men. I distinctly remember the\r\n    circumstances under which this letter was prepared. Fish gave me\r\n    an idea what it ought to be like and I wrote it. Then Mr. Fish\r\n    went over it and made some corrections in his own handwriting.\r\n    It was scrawled on a piece of paper that happened to be handy in\r\n    the office, and after he had it to suit him he handed it to me\r\n    and I gave it to Spencer, our cashier, to copy. I am not sure\r\n    but that I have got that draft somewhere among my papers. I\r\n    think I have seen it since the failure, and if it is still in\r\n    existence it can plainly be seen that Mr. Fish knew all about it\r\n    before it received Gen. Grant’s signature. The General was in\r\n    the habit of signing papers I asked him to without paying much\r\n    attention to what they were. So when I asked him to sign this\r\n    one he did so without much if any questioning. I understood well\r\n    enough what Fish wanted it for, because he told me, and I have\r\n    no doubt that Mr. Cox and other gentlemen from whom he borrowed\r\n    money saw the letter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                HENRY N. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MR. SMITH STARTED IN LIFE AND BECAME A SUCCESSFUL OPERATOR.—HIS\r\n    CONNECTION WITH THE TWEED “RING,” AND HOW HE AND THE FAMOUS “BOSS”\r\n    MADE LUCKY SPECULATIONS, THROUGH THE USE OF THE CITY FUNDS, IN\r\n    MAKING A TIGHT MONEY MARKET.—ON THE VERGE OF RUIN IN A POOL WITH W.\r\n    K. VANDERBILT.—HE IS CONVERTED TO THE BEAR SIDE BY WOERISHOFFER, AND\r\n    AGAIN MAKES MONEY, BUT BY PERSISTENCE IN HIS BEARISH POLICY RUINS\r\n    HIMSELF AND DRAGS WM. HEATH & CO. DOWN ALSO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already had occasion to speak of Henry N. Smith, who was a member\r\nof the firm of Smith, Gould & Martin, but I consider him of sufficient\r\nimportance, speculatively speaking, for a separate biographical sketch.\r\npi This gentleman is a native of Buffalo, and had been in the mercantile\r\nbusiness there before coming to Wall Street. He was familiarly known as\r\nthe young man from Buffalo. He had then a decidedly Hebrew aspect; was a\r\nstrawberry blonde, with full beard of auburn hue, sharp, piercing eyes,\r\nand an air of self-confidence. He had made some money in Buffalo, and\r\nwas lucky in his first ventures in Wall Street, being one of the few who\r\nemerged from the panic of 1864 on the winning side. Smith became a bold\r\noperator, and accumulated considerable money. He was invariably\r\nsuccessful in his transactions whenever he was governed by his own\r\njudgment. The first disaster overtook him in the panic of 1873.\r\nImmediately prior to that he had been under the influence of Commodore\r\nVanderbilt, who put him into Western Union, and the loss which he\r\nsustained by its terrible fall in that year almost ruined him. He lost\r\nall his ready money, being left without anything but his New York\r\nresidence and a stock farm.\r\n\r\nHe did not lose courage, however, by this speculative blow, but picked\r\nhimself up again and soon became quite a power in the Street, and in\r\nspite of the ups and downs of speculation and the various panics, Smith\r\nkept clearly ahead of the market for many years, and became a successful\r\nand comparatively wealthy operator.\r\n\r\nHe always managed to ingratiate himself with wealthy connections in his\r\nvarious operations, and was able to command an enormous amount of credit\r\nin comparison with his actual means.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, on his return from Europe, he met W. K. Vanderbilt, and\r\nthey began to discuss the probable future of the market. Vanderbilt had\r\nbeen a bull for some time previously. They entered into an agreement to\r\noperate on the bull side together. The result was that Vanderbilt lost\r\nseveral millions, and came pretty near running the risk of exhausting a\r\nlarge part of his then anticipated share of his father’s estate. The\r\ndeal was disastrous to Smith also.\r\n\r\nSoon after this discomfiture, one day, on his way to Long Branch, Mr.\r\nSmith met the late Mr. Woerishoffer, who was the great bear on the\r\nmarket, while Smith and Vanderbilt were still then the leading bulls.\r\nWoerishoffer succeeded in convincing Smith that his position on the\r\nmarket was wrong—that he had better make a clean sweep of it in selling\r\nout the stocks which he held, and join hands with him on the bear side.\r\n\r\nSmith was impressed with Woerishoffer’s advice, earnestness and\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nThe great bear was also in a position to back up his theory by examples\r\nof his success, the best and most convincing argument that could\r\npossibly be employed, especially by a Wall Street speculator. As the\r\nresult of this bearish counsel, Smith soon recuperated from the effect\r\nof his former losses, and, in consequence, got bearish notions so badly\r\non the brain that he was prepared to swear by Woerishoffer’s judgment,\r\nand considered his own equally infallible. He could see nothing but\r\ndisaster ahead any more than his general, and was recklessly prepared to\r\nfollow wherever the champion bear should lead in the destruction of\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nSmith seemed to have the same abiding faith in Woerishoffer that\r\nIgnatius Loyola reposed in the Pope of his day. “If the Holy Father,”\r\nsaid that eminent Jesuit, “should command me to row several leagues into\r\nthe ocean in an open boat, in the midst of a terrific gale, I should\r\nstraightway obey his mandate without asking why or wherefore.”\r\n\r\nSuch is hardly an exaggerated illustration of the thorough appreciation\r\nwhich Smith entertained of the perfection of Woerishoffer’s bearish\r\ndiscipline, and the exact certitude of his judgment in all matters of a\r\nspeculative character. It is almost impossible for a man who has had no\r\nexperience in Wall Street matters to estimate the extremes of fanaticism\r\nin speculation to which a man is prepared to go when he is seized with a\r\nmonomania either on the bull or the bear side, but especially on the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of his senses counts for nothing, and the evidence of other\r\npeople’s senses, if possible, goes for less. He is a consistent bull or\r\nbear, as the case may be, and that settles it. He is Sir Oracle on the\r\nstock market and when he speaks let no dog bark.\r\n\r\nThis inveterate combination of egotism and fanaticism has ruined many\r\nhundreds, to my own knowledge. The disease is contagious, and Smith had\r\na very obstinate form of it. His symptoms were even worse than those of\r\nWoerishoffer, by whom he was smitten, a peculiarity that very often\r\noccurs in the recipient of this financial malady.\r\n\r\nLike Woerishoffer, Smith fought the market with desperation on every\r\nadvance. He adhered steadily to the policy of attacking prices on every\r\nrally during the summer of 1885, while values were constantly advancing,\r\nwith occasional healthy reactions. When his own money was exhausted he\r\nbegan to incur cumulative liabilities with the house of Wm. Heath & Co.,\r\nuntil that famous firm had become almost depleted of its available\r\nresources in replacing margins as fast as they were wiped out by the\r\npersistent tide of advancing prices in speculation.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Smith proceeded, in obedience to the spirit of bearish\r\nfanaticism, until his loss became so great that he not only had to pay\r\nout all his own money, but was in debt to the firm of Wm. Heath & Co. in\r\na million dollars, which was the cause of their failure, and which\r\ncrippled or caused to collapse several smaller houses.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Smith appeared before the Governing Committee of the Stock\r\nExchange to make application for the extension of time on his seat, he\r\nmade the following extraordinary statement: “On January 1, 1885, I was\r\nworth $1,400,000. I had $1,100,000 in money, and the balance, $300,000,\r\nin good real estate. On the following January I had lost the whole\r\namount, and was $1,200,000 in debt, a million of which I owed to Wm.\r\nHeath & Co.”\r\n\r\nMany people were surprised that Mr. Smith was enabled to obtain such an\r\nenormous and unlimited amount of credit in one house. I took the ground\r\nat the time, and I am still of the same opinion, that the animal\r\nmagnetism or psychologic power of Henry N. Smith over the elder Heath\r\nwas the real cause of all the trouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Heath had been in bad health for some time, consequently he left the\r\ngeneral management of the business to Mr. McCanless, the head clerk and\r\ngeneral manager of the firm, through whom the orders of Mr. Heath were\r\nstrictly executed.\r\n\r\nMr. Heath being weak in both body and mind, yielded his opinions to\r\nthose of Mr. Smith, by virtue of the superior mental force of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIn conducting a large Wall Street business it is necessary that a man\r\nshould have the mental stamina to say “no” firmly, and stand to it. In\r\norder to be able to do this he must be backed up by a vigorous, healthy\r\nphysique.\r\n\r\nThe power to utter a negative in a determined manner requires,\r\ngenerally, a fair degree of physical force, and it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to the success of a Wall Street broker that he should be able\r\nto do it when occasion requires. A deficiency either in will power or\r\nphysical force to pronounce this small negative distinctly and firmly\r\nmay result in financial ruin, as it did in the case of Wm. Heath & Co.\r\n\r\nHenry Nelson Smith made many successful turns in speculation during the\r\nTweed regime, owing to the facilities which the municipal bankers\r\nbelonging to that famous coterie afforded him for manipulating the money\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThere were great fluctuations in stocks while William Marcy Tweed was\r\nthe power behind the throne in the government of the city of New York.\r\nMr. Tweed contributed largely towards these fluctuations. He and his\r\ntrusty companions pulled the wires at the City Hall while the puppets in\r\nseveral of the brokers’ offices in the vicinity of Wall Street danced to\r\nthe sweet will of the managers in the municipal building.\r\n\r\nOne of Tweed’s three famous maxims was, “The way to have power is to\r\ntake it.” The other two were, “He is human,” and “What are you going to\r\ndo about it?” In conformity with the first maxim, Mr. Tweed took control\r\nof the city funds, besides a number of the city savings banks, and other\r\nfinancial institutions, which he had organized through special charters\r\nfrom the Legislature, which he also owned during the period of his\r\nBoss-ship.\r\n\r\nThese funds were so managed that a very tight squeeze could, at almost\r\nany time, be effected in the money market. The city funds on hand were,\r\nat that time, usually about from six to eight millions of dollars, and\r\nwere deposited in the banking institutions of the “Boss.” They were\r\nostensibly under the control of the City Chamberlain, who was under the\r\ncontrol of Tweed.\r\n\r\nHenry N. Smith and a few other favorite members of the syndicate would\r\ndraw their balances from these banks, making money scarce to the general\r\npublic, and the money market would suffer a sudden squeeze, and\r\nconsequently the stock market would break, sometimes with such rapidity\r\nas to produce disastrous results to a number of brokers, business houses\r\nand other financial concerns outside the Tweed Ring.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions Mr. Smith drove up to the Tenth National Bank,\r\nthe Black Friday ring institution, in a cab, and drew his balance\r\ntherefrom, amounting to $4,100,000. He took it home and kept it there\r\nseveral days under lock and key. In the meantime Mr. Tweed and his\r\ncompanions withdrew from circulation the greater portion of the amount\r\nunder their immediate control, making a tie-up, on the whole, of nearly\r\ntwenty millions of dollars. At that time this was an amount sufficient\r\nto make a very stringent money market, and cause Wall Street operators\r\nto feel very uncomfortable. It was then a mighty power to be wielded by\r\na few unscrupulous men. At that time Mr. Smith considered himself worth\r\nat least five million dollars. He lost most of this in the panic of\r\n1873, largely in Western Union stock, as above stated, into which\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt had kindly put him.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the prominent part which Mr. Smith played in the\r\ngreat speculative drama of Black Friday, in the scenes and incidents of\r\nmy chapter on that ever-to-be-remembered day in Wall Street\r\n\r\nI shall, in another chapter, briefly review some of the methods to which\r\nthe Tweed Ring resorted to make speculation and politics play into each\r\nother’s hands, and show how a bold attempt was made to add the control\r\nof the National Treasury to that of New York.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                KEENE’S CAREER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHE STARTS IN SPECULATION AS A CALIFORNIA BROKER.—A LUCKY HIT IN A MINING\r\n    STOCK PUTS HIM ON THE ROAD TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.—HIS SPECULATIVE\r\n    ENCOUNTER WITH THE BONANZA KINGS.—HE MAKES FOUR MILLIONS, STARTS FOR\r\n    EUROPE AND STOPS AT WALL STREET, WHERE HE FORMS AN ALLIANCE WITH\r\n    GOULD, WHO “EUCHRES” HIM AND OTHERS.—SELOVER DROPS GOULD IN AN AREA\r\n    WAY.—KEENE GOES ALONE AND ADDS NINE MILLIONS MORE TO HIS FORTUNE.—HE\r\n    THEN SPECULATES RECKLESSLY IN EVERYTHING.—SUFFERS A SUDDEN REVERSAL\r\n    AND GETS SWAMPED.—OVERWHELMING DISASTER IN A BEAR CAMPAIGN, LED BY\r\n    GOULD AND CAMMACK, IN WHICH KEENE LOSES SEVEN MILLIONS.—HIS\r\n    DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO RECOVER A PART ENTAIL FURTHER LOSSES, AND HE\r\n    APPROACHES THE END OF HIS THIRTEEN MILLIONS.—HIS PRINCELY LIBERALITY\r\n    AND SOCIAL RELATIONS WITH SAM WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable up-and-down lives known to Wall Street is\r\nthat of James R. Keene. His rise and fall are both of recent date.\r\n\r\nMr. Keene is of English parentage, and was born in London, about 48\r\nyears ago. He came to this country at the age of 17, lived in the South\r\nand studied law there. He removed to San Francisco in 1853, and became\r\nwell informed in mining matters through several mining cases that were\r\nput into his hands while practising at the bar in that city. I am told\r\nhe was also connected with a Western newspaper for some time. He caught\r\nthe speculative fever shortly after his arrival in California, and, as\r\nit seems, abandoned both law and journalism to become a broker.\r\n\r\nKeene had hard work for some time to make both ends meet, and his\r\nstruggle for existence in the wild West made serious inroads on his\r\nhealth. His physician told him he must give up work, and advised him to\r\ntake a long sea voyage if he intended to prolong his life. Acting on\r\nthis advice, he secured his passage to the East. This was the turning\r\npoint in both his health and fortune.\r\n\r\nPrior to his departure, Mr. Keene was urged to invest a few hundred\r\ndollars in a mining stock then selling very low. The length of his\r\njourney and the change of scene caused him almost to forget about his\r\ninvestment, and the methods of communication between the far West and\r\nthe far East in those days were so very slow that he had hardly any\r\nchance of being informed of his lucky venture until his return. As an\r\nillustration of this slow transit of news at that time, it may be stated\r\nthat gold was discovered January 19, 1848, but the news did not reach\r\nthe Eastern States until the following December. It was authoritatively\r\nannounced in the President’s annual message, and created great\r\nexcitement. Mr. Alfred Robinson, with about twenty companions, were the\r\nfirst to leave New York for the scene of the new El Dorado, on the bark\r\n“John Benton.”\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a year’s absence Keene was surprised to find, on his\r\nreturn, that mining stocks had taken a prodigious bound upward and\r\ncarried the one in which he had invested with them. The mine had turned\r\nout to be a veritable bonanza, and the stock which had cost him only a\r\nfew hundred dollars was then worth over $200,000.\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Keene’s health not required his absence from the scene of\r\nspeculation the chances are that he would have disposed of his stock as\r\nsoon as it should have realized a few thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThis was a wonderful realization for one who had been comparatively\r\npoor, and was sufficient to turn the head of any ordinary man; but it\r\nonly made Keene more anxious for greater success, which he set himself\r\ndiligently to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe speculative craze was then intense and epidemic. Waiters and\r\nchambermaids bloomed into millionaires with the rapidity of mushroom\r\ngrowth. Mr. Keene secured a seat in the Board, and began to do an\r\nimmense business.\r\n\r\nFlood, Mackay, Fair and O’Brien were then the prominent operators. The\r\nspeculative contagion spread rapidly over the coast, and soon imparted\r\nits influence to the entire continent. Keene’s further investments were\r\ncrowned with similar success to that of his first venture, and even in a\r\ngreater ratio of profit.\r\n\r\nSeeing the great and rapid advance in the stocks of the Comstock mines,\r\nhe naturally reasoned, like old Daniel Drew, that what had gone up so\r\nhigh and so fast was bound to come down. There were but few people on\r\nthe coast at that time, however, in a mood to reason so soberly, and it\r\nrequired more than ordinary nerve to make the experiment of selling\r\n“short.” Mr. Keene, however, had the courage of his convictions, and\r\nmade an onslaught upon the market.\r\n\r\nThere Was a strong contingent to oppose him, for the wealthy syndicate\r\njust named, with the Bank of California behind them, were his bitter\r\nfoes, and they did their best to crush him. In spite of their efforts,\r\nhowever, the market began to yield under the pressure of Keene’s “short”\r\nsales. In a little while the list gave way and stocks began to topple\r\nfrom their dizzy eminence, even quicker than they had climbed to that\r\nunprecedented height. Keene netted millions in their fall. He cleared\r\ntwo and a-half millions in the Belcher and Crown Point mines, and over\r\nhalf a million in Ophir.\r\n\r\nSo, in a few years, this poor lawyer, journalist, curbstone broker and\r\ninvalid, found himself the happy possessor of millions, his name covered\r\nwith speculative glory, and the fame of his fabulous fortune heralded in\r\nevery city, town, hamlet and mining camp between the two oceans.\r\n\r\nKeene was still found on the right side of the market when the great\r\nbubble burst, when the Bank of California went under, and its president,\r\nMr. Ralston, committed suicide while pretending to take a bath in the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mr. Keene started on a voyage for Europe for the good of his\r\nhealth, and made a friendly call in Wall Street to see how business was\r\ntransacted there. He found the speculative attraction irresistible.\r\nMahomet had come to the mountain and was held by its magnetic power.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Keene had been a grand success in California, he had a good\r\ndeal to learn when he came to Wall Street. He soon discovered that\r\nCalifornia tactics would not do here. He began to sell “short,” but\r\nfound the market failed to yield to the touch of his bearish wand as it\r\nhad done in San Francisco. When he sold ten thousand shares of a certain\r\nstock the decline, instead of being a slump, as he expected, was only an\r\ninsignificant fraction, and the market soon reacted. Mr. Keene quickly\r\ndiscovered that he was throwing water into a sieve, and stopped\r\nsacrificing his California gold so lavishly.\r\n\r\nA pool was then formed by Mr. Keene and Jay Gould to put down Western\r\nUnion. Keene and Selover sold the stock in large blocks, but it was\r\nabsorbed by some party or parties unknown as fast as it was thrown out.\r\nIt was gravely suspected that Mr. Gould was the wicked partner who was\r\nplaying this absorbing game behind the scenes. Major Selover brooded\r\nover the matter so seriously that his suspicions began to take tangible\r\nform and “body themselves forth” in violence.\r\n\r\nThe Major and Keene met one morning at the rear entrance of the Stock\r\nExchange, in New street, and interchanged intelligent glances on the\r\nsubject, after the fashion of those passed between Bill Nye and his\r\ncompanion at the card table with the Heathen Chinee. Selover walked down\r\nthe street with blood in his eye, and meeting Mr. Gould on the corner of\r\nNew street and Exchange Place, caught him up by the collar of the coat\r\nand a part of his pants and dropped him in the area way of a barber’s\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThe little man promptly picked himself up, went quietly to his office,\r\nand made a transaction by which Selover lost $15,000 more. This was his\r\nmethod of retaliation.\r\n\r\nMr. Keene next went into the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph pool, and\r\nwas again fortunate. It has been frequently asserted that he lost\r\nheavily in this deal, but I have it on good authority that he came out\r\nahead. In the deal with Gould in Western Union, he and Gould netted on\r\njoint account $1,300,000. It is popularly believed that Gould “euchred”\r\nKeene in this pool, but these are the bare facts.\r\n\r\nKeene looked over the speculative field, and found that there had been\r\ngreat depreciation in values prevailing here since the panic of 1873. He\r\nhad arrived in the nick of time to take advantage of the situation. He\r\nwas backed by four millions of money, and the few losses which he at\r\nfirst sustained were not felt by him, and only seemed to initiate him\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nThis new blood was just what Wall Street then wanted to put the wheels\r\nof speculation in motion. Mr. Keene informed himself about the principal\r\nstocks dealt in at the Exchange. He did so with remarkable rapidity.\r\nThey were all down to panic prices, and seeing that most of them were\r\nintrinsically cheap, he bought heavily. Soon the turn came which\r\nresulted in the high tide of speculation which continued with but slight\r\nreactions all through 1879-80.\r\n\r\nThe advance was immense, as can be seen in the tabular statement at the\r\nend of this book, and the profits were enormous.\r\n\r\nKeene’s millions were doubled and trebled. He must have felt himself a\r\nmodern Crœsus.\r\n\r\nFully nine millions were added to the four which he brought from\r\nCalifornia. He stood in the centre of that great pile, figuratively\r\nspeaking, the cynosure of all eyes from Maine to California, and his\r\nfame was noised abroad in Europe.\r\n\r\nGould and other old speculators began to grow green with envy at Keene’s\r\nunprecedented success. He seemed likely to exceed the wildest dreams\r\nthat ever the avarice of Monte Cristo or Daniel Drew had conjured up,\r\nand with him the imaginary profits of Col. Sellers had become material\r\nrealities. His investments were nearly all in good, reliable securities.\r\nNo dubious paper acceptances nor rotten railroad items were mixed up\r\nwith his tangible fortune, which was without parallel in Wall Street for\r\nits size and rapidity of accumulation.\r\n\r\nThe history of speculation was ransacked in vain for an illustration of\r\nsuch amazing success in so short a period. But here, I regret to say,\r\nthis marvellous prosperity ends.\r\n\r\nIn an evil hour Mr. Keene was induced to spread himself out all over\r\ncreation, while he still retained his immense interest in stocks. He was\r\nso flushed with successive victories that he began to regard failure\r\nimpossible, and thought he was a man of destiny in speculation, such as\r\nNapoleon considered himself in war. He speculated in everything that\r\ncame along—in wheat, lard, opium and fast horses.\r\n\r\nKeene’s attempt to get a corner in all the grain in the country,\r\nhowever, was a signal failure. The very week that Foxhall won the Grand\r\nPrix in Paris he himself was sadly beaten in the speculative race by the\r\nsteady going farmers of the West, who sent their wheat to market quicker\r\nthan he could purchase it with his thirteen million dollars, and all the\r\ncredit which that implied.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, reversal in the tide of speculation set in. Mr. Cammack\r\nwas quick to perceive that Mr. Keene was extending his lines and his\r\nventures. He had a conversation with Mr. Gould. They became convinced\r\nthat the Californian must soon be obliged to leave some of his\r\nenterprises in a weak and unguarded position. It was impossible that he\r\ncould take care of them all. These two champion bears united their\r\nefforts to upset the market, and each day brought additional force to\r\ntheir aid. By dint of perseverance their efforts commenced to bear\r\nfruit, and it was apparent that they would soon be rewarded with\r\nsuccess. The bears began to multiply while the bulls diminished, and the\r\nremnant of the latter that were left were anything but rampant at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe bankers became timid. The brokers were inspired with the same spirit\r\nand were still calling out for more margin. Loans were called in as a\r\npart of the programme of a bear campaign, and all the machinery of\r\ndepression was put in active motion. Prices were torn to pieces.\r\nProperties that had been considered good as solid investments for a long\r\nturn, were mercilessly raided, and some of them shattered to fragments.\r\nIn fact, there was a regular panic. In the general slaughter, many of\r\nthe brokers sold Mr. Keene’s stocks out. His wheat was also sold in\r\nimmense quantities at great sacrifice, and his load was lightened all\r\naround, even more quickly than it had been heaped up.\r\n\r\nHis losses are said to have amounted to seven millions of dollars at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nThe manly efforts of Mr. Keene to recover these losses, as is usually\r\nthe case in such instances, only resulted in further misfortune.\r\nDisaster followed disaster, and as he became desperate in his efforts to\r\nget back something, his losses became constantly greater, until nearly\r\nthe whole of his immense pile was buried in fruitless efforts to recover\r\na portion of it.\r\n\r\nGreat sympathy has been felt in Wall Street for Keene since his failure,\r\nfor the Street had never before found such a liberal man. By general\r\nconsent he decidedly took the palm in this respect, not only from all\r\nhis speculative contemporaries, but the archives of Wall Street since\r\nthe days of the first meetings of the brokers in the Tontine Coffee\r\nHouse, opposite the sycamore tree, early in the century, can furnish no\r\nsuch parallel of princely liberality as that of James R. Keene during\r\nthe period of his matchless prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe parasites that waxed fat on his bounty and business are numerous. At\r\nleast a score of Wall Street brokers were raised from penury to wealth\r\nby the commissions which they made out of him. Many of them are to-day\r\nliving in luxury who started with a desk and a few plain office chairs\r\nto do business for the California millionaire, and now he is\r\ncomparatively poor, and thrown on the slender resources of his wife.\r\n\r\nKeene arose from nil to be worth thirteen millions. He is now back where\r\nhe started.\r\n\r\nA full and correct history of Keene’s beneficences would fill this\r\nvolume, and however much I admire him, I cannot afford to give him so\r\nmuch space.\r\n\r\nI shall relate one remarkable instance of his unbounded generosity,\r\nhowever, as the object has been so universally known, and was himself\r\nsuch a popular society man.\r\n\r\nLong prior to Mr. Keene’s advent in Wall Street, Sam Ward had been a\r\nconspicuous figure in Washington and Wall Street, and had acquired a\r\nsociety reputation in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was originally forced into prominence by his marriage\r\nwith Miss Astor.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward had changed from one thing to another until finally he took up\r\nhis abode in Washington, and became a lobbyist.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Keene came to New York with his four millions of dollars, which\r\nhe had made when the majority of New York investors had been on the\r\nlosing side, dropping their money almost as fast as water runs down\r\nhill, through the unprecedented shrinkage in values, there was a wide\r\nfield for profitable investment. This shrinkage had been going on from\r\nthe panic of 1873, step by step downward until 1878, when society had\r\nreached a stratum by dint of levelling down that placed almost everybody\r\nupon an equality. Property, in many instances, became a serious\r\nencumbrance instead of a benefit, and many were glad to be rid of the\r\nresponsibility of their holdings for what was sufficient to settle the\r\nmortgage. Everybody felt poor, and was really so, with a few fortunate\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nMr. Keene arrived here at the most fortunate moment for investment.\r\nEverything was down to bed-rock prices. He, therefore, became an object\r\nof actual curiosity, and was as much of a lion in our midst as he had\r\nbeen in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nHe was not only the favorite of fortune, but a favorite of society,\r\nwhich generally go together with curious inconsistency in our social\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acquaintances Mr. Keene made on his arrival was this\r\ngreat society man, the celebrated Sam Ward, who at once recognized his\r\nsocial worth, not only in dollars and cents, but in considerable\r\nliabilities, genuine representatives of dollars and cents. The more\r\ntangibly he realized this fact the more tenacious was his attachment,\r\nuntil Mr. Keene found Mr. Ward the very _beau ideal_ of Scriptural\r\nfraternity, namely, “a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”\r\n\r\nWherever Keene appeared, though apparently alone, it was safe to bet\r\nthat Ward’s shadow could soon be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Seneca, when he observed a house falling, and nobody near\r\nit, that he asked: “Where is the woman?” So Keene’s presence naturally\r\nsuggested Ward to the mental vision of every Wall Street man and every\r\nsporting man.\r\n\r\nWhether it was up-town or down-town, at Newport, or in London, at the\r\nDerby, or the Grand Prix, it was all the same, where Keene was, there\r\nWard soon appeared with the promptitude of the genius that stood before\r\nAladdin when he touched his wonderful lamp or rubbed his magic ring.\r\n\r\nThis self-sacrificing friendship and ardent devotion on the part of Mr.\r\nWard was recognized by Mr. Keene in the most tangible manner. He made an\r\ninvestment for his protege, of $50,000 in solid securities, placing them\r\nin the hands of trustees, so that his ward received the income therefrom\r\nof three thousand dollars, as an annuity, for life.\r\n\r\nMr. Keene bestowed numerous benefits on other newly made acquaintances,\r\nof which this is a fair sample.\r\n\r\nA Pacific coast biographer draws the following graphic sketch of Keene,\r\nsome time after his departure from California, which is curious reading\r\nin the light of the events which I have related:\r\n\r\n    “No series of sketches of men, prominently identified with the\r\n    stock interests of the Pacific coast, would be complete without\r\n    a pen portrait of James R. Keene, the free lance operator of the\r\n    San Francisco stock market, who dared to beard the Bonanza Kings\r\n    in their den, and came off victorious with many shekels of gold\r\n    and silver. Mr. Keene is no longer with us. Some time since,\r\n    after having realized largely on his stock ventures, he\r\n    concluded to take a trip East, to be extended to Europe, unless\r\n    on the Atlantic seashore he regained the health which too active\r\n    exertions on the Pacific had impaired. And so he went with his\r\n    family. Those who bade him God-speed expected to see him return\r\n    within a few months, certainly within a year, with recovered\r\n    health, new ambitions, new conquests to make. But he comes not.\r\n    New York has presented more attractions than his old love, San\r\n    Francisco. Railroad stocks, Jay Gould, Sam Ward, Rufus Hatch,\r\n    Long Branch, Trenor W. Park, Newport, have been too many\r\n    attractions for Jim Keene. He fell into the New York market as\r\n    easily as any man generally falls among thieves—but he seems to\r\n    have got the best of the thieves in every issue. When it was\r\n    rumored that Keene contemplated making Wall Street his\r\n    headquarters, his old San Francisco friends generally wrote out\r\n    their calendars, and figured up when ‘Jim’ would be back,\r\n    bursted out and out, looking for a job. A few who had abiding\r\n    faith in Keene, who knew his pluck, who had gauged his\r\n    capacities, who had measured his horse sense, consulted their\r\n    calendars and said: ‘Jim is gone! He never will come back to\r\n    couch his lance in such a narrow field as ours. New York is big,\r\n    Wall Street is big—just about the size of institutions that\r\n    Keene wants to tackle.’ The few were right. Keene hasn’t come\r\n    back to look for a job. He has tried conclusions with the\r\n    smartest of the Wall Street operators, and, novice that he was,\r\n    came out triumphant. The California goose that was to be plucked\r\n    wasn’t plucked. Even Jay Gould, with all his shrewdness, gave it\r\n    up as a bad job; and Vanderbilt condescends to confer with Keene\r\n    on momentous occasions.\r\n\r\n    “Keene started in his career as a stock operator years ago in\r\n    San Francisco. He first was conspicuous as an impulsive,\r\n    dare-devil sort of a street broker, acting for big firms, with\r\n    an occasional dash for liberty and himself. Gradually he worked\r\n    his way from steerage to cabin, from the private’s ranks to the\r\n    position of the lieutenant of the watch, then to officer of the\r\n    day, and finally, boss of the stock concern. No man in the stock\r\n    market exercised so much influence as Mr. Keene. He had hosts of\r\n    friends, friends whom he grappled with hooks of steel, ready to\r\n    swear by him on any and every occasion. Generous to a fault,\r\n    brusque in manner at times, but with the heart of a woman, ready\r\n    to melt at a moment’s notice, open-handed and open-hearted to\r\n    the appeal of even an acquaintance, no wonder that Jim Keene was\r\n    the ideal of the market.”\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that Keene was chiefly instrumental in\r\nrehabilitating the Bank of California after the death of Ralston. He\r\nraised a large subscription in the Stock Board, and got the Hon. William\r\nSharon, D. O. Mills and “Lucky” Baldwin to subscribe a million each, and\r\nhe put in a million himself. The bank was thus enabled to meet all\r\nimmediate demands, and a threatened panic was averted.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Keene’s failure he was chief of a syndicate which had\r\npurchased 25,000,000 bushels of wheat, which would soon have netted many\r\nmillion dollars of profit, if it had been firmly held, but one or two of\r\nhis partners in the pool became timid and sold out. The syndicate went\r\nto pieces, and both profits and capital vanished. He laid his misfortune\r\nmainly to the newspapers which raised such a universal cry about the\r\nimmense “corner” that was being manipulated in wheat, threatening a\r\nfamine in the great staple of human life.\r\n\r\nKeene was next shaken out of his stocks. This was done chiefly by an\r\nably concocted scheme of the bears, and he had the mortification of\r\nseeing the stocks which he had held advance within a few months’ time to\r\na point that would have enabled him to realize ten million dollars, if\r\nhe had been able to hold them.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n             OUR RAILROAD METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEPTIVE FINANCIERING.—OVER-CAPITALIZATION.—STOCK “WATERING.”—FINANCIAL\r\n    RECONSTRUCTIONS.—LOSSES TO THE PUBLIC.—PROFITS OF CONSTRUCTORS.—BAD\r\n    REPUTATION OF OUR RAILROAD SECURITIES.—UNJUST AND DANGEROUS\r\n    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PUBLIC WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following chapter, on the subject of “Our Railroad Methods,” was\r\ndelivered by me as a Fourth of July address at Mr. H. C. Bowen’s Annual\r\nSymposium at Woodstock, Conn., to an assemblage of over 3,000 people. It\r\nwas so favorably received by the press and the public in general, that I\r\nhave been encouraged to publish it in this book without any material\r\nchanges:\r\n\r\n    In the whole range of our law-making there is no one branch in\r\n    which there has been such an utter lack of judgment, foresight\r\n    and just regard for the rights of the citizen, as in the\r\n    legislation provided for our railroads and railroad companies.\r\n    For the most part, the statutes relating to this class of\r\n    corporations are a set of general enactments, loosely defining\r\n    the large powers granted to the incorporators, comparatively\r\n    silent on the duties and obligations of the companies to the\r\n    public, and conferring upon them a virtual _carte blanche_ as to\r\n    their methods of finance and of conducting their business.\r\n\r\n    In a country whose products are mainly bulky, and have to be\r\n    carried to markets hundreds or thousands of miles distant, it is\r\n    of the first moment that its railroads should be built with the\r\n    strictest economy and on the lowest possible capitalization. The\r\n    low cost of land and the cheapness of material for road-bed are\r\n    especially favorable to our securing this advantage; but the\r\n    laws have permitted a system of inflated financiering which\r\n    neutralizes these natural adaptations and immensely increases\r\n    the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\n    As railroads have to be largely built with borrowed money, their\r\n    construction in this country afforded an opportunity for\r\n    establishing credit relations with the great lending centres of\r\n    Europe, which might have been of incalculable value in promoting\r\n    the development of our vast resources in various directions.\r\n    England, Holland and Germany have indeed loaned us very large\r\n    amounts for railroad enterprises; but the law has permitted\r\n    these undertakings to be conducted with so much concealment,\r\n    misrepresentation and actual fraud, and has so disregarded the\r\n    rights of the bondholders, that American credit has become a\r\n    scandal and a by-word on the European bourses. The result is,\r\n    that foreign capitalists are seeking other fields of investment;\r\n    and their respective Governments are encouraging them by opening\r\n    up new colonies, and thus getting fresh sources for the supply\r\n    of products which otherwise would have continued to be readily\r\n    taken from the United States. Such are the rewards of immoral\r\n    financiering; and these bad methods are directly traceable to\r\n    the encouragements afforded by our negligently constructed\r\n    railroad laws.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps I may best succeed in making myself understood on this\r\n    subject by illustrating the way in which our railroads are\r\n    usually built. Under the laws of the State of New York—which are\r\n    a fair sample of the laws of most other States—a number of\r\n    persons form a company under the general railroad laws,\r\n    registering at Albany the proposed route of the road, the amount\r\n    of capital stock and bonds to be issued, and a few other\r\n    particulars required in the papers of incorporation. The\r\n    incorporators then proceed to form themselves into a syndicate\r\n    or company, for the purpose of contracting to build and equip\r\n    the road. Here comes the first step in the system of “crooked”\r\n    financiering. In their capacity of incorporators, the same men\r\n    make a contract with themselves, in the capacity of\r\n    constructors. Of course, they do not fail to make a bargain to\r\n    suit their own interests. They would be more than human if they\r\n    did. Usually, the bargain is that the construction company\r\n    undertakes to build the road for 80 to 100 per cent. of the face\r\n    value of the first mortgage bonds, with an equal amount of\r\n    stock, and sometimes also a certain amount of second mortgages\r\n    thrown in, virtually without consideration. The first mortgages\r\n    are supposed to represent the real cash outlay on the\r\n    construction and equipment; but, as a matter of fact, the true\r\n    cash cost of the work done and materials furnished ranges from\r\n    60 to 80 per cent. of the amount of first lien transferred to\r\n    the constructors. The Construction Company disposes of the\r\n    bonds, partly by negotiating their sale to the public through\r\n    bankers, at an advance upon the valuation at which they had\r\n    received them, and partly by using them in payment for rails and\r\n    equipment. Beyond the profits made from building the road for\r\n    the first mortgage bonds, there remains in the hands of the\r\n    constructors the entire capital stock and any second mortgage\r\n    bonds they may have received, _as a clear bonus_, to be held for\r\n    future appreciation, and to keep control of the Company and be\r\n    ultimately sold on a market deftly manipulated for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    This is the way in which a large majority of our railroads have\r\n    been and others are still constructed. It will thus be seen that\r\n    the actual cash cost of a railroad is ordinarily less than 60\r\n    per cent. of the stock and bonds issued against the property,\r\n    and that its first mortgage exceeds the amount of the legitimate\r\n    actual cost of the road.\r\n\r\n    The basis of all the discredit, the embarrassments, the\r\n    bankruptcies and the robberies of our railroad system is thus\r\n    laid at the inception of the enterprises. They rest upon an\r\n    intrinsically rotten and dishonest foundation; and the evil is\r\n    far from having reached the end of its mischief to the\r\n    financial, political and social interests of the country. In\r\n    some few cases, railroads thus exorbitantly capitalized have\r\n    proved able to earn the interest on their debt, provide for\r\n    additional outlays on construction and betterments, and even to\r\n    pay dividends on their stock; but, in a large majority of cases,\r\n    they have had to undergo a process of financial reconstruction,\r\n    in order to bring the debts of the Company within its ability to\r\n    meet its fixed charges. It is not a risky estimate to suppose\r\n    that of our present 125,000 miles of railroad, with its\r\n    $7,500,000,000 of stock and debts, 60 per cent. has undergone\r\n    this process of debt-scaling and rehabilitation. Were it not\r\n    that the new roads have opened up new country for settlement,\r\n    which has become an immediate source of traffic, these bad\r\n    financial results would have been more general and worse than\r\n    they have proved to be. The risks attending the building of\r\n    lines into unsettled regions ought to have been a reason why\r\n    they should be constructed upon conservative principles; but, in\r\n    reality, the prospects of settling new populations and of\r\n    tapping new sources of wealth, have been so magnified to the\r\n    eyes of distant and credulous lenders as to enable the\r\n    speculative constructors to easily consummate their illegitimate\r\n    schemes.\r\n\r\n    The general result of this system of financiering has been to\r\n    deprive the legitimate original investors of their chances of\r\n    making a fair return out of their investment. As a rule, the\r\n    bondholders have provided all the capital expended, and the\r\n    stockholders have invested nothing. The bondholders incur all\r\n    the risks; the stockholders have no responsibilities. If the\r\n    enterprise proves a success, the bondholders get their interest,\r\n    while the stockholders, without a dollar of original outlay, get\r\n    vastly more than ever falls to the mortgage creditors through\r\n    the stock becoming an instrument of profitable speculation. If\r\n    the enterprise is a failure, the bondholder has to forego\r\n    interest and finally to accept a new mortgage for a less amount\r\n    and at a lower rate of interest; whilst the original stockholder\r\n    has, in the meantime, made money out of artificially “booming”\r\n    the shares in Wall Street.\r\n\r\n    The profits realized on these speculative constructions are\r\n    enormous, and have constituted the chief source of the\r\n    phenomenal fortunes piled up by our railroad millionaires within\r\n    the last twenty years. It is no exaggeration to characterize\r\n    these transactions as direct frauds upon the public. They may\r\n    not be such in a sense recognized by the law, for legislation\r\n    has strangely neglected to provide against their perpetration;\r\n    but, morally, they are nothing less, for they are essentially\r\n    deceptive and unjust, and involve an oppressive taxation of the\r\n    public at large for the benefit of a few individuals, who have\r\n    given no equivalent for what they get. The result of this system\r\n    is that, on an average, the railroads of the country are\r\n    capitalized at probably fully 50 per cent. in excess of their\r\n    actual cost. The managers of the roads claim the right to earn\r\n    dividends upon this fictitious capital, and it is their constant\r\n    effort to accomplish that object. So far as they succeed, they\r\n    exercise an utterly unjust taxation upon the public, by exacting\r\n    a compensation in excess of a fair return upon the capital\r\n    actually invested. This unjust exaction amounts to a direct\r\n    charge and burthen on the trade of the country, which limits the\r\n    ability of the American producer and merchant to compete with\r\n    those of foreign nations, and checks the development of our vast\r\n    natural resources. In a country of “magnificent distances,” like\r\n    ours, the cost of transportation is one of the foremost factors\r\n    affecting its capacity for progress; and the artificial\r\n    enhancement of freight and passenger rates due to this false\r\n    capitalization has been a far more serious bar to our material\r\n    development than public opinion has yet realized. The hundreds\r\n    of millions of wealth so suddenly accumulated by our railroad\r\n    monarchs is the measure of this iniquitous taxation, this\r\n    perverted distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n    This creation of a powerful aristocracy of wealth, which\r\n    originated in a diseased system of finance, must ultimately\r\n    become a source of very serious social and political disorder.\r\n    The descendants of the mushroom millionaires of the present\r\n    generation will consolidate into a broad and almost omnipotent\r\n    money power, whose sympathies and influence will conflict with\r\n    our political institutions at every point of contact. They will\r\n    exercise a vast control over the larger organizations and\r\n    movements of capital; monopolies will seek protection under\r\n    their wing; and, by the ascendancy which wealth always confers,\r\n    they will steadily broaden their grasp upon the legislation, the\r\n    banking and the commerce of the nation.\r\n\r\n    The illegitimate methods by which the wealth of this class has\r\n    been accumulated cannot always remain a mystery to the masses.\r\n    The time will come when every citizen will clearly perceive how\r\n    his interests have been sacrificed for the creation of this\r\n    abnormal class; and, when that time comes, a series of public\r\n    questions will arise that will strain our political institutions\r\n    to their very foundations. Already the working masses begin to\r\n    see the dim outline of the gigantic wrong that has been\r\n    inflicted upon them in common with all other classes. If they do\r\n    not understand the exact method by which a portion of the\r\n    rewards of labor has thus been diverted from them, they clearly\r\n    comprehend which is the class responsible. The labor troubles\r\n    that have so seriously shaken confidence during the spring of\r\n    this year have been largely stimulated by an idea that a serious\r\n    wrong has been done to the workman in the creation of these\r\n    abnormal fortunes. It is not surprising—although it may lead to\r\n    disappointing results—if workingmen should reason that, if\r\n    railroads can afford to make a few men so wonderfully rich, they\r\n    can afford to pay their employees higher wages and for shorter\r\n    hours. Nor can we wonder if, when capitalists are on every hand\r\n    piling up their wealth by the tens of millions, the laborer\r\n    should conclude that he ought to be able to get a few dollars a\r\n    week more, or deduct an hour or two off his day’s work, without\r\n    very seriously hurting the employing class. This may be and is\r\n    very fallacious reasoning; but it is what might very naturally\r\n    be expected under these circumstances, from a class who are not\r\n    trained to think beyond surface depth. It will be of no avail to\r\n    tell the workmen that this unjust distribution of wealth is\r\n    final and irrevocable; that there is no power of redress by\r\n    which a wrong of this nature can be righted; or that, as voting\r\n    citizens, they are as much responsible as anybody else for\r\n    permitting the neglects and defects of legislation that have\r\n    made these inequalities possible. This class never reason either\r\n    calmly or logically, and it will take a great deal of fruitless\r\n    agitation to satisfy them of the hopelessness of their methods\r\n    of seeking reparation.\r\n\r\n    The Socialistic seductions which have captivated such large\r\n    masses of the working population of Europe will all the more\r\n    readily find acceptance among our millions of laborers because\r\n    they have before their eyes such conspicuous instances of the\r\n    unequal division of wealth and of the overwhelming power of\r\n    organized capital. Certainly, if any facts could be supposed to\r\n    justify the doctrines of Socialism and Communism, it would be\r\n    the sudden creation of such fortunes as those which, within a\r\n    very few years, have come into the hands of our railroad\r\n    magnates. A few years later, the public will understand much\r\n    better than it now does how facts like these have contributed to\r\n    the raising of questions of government which will dangerously\r\n    test the cohesion and endurance of our political institutions.\r\n\r\n    Artificial methods of establishing our railroad corporations\r\n    have naturally led to artificial methods of regulating their\r\n    operations. Over-capitalization incapacitates the roads for\r\n    competition; for it necessarily holds out a temptation to\r\n    parallel existing roads by others at a lower capitalization. As\r\n    roads running between the same points were multiplied,\r\n    competition for “through” business became more active, until not\r\n    only were dividends threatened on some of the best lines, but\r\n    some roads were driven into default on their mortgages. At this\r\n    point the “pool” was introduced—a device by which all lines\r\n    running between the same points agree to put their business from\r\n    through traffic into a common aggregate, to be distributed among\r\n    the several members according to certain accepted percentages.\r\n    It was hoped that, in this way, uniformity of charges could be\r\n    maintained, at such rates as were necessary to make the business\r\n    satisfactory to each member. This, however, was soon found to be\r\n    a step “from the mud into the mire.” The pool was discovered to\r\n    operate as a premium on the construction of new parallels.\r\n\r\n    Speculators were quick to perceive that they could build new\r\n    lines on the same routes for much less cost than the old ones,\r\n    and that, with a lower capitalization, they could easily compel\r\n    the pool to admit them to membership, with all the privileges of\r\n    a ready-made traffic and with all the guarantees the pool could\r\n    afford of exemption from competition, and of ample charges.\r\n    Thus, the pools that, in the first instance, were made necessary\r\n    through the evils of speculative methods of construction,\r\n    became, in turn, the source of a new and even worse form of the\r\n    same evil. New roads were built, or sets of old detached ones\r\n    were connected, so as to afford additional parallels to the\r\n    existing trunk lines, with no other object than to compel the\r\n    latter to support them by dividing with them a portion of their\r\n    traffic, or to accept the alternative of a reckless cutting down\r\n    of rates. The end to this viciously excessive system of\r\n    construction can only come when the pools have been reduced to\r\n    such a low condition that they will no longer care to take\r\n    newcomers into their co-partnership; in which case speculative\r\n    builders will see no chance for profit in such ventures. The\r\n    fate of the “Nickel Plate” and of the West Shore speculations,\r\n    by which nearly 1,000 miles of needless road was built to divide\r\n    traffic with the Vanderbilt system, serves as a warning against\r\n    the danger of building roads to live upon pool support; but,\r\n    nevertheless, the Eastern trunk pool still stands exposed to a\r\n    great deal of harassing outside competition from possible and\r\n    contemplated new combinations of existing detached links. Routes\r\n    of the latter kind are even more formidable competitors than new\r\n    lines, because they can be provided at a lower capitalization,\r\n    and have already the support of an established way traffic. It\r\n    would not be surprising if, within the next three or four years,\r\n    several new routes should in this way be established between New\r\n    York and Chicago.\r\n\r\n    It will thus be seen that the very contrivance intended to stave\r\n    off the vicious effects of artificial capitalization is\r\n    contributing, by a sort of punitive process, towards the end of\r\n    reducing earnings to a just ratio to the true value of the\r\n    properties. The weakness of the pool, arising from its\r\n    temptations to new competitors to enter the field, is not the\r\n    only cause of its failure. Up to this time it has been found\r\n    impossible to find a form of pool stringent enough to restrain\r\n    the members from cutting rates against each other. The modes of\r\n    possible evasion are so numerous, the sacrifices of special\r\n    advantages that each member has to make are so galling, the\r\n    small share that remains to each road in a numerously divided\r\n    business is so small, and the temptations of agents to get\r\n    freight “by hook or by crook,” in dull times are so\r\n    irresistible, that the strictest watching and the severest\r\n    penalties fail to secure a faithful observance of the pool\r\n    agreements. Much forbearance is shown towards transgressions,\r\n    and deliberate violations have to be condoned or connived at;\r\n    but, all the time, the pools are in imminent danger of\r\n    jealousies and breaches of faith causing their disruption. No\r\n    sooner have they won public confidence by maintaining harmony\r\n    through a period of prosperous business, than the public wake up\r\n    to find that some member has been secretly “cutting,” and the\r\n    agreements are torn to pieces.\r\n\r\n    The result is, that the public have lost all confidence in the\r\n    ability of the pool to regulate competition; and, still worse\r\n    for the railroads, their managers are losing faith in them also.\r\n    The great crucial test of this expedient so far as respects the\r\n    Eastern lines, is likely to come when the number of smaller\r\n    outside competitors, of the character just alluded to, comes to\r\n    be increased. The pool will not be likely to admit them into its\r\n    fold, which already includes too many diverse interests to\r\n    permit of harmony; and if it did, the danger of disagreements\r\n    and disruption would be only thereby increased. And yet, if\r\n    those routes are shut out, they will act as so many free lances,\r\n    attacking the older lines in every direction, and doing business\r\n    at rates which will leave the pool companies no alternative but\r\n    to follow suit. In this dilemma, the outlook for some time ahead\r\n    is not an encouraging one for the older companies. To my view,\r\n    it seems very probable that their original sins of construction\r\n    and their subsequent transgressions of stock “watering” are\r\n    about to find them out. The natural law of competition is a\r\n    terrible foe to the violators of commercial justice. It is the\r\n    inevitable police power of trade. Its working may be evaded for\r\n    a time; its final conquest over wrongs and monopolies may\r\n    sometimes be delayed beyond the limits of human patience, and\r\n    men may at such times lose confidence in its power to right the\r\n    wrongs of society; but its ultimate success in the restoration\r\n    of equity and fair-play is as certain as the rising of the sun.\r\n\r\n    My absolute confidence in the ultimate triumph of this principle\r\n    prompts me to venture the assertion that, _at no very distant\r\n    period_, the wrongs practised in the original construction of\r\n    our railroads and in the subsequent “waterings” of their stocks,\r\n    will be compensated through competition adjusting the profits of\r\n    the companies to the equivalent of a fair return upon a _true\r\n    valuation_ of the properties; that is, a value measured by what\r\n    they are able to earn under the conditions of free competition\r\n    and the now current cash cost of providing like facilities.\r\n    That, it appears to me, is the solution towards which our\r\n    railroad problem is now steadily working; and neither\r\n    Congressional legislation, nor State regulation, nor the\r\n    resistance of organized capital, can be expected much longer to\r\n    stave off that result.\r\n\r\n    It may, however, be very properly asked, whether legislation\r\n    has no duty in the premises? To me, it appears that it has a\r\n    very weighty one. The consequences of the original neglect\r\n    to prescribe proper regulations for the construction,\r\n    capitalization and financial management of railroads has\r\n    been so fully exposed by their past history, that the\r\n    Legislatures will greatly err if they neglect to impose\r\n    restrictions upon future corporations that will prevent\r\n    farther repetition or perpetuation of the evils. When the\r\n    Government bestows upon railroads important privileges and\r\n    franchises, under which fundamental private rights are held\r\n    in abeyance for the common good, it is due to the public\r\n    protection that the recipients of these favors should be\r\n    held under restrictions which will prevent them from abusing\r\n    the privilege to the public disadvantage.\r\n\r\n    When a railroad company capitalizes its property at double its\r\n    actual cost, and seeks to collect charges calculated to yield\r\n    dividends upon such false capital, it grossly perverts and\r\n    abuses the privileges conferred by its charter, and virtually\r\n    perpetrates a public robbery. This appears to be a perfectly\r\n    plain proposition, and yet this glaring wrong has been so long\r\n    tolerated that not only the railroads, but a portion of the\r\n    public even, have come to regard it as a sort of right inherent\r\n    in these corporations. One of the first duties of the State\r\n    Legislatures, therefore, is to enact laws requiring that the\r\n    stocks and bonds issued against any railroad hereafter built\r\n    shall, in no case, exceed in the aggregate the _true cash cost_\r\n    of the property; the penalty for the violation of this\r\n    restriction to be forfeiture of charter. The responsibility of\r\n    managers should be definitely fixed. All extensions, betterments\r\n    or improvements should be provided for by issues of stock or\r\n    bonds on like conditions. The issue of mortgages should be\r\n    restricted within 60 per cent. of the true cost of the property.\r\n\r\n    In order to prevent wrongful speculative profits being realized\r\n    by the incorporators, they should be prevented from becoming the\r\n    constructors of their road, directly or indirectly; and all\r\n    contracts for construction, equipment, extensions or\r\n    improvements should be made upon open competitive bids, the\r\n    lowest bid to be accepted, with substantial guarantees for the\r\n    faithful performance of the contract. Also, it should be made\r\n    the duty of a board of State railroad commissioners to see to it\r\n    that all these conditions are strictly complied with.\r\n    Regulations should be provided prohibiting issues of stock for\r\n    any other than construction or equipment purposes, forbidding\r\n    the payment of dividends not actually earned, and enforcing the\r\n    amplest publicity of details relating to current traffic and the\r\n    financial affairs of the companies.\r\n\r\n    Had our original railroad laws incorporated provisions of this\r\n    character, our railroads would have all along ranked as the\r\n    safest and most stable investments of the country; the discredit\r\n    that hangs over our corporate enterprises would have been\r\n    averted; transportation would have been done at lower rates with\r\n    steadier charges, and we should have been saved the social and\r\n    political excrescence of an aristocracy based upon ill-gotten\r\n    wealth. After our bitter experience of the dangerous results of\r\n    neglecting to guard the railroad interest by some such\r\n    restraints as the foregoing it surely is not too early now to\r\n    apply these safer methods to all future enterprises of this\r\n    character. Not only is such legislation due as a measure\r\n    necessary for the protection of our commerce and investors, but\r\n    it would go very far towards remedying the evils that have grown\r\n    up under the old and badly regulated system. To a man of\r\n    business it is hardly necessary to point out what would be the\r\n    competitive advantages of roads constructed under the proposed\r\n    regulations. As a rule, their capitalization would not exceed 50\r\n    to 60 per cent. of that of the older companies, and they could,\r\n    therefore, be run upon a much lower rate of charges.\r\n\r\n    The thoroughly conservative nature of their organization would\r\n    bespeak fer them a degree of public confidence which would\r\n    enable them to get all the capital needed for really legitimate\r\n    undertakings, whilst purely speculative ventures would be put\r\n    under conservative check. Under these circumstances new roads\r\n    could do a profitable business, and yet compete disastrously\r\n    with the old excessively capitalized companies. The ultimate\r\n    result of this competition from the new order of roads would\r\n    inevitably be to reduce the earnings of the older class to a\r\n    point which would admit of interest and dividends being earned\r\n    _only on the same rate of capitalization as existed among the\r\n    new-system companies_. In other words, the effect of the honest\r\n    method of capitalization here suggested would be to squeeze all\r\n    the “water” out of the old companies, and to bring them in\r\n    effect, though possibly not in form, to the same financial level\r\n    as the new.\r\n\r\n    If my reasoning here is correct, there is cause for our great\r\n    railroad capitalists to look out for the security of their\r\n    investments. The basis for their wealth may prove far less\r\n    certain than they have imagined it to be. With the prevailing\r\n    and steadily increasing public feeling against the methods of\r\n    railroad capitalists and the working of our railroad system,\r\n    what assurance can there be that, when a remedy for these\r\n    corporate wrongs comes to be clearly propounded, it will not be\r\n    eagerly urged upon the attention of the Legislatures and adopted\r\n    without much ceremony? The dash of a Governor’s pen is,\r\n    therefore, all that stands between the railroad millionaire and\r\n    the sudden extinction of a large portion of his inflated paper\r\n    wealth. Is this a chimerical conclusion? The question, it seems\r\n    to me, deserves a far more serious consideration than those most\r\n    vitally concerned have yet bestowed upon it. No man can\r\n    confidently deny the possibility of such a result as is here\r\n    indicated. No one familiar with the present public temper on the\r\n    subject of railroad monopoly can reasonably question _the\r\n    probability even_ of a settlement of this kind being ere long\r\n    resorted to. Under these circumstances, it is a question very\r\n    pertinent to the times, whether the foundation of our railroad\r\n    aristocracy is as broad or as firm as it has been supposed to\r\n    be, and whether a healthy solution of the great railroad problem\r\n    is as difficult and as remote as some despondent people have\r\n    represented it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.\r\n  Repudiated.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n          GEORGIA REPUDIATION BONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A SOVEREIGN SOUTHERN STATE CHEATED THE NORTHERN MEN WHO HELPED HER\r\n    IN DISTRESS.—A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.—CANCELLATION BY REPUDIATION\r\n    OF JUST CLAIMS FOR CASH LOANED TO SUSTAIN THE STATE GOVERNMENT,\r\n    BUILD PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MAKE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS.—BOTTOM FACTS OF\r\n    THE OUTRAGE.—THE RECENT ATTEMPT TO PLACE A NEW ISSUE OF GEORGIA\r\n    BONDS ON THE MARKET, WHILE THE OLD ONES REMAIN UNPAID.—THE CASE\r\n    BEFORE THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.—HE EXAMINES\r\n    THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE BONDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAVINGS\r\n    BANKS.—HIS DECISION PROHIBITS THESE INSTITUTIONS FROM INVESTING THE\r\n    HARD EARNINGS OF THE WORKING PEOPLE IN THESE DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS\r\n    SECURITIES.—A BOLD EFFORT TO HAVE THE FRESH ISSUE OF GEORGIA PAPER\r\n    PUT UPON THE LIST OF LEGITIMATE SECURITIES OF THE NEW YORK STOCK\r\n    EXCHANGE FIRMLY OPPOSED AND EVENTUALLY FRUSTRATED.—REFLECTIONS ON\r\n    THE BAD POLICY WHICH ADVOCATED REPUDIATION AND HAS INJURED GEORGIA\r\n    CREDIT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.—GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE\r\n    NATURE OF REPUDIATION OF STATES’ DEBTS, AND THE MORAL INFLUENCE ON\r\n    THE GENERAL CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES.—SUCCESSFUL APPEAL OF\r\n    BONDHOLDERS OF THE REPUDIATED BONDS TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest events of my business experience arose from the\r\npurest motives on my part, to aid the South in the work of\r\nreconstruction, in the way of which, as I have stated in the previous\r\nchapter, President Johnson threw the greatest obstacles.\r\n\r\nI ventured my money and offered my friendship at a time when that\r\nsection of the country stood in need of both money and friendship, and\r\nused my best efforts to bring about the return of such feelings of\r\nfraternal harmony as should exist among all the citizens of this great\r\ncountry. For these kindly offices I was treated with the basest\r\ningratitude by some of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nI held a large amount of Southern securities, all issued for full value\r\nreceived, which went into the internal improvements of that section,\r\nenhancing the taxable value of its property. These securities bore the\r\ngreat seals of the Sovereign States of Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe dishonor attaching to repudiation in these instances has been\r\nbrought out in more glaring colors, from the fact that these States have\r\nlong since become abundantly able to liquidate their obligations, and to\r\nerase the black spot from the escutcheons of their chivalrous people.\r\n\r\nThe people themselves are not so much to blame as the disreputable\r\npoliticians into whose hands the management of their affairs had fallen.\r\n\r\nIt is of the sovereign and high-toned State of Georgia that I have most\r\noccasion to complain. On account of the bad faith of that State, through\r\nher political managers, I suffered a terrible reverse in my fortune,\r\nwhich came near crushing out my financial existence.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, surprising, I think, that having placed my faith\r\nin the integrity of that State and the promises of its officials and\r\ngoverning power, and having been so basely deceived, that I should now\r\nbe aroused to act in self defence, fight for my rights and do all in my\r\npower to cause the bonds or securities for which I paid good money to be\r\nredeemed, and to have my just claims satisfied. It has therefore, been\r\nincumbent upon me to leave no stone unturned in fighting this battle,\r\nwith the hope of recovering the money, or a part of it, that was filched\r\nfrom me through the ostensible defalcations of these sovereign and\r\nchivalrous States.\r\n\r\nAbout thirteen years ago the repudiation which has reflected such\r\ndisgrace upon the South became prevalent in that section, and took the\r\ncharacter, for a time, of a severe financial epidemic.\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that the Legislature of the State of New York, as\r\nwell as the legislatures of several other States, considered it\r\nnecessary for the protection of the savings banks, which are the\r\ncustodians of many hundreds of millions, chiefly of the hard earnings of\r\nthe working people, to prohibit these institutions from investing in, or\r\nloaning upon, the securities of any State in the Union that had within\r\nten years previously repudiated any of its lawful obligations.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the State of New York, in chapter 409, section 260, of the\r\nlaws of 1882, provides that savings banks shall be prohibited from\r\ninvesting money in stocks or bonds of any State which, in the language\r\nof the statute, “has within ten years previous to making such investment\r\nby such corporation defaulted in the payment of any part of either\r\nprincipal or interest of any debt authorized by any legislature of such\r\nState to be contracted.”\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that the newly issued securities of some of the\r\nSouthern States have been unable to find a resting place in the monied\r\ninstitutions of the North.\r\n\r\nThe State of Georgia, recently finding that she had some obligations\r\nbecoming due, and seeing that money was cheap in the North, and that\r\nmore than ten years had expired since she repudiated her former\r\nobligations, thought there was a good opportunity of issuing a fresh\r\nbatch of these so-called securities, similar to those that had been\r\ndishonored in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe politicians of Georgia thought there was a good opening in the State\r\nof New York to remove the restriction placed upon the savings banks in\r\n1882. They saw that the Governor and the Legislature were both\r\nDemocratic, with a Democratic Attorney-General also, and therefore\r\ndetermined to take advantage of this political condition, which they\r\nsupposed was highly favorable to their scheme of stealing a march upon\r\nthe holders of the old repudiated bonds of Georgia, who had been chiefly\r\ninstrumental in getting the act passed for the safety of savings banks’\r\ndepositors in the State of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia politicians aimed at having the restriction of the savings\r\nbanks removed, so far as it related to their State, in order to afford\r\nthem an opportunity of issuing several millions of 4½ per cent. bonds\r\nfor the purpose of taking up an old issue of the 7 per cent. bonds, thus\r\neffecting a considerable saving to the taxpayers of their State in this\r\nreduction of interest.\r\n\r\nWith the purpose of having this matter arranged as quietly as possible,\r\ntwo of the ablest lawyers of the State of Georgia were surreptitiously\r\nsent to Albany to make argument before the Attorney-General, Mr. Denis\r\nO’Brien, and to attempt to convince that official, in a very plausible\r\nmanner, why the restriction should be removed from the savings banks in\r\nthe case of Georgia. No opposition was expected, and the enthusiastic\r\nhope was indulged by those who were engineering the scheme that upon\r\nthis _ex-parte_ statement of these astute Georgia lawyers a favorable\r\nopinion would be elicited from the Attorney-General of this State, which\r\nwould justify the Superintendent of the Bank Department in issuing an\r\norder to remove the restriction which precluded the savings banks of New\r\nYork from investing in Georgia bonds, on the ground that the State had\r\nnot repudiated within ten years. The repudiation could be traced back\r\nthirteen years, instead of ten.\r\n\r\nPursuant to this application, a small item of a few lines appeared in\r\none of the Atlanta papers, which stated that Mr. Calhoun had just\r\nreturned from Albany, having made a very strong and forcible appeal to\r\nthe Attorney-General there, urging him that the restriction on the part\r\nof the savings banks be removed so far as Georgia was concerned.\r\n\r\nThis item was telegraphed to me, and on receiving the despatch I\r\nnotified the holders of the repudiated bonds, and wired the\r\nAttorney-General asking him when a hearing of the other side could be\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nWhen the day arrived for the hearing before the Attorney-General, Mr.\r\nCalhoun was surprised to find that there was any opposition to his\r\napplication, as the business had been so quietly managed that it was\r\nsupposed by the Georgia members of the Bar that the bondholders would\r\nhardly be apprised of it until everything should be fixed according to\r\nthe pre-arranged programme, and in favor of the repudiating State\r\nobtaining fresh and unlimited credit without settling up the old score.\r\nMr. Calhoun was assisted in his able argument on the sovereign right of\r\nrepudiation by the Hon. N. J. Hammond, Member of Congress and\r\nex-Attorney-General of Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn reply to these great lights of the Southern Bar, whose genius would\r\nhave shone more brilliantly in an honest cause, I made the following\r\naddress:\r\n\r\nHenry Clews’ speech before the Attorney-General of the State of New\r\nYork, June 20, 1885:\r\n\r\n    The original act of repudiation by the State of Georgia has been\r\n    repeated each six months since that period to the present date,\r\n    by the refusal of the State to recognize and pay the coupons on\r\n    said bonds as they matured. This alone repeats the repudiation\r\n    of that State twice each year for the past ten years at least,\r\n    and therefore is a continuance of the repudiation from the time\r\n    of the original vile act up to the present date; besides which,\r\n    the bonds repudiated had twenty years to run. The maturity of\r\n    said bonds does not expire until 1890. The repudiation should be\r\n    considered, therefore, as continuous during the entire period,\r\n    from the date of the issue of said bonds until 1890, five years\r\n    hence. If it is to be accepted that the test of a State’s credit\r\n    is to be able to show a record free from fresh repudiation for a\r\n    period of ten years, and that repudiation is not a continuous\r\n    repudiation until such obligations are fully settled and\r\n    provided for, what is to prevent a State from negotiating a\r\n    fabulously large amount of bonds, and thereby place an amount\r\n    sufficiently large in her treasury to admit of bridging over for\r\n    the required ten years, and, after making such ample provision,\r\n    then pass an act, as heretofore, repudiating the bonds issued,\r\n    and keep repeating it each decade? Supposing the same rule held\r\n    good with a bank robber—and there is, as far as integrity goes,\r\n    really no great difference between the two, only one seeks\r\n    protection in Canada and the other behind her sovereign rights,\r\n    which is her Canada refuge. The robber breaks into a savings\r\n    bank, guts it of several millions of dollars, flees to Canada,\r\n    and there lives in affluence for ten years. How silly it would\r\n    appear if, after ten years, provided he could show a record free\r\n    from thieving during that time, he had the legal right then to\r\n    come back, and thereby be entitled to a clean record as an\r\n    honest man, and in consequence be accorded a high credit. The\r\n    position of the State of Georgia in assuming such a role, in\r\n    coming here at this time to ask our savings banks to aid her in\r\n    such a nefarious business, simply lacks a parallel for audacity.\r\n    The management of savings banks must be conducted so as to\r\n    inspire confidence with the depositors and with the entire\r\n    community also. It is necessary, especially at panic periods,\r\n    for full confidence to be felt in the investments of such\r\n    institutions. If the prohibition is removed, as is now sought to\r\n    be, and savings banks be permitted to invest in Georgia\r\n    securities, and one of them should buy $500,000 of the bonds, I\r\n    venture the prediction that such an investment will sooner or\r\n    later form the basis of a rumor which will cause a panic among\r\n    its depositors and break that institution. This would result in\r\n    a most serious disaster to probably thousands of poor people\r\n    whose money had been lodged there for safe-keeping. The mere\r\n    whisper during a panic that a certain institution had $500,000\r\n    of Georgia bonds, and they were about to be repudiated, would\r\n    bring about just such a disaster as I have stated.\r\n\r\n    I ask your Honor if it would be wise for any savings bank to be\r\n    permitted by the Superintendent of the Banking Department to\r\n    become thus exposed to ruin? A State that is abundantly able to\r\n    meet her obligations and dishonors them is too despicable for\r\n    either credit or tolerance in a civilized community, and it is a\r\n    disgrace to the nation that States comprising it have the power\r\n    to make such obligations and repudiate them at will and screen\r\n    themselves behind their sovereign rights, whereby they cannot be\r\n    sued, and in consequence leave the outrageously wronged innocent\r\n    bondholders without means of redress whatsoever. If the United\r\n    States Government ever expects to obtain that permanent high\r\n    credit in the money markets of the world to which the immense\r\n    resources of this magnificent country justly entitle her, the\r\n    great and growing evil of State repudiation must be remedied.\r\n    For States to repudiate with impunity, as the State of Georgia\r\n    has done, leaving no means whatever for redress on the part of\r\n    the victimized creditors, is a blot upon the escutcheon of the\r\n    whole country. This is not a fight, your Honor, on the battle\r\n    field against the South; it is a fight on the financial field,\r\n    and, as it is second only in importance to the other, it must be\r\n    settled, and now is the time to strike the blow, as it will do\r\n    the most good in that direction. We, the creditors of Georgia,\r\n    have not only borne the loss and hardship of having our\r\n    securities made valueless by a legislative body, and many of us\r\n    ruined thereby, but we have also been vilely defamed—being\r\n    branded as conspirators to rob the State—simply because we were\r\n    found to be holders of these dishonored bonds. This has been\r\n    done by the State to cover up her own infamy, and make it appear\r\n    that we were the guilty parties and not the State. The attitude\r\n    of the State of Georgia, your Honor, is not unlike that of a\r\n    pickpocket, who, after rifling his neighbor’s pockets, is the\r\n    first to cry “stop thief” to elude detection. All that the\r\n    bondholders ask and claim is to have the entire case submitted\r\n    to a proper judicial tribunal. This right we have been denied by\r\n    the State, and the Constitution leaves us powerless to enforce\r\n    it. The State simply says, the bonds are fraudulent and we will\r\n    not pay them. It is a very remarkable circumstance, however,\r\n    that there has not been a single one of the numerous officials,\r\n    from ex-Governor Bullock down, who were connected with the issue\r\n    of these so-called fraudulent bonds, prosecuted to conviction in\r\n    the thirteen years that have intervened since their issue. Still\r\n    these bonds are all repudiated on the ground of being\r\n    fraudulently issued, and the innocent bondholders alone are made\r\n    to suffer the harsh penalty imposed for having staked their\r\n    money on their belief in the honor and integrity of the people\r\n    of Georgia, which it is quite apparent are now _non est_.\r\n\r\n    I addressed a letter to your Honor on May 27th last, which\r\n    contains important information in connection with these\r\n    repudiated bonds. I ask permission to read this letter at the\r\n    present time, so that it may become a part of the evidence in\r\n    this case.\r\n\r\nThe following circular letter contains a variety of opinions analyzing\r\nthe true relations of the State of Georgia to her creditors, and clearly\r\nsetting forth the nature of her liability in the matter of the\r\nrepudiated bonds in connection with the house of which I was the head:\r\n\r\n        REPUDIATION ROBBERY BY THE “SOVEREIGN” STATE OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n    “_The divine doctrine of State Sovereignty, which makes a State\r\n         too dignified to be sued for its debts, ought to make\r\n            it also too respectable to cheat its creditors_”\r\n\r\nNOTICE.—Managers of Insurance Companies or Savings Banks should be and\r\nare likely to be held responsible, by stockholders and depositors, for\r\nany losses incurred in the event of their buying or loaning upon any\r\nbonds issued hereafter by States which are under the cloud of\r\nrepudiation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                             NEW YORK, May 27, 1885.\r\n\r\n    HON. WM. A. POST, _Deputy Attorney-General, Albany, N. Y._:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:—I deferred answering your telegram of Saturday until\r\n    this morning for the purpose of ascertaining whether the\r\n    bondholders’ counsel would be in readiness to meet you at the\r\n    time proposed, and only ascertained the fact this morning that\r\n    he would, so I wired you accordingly. I presume that this\r\n    Georgia repudiation question comes before you for the purpose of\r\n    removing the prohibition from the savings banks of this State to\r\n    their buying or loaning upon Georgia State bonds, owing to that\r\n    State being under the cloud of repudiation. The prohibition of\r\n    the savings banks, issued by Mr. A. B. Hepburn, the former\r\n    Superintendent of the Banking Department, was based upon a\r\n    thorough and exhaustive examination in reference to all matters\r\n    appertaining thereto. This I have reason to know, as that\r\n    gentleman visited New York and took my testimony and others in\r\n    the case. The State of Georgia has always charged, as the\r\n    justification for repudiation, that R. B. Bullock, Governor at\r\n    the time of the issue of said bonds, had issued the bonds\r\n    without proper legislative authority, and besides had stolen or\r\n    misappropriated most of the avails. About three years since\r\n    Governor Bullock visited Atlanta, Ga., and demanded his trial\r\n    under the several indictments against him. The trial came up\r\n    soon thereafter, and he was acquitted on all the charges. This\r\n    gentleman is now a resident of Atlanta, Ga., and is to-day one\r\n    of its most prominent citizens. It has been also charged that as\r\n    he was a Northern born man, that he was a “carpet-bag” Governor,\r\n    and for that reason the bonds were not a legal issue. That\r\n    attitude is also unwarrantable, as the ex-Governor remained\r\n    South during the period of the entire war, and took a prominent\r\n    part on the Confederate side, in giving aid and comfort, and\r\n    thereby can justly be considered as being a Southerner and not a\r\n    Northerner in his interests and feelings. Most of the bonds\r\n    repudiated were passed upon as legally issued and properly\r\n    signed, by our best lawyers, such as Messrs. Evarts, Southmayd &\r\n    Choate, ex-Judge Emott, Abbott Bros., E. Randolph Robinson, the\r\n    brother of Judge Sedgwick, of this city, and others.\r\n\r\n    Some of these repudiated bonds were also passed upon by the New\r\n    York Stock Exchange, and because repudiated were afterwards\r\n    stricken from the list of securities to be dealt in. The face of\r\n    these securities were worth par a few days prior to their\r\n    repudiation, and immediately after that Act was passed were\r\n    reduced to no more than the value of the paper upon which they\r\n    were engraved. The same may at any time be the fate of any new\r\n    securities to be issued by that State. Those who had these bonds\r\n    were and are innocent parties, and among the sufferers are Trust\r\n    Companies and savings banks. The Metropolitan Savings Bank holds\r\n    $100,000 of the 7 per cent. Georgia gold bonds, bought about\r\n    par; the Brooklyn Trust Trust Co. holds $100,000; the Union\r\n    Trust Co. holds $100,000; the Commercial Warehouse Co. held\r\n    between $300,000 and $400,000 of the bonds, and their\r\n    repudiation caused the failure of that institution. The New York\r\n    State Loan and Trust Co., Henry A. Smyth, President, also had\r\n    $100,000 of the bonds, which loss was largely instrumental in\r\n    causing the collapse of that concern. The Broadway National Bank\r\n    holds $200,000 of these bonds as collateral, upon which they\r\n    loaned $160,000; Morton, Bliss & Co., Morris K. Jesup, Drexel,\r\n    Morgan & Co., Ezra A. Boody, George Morgan, son-in-law of J. S.\r\n    Morgan, of London; J. Bowman Johnson & Co., Richard Irvin & Co.,\r\n    L. Von Hoffman & Co., Russell Sage and many other first-class\r\n    parties that I can name are prominent sufferers resulting from\r\n    Georgia’s repudiation; besides which, my firm in 1873 held over\r\n    $2,500,000 State of Georgia securities, all of which had been\r\n    paid for or advanced upon, and my firm’s suspension at that time\r\n    was attributable thereto.\r\n\r\n    The only way to do, in my judgment, is to make the Southern\r\n    States which are now under the serious cloud of repudiation,\r\n    understand that their credit is impaired and facilities for\r\n    obtaining money materially lessened because of it. Then,\r\n    realizing _that_ as their position, and finding that they are\r\n    shut out of the financial markets of the world owing thereto,\r\n    they will soon make a compromise with their lenient creditors,\r\n    and remove the blot from their escutcheons. The Federal\r\n    Government is comprised of the various States of the Union, and\r\n    to-day enjoys as high a credit as any nation in the world. If\r\n    the various States comprising the United States are permitted,\r\n    however, to repudiate with impunity and screen themselves behind\r\n    their sovereign rights so that creditors have no recourse, the\r\n    odium will soon fall upon the General Government, and its credit\r\n    will finally become tarnished if not crippled in consequence.\r\n    The State of Georgia, as can be proven, received full value. The\r\n    internal improvements in Georgia bear testimony of this. The\r\n    taxable property of the State has been immensely enhanced by\r\n    these improvements, and the debt repudiated is a mere bagatelle\r\n    as compared with the ability of the State of Georgia to provide\r\n    for it. She has become rich in late years, and if the stain of\r\n    repudiation should be wiped out, would stand an excellent chance\r\n    of becoming a favorite resort for emigration and for the flow of\r\n    capital. Emigrants from other countries to this, in locating,\r\n    first look to the credit enjoyed by the State their attention is\r\n    called to, and if found high, their conclusion is that there is\r\n    safety for property, and if so, corresponding safety for life;\r\n    but they will not go to a repudiating State, and in this way the\r\n    South is held in check in the development of her resources,\r\n    owing to the want of new blood. The bondholders of the State of\r\n    Georgia have frequently offered to leave all points at issue in\r\n    reference to Georgia’s repudiation to the Courts of that State,\r\n    to the United States District Judge, or to arbitration, the\r\n    parties to be selected by both sides, all of which has been\r\n    denied, the reply being the “bonds are repudiated, and we simply\r\n    will not take any steps to provide for their recognition or\r\n    payment, and what are you going to do about it?” Under the\r\n    circumstances, creditors are powerless, of course, to do\r\n    anything, as the State cannot be sued. If you desire it, I will\r\n    send you a sample bond of some of the issues repudiated, so that\r\n    you may see how beautifully the signatures are written, and how\r\n    firmly fixed the seal of the Commonwealth is placed upon them,\r\n    besides the magnificent steel engraved workmanship of the\r\n    Continental Bank Note Company of this city. If there was not a\r\n    prospect of the State of Georgia being forced by public opinion\r\n    to provide for these bonds at some future time, they would be\r\n    worthy to be framed and hung up in our parlors as a complete and\r\n    fine work of art.\r\n\r\n    Judge Lochrane, former Chief-Justice of the State of Georgia,\r\n    has wired me that he will appear before you on Wednesday;\r\n    Colonel R. A. Crawford, of Georgia, will also do so; Messrs.\r\n    Abbott Brothers, of this city, and others will appear before\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    You will please append this communication as a part of the\r\n    testimony, and should you desire more on the subject, call upon\r\n    me therefor.\r\n\r\n                        I have the honor to remain,\r\n\r\n                             Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                  HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    EDWARD BRANDON, ESQ., _Chairman of the Committee on the\r\n    Admission of Securities to the N. Y. Stock Exchange_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:—It is currently reported that the State of Georgia is\r\n    about to apply to your Committee to list a new issue of bonds.\r\n    In behalf of myself and others who have suffered most seriously\r\n    by that State’s unwarrantable repudiation of bonds, which have\r\n    as full a right to an equal standing as representing the credit\r\n    of the State of Georgia as possessed by the new bonds to be\r\n    issued, and fully realizing that the cruel fate of the former\r\n    merely represents what may be that of the latter, I claim the\r\n    right, as a member of the New York Stock Exchange, as a sufferer\r\n    to the extent of several millions of dollars by the State of\r\n    Georgia’s bad faith, to protest against the admission of any new\r\n    securities hereafter to be issued by that State until her\r\n    repudiated bonds are recognized and provided for.\r\n\r\n                        Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                             HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Bullock’s Democratic successor, soon after he was elected to\r\nthat position, appointed as Attorney and Agent for the State of Georgia,\r\none of the State’s ablest lawyers, a gentleman distinguished as having\r\nbeen a member of the Confederate Congress, to investigate all the\r\nbusiness transactions between Henry Clews & Co. and the State of\r\nGeorgia. Under his signature as Attorney and Agent for the State, he\r\nmakes the following statement: “I would say, with a great deal of\r\npleasure, that after a very thorough and complete examination of the\r\nbooks of account, papers and correspondence of Messrs. Clews & Co., so\r\nfar as they relate to transactions of that house with the State of\r\nGeorgia during Governor Bullock’s administration, I am satisfied that in\r\nall the dealings of that firm with the State of Georgia, they have acted\r\nwith both fairness and liberality, and I am convinced that in all these\r\nmatters Mr. Clews did nothing that would not bear the closest scrutiny,\r\nand he did nothing, in my opinion, to affect his character for integrity\r\nand fair dealing. I make this statement with the more pleasure because I\r\nbegan this examination of accounts of Clews & Co. under impressions very\r\nunfavorable to Mr. Clews.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe opinion of ex-Governor Brown, now our able senior United States\r\nSenator, was asked by thirty-five members of the Legislature of 1873. In\r\nthe course of a comprehensive and exhaustive argument, the distinguished\r\nSenator says: “The State will be driven to abandon this position\r\n(legislative repudiation) and to permit a case to be made by her\r\ncreditors to test the validity of these bonds in the courts of the\r\ncountry, or she must stand dishonored in the estimation of all good men,\r\nand her credit must sink to a ruinous depth.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late ex-Governor Alexander H. Stephens, ex-Vice-President of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, is on record as saying, in reference to this\r\nrepudiation, that it is “nothing short of public swindling. Not less\r\ninfamous than obtaining money under false pretences.” But the partisan\r\nfeeling was then so intense that even the lamented ex-Governor Jenkins\r\nwas hardly accorded a respectful hearing in the Constitutional\r\nConvention, of which he was president, when he plead against sweeping\r\nrepudiation without granting the holders a judicial hearing. Ex-Governor\r\nJenkins said on that memorable occasion: “Now, sir, I take this ground:\r\nthat for the proper examination and investigation oi these claims,\r\nneither the Legislature nor this Convention, nor the people themselves,\r\nare a proper tribunal to decide these matters. They ought to be examined\r\nand determined judicially. It will now, I presume, be admitted that the\r\nfive years’ time between legislative and constitutional convention\r\nrepudiation was not allowed to pass unnoticed by the parties having\r\nthese bond claims against the State. Having waived our sovereignty in\r\nthe past to allow the State to be sued in every county in the State on\r\nclaims for small-pox expenses, I submit that our sovereignty ought not\r\nto be plead to bar so important an issue as that now under\r\nconsideration. The State can, in no event, be put to loss. The whole\r\nState has been largely benefited by the legislation and by the executive\r\naction which was subsequently repudiated. We have been for fifteen years\r\npast collecting annual taxes on fifty millions of enhanced value of our\r\ntaxable property; an increase which is directly traceable to the good\r\neffects of the new railroads built under that legislative and executive\r\nauthority. Shall we—can we honestly receive these benefits and repudiate\r\nour liabilities?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interview with ex-Governor Rufus B. Bullock, of Georgia, May 29th,\r\n1885:\r\n\r\nA reporter called upon ex-Governor Bullock at his rooms, Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel, and obtained the following interview:\r\n\r\n    Governor Bullock: “Any information in my possession is at your\r\n    service. I have published from time to time, over my own\r\n    signature, my views on this subject, and I have no objections to\r\n    repeating them. I desire to say, however, that I am in no wise a\r\n    party to the recent proceedings which have been had before the\r\n    Attorney-General of New York. I was in the city on private\r\n    business and without any previous knowledge of the proposed\r\n    hearing. I attended the hearing out of curiosity, expecting to\r\n    hear an argument by ex-Chief Justice Lochrane, and while there\r\n    was invited by the Acting Attorney-General to respond to his\r\n    inquiries. This I did with the result as reported in your\r\n    valuable paper. During my administration in 1868-’69-’70 and\r\n    ’71, bonds of the State were issued for State purposes, and the\r\n    endorsement of the State was placed upon certain railroad bonds\r\n    under the authority of law.\r\n\r\n    During the wild excitement that resulted in and followed the\r\n    overthrow of the Republican government in Georgia, nearly all\r\n    the acts of Republican administration were repudiated, among\r\n    them its financial transactions, and up to this day and hour the\r\n    questions of fact have never been permitted to reach any\r\n    judicial tribunal.\r\n\r\n    The people of New York State are fair-minded, law-abiding and\r\n    honest, and whenever they can be informed of the truth will\r\n    fearlessly follow it; but with regard to the real merits of this\r\n    repudiation, no light has reached them because our courts have\r\n    been closed.\r\n\r\n    It is asserted by the holders of these repudiated\r\n    obligations—and in this assertion I concur—that every bond was\r\n    issued in accordance with law, and that the State is now in the\r\n    enjoyment of the benefits resulting therefrom. In the exciting\r\n    times to which I have referred, a majority of the then\r\n    Legislature decided that the State was not bound by the acts of\r\n    its predecessors, and therefore these obligations were null and\r\n    void.\r\n\r\n    This is, of course, a question of law, and not of legislation. I\r\n    am sure that now, when partisan passion has subsided, both\r\n    parties to this controversy would cheerfully acquiesce in any\r\n    decision reached by our Supreme Court, and that the holders of\r\n    these defaulted securities would accept whatever is awarded them\r\n    in a long term bond at a low rate of interest, and on such an\r\n    adjustment all parties, at home and abroad, could unite in\r\n    maintaining the high financial credit to which the Empire State\r\n    of the South would then be entitled.\r\n\r\n    In December of last year the Atlanta _Constitution_, discussing\r\n    this subject, used the following language: “The burden of his\r\n    complaint is, that the bonds have never had a hearing in court.\r\n    This comes with poor grace from the ex-Governor, who, when the\r\n    validity of the bonds issued under his administration was being\r\n    discussed by the legislative committee, was absent from this\r\n    country, his whereabouts unknown, and his testimony not\r\n    procurable. The bonds were ‘in court’ then, and as Governor\r\n    Bullock was not present with his evidence when it was needed, he\r\n    should not complain that a new hearing is not had for his\r\n    benefit.” To this I made reply, which the _Constitution_ kindly\r\n    published, and I will thank you to copy as follows: “I desire to\r\n    say that I was not absent from the country. My whereabouts were\r\n    known, and my testimony was before the committee in the full and\r\n    complete report of the financial condition of the State which I\r\n    made to my successor, sustained by the official records of the\r\n    Executive and State Departments. I never received a request from\r\n    that committee to come before them in person, and my presence\r\n    would not have added to the information in their possession.\r\n    Every request received by me from my successors, to aid in their\r\n    investigations, has been promptly complied with. In accordance\r\n    with such request I met Dr. Bozeman, financial agent,\r\n    Attorney-General Hammond and Governor Smith, in New York, and\r\n    also subsequently, Colonel Snead, Attorney for the State, and\r\n    Colonel Kibbe, chairman of committee. No fact within my\r\n    knowledge has ever been withheld, nor have I ever neglected any\r\n    proper opportunity to contradict the statement that any of the\r\n    bonds issued during my administration and reported to my\r\n    successor were ‘bogus.’ But, Mr. Editor, the question is, shall\r\n    a debtor pass on the validity and enforce judgment against his\r\n    own indebtedness? I submit that a legislative investigating\r\n    committee is not ‘a court’ in the sense that its findings are\r\n    conclusive on questions of law. To hold a question so decided to\r\n    be _res adjudicata_, is to sustain a legislative usurpation of\r\n    the judicial functions of the government. If your position be\r\n    well taken, that because the Legislature has decided against the\r\n    bonds, the case is _res adjudicata_, and the judiciary is\r\n    precluded—of what avail is our constitutional guarantee that the\r\n    executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government\r\n    shall be separate and distinct, and that neither shall encroach\r\n    upon the functions of the other? What protection has a citizen\r\n    for his property if a legislative decision upon a legal question\r\n    must be regarded as final _res adjudicata_?\r\n\r\n    Does not the taking of other people’s money to build up our\r\n    railroads, and refusing those people a hearing in courts of our\r\n    own creation, before judges of our own election, indicate a want\r\n    of confidence in the justice of our cause? The Territory and\r\n    State of Minnesota used other people’s money to open up her\r\n    lands by the construction of railroads, just as Georgia did,\r\n    pledged the faith of the State for repayment, and then\r\n    repudiated, just as Georgia did. After twenty years’ delay,\r\n    justice has been done, and her obligations, as ascertained\r\n    through her court, have been paid. I have faith to believe that\r\n    the Empire State of the South will eventually keep pace with her\r\n    sister States in the Union in meting out exact justice through\r\n    her courts to every man, come from whence he may.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Hon. Wm. A. Post, Deputy Attorney-General of this State, by\r\n    appointment, visited this city last Friday to take evidence on\r\n    the Georgia repudiated bond question, the object being to\r\n    determine the legal status of a new issue of bonds by the State\r\n    of Georgia in connection with the savings banks of this State.\r\n    Owing to the repudiation of that State, at present these\r\n    institutions are debarred from investing in bonds of any\r\n    repudiating State, and the effort now is being made by the\r\n    representatives of the State of Georgia to remove that barrier,\r\n    so that the savings banks can be gutted of their surplus means\r\n    and filled up with the bonds issued by that State, which are\r\n    more than likely to share the wicked fate of repudiation, as\r\n    previous issues to the extent of $8,000,000 have done. The\r\n    savings banks managers, even in the event of obtaining a\r\n    decision authorizing them to take Georgia bonds for investment,\r\n    should be held personally liable for any losses that may fall\r\n    upon such institutions if they hereafter invest the funds of\r\n    widows and orphans in a security which, judging from past\r\n    experience, is almost sure to be wiped out and made worthless.\r\n    Mr. Clews charged that Mr. Calhoun’s appearance in representing\r\n    the State before the Attorney-General at Albany was a\r\n    surreptitious proceeding, and was only heard of by mere chance\r\n    by the holders of the repudiated bonds through a squib in a\r\n    Georgia paper. He also stated that the bondholders had patiently\r\n    waited twelve years for their money, and no body of creditors\r\n    had ever been so lenient as those of the State of Georgia, and\r\n    justice demanded that these long-suffering and much-defamed\r\n    creditors should be settled with prior to the financial world\r\n    according to the State of Georgia a sufficiently high credit to\r\n    admit of her floating any new issues of bonds. A motion was made\r\n    to adjourn the meeting until the 20th, which Mr. Post said he\r\n    would accede to after asking ex-Governor Bullock a few questions\r\n    in relation to the connection of the firm of Henry Clews & Co.\r\n    and the State of Georgia during the time he was its Governor. He\r\n    desired to make these inquiries now, as the ex-Governor was\r\n    present and might not be at the adjourned meeting. Mr. Clews\r\n    requested permission to state that his firm—Henry Clews &\r\n    Co.—had never been agents for the State of Georgia, but merely\r\n    acted for her as bankers and brokers. The agent of the State\r\n    during the entire period of Governor Bullock’s term of office\r\n    was the Fourth National Bank of this city. He stated that his\r\n    firm received no bonds, excepting by purchase or as collateral,\r\n    and advanced money to the State as it was needed. At one time\r\n    the State owed for said advances as much as $1,650,000; the\r\n    money so advanced was stated by Georgia’s officials as required\r\n    to meet the expenses of the government of the State. Ex-Governor\r\n    Bullock fully ratified Mr. Clews’ statement. He admitted that\r\n    the Fourth National Bank was the State financial agent, and that\r\n    he had placed a large quantity of bonds with Henry Clews & Co.\r\n    to market and as collateral for advances. “I will say,” said the\r\n    Governor, “that every dollar secured on the sale or pledge of\r\n    these bonds was received by the State, and it was expressly\r\n    agreed that the firm of Henry Clews & Co. should hold all the\r\n    bonds in their hands as security for the indebtedness due them\r\n    by the State of Georgia.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       GEORGIA’S OUTLAWED BONDS.\r\n\r\n    Newspapers in Atlanta, Savannah and other parts of Georgia have\r\n    violently assailed _The Graphic_ for its comments on the new\r\n    issue of Georgia State Bonds as affected by the repudiation of a\r\n    former issue. These journals are short-sighted, as are the\r\n    people of Georgia who imagine that they save money by outlawing\r\n    the obligations of their State issued in the usual manner. We\r\n    will not impute deliberate dishonesty to them, but they\r\n    certainly do not place their own motives in a favorable light\r\n    when they exclude the holders of the repudiated bonds from even\r\n    the right to present their claims before the civil courts of\r\n    Georgia. Ex-Governor Bullock has been berated in the same\r\n    connection, and he cogently replies:\r\n\r\n    “I have no pecuniary interest in the repudiated bonds or\r\n    obligations. I have no lot or part in any scheme or combination\r\n    by or through which public attention is or has been called to\r\n    this matter. My attitude is that of a private citizen who has as\r\n    high a regard for the honor and good name of Georgia as any man\r\n    within her borders. I never obtrude “the bond question” upon the\r\n    public attention. But when my official action is attacked in\r\n    that connection I shall never fail to assert and re-assert that\r\n    the financial statement made by me to my successor in office was\r\n    the exact truth and that its correctness never has and never\r\n    will be successfully controverted. In that financial statement\r\n    were many of the State obligations, which in a time of great\r\n    public excitement and partisan zeal were ‘outlawed’ by the\r\n    action of a political body, and up to this day and hour the\r\n    holders of such obligations have been denied that cool,\r\n    dispassionate hearing of their claims which our courts alone can\r\n    give. My ‘attitude’ is that Georgia is too great, that she\r\n    stands too prominent in this country and in the world at large\r\n    to accept the position of being a semi-annual defaulter and\r\n    refusing to the creditor a hearing in her own courts. It is idle\r\n    for me to assert or for you to deny the validity of the\r\n    defaulted securities. That is a question of law, and no Georgian\r\n    can defend his State while she slams the door of our courts in\r\n    the face of our creditors. I assert that it does make a vast\r\n    difference to Georgia whether her new securities are listed at\r\n    the Exchange in New York. Our own people or other people can, of\r\n    course, buy and own them, and I know the interest and principal\r\n    will surely be paid, but unless the bonds are ‘listed’ they are\r\n    not, in mercantile parlance, a ‘good delivery,’ and will not\r\n    stand abroad as they should, equal with the best State in the\r\n    Union.”\r\n\r\n    A State which once repudiates its obligations cannot be trusted\r\n    not to do the same thing again. What guarantee can any investor\r\n    have that the bonds which Georgia is now trying to put upon the\r\n    market may not be outlawed by the next Legislature? The\r\n    _Graphic_ has no interest in the matter beyond that of upholding\r\n    public morals, the good name of the State and the rights of\r\n    swindled creditors. The State which repudiates is as foolish as\r\n    the imbecile who cut off his nose to spite his face.—_N. Y.\r\n    Graphic_, June 6th, 1885.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The extreme care with which so-called securities or new issues\r\n    of bonds are scrutinized in this market nowadays is shown in the\r\n    opposition which has sprung up to the proposed listing on the\r\n    New York Stock Exchange of $3,500,000 new Georgia State bonds.\r\n    While money is a glut in the markets and our banks are now\r\n    carrying a larger idle reserve than ever before known in the\r\n    history of business, there is no disposition to permit Southern\r\n    repudiators to come in and secure any part of the funds. The\r\n    application to the Attorney-General to permit our savings banks\r\n    to “invest” in the bonds, and the request that they be listed in\r\n    the Stock Exchange, aroused New York bankers to action, and\r\n    their opposition has been so far very effective. It has had this\r\n    good, at least, that it has revived attention in regard to the\r\n    repudiation of old obligations of Southern States. By its act of\r\n    repudiation, Georgia mulcted the New York investors to the tune\r\n    of millions. I know of one banker who now holds more than\r\n    $2,500,000 of these bonds, on which there is an interest\r\n    accumulation of twelve years’ duration, and at least three\r\n    leading financial institutions were carried to the wall by the\r\n    same means. Now, it is considered very poor grace for the modern\r\n    Christian statesmen of Georgia to pass around the hat again. Let\r\n    the State first repudiate its repudiation, pay up old scores,\r\n    and then it will be quite early enough to ask for further loans.\r\n    The argument that the credit of the State is really benefited by\r\n    the repudiation, as she has so much less obligations to meet, is\r\n    a quaint one, and worthy the source from which it emanates. This\r\n    is not the sort of “prosperity” that invites further investment\r\n    of Northern funds.—_Syracuse, N. Y., Sunday Herald._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GEORGIA BONDS.\r\n\r\n    When a Georgia bond is put on the market, our Democratic friends\r\n    cry out “Great is the Credit of Georgia.” They claim that\r\n    Georgia pays all of her obligations whenever they are due,\r\n    knowing their claim to be utterly false. Georgia has not only\r\n    repudiated legal obligations, in the hands of innocent\r\n    purchasers, but she denies the parties who have paid value for\r\n    her bonds the right to take the judgment of her own courts on\r\n    the validity of those bonds. So in the bond business the State\r\n    of Georgia acts not only the role of the thief and robber, but\r\n    also of the coward. The man who claims that Georgia meets all\r\n    her obligations is simply a liar.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Respecting State securities, investors are showing a very proper\r\n    discrimination against the issues of States tainted with\r\n    repudiation. The action of the Superintendent of the Banking\r\n    Department of this State, in forbidding savings institutions\r\n    from investing in the new issues of the bonds of Georgia, has\r\n    attracted attention to the danger of investments thus tainted,\r\n    and is very generally approved by the investing public as a\r\n    check to future acts of this kind. The disposition shown by\r\n    certain managers of savings banks to put the funds in their\r\n    charge into such doubtful securities should be strongly\r\n    condemned; and it is a question whether it is not necessary, as\r\n    a protection to such depositors, to make such a use of the\r\n    deposits of the poorer classes a penal offence.—_Weekly\r\n    Financial Circular of Henry Clews & Co., June 6th, 1885._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                 HOW THE GEORGIA BONDS WERE NEGOTIATED.\r\n\r\nThe following circular explains the manner in which the Georgia bonds\r\nwere negotiated with my firm:\r\n\r\n                                             NEW YORK, July 3, 1885.\r\n\r\n    HON. WM. A. POST,\r\n\r\n    _Deputy Attorney-General, State of New York_:\r\n\r\n    The firm of Henry Clews & Co. did not solicit the account of the\r\n    State of Georgia, but it was opened at the request of Mr. I. C.\r\n    Plant, the leading private banker of Macon, Ga., and the most\r\n    influential and affluent banker of the State of Georgia then and\r\n    at the present time. Mr. Plant was brought to my office by Mr.\r\n    P. C. Calhoun, President of the Fourth National Bank, which\r\n    institution was the financial agent of the State of Georgia at\r\n    the time. Mr. Calhoun introduced Mr. Plant to me, by giving that\r\n    gentleman a very strong endorsement, and stated that Mr. Plant\r\n    was in this city for the purpose of raising money for the State\r\n    of Georgia, which money was required to pay off the members of\r\n    the Legislature. Mr. Calhoun stated that his bank had loaned to\r\n    Mr. Plant $400,000 on currency 7 per cent. Georgia bonds, and as\r\n    money was very stringent at the present time and the calls were\r\n    very numerous, he felt as though $400,000 was as much as he\r\n    ought to loan in any one quarter. “But if you have any money,\r\n    Mr. Clews, that you are willing to loan at the present time, if\r\n    you will accommodate Mr. Plant, it may result in your doing some\r\n    good business with the State of Georgia. I would say,” said he,\r\n    “that you cannot advance money in any quarter where it would be\r\n    safer than to loan on the Georgia State bonds which Mr. Plant\r\n    will offer you. I know the State of Georgia well. I have ridden\r\n    on horseback over almost every foot of ground in the State in my\r\n    early life in my collecting trips. My father was in the saddlery\r\n    and hardware business, and the larger part of his business was\r\n    in that State. I know the people of this State; and as an\r\n    evidence of my opinion of the future of this State and its\r\n    bonds, I will say that if I had my choice to put my money into\r\n    these bonds of the State of Georgia, or those of the State of\r\n    New York, to leave to my family, I would give the bonds of\r\n    Georgia the preference, for the reason that her debt is so small\r\n    as compared with the debt of the State of New York at the\r\n    present time, and the future of the State of Georgia is destined\r\n    to be one of great prosperity.” Mr. Plant then said: “Mr. Clews,\r\n    Mr. Calhoun has advanced $400,000 towards the amount I need, and\r\n    I want $250,000 in addition. I know the money market is very\r\n    tight [as it was at that time, money being worth 7 per cent. per\r\n    annum and 1 per cent. per day commission]; still, I think, if\r\n    you will loan this money to the State of Georgia, that it will\r\n    enable you to make a connection which will prove profitable to\r\n    you in the end.” I said: “Very well, Mr. Plant, I will make the\r\n    loan to the State of the $250,000 which you require.” Mr. Plant\r\n    then said: “Well, place it to the credit of the State of\r\n    Georgia, and I will bring in 500,000 of Georgia 7 per cent.\r\n    currency bonds, the same character of bonds which have been\r\n    lodged as collateral with the Fourth National Bank. I will go at\r\n    once to the Fourth National Bank, where they are, and bring them\r\n    down here;” which he did. The $250,000 was then placed to the\r\n    credit of the State and a telegram to that effect was sent to\r\n    the Governor, and it was at once drawn out on the official\r\n    drafts of the State. This started a correspondence with Governor\r\n    Bullock, in his official capacity, he being entirely unknown to\r\n    me before. Other applications were then made direct by the\r\n    Governor for additional loans, which were made from time to\r\n    time, until the amount so advanced reached to $1,650,000. After\r\n    receiving, in addition to the 500,000 bonds referred to, 800,000\r\n    more of similar bonds came into our possession from time to time\r\n    as collateral, being put up at 50 cents on the dollar; and when\r\n    we afterwards received a large installment of the gold quarterly\r\n    7 per cent. bonds, having at that time an excess of collateral\r\n    in our hands, we voluntarily forwarded to the State 500,000 of\r\n    the Currency 7s. This was precisely and exactly the way my\r\n    firm’s connection was commenced with the State of Georgia. Mr.\r\n    I. C. Plant, who is still a banker of Macon, Ga., I am sure,\r\n    will testify to the correctness of my statements.\r\n\r\n    The State of Georgia gold 7 per cent. quarterly interest bonds\r\n    were placed by the Governor of Georgia in my firm’s hands as\r\n    additional collateral against the advances made to the State,\r\n    with full instructions to sell same and credit avails.\r\n    Application was made by request of Governor Bullock to have this\r\n    issue of bonds placed on the regular list of the New York Stock\r\n    Exchange, and after a full investigation by that body, they were\r\n    admitted. A portion of these gold bonds were sold in this\r\n    country and the balance in Europe. When the Georgia Bond\r\n    Committee came here 77,000 of these bonds were in Europe in the\r\n    banker’s hands there for sale, and my New York firm held 25,000,\r\n    all others received having been sold. These 102 bonds were\r\n    reported to this committee as unsold at that time, but soon\r\n    thereafter, and before the Act of repudiation was passed by the\r\n    Georgia Legislature, these 102 bonds were sold and reported as\r\n    sold, and I think the price was 97½, and the State’s account was\r\n    credited with the avails, and the proper authorities of the\r\n    State were duly notified thereof. Up to the time of sale of\r\n    these 102 bonds our standing order to sell continued and was\r\n    never revoked; because, however, these 102,000 had been reported\r\n    to the Georgia Bond Committee when in this city as being on hand\r\n    at that time, they were repudiated, together with the other\r\n    bonds which we were supposed to still hold. The New York Stock\r\n    Exchange was called upon by the Treasurer of the State of\r\n    Georgia to order struck from the list these 102 bonds, and the\r\n    Exchange was compelled to be governed thereby, as official\r\n    notice had been received of their repudiation. The following\r\n    were the numbers of these bonds * * * * You will perceive that\r\n    the numbers are not consecutive, thus showing that they were not\r\n    the last of the bonds placed in our hands. The low numbers were\r\n    received first and the highest numbers last, in the deliveries\r\n    made to us by Governor Bullock. Under this statement of facts,\r\n    which I am prepared to prove, I insist that these 102,000 bonds\r\n    are as binding upon the State of Georgia as any of those which\r\n    are now recognized. My fellow members of the Stock Exchange who\r\n    have made investigation fully confirm this opinion. A large\r\n    number of the coupons of these bonds were paid by the State on\r\n    these 102,000 bonds, thus showing the State’s recognition of\r\n    them at one time. My firm repeatedly called upon the officials\r\n    of the State of Georgia to pay the balance due, but we could get\r\n    no response. After waiting patiently a very long time, we called\r\n    in eminent counsel for advice in this matter, and under said\r\n    advice the Governor and Treasurer of the State of Georgia were\r\n    notified in the regular legal form that if the said indebtedness\r\n    was not paid on or before a specified date the collateral in our\r\n    hands, each item being specified, belonging to the State, would\r\n    be sold at public auction at the Merchants’ Exchange Rooms, 111\r\n    Broadway, at 12 o’clock, by A. H. Muller & Sons, auctioneers.\r\n    This notice of said sale, together with list of securities, was\r\n    inserted in the newspapers; the sale took place, and the 800,000\r\n    Currency and other bonds were disposed of to the highest\r\n    bidders, and the State’s account credited with the avails. All\r\n    these securities should be considered, therefore, as having\r\n    passed out of my firm’s possession and in the hands of other\r\n    holders for value. The State of Georgia in this matter is\r\n    certainly amenable to New York laws, and the entire business was\r\n    conducted in accordance with said law. Governor Bullock’s\r\n    successors did all they could to depreciate the securities\r\n    issued by their predecessors, and are responsible for the low\r\n    prices which the State of Georgia bonds afterward sold for, as\r\n    during Governor Bullock’s administration the State 7s were at\r\n    about par and the first mortgage Brunswick & Albany bonds,\r\n    guaranteed by the State, sold at 90 and upwards. As an evidence\r\n    of the high credit which my firm had worked up for the State, we\r\n    bought out the first million issued of Brunswick & Albany First\r\n    bonds guaranteed by the State of Georgia, in the Berlin and\r\n    Frankfort markets at 104, and there were seven millions of bids\r\n    therefor, and the one million had to be distributed _pro rata_\r\n    amongst the said bidders. In testimony of the correctness of\r\n    this statement, I refer you to Mr. Budge, the head active\r\n    partner of Hallgarten & Co., and Mr. Schiff the head active\r\n    partner of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., of this city, who were interested\r\n    with me, and through these two gentlemen the bonds were sold.\r\n    After this great success, I ask you, or any fair-minded man, was\r\n    not my firm entitled to continue to advance upon Brunswick &\r\n    Albany first mortgage bonds endorsed by Georgia? and as the 275\r\n    Cartersville & Van Wert bonds, endorsed by the State of Georgia,\r\n    were offered to my firm shortly after this signal success as\r\n    collateral, were they not also equally justified in advancing\r\n    167,000 upon them? and _in that_ way, and in that alone, these\r\n    securities came into our hands. I most positively assert that my\r\n    firm never had any other pecuniary interests but as herewith set\r\n    forth in these two enterprises. At the time of the repudiation\r\n    of the State, my firm held\r\n\r\n            750,000 Brunswick & Albany first mortgage bonds,\r\n                      endorsed             by State of Georgia.\r\n\r\n            275,000 Cartersville & Van Wert first mortgage bonds,\r\n                      endorsed             by State of Georgia.\r\n\r\n            587,000 State of Georgia Gold 7s.\r\n\r\n            350,000 Brunswick & Albany first mortgage bonds.\r\n\r\n            400,000 Coupons cashed by us on the State of Georgia\r\n                                 securities, but a legal claim\r\n                      against the State.\r\n\r\n            800,000 State of Georgia Currency 7s.\r\n\r\n                 ——\r\n\r\n          3,162,000\r\n\r\n    Also, a judgment of 525,000 obtained in favor of Henry Clews &\r\n    Co. in the State courts of Georgia against the Brunswick &\r\n    Albany Railroad Company, being an amount due my firm over and\r\n    above all securities in our hands. My firm also obtained in the\r\n    United States District Court of Georgia a judgment to secure our\r\n    advances of 167,000 to the Cartersville & Van Wert Company.\r\n    Neither of these judgments have ever been satisfied.\r\n\r\n    This leaves out entirely the 102,000 Georgia 7s (quarterlies),\r\n    as well as many other scattering lots of different issues of\r\n    the State of Georgia securities. The past due bonds referred\r\n    to by Mr. Hammond were being hawked about, both here and in\r\n    London, for the purpose of forcing their payment, and the\r\n    holders threatened to use them to interfere with the sale of\r\n    the gold 7s which we were about to bring out in this and\r\n    foreign markets. I mentioned this matter to Governor Bullock\r\n    when on a visit here. He then directed me to buy up such of\r\n    these bonds which were in troublesome hands, and as they were\r\n    a demand claim against funds then in the State Treasury, all\r\n    you have to do, he said, is to charge up the amount which you\r\n    paid for said bonds to the State’s account and retain in your\r\n    hands the bonds as collateral, and when the State is flush\r\n    enough I’ll see that you are paid direct from the Treasury.\r\n    These past due bonds belonged to us, and were taken up by our\r\n    money and not the State’s; the 98,000 which were cancelled,\r\n    which Mr. Hammond refers to, were so cancelled by error, which\r\n    I am fully prepared at any time to prove. The depreciation in\r\n    Georgia State bonds which Mr. Hammond refers to did not exist\r\n    during Governor Bullock’s administration, but was brought\r\n    about by his successors in office, as they did all they\r\n    possibly could to depreciate the bonds of the State authorized\r\n    and issued by the previous Legislature.\r\n\r\n                             I have the honor to remain,\r\n\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n             GEORGIA SECURITIES AND NEW YORK SAVINGS BANKS.\r\n\r\n    The efforts that are being made to place Georgia securities in\r\n    the savings banks of New York ought to be resisted for two very\r\n    good reasons: First, such investment would be contrary to the\r\n    law of the State; second, even if it were legal it would be\r\n    imprudent and unsafe.\r\n\r\n    As to the authority of our savings banks to invest in these\r\n    securities, it is understood that the opinion of the\r\n    Attorney-General has been asked. On this point there is not much\r\n    room for question. Savings banks are prohibited by law from\r\n    investing in the stocks or bonds of any State that has within\r\n    ten years defaulted in the payment of any part of the principal\r\n    or interest of its debt. By a constitutional amendment adopted\r\n    in 1877, Georgia ratified previous acts of the Legislature\r\n    repudiating more than eight millions of its obligations. The\r\n    excuse given for this proceeding was that the State’s\r\n    obligations had not been lawfully contracted, and therefore were\r\n    not binding. On this ground it is claimed that Georgia\r\n    securities do not fall within the prohibition put by the law\r\n    upon the savings banks of New York. There would be some force in\r\n    this view if Georgia were sustained by any judicial decision\r\n    holding the bonds invalid. But it took advantage of that\r\n    principal which protects a State against suit by a citizen. It\r\n    decided the question by its own arbitrary edict It gave its\r\n    victimized creditors no voice in the matter. In the absence of\r\n    judicial support or warrant, its action can be regarded only as\r\n    a repudiation.\r\n\r\n    But if there were no legal obstacle in the way, prudence alone\r\n    should deter any savings institution from investing in the bonds\r\n    of a State that has so recently broken its faith and repudiated\r\n    its obligations. The managers of a savings bank hold an\r\n    exceptional trust. These institutions are the depositories of\r\n    the earnings of the poor. The first consideration in their\r\n    management is safety. With that end in view the law imposes the\r\n    most stringent regulations on their supervision and the\r\n    disposition of their funds. Their investments are properly\r\n    restricted to the safest and most unquestionable securities.\r\n    There is neither authority nor excuse for taking any risk. Let\r\n    individuals, if they wish, invest in Georgia bonds. That is\r\n    their own business. But the managers of a savings bank cannot\r\n    run any such risk without failing in their duty to thousands of\r\n    poor depositors.—_N. Y. Herald, July 17, 1885._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL’S DECISION.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Attorney-General, as was expected, wisely prohibited\r\nthe savings banks of this State from risking any of the hard earnings of\r\ntheir large number of depositors in such an uncertain security as\r\nGeorgia bonds.\r\n\r\nThe Bank Superintendent, Willis S. Paine, referring in his report of\r\nMarch, 1886, to this decision, says:\r\n\r\n    “For some time there has been a determined effort to have the\r\n    bonds issued by the State of Georgia accepted as a lawful\r\n    investment for savings banks of this State. My predecessor in\r\n    office declined to recognize their legal right to invest in\r\n    bonds of the State mentioned. Late in 1885 the State issued a\r\n    considerable amount of bonds, which were offered to the savings\r\n    banks on terms advantageous to them, and there was a desire on\r\n    the part of some of the banks to purchase the bonds. The matter\r\n    was by me referred to the Attorney-General to determine whether\r\n    the State had defaulted. Several hearings were had, at which the\r\n    various interests involved were represented by eminent counsel.\r\n    The conclusions reached by the Attorney-General were based upon\r\n    a consideration of the facts and circumstances relating to the\r\n    issue by the State of Georgia of its guarantee of $1,500,000 of\r\n    bonds of the Brunswick and Albany railroad, which he holds are\r\n    in default of interest, the principal not yet being due. He\r\n    reaches the conclusion that at least in the case of the bonds\r\n    issued or indorsed in aid of the Brunswick and Albany railroad\r\n    it has defaulted, and this brings the case within the\r\n    prohibition of the statute of New York regulating investments by\r\n    trustees of savings banks. He therefore concludes that the\r\n    savings banks of New York may not lawfully invest their deposits\r\n    in the bonds of the State of Georgia.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          GEORGIA’S NEW ISSUE.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made last summer to have several millions of the new\r\nissue of Georgia bonds listed on the Stock Exchange in a second hand\r\nstyle, through the instrumentality of Mr. Fred. Wolf, who was presumably\r\nan innocent holder of these bonds. On this occasion I addressed to the\r\nGoverning Committee the following protest:\r\n\r\n                                            June 22, 1886.\r\n\r\n    _To the Governing Committee of the N. Y. Stock Exchange_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIRS:—I have just been informed, whether correctly or not,\r\n    that, not the State of Georgia, but a person by the name of Mr.\r\n    Fred. Wolf, of this city, has applied to your Committee to list\r\n    $3,300,000 State of Georgia 4½ per cent. bonds, and sets forth\r\n    that said bonds are to take up those of the State maturing in\r\n    February, April and July. I am advised that the bonds which\r\n    matured, during the two months first named, long since past,\r\n    have already been taken up by the State, so there remains but\r\n    those which mature on the 1st of July next outstanding of the\r\n    class of bonds referred to. At the time I was instrumental in\r\n    defeating the State of Georgia from removing a very necessary\r\n    restriction imposed by a New York State law from lodging these\r\n    same bonds upon the savings banks, the officials of the State of\r\n    Georgia exulted over the fact that the said defeat in no way\r\n    injured the State of Georgia, as the bonds had already been\r\n    disposed of at a satisfactory price to the State, and therefore\r\n    no longer belonged to them; thus showing that the State of\r\n    Georgia does not make the application for the admission of these\r\n    bonds to the Exchange, but clearly shows that they are in\r\n    possession of the avails of these said bonds to provide for; not\r\n    only those that had matured but those that are due on the 1st of\r\n    July next, consequently it takes away the necessity of the State\r\n    having the application now made favorably acted upon by your\r\n    Committee. Mr. Wolf, therefore, makes the application in his own\r\n    behalf, doubtless to enable him to extricate himself from his\r\n    own speculative venture in these so-called securities, which he\r\n    was in hopes when he took them of turning over to certain saving\r\n    banks who, by the Attorney-General’s opinion, were precluded\r\n    from buying these identical bonds, which misfortune, from the\r\n    statements made by the officials of the State of Georgia, falls\r\n    not upon them but the party who has bought the bonds. As the\r\n    original plan of lodging these bonds in the savings banks was a\r\n    failure and the poor people’s money on deposit there was saved\r\n    from wreck thereby, it is now sought to land them upon others,\r\n    providing the New York Stock Exchange can be secured to give\r\n    character to them by listing them as is now attempted. My firm\r\n    represents two seats on the New York Stock Exchange and has\r\n    large interest there and I protest against the proposition to\r\n    list these Georgia bonds for regular dealings at the Exchange,\r\n    as the State of Georgia is not only in default in payment of her\r\n    bonds, both principal and interest, and long since past due, but\r\n    besides has repudiated eight millions of her bonded debt which\r\n    were issued for value received under the great seal of the\r\n    commonwealth, properly signed, legally issued and in the hands\r\n    of innocent parties who have acquired vested rights therein,\r\n    and, therefore, are the victims of a gigantic robbery by the\r\n    repudiation of said bonds. It is but fair to assume that a State\r\n    which undertakes to blot out by a legislative act, without being\r\n    willing to submit any questions at issue to the judiciary—who\r\n    alone have the right to decide upon such questions—find _that_\r\n    to be so simple a method of paying debts will not unlikely be\r\n    tempted to repeat repudiation often in the future. These bonds\r\n    now attempted to be foisted on the public cannot, by any\r\n    possibility, be expected to have any greater permanency of value\r\n    than those that have already received the shameful fate of being\r\n    reduced by repudiation to the value of brown paper. I foresee,\r\n    therefore, that if the N. Y. Stock Exchange lists this new issue\r\n    of bonds, that by fictitious methods quotations may be obtained,\r\n    and in all probability the members of the N. Y. Stock Exchange\r\n    be induced to deal in them and suffer the cruel loss that has\r\n    already been my fate. The State of Georgia, with interest to\r\n    date, owes me and my old firm at least five million dollars;\r\n    therefore, I have a right, owing to my large interests in the\r\n    Stock Exchange, to urge that the application to list these new\r\n    Georgia bonds be denied, for I fear that should it be otherwise,\r\n    many of the members whose seats are in part security for\r\n    transactions, may be tempted to deal in these so-called\r\n    “securities” and suffer great loss if not ruin thereby, for when\r\n    the time of repudiation takes place the security in their seats\r\n    at the Exchange may be made valueless through said loss to\r\n    honest creditors. When the State of Georgia wipes out the\r\n    disgraceful blot of repudiation which now stains the escutcheon\r\n    of the commonwealth, she will then be entitled to have the\r\n    facility which the New York Stock Exchange has the power of\r\n    granting, to aid her in restoring her credit to rank alongside\r\n    others. She will then be entitled to credit on a 3 per cent.\r\n    basis similar to the States of New York, Massachusetts, Maryland\r\n    and many others, _but not before_.\r\n\r\n                                  Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    SHALL REPUDIATION BE RECOGNIZED\r\n\r\n                                            NEW YORK, June 25, 1886.\r\n\r\n    _To the Governing Committee of the N. Y. Stock Exchange_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:—I send you an exact copy, published in the _Graphic_\r\n    newspaper under date of June 15th, 1886, of a bond issued by the\r\n    State of Georgia, which you will perceive is an out-and-out\r\n    State bond and represents an issue of 1,800 bonds of $1,000\r\n    each. The act of authorization of the State was passed upon by\r\n    the eminent legal firm of Evarts, Southmayd & Choate, also by\r\n    the late Judge Emott as being in conformity with law and in\r\n    every respect a regular and legally issued bond of that State.\r\n    The innocent holders of these bonds are the following:\r\n\r\n                  The Broadway National       $200,000\r\n                    Bank\r\n\r\n                  The Metropolitan Savings     100,000\r\n                    Bank\r\n\r\n                  The Brooklyn Trust Co        100,000\r\n\r\n                  Russell Sage                 200,000\r\n\r\n                  Henry Clews & Co             486,000\r\n\r\n                  The Union Trust Co           100,000\r\n\r\n                  Ezra A. Boody                200,000\r\n\r\n                  Richard Irvin & Co           133,000\r\n\r\n                  The Commercial Warehouse     200,000\r\n                    Co. about\r\n\r\n    The balance is in small lots scattered in numerous hands. None\r\n    of these bonds was disposed of for less than 90 cents in money.\r\n    The Broadway Bank loaned $160,000 upon theirs, taking them as\r\n    collateral. Some other institutions held them as collateral\r\n    against advances similar to that of the Broadway Bank. The whole\r\n    of this issue was repudiated by the State.\r\n\r\n    The State of Georgia also notified the Exchange that a large\r\n    number of bonds known as Quarterly Gold Georgia Bonds were also\r\n    repudiated. The numbers of these bonds were scattered in amongst\r\n    an issue of two and one-half millions of that class of bonds,\r\n    all of which were long previously admitted to dealings at the N.\r\n    Y. Stock Exchange. The N. Y. Stock Exchange having received\r\n    notice from the State that they had been repudiated, ordered\r\n    them stricken from the list. These bonds are all in the hands of\r\n    innocent, _bona fide_ holders, who paid in the neighborhood of\r\n    par for them in all instances and the avails therefor were\r\n    received by the State.\r\n\r\n    Those not repudiated of these issues have since and are now\r\n    daily quoted at the N. Y. Stock Exchange, the price being at the\r\n    present time nominally about 112.\r\n\r\n    I have only noted a part of the bonds repudiated by the State of\r\n    Georgia, so that you may be convinced of the fact that the bonds\r\n    are out-and-out State bonds and just as good an obligation\r\n    issued under the great seal of the commonwealth of Georgia and\r\n    as absolutely binding upon the State as the new bonds which are\r\n    now attempted to be listed; and should the latter be listed, the\r\n    chances are that they will share the same fate as those noted.\r\n\r\n    If a State can issue such obligations, and wipe them out by an\r\n    act of repudiation with impunity, and the Stock Exchange ignore\r\n    such shameful conduct, there will then be no safety in buying\r\n    bonds issued by any State, as it is thereby made to appear that\r\n    there is no stain left upon her escutcheon, the evidence of\r\n    which is that the N. Y. Stock Exchange has backed them up in\r\n    their action. Under the Constitution which gives sovereign\r\n    rights to States a citizen holding these repudiated obligations\r\n    cannot sue a State, therefore there is no redress for a great\r\n    wrong done.\r\n\r\n    I shall be glad to appear before your Committee and give you all\r\n    the evidence in the case before you decide upon the application\r\n    now before you to admit $3,300,000 Georgia 4½ per cent. bonds.\r\n\r\n                                  Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     A REMINDER TO SENATOR EVARTS.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this Georgia bond affair, even at the expense of\r\nstringing the subject out to a considerable length, I cannot omit the\r\nfollowing communication to Senator Evarts on the subject:\r\n\r\n                                           NEW YORK, April 13, 1886.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. William M. Evarts, Washington, D. C._:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR—It is quite generally understood, from information\r\n    lately received here from Washington, that there is soon to be\r\n    sprung upon Congress a bill providing for large appropriations\r\n    for the improvement of rivers and harbors and other so-called\r\n    public improvements in the South. There is a feeling of strong\r\n    opposition in financial circles in this city against the justice\r\n    of the General Government making such appropriations to many of\r\n    the Southern States at the present time. This opposition is\r\n    based upon the fact that the State of New York contributes by\r\n    taxation about one-fifth of all the revenue raised in this\r\n    country which provides for the expenses incurred in carrying on\r\n    the Government, so that whatever moneys are spent for the\r\n    so-called public improvements, at least one-fifth of the amount\r\n    is extracted from the pockets of the citizens of this State,\r\n    through taxation; and as many of our citizens have been so\r\n    villainously victimized by the repudiation of the Southern\r\n    States, especially by the State of Georgia, it is but just and\r\n    fair to these victims, therefore, that no appropriations of\r\n    money for the purposes named should pass Congress for the\r\n    benefit of any State which is at present under repudiation. It\r\n    is eminently proper that Congress should take a stand against\r\n    this, as the very people who have been so robbed are to pay the\r\n    cost. A large number of them have been ruined, as a penalty for\r\n    believing in the honor and good faith of Southern States, and\r\n    while such claims remain unpaid, it certainly does appear harsh\r\n    that these citizens should be taxed by the General Government\r\n    and compelled to contribute to funds to be appropriated for the\r\n    benefit of States now in default of both principal and interest\r\n    for bonds issued by them under proper legislative authority and\r\n    bearing the great seal of the commonwealth. The money paid for\r\n    these bonds by confiding people has gone into public\r\n    improvements in those States. If the Government desires to make\r\n    appropriations, they should be made to the holders of these\r\n    bonds, and the share to the various States be in their own bonds\r\n    in place of money. The States thereby would take the place of\r\n    the present holders. When repudiated bonds are all extinguished\r\n    it will be time for the Government to begin the appropriation of\r\n    money direct. No greater public improvement for the South, as\r\n    well as for the credit of the entire country, would equal the\r\n    removal from the various States of the blot of repudiation which\r\n    now stains their escutcheons, and reflects most injuriously upon\r\n    the credit of the General Government itself.\r\n\r\n                                  Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        ANOTHER STRONG PROTEST.\r\n\r\n                                                  September 2, 1886.\r\n\r\n    _James D.

JOHNSON CAME TO VISIT NEW YORK ON\r\n    HIS REMARKABLE TOUR.—THE GRAND RECEPTION AT DELMONICO’S.—THE\r\n    PRESIDENT LOSES HIS TEMPER AT ALBANY AND BECOMES AN OBJECT OF PUBLIC\r\n    RIDICULE.—HIS PROCLAMATION OF “MY POLICY” IRONICALLY\r\n    RECEIVED.—RETURNS TO WASHINGTON DISGRACED.—THE MASSACRE OF NEW\r\n    ORLEANS.—THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have attributed the ill luck of myself and others in certain\r\nbusiness ventures in Southern securities to President Andrew Johnson, it\r\nwill be necessary to describe some of the vagaries of that gentleman\r\nwhich had such a ruinous effect upon the investments of Northern men in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nIn common with several other Wall Street men, I had an idea that the\r\nPresident might be favorably affected by the social influence of the\r\nNorth, if that were brought to bear upon him in the right way. So when\r\nwe heard that he had been invited to attend the laying of the\r\ncorner-stone in the erection of a monument to the memory of Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, at Chicago, I got up a paper signed by several Wall Street men\r\nand other prominent citizens, urging the President to accept said\r\ninvitation and also invited him to stop at New York, on his way to the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was graciously accepted, and preparations were made at\r\nonce to give him a suitable reception. It was hoped that this\r\ndemonstration of our good will would have the effect of smoothing down\r\nthe asperities of the President, and that it might remove any harsh\r\nfeelings that he entertained towards the members of Congress who\r\nrepresented the Eastern and Western sections, and hence prove a means of\r\ninducing him to advise the people of the South, over whom he had\r\nconsiderable influence, to lay aside their sentiments of hostility and\r\nattend to their business interests in a manner that should redound to\r\nthe mutual benefit of the two great sections of the country. This was in\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nThe President left Washington about the end of August, accompanied by\r\nGeneral Grant, Admiral Farragut, Secretary Wells, Postmaster Randall,\r\nand a few others of less note.\r\n\r\nWhen the party arrived in New York it was joined by Secretary of State\r\nSeward.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the President’s reception were on a magnificent\r\nscale for that time, and the people turned out _en masse_ eagerly to do\r\nhonor to the Executive of the nation. There was a grand procession which\r\nconducted him to the City Hall, where he was received by the officials\r\nof the City and State, and the procession afterwards escorted him to\r\nDelmonico’s, at Fourteenth Street and Fifth avenue, where a dinner was\r\nserved in the most sumptuous style, with every mark of honor and respect\r\nbefitting the distinguished guest and his numerous friends.\r\n\r\nThere was an address of welcome pertinent to the occasion, and the\r\nPresident responded in a very happy style. This was said to have been\r\none of his best efforts in oratory, in which he was, at times,\r\nexceedingly forcible and persuasive.\r\n\r\nHe was always pithy and powerful, and there has perhaps never been a\r\nPresident who produced stronger, more brilliant, and more argumentative\r\nstate papers than Andrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe audience at Delmonico’s was thoroughly delighted with him, the\r\ndinner came off in a way that left nothing to be desired, and everything\r\nseemed to indicate that the presidential visit would be a potent\r\ninfluence in creating a new era of harmony between the two hostile\r\ndivisions of the country.\r\n\r\nEverything was lovely until the presidential party arrived at Albany,\r\nwhen it became manifest that the President had set out with the full\r\nintention of giving the journey the aspect of a political canvass, and\r\nof taking occasion to abuse his enemies in the strongest terms, and to\r\nvindicate his policy of reconstruction in opposition to that of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe crowd which met him on his arrival at Albany was immense, and on the\r\nwhole was disposed to accord the President a kind and courteous welcome.\r\n\r\nThe President was called upon to make a speech, in which he made violent\r\nattacks upon his supposed enemies, or those who opposed his policy,\r\nthereby sinking beneath the dignity which he was expected to maintain as\r\nPresident of the United States, to the level of a mere political\r\ndemagogue. His utterances in that motley assembly, of course, were soon\r\nmet by sharp opposition. There were many, however, who did not treat the\r\nfiery demonstration of the President seriously, and several of the crowd\r\nindulged in the pastime of firing off a few good-natured jokes at the\r\ntailor of Tennessee, who, by a mysterious fate, had been raised to such\r\na dizzy eminence. These jests were taken seriously by the President,\r\nwhose hot Southern blood became so aroused that he forgot the dignity of\r\nhis office and station and condescended to bandy words, and exchange\r\nterms of ribaldry with people in the crowd. He then became a butt for\r\nsavage ridicule. A small black flag was exhibited which seemed to have\r\nthe same effect upon him as a red rag has upon a Texan steer.\r\n\r\nThe President became furious, and losing entire control of himself,\r\npointed towards a man in the crowd saying, “Who is that man who dares to\r\nhoist that black flag. Let him come up here and I will tell him what I\r\nthink of him.”\r\n\r\nThis descent of personal dignity on the part of the President was\r\nreceived by the audience with a feeling of ineffable disgust. He had\r\nstooped beneath the level of the average electioneering stump speaker.\r\nHe was greeted with jeers and hooting, and the meeting was turned into a\r\nroaring farce, in which the President played harlequin, to the great\r\ndelight of the ignorant element in the crowd, and the terrible\r\nmortification of those who had conducted him thither.\r\n\r\nHis friends were greatly incensed at his conduct. My business friends\r\nand I were heartily sorry that we had anything to do with this unruly\r\nExecutive, who had evidently lost his head through the sudden\r\nacquisition of power.\r\n\r\nThe President’s journey was continued to Chicago by way of Cleveland,\r\nwhere he made similar outbursts to those displayed at Albany. By the\r\ntime he had reached Chicago he had become a public object of ridicule.\r\nHe spoke so vociferously about “my policy” that the very boys in the\r\nstreets began to utter these words ironically and jeeringly.\r\n\r\nThe tour of the President was designated “Swinging around the circle,”\r\nand when he returned to Washington he had become an object of national\r\ncontempt, and the majority of the people had entirely lost confidence in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne thing about this time that intensified the popular feeling of\r\nhostility against him was the attitude he assumed concerning the\r\nmassacre of New Orleans, which occurred about a month before he started\r\non his political tour.\r\n\r\nThe Convention which had formed the free constitution of the State of\r\nLouisiana in 1864 had been ordered to reassemble by its President. The\r\nConfederate sympathizers, who had been greatly encouraged by the acts of\r\nthe President to keep alive their old feelings of hostility to the\r\nNorth, resolved that the Republican Convention should not be permitted\r\nto meet. The ground they urged for this proposed action was that the\r\nConvention proposed to recommend the imposition of Negro suffrage upon\r\nthe State. There was a riot and a terrible massacre, in which over a\r\nhundred lives were lost, and several hundred persons were wounded. The\r\nmunicipal authorities of New Orleans gave aid and comfort to the\r\nrioters.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee that investigated the circumstances\r\nconnected with the riot reported that the President knew that riot and\r\nbloodshed were apprehended. He knew what military orders were in force,\r\nand yet without the confirmation of the Secretary of War, or the General\r\nof the Army, upon whose responsibility these military orders had been\r\nissued, he gave orders by telegraph, which, if enforced, as they would\r\nbe, would have compelled our soldiers to aid the rebels against the men\r\nin New Orleans who had remained loyal during the war, and sought to aid\r\nand support, by official sanction, the persons who designed to suppress,\r\nby arrest and criminal process under color of the law, the meeting of\r\nthe Convention; and all this although the Convention was called with the\r\nsanction of the Governor and by one of the judges of the Supreme Court\r\nof Louisiana claiming to act as President of the Convention. The effect\r\nof the action of the President was to encourage the heart, to strengthen\r\nthe hand, and to hold up the arms of those who intended to prevent the\r\nConvention from assembling.\r\n\r\nThe President’s opposition to the Reconstruction Bill probably rendered\r\nhim more unpopular than any other executive act during his\r\nadministration. The bill was passed by large majorities in both Houses\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe President’s repudiation scheme was another very unpopular\r\nrecommendation, for which he was very strongly reproved by the action of\r\nCongress. He stated in his message of December, 1868: “That the holders\r\nof our securities have already received upon their bonds a larger amount\r\nthan their original investments, measured by the gold standard. Upon\r\nthis statement of facts, it would seem but just and equitable that the\r\nsix per cent. interest now paid by the Government should be applied to\r\nthe reduction of the principal, in semi-annual instalments, which in\r\nsixteen years and eight months would liquidate the entire national\r\ndebt.”\r\n\r\nThis clause of the President’s message was condemned by an almost\r\nunanimous vote of both Houses.\r\n\r\nThe great event in President Johnson’s career, however, was his\r\nimpeachment trial, which lasted from March 5 until May 26, 1868. He was\r\narraigned at the bar of the Senate, which was presided over by the Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, the Hon. Salmon P. Chase.\r\n\r\nThe counsel of the President were Attorney-General Henry Stanberry, who\r\nresigned his position to defend the President, ex-Judge Benjamin R.\r\nCurtis, William S. Groesbeck, who acted as substitute for Judge “Jerry”\r\nBlack, and Hon. Wm. M. Evarts. General Benjamin F. Butler made the\r\nopening argument against the President, accusing him of high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors. Hon. Wm. Lawrence, of Ohio, posted him on the law of\r\nimpeachment. The chief charge in the articles of impeachment was the\r\nremoval of Mr. Stanton from the office of Secretary of War, in alleged\r\nviolation of the Tenure-of-office Act. According to this act Stanton had\r\na right to hold office during the term of the President by whom he was\r\nappointed, and a month longer. He was appointed by President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe question to be decided then was whether Johnson was serving out\r\nLincoln’s unexpired term, or whether he was President _de facto_. Judge\r\nCurtis took the latter ground, and argued, therefore, that Stanton’s\r\nterm had expired.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the Senate was addressed against the\r\nPresident by General John A. Logan and Mr. Boutwell. Thaddeus Stevens\r\nattempted to read a speech, but was too weak. He handed his manuscript\r\nto General Butler, who read it to the Senate, but it fell comparatively\r\nflat. The Hon. Thomas Williams, of Pennsylvania, read a speech in favor\r\nof impeachment, which was well received. The case on behalf of the\r\nSenate was summed up by Hon. John A. Bingham, who arrayed all the\r\ncharges against the President in a very strong and unfavorable light.\r\nHis concluding sentences were, “I ask you, Senators, how long men would\r\ndeliberate upon the question whether a private citizen arraigned at the\r\nbar of one of your private tribunals of justice, for criminal violation\r\nof law, should be permitted to interpose a plea in justification of his\r\ncriminal act that his only purpose was to interpret the Constitution and\r\nlaws for himself; that he violated the law in the exercise of his\r\nprerogative to test it hereafter, at such day as might suit his own\r\nconvenience, in the courts of justice? Surely, Senators, it is as\r\ncompetent for the private citizen to interpose such justification in\r\nanswer to his crime as it is for the President of the United States to\r\ninterpose it, and for the simple reason that the Constitution is no\r\nrespecter of persons, and vests neither in the President nor in the\r\nprivate citizen judicial power. For the Senate to sustain any such plea\r\nwould, in my judgment, be a gross violation of the already violated\r\nconstitution and laws of a free people.”\r\n\r\nThe speech of “Our own Evarts” was the _chef d’œuvre_ of his life, and\r\nprobably did much to help the President’s narrow escape. As it was, he\r\nwas only saved from impeachment by one vote, namely, that of Mr. Ross,\r\nof Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n              THE DIX CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE WAR DEMOCRAT, GENERAL DIX, WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR BY THE\r\n    REPUBLICAN PARTY.—THE CANDIDATES OF SENATOR CONKLING REJECTED.—HOW\r\n    DIX WAS SPRUNG ON THE CONVENTION, TO THE CONSTERNATION OF THE\r\n    CAUCUS.—JUDGE ROBERTSON’S DISAPPOINTMENT.—EXCITING SCENES IN THE\r\n    CONVENTION.—GENERAL DIX DECLINES THE NOMINATION, BUT RECONSIDERS AND\r\n    ACCEPTS ON THE ADVICE OF HIS WIFE AND GENERAL GRANT.—HOW DIX’S\r\n    ELECTION ENSURED GRANT’S SECOND TERM AS PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the political events of the last quarter of a century in which I\r\ntook an active part, in common with some other Wall Street men, I think\r\nthe Utica Convention, at which General Dix was nominated for Governor of\r\nthis State, is entitled to special notice, particularly on account of\r\nits effect upon national politics.\r\n\r\nI was a delegate to that Convention. Just as I was stepping from the\r\ntrain to the platform at Utica I was met by a gentleman who introduced\r\nhimself to me as the Private Secretary of Senator Conkling. He said he\r\ncame to convey an invitation to me from the Senator to be his guest\r\nduring my stay in that city. He escorted me to the carriage in waiting,\r\nand I was taken to the palatial mansion of the Senator. I was the only\r\nresident guest during my stay—an honor which I highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen were invited that evening to dinner, amongst whom were\r\nHon. Chester A. Arthur, A. B. Cornell, Wm. Orton and General Sharpe.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of a sumptuous repast the subject matter relating to\r\nthe Convention was introduced by Senator Conkling. The Senator turned to\r\nme and said: “Mr. Clews, why would not George Opdyke be the best man for\r\nGovernor?” Mr. Opdyke and Senator Conkling had always been on excellent\r\nterms, and a few weeks previously this aspirant for Gubernatorial honors\r\nhad been a guest at the house of the Senator, and General Grant had been\r\nthere at the same time. It was apparent, therefore, that Mr. Opdyke had\r\ngained special recognition from the Senator as his candidate for\r\nGovernor, and that the choice had been sanctioned by General Grant. So\r\nthe visit of these two distinguished guests seemed to indicate that the\r\nmatter had been virtually, harmoniously and finally arranged, simply\r\nawaiting the official approval of the Convention. Hence, the point of\r\nthe Senator’s inquiry directed to myself.\r\n\r\nI replied: “Senator, I have a very high regard for Mr. Opdyke, as a man\r\nof great ability, as well as a brother banker, but as we have, all of\r\nus, a greater interest in what is to be done at this Convention, with a\r\nview of re-electing General Grant, we must, in my judgment, sacrifice\r\nall other interests thereto. Looking at the matter from that point of\r\nview, I am bound to say, therefore, that George Opdyke is not our best\r\nman. As you remember, he was Mayor of the city of New York at the time\r\nof the great riots of 1863, which was the most critical period of the\r\ncountry’s existence, and it was generally understood that in his\r\nofficial capacity he showed the white feather. While I admit that the\r\nexcitement at the time was calculated to intimidate some of the\r\nstrongest hearts, still, Mr. Opdyke, as Chief Magistrate of the city,\r\nwas supposed to be equal to the emergency, and to meet it with firmness,\r\nirrespective of personal danger. He was expected to be equal to the task\r\nof ordinary self sacrifice in such a position, and he did not come up to\r\npopular expectation.\r\n\r\n“And you will recollect, Senator,” I continued, “that your own\r\nbrother-in-law, that able, worthy and popular man, Hon. Horatio Seymour,\r\nwas so far carried away by his predilections then, that he addressed the\r\ncrowd of peace-breakers as ‘friends.’ I confess that when a man like him\r\nwas so pronounced on that side it was a difficult matter for a Mayor to\r\nhave backbone enough to withstand the pressure. But public opinion is\r\nnot in the habit of making such fine distinctions to excuse want of\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n“If this is not an ample reason,” I said, “I can give you another, which\r\nshould be sufficient to determine that Mr. Opdyke is not our best man at\r\nthis time. He is young enough, however, and may be available at a future\r\nperiod, when the asperities associated with these troublous times have\r\nbeen fully smoothed down. During the war Mr. Opdyke had the misfortune\r\nto be a special partner in a clothing manufacturing firm which had\r\nreceived a contract from the Government to make clothing for the poor\r\nfellows who were fighting our battles for the salvation of the country.\r\nThe clothing made by this firm was rejected on account of the\r\ninferiority of the material, and this is said to have been the first\r\napplication of the term ‘shoddy’ to army clothing in this country.”\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling seemed to be amazed at my statement, and admitted that his\r\nprotegé would not do. He felt considerably embarrassed in regard to his\r\nposition with reference to Mr. Opdyke. He said, “Mr. Opdyke is here and\r\nexpects the nomination. Some one ought to tell him to withdraw.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. A. B. Cornell volunteered to undertake this delicate duty.\r\nHe promptly performed it, and afterwards reported that the work had been\r\naccomplished. He said that Mr. Opdyke at once consented to comply with\r\nthe modest request, but was so mad about it that he had left the city by\r\nthe first train for home, being unwilling to remain for the convention.\r\n\r\nPrior to his departure, however, he had advised the Hon. W. H.\r\nRobertson, who was the next prominent candidate, of his withdrawal, and\r\nof the support of his constituency so far as his name could control it.\r\n\r\nMr. Robertson, who had been prominent in the preliminary canvass, was\r\ngratified at this turn of affairs, and encouraged by his new accession\r\nof strength. He was quick to embrace the opportunity now left open, as\r\nthere were no other candidates whom he feared. So the whole of that\r\nnight he worked arduously and faithfully for the object in view.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the Conkling mansion next morning, after breakfast, I\r\nmingled freely with the delegates, and found, from the efforts made the\r\nprevious night, that the nomination of Judge Robertson was a foregone\r\nconclusion, and the candidate himself was sure of it. The Robertson boom\r\nhad become suddenly popular. In fact, it was in the air.\r\n\r\nI was invited to General Arthur’s parlors, where the caucus had its\r\nheadquarters. It was customary with General Arthur, in those days, to\r\ntake parlors for that purpose at State Conventions. I found the rooms\r\nfilled with distinguished members of the party, and it was assumed by\r\nall that Robertson was the candidate for Governor; it was also proposed\r\nthat we should march in a body to his hotel, to congratulate him, and to\r\nassure him of the fact that we were all for him. I declined to be of the\r\nnumber on that mission, to the great chagrin of some of my friends. When\r\nasked for my reasons, I said that I had no feeling of personal hostility\r\ntowards Mr. Robertson, but as the New York _Times_ had not been pleased\r\nwith his conduct while State Senator, and had severely criticized him\r\nthereafter, I felt satisfied that under no circumstances could we rely\r\nupon the _Times_ to support our ticket if he were at the head of it; and\r\nas that was the only paper in New York that we had to fight our battles\r\nthen, it was all important that we should nominate a ticket that would\r\nnot be antagonistic to it, in order that we might have its endorsement\r\nand full co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the gentlemen went to pay their respects to Judge Robertson,\r\nas pre-arranged, and during their absence I went to the telegraph office\r\nand sent the following message to General John A. Dix, to his residence\r\nat 3 West Twenty-first street, New York:\r\n\r\n    You are favored by many of the delegates for Governor. If\r\n    nominated will you accept? For the sake of the country, answer\r\n    in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n                                                      “HENRY CLEWS.”\r\n\r\nTo this I received the following:\r\n\r\n    “I have telegraphed your dispatch to West Hampton, where my\r\n    father now is.\r\n\r\n    “Aug. 21 1872.\r\n\r\n                                                      “JOHN W. DIX.”\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards the Convention met, and the name of Robertson\r\nwas presented. The management had been so ably conducted since the\r\ndeparture of Mr. Opdyke, that there seemed to be an overwhelming hurrah\r\nin favor of Robertson, though it was evident that many of the delegates\r\ndid not know why they cheered, except by force of imitation. The\r\nConvention at first, as has been the case on many similar\r\noccasions—except that there never was any occasion precisely similar to\r\nthis one—did not seem to know its own mind, and was apparently well in\r\nhand by the management. Several most laudatory speeches were made in\r\nfavor of Robertson, which placed him on the very pinnacle of popularity\r\nwith the Convention, as manifested by the cheering and wild hurrahs with\r\nwhich the speeches were received. The management was thoroughly\r\nconvinced that the popular tide had begun to flow in favor of their\r\ncandidate, beyond the possibility of ebbing until it carried him to\r\nport, and there was probably no man in that enthusiastic audience more\r\nfully convinced of the fact than Robertson himself.\r\n\r\nSeveral other nominations were made, but that of Robertson overshadowed\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nWhen the gavel was about to descend on the choice of the people, as\r\nexpressed through their intelligent representatives by every sign of\r\nenthusiastic approval, the audience being almost exhausted with this\r\nhigh pressure of excitement, and when it was just prepared to relapse\r\ninto a more thoughtful and deliberate mood, I sprung General Dix on the\r\nConvention. The mere mention of the name of that veteran seemed to\r\ninspire the vast assemblage with new life. The announcement acted like\r\nmagic, and appeared to throw all the previous work of the Convention\r\ninto utter oblivion.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Bruce and the Hon. E. Delafield Smith had spoken, I said: “On\r\nbehalf of the bankers and business men of New York, regardless of party,\r\nthe nomination of John A. Dix would do more for the Republican party in\r\nthe national contest than any other that could be named. No other man\r\nwould receive equal confidence of the great monied interests of the\r\nmetropolis.”\r\n\r\nThe scene that followed the remarks of these gentlemen and myself is\r\nindescribable. The whole audience arose to their feet and cheered\r\nvehemently. If the house had been struck with lightning the caucus\r\nmanagers could not have been more surprised, and Judge Robertson must\r\nhave begun to doubt his own identity.\r\n\r\nConcerning the scene in the Convention at this juncture, the New York\r\n_Herald_ the next morning had the following:\r\n\r\n    “The enthusiasm excited by the representatives of Henry Clews\r\n    carried the Convention, and it only wanted to put the question\r\n    to the delegates to result in a triumph for the Dix interest.\r\n    There was great confusion in the hall at this moment. Delegates\r\n    attempted to make themselves heard from all parts of the hall.\r\n    There were heard the first notes of the coming avalanche of\r\n    victory for the Dix ticket. The stentorian voice of a delegate\r\n    from St. Lawrence, mighty almost as the cataract of Niagara, was\r\n    heard above the din, proclaiming that the St. Lawrence\r\n    delegation endorsed the nomination of Dix. Further enthusiasm\r\n    was thus excited. Then followed Kings, Jefferson, Cayuga and\r\n    others, lost in the cheering that was incessantly kept up. The\r\n    whole of the delegation seemed under one impulse to fall into\r\n    line under the flag raised by Dix as the standard-bearer of the\r\n    party. Then came a demand that no ballot should be taken,\r\n    formally or informally, but that the nomination of General Dix\r\n    be made by acclamation. The Hon. William A. Wheeler, the\r\n    chairman, said such a motion was not in order, as there were\r\n    other candidates before the Convention. This difficulty, like\r\n    every other, was soon swept away in the tornado of excitement\r\n    consequent upon the sudden and unexpected course of affairs, so\r\n    lately garbled and mixed up, had taken; and the clear course\r\n    that the name of one man, held back to the lucky moment, had\r\n    arrived, to give it a talismanic power, opened to the previous\r\n    bewildered senses of the delegates when the Bald-Eagle of\r\n    Westchester, the proposer of Judge Robertson, arose and\r\n    announced the withdrawal of his nominee’s name. A thunder of\r\n    applause followed this announcement, which was echoed and\r\n    re-echoed, when the several other proposers withdrew in quick\r\n    succession the names of their candidates. Then came again the\r\n    call to put the name of General Dix by acclamation to the\r\n    Convention. The vote was put and was unanimously carried, with\r\n    the greatest excitement ever before witnessed at a Convention.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Times_ said editorially:\r\n\r\n    “The Convention of this State has placed at the head of its\r\n    ticket two of the strongest names it could possibly have\r\n    selected. In General Dix it has nominated a Democrat who is free\r\n    from all the reproaches which the last twelve years have brought\r\n    upon the Democratic party—a man whose character is without a\r\n    stain, whose strenuous efforts to assist the Union during the\r\n    rebellion ought never to be forgotten, who has been one of our\r\n    most indefatigable assistants in the work of reform, and whose\r\n    integrity and abilities alike entitle him to the respect of the\r\n    public. No one can doubt that if we have General Dix as Governor\r\n    of this State the affairs of the community will be managed with\r\n    discretion, dignity and a high sense of honor. We purposely\r\n    refrained from recommending candidates to the Convention, but\r\n    now that all is over, we need not disguise our opinion that\r\n    General Dix was the very best man that could have been chosen.\r\n    Honest Democrats will gladly support him, Republicans have every\r\n    reason to arrange themselves by his side, for he has identified\r\n    himself with every great work in which they have been\r\n    interested. He has always done his duty, no matter what position\r\n    he has occupied, and we shall be proud to assist in electing him\r\n    as Governor of this State. If we could not trust such a man as\r\n    General Dix, it would be very hard to carry on the work of\r\n    popular government at all.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the proceedings I sent the following despatch to General\r\nDix:\r\n\r\n    “I took the responsibility of putting your name forward as a\r\n    candidate for Governor, and now rejoice in apprising you of your\r\n    nomination by the Convention by acclamation.\r\n\r\n                                                      “HENRY CLEWS.”\r\n\r\nOn my return to New York, to my utter dismay, I found the following\r\ntelegram awaiting me:\r\n\r\n                                       “WEST HAMPTON, Aug. 22, 1872.\r\n\r\n    “HENRY CLEWS:\r\n\r\n    “I have been compelled to decline.\r\n\r\n                                                      “JOHN A. DIX.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I went down to Long Branch to see General Grant, and\r\nspent the evening with him. I showed him the despatch from General Dix,\r\ndeclining the nomination, and expressed the opinion that it was all\r\nimportant that he should be prevailed upon to reconsider his first\r\nresolve, and permit his name to head our ticket. “You know, General,” I\r\nsaid, “Dix is a war Democrat. He will act as a bridge to bring over to\r\nour ranks all the war Democrats. It was chiefly for that reason that I\r\nsprung him on the Convention.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant realized the position at once, and fully agreed with me.\r\n\r\nI said: “General, you must write a letter to General Dix, urging him to\r\naccept the nomination.” He wrote to General Dix in a day or two. The\r\nveteran was greatly moved by a letter from a renowned brother in arms,\r\nbut still had some difficulty in making up his mind, lest he might lay\r\nhimself open to the charge of inconsistency. And here comes in the\r\npredominating influence of lovely woman, even cruelly deprived as she is\r\nof the ballot. General Dix held his final answer in abeyance until he\r\nshould consult his wife.\r\n\r\n                     GENERAL GRANT TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the letter which General Grant wrote after my interview\r\nwith him:\r\n\r\n                                 “LONG BRANCH, N. J., Aug. 24, 1872.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR GENERAL:\r\n\r\n    “I congratulate you upon the unanimity and enthusiasm of the\r\n    Utica Convention on the occasion of your nomination for the\r\n    honorable and responsible position of Governor of the great\r\n    State of New York. Especially do I congratulate the citizens of\r\n    that State, almost irrespective of party, upon your nomination.\r\n    I believe you will receive the active support of the great\r\n    majority of the best people of the State, and the secret\r\n    sympathy of thousands who may be so bound up by party ties and\r\n    pledges as to force them to support your opponent.\r\n\r\n    “But to doubt your election would be to impugn the intelligence\r\n    and patriotism of a people by whose enlightened discrimination\r\n    such good men as Tompkins, Clinton, Marcy, Fish, King and Morgan\r\n    have been lifted to the Chief Magistracy of the Empire State.\r\n    With your election reforms in the State will naturally follow,\r\n    which all acknowledge have been much needed for years.\r\n\r\n    “No one acquainted with the political history of New York for\r\n    the past eight years will claim that all the abuses of\r\n    legislation are due to Democratic rule, but members, or at least\r\n    pretended members, of both political parties share the\r\n    responsibility of them.\r\n\r\n    “When I read the proceedings of the Convention of the 21st\r\n    inst., and of the unanimity of feeling in favor of you and your\r\n    associates on the State ticket, I felt that victory had been\r\n    already achieved and reform inaugurated in the State of New\r\n    York.\r\n\r\n    “Again, I congratulate you, not upon the prospect of being\r\n    Governor, but upon having it within your reach to render such\r\n    services to your State.\r\n\r\n    “It is a happy day when conventions seek candidates, not\r\n    candidates nominations. This dream has been realized in the\r\n    action of the Convention of the 21st inst. at Utica, New York.\r\n\r\n    “I have the honor to be, General, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       U. S. GRANT.”\r\n\r\n    “GEN. JOHN A. DIX, N. Y.”\r\n\r\n                          GENERAL DIX’S REPLY.\r\n\r\n                                  “LEAFIELD, WEST HAMPTON, N. Y.,\r\n\r\n                                       August 28, 1872.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR GENERAL:\r\n\r\n    “I am very thankful to you for your kind letter of\r\n    congratulation on my nomination for the office of Governor of\r\n    this State. You are aware, no doubt, that I declined it before\r\n    the Convention was held. I am deeply sensible of the honor\r\n    conferred on me, especially by the manner in which it was\r\n    tendered; but my objections to the acceptance of the nomination\r\n    are so strong, that I would not think of it a moment, were it\r\n    not for the deep concern I feel in the result of the election,\r\n    and the great public interests at stake.\r\n\r\n    “I expect Mrs. Dix to arrive from Europe on the 2nd or 3rd\r\n    proximo, and as soon as I am able to confer with her, I shall\r\n    reply to the letter of the President of the Convention, advising\r\n    me of my nomination.\r\n\r\n    “I am, dear General, very respectfully and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                       JOHN A. DIX.”\r\n\r\n    “HIS EXCELLENCY, U. S. GRANT.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this correspondence that General Grant’s letter,\r\nwhich I take the credit of having inspired, reinforced by the latent,\r\nloving power and good judgment of Mrs. Dix, assisted in the wise\r\ndecision of the war Democrat to accept the Republican office which was\r\njudiciously thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nThe election of Dix made the second calling and election of Grant sure.\r\nThe Republican party took General Dix into its fold, and the effect was,\r\nas I had anticipated, to bring thousands of others similarly situated,\r\nto vote, at the Presidential election, for General Grant.\r\n\r\nThe Dix nomination was the worst black eye that Mr. Greeley received\r\nduring that campaign, and the Sage of Chappaqua acknowledged on his\r\ndeath bed that that event, together with the Grant mass meetings at the\r\nCooper Institute, described in another chapter, sealed his political\r\ndoom.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n CONSEQUENCES OF THE UTICA (DIX’S) CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF SECRET HISTORY.—CONKLING GETS THE CREDIT FOR DIX’S\r\n    NOMINATION AND HIS “SILENCE GIVES CONSENT” TO THE HONOR.—ROBERTSON\r\n    REGARDS HIM AS A MARPLOT.—THE SENATOR INNOCENTLY CONDEMNED.—THE\r\n    MISUNDERSTANDING WHICH DEFEATED GRANT FOR THE THIRD TERM, AND\r\n    ELECTED GARFIELD.—HOW THE NOBLE “306” WERE DISCOMFITED.-“ANYTHING TO\r\n    BEAT GRANT.”—THE STALWARTS AND THE HALF BREEDS.-“ME TOO.”—THE\r\n    EXCITEMENT WHICH AROUSED GUITEAU’S MURDEROUS SPIRIT TO KILL\r\n    GARFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political events succeeding the Utica Convention and the nomination\r\nof General Dix for Governor contain some inside history of more than\r\nordinary importance.\r\n\r\nHad I not sprung General Dix on that Convention at the peculiar moment,\r\nas described in the last chapter, Judge Robertson would have carried the\r\nday with flying colors. It was a sudden and crushing blow to the\r\nprospects of himself and his political friends, and it dissipated some\r\nof the brightest hopes and brilliant schemes that had ever originated in\r\nthe fertile brain of Senator Conkling. As a consequence of the unique\r\nturn that affairs took on that day, the Senator was placed in a false\r\nposition in relation to some of his best friends. Several of the latter\r\nwere put in an attitude whereby they misinterpreted the actions of\r\nSenator Conkling at that Convention, and unjustly accused him of\r\nbetraying friends that he had promised to support. This was the result\r\nof a misconception on their part, that the Senator was the prime mover\r\nof the _coup d’etat_ that surprised the Convention in the nomination of\r\nGeneral Dix.\r\n\r\nThe credit was awarded to Conkling, without any hesitation or inquiry,\r\nand he was either too proud, or too indifferent to public opinion to\r\nexplain. If he had explained his position candidly the chances are that\r\nhis explanation would have been taken in a Pickwickian or political\r\nsense. In fact, he was in a position where he could hardly escape the\r\nresponsibility of Dix’s nomination, and everybody was ready to believe\r\nthat the movement in favor of Dix was too good a thing to be engineered\r\nby a man of less calibre.\r\n\r\nIt would have been useless, therefore, for anybody else to explain, as\r\nthe person attempting to do so would only have been laughed to scorn.\r\n\r\nJudge Robertson, himself the greatest sufferer by the curious turn\r\naffairs had taken, was the first to believe that the nomination of Dix\r\nwas one of Conkling’s masterstrokes of political policy. He never\r\nthought of looking to any other source for its emanation. He believed in\r\nhis soul it was the work of Conkling, and he thinks so to this day.\r\n\r\nI happened to have been better informed, however; but my explanation\r\nwould have hardly passed muster at that time, and I would have been\r\ncharged with egotism if I had attempted to explain. I think an\r\nexplanation is now in order, however, and may point a moral as well as\r\nhelp to adorn a tale.\r\n\r\nHistory is said to be philosophy teaching by example, and one great\r\nhistorian has said that no one event in itself is any more important\r\nthan another, except from what it teaches posterity by its example. So,\r\nfor the benefit of posterity, I now state the facts on this historical\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI am willing to make affidavit on the revised edition of the good book\r\nthat prior to the Utica Convention the name of General Dix was not even\r\nlisped by Senator Conkling within my hearing, nor was Dix ever thought\r\nof even remotely by the Senator as a possible candidate.\r\n\r\nI am almost certain that the Senator had taken no action that could\r\npossibly conflict with the interests of Judge Robertson prior to the\r\nmention of the name of Dix at the Convention. In fact, with the\r\nexceptions previously stated, I am quite certain that the name of Dix\r\nwas a genuine surprise to the entire Convention, managers and all.\r\n\r\nJudge Robertson thought differently, however. He believed that Conkling\r\nwas the cause of his defeat, and to this misapprehension is due the\r\nenmity that sprang up between these two men, and worked with various\r\nresults to the defeat of the political aims of both ever since.\r\n\r\nAs I was Senator Conkling’s guest, this seemed to create a conviction in\r\nthe mind of Judge Robertson, without any inquiry into the matter, that I\r\nhad acted at the instigation of Conkling in bringing Dix to the front;\r\nwhereas the conception of Dix as the best candidate originated solely\r\nwith myself, nor did I ever suggest the idea to Conkling until I\r\naddressed the Convention, in favor of General Dix.\r\n\r\nBelieving as he did, that the Senator had played the marplot to such\r\nperfection at Utica, Robertson was naturally on the watch for the first\r\nopportunity that would enable him to get even with the friend whom he\r\nsuspected of having so basely betrayed him, and with having blocked his\r\nway to political preferment.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity came at the Chicago Convention, when the Utica\r\nstatesman was managing matters very successfully to nominate General\r\nGrant for a third term.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the very circumstance which was most conducive to\r\nGrant’s success for the second term was the remote cause of his defeat\r\nfor the third. Senator Conkling had no idea of the deep-seated enmity\r\nthat lodged in the breast of Robertson. He had done nothing, knowingly,\r\nto merit it, and had been calculating on the co-operation of Robertson,\r\nas usual. He was not aware of the smouldering fire of vengeance that lay\r\nlatent in the bosom of his friend. He supposed that Robertson and his\r\nco-mates in politics were with him as in days of yore in the support of\r\nGeneral Grant. He imagined that he had gone to Chicago with a full hand,\r\nbut instead of that he was short of some of his best cards, and his\r\nenemies had them stocked in a way that finally brought him to grief.\r\n\r\nConkling only discovered his dilemma after the Convention met, when he\r\nfound to his dismay that Robertson had bolted the Grant ticket.\r\n\r\nRobertson had first made an alliance with the Blaine party, but finding\r\nan insufficiency of power among that party to carry his point against\r\nthe solid phalanx of the Grant movement, he joined forces with John\r\nSherman’s supporters, who were under the management of James A.\r\nGarfield.\r\n\r\nThe able strategist from Utica, at the head of his 306 chosen followers,\r\nso disconcerted the Sherman contingent that it also failed to carry the\r\nnecessary number of guns.\r\n\r\nAs day after day passed without any change, it seemed as if the Conkling\r\nforces had adopted the motto of Napoleon’s old guard, “The Guard dies,\r\nbut does not surrender.”\r\n\r\nAt length Robertson and his lieutenants collected the shattered ranks of\r\nBlaine and Sherman, and with Garfield at their head, like Ney attacking\r\nthe English centre at Waterloo, hurled them with desperation on the\r\nsolid square of Conkling, which still remained unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe united forces, however, with the war cry, “Anything to beat Grant!”\r\ncarried the day, Garfield was nominated and Conkling retired in good\r\norder, but greatly discomfited.\r\n\r\nRobertson had taken up this cry at the Convention in the same spirit\r\nthat was displayed by another man about whom a good story was told\r\nduring that campaign. He had got that shibboleth on the brain, “Anything\r\nto beat Grant!” As the story goes, a prediction had been made by some\r\nreligious enthusiast that the world was coming to an end early in\r\nNovember of that year. A preacher was reminding his congregation, one\r\nSunday, of the prediction, and the possibility of its fulfilment—at\r\nleast that it was well to be prepared for such an event. At the\r\nconclusion of his exhortation, a man in the congregation arose to his\r\nfeet, and in a solemnly pathetic voice said, “Thank God.” At the end of\r\nthe service the minister’s curiosity was excited to converse with the\r\nman who had so fervently thanked heaven for what most people regarded as\r\na universal calamity. He saw the man, and asked why he had made such a\r\nremarkable ejaculation at the prospect of such a terrible consummation.\r\n“Anything to beat Grant,” was the reckless and self-sacrificing\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit that the Robertson party made the fight at\r\nChicago, and in this spirit that they triumphed. It was anything to beat\r\nSenator Conkling, however, so far as Judge Robertson was concerned, who\r\non other grounds would probably have preferred Grant. Thus he avenged\r\nupon the wrong man his defeat at the Utica Convention, and I was\r\npermitted to escape scathless, though innocently responsible for\r\nblasting his Gubernatorial aspirations.\r\n\r\nThis was not the end of Judge Robertson’s enmity to Senator Conkling,\r\nhowever. When the new Government came into power, Garfield, in making up\r\nhis cabinet, selected Blaine as a member of that special body. This\r\ncreated a bad feeling between Blaine and Conkling, as it seemed to the\r\nlatter like a continuation of the conspiracy between Robertson and\r\nBlaine, hatched at the Chicago Convention. Thus the seeds of a strong\r\nand bitter antagonism were sown between these two leading spirits in the\r\nRepublican party, each aspiring to be at least the power behind the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nAfter Garfield’s inauguration Blaine was made Secretary of State. Great\r\ncredit for the Presidential success was not only due to Mr. Blaine, but\r\nin a large degree to Judge Robertson also, as without his assistance\r\nGarfield could not have been nominated. So it was necessary to take care\r\nof Judge Robertson too. This was done by making him Collector of the\r\nPort of New York. These appointments were severe political blows, which,\r\nin the nature of circumstances, fell with full force upon the devoted\r\nhead of Senator Conkling.\r\n\r\nThese events led to the sudden resignation of Senator Conkling and\r\nSenator Platt, “Me Too,” and a very serious division in the ranks of the\r\nparty, under the respective names and banners of the Stalwarts and the\r\nHalf-Breeds.\r\n\r\nThe excitement growing out of the political battle between these\r\nfactions aroused the intemperate zeal and insane delusions of Guiteau to\r\nkill the President. Thus the thread of cause and effect, when followed\r\nup in this way, is entangled in the deepest mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n             GRANT’S SECOND TERM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST MAN FOR THE POSITION AND MOST DESERVING OF THE HONOR.—HOW THE\r\n    “BOOM” WAS WORKED UP IN FAVOR OF GRANT.—THE GREAT FINANCIERS AND\r\n    SPECULATORS ALL COME TO THE FRONT IN THE INTEREST OF THE NATION’S\r\n    PROSPERITY AND OF THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED THE COUNTRY.—THE GREAT MASS\r\n    MEETING AT COOPER UNION.—WHY A. T. STEWART REFUSED TO PRESIDE.—THE\r\n    RESULTS OF THE MASS MEETING AND HOW THEY WERE APPRECIATED BY THE\r\n    FRIENDS OF THE CANDIDATE, LEADING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS\r\n    COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC PRESS GENERALLY, IRRESPECTIVE OF PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to relate briefly the part which I took in the re-election of\r\nGeneral Grant, whose defeat, when he was spoken of as a candidate for\r\nthe second term, was foreshadowed among a large number of politicians of\r\nevery stripe. There were serious divisions in the ranks of his former\r\nfriends and adherents, and an organized effort was made to destroy his\r\nprospects a long time in advance of the meeting of the Philadelphia\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nAll the political machinery of his enemies, and of disappointed office\r\nseekers and their friends, was put in force, and all the tactics and\r\nprejudices employed that were put into operation with greater success\r\nfour years later.\r\n\r\nI felt assured that the nomination of any other man might result in the\r\ndefeat of the party, and that it was absolutely necessary to its\r\nstrength, maintenance and autonomy that General Grant should again be\r\nour choice. He had been tried for one term and found to be a very\r\nsatisfactory executive. There was no important risk involved in trying\r\nhim for a second term while the experiment with another man in the then\r\nsensitive, unsettled and tentative condition of reconstruction, might\r\nhave been injurious to the best political and industrial interests of\r\nthe country; and the experiment would have been especially risky if the\r\nnominee should have been a Democrat.\r\n\r\nThe people of the South were not then in a proper frame of mind to be\r\ntrusted with any power implying the mere possibility of obtaining a\r\ncontrolling influence in the affairs of the Government. I perceived it\r\nwas important that the Republicans should make a nomination that had a\r\nfair prospect of being successful, and I felt satisfied that the result\r\nwould be extremely doubtful if we should nominate any other man.\r\n\r\nBesides, no other man was more deserving of the national compliment,\r\nconsidering that he had done so much to terminate the struggle for\r\nnational existence, and had been the chief force in suppressing the\r\nRebellion. His genius and courage had been chiefly instrumental in\r\npreserving to the country the blessing of a Republican form of\r\nGovernment. For this boon no people could ever be too profuse in the\r\nmanifestations of their gratitude.\r\n\r\nThis was the patriotic feeling deep in the hearts of the people at\r\nlarge, but there was a secret movement engineered by “sore-head”\r\npoliticians, behind whom were even more dangerous enemies, to thwart\r\npatriotic purposes. Some of these conspirators had been brooding over\r\nlatent schemes of anarchy for a long period, and had been attempting to\r\nput them in organic shape before half the first term of General Grant\r\nhad expired. They were hard at work training public opinion, by every\r\nmeans in their power, to prevent Grant’s renomination.\r\n\r\nThis hostile element was sedulously hatching scandals and ventilating\r\nthem in subsidized newspapers, and through various other disreputable\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThis opposition increased in violence and intensity, and as the time\r\napproached when the country was to choose its next President, the\r\nrenomination of General Grant became a matter of serious doubt, even to\r\nsome of his most enthusiastic supporters. It had become a foregone\r\nconclusion that the Democrats would draw largely from the Republican\r\nranks, and the anxiety on this point was intensified by the hostility of\r\nthe _Tribune_, and the prospect of Horace Greeley’s candidacy. It was\r\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, that an energetic effort should be\r\nmade, and the requisite steps taken to ensure General Grant’s success at\r\nthe Convention.\r\n\r\nI entered into this feeling with a great deal of personal enthusiasm.\r\nWhat was my motive? some one reading this may ask.\r\n\r\nBecause I believed the sacredness of contracts, the stability of wealth,\r\nthe success of business enterprise, and the prosperity of the whole\r\ncountry depended on the election of Grant for President.\r\n\r\nIf the reader wants to get at the selfish motive, as all readers do, I\r\nshall be perfectly candid with him in that respect also. Of course I\r\nknew that Wall Street business would boom in the wake of this general\r\nprosperity. That was the selfish motive, from which no man is free. Of\r\ncourse, I expected to share in Wall Street’s consequent prosperity.\r\n\r\nI did not want office, as several of the highest were offered me which I\r\nrespectfully declined; and no office in the gift of the people would\r\nhave compensated me financially; and moreover, my highest ambition has\r\nbeen satisfied in my own line of business.\r\n\r\nI went to work then in the interest of Grant for the second term. I\r\nemployed numerous canvassers at my own expense, to find out the minds of\r\nthe representative business men on the subject, and to talk the matter\r\nup with those interested in Republican success. These men reported to me\r\ndaily, and in a short time I had sounded the minds of that part of the\r\nbusiness community who had the greatest stake in the country, and whose\r\ninfluence is always most felt when any important achievement is to be\r\ncompassed. I sent out a petition, and obtained the names of a splendid\r\narray of merchants and business men of all shades of opinion and\r\npolitics in favor of Grant. Following is the heading of the petition:\r\n\r\n    “A PUBLIC MEETING.\r\n\r\n    “To the merchants, bankers, manufacturers and other business men\r\n    in favor of the re-election of General Grant:\r\n\r\n    “The undersigned, desiring publicly to express their earnest\r\n    confidence in the sagacity, fidelity, energy and unfaltering\r\n    patriotism, so signally displayed by Ulysses S. Grant in\r\n    securing the restoration of peace at home, upholding national\r\n    rights abroad, and in maintaining throughout the world the honor\r\n    of the American name, do hereby invite their fellow citizens to\r\n    assemble in mass meeting at the Cooper Institute, on Wednesday\r\n    evening, the 17th of April, 1872.”\r\n\r\nThis call was chiefly the result of the personal canvass which I had\r\ninstituted a few weeks previously. I selected the names of the persons\r\nto be called on from day to day, and kept these men working the matter\r\nup, until I had secured almost all the reputable business firms in the\r\ncity of New York. The following, whose original signatures I have still\r\nin my possession, were prominent in the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM E. DODGE,\r\n    JOHN C. GREEN,\r\n    HENRY F. VAIL,\r\n    GEORGE T. ADEE,\r\n    REV. SAMUEL OSGOOD,\r\n    WILLIAM H. FOGG,\r\n    BENJAMIN B. SHERMAN,\r\n    ROBERT L. STEWART,\r\n    WILLIAM HENRY ANTHON,\r\n    E. D. MORGAN,\r\n    JAMES BUELL,\r\n    H. B.

VANDERBILT,\r\n    SHEPARD KNAPP,\r\n    WM. H. ASPINWALL,\r\n    J. S. ROCKWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sad to reflect that these are all now numbered with the mighty\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThese names will serve to show the great number of prominent people\r\ngradually departing from us every few years.\r\n\r\nThe name of the number of those yet alive who signed that petition is\r\nlegion. In fact those who did not sign it were those whose names were\r\nnot worth having. To put it mildly, I secured through their own\r\nsignatures, by this method, all whose names were desirable. Our forces\r\nhaving been mustered in this way, the next thing was to disconcert the\r\nenemy, and inspire our own party by showing our available strength, and\r\nthe power and enthusiasm behind the movement. This we proceeded to do by\r\ncalling a mass meeting at the Cooper Institute for April 17, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was an immense success, in numbers, brains and\r\nrespectability. The hall was crowded and the outside meeting was several\r\ntimes larger.\r\n\r\nMr. A. T. Stewart had been invited to preside. He had been a warm friend\r\nof General Grant, but had then become lukewarm and indifferent, owing to\r\nthe fact that he had failed to obtain a Custom House promotion for one\r\nof his wife’s near relations. I had endeavored for several days to\r\nsoften Stewart’s heart and get him to consent to be chairman of the\r\nmeeting, but he was incorrigible. Finally, I succeeded in extorting a\r\npromise from him that if he did not vote for General Grant he would not\r\nvote against him, but beyond this it was impossible to mollify him. He\r\nwas a paragon of obduracy when he had once resolved upon any course.\r\nEven the recollection that he, though an alien born, had been offered\r\nthe second highest position of trust in the nation, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, which he could not accept on account of being in business,\r\nfailed to draw out his feelings of gratitude sufficiently to forget the\r\nfancied slight of refusing his wife’s relative promotion.\r\n\r\nFailing to secure Mr. Stewart, I invited Mr. William E. Dodge to\r\npreside. He graciously accepted the invitation and made a very good\r\nchairman indeed.\r\n\r\nThe array of Vice-Presidents was said to excel anything that had ever\r\nappeared in a similar list of the proceedings of any meeting in this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nI had invited Fred. Douglas and P. B. S. Pinchback, the eminent colored\r\norators, to the meeting, but they could not attend, as they were at a\r\nNew Orleans convention of their own people. Mr. Rainey, a colored\r\ngentleman, spoke most eloquently and with telling effect. This was the\r\nfirst time since the war that a colored orator had addressed a meeting\r\nof whites on politics in New York, or probably in the North. Prior to\r\nthis the colored vote for Grant had been in doubt, as Horace Greeley,\r\nwhose name was a word to conjure with among these people, had recently\r\nbeen swinging around the circle down South, with a view of capturing\r\nalike the vote of the colored people, who loved him, and that of the\r\nDemocrats, who hated him. By a curious fatality he failed to capture\r\neither. As Blaine has truly said of him: “No other candidate could have\r\npresented such an antithesis of strength and weakness.”\r\n\r\nThere had been no meeting for a long time previous to this that had been\r\nthe cause of such an enthusiastic awakening in the party and among\r\npoliticians generally over the whole country, as this great\r\ndemonstration of the people at the Cooper Union. It crushed the\r\naspirations of the so-called Independents and smothered the lingering\r\nhopes of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the influence of this mass meeting upon the destiny of\r\npolitical parties in the Presidential election of 1872, it will be\r\nnecessary to take a retrospect of the impression it made on parties most\r\ndeeply interested in the result, and to make known their private\r\nopinions on the subject. Inside history of this nature is always\r\ninstructive, and time has clothed with the attribute of public property,\r\nwhat at one time was a very precious political secret.\r\n\r\nAmong the striking incidents of the night of that meeting I distinctly\r\nrecollect one that was truly prophetic, in regard to Senator Henry\r\nWilson, of Massachusetts. A number of the speakers and other prominent\r\nmen took supper with me at the Union League Club after the meeting, and\r\nin proposing the health of Senator Wilson, who had spoken so eloquently,\r\nI nominated him for the Vice-Presidency, and sure enough he was\r\nafterwards elected to that position.\r\n\r\nI shall take the liberty in this place of introducing to the reader a\r\nfew letters hitherto unpublished, which throw considerable light on the\r\nvalue of the political work done by myself and friends at that time, and\r\nhow it was appreciated by those most deeply interested in its outcome.\r\n\r\nThe following from the White House shows how anxiously the current of\r\nevents was being watched from that great centre:\r\n\r\n                                “EXECUTIVE MANSION,                }\r\n                                 WASHINGTON, D. C., April 17, 1872 }\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR CLEWS:\r\n\r\n    I have received your several interesting letters in regard to\r\n    the great meeting in New York, and have shown them to the\r\n    President, who read them with deep interest. I have not\r\n    written any suggestions, because I know you, being on the\r\n    ground, could judge so much better of the situation, and the\r\n    temper of the New York people. You have done a great work, and\r\n    this evening’s success will, I have no doubt, be the reward of\r\n    your efforts. We shall look anxiously for the reports. What\r\n    you say is curious about the use of Dix’s name and others. Our\r\n    people are at work in Congress getting up telegrams signed by\r\n    the Republican members of all the State delegations endorsing\r\n    the administration of General Grant. I wish we had thought of\r\n    these sooner, but still we can get them all in time, I hope. I\r\n    have just come from the House, where I was looking after this\r\n    matter. Wishing you every success,\r\n\r\n                                  I remain yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                       HORACE PORTER,\r\n\r\n                                            (Sec’y to President\r\n    Grant.)\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting the President’s Secretary writes as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                EXECUTIVE MANSION, }\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, D.

We read the proceedings in full in\r\n    the _Times_ last night. It has created a marked effect in\r\n    Congress and elsewhere. Nearly every Republican in the House\r\n    would have signed the congratulatory telegrams, but the movement\r\n    was started so late in the day that the paper was not presented\r\n    to any one.\r\n\r\n                                  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                       HORACE PORTER.\r\n\r\nThe following, from the Hon. Roscoe Conkling, is a very flattering\r\nreminiscence, which I highly appreciate:\r\n\r\n                                     UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, }\r\n                                     WASHINGTON, April 19, 1872.   }\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    As a New Yorker and a Republican, I want to thank you for the\r\n    great service you have rendered our country and our cause in\r\n    conceiving and carrying forward the great meeting of night\r\n    before last.\r\n\r\n    The effect of it will be wholesome and widefelt; it was most\r\n    timely, and its whole management was a success. Our friends all,\r\n    I think, know and appreciate the large debt due you in the\r\n    premises.\r\n\r\n    Noting your suggestions as to the future, I lay them to heart.\r\n\r\n                                  Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n         ROSCOE CONKLING.\r\n\r\n    HENRY CLEWS, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Herald’s_ special from Washington next day after the\r\nmeeting said:\r\n\r\n    “The President, in conversation with Senators who called upon\r\n    him this morning, expressed himself as much pleased with the\r\n    demonstration in New York last night, which he regards only as\r\n    evidence of the popularity of the Republican party. He has been\r\n    assured, from reliable sources, that the leading Democratic\r\n    merchants and bankers in different parts of the country are\r\n    anxious that the Republican party may completely triumph at the\r\n    coming Presidential election, as the surest way of maintaining\r\n    our credit, and resisting anything like a financial crisis,\r\n    which they regard as certain if their own party should succeed.”\r\n\r\nFollowing are the address and resolutions expressed through the\r\nrepresentatives of a grateful people in favor of the hero who had saved\r\nthe country:\r\n\r\n    _Grant Meeting at Cooper Institute, March 17, 1872.—Address and\r\n    Resolutions._\r\n\r\n                                ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n    Hon. E. Delafield Smith, on behalf of the Committee of\r\n    Arrangements, read the following address, remarking that it was\r\n    prepared by one of the most eminent and substantial of our\r\n    business men:\r\n\r\n    The administration of public affairs under the government of\r\n    President Grant has been eminently wise, conservative and\r\n    patriotic; our foreign relations have been conducted with a\r\n    scrupulous respect for the rights of other nations, a jealous\r\n    regard for the honor of our own; the noble aspiration with which\r\n    General Grant emphasized his acceptance of his great office,\r\n    “Let us have peace,” has been happily realized; the Union has\r\n    been completely re-established on such principles of justice and\r\n    equity as to insure its perpetuity; the Constitution, with all\r\n    its amendments, has been adhered to with rigid fidelity;\r\n    domestic tranquility has been restored; a spirit of humanity has\r\n    been infused into our Indian policy; the revenues of the country\r\n    have been faithfully collected and honestly disbursed, so that,\r\n    while the burdens of taxation have been materially lightened,\r\n    the public debt has been largely reduced, and the national\r\n    credit appreciably strengthened; all branches of industry have\r\n    been stimulated to healthy activity; and throughout the length\r\n    and breadth of the land security, prosperity and happiness\r\n    reward the perils and sacrifices by which the rebellion was\r\n    suppressed and the Union preserved.\r\n\r\n    It is an act of poetic justice that the soldier whose victories\r\n    in war, and the statesman whose triumphs of peace have made the\r\n    last decade the most glorious in the annals of American history,\r\n    should receive an earnest of the gratitude of his countrymen by\r\n    his re-election to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n    It is an auspicious circumstance that the people are evidently\r\n    awakening to a higher sense of the duties and responsibilities\r\n    of public officials. There is a general disposition to hold men\r\n    entrusted with place and power to a strict accountability for\r\n    their acts, and to demand that honesty and capability shall be\r\n    the inflexible conditions of appointment to office. The\r\n    recommendations of the president in favor of the principles\r\n    enunciated in the report of the Civil Service Commission, were\r\n    timely and apposite, and deserve universal endorsement.\r\n\r\n    Numerous investigations have been set on foot during the present\r\n    session of Congress, having for their object the discovery of\r\n    corruption in the public service. Disaffected Republicans and\r\n    partisan Democrats have made common cause in the endeavor to\r\n    elicit evidence tending to show acts of wrong doing, and to\r\n    implicate the President in knowledge or toleration of such acts.\r\n    As in the days of Daniel, “they sought to find occasion against\r\n    him.” But, like the enemies of Daniel, “_they could find none\r\n    occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was\r\n    there any error or fault found with him_.”\r\n\r\n    The more incisive the scrutiny, the more palpable the\r\n    demonstration of his purity. The cost of pursuing these\r\n    investigations has exceeded the aggregate loss incurred by the\r\n    Government through the dishonesty of its subordinates since the\r\n    administration came into power.\r\n\r\n    A record so clear and honorable challenges the admiration, and\r\n    compels the approval of citizens whose only aim is to secure a\r\n    stable and beneficent Government—to preserve inviolate the faith\r\n    of the nation—to give security to capital, adequate reward to\r\n    labor, and equal rights to all.\r\n\r\n    With the grievances of disappointed office seekers, the masses\r\n    who thrive by their own toil, cannot be expected to find time or\r\n    patience to sympathize. Whether this Senator has had more or\r\n    that Senator less than his share of patronage, are insignificant\r\n    questions compared with the grave issues involved in a\r\n    Presidential canvass. It is the constitutional prerogative of\r\n    the President to make appointments to office. That he has not\r\n    exercised these functions unwisely, the success of his\r\n    administration abundantly proves.\r\n\r\n    Believing that General Grant’s civic career fitly supplements\r\n    his military greatness, that he has brought to the discharge of\r\n    his duties to the State the same energy, foresight and judgment\r\n    which marked his achievements in the field, and made his\r\n    campaigns from Donelson to Appomatox for ever illustrious; and\r\n    that he possesses and deserves the confidence of the American\r\n    people, we pledge to him our united and hearty support as a\r\n    candidate for re-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nHon. E. Delafield Smith, Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions,\r\npresented the following:\r\n\r\n    _First._ That the merchants and mechanics, the bankers and\r\n    business men of New York, represented in this meeting and in the\r\n    call under which it is assembled, are satisfied with the wisdom,\r\n    ability, moderation and fidelity with which the national\r\n    government is administered, and in common with the bulk of our\r\n    brethren throughout the Union favor the continuance of its\r\n    distinguished head in the office which he holds with usefulness\r\n    and honor.\r\n\r\n    _Second._ That the practical result of the coalition movement,\r\n    if successful, would be to restore the Democratic party to\r\n    power.\r\n\r\n    _Third._ That such a restoration, after the late glorious\r\n    triumph over rebellion, would read in history like the record of\r\n    a Tory resurrection at the close of our revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n    _Fourth._ That Republicans elected to office mainly by those who\r\n    assailed the Union at the South and at the North embarrassed its\r\n    defenders, would inevitably become serviceable to the powers\r\n    that sustain them, like those northern presidents who were\r\n    chosen by the South and did its bidding better than its own\r\n    statesmen.\r\n\r\n    _Fifth._ That the patriotism that made Grant President of the\r\n    Republic he saved, is akin to that which placed Washington at\r\n    the head of the nation he created. The trust was accepted by\r\n    each at a manifest sacrifice of interest and inclination, with\r\n    modest misgiving as to civic experience and qualification. But\r\n    having been well and wisely administered, the confidence implied\r\n    in a re-election is an appropriate reward for faithful services,\r\n    and accords with the broadest views of public policy.\r\n\r\n    _Sixth._ That against hostile criticisms and unfounded\r\n    imputations, against alluring promises and prismatic\r\n    theories,—we array the practical reforms constantly inaugurated\r\n    and the substantial results already achieved by the present\r\n    administration. The chronic vices of existing systems, unfairly\r\n    paraded to its injury, have been placed in a course of\r\n    amelioration or removal. The reduction of the national debt has\r\n    elicited the admiration of the world. Our diplomacy has made\r\n    peace the ally of national honor. And our President has been in\r\n    deed as in name a kind and “great father” to the Indian tribes\r\n    still lingering within our borders.\r\n\r\n    _Seventh._ That while honorable opposition is entitled to\r\n    respect, every effort to blacken, for political purposes, the\r\n    character of President Grant, is a crime against truth which\r\n    vindicates him, and an insult to the American people who honor\r\n    and exalt him. Pure in private as irreproachable in public life,\r\n    with strong convictions yet deferential to the popular will,\r\n    patient under attack, more ready to listen than to speak, with\r\n    no display and no ostentation—those who know him best bear\r\n    testimony to the sense, the sagacity, and the power of analysis\r\n    by which his utterances are characterized and impressed.\r\n\r\n    _Eighth._ That in the judgment of this meeting a majority of the\r\n    people of the country expect, desire, and decree the\r\n    renomination and re-election of Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n\r\n                   SPEECH OF HON. E. DELAFIELD SMITH.\r\n\r\n    Mr. E. Delafield Smith said:—Fellow Citizens:—It is manifest to\r\n    us all that President Grant will be renominated at the\r\n    Convention in Philadelphia. It is equally clear that such is the\r\n    wish of the American people. This is due to a confidence reposed\r\n    in him by the “plain people” of the country, which no\r\n    misrepresentation seems able to impair. His opponents assert\r\n    that the public declarations in his favor are influenced by the\r\n    office holders. But this cannot well be, for the office\r\n    _holders_ are always far outnumbered by the office _seekers_.\r\n    With regard to executive patronage, it is as true now as when\r\n    Talleyrand first said it, that every office conferred makes one\r\n    ingrate and forty-nine enemies. The truth is, possession of the\r\n    offices is a source, not of strength, but of actual weakness to\r\n    any political party. In spite of this, General Grant is so\r\n    strong and popular that a coalition is frantically sought as the\r\n    only and forlorn hope of defeating him. It is thought that the\r\n    Democratic masses can be carried over bodily to the few\r\n    Republican seceders. But the moment the Democratic organization\r\n    is relaxed, it will lose its hold upon thousands of its own\r\n    members, and they may and will prefer in voting for a Republican\r\n    to make the choice themselves, and they will rally in large\r\n    numbers to the hero of our patriotic armies. The coalition\r\n    meeting, lately held in this city, recalls the old arrangement\r\n    as to colored troops, where the officers were white men, but the\r\n    rank and file negroes. So here, the platform was covered with\r\n    Republicans, but the audience was made up of Democrats. In thus\r\n    acting with their old opponents our disaffected friends boast of\r\n    their independence, and impute servility to us. But they are\r\n    wrong. That man is most independent who is at once loyal to his\r\n    country, true to his party, and faithful to his friends! With\r\n    these brief observations, I move the adoption of the address and\r\n    resolutions.\r\n\r\nMy only apology for inserting the above address and resolutions is, that\r\nI believe they constitute a valuable epitome of a very important\r\nchapter, yet to be more fully written, of the political history of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nA greater criterion of the success of the meeting, however, was the\r\neditorial opinion of the _Evening Post_ next day, which had been for a\r\nlong time previously very bitter in its attacks upon General Grant. It\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “The meeting held last evening at the Cooper Institute was, we\r\n    believe, without precedent in our political history. It was\r\n    expressly called as a gathering of that branch of the Republican\r\n    party which desires the nomination and re-election of President\r\n    Grant. Yet, when it came together, the officers and speakers\r\n    assumed that it was a mass meeting of the Republicans of New\r\n    York. This is to say, according to the organizers and promoters\r\n    of this gathering, the one test of Republicanism now is the\r\n    political support of one man’s aspirations, and that before any\r\n    nomination has been made by that party. This is a singular\r\n    position to receive the approval, at least, by their\r\n    acquiescence, of such men as some scores of those whose names\r\n    are prominent in the report of the meeting, and who, as we know,\r\n    would prefer some other candidate than General Grant, if they\r\n    could hope to control the Philadelphia nomination.\r\n\r\n    “The power of this meeting was wholly in its organization. The\r\n    list of officers chosen by it is, on the whole, the best, most\r\n    reputable, and most influential commanded by any partisan\r\n    meeting within our recollection. There are a few names on it\r\n    which disgrace their fellows; there are many which carry no\r\n    weight, but an unusually large proportion of the very long list\r\n    are eminent and representative names in this city. The audience\r\n    assembled was in many respects in keeping with the officers. It\r\n    consisted mainly of reputable, thoughtful voters.”\r\n\r\nThe good work was continued until November with the result that is now\r\nhistorical.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sun_ said: “We believe that Henry Clews did more, in a\r\npecuniary way, to promote the success of Grant, than any Republican\r\nmillionaire of the Union League Club.”\r\n\r\nAnother mass meeting was held late in the fall. Referring to it, and\r\nother events of that period, the President’s Secretary writes a few days\r\nprior to the election as follows:\r\n\r\n                                    WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 2, 1872.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR CLEWS:\r\n\r\n    We are all greatly obliged for the documents and information\r\n    which you have sent us during the campaign. The President says\r\n    the list of vice-presidents of the last Cooper Institute meeting\r\n    is the most remarkable list of prominent names he has ever seen\r\n    upon one paper. It will of itself do great good.\r\n\r\n    Our news is charming from all quarters, and all our hopes will,\r\n    without doubt, be fully realized on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\n    If the defeat of the enemy is overwhelming, it will be\r\n    sufficient reward for all our labors.\r\n\r\n                                  Your very truly,\r\n\r\n                                       HORACE PORTER.\r\n\r\nTo show still further the interest which the leading merchants, bankers\r\nand business men of this city took in the movement to re-elect General\r\nGrant at that time, the following circular furnishes an excellent and\r\nhistorical record. It constitutes, in a small compass and compact form,\r\na valuable chapter of financial history:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CIRCULAR\r\n\r\n    _Of the Business Men of New York on the Financial Condition of\r\n    the National Debt of the United States. Further Reduction\r\n    October 1, 10,327,000 Dollars._\r\n\r\n    The undersigned, merchants, bankers and business men of New\r\n    York, respectfully submit the following statements for the\r\n    information of all parties interested therein:\r\n\r\n    The Republican candidate for President of the United States is\r\n    Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who was unanimously named for re-election\r\n    at Philadelphia, in May last.\r\n\r\n    At the commencement of Gen. Grant’s first term of office, March\r\n    4, 1869, the national debt was $2,525,000,000. On the first day\r\n    of September, of the present year, there had been paid and\r\n    cancelled of the principal of this debt, $348,000,000, leaving a\r\n    balance of principal remaining unpaid at that date, in\r\n    accordance with the official statement of the Secretary of the\r\n    Treasury, the sum of $2,177,000,000.\r\n\r\n    Of this amount, $1,177,000,000 are represented in a funded debt,\r\n    bearing interest in gold, while $400,000,000 remain unfunded in\r\n    Treasury circulation.\r\n\r\n    Up to the close of the last session of Congress, the annual\r\n    reduction of taxes, as measured by the rates of 1869, had been\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n               Internal revenue tax          $82,000,000\r\n\r\n               Income tax, (repealed,)        30,000,000\r\n\r\n               Duties on imposts,             58,000,000\r\n\r\n                                                     ———\r\n\r\n               Making a total reduction     $170,000,000\r\n                 of\r\n\r\n\r\n    The reduction of the yearly interest on the public debt exceeds\r\n    the sum of $23,200,000, of which $21,743,000 are saved by the\r\n    purchase and cancellation of the six per cent. public\r\n    securities.\r\n\r\n    A careful consideration of these results of a prudent and\r\n    faithful administration of the national Treasury, induces the\r\n    undersigned to express the confident belief, that the general\r\n    welfare of the country, the interests of its commerce and trade,\r\n    and the consequent stability of its public securities, would be\r\n    best promoted by the re-election of Gen. Grant to the office of\r\n    President of the United States.\r\n\r\n    New York, Oct. 4, 1872.\r\n\r\n        PHELPS, DODGE & CO.,\r\n        GEORGE OPDYKE & CO.,\r\n        A. A.

SAMUEL\r\n    JONES TILDEN, AS COUNSEL TO THE COMMITTEE, OBTAINED HIS GREAT START\r\n    IN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tweed Ring had considerable experience in and out of Wall Street for\r\nseveral years during the municipal reign of the famous Boss. I have made\r\nsome reference to their attempts to manipulate the market through tight\r\nmoney, in my biographical sketch of that Wall Street celebrity Henry N.\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nThe Ring was often highly subservient in assisting certain operators in\r\nspeculative deals in stocks, one notable instance being in Hannibal &\r\nSt. Jo. shares, which resulted in a terrible loss to Boss Tweed & Co.\r\nThis stock became quite neglected for a long period afterwards, and so\r\nremained until the famous “corner” was engineered many years after by\r\nJohn R. Duff, of Boston, through his New York broker, Wm. J. Hutchinson,\r\nand by which poor Duff was almost, if not entirely, ruined. It is only\r\njustice to Mr. Duff, in this connection, to state that he was not to\r\nblame, as an exhaustive investigation by the Governing Committee of the\r\nStock Exchange showed that his trouble chiefly arose through flagrant\r\ndishonesty and betrayal of trust on the part of his agent, in whom he\r\nreposed too much confidence.\r\n\r\nBoss Tweed and his special retainers sometimes made Wall Street\r\ninstrumental in engineering national and State political movements.\r\nAbout the time of an election, if their opponents happened to be in\r\npower, the Ring would produce a stringency in the money market, by\r\ncalling in simultaneously all the city money, which was usually on\r\ntemporary loans in the Street.\r\n\r\nThis the Ring managers would accomplish through some of the banks which\r\nwere the depositories of the city funds, and were under their control.\r\n\r\nBy this means they worked up a feeling of antagonism against the\r\nRepublicans who were in office, by throwing the blame on them, and thus\r\nrendering them odious in the eyes of those who had lost money in\r\nspeculation. The blame was not unnaturally fastened on the party in\r\npower, and most men, when they lose money, are credulous enough to\r\nbelieve anything that seems to account for the manner in which the loss\r\nhas been sustained. It seems to have a soothing effect upon their minds,\r\nand furnishes them with a tangible object upon which they may wreak\r\ntheir vengeance and feel satisfied. There is nothing so irritating to\r\nthe disappointed speculator as the harassing doubt of where to fix the\r\nblame.\r\n\r\nThe Tweed Ring supplied this long-felt want, and filled the aching void\r\nin the heart of the man who happened to get on the wrong side of the\r\nmarket. When speculators frequently had their margins “wiped out,” and\r\nwere almost beggared of everything except their votes, they found that\r\nconsolation which Wall Street refused them, in the sympathetic hearts of\r\nTweed’s “heelers,” who pointed to the poor office-holders of the\r\nRepublican party, representing them as the sole possessors of Pandora’s\r\nbox, which contained all evils that flesh is heir to.\r\n\r\nSo these financial disasters were brought about by the Tweed party for\r\nthe purpose of getting their friends into office, which always paid\r\ntribute to the Boss when he was instrumental in elevating a person to a\r\nfat position. He, himself, did not want any better office than receiver\r\ngeneral of this tribute.\r\n\r\nIn those days a Presidential election was largely influenced by the way\r\nPennsylvania went, so that it had grown into a political maxim, “As goes\r\nthe Keystone State so goes the Union.”\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1872, the year in which General Grant was the\r\nRepublican candidate for the second term, when it was decided that\r\nHorace Greeley should be the Democratic candidate, great efforts were\r\nmade to produce a panic in Wall Street. It was arranged by the Tweed\r\nparty that the panic should take place simultaneously with the State\r\nelection in Pennsylvania, so as to illustrate the evil results of\r\nRepublican rule, and turn the influence in favor of Mr. Greeley’s\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nI received intimation of this politico-speculative conspiracy, and\r\ncommunicated my information to Senator Conkling, who was stopping at the\r\nFifth Avenue Hotel at the time. I told him that the Democrats were\r\nworking up a panic to help to defeat General Grant. He said it was the\r\nfirst he had heard of it, but it was so like a move that Tweed and his\r\nparty would make, that he felt there was just cause for alarm about it,\r\nand he requested me to go and see Governor Morgan, and also George\r\nOpdyke, on the subject. I found that the Governor was at a church\r\nmeeting, and I left my card telling him to call upon me at the rooms of\r\nthe Republican National Committee, as I wanted to see him upon important\r\nbusiness. I left word for Mr. Opdyke to call also.\r\n\r\nThe Governor soon presented himself at the Committee rooms, and I\r\ndivulged to him my information and suspicions. He did not exhibit so\r\nmuch interest as I imagined the importance of the case demanded, and he\r\nappeared to doubt the correctness of the report of the political\r\nintentions of the Tweed Ring, or rather he seemed to imagine that the\r\nRing was hardly capable of a move that involved such subtlety and depth\r\nof design. Therein he greatly underestimated the power, resources and\r\nstatecraft of Peter “Brains” Sweeney. The Governor was of a phlegmatic\r\ntemperament, and it was difficult to convince him of anything that was\r\nnot very clearly demonstrable. I told him that my information was of\r\nsuch a positive and reliable nature that I knew I was right, and that if\r\nthere should be a panic in Wall Street I had serious apprehensions that\r\nit would prove disastrous to the Republicans in the national campaign.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morgan appointed a meeting for the next day to discuss the\r\nmatter more fully and obtain further light upon the subject. I took with\r\nme to see the Governor, whom I had now convinced of the reality of the\r\npolitical plot, Mr. George Opdyke and Mr. H. B. Claflin.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Governor had seen Travers, who, being an inveterate\r\nbear on the situation, had an inkling of what was in progress to break\r\nthe market. The Governor had satisfied himself that my representations\r\nwere correct, and that trouble was really brewing. He then entered with\r\nearnestness into the question of the best policy to be adopted to\r\nobstruct the schemes, and frustrate the purposes of the Democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI then suggested, that as the matter did not admit of delay, it was\r\nhighly essential that some one, or more, of us should go to Washington\r\nto see General Grant. The Governor said he could not go. I could not go,\r\nand neither could Mr. Claflin. So Mr. Opdyke, who was very ready in such\r\nmatters, consented to bear the important message in person, provided we\r\nall agreed to back him up by writing a strong letter to the President,\r\nsetting forth the facts in relation to the emergency. This we did, and\r\nMr. Opdyke left at once for Washington. This was on Friday evening, and\r\nhe transacted his business with more than ordinary despatch, and\r\nreturned on Sunday morning. He sent for me, and told me that he had\r\nexplained the matter to the President, who felt exceedingly grateful for\r\nthe warning which he and our letters had conveyed, and that he had\r\nforthwith consulted with the Secretary of the Treasury, and it was\r\nresolved to order the purchase, on Monday, of ten millions of bonds, and\r\nthe sale of ten millions of gold, for the purpose of averting, in\r\nadvance, any financial disturbance that might arise through the project\r\nof the Tweed Ring to create an artificial stringency in the money\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that these men who were engaged in the conspiracy to create a\r\npanic, and benefit themselves both politically and financially by its\r\nresults, were a deeply designing lot, and that under the law, gold could\r\nbe bid up, the highest bidders obtaining it, having the option of either\r\npaying by depositing their money in payment for it in the National\r\ndepositories, which were the Fourth National Bank and the Bank of\r\nCommerce, or else depositing it in the Sub-Treasury. If deposited in the\r\nlatter it would be locked up, and the effect intended by the Treasury,\r\nto make money easy, would be neutralized, in so far as the influence of\r\nthe money as a circulating medium was concerned.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to provide for that probable contingency, my firm\r\nsubscribed for the whole ten millions of gold, the names being the\r\nclerks of my office. We were awarded eight millions, and we paid the\r\nmoney into the Bank of Commerce, and the Fourth National Bank, through\r\nwhich it was brought into circulation.\r\n\r\nThus ten millions of greenbacks and also ten millions of gold came fresh\r\nfrom the Sub-Treasury into circulation immediately, promptly\r\nanticipating and defeating the machinations of the Ring.\r\n\r\nThe Tweed Ring being “all broke up” on this deal, the effect was magical\r\non the market. The plans of the conspirators had been entirely upset,\r\nand the Pennsylvania election took place a few days afterward with an\r\noverwhelming majority for the Republicans.\r\n\r\nHad the panic, which was projected by the Ring, taken place, the result\r\nmight have been otherwise, and the re-election of Grant thus\r\njeopardized.\r\n\r\nAfter this triumph over Tweed and his gang, I set my wits to work to\r\nplan their overthrow. I saw that their power was entirely money power,\r\nobtained by official position through official theft. I was satisfied\r\nthat these patriots who had put their hands up to the elbows in the City\r\nTreasury of New York were bent upon buying, stealing or otherwise\r\nobtaining their way to the National Treasury at Washington.\r\n\r\nThey had hoped to do there on a large scale what they had accomplished\r\non a smaller scale in the city of New York, where they were becoming\r\nrestive under their limited resources.\r\n\r\nIt was with the view of suppressing the dangerous aspirations of this\r\nband of political marauders that I originated the well known Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Seventy, and at the first meeting to organize this\r\ncommittee I nominated sixty-five of its members.\r\n\r\nThe committee was thus backed at the start by so many prominent citizens\r\nas to make it at once a power in the community.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time in many years the citizens of New York were\r\nemboldened to become outspoken on the subject of political plunder and\r\ntyranny, and against the officials who had ruled the city with a rod of\r\niron.\r\n\r\nFor a long time previous to this there had been grave suspicions that\r\nrobbery on a large scale was being perpetrated, but no one dared to give\r\nutterance to the fact except with bated breath and in half smothered\r\nwhispers. No one, with the possible exception of a few who were not\r\ntaxpayers, had the temerity to open his mouth to say a word against the\r\ndesperate men who controlled the destinies of the city, through fear\r\nthat on the event of any remark reaching the ears of the Boss or his\r\nminions, the property of the person thus offending should be marked up\r\nto an artificial value and his taxes accordingly increased. This was one\r\nof the most effective methods pursued by the Ring to choke off\r\nunfriendly criticism by the rich men of the city. In this way the power\r\nof some of the most influential citizens became paralyzed, being held in\r\ncomplete subjection under the terrorism of this subtle system of\r\nblackmailing.\r\n\r\nThe power the Ring possessed of covering up the rascality of its members\r\nand bamboozling the public is hardly conceivable at this day except by\r\nthose who had experience of it at the time. As an instance of this I may\r\nstate that some time prior to the appointment of the Committee of\r\nSeventy certain accusations were ventilated against Richard Connolly,\r\nthe City Comptroller. He put on a bold front, and insisted upon an\r\ninvestigation of his department by a committee of leading and prominent\r\ncitizens. He named his committee, who were Moses Taylor, Marshall\r\nRoberts and John Jacob Astor. These were men against whom no person\r\ncould have any objection. They were wealthy and independent citizens,\r\nand it might have been difficult at the time to have selected any other\r\nthree who commanded greater confidence in the community. The\r\ninvestigation, through the unblushing effrontery and audaciousness of\r\nConnolly and his “pals,” resulted in an acquittal of Mr. Connolly, which\r\ngave him a new lease of political life, and rendered it more dangerous\r\nthan ever for any one to utter a word of hostile criticism against his\r\nmethods of managing the city finances.\r\n\r\nResults showed, when the Ring was exposed, that Connolly had made the\r\nvery best use of this investigation in appropriating additional sums out\r\nof the City Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Ring was now supreme in city affairs, and the city was under a reign\r\nof terror. This state of things existed until the summer of 1872, when\r\nthe Committee of Seventy got into harness, after which the despotic\r\nthieves that had ruled the roost so long, were driven from power one\r\nafter another in rapid succession, and scattered to the four corners of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nThe task of ousting this brazen band of plunderers, root and branch, was\r\nattended with considerable difficulty, as their resources were so\r\nnumerous and powerful. When they were no longer able to exercise their\r\narbitrary power they stooped to every form of cajolery and bribery in\r\norder to adhere to the remnant of their official authority. As an\r\nillustration of this, I may state that at the beginning of my efforts in\r\nconnection with the Committee of Seventy I was waited upon by a member\r\nof the Ring and asked if I would not accept the position of City\r\nChamberlain. I said: “That is a matter, of course, which I could not\r\ndecide upon at once, as there is no vacancy at present. It will be time\r\nenough for me to consider the matter when a vacancy occurs, and then\r\nwhen the position is offered to me.”\r\n\r\nThis answer carried with it an intimation, which I had intended, with a\r\nview of drawing out some of the internal methods of procedure in such\r\ncases, that I would probably accept the position and help to smooth over\r\nimpending revelations. I thought that the end which the Committee had in\r\nview justified this means of mildly extorting an important secret in\r\nmethods of Ring management, that was calculated to aid us in the work of\r\nmunicipal reform.\r\n\r\nNext day I was again waited upon by one of Tweed’s most trusty friends,\r\nwho graciously informed me that the City Chamberlain had resigned, and\r\nthat there was a vacancy which I could fill to the entire satisfaction\r\nof the then appointing power. I desired him to convey my feelings of\r\ndeep gratitude to the powers that were then on the point of being\r\ndethroned, and to say that I very respectfully declined the flattering\r\noffer. I said that I had thought earnestly over the matter since the\r\nprevious day, and as I was a member of the Committee of Seventy, which\r\nwas a reforming organization, I felt that I could not conscientiously\r\naccept the position.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that the office should be filled immediately, and it\r\nwas next offered to Mr. F. A. Palmer, President of the Broadway Bank,\r\nwhich had been one of the Ring’s depositories of the city funds.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the majority of the city officials had resigned and\r\ntaken their flight to parts unknown. They were scattered broadcast over\r\nthe world. Some had gone to Europe, some to Cuba, and others to that\r\nfavorite and paradisaical colony of defaulters, the New Dominion,\r\nleaving the Committee of Seventy, as a reform and revolutionary body, in\r\ncomplete control of the city.\r\n\r\nTweed remained, but was not quite so audacious in putting his pet\r\ninterrogative, “What are you going to do about it?” He seemed to be\r\nconvinced that the Committee of Seventy meant business. Mayor Oakey Hall\r\nalso remained, and facetiously protested that as far as he was concerned\r\neverything was “O. K.”\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Samuel J. Tilden began to loom into prominence about this time.\r\nThrough the influence of William F. Havemeyer, he was chosen one of the\r\nthree legal advisers of the committee. Abraham B. Lawrence and Wm. H.\r\nPeckham were the other two. Mr. Tilden was quick to seize this\r\nopportunity of sudden prominence to bring himself to the front and pose\r\nas a great reformer. Had it not been for the Committee of Seventy, I\r\nbelieve it is very doubtful whether this great reformer would ever have\r\nbeen known as such, and it is also exceedingly problematical whether he\r\nwould have ever got the chance of being counted out, or, attempting\r\nthrough the magic of his occult cyphers, to count anybody else out of\r\nthe Presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL JONES TILDEN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n            HON.

TILDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TILDEN BEGAN TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE IN CONNECTION WITH WILLIAM H.\r\n    HAVEMEYER.—TILDEN’S GREAT FORTE IN POLITICS.—HE IMPROVES HIS\r\n    OPPORTUNITY WITH THE DISCERNMENT OF GENIUS.—HOW TILDEN BECAME ONE OF\r\n    THE COUNSEL OF THE “COMMITTEE OF SEVENTY.”—HIS POLITICAL ELEVATION\r\n    AND FAME DATING FROM THIS LUCKY EVENT.—THE SAGE OF GREYSTONE A TRULY\r\n    GREAT MAN.—ATTAINS MARVELOUS SUCCESS BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY AND BRAIN\r\n    POWER.—HE NOT ONLY DESERVED SUCCESS AND RESPECT, BUT COMMANDED\r\n    THEM.—HOW HIS LARGE GENEROSITY WAS MANIFESTED IN HIS LAST WILL AND\r\n    TESTAMENT.—THE ATTEMPT TO BREAK THAT PRECIOUS PUBLIC DOCUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. H. Havemeyer had long been associated with Mr. Tilden in\r\nrailroad wrecking and the reorganization of broken concerns of this\r\ncharacter. Through this process both these gentlemen became wealthy.\r\nWhen, therefore, Mr. Havemeyer extended the right hand of fellowship to\r\nhis confidential companion in money making affairs, and invited him to\r\nofficiate as one of the counsel of three for the Committee of Seventy,\r\nMr. Tilden was sharp enough to appreciate the opportunity, which he\r\nseized with avidity.\r\n\r\nHe was quick to discern the tide in the affairs of men which, when taken\r\nat the flood, leads on to fortune. He did not wait until the tide began\r\nto ebb, but, like an able seaman, set his sail at the propitious moment\r\nto catch the prosperous breeze as well as the tide. Thus, through a\r\nlucky chance and other men’s exertions, Mr. Tilden was raised high on\r\nthe very crest of the tidal wave of reform, almost before he knew it.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, this happy accident of being one of the trinity\r\nof legal advisers to our committee, for which he was well paid, did not\r\nlead immediately so much to fortune as to fame, but it formed an\r\nimportant portion of the pedestal upon which the several millions which\r\nhe so munificently bequeathed to educational purposes were subsequently\r\nraised. To fame he was then comparatively unknown. The Committee of\r\nSeventy enabled him to obtain the start which was chiefly instrumental\r\nin elevating him to a position of renown in national politics.\r\n\r\nTilden’s great forte in politics, as in financial affairs and railroad\r\nmatters, was to set a cash value on everything, and measure it\r\naccordingly. If he opened his “barrel” the contents were not distributed\r\nindiscriminately, but on the principle directed by the most expert\r\njudgment of where the money would do the most good—according to Mr.\r\nTilden’s ideas of good. What they were I don’t attempt to explain, but,\r\nlike the popular novelist, charitably leave them to the inference of the\r\nreader, or to that expert Moses who so ably deciphered occult telegrams\r\nfrom Florida and Louisiana when there was such a close contest for the\r\noffice of National Executive.\r\n\r\nWithout departing from the main issue of my subject, however, I may say\r\nthat the position which Mr. Tilden was enabled to assume as counsellor\r\nto our committee made it possible for him to rise from the, not to say\r\ndignified, although money-making, attitude of railroad wrecker to that\r\nof Governor of the Empire State of the Union, thus paving the way for\r\nhim to become almost a successful candidate for the highest position in\r\nthe gift of the Great Republic.\r\n\r\nSuch a sudden transition from comparative obscurity was enough to turn\r\nany ordinary head.\r\n\r\nSeeing the unexpected course that both our local and national history\r\nhave taken, it is impossible to say what might have been the course of\r\nthis man’s destiny, and the fate of this new Daniel come to judgment in\r\ncanal ring masters, had it not been that his friend Havemeyer discovered\r\nhim at an opportune moment, and rescued him from manifest oblivion in\r\nthe nick of time.\r\n\r\nIt must be said, on behalf of Mr. Tilden, however, that he improved the\r\noccasion with the discernment of genius, and in the fullest degree, and\r\nto the highest extent, thoroughly justified Havemeyer’s choice.\r\n\r\nThe soundness of that proverbial philosophy which holds that lightning\r\nnever strikes twice in the same place seems to have been fully\r\nappreciated by Mr. Havemeyer, although this was a little ahead of the\r\ntime that John Tyndall and other scientists of the modern school of\r\ndiscovery had demonstrated some of the recent wonders of electricity.\r\n\r\nTilden struck while the iron was hot, and though he failed to reach the\r\nhighest pinnacle of his soaring ambition, he demonstrated the wonderful\r\npossibilities which lie in the path of obscure men who are blest with\r\nfriends who look out for their welfare, and who have the precaution to\r\nturn the wheel of fortune in the right direction.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the result of fate, genius, or wise direction, or a\r\ncombination of all these attributes, I don’t pretend to decide, but I\r\nhave noted the simple facts from my own observation and experience,\r\nassociated with the rise and financial progress of the Hon. Samuel J.\r\nTilden, leaving others deeper in scientific and philosophic matters to\r\nsupply the details and hidden mysteries of the causes of his marvellous\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Seventy, when entering upon its labors, passed a\r\nresolution authorizing the appointment of a subcommittee by the chair to\r\nselect and retain three lawyers to represent it in the matters of\r\nlitigation that might arise in connection with the investigation. Mr.\r\nHavemeyer, being a member of the sub-committee, through his influence\r\nSamuel J. Tilden was one of the three appointed.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader an idea of the power and prestige of the Committee of\r\nSeventy at that time it is only necessary to state that it was\r\ninstrumental in making Mr. Abraham Lawrence one of the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, and Mr. W. H. Peckham, the third counsel, could have\r\nobtained almost any judgeship he had desired, with perfect facility.\r\n\r\nThese cases are on official record, and are living examples to show that\r\nI am not exaggerating. Judge Lawrence still adorns the bench, with an\r\nexcellent record behind him, and Mr. Peckham has been a prominent figure\r\nin many of the most important suits that have become historic in the\r\nState and City of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden saw the power which this committee, used as an instrument of\r\nrecommendation, wielded, and he set his astute mind to avail himself of\r\nthe reformatory advantages which it afforded. The committee was a reform\r\nbody, and he saw his opportunity, as one of its counsel, to become a\r\nreformer also. He builded almost better than he knew, if I may be\r\npermitted to quote Scripture in this case, and he did not build on a\r\nsandy foundation either. He planted himself on the solid rock of reform\r\nprinciples, independent of politics or previous condition. It must be\r\nsaid, to his credit, that he used the material at his disposal with\r\ngreat tact and good judgment, and made an excellent reformer.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been said about him by political opponents, the late\r\nSage of Greystone must be judged in this sinful world by the positions\r\nto which he honorably attained. He became a prominent and most estimable\r\ncitizen of our great Republic, and had it not been for his age, and\r\ncertain physical infirmities, the existence of which was a matter of\r\ndispute, he would have made a very good President, judging from his\r\nrecord as a Governor.\r\n\r\nI have not intended to say anything especially disparaging or\r\nill-natured about Mr. Tilden through any hostile feeling towards him, of\r\nwhich I never had any. My intention has been simply to show how easily a\r\nman can rise if he has the ability required to take passage on the tide\r\nof prosperity exactly at its flow, the magic point of embarkation which\r\nWilliam Shakespeare has suggested.\r\n\r\nSo what I have stated about Mr. Tilden is in the main rather to his\r\ncredit than otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor a man who attained such an elevated position of success by his own\r\nindustry and brain power I have the highest respect and the deepest\r\nsympathy, knowing myself a good deal about the toil attendant upon\r\nclimbing above the heads of the great majority of the “masses” with a\r\nstrong contingent of the envious “classes” always using their best\r\nefforts to pull a man down who attempts to aspire above a certain level.\r\nIn fact, Mr. Tilden not only deserved success and respect, but he\r\ncommanded them. Such a man should always be accorded most graciously his\r\nwell-earned deserts.\r\n\r\nI can, therefore, conscientiously subscribe myself one of the great\r\nadmirers of his successful career on the whole, bearing always in mind\r\nthat human nature is not perfect, and that there are few, if any, who\r\nhave not had some murky clouds cast over their fair fame.\r\n\r\nAlthough on strict moral principles we should never do evil that good\r\nmay come, yet the manner in which Tilden disposed of the greater portion\r\nof his fortune will, even in the eyes of straight-laced moralists, go\r\nfar to cover a multitude of sins in the acquisition of his wealth. There\r\nare probably few, if any, churches in the land that would have refused a\r\nportion of the bequest, no matter how familiar their members or their\r\nclergy might have been with Mr. Tilden’s railroad methods.\r\n\r\nIn this imperfect sketch of the turning point of prosperity in Mr.\r\nTilden’s career, I have desired to show how little it requires to change\r\nthe entire current of a man’s apparent destiny. A man who attains such\r\neminent success has his Creator to thank for endowing him in the first\r\ninstance with the capacity to take advantage of the chances thrown in\r\nhis way, and his own smartness for turning them to the best account.\r\n\r\nI have taken Mr. Tilden up and devoted to his extraordinary career a few\r\npages, from personal reminiscences, in this book, owing to the fact that\r\nhe was identified with a number of railroads in the way which I have\r\nindicated above. His position in this respect naturally classifies him\r\nwith some of our most prominent Wall Street speculators, investors and\r\noperators, and he thus naturally falls within the scope of the main\r\nsubject of this book.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden, in his will, ordered that if the will should be contested by\r\nany of the beneficiaries each and all of the contesting parties should\r\nbe disinherited.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this prohibition, George H. and Samuel J. Tilden, sons of\r\nHenry A. Tilden, and nephews of the testator, contested the validity of\r\nthe instrument, not on the ground of incapacity or undue influence, but\r\nupon construction.\r\n\r\nHenry L. Clinton and Aaron Vanderpoel were the lawyers for the\r\ncontestants.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the will of a man so deeply learned in the law as Mr.\r\nTilden was, should be questioned as to whether it was a legal document\r\nor not. But such was the ground of the contest. The point was this: The\r\nresiduary clause empowers the trustees to apply to the Legislature for\r\nan act to incorporate a body to be called the Tilden Trust. This body,\r\nwhen incorporated, was to become the legatee. This method of procedure,\r\naccording to the opinion of learned counsel in the law, bequeathed to\r\nthe trustee under the will the power to name the public legatee of the\r\ntestator. It seems that a testator has no power to do this, according to\r\nthe recent decisions of the Courts of last resort in this country,\r\nwhich, it would seem, Mr. Tilden had not read. Nobody but the testator\r\nhimself has power to name the legatee. It appears he had the decision of\r\nthe English Court in his mind, which allows of this method of\r\nbequeathing property. Following is the residuary clause in full, bearing\r\nupon this point: “I request my said executors and trustees to obtain, as\r\nspeedily as possible, from the Legislature an act of incorporation of an\r\ninstitution to be known as the Tilden Trust, with capacity to establish\r\nand maintain a free library and reading-room in the city of New York,\r\nand to promote such scientific and educational objects as my said\r\nexecutors and trustees may more particularly designate. Such corporation\r\nshall have not less than five trustees, with power to fill vacancies in\r\ntheir number, and in case said institution shall be incorporated in a\r\nform and manner satisfactory to my said executors and trustees during\r\nthe lifetime of the survivor of the two lives in being, upon which the\r\ntrust of my general estate herein created is limited, to wit, the lives\r\nof Ruby S. Tilden and Susie Whittlesey, I hereby authorize my said\r\nexecutors and trustees to organize the said corporation, designate the\r\nfirst trustees thereof, and to convey to or apply to the use of the same\r\nthe rest, residue and remainder of all my real and personal estate not\r\nspecifically disposed of by this instrument, or so much thereof as they\r\nmay deem expedient, but subject, nevertheless, to the special trusts\r\nherein directed to be constituted for particular persons, and to the\r\nobligations to make and keep good the said special trusts, provided that\r\nthe said corporation shall be authorized by law to assume such\r\nobligation. But in case such institution shall not be so incorporated\r\nduring the lifetime of the survivors of the said Ruby S. Tilden and\r\nSusie Whittlesey, or if for any cause or reason my said executors shall\r\ndeem it expedient to convey said rest, residue and remainder, or any\r\npart thereof, or to apply the same, or any part thereof, to the said\r\ninstitution, I authorize my said executors and trustees to apply the\r\nrest, residue and remainder of my properly, real and personal, after\r\nmaking good the said special trusts herein directed to be constituted,\r\nor such portion thereof as they may not deem it expedient to apply to\r\nits use to such charitable, educational and scientific purposes, as in\r\nthe judgment of my said executors and trustees will render the said\r\nrest, residue and remainder of my property most widely and substantially\r\nbeneficial to the interests of mankind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _C Van Derbilt_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n                COMMODORE VANDERBILT.\r\n            —HOW HIS MAMMOTH FORTUNE WAS ACCUMULATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERRYMAN.—STEAMBOAT OWNER.—RUNS A GREAT COMMERCIAL FLEET.—THE FIRST AND\r\n    GREATEST OF RAILROAD KINGS.—THE HARLEM “CORNER.”—REORGANIZATION OF\r\n    N. Y. CENTRAL.—HOW HE MILKED HIS CO-SPECULATORS.—HIS FORTUNE.—ITS\r\n    VAST INCREASE BY WM. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous man connected with Wall Street in my early days of\r\nspeculation was “Commodore” Vanderbilt. Without going minutely into the\r\nearly exploits of the man, it will be sufficient, for the purposes of\r\nthis narrative, that I trace his start in life in connection with a\r\nrow-boat of which he was Captain, plying between Staten Island,\r\nGovernor’s Island, and New York, in which he himself did the rowing.\r\nThis enterprise, in course of time, grew into one with boats propelled\r\nby steam, instead of manual labor. During his progress as ferryman he\r\nbecame proprietor of a hotel at New Brunswick, New Jersey. This side\r\nissue did not prove very lucrative, perhaps, because the Commodore, with\r\nall his versatile ability, did not possess the special talents required\r\nto keep a hotel. The hotel still exists, and is situated near the\r\nrailroad station, and is now, as it was then, merely a railroad tavern.\r\nThe first vivid recollection of the Commodore in Wall Street “dickering”\r\nwas in connection with the Nicaragua Transit Company, the capital of\r\nwhich was over $4,000,000. He became President of the Company, and soon\r\nafterward the head and front of the whole enterprise. The Directors and\r\nstockholders, and in fact every one else connected with the Company,\r\nwere soon crushed into nonentities. When their complete subjection was\r\nobtained, the Commodore loomed up into gigantic dimensions, and, as he\r\nexpanded, the Nicaragua Company became small by degrees and beautifully\r\nless in inverse proportion. Eventually the greatly depressed\r\nstockholders, like the worm when trodden under foot, turned and showed\r\nresentment. The case came into Court and was the subject of ordinary\r\ninvestigation, but I never heard of the Company recovering anything. I\r\npresume their claims were relegated to the profit and loss account in\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Commodore started a line of steamers in opposition to\r\nthe fleet of Pacific Mail, and kept his boats running until he was\r\nbought off. About this time an event happened which has preserved for\r\nposterity a good story, highly characteristic of the Commodore. His\r\nson-in-law, James M. Cross, had conceived the idea of embarking in the\r\nwholesale leather business in the “Swamp.” He had been talked into it by\r\nan experienced man who was to be his partner. A store was secured, and\r\neverything put under way for the start, with the exception of the\r\ncapital, which Mr. Cross had agreed to contribute against the experience\r\nof his partner. The amount was to be $50,000. Mr. Cross, knowing that\r\nthe Commodore had at this time become rich and prosperous, felt\r\nsatisfied that it was only necessary to make application to his\r\nenterprising father-in-law for the amount required. Thereupon, with the\r\nconfidence begotten of implicit trust, he approached the Commodore for\r\nthis temporary accommodation, giving him a full description of the\r\nnature of the business. After listening attentively to the statement of\r\nhis esteemed son-in-law, the Commodore said in reply: “Now, James, if I\r\nlet you have this $50,000 to put in the leather business, how much do\r\nyou think you will be able to make for your share out of the profits?”\r\nMr. Cross thought the best position to take with a rigid business man\r\nlike his father-in-law was to be prudently conservative in his\r\nexpectations, and to keep all his Colonel Seller prospects in the\r\nbackground. After a few moments reflection he replied: “I believe I am\r\nalmost certain to make $5,000 a year.” The Commodore promptly responded:\r\n“James, as I can do better than that myself in handling $50,000, I will\r\ngive you $5,000 a year hereafter, and you may consider yourself in my\r\nemploy at that salary.” There was no way for James to wriggle out of it,\r\nand he accepted the situation with apparent good grace, whatever his\r\ninternal emotions may have been at the time. The Commodore forthwith\r\ndispatched Mr. Cross to San Francisco to manage his steamboat business\r\nthere. He soon discovered, however, that James was hardly aggressive\r\nenough for the go-ahead fellows on the gold coast, and he was recalled.\r\nAfter looking around some time for a man possessing the necessary\r\nrequirements to be placed in successful competition with the adventurous\r\nspirits of the Pacific Slope, his search was rewarded by an introduction\r\nto Commodore C. K. Garrison, then in command of a Mississippi steamboat.\r\nGarrison had established his reputation for being the best euchre player\r\non the river, and for much besides which that term implies. He was brave\r\nand fearless—in fact, in some respects, a Jim Bludso of real life, with\r\nthe self-sacrificing qualities of that hero largely discounted, or\r\nperhaps entirely left out. It required men of mettle in those days to\r\nrun a steamboat on the Father of Waters, when the greater portion of the\r\npassengers belonged to the gambling fraternity, and were all experts\r\nwith the bowie knife and the ready revolver.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore had an interview with Garrison, which resulted in an\r\nengagement, and he was sent to San Francisco as the Commodore’s agent.\r\nIt was soon found that he was the man for the Wild West, and he was not\r\nslow to appreciate his own value and importance to the increasing\r\nfortunes of his employer. He struck very often for higher wages, and was\r\nalways able to command his price. He rose, from one advance to another,\r\nuntil his salary at that day had reached the marvellous figure of\r\n$60,000 a year. Numerous stories of Garrison’s fabulous prosperity on\r\nthe Pacific Coast reached this city and the ears of the Commodore, and\r\nhis fame began to penetrate farther than the name of the latter had ever\r\nbeen heard. These accounts had their effect on a mind so naturally\r\nenvious as that of the Commodore. He began to realize the humiliating\r\nfact that, instead of Garrison being in his employ, the former captain\r\nof the Mississippi steamboat had him in tow, and was everywhere regarded\r\nas the Boss, while Vanderbilt was simply supposed to be his Eastern\r\nagent. This brought matters to the point where patience ceased to be a\r\nvirtue, and the connection was severed. Soon after this the Commodore\r\nsold out to the Pacific Mail Company, which again became a monopoly, and\r\nas the fight had been a losing one to him, he was obliged to find other\r\nwaters for his boats.\r\n\r\nSince his advent with a common row boat on the waters of our own\r\nhandsome bay, thence through the gradations of ferry boats and\r\nsteamboats, nothing but unremitting success had attended his ventures,\r\nuntil his unequal struggle in competition with Pacific Mail. He appeared\r\nto have met his Trafalgar when he encountered that fleet. His\r\ndissociation with Garrison seemed for a time to forebode disaster. He\r\ngathered himself up temporarily again, but never took to the waters so\r\nkindly afterwards. He began to feel that his financial destiny was\r\nverging towards a firmer foundation. His last boat was the famous\r\nsteamship Vanderbilt, which was recognized at the time as one of the\r\nfinest ships to be found on any sea. He made a present of her to the\r\nGovernment during our great National struggle, or according to another\r\naccount, he lent her, and the Government kept her. The Commodore at one\r\ntime had a fleet of sixty ships.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore became convinced that the growing prospects of railroads\r\npointed to greater facilities for transportation in the future, and also\r\na more profitable investment than those watery regions which had\r\nhitherto appeared to be his natural element. He promptly resolved to\r\nturn his back on the domain of Neptune, and to devote his great energies\r\nto enterprises on land. He saw there was comparatively little room for\r\ndevelopment in water traffic, while in the railroad business the field\r\nwas practically unlimited.\r\n\r\nHe then commenced to buy up Harlem Railroad stock, so as to obtain\r\ncontrol of that road, and in the operation got up the celebrated Harlem\r\n“corner.” Application had been made to the Legislature for some\r\nadvantages in connection with the road, which were refused for reasons\r\nbest known to leading members of that body. In the meantime Harlem stock\r\nhad been knocked down to a very low figure. The Commodore remained in\r\nambush, and was secretly purchasing it. He then went to the Legislature\r\nto get his bill passed. Most of the members of the Legislature thought\r\nthey had got the “deadwood” on the Commodore, and enlisted a large\r\nnumber of their friends in the enterprise. They attempted “to work the\r\nCommodore for all he was worth,” and for a time appeared anxious to pass\r\nthe measure required. On the strength of this anticipated action on the\r\npart of the Legislature the stock advanced, when the members sold\r\n“short” and failed to legislate. The stock naturally went down, and\r\nVanderbilt bought it up. The collapse anticipated by the Legislature did\r\nnot take place, and, instead of that, the Commodore got a “corner” in\r\nthe stock, and the members of the Legislature were the parties mulcted.\r\nThey had, therefore, all to go to the Commodore’s office, and settle up\r\nwith him on his own terms, and he made arrangements to get his measure\r\nin favor of the road through the Legislature as part of the bargain.\r\nThis transaction is more fully described in another chapter.\r\n\r\nHis next great enterprise was in connection with the New York Central.\r\nHaving successfully euchred the legislators in the matter of Harlem, he\r\nwas encouraged to play a still higher game. As soon as he obtained\r\ncontrol of this property, it seemed as if it had been touched by a magic\r\nwand, or that famous stone of Midas, contact with which turned\r\neverything into gold. Prior to this event the road had been dragged\r\nalong under the management of Dean Richmond, Samuel Sloan and Henry\r\nKeep, without any signs of prosperity; but when Vanderbilt took hold of\r\nit there was a sudden change to visible progress and prosperity. It\r\nnever looked behind afterwards, and both enterprises have enjoyed signal\r\nand increasing success ever since, thus illustrating the marvellous\r\ncapacity of the Commodore for the organization and management of large\r\nenterprises. The hydraulic operations of the Commodore with the stock of\r\nthis property would alone furnish material for a very interesting\r\nchapter. Sending it up on one occasion at a bound, between Saturday and\r\nMonday, 20 per cent., was a new move in manipulation which caused some\r\nof the boldest operators on the Stock Exchange to stand aghast. He kept\r\nworking the stock up and down, in some such way as Mr. S. V. White now\r\nkeeps toying with Lackawanna, until he “milked” the street sometimes\r\nvery dry. He kept the tempting prize of a coming dividend glittering\r\nbefore the eyes of the dazzled imaginations of his friends who were\r\ndealing in the stock, but the “milking” process was so ably managed\r\nthat, when the famous 80 per cent. dividend was actually declared, they\r\nhad become so poor that they were unable to carry any of the stock, so\r\nas to avail themselves of the profits. There was but one man that I know\r\nof who reaped any benefit from it, and that was an old friend of the\r\nCommodore, who still lives, and who had met with signal reverses in some\r\nof the Erie deals at the time Mr. Gould so ably managed that concern.\r\nThis man had been wiped out in Erie, and his depressed condition awoke a\r\nsympathetic cord momentarily in the heart of the Commodore. He gave his\r\nfriend the tip the day before the dividend was declared, and he found\r\nanother friend who bought enough of stock to realize $700,000, which was\r\ndivided between them. This is the solitary exception within my knowledge\r\nwhere the Commodore failed to bag the entire game without “saying turkey\r\nonce” to any person connected with the deal.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Commodore affords singular scope for reflection on the\r\nimmense possibility of a great business capacity to amass a huge fortune\r\nin a few years, especially in this country. The Commodore and his son\r\nWilliam H., in a little more than half a century, accumulated the\r\nlargest private fortune in the world, excepting the aggregate wealth of\r\nall the Rothschilds combined, which has been the result of the most\r\nexpert financiering in all the capitals of Europe through several\r\ngenerations, with all the resources of the greatest monarchs on the\r\nearth to back their various enterprises. With all these advantages in\r\nfavor of the Rothschilds, the Vanderbilt fortune amounts to two-thirds\r\nof the sum total of theirs. The result is certainly astounding when\r\nsubmitted to a test of the highest standard of comparison that can be\r\nfound anywhere on this globe. But, wonderful as the success of the\r\nCommodore was in its rapid gradations, from the possession of a rowboat\r\non our bay to that of a fleet of sixty-six steamboats that brought\r\nmercantile argosies from all parts of the world, and in later years his\r\ngreat railroad acquisitions, yet the success of his son is more\r\nmarvellous still.\r\n\r\nIn seventy years the Commodore arose from nothing financially to be the\r\nproud possessor of $90,000,000. Wm. H. obtained $75,000,000 of that and\r\nnearly trebled it in a tenth part of the time. He made three times as\r\nmuch in seven years as his father made in seventy, or he made as much on\r\nan average every two and one-half years as his father had done during\r\nthe three score and ten of his active business and speculative career.\r\nIf any person having the necessary amount of temerity had ever ventured\r\nto make such a prediction as this in the presence of the old Commodore,\r\nwhat a natural burn idiot he would have been regarded by that grand old\r\nman. If the spirits of the departed ever visited the glimpses of the\r\nmoon in these days, what a profound sense of humiliation that of old\r\nVanderbilt must feel, as it makes its nightly rounds through those\r\nspacious marble corridors in Fifth avenue, or, perched on the dome of\r\nthe Grand Central Depot, it contemplates the mighty development and\r\nexpansion of its earthly designs, now extended far beyond the limits of\r\nwhat its highest ambition had dared to foreshadow.\r\n\r\nSome people may argue that it required greater ability to acquire these\r\nfirst $90,000,000 than the present sum total of the wealth of the\r\nVanderbilts. Those who argue thus, however, have no precedent to suggest\r\ntheir position. An instance of such prosperity on so large a scale in so\r\nshort a time has never occurred in the history of financiering. The\r\naccumulations in all the wealthy families that I know of have been\r\ncomparatively slow, and the history of the family of European\r\nmillionaires shows a similar principle of gradation, except, indeed,\r\nthat the gradation in the majority of instances has gone backwards. Very\r\nfew wealthy men, with the exception of the Rothschilds, the Astors and a\r\nfew others, have had any children capable of increasing their wealth,\r\nexcept where it was almost impossible to do otherwise under the law of\r\nprimogeniture. In this country, therefore, where the law of distribution\r\nhas full scope, Wm. H. Vanderbilt, who had to that time been regarded as\r\na man of very moderate capacity, proved himself to be the ablest\r\nfinancier of which there is any record either in ancient or modern\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nJay Gould, with all the resources of science at his disposal, and all\r\nthe talent that money could command, with newspapers, politicians,\r\nlawyers, judges, and courts at his will, with as good a start,\r\nfinancially dating from 1878, as Wm. H. Vanderbilt had, has been left\r\nfar behind in the race for wealth, and for the highest prize ever gained\r\nby one man in any nation. It has been truly said that a fool can make\r\nmoney, but it takes a wise man to keep it. Wm. H. Vanderbilt’s financial\r\nwisdom, as well as his ability, was signally displayed in keeping this\r\ngreat fortune intact, besides adding fully three times as much more to\r\nit; and it proves that his father made no mistake in selecting him to\r\nhand his name and fortune down to posterity. This immense pile of\r\n“filthy lucre,” however, in spite of all the credit that is justly due\r\nto its late manager, has had one serious drawback from a public\r\nstandpoint. In fact, the very announcement of this mammoth fortune in\r\nthe newspapers, at the time of Mr. Wm. H. Vanderbilt’s death, had a most\r\ndemoralizing effect upon a large number of the wealthy portion of the\r\ncommunity, who began to feel that they were nonentities in comparison.\r\nIn making this statement I absolve the Vanderbilt family from any blame.\r\nEvery man in this great Republic has the privilege of walking in the\r\nfootsteps of the two great Vanderbilts if he only has the ability; but\r\nit would not be wisdom for a large number of men to attempt it. They\r\nwould be pretty certain to “get left.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the distribution of the Vanderbilt wealth, however, has\r\nbrought discontent to many a home where happiness reigned before. It\r\ncould hardly be otherwise, constituted as human nature is, and\r\nespecially human nature in our highly strung commercial society, where\r\nthe spirit of ambition is always strenuously aiming at higher flights.\r\nPeople who heretofore had considered themselves rich, and socially\r\nimportant, with a million or so to draw upon, felt that they were mere\r\nciphers in the scale of wealth; they seemed to themselves to be\r\nfinancially blighted, and miserably poor in contrast with the colossal\r\nmagnitude of the Vanderbilt possessions as exhibited in the Surrogate’s\r\nCourt. The plain, cold, prosy figures brought out there read like a\r\nromance, or the story of Sinbad the Sailor and the Valley of Diamonds.\r\nBut it was all stern reality. This is why the feelings which suffer from\r\nthis contrast are so deeply pathetic. It is a reality, and a stern\r\nreality, that can hardly be imitated or duplicated by any other two men\r\nin this generation. The thing is possible, but just about as probable as\r\nit was for every private soldier of Napoleon the Great, who each had a\r\nMarshal’s baton in his knapsack, to become a Marshal. “Every\r\nblacksmith,” says the Rev. Robert Collyer, “might become a preacher, but\r\nit would be a great public calamity if it should happen to that extent.”\r\nThe bare outlines of the Vanderbilt wills, which have made such a deep\r\nimpression on the community at large, will be found in another part of\r\nthis book. I think they will afford very interesting reading for\r\ngenerations yet unborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _W H Vanderbilt_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n            WILLIAM H.

Vanderbilt, especially in its\r\nrelation to Wall Street affairs and the management of his great railroad\r\nsystem, the two being closely connected. William H. Vanderbilt was not\r\nmuch of a speculator in the Wall Street sense of the term. He was more\r\nof an investor than a speculator, and his investments had always a\r\nhealthy effect upon the market. Unlike Woerishoffer and others of that\r\nilk, he built up instead of pulling down values, but was at the same\r\ntime careful to avoid the error of inflation. He paid due deference to\r\npublic opinion also, in striving to allay its alarm in regard to the\r\ndangerous overgrowth of monopolies. A grand illustration of this was\r\nseen in the sale of the large block of New York Central. His first\r\nexperience in railroad matters was in connection with the Staten Island\r\nRailroad, thirteen miles in length. The road had been mismanaged and was\r\ndeeply in debt, and became bankrupt. As he and his father had\r\nconsiderable interest in the road William H. was appointed receiver. It\r\nseems this was done secretly at the suggestion of the Commodore, who\r\nwanted to discover by this experiment if his son had any capacity for\r\nrailroad management. The receivership of the Staten Island road was\r\ncrowned with signal success. In two years the entire indebtedness of the\r\nroad was paid, and the stock, which had been worthless, rose to 175.\r\nWilliam H. Vanderbilt was then elected President of the road. It was at\r\nthis time, it is said, that the Commodore began to correct his judgment\r\nregarding the “executive ability of William H.,” and the latter relaxed\r\nno effort to please his exacting father in everything, taking all his\r\nabuse without complaint or anger. After the Commodore secured control of\r\nthe Harlem road, which was his first great railroad venture, he made\r\nWilliam H. Vice-President. As a co-worker with his father the latter\r\nfurther demonstrated his capacity for railroad management, and Harlem\r\nstock, which had been down to nearly nothing, in a few years became one\r\nof the most valuable railroad properties in the country. So, it is a\r\nfact, although not generally known, that William H. Vanderbilt had\r\nproved himself to be a competent railroad manager before his eminent\r\nfather had fairly begun that line of business. It was almost entirely\r\nowing to his individual exertions and sound judgment that, in a few\r\nyears, the Harlem road was double-tracked, and such other improvements\r\nmade as sent the stock from 8 or 9 to above par. The Commodore was so\r\nhighly pleased and agreeably surprised with his son’s management of the\r\nHarlem road that he made him Vice-President of the Hudson River Railroad\r\nalso, and at a later date associated him in the same capacity with the\r\nmanagement of the important consolidation of New York Central & Hudson\r\nRiver. The great executive power of William H. was manifested in every\r\nsuccessive movement which his father directed, and unparalleled\r\nprosperity was the result in every instance. After William H. was fully\r\ninstalled in the Vice-Presidency of the consolidated system of the\r\nVanderbilt railroads he became an indefatigable worker, taxing his\r\nphysical and mental powers to their utmost capacity, and it was\r\ndoubtless this habit of hard work, persisted in for many years, that\r\nresulted in so sudden and comparatively premature death for a member of\r\na family famous for its longevity throughout several generations. He\r\ninsisted on making himself familiar with the smallest details of every\r\ndepartment, and examined everything personally. He carefully scrutinized\r\nevery bill, check and voucher connected with the financial department of\r\nthe immense railroad system, and inspected every engine belonging to the\r\nnumerous trains of the roads. In addition to this general supervision of\r\neverything that pertained to the railroads, he was in the habit of going\r\nover a large amount of correspondence which the majority of other men\r\nnot possessing the hundredth part of his wealth hand over to their\r\nclerks, and he answered a great number of letters with his own hand\r\nwhich financiers of comparatively moderate means are in the habit of\r\ndictating to their stenographers. When his father died, at the age of\r\n82, in January, 1887, William H. Vanderbilt, then 56 years of age, found\r\nhimself the happy possessor of a fortune variously estimated at from 75\r\nto 90 million dollars. The remainder of the Commodore’s bequests\r\namounted to 15 millions.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father the executive powers of Wm. H. Vanderbilt,\r\nin the management of the vast railroad interests bequeathed to him, were\r\ncalled into active play. The great strike of 1877 among the railroad\r\nemployes threatened to paralyze business all over the country, and came\r\npretty near causing a social revolution. In this emergency a cool head\r\nand prudent judgment were valuable attributes to a railroad manager. Mr.\r\nVanderbilt proved that he possessed both in more than an ordinary\r\ndegree. Just prior to encountering the knotty problem of the strike he\r\nhad been highly instrumental in bringing about suspension of hostilities\r\nin the freight war, and the course which he advised led to an\r\narrangement that produced harmony among the trunk lines for a\r\nconsiderable period. As a consequence of the rate war the railroad\r\ncompanies were obliged to cut down the wages of their employes, and this\r\nwas the chief element in causing the strike. There were 12,000 men in\r\nthe employ of the New York Central and Harlem. Their wages had been\r\nreduced ten per cent. and they had threatened to annihilate the Grand\r\nCentral Depot. Instead of making application to have the militia called\r\nout, as had been done in Pennsylvania, Mr. Vanderbilt—although a man\r\npossessed of far more than ordinary courage—with keen foresight proposed\r\na kindly compromise with his employes. He telegraphed from Saratoga to\r\nhis head officials an order to distribute $100,000 among his striking\r\nemployes and promising them a restoration of the ten per cent. reduction\r\nas soon as business improved to a point justifying such an advance. This\r\nprompt and prudent action had the desired effect, and the consequence\r\nwas that while there was a small insurrection in Pittsburgh, and bloody\r\nwar to the knife, at great cost to Allegheny County, calmness reigned in\r\nthe prominent railroad circles of New York, and the taxpayers escaped\r\nthe burden that might otherwise have been put upon their shoulders, and\r\nthe demoralizing effects of violence and bloodshed were prevented. Over\r\n11,500 of the 12,000 men returned to work, thus showing their gratitude\r\nto Mr. Vanderbilt and faith in his promise, which was afterwards duly\r\nfulfilled. The policy of Wm. H., in the management of his great railroad\r\nsystem, unlike that of his father, was entirely pacific in its\r\ncharacter. He was disposed to settle all misunderstandings by reason and\r\narbitration, and had no inclination for fighting and conquest, after the\r\nmanner of the Commodore. Although a very close calculator in business\r\nmatters, a habit to which he adhered even to the precision of striking\r\nout superfluous items which should not have been charged in his lunch\r\nbill, Mr. Vanderbilt was in many respects generous to a fault. He\r\ncompromised the suit with his brother, “Young Corneel,” allowing him the\r\ninterest on $1,000,000, whereas his father had only left him the\r\ninterest on $200,000, with a forfeiture clause in the event of “Corneel”\r\ncontesting the will. Wm. H. also made a present of $500,000 in United\r\nStates bonds to each of his sisters, out of his own private fortune. A\r\ngood story is related in connection with the distribution of this\r\nhandsome gift. Mr. Vanderbilt, it is said, went around one evening in\r\nhis carriage, taking the bonds with him and dispensing them to the\r\nfortunate recipients from his own hands. One of his brothers-in-law\r\nhaving observed by the evening papers that the bond market had declined\r\na point or two on that day, said, “William, these bonds fall $150 short\r\nof the $500,000, according to the closing prices of this day’s market.”\r\n“All right,” replied Mr. Vanderbilt, with assumed gravity, “I will give\r\nyou a check for the balance,” and he wrote and signed it on the spot. It\r\nis related that another brother-in-law followed him to the door, and\r\nsaid, “If there is to be anything more in this line I hope we shall not\r\nbe forgotten.” It is said that these remarkable instances of\r\ningratitude, instead of irritating him, as they would have in the case\r\nof an ordinary individual, only served to arouse his risible faculties\r\nand that he regarded the exhibitions of human weakness as a good joke.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest works of Mr. Vanderbilt’s life was the building of\r\nthe beautiful palace on Fifth avenue, between Fifty-first and\r\nFifty-second streets, which he adorned extensively with paintings\r\nselected from the great masterpieces of the most renowned artists of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOne reason assigned for his disinclination to speculate was that he\r\nregarded the property left by his father in the light of a sacred trust,\r\nand while he considered it a filial duty to look after its increase and\r\naccumulation, he was careful not to do anything that might risk its\r\ndissipation.\r\n\r\nMr. Chauncey Depew, who succeeded to the presidency of the New York\r\nCentral & Hudson River Railroad Company, was upon one occasion, while\r\nvisiting in London, a guest at a dinner given to the Hon. Wm. E.\r\nGladstone, then Premier of England, and was honored by a seat on the\r\nleft of Mr. Gladstone, with whom he discussed the differences between\r\nAmerican and English railroad and financial management. In the course of\r\nconversation Mr. Gladstone said, “I understand you have a man in your\r\ncountry who is worth £20,000,000 or $100,000,000, and it is all in\r\nproperty which he can convert at will into cash. The Government ought to\r\nseize his property and take it away from him, as it is too dangerous a\r\npower for any one man to have. Supposing he should convert his property\r\ninto money and lock it up, it would make a panic in America which would\r\nextend to this country and every other part of the world, and be a great\r\ninjury to a large number of innocent people.” Mr. Depew admitted that\r\nthe gentleman referred to—who was Mr. Vanderbilt—had fully the amount of\r\nmoney named and more, and in his usual suave and conclusive way,\r\nreplied, “But you have, Mr. Gladstone, a man in England who has equally\r\nas large a fortune.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said, “I suppose you mean the Duke of Westminster. The\r\nDuke of Westminster’s property is not as large as that. I know all about\r\nhis property and have kept pace with it for many years past. The Duke’s\r\nproperty is worth about £10,000,000 or $50,000,000, but it is not in\r\nsecurities which can be turned into ready cash and thereby absorb the\r\ncurrent money of the country, so that he can make any dangerous use of\r\nit, for it is merely an hereditary right, the enjoyment of it that he\r\npossesses. It is inalienable, and it is so with all great fortunes in\r\nthis country, and thus, I think, we are better protected here in England\r\nthan you are in America.” “Ah, but like you in England, we in America do\r\nnot consider a fortune dangerous,” was the ready response.\r\n\r\nThe best proof of Wm. H. Vanderbilt’s great ability as a financier is\r\nthe marvellous increase in the value of the estate which he inherited\r\nfrom his father during the seven years which he had the use and control\r\nof it, and in which he did more than treble the value at which it was\r\nestimated on the death of the Commodore.\r\n\r\nThe weakest financial operation on his part, known to the public, was\r\nthe purchase of the Nickel Plate Road, as regards the time of the\r\ntransaction, in which he was rather premature. It is now positively\r\nknown that if he had waited about a month longer the road would have\r\ngone into bankruptcy and have fallen into his lap on his own terms. In\r\nthat case the West Shore would have followed suit.\r\n\r\nIn such an event I believe Mr. Vanderbilt would have been saved an\r\nimmense amount of money, remorse and mental strain, which, no doubt,\r\naggravated the malady which was the cause of his sudden death. He\r\nrealized his error when it was too late, and it was a source of great\r\nmental anxiety to him in his latter days. He was very sensitive, and\r\nnothing afforded him more gratification than a clean and successful\r\ntransaction, which drew forth public approval, and in the purchase of\r\nNickel Plate he was caught napping. It was a mistake for which the\r\nCommodore, had he been alive, could never have forgiven him.\r\n\r\nThe syndicate that built the road had solely for their object to land it\r\nupon either Gould or Vanderbilt, and it was upon its last legs at the\r\ntime it made the transfer to Mr. Vanderbilt. The syndicate laid a trap\r\nfor him. It had been coquetting with Mr. Gould in reference to the\r\npurchase, and had made it to appear, through the press and other\r\nchannels of plausible rumors, that he had an eye upon the road. Mr.\r\nGould had occasion to go West about this time and the syndicate invited\r\nhim to make his homeward trip over the road, taking particular pains\r\nthat all these rumors and reports should reach the ears of Mr.\r\nVanderbilt, who was impressed with the idea that Mr. Gould’s trip was\r\none of inspection, with the intention of buying the road if he did not\r\nanticipate him. This was just what the syndicate desired, and the\r\nsuccessful consummation of their financial plot.\r\n\r\nThe purchase was made solely in the interest of Lake Shore, as it was a\r\nparallel road, and the road was afterwards turned over to the Lake Shore\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe conception of the scheme was to build the road at a nominal price\r\nand sell it to Mr. Vanderbilt as high as possible, and this was duly\r\naccomplished. I am quite satisfied that if this road had not been sold\r\nat this particular time it would then have gone into the hands of a\r\nreceiver, while a number of the syndicate, who had built the road, would\r\nhave failed, and a general crash would have ensued. This Mr.\r\nVanderbilt’s purchase averted for the time, and served to prolong the\r\nperiod of its coming until May, 1884.\r\n\r\nFor a few years prior to his death Mr. Vanderbilt was in a weak\r\ncondition. This cause of mental annoyance came upon him at a time when\r\nhe was not robust enough to bear it and had not sufficient strength to\r\nthrow it off. He had been seized with a slight paralytic stroke, the\r\nonly visible effect of which was a twitching of the lower lip. Shortly\r\nafter this he lost the entire sight of one eye, about a year before his\r\ndeath. This was not generally known to the public, however, and it was\r\nthe principal cause of his giving up his favorite pastime of driving,\r\nwhich was one of his greatest pleasures and the chief source of mental\r\ndiversion from the heavy weight of his worldly cares and\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe day after Mr. Vanderbilt’s death I sent the following circular to my\r\ncustomers:\r\n\r\n    “As Mr. Wm. H. Vanderbilt was a very important factor in Wall\r\n    Street business, I feel it incumbent upon me to issue a letter\r\n    to my friends and clients on the subject of his decease,\r\n    especially as the loss to the Street is a most important one,\r\n    and certainly will be felt for some time to come. Mr. Vanderbilt\r\n    undoubtedly, at the time of his death, was the largest holder of\r\n    American securities in the world, and had innumerable followers,\r\n    who were also vast holders of similar properties as those he\r\n    controlled, who acted more or less in concert with him, and who\r\n    were at his beck and call. When he told them to buy or sell they\r\n    would do so. These parties have now lost a valuable friend and\r\n    counsellor, and a leader in whom they believed implicitly. In\r\n    such quarters, for some time to come at least, more or less of a\r\n    dazed condition will prevail, precisely, the same as would exist\r\n    in an army in the event of the general in command having been\r\n    killed. Mr. Vanderbilt was a bolder and larger operator than his\r\n    father ever dared to be, as he spread out over more interests.\r\n    The market has lost an able leader, who was usually a builder-up\r\n    of the interests of the entire country, and unlike many other\r\n    large operators, who, at times, are on that side, but quite as\r\n    frequently on the wrecking side. It will be a long while before\r\n    so conspicuous and valiant a leader as Mr. Wm. H. Vanderbilt\r\n    will be forthcoming, and the market will, for a protracted\r\n    period, have cause to mourn its great loss. It is, indeed,\r\n    fortunate that Mr. Vanderbilt lived long enough to see the\r\n    completion of the consolidation of the West Shore and New York\r\n    Central roads; since both roads are under the able direction of\r\n    Mr. Depew, they are now secure from future harm; but the same\r\n    cannot be said of the South Pennsylvania enterprise, as\r\n    negotiations remain in connection therewith unfinished, which\r\n    will suffer by Mr. Vanderbilt’s death, and it will be found\r\n    difficult, I fear, for any other man to knit the discordant\r\n    elements together that at present exist in that quarter. There\r\n    is enough in this for some ground of apprehension, and this\r\n    matter may, therefore, disturb the harmony of the great trunk\r\n    lines, as this speck of trouble may yet prove a cancer in the\r\n    body of the stock market. As it is capable of infusing its\r\n    poison elsewhere, beyond where it is at present located, it is\r\n    certain that there will be required skillful surgery to prevent\r\n    inoculation therefrom.\r\n\r\n    “The stock market started off to-day as if held by concerted\r\n    action, and the appearances indicating that such attitude might\r\n    prevail to bridge over the Vanderbilt shock. While prices had a\r\n    moderate break, it was scarcely adequate as a fitting tribute of\r\n    respect to Mr. Vanderbilt’s memory, as the great General of the\r\n    Army of Finance of this country. It was unmistakable, however,\r\n    that the large selling was mostly of long stock, coming from\r\n    numerous frightened holders who were shaken out, and it was very\r\n    evident that the bears were more conspicuous as buyers than as\r\n    sellers, to cover their short sales made during the previous\r\n    several days. I do not think that the market had, considering\r\n    the power it has lost in the death of Mr. Vanderbilt, as much of\r\n    a break as should have occurred; still, it must be remembered,\r\n    that the dealings have been so enormous during the past month,\r\n    which represent the immense number of operators now interested\r\n    in the market, that it has taken from it a character which\r\n    previously existed as a one man market, and therefore it is\r\n    owing to this fact that the removal of any one man, or a half\r\n    dozen of them, by death or otherwise, could not bring about, at\r\n    the present time, any very wide and lasting disaster to Wall\r\n    Street. This market, as I have repeatedly stated, can fairly be\r\n    now considered the market for the world, and beyond the\r\n    permanent reach of any one man doing it any lasting harm. As Mr.\r\n    Vanderbilt invented pegging stocks, and stood his ground when\r\n    taken better than any one that will survive him in that plan of\r\n    strategic movement, he will, in that particular alone, be\r\n    sorrowfully missed. I am of the opinion, now that Mr. Vanderbilt\r\n    is no more, that Mr. Gould’s plan of leaving the Street will\r\n    undergo a modification, at least by his remaining for some time\r\n    longer at the helm. This will prove, in such an event, an\r\n    important factor in the future, especially as the bulls of the\r\n    Street have for at least a year past recognized Mr. Gould in the\r\n    light of a benefactor. To them he has proved a brave and able\r\n    leader, and the field is now clear for him to become\r\n    commander-in-chief of all the forces, without any one to dispute\r\n    his right thereto. This should be enough to fire his ambition\r\n    and keep him in our midst, and probably will.”\r\n\r\n    Among the popular and erroneous impressions entertained\r\n    regarding Wm. H. Vanderbilt, the one that he was no judge of\r\n    pictures seemed to have taken deep root in the public mind,\r\n    except among the few who knew him intimately, and the celebrated\r\n    artists whom he visited and from whom he purchased many of the\r\n    works of art which adorn his great gallery in Fifth avenue, now\r\n    in charge of his youngest son, George. That Mr. Vanderbilt had\r\n    an intimate knowledge and correct appreciation of true art has\r\n    been amply proved by the highest authority. I am well aware that\r\n    some years ago this statement would have been ridiculed by the\r\n    majority of the newspapers; but Mr. Vanderbilt never bought a\r\n    picture that he did not fully understand in his own simple,\r\n    unaffected method of judgment. He may not have been capable of\r\n    the highest flights of fancy, necessary to follow the poetic\r\n    imagination of the artist to its extreme height, but he was\r\n    equal to the task of grasping all the material essentials from a\r\n    common-sense point of view.\r\n\r\n    So far from making any pretence of being a lover of art, he was\r\n    in the habit of saying, when a handsome painting was shown him,\r\n    “It may be very fine, but until I can appreciate its beauty I\r\n    shall not buy it.”\r\n\r\n    Apropos of his modesty and judgment, in regard to the fidelity\r\n    to nature of a picture, a circumstance is related of his visit\r\n    to Boucheron, a French picture dealer, where he wanted to see a\r\n    painting by Troyon, with the object of buying it. A yoke of oxen\r\n    turning from the plough to leave the field is the subject.\r\n    Experts in art had taken exception to the manner in which the\r\n    cattle left the field. When Mr. Vanderbilt’s opinion was asked,\r\n    he said, “I don’t know as much about the quality of the picture\r\n    as I do about the truth of the actions of the cattle. I have\r\n    seen them act like that hundreds of times.” The artists present\r\n    submitted to his judgment, as he knew more about the oxen than\r\n    they did. When in France he visited the celebrated Rosa Bonheur,\r\n    at Fontainebleau, who was about his own age, and gave her an\r\n    order for two pictures, which she painted to his entire\r\n    satisfaction. He had his portrait painted by the celebrated\r\n    Meissonier, to whom he paid nearly $200,000 for seven pictures.\r\n    He purchased in Germany this artist’s masterpiece, “The\r\n    Information—General Desaix and the Captured Peasant,” for\r\n    $40,000, giving Meissonier, who had not seen it for many years,\r\n    a great surprise, and filling the heart of the enthusiastic\r\n    artist with unbounded gratitude for rescuing the picture from\r\n    Germany and bringing it to America.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Vanderbilt’s taste for music, especially operatic music, was\r\n    refined, and he had a keen sense of the humorous.\r\n\r\n    Neither Mr. Vanderbilt nor any of his family ever displayed any\r\n    anxiety to hobnob with those people who are known as the leaders\r\n    of society, although possessed of more wealth than the greatest\r\n    of them. The celebrated fancy dress ball, given by Mrs. Wm. K.\r\n    Vanderbilt, at the suggestion of Lady Mandeville, in March,\r\n    1883, seemed to have the effect of levelling up among the social\r\n    ranks of upper-tendom, and placing the Vanderbilts at the top of\r\n    the heap, in what is recognized as good society in New York. So\r\n    far as cost, richness of costume and newspaper celebrity were\r\n    concerned, that ball had, perhaps, no equal in history. It may\r\n    not have been quite so expensive as the feast of Alexander the\r\n    Great at Babylon, some of the entertainments of Cleopatra to\r\n    Augustus and Mark Antony, or a few of the magnificent banquets\r\n    of Louis XIV., but when viewed from every essential standpoint,\r\n    and taking into account our advanced civilization, I have no\r\n    hesitation in saying that the Vanderbilt ball was superior to\r\n    any of those grand historic displays of festivity and amusement\r\n    referred to, and more especially as the pleasure was not cloyed\r\n    with any excesses like those prevalent with the ancient nobility\r\n    of the old world and frequently exhibited among the modern “salt\r\n    of the earth” in the mother country. The ball had the effect of\r\n    drawing the Astors and the Vanderbilts into social union. The\r\n    _entente cordiale_ was brought about in this way, as the story\r\n    goes:\r\n\r\n    Several weeks before the ball Miss Carrie Astor, daughter of\r\n    Mrs. William Astor, organized a fancy dress quadrille, to be\r\n    danced at the ball. Mrs. Vanderbilt, it seems, heard of this and\r\n    said, in the hearing of some friends, that she was sorry Miss\r\n    Astor was putting herself to so much trouble, as she could not\r\n    invite her to the ball, for the reason that Mrs. Astor had never\r\n    called on her. This was carried to Mrs. Astor, who immediately\r\n    unbent her stateliness, called on Mrs. Vanderbilt, and in a very\r\n    ladylike manner made the _amende honorable_ for her former\r\n    neglect. So the Astors were cordially invited to the ball, where\r\n    Miss Astor presented a superb appearance with her well trained\r\n    quadrille.\r\n\r\n    All Mr. Vanderbilt’s other attachments vanished in presence of\r\n    his love for his horses. When any company, of which he formed a\r\n    part, began to talk horse his tongue was immediately loosened\r\n    and he became eloquent. Although generally a man of few words\r\n    and diffident as a talker, he could throw the eloquence of\r\n    Chauncey M. Depew in the shade when the subject was horse. He\r\n    not alone admired the speed of his horses; he seemed possessed\r\n    of the fondness of an Arabian for them, and, like old John\r\n    Harper of Kentucky, would probably have slept with them only\r\n    through fear of the newspapers criticising his eccentricity. It\r\n    was he who introduced the custom of fast driving teams, first\r\n    with Small Hopes, purchased by his father, and Lady Mac,\r\n    purchased by himself. With this team, in a top road wagon, he\r\n    made the then remarkable time of 2.23¼.\r\n\r\n    A host of rivals immediately sprang up, of whom Mr. Frank Work\r\n    was the most formidable. Mr. Vanderbilt procured faster teams,\r\n    and with Aldine and Early Rose, under the spur of competition,\r\n    reduced the time to 2.16½. Mr. Work, however, was a daring and\r\n    persistent rival, and soon beat this record, although only by a\r\n    fraction of a minute, which in trotting or racing counts just\r\n    the same as if it were an hour. Mr. Vanderbilt then purchased\r\n    the famous Maud S. in Kentucky for $21,000, and with her and\r\n    Aldine made the mile in Fleetwood Park in June, 1883, in 2.15½.\r\n\r\n    He afterwards reduced this time to 2.08¾, leaving Mr. Work and\r\n    all other rivals hopelessly in the distance. Eventually he sold\r\n    Maud S. to Mr. Robert Bonner for the comparatively small amount\r\n    of $40,000, on condition that she should never be trotted for\r\n    money. Other men would have given $100,000 for her without this\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\n    On the 12th of August, this year, Murphy, the famous jockey,\r\n    drove Maud S. in single harness, at Tarrytown, a mile in 2.10½,\r\n    and declared he did not push her. He said he was confident he\r\n    could make her do the mile in 2.06 or 2.07 if Mr. Bonner would\r\n    permit him, thus smashing all trotting records.\r\n\r\n    It has been said by experts in driving that Mr. Vanderbilt was\r\n    the best double-team driver in America, either amateur or\r\n    professional.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Vanderbilt’s bequests were liberal and numerous. He added\r\n    $300,000 to the million which his father gave, through the wife\r\n    of the Commodore and Dr. Deems, to the Nashville University. He\r\n    gave half a million to the College of Physicians and Surgeons,\r\n    and his sister, Mrs. Sloane, added a quarter of a million to\r\n    this generous donation. It cost him over $100,000 to remove\r\n    Cleopatra’s Needle from Egypt to Central Park. He offered to\r\n    cancel the $150,000 check which he gave to General Grant to\r\n    relieve him from the Ward-Fish embarrassment, and his munificent\r\n    gift to the waiter students in the White Mountains will long be\r\n    remembered.\r\n\r\n    Although Mr. Vanderbilt was very courageous, as was proved by\r\n    the fact that no matter how many threatening letters he may have\r\n    received—and their name was legion—from cranks, socialists and\r\n    others, he never made any change in his programme or his routine\r\n    of business for the day, and never absented himself from the\r\n    place where he was expected at any particular hour on account of\r\n    such letters. Yet he was peculiarly sensitive to public opinion,\r\n    and sought in various ways to correct its hasty judgment in\r\n    regard to himself and his enormous wealth.\r\n\r\n    It was this sensitive feeling, together with his profound\r\n    respect for popular opinion against monopolies, which induced\r\n    him to sell a controlling interest, 300,000 shares out of\r\n    400,000, at from 120 to 130, ten points below the market price,\r\n    of New York Central stock in 1879 to a syndicate, the chief\r\n    members of which were Drexel, Morgan & Co., Morton, Bliss & Co.,\r\n    August Belmont & Co., Winslow, Lanier & Co., L. Von Hoffman &\r\n    Co, Cyrus W. Field, Edwin D. Morgan, Russell Sage, Jay Gould and\r\n    J. S. Morgan & Co. of London. The amount paid for the stock was\r\n    $35,000,000. As the syndicate largely represented the Wabash\r\n    system, the stock of that property, as well as New York Central,\r\n    had an important advance.\r\n\r\n    The reasons assigned for this stupendous and unprecedented stock\r\n    transaction are briefly condensed by Mr. Chauncey M. Depew as\r\n    follows: “Mr. Vanderbilt, because of assaults made upon him in\r\n    the Legislature and in the newspapers, came to the conclusion\r\n    that it was a mistake for one individual to own a controlling\r\n    interest in a great corporation like the New York Central, and\r\n    also a mistake to have so many eggs in one basket, and he\r\n    thought it would be better for himself and better for the\r\n    company if the ownership were distributed as widely as possible.\r\n    The syndicate afterwards sold it, and the stock became one of\r\n    the most widely-distributed of the dividend-paying American\r\n    securities. There are now about 14,000 stockholders. At the time\r\n    he sold there were only 3,000.”\r\n\r\n    That hasty expression, “The public be damned,” which Mr.\r\n    Vanderbilt used in an interview with a reporter for a Chicago\r\n    newspaper, has received wide circulation, various comment and\r\n    hostile criticism. Although the expression is literally correct,\r\n    the public at first, and many of them to this day, received a\r\n    wrong impression in regard to the spirit in which it was\r\n    applied. It was represented as if Mr. Vanderbilt was a\r\n    tyrannical monopolist, who defied public opinion. A true and\r\n    simple relation of the interview is a sufficient answer to this.\r\n    The subject was the fast mail train to Chicago. Mr. Vanderbilt\r\n    was thinking of taking this train off, because it did not pay,\r\n    and did not appear to him therefore to be a necessity, and he\r\n    did not propose to run trains as a philanthropist. As part of\r\n    the interview which relates to this point has become so widely\r\n    historic, I think it will bear reproduction here, literally:\r\n\r\n    “Why are you going to stop this fast mail train?” asked the\r\n    reporter.\r\n\r\n    “Because it doesn’t pay,” replied Mr. Vanderbilt; “I can’t run a\r\n    train as far as this permanently at a loss.”\r\n\r\n    “But the public find it very convenient and useful. You ought to\r\n    accommodate them,” rejoined the reporter.\r\n\r\n    “The public,” said Mr. Vanderbilt. “How do you know, or how can\r\n    I know that they want it? If they want it why don’t they\r\n    patronize it and make it pay? That’s the only test I have as to\r\n    whether a thing is wanted or not. Does it pay? If it doesn’t pay\r\n    I suppose it isn’t wanted.”\r\n\r\n    “Are you working,” persisted the reporter, “for the public or\r\n    for your stockholders?”\r\n\r\n    “The public be damned!” exclaimed Mr. Vanderbilt, “I am working\r\n    for my stockholders. If the public want the train why don’t they\r\n    support it.”\r\n\r\n    This, I think, was a very proper answer from a business\r\n    standpoint, and the expression, when placed in its real\r\n    connection in the interview, does not imply any slur upon the\r\n    public. It simply intimates that he was urging a thing on the\r\n    public which it did not want and practically refused. The\r\n    “cuss” word might have been left out, but the crushing reply\r\n    to the reporter would not have been so emphatic, and that\r\n    obtrusive representative of public opinion might have gone\r\n    away unsquelched. As it was, however, he and his editor\r\n    exhibited considerable ingenuity in making the best\r\n    misrepresentation possible out of the words of Mr. Vanderbilt,\r\n    thus giving them a thousand times wider circulation than the\r\n    journal in which they were first printed, and affording that\r\n    paper a big advertisement. This is the correct account of that\r\n    world-renowned expression, “The public be damned!”\r\n\r\n    The mausoleum at New Dorp, Staten Island, is another outcome of\r\n    the genius of Wm. H. Vanderbilt. Mr. Richard M. Hunt was the\r\n    architect. Pursuant to the instructions of Mr. Vanderbilt, it\r\n    was built without any fancy work, but at the same time on such a\r\n    grand and substantial scale that it is said there is nothing\r\n    among the tombs of either European or Oriental royalty to excel\r\n    it, in solidity of structure and grandeur of design. It is forty\r\n    feet in height, sixty in breadth and about 150 in depth. It is\r\n    situated on an eminence commanding the largest prospect of the\r\n    bay, and one of the finest views all around in the State of New\r\n    York. The tomb and the twenty-one acres of land, upon the\r\n    highest part of which it stands, cost nearly half a million\r\n    dollars, and when the grounds are finished, in the style\r\n    intended, beautiful roads and walks made, flower gardens planted\r\n    with the requisite adornments, the entire expense of the\r\n    mausoleum and its surroundings will not fall far short of a\r\n    million dollars.\r\n\r\n    The precautions taken by the family against resurrectionists is\r\n    one of the best that has ever been adopted. There is a guard at\r\n    the tomb night and day. Each of these must put on record his\r\n    vigilance every fifteen minutes by winding up a clock, which is\r\n    sent to the office at the Grand Central Depot every morning.\r\n\r\n    In May, 1883, Mr. Vanderbilt, finding that his railroad duties\r\n    were too heavy for him, resigned the presidencies of his roads\r\n    and took a trip to Europe. James H. Rutter was elected President\r\n    of the Central, and on his death was succeeded by Chauncey M.\r\n    Depew, the present President, who so ably fills that office.\r\n    About a year before his death Mr. Vanderbilt gave unmistakable\r\n    notice of his approaching dissolution when he stopped driving\r\n    his fast teams, and went out riding with some other person to\r\n    drive for him. He must have keenly felt his growing weakness\r\n    when he was obliged to resign the reins which he so fondly\r\n    desired to hold, and which he had handled with such inimitable\r\n    skill.\r\n\r\n    The death of Mr. Vanderbilt was a great surprise, especially to\r\n    Wall Street, as very few brokers were aware even of his failing\r\n    health. On the 8th day of December, 1885, he arose early,\r\n    apparently no worse in health than he had been for a year\r\n    previous. He went to the studio of J. Q. A. Ward and gave that\r\n    artist a sitting for the bronze bust ordered by the Trustees of\r\n    the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Mr. Depew called upon\r\n    him at one o’clock, but finding that Mr. Robert Garrett,\r\n    President of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had also\r\n    called to see Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Depew waived his opportunity\r\n    in favor of Mr. Garrett. Mr. Garrett was conversing on his\r\n    project of getting into New York by way of Staten Island and a\r\n    bridge over the Arthur Kill. They were in the study. Mr.\r\n    Vanderbilt sat in his large arm chair and Mr. Garrett sat on a\r\n    sofa opposite to him. It seems that Mr. Vanderbilt was in\r\n    perfect harmony with the plans of Mr. Garrett. While he was\r\n    replying to the remarks of Mr. Garrett the latter observed that\r\n    his voice began to falter and there was a curious twitching of\r\n    the muscles about his mouth. Soon he ceased to speak and had a\r\n    spasm. In a moment he leaned forward and would have fallen on\r\n    his face on the floor, but Mr. Garrett caught him in his arms,\r\n    laid him gently on the rug and put a pillow under his head. This\r\n    was only the work of a few moments, but before it was\r\n    accomplished the greatest millionaire in America had ceased to\r\n    breathe. When Dr. McLean, the family physician, arrived he said\r\n    a blood vessel had burst in the head, and so death, according to\r\n    the frequently expressed wish of Mr. Vanderbilt, was\r\n    instantaneous.\r\n\r\n    On the announcement of Mr. Vanderbilt’s death, (which was after\r\n    Board hours), a panic was predicted in the stock market. A pool\r\n    was formed of the most wealthy leading operators, with a capital\r\n    of $12,000,000, to resist such a calamity. It was not required,\r\n    however. There was a reaction of a few points in the morning\r\n    following, which was recovered before the close of the market.\r\n    The stocks of Mr. Vanderbilt’s properties, as well as the\r\n    properties themselves, had been so well distributed that such a\r\n    disaster could hardly have occurred without a strong outside\r\n    combination to help it, and the prevalent desire there was to\r\n    assist speculation in the very opposite direction. The remains\r\n    of Mr. Vanderbilt were conveyed to New Dorp and deposited in the\r\n    tomb without any ostentation.\r\n\r\n    In the chapter on the young Vanderbilts a brief account of the\r\n    disposition of the mammoth fortune of $200,000,000 is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n               “YOUNG CORNEEL.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ECCENTRICITIES OF CORNELIUS JEREMIAH VANDERBILT, AND HIS MARVELLOUS\r\n    POWER FOR BORROWING MONEY.—HE EXERCISES WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER\r\n    GREELEY AND COLFAX.—A DINNER AT THE CLUB WITH YOUNG “CORNEEL” AND\r\n    THE “FAMOUS SMILER.”—“CORNEEL TRIES TO MAKE HIMSELF SOLID WITH JAY\r\n    COOKE.—THE COMMODORE REFUSES TO PAY GREELEY.-“WHO THE DEVIL ASKED\r\n    YOU?” RETORTED GREELEY.-“CORNEEL’S” MARRIAGE TO A CHARMING AND\r\n    DEVOTED WOMAN.—HOW SHE SOFTENED THE OBDURATE HEART OF HER\r\n    FATHER-IN-LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nCornelius J. Vanderbilt, the brother of Wm. H., popularly known by the\r\nname of “Young Corneel,” is entitled to a place in this book, as he was\r\nprominent among the many financial friends I have had, in his own\r\npeculiar line.\r\n\r\n“Corneel” was eccentric, and was possessed of some astonishing\r\npeculiarities that made him a genius in his way. He led a charmed and\r\nadventurous life in his own circles.\r\n\r\nHe had a wonderful facility for getting into scrapes, and “banked” on\r\nthe Commodore to extricate him therefrom, which the latter did on many\r\noccasions. The mere fact, however, that he had such a father, was in\r\nitself sufficient, very often, to get him out of his troubles, without\r\nany effort on the part of the Commodore in that direction. “Corneel,”\r\nhowever, worked this “racket” for all it was worth, and in time it\r\nbecame almost exhausted. Still, he went on making new acquaintances\r\nwithout limit, and to many of them the name of the Commodore was a\r\nsufficient guarantee of security for sundry loans, that were promised to\r\nbe paid on the fulfilment of certain expectations which only existed in\r\nthe borrower’s imagination.\r\n\r\nBut it was not very safe for “Corneel” to rely upon his father, or to\r\nbank upon his credit in any case. If he had depended solely on the\r\npaternal security, he would often have found, when in his worst straits,\r\nthat he had leaned upon a willow cane for support. “Corneel” had a\r\npeculiar fascination in his ability to catch the ear of prominent men,\r\nwho would listen attentively to his tale of woe, and some of them were\r\nso thoroughly under the spell of his persuasive powers that they would\r\n“fork” out the required amount without hesitation, to relieve his\r\npressing necessities.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to relate that the money thus sometimes piteously solicited,\r\nand really required to pay a board bill or room rent, was often thrown\r\naway in the first gambling den that the borrower happened to be passing,\r\nwhile the landlady and the washerwoman would be obliged to extend their\r\nbills of credit indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAmongst the special friends upon whom he was in the habit of exercising\r\nhis alluring magnetism were the Hon. Schuyler Colfax and Horace Greeley.\r\nOver both of these eminent gentlemen he seemed to have perfect control.\r\nSo hopelessly were they under the charm of his occult power that they\r\nseldom said “no” to any request that he made, especially when he wanted\r\nto borrow money. No sorcerer ever had his helpless victims more\r\ncompletely at his mercy, nor had greater power by the touch of his\r\nmysterious wand, than “Corneel” had over these and certain other men,\r\nwhen he would entertain them with a list of imaginary wrongs which he\r\nhad suffered at the hands of his father and brother. In their ears this\r\nstory never seemed to become stale, though it was the same old story\r\nevery time, with hardly any attempt at variation. To them and others,\r\nover whom he exercised this unaccountable influence, the thing did not\r\nseem to become monotonous like other twice-told tales, related by\r\nordinary people.\r\n\r\nTo the man of average intellect and common business capacity “Corneel”\r\nwas a shocking “bore” and a victim of morbid melancholia, but these men\r\nof genius were won by the impression which he had made upon them, and\r\nthoroughly imbued with the deepest sympathy for the wrongs which his\r\nstrange hallucinations conjured up. Unlike most men who borrow money\r\nfrom friends and don’t pay, instead of exhausting his credit by this\r\nbusiness delinquency, he made it the basis for increasing it, and it\r\ngenerally seemed to be a potent means of enabling him to borrow more.\r\nHence his obligations to Mr. Greeley were persistently cumulative until\r\nthey exceeded $50,000.\r\n\r\nI have been told by a person familiarly acquainted with him that years\r\nafter Greeley’s death he would sometimes sit in deep meditation, with\r\nthe tears welling up in his eyes, especially when in a great financial\r\nstrait, and sighingly say: “When Mr. Greeley died I lost the best friend\r\nin the world.” Be it said to his credit, however, in spite of all his\r\nshortcomings, he exhibited his honesty by paying every cent of the debt,\r\nwith interest, to Mr. Greeley’s daughters. He also paid the greater part\r\nof all the other debts which he had contracted under similar\r\ncircumstances, after making a settlement with Wm. H. and receiving a\r\nmuch larger amount than he had been left by the will of his father, who\r\nbequeathed him merely a decent competence for his rank and station in\r\nlife, without any surplus for the policy shops and faro banks.\r\n\r\nOne of the qualities possessed by “Corneel” in a remarkable degree, and\r\nwhich enabled him to be so successful a borrower, was his extreme\r\nearnestness. He bent his whole energies to the work in hand, and his\r\nrequests usually met with ready response. If he had put the same energy\r\nand intense enthusiasm into legitimate speculation, he would have been\r\nas successful as his father or Jay Gould. He must have been an intuitive\r\njudge of character, for he showed that he generally knew his man in\r\nadvance of making application for sundry little loans. In that respect\r\nhe was not unlike the famous huntsman who was a dead shot every time.\r\n\r\nMy first acquaintance with “Corneel” was through one of his special\r\nfriends, the Hon. Schuyler Colfax, whom he brought to my office for the\r\npurpose of having himself introduced by Mr. Colfax. He informed me that\r\nhe had just then returned from Hartford, Conn., where he had taken his\r\nfriend, Mr. Colfax, for a week’s visit at his house. It can be readily\r\nimagined, therefore, that at this time Mr. Colfax had but little control\r\nover his own bank account and for a long time afterwards.\r\n\r\nI invited both these gentlemen to dinner at the Club that afternoon.\r\nAlthough Mr. Colfax was an extraordinarily good talker, he was left far\r\nin the distance and almost silenced by “Corneel.” Most of what the\r\nlatter said, however, had very little in it of a tangible character, and\r\nwas almost entirely made up of unstinted praise of his friend Colfax. If\r\never there was a man talked up to the skies, or if the thing were\r\npossible, Colfax must have been literally in that elevated position\r\nduring our dinner.\r\n\r\nThere was no let-up to the unqualified adulation, yet I must say that\r\nthere was none of the uninterrupted stream of fulsome flattery fell to\r\nthe ground. Schuyler took it all in as he did his viands, and as if it\r\nwere legitimately his due, a proof positive that “Young Corneel” was not\r\nmistaken in his man; and a further demonstration of his natural sagacity\r\nin striking the man upon whom he could successfully exercise his\r\npeculiar charms of persuasion.\r\n\r\nWhen he got tired talking about Mr. Colfax, the object of his next theme\r\nwas Mr. Greeley, on whom he was profusely prolific.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Greeley frequently afterwards, and told him what a good friend\r\nhe had in young Cornelius Vanderbilt. “Yes,” he said, with a knowing\r\nsmile, “I think he is a good friend of mine. I have heard of his\r\nfrequently saying nice things about me. It is a great pity, however,” he\r\nadded significantly, “that he is so frequently short of funds. If he had\r\nmore money he would be a very good fellow.”\r\n\r\nIt was generally in the way above referred that he would steal a march\r\non Mr. Greeley and impose on his good nature. He would say nice things\r\nabout him to some one who would quote him to Mr. Greeley, and thus pave\r\nthe way for an additional loan. In a few days afterward “Corneel” would\r\ncall on his tried and trusty friend, and never fail to obtain the needed\r\nrelief, or a large portion of it.\r\n\r\n“Corneel” had great tact in utilizing his various advantages for\r\nborrowing, and was imbued with a thorough devotion to his object, worthy\r\nof a better cause. The day following his first visit to my office, he\r\ncalled again and told me that his friend Colfax had left by the early\r\ntrain for Washington and had urged him to go along, but as he had some\r\nmatters to attend to he had postponed his departure until the night\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nHe said to me, “By-the-bye, you know Jay Cooke very well.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Yes.”\r\n\r\nThen he replied, “I have some matters to look after in connection with\r\nthe Treasury Department, and I think he could be of some service to me.\r\nWill you be good enough to oblige me with a letter of introduction to\r\nhim? I may not need it,” he added with a business air of _sang froid_,\r\n“but I should like to have it in case of need.”\r\n\r\nI wrote him a brief and non-committal introduction, somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n    “This will introduce to you Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., son\r\n    of the Commodore. I take the liberty of making you acquainted\r\n    with him through this medium, at his own request.\r\n\r\n                                  “Truly yours, HENRY CLEWS.”\r\n\r\nThere was certainly nothing on the face of this document, except the\r\nCommodore’s name, to justify any person in utilizing it as a bill of\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nYet the financial genius of “Young Corneel” was equal to the task of an\r\nindirect negotiation of this character, and after the lapse of a few\r\ndays his drafts from Jay Cooke began to pour into my office like April\r\nshowers. None of them was very large, but when put together they\r\naggregated a pretty fair amount, and were so cumulative in their\r\ncharacter that, had I not wired Mr. Cooke to stop the supplies, it is\r\ndifficult to say what figure the sum total would have reached.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw “Young Corneel” was at Long Branch, where he took a\r\ndrive with me one fine warm afternoon. He spoke feelingly about his\r\nwasted life, and concerning the many good friends who had come so often\r\nto his rescue, and had got him out of his numerous holes, into which,\r\nthrough misfortune, he had been thrown. He said all there was of life\r\nfor him was to live long enough to pay up old scores. He had fully\r\ndetermined to do this, and then, he thought, a prolongation of existence\r\nwould have no further charms for him. It must be said to his credit that\r\nhe accomplished this work, and then laying himself sadly down, died by\r\nhis own hand.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, throw the mantle of charity over that tragic scene in\r\nthe Glenham Hotel, and hope that his soul may elsewhere have found the\r\nrest which in its poor, afflicted body it vainly sought for here.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Commodore’s will in which he makes provision for\r\nCornelius J. is thoroughly characteristic of the old man, in its\r\niron-clad provisions. It says: “I direct that $200,000 be set apart, the\r\ninterest thereof to be applied to the maintenance and support of my son,\r\nCornelius J. Vanderbilt, during his natural life. And I authorize said\r\ntrustees, in their discretion, instead of themselves making the\r\napplication of said interest money to his support, to pay over from time\r\nto time, to my said son, for his support, such portions as they may deem\r\nadvisable, or the whole of the interest of said bonds. But no part of\r\nthe interest is to be paid to any assignee of my said son, or to any\r\ncreditor who may seek by legal proceedings to obtain the same; and in\r\ncase my said son should make any transfer or assignment of is beneficial\r\ninterest in said bonds or the interest thereof, or encumber the same, or\r\nattempt so to do, the said interest of said bonds shall thereupon cease\r\nto be applicable to his use, and shall thenceforth, during the residue\r\nof his natural life, belong to my residuary legatee. Upon the decease of\r\nmy said son, Cornelius J., I give and bequeath the last mentioned\r\n$200,000 of bonds to my residuary legatee.”\r\n\r\nThough a portion of this provision is rather whimsical, yet it was ably\r\ndesigned to force “Corneel” to desist from his besetting sin, the gaming\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIf the trustees were permitted to pay him the whole of the interest at\r\nwhatever period they should choose, it seems harsh that the beneficiary\r\nshould forfeit it entirely, if he should seek to relieve present and\r\npressing necessities, by borrowing on his future income. It showed that\r\nthe Commodore, even at the hour of his death, thought that “Corneel” was\r\nnot fit to be treated otherwise than as a child, and that it was\r\nnecessary he should be kept under the guardianship of his brother.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance hurt “Corneel’s” feelings greatly, as he imagined\r\nhimself a bigger man, mentally, than Wm. H. This opinion, however, no\r\nother man could conscientiously endorse, except it might have been\r\nGreeley or Colfax.\r\n\r\n“Corneel,” though always exclaiming against the old man’s\r\nhard-heartedness, had an intense admiration for his father’s abilities,\r\nand he was as sensitive as a sunflower when any other person would say a\r\nword to disparage the Commodore. While railing constantly at the\r\nparsimony of his father, he was as devoted a hero-worshipper of the\r\nCommodore as Thomas Carlyle ever was of the greatest of his heroes, and\r\nhe never grew tired talking of his achievements, with the history of\r\nwhich he was thoroughly familiar. He had even a more intense hatred\r\nagainst Gould than his father had, and solemnly believed that Gould and\r\nFisk had, during the manipulation of the Erie “corner,” conspired to\r\nassassinate the Commodore.\r\n\r\nOf course this was one of his many hallucinations, and there was not the\r\nleast ground for it, but he had got it indelibly on the brain, and he\r\nwould not tolerate contradiction in that notion any more than in any\r\nother opinion which he had got fixed in his morbid mind. He once went\r\ninto an epileptic fit in the presence of a friend of mine who attempted\r\nto reason with him on the improbability of such a man as Gould\r\ncontemplating murder.\r\n\r\nHe never forgave his father for having him arrested and incarcerated in\r\nBloomingdale Lunatic Asylum. He had run off to California the time of\r\nthe gold fever, and shipped as a sailor. He was then in his eighteenth\r\nyear. When he returned, which was pretty soon, as he had no ability to\r\nenter into the terrible mental and physical struggle for wealth on the\r\ngold coast, his father had him arrested. It was soon discovered that he\r\nwas no lunatic, however eccentric he might be, and he was released, but\r\nhe took the matter dreadfully to heart, and it had a melancholy and\r\ndemoralizing effect upon all his future life. He was petulant, and still\r\ncomplaining, and often acted like a crazy man in that the more any of\r\nhis intimate friends tried to please him he seemed the more\r\ndissatisfied; yet it was impossible to get along with him without\r\nhumoring him, and it was almost next to impossible to humor him. In this\r\nway he could work on the minds of the strongest of his friends, so as\r\nalmost to put them into a fit as bad as one of his own.\r\n\r\nDr. Swazy’s patience was often put to a very severe test in his attempt\r\nto please this eccentric invalid.\r\n\r\n“Corneel” was a miser everywhere except at the gaming table, and would\r\ncling to a cent with greater tenacity than ordinary people display in\r\nholding on to a ten-dollar bill. But among the gamblers either a\r\nten-dollar bill or a hundred-dollar bill was less valuable in his eyes\r\nthan a cent in the common transactions of every day life. “Faro” and\r\n“keno” had terrific power over him. He has often been known to have had\r\nan epileptic fit at the gaming-table, get a doze afterwards which seemed\r\nlike the sleep of death, so cadaverous did he look on those occasions,\r\nand then awake up and go on with the play, whose fascination he appeared\r\nutterly powerless to resist.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the ears of the Commodore that Greeley was lending his\r\nson hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars at a time, he visited\r\nthe office of the _Tribune_. He rushed without ceremony into the\r\nsanctum, where Greeley was busy at his high desk, grinding out a tirade\r\nagainst some political or social abuse, and thus addressed the Sage of\r\nChappaqua: “Greeley, I hear yer lendin’ ‘Corneel’ money.” “Yes,” said\r\nGreeley, eyeing the monarch of steamboat men through his glasses, with\r\nan air of philosophic contempt mixed with commiseration; “I have let him\r\nhave some.” “I give you fair warning,” replied the Commodore, “that you\r\nneed not look to me; I won’t pay you.” “Who the devil asked you?”\r\nretorted Greeley. “Have I?”\r\n\r\nThis closed the interview. The Commodore retraced his steps down the\r\nrickety stairs into Spruce street, and Greeley continued to grind out\r\nhis illegible chirography for the profane printers. There is no record,\r\nI believe, that the subject was ever reverted to between them. Soon\r\nafter the death of Greeley the Commodore sent a check for $10,000 each\r\nto his two daughters.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore was well satisfied with the marriage of young “Corneel” to\r\nMiss Williams, of Hartford, Connecticut, and he had hoped that his son\r\nwould begin then to lead a new life, but he was doomed to\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThere is a good story told about an interview between the Commodore and\r\nMr. Williams prior to the marriage.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams called upon the Commodore at his office in Fourth street,\r\nnear Broadway, and informed him that his son, Cornelius Jeremiah, had\r\nasked his daughter in marriage, and she was willing if the Commodore had\r\nno objection to the union.\r\n\r\n“Has your daughter plenty of silk dresses?” asked the Commodore,\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Mr. Williams, showing some sensitiveness at what he at\r\nfirst considered assumption of superiority and purse-pride on the part\r\nof the Commodore, “my daughter, as I told you, is not wealthy. She has a\r\nfew dresses like other young ladies in her station, but her wardrobe is\r\nnot very extensive nor costly.”\r\n\r\n“Has your daughter plenty of jewelry?” continued the Commodore, without\r\nappearing to take much notice of Mr. Williams’ explanation.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied Mr. Williams, becoming slightly nettled, and showing\r\na laudable pride in opposition to what he considered a slur on account\r\nof his moderate means, “I have attempted to explain to you that I am in\r\ncomparatively humble circumstances, and my daughter cannot afford\r\njewelry.”\r\n\r\n“The reason I ask you,” pursued the Commodore, “is, that if she did\r\npossess these articles of value, my son would take them and either pawn\r\nor sell them, and throw away the proceeds at the gaming table. So I\r\nforewarn you and your daughter that I can’t take any responsibility in\r\nthis matter.”\r\n\r\nThe nuptials were duly consummated, however, in spite of the Commodore’s\r\nconstructive remonstrance.\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage “Corneel” asked his father for some money to build a\r\nhouse. “No, Corneel,” he said emphatically, “you have got to show that\r\nyou can be trusted before I trust you.”\r\n\r\nHis wife made application to her father-in-law with better success,\r\nhowever. He gave her a check for $10,000. In a few months afterward she\r\npaid another visit to the Commodore, who received her cordially, but\r\nexpected she had come for another loan, and he was attempting to work up\r\nhis courage to the point of refusal; for, strong and almost invincibly\r\nobdurate as he was in the general affairs of life, in the presence of\r\nthe fair sex, like Samson when he got his hair cut, he was weak and like\r\nanother man.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Commodore, addressing his daughter-in-law with a kindly\r\nsmile, “what can I do for you now?”\r\n\r\n“Well, papa,” she replied in her exceedingly candid and agreeable\r\nmanner, “we did not need all the money, so I brought you back $1,500.”\r\n\r\nThe Commodore could hardly believe his ears and eyes, and thought for a\r\nmoment that he must be under some mysterious delusion, superinduced by\r\nthe spiritual seances which he then was in the habit of attending. But\r\nwhen the cash was put in his hand he found it was a material reality.\r\nThis sealed a warm friendship between him and his worthy and economical\r\ndaughter-in-law, which was only severed by her premature death about ten\r\nyears before that of her unfortunate husband.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy that some people manifested for “Young Corneel” was, like\r\nhis own maladies, of the most morbid or delusive character. He had $200\r\na week from his father all the time that he was whining to the public\r\nabout his pinching poverty and denouncing the old man’s niggardliness.\r\nThis would have been ample, with fair economy, not only for all the\r\nnecessaries of life, but, under judicious management, would have\r\nafforded the recipient many of its luxuries.\r\n\r\nWith his irresistible propensity for gambling, he would not have been\r\nany better off physically, but worse, with the entire income from his\r\nfather’s 75 or 100 millions. The only difference that should have arisen\r\nwas that he would have been instrumental in carrying out in part the\r\nsocialistic and communistic idea of a wider distribution of private\r\nproperty, amassed by thrift, privation and industry, among the drones,\r\nlazy “loafers” and criminals of society.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore’s judgment, therefore, in limiting his prodigal son to\r\n$200 a week, was not only comprehensive, but beneficent in its results\r\nboth to his son and to society at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _C. Vanderbilt._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n   THE YOUNG VANDERBILTS AND THEIR FORTUNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE FOR PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL ABILITY.—THE MIXTURE OF RACES\r\n    AND THE LAW OF SELECTION.—THE WONDERFUL WILL AND THE WISE\r\n    DISTRIBUTION OF TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS.—TASTES, HABITS AND SOCIAL\r\n    PROCLIVITIES OF THE YOUNG VANDERBILTS.—THE MARRIED RELATIONS OF SOME\r\n    OF THEM.—BEING HAPPILY ASSORTED THEY MAKE GOOD HUSBANDS.—THEIR\r\n    PROPERTY REGARDED AS A GREAT TRUST.—THEIR RAILROAD SYSTEM AND ITS\r\n    GREAT ARMY OF EMPLOYES.—THE YOUNG MEN CAUTIOUS ABOUT SPECULATING,\r\n    AND CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR EXPENSES GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young Vanderbilts who have succeeded to the estate of their father,\r\nWilliam H., are all remarkable for both intellectual and physical power,\r\nas well as a high degree of refinement, showing how fast human evolution\r\nunder favorable circumstances progresses in this country. In other\r\ncountries it takes many generations to develop such men as the present\r\nVanderbilts. In this country three generations in this instance have\r\nproduced some of the best samples of nature’s nobility, which is\r\nsuperior in every respect to the proud and vain-glorious production\r\nwhich emanates from the succession of “a hundred earls” in England, or\r\neven a greater number of barons, princes and kings on the Continent of\r\nEurope. It would be difficult to produce better types of men in the\r\nshort period named than Cornelius, William K., Frederick and George\r\nVanderbilt, in personal appearance, breeding and culture.\r\n\r\nThe mixture and amalgamation of races from all parts of the world have\r\ndoubtless had a great deal to do with such favorable results in the\r\nreproduction of our species in the United States. In the old country\r\nclose intermarriages seem to have a deteriorating effect on the race,\r\nwith probably the one apparent exception, namely, the house of\r\nRothschild, and a little longer time may tell that the rule of\r\ndeterioration holds good in this case also.\r\n\r\nThe four sons of William H. Vanderbilt have had the greatest start in\r\nlife of any family in all the records of history, ancient and modern,\r\nwith the single exception, probably, of the five Rothschild brothers,\r\nthe sons of old Anselm, and they had not near so much money to begin\r\nwith, but had the advantage of the Vanderbilts in their locations and in\r\ntheir methods of combination. These methods, as I have observed\r\nelsewhere, could only be attained through the Hebrew religion. By the\r\nprovisions of the remarkable will, which revealed such enormous wealth\r\nas to make almost every other millionaire feel comparatively poor, the\r\ngreater portion of 200 million dollars was divided among the eight\r\nchildren of the testator. Millions were distributed in this case as\r\nother millionaires have been in the habit of dealing with thousands. The\r\nordinary human mind fails to grasp the idea of such a vast amount of\r\nwealth. If converted into gold it would have weighed 500 tons, and it\r\nwould have taken 500 strong horses to draw it from the Grand Central\r\nDepot to the Sub-Treasury in Wall Street. If it had been all in gold or\r\nsilver dollars, or even in greenbacks, it would have taken Vanderbilt\r\nhimself, working eight hours a day, over thirty years to count it. If\r\nthe first of the Vanderbilts had been a contemporary of old Adam,\r\naccording to the Mosaic account, and had then started as president of a\r\nrailroad through Palestine, with a salary of $30,000 a year, saving all\r\nthis money and living on perquisites, the situation being continued in\r\nthe male line to the present day, the sum total of all the family\r\nsavings thus accumulated would not amount to the fortune left by Wm. H.\r\nVanderbilt, unless this original $30,000 had been placed at compound\r\ninterest, and that in a bank from which young Napoleons of finance had\r\nbeen strictly excluded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _W K Vanderbilt_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe will itself affords one of the best tests on record of the sound\r\njudgment and equitable mind of the testator. He was under filial\r\nobligations to a certain extent to revere the memory and respect the\r\nopinions of the father through whom he had acquired the means of\r\naccumulating this wonderful fortune.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore had modified ideas of primogeniture, not exactly in the\r\nEnglish sense of the term, but he had an intense desire to perpetuate\r\nhis name and wealth, and would doubtless have advised William H., and\r\nperhaps he did, to bequeath nearly all his possessions to one of his\r\nsons, leaving the rest of the family a bare independence.\r\n\r\nWm. H., in accordance with his sensitive disposition, upright mind, and\r\na due respect for the feelings, opinions and even the prejudices of\r\nothers, resolved to make what public opinion would be likely to consider\r\nan approximately fair division of his immense estate. In this attempt, I\r\nthink he succeeded pretty well, considering all the circumstances and\r\ndifficulties with which he had to grapple. A synopsis of the will\r\nitself, however, herewith inserted, will enable the public to be the\r\nbest judge of the equity of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place Mr. Vanderbilt devised to his wife the palatial\r\nresidence, which cost two millions, situated between 51st and 52d\r\nstreets on Fifth avenue, the stables on Madison avenue, the paintings\r\nand statuary, and an annuity of $200,000 per annum. He also empowered\r\nher to dispose of, by will, in any way she might desire, $500,000 out of\r\nthe sum set apart to produce her annuity of $200,000.\r\n\r\nHe bequeathed to each of his four daughters, Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard,\r\nMrs. William Sloane, Mrs. Hamilton McK. Twombly and Mrs. William Seward\r\nWebb, an elegant house on Fifth avenue in the vicinity of his own\r\nmansion. He then devised 40 million dollars’ worth of securities, 25\r\nmillions of which were in United States bonds, to be divided by the\r\ntrustees equally among his eight children, five millions each. Next he\r\nbequeathed 40 millions more in securities, ten millions of which were in\r\nUnited States bonds, and the balance in securities of his own railroads,\r\nto his eight children, share and share alike.\r\n\r\nHe gave to his son Cornelius two million dollars in addition to all\r\nother bequests made to him.\r\n\r\nGeorge W., his youngest son, is to receive at the death of his mother\r\nall that she possessed during her natural life, and if he should die\r\nwithout issue his inheritance shall go to Wm. H., the son of Cornelius,\r\nbut in the event of this contingency not occurring, the grandson, Wm.\r\nH., is to receive a million on attaining the age of 30.\r\n\r\nThen followed a host of small legacies to relatives, friends and\r\nemployes. He left $2,000 a year to each of his uncle Jacob’s three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHe gave $200,000 to the Vanderbilt University of Nashville, Tenn.,\r\nfounded by his father; and he left about a million in the aggregate to\r\ntwelve charitable and religious institutions.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-second clause of the will is the most important, especially\r\nto his two eldest sons. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“All the rest, residue and remainder of all the property and estate,\r\nreal, personal and mixed, of every description and wheresoever situated,\r\nof which I may be seized or possessed, or to which I may be entitled at\r\nthe time of my decease, I give, devise and bequeath unto my two sons,\r\nCornelius Vanderbilt and William K. Vanderbilt, in equal shares, and to\r\ntheir heirs and assigns, to their use forever.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderbilt was appointed executrix and her four sons executors of\r\nthe will. The witnesses were Judge Charles A. Rapallo, Samuel F. Barger,\r\nC. C. Clarke and I. P. Chambers.\r\n\r\nThis remainder, left to his two sons named in the clause cited, amounted\r\nto about 50 million dollars each, in addition to their other bequests,\r\nthus leaving each of them nearly as wealthy as their grandfather was\r\nwhen he died. Cornelius is said to be worth over 80 million dollars.\r\n\r\nCornelius is the oldest son. He is a year or two over forty. He received\r\na good education, and had an excellent business training in his father’s\r\noffices at the Grand Central Depot. He has always been remarkable for\r\nstrict attention to business, and for his thorough familiarity with\r\neverything connected with his own department, as well as having a good\r\ngeneral knowledge of all the departments of the great railroad system.\r\nWhen his father retired from active work, and the presidency of the\r\nroads, Cornelius succeeded him as Chairman of the Board of Directors in\r\nNew York Central and Michigan Central.\r\n\r\nWm. K. took a similar position in Lake Shore, and was also elected\r\nPresident of New York, Chicago & St. Louis, generally called the Nickel\r\nPlate road.\r\n\r\nCornelius was married about fourteen years ago to Miss Alice Gwinn, a\r\nhandsome young lady of Cincinnati, and has four children. He resides in\r\nan elegant house, at the corner of Fifty-seventh street and Fifth\r\nAvenue, and has a handsome summer residence, “The Breakers,” at Newport.\r\n\r\nHe is connected, as an active worker, with various charitable and\r\nreligious institutions, and is very favorably known and highly respected\r\nin the best social circles. He is gaining a great reputation through\r\nvarious donations to laudable objects. Among these may be mentioned the\r\nClub House in the vicinity of the Grand Central Depot, for the\r\naccommodation of employes of the various railroads connected with the\r\nVanderbilt system. Also his magnificent gift to the Metropolitan Museum\r\nof Art, the celebrated picture of Rosa Bonheur, “The Horse Fair,” which\r\nis valued at $60,000. In this he surpassed the most liberal efforts of\r\nMr. George I. Seney, in one of his grand specialties, namely,\r\ncontributions to Art.\r\n\r\nWilliam Kissam Vanderbilt, the second son of Wm. H., also received a\r\nfair education, and graduated in business in the Transportation\r\nDepartment of his father’s great railroad system, where he exhibited\r\nmarked ability in mastering all the essentials, and in doing his work\r\nwith rapidity and accuracy. He is considered the most handsome and the\r\nmost imposing in appearance of any of the family, although, as I have\r\nintimated at the beginning of this chapter, they are all above the\r\naverage in regard to the manly and gentlemanly virtues, owing to what\r\nDarwin would have designated the “natural law of selection.” Wm. K. has\r\na grand mansion, on the corner of Fifty-second street and Fifth Avenue,\r\nand a country residence at Islip, Long Island, where he usually summers.\r\nHe is about thirty-eight years of age. He is married to Miss Alva Smith,\r\nthe daughter of a wealthy merchant of Savannah. She is a leading lady in\r\nsociety, considerably above the average in good looks, and possessed of\r\nrare conversational powers, with an ample fund of wit and humor. They\r\nhave three children.\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Vanderbilt, the third son of the late millionaire, seemed\r\nto have had a greater desire for study than the two former, hence after\r\ngoing through the ordinary course for boys at home, he went to Yale,\r\nwhere he graduated in the Sheffield Scientific School. Thus equipped he\r\nwent into his father’s office, and made himself thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the general routine of the whole business, in every department.\r\n\r\nHe married Mrs. Torrance, formerly the wife of his cousin. Young\r\nVanderbilt fell in love with her and married her in a year afterward.\r\nShe is an exceedingly attractive woman, and the union is a very happy\r\none. Mr. Vanderbilt gave Frederick the house at Fortieth street and\r\nFifth Avenue, in which he himself had resided prior to his removal to\r\nthe Fifth Avenue palace. This house was built by the old Commodore for\r\nhis son W. H. It was considered to be the finest residence in the city\r\nat the time of its completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _F. W. Vanderbilt._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Vanderbilt, the youngest of the four sons, is now about 25\r\nyears of age. He is not so robust as the others, but enjoys pretty good\r\nhealth. He manifested a decided tendency at an early age for study and\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nHe is said to be extensively read in literature for his age, and has\r\nwritten some essays on various subjects, which give considerable promise\r\nof success with perseverance in that line. He is a lover of the\r\nfine-arts, knows the history of all the pictures in the great gallery\r\nwhich his father collected, and like that revered parent, whose constant\r\ncompanion he was during the last few years of his life, he is very fond\r\nof the opera. His grandfather, the Commodore, left him a million\r\ndollars, to which his father added another million on his twenty-first\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. has recently made a handsome present to the Bond street free\r\npublic library, donating thereto $40,000 to build a branch of that\r\ninstitution at 251 West Thirteenth street. He bids fair to be a liberal\r\npatron of letters, and no doubt his gifts in this way will be prudently\r\ndirected and made with good judgment. The man who can appreciate\r\nlearning, as George Vanderbilt has proved he can, will never be likely\r\nto leave the terms of an endowment to a public library, for instance,\r\nwhich he intended for the benefit of the whole community, so loose that\r\na clique of trustees can restrict all its privileges to a limited number\r\nof ladies and gentlemen of leisure, by narrowing the hours of keeping\r\nthe institution open, as has been done with those two fine libraries\r\nintended by the donors for the people at large, namely, the Astor and\r\nthe Lenox.\r\n\r\nNew York is comparatively poor in its libraries, even on the supposition\r\nthat these public trusts should not be tampered with, and their original\r\nobject defeated; but when the best of them are diverted from the purpose\r\noriginally intended by the philanthropists who presented them to the\r\npublic, a great wrong is inflicted on the citizens of New York.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal said and written during the past few years\r\nabout the Vanderbilt system of railroads being a great monopoly. I am\r\nnot in favor of monopolies. On the contrary, I have, in this book, as\r\nwell as through other mediums of reaching the public, and in interviews\r\npublished all over the country, denounced monopolies in very strong\r\nterms. I regard the Vanderbilt properly, however, in the light of a\r\ngreat trust, the four young men above referred to, with Chauncey M.\r\nDepew, the President of New York Central, being the trustees, and I\r\nquestion very much if that eminent team of honest and able reformers,\r\nHenry George and the Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn, with other minor lights of\r\nthe Anti-Poverty Society, could administer that trust with greater\r\nbenefit to the public, nor could they employ a greater army of\r\nwell-paid, easy-worked, and well-fed men by any State or National\r\nsupervision or management, or by breaking up the great corporation into\r\nprobably a hundred or more small companies.\r\n\r\nThe Vanderbilt system employs 200,000 people at better wages than they\r\ncan obtain elsewhere, any place in the world. It pays over $150 an hour\r\nfor taxes. The State is paid $1 for every $2.70 received by the\r\nstockholders.\r\n\r\nNor can I think it possible that the paternal system of Government\r\nproposed by the Socialists, with all the modern discoveries and\r\nappliances of dynamite to aid them, could accomplish as much in a\r\ncentury for the well-being and advantage of the people of this State and\r\nof the whole country as the Vanderbilt system of railroads has done in\r\nhalf that time. I see no reason, therefore, to regard the present\r\nVanderbilt regime as a grinding monopoly.\r\n\r\nUntil the Georgeites, the McGlynnites, and the Socialists demonstrate\r\nthat their untried systems will confer greater happiness on humanity\r\nthan honest enterprise in the best circumstances, under our present\r\nsocial system, with all its defects, has developed, I shall be tardy in\r\nsubscribing my adhesion to the new order of things.\r\n\r\nI don’t wish to be understood for a moment as implying that I am averse\r\nto free thought, the highest development of humanity, mentally and\r\nphysically, and the most advanced evolution in the same direction. I aim\r\nat keeping abreast of all these within the free exercise of my own\r\njudgment, and it is thus that I can heartily applaud Dr. McGlynn for his\r\npolite but firm refusal to visit the Eternal City for the purpose of\r\nbeing corrected or regulated in regard to free thought and free speech,\r\nas viewed from the American standpoint, by a foreign potentate, who\r\nassumes the guardianship and governorship of all human affairs, both\r\nfrom a spiritual and secular point of view.\r\n\r\nThe days of Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII.) are gone for ever, and Leo\r\nXIII. should have sense enough to know it. McGlynn will never stand,\r\nlike Henry IV., shivering in his shirt at the door of the Vatican,\r\nawaiting his sentence of penance to Canossa. Bismarck, however, came\r\npretty near repeating this little historical episode not long since, but\r\nthe great Chancellor of the German Empire, unlike McGlynn, did not have\r\nthe advantage of an American education, and the independence which it\r\nconfers. He may, therefore, to some extent be excused. I think, however,\r\nthat McGlynn will stick, and I admire his firmness. No church, no matter\r\nhow powerful its foreign allies may be, can suppress free speech in the\r\nhome of the brave and the land of the free.\r\n\r\nSo, in their battle for freedom of speech, I admire the pluck of the\r\nGeorge-McGlynn party, but as regards their social theories, I shall\r\nremain in a waiting mood until I see them more fully demonstrated.\r\n\r\nTo return from this little digression, however, I wish to express the\r\nhope that the young Vanderbilts will manage their vast estate so as to\r\ninure to the public benefit in such a way that the most fastidious\r\nSocialist will be unable to take exception to the benign results.\r\n\r\nThe young Vanderbilts have at intervals speculated in Wall Street, but\r\nconservatively, with the exception of William K., who, in the past, has\r\nmade numerous and spasmodic turns, chiefly on the advice of older\r\noperators, which have not always redounded to his interest. As a rule\r\nthese young men are shrewd and cautious financiers, and I think it is\r\nsafe to say that none of them will run the risk of losing his handsome\r\nfortune in speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From Harper’s Magazine.

The house\r\nis represented in America by Mr. August Belmont, than whom there is no\r\nbanker more widely known and more highly regarded all the world over. It\r\nis due to the wise and conservative management of Mr. Belmont that the\r\nfamous Rothschilds have reaped millions of profits from American\r\nsources. The original name of Rothschild was Bauer. The family adopted\r\nthe name Rothschild (Red Shield) from the sign which the founder of the\r\nhouse kept over his dingy little shop in Frankfort-on-the-Main, in the\r\nodoriferous quarter called the Judengasse (Jews’ street). In this little\r\nshop Mayer Anselm Rothschild, the founder of the house, discounted\r\nbills, changed money, examined the quality of coins, bought cheap and\r\nsold dear. “How do you get so rich, Mr. Rothschild?” said a friend of\r\nhis to old Anselm one day, as he leaned over his dusky little counter.\r\nThe original head of the great house said: “I buys ‘sheep’ and sells\r\n‘deer.’” His knowledge of the quality of coins was marvellous. He could\r\ndetect a light coin the moment he took it in his hand, and there was no\r\nimitation diamond or gem could escape his eye. He had the instinct of\r\ngenius in detecting everything in the form of money or jewelry that was\r\nnot genuine. He was a walking directory so far as the financial standing\r\nof every commercial man in Frankfort and in several other important\r\ncities in Germany was concerned. At the age of seventeen young\r\nRothschild took rank with the best, oldest and ablest financiers of\r\nFrankfort. His father, who died when Mayer Anselm was thirteen years of\r\nage, had intended to make him a Rabbi, but the coin had such attraction\r\nfor him, that it quickly drew him from the Talmud, and he established\r\nhimself in his father’s narrow quarters as a financier.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that Rothschild’s first great start in\r\nfinancial life was given to him by the use of the twenty million dollars\r\nwhich was paid to the Landgrave of Hesse, Frederic II., by George III.\r\nof England, for 17,000 Hessians to help to whip George Washington and\r\nretain the American Colonies. This blood money was the original basis of\r\nthe vast fortune of the Rothschilds. It was deposited with Mayer Anselm\r\nby William IX., the successor of Frederic, whose example was followed by\r\nother great ones of the earth, and in a few years the agents of the\r\nkings and princes of Europe were flocking to Frankfort to negotiate\r\nloans with Rothschild on behalf of their mighty patrons.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting story related, giving the reason why the\r\nLandgrave passed by all the great bankers of Frankfort and entrusted\r\nthis large amount, together with a similar amount afterwards, to\r\nRothschild. The latter had occasion to visit Prince William at his\r\npalace in Cassel, and found him playing a game of chess with Baron\r\nEstorff. Rothschild prudently kept quiet and did not interrupt the game,\r\nbut stepped lightly up and stood behind the prince’s chair, where he\r\ncould watch every move. The Prince was getting the worst of the game,\r\nand was becoming a little excited. Turning around, he said: “Rothschild,\r\ndo you understand chess?” “Sufficiently well, your Serene Highness,”\r\nreplied Rothschild, “to induce me, were the game mine, to castle on the\r\nking’s side.” The Prince took the hint, and won the game. Then turning\r\nto Rothschild, he said: “You are a wise man. He who can extricate a\r\nchess player from such a difficulty as I was in, must have a very clear\r\nhead for business.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince afterwards told the Baron that Rothschild was as good a chess\r\nplayer as Frederic the Great, and that a man of such capacity must be\r\nable to take good care of money. The forty millions which were obtained\r\non deposit remained with the house of Rothschild for nine years, and\r\nwhen Napoleon invaded Germany in the interim, the money, together with\r\nother valuables, was hidden in wine casks in Rothschild’s cellar, but\r\nthe Conqueror never thought of tapping the casks. After peace was\r\nproclaimed, and William, who had been obliged to seek safety in flight,\r\nreturned home, old Rothschild was dead, but his son Anselm handed over\r\nto the Prince every dollar of the forty millions, and tendered him in\r\naddition two per cent. interest for the entire time of the deposit. The\r\nPrince made him a present of the interest.\r\n\r\nThe elder Rothschild had five sons, namely: Anselm, who succeeded his\r\nfather in Frankfort; Solomon, of Vienna; Nathan Mayer, of London;\r\nCharles, of Naples; and James, of Paris. According to their father’s\r\nwill, the five sons were to constitute but one firm, in which they were\r\nto enjoy equal profits, and never divide the fortune. The business was\r\nto be managed at Frankfort as headquarters, to which great money centre\r\nall the profits from the other moneyed capitals were to be raked in. The\r\nintention of the old man was to make these five money kings dominate\r\nEurope by the power of their wealth, so that the ordinary kings would\r\nbecome their subjects, and in many instances the hopes of the great old\r\nchess player have been realized. All the annual settlements were made at\r\nFrankfort, and the brothers met there at least once a year for a general\r\nconference. This system continues, and though the original five brothers\r\nhave all passed over to the majority, the last of them, James, having\r\ndied in Paris in 1868, at the ripe age of 76, yet the representatives of\r\nthe house in the large cities of Europe sustain the principles of union,\r\nharmony and consolidation laid down by old Anselm Mayer Rothschild.\r\nAlthough this union has been the great source of the Rothschilds’\r\nsuccess, it would be hopeless, however, for any other parent outside the\r\nHebrew race to imitate the injunction of old Rothschild. The idea of an\r\nequal division of the profits could not be entertained for a moment by\r\nan American. The socialistic family tie that enjoined such an\r\narrangement could only be rendered binding through the power of the\r\nHebrew religion. Just imagine how an American would feel if by some\r\nlucky turn of fortune, like that of Nathan Rothschild in London, after\r\nthe battle of Waterloo, he should make six millions in a day, and be\r\nrequested to divide it with his four brothers! He would sooner spend a\r\nmillion of it to try and break the old man’s will, and employ several of\r\nthe best sophistical lawyers he could find to prove that his father was\r\ndemented.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the elder Rothschild died worth 15 or 20 millions,\r\nbut this is in a great measure merely conjecture, as nobody outside the\r\nfamily ever knew what their real wealth was, this fact having always\r\nbeen kept an inviolate family secret. It must be said, to the credit of\r\nthe old man, that in his latter days, instead of becoming stingy, as\r\nmany do, he was quite liberal, and, according to the scriptural\r\ninjunction, distributed his alms in secret, without even permitting his\r\nsons to know anything about the matter. He contributed largely to\r\nvarious charities in the same way. It is said he would go through the\r\npoverty-stricken districts of the city after night, giving money to the\r\nneedy, from whom he would retreat before giving them time to thank him\r\nfor his beneficence. He had a notion that those who gave without\r\nreceiving thanks were greater favorites with the Divine Being, who rules\r\nthe destinies of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From Harper’s Magazine. Copyright, 1873, by Harper & Brothers.\r\n  NATHAN MAYER ROTHSCHILD.\r\n  (The Financial Hero of Waterloo.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest speculator of the five brothers was Nathan Mayer\r\nRothschild, the third son of the great old man. He made the grand hit of\r\nhis life after the battle of Waterloo. He kept watching the movements of\r\nthe opposing armies on the Continent, and followed Wellington very\r\nclosely as he approached the famous field. It seems that the Iron Duke\r\nwas not at all pleased with Nathan’s attention to him, as he took him\r\nfor either a spy or an assassin, and was on the point of having him\r\narrested several times. But Nathan kept his purpose steadily in view, in\r\nspite of the fact that bullets were whizzing around his ears in showers.\r\nHe sat on his horse on the hill of Hougomont with perfect composure in\r\nthe teeming rain the whole afternoon, looking upon that terrible\r\nstruggle that was to decide the destiny of nations, until Blucher\r\narrived and the French were put to route.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Nathan saw this he put spurs to his steed and made all\r\npossible haste to Brussels, where a carriage with swift horses was in\r\nwaiting to carry him to Ostend. At day light next morning he arrived on\r\nthe Belgian coast, where he found it exceedingly difficult to obtain a\r\nboat, the sea being very rough. At length he obtained a boatman as\r\ncourageous as himself, who undertook the task for 2,500 francs, and\r\nlanded him at Dover in the evening. He lost no time, but with relays of\r\nthe swiftest horses pushed forward to London, and was on the Exchange\r\nnext morning ready for business, long before the opening of the market.\r\nThat was the morning of the 20th, only a day and two nights after the\r\nbattle that decided the fate of nations. Nathan had performed a great\r\nfeat. He acted his role well. Like the great hero whose political\r\nhistory had just closed, Nathan was “grand, gloomy and peculiar,” in the\r\nfinancial sense of the phrase. He was an embodiment of the latest\r\ninformation from the Continent. In defiance of winds and waves he had,\r\nat the risk of his life, outstripped the swiftest couriers and the best\r\nspecial correspondents of that day. The great operators flocked around\r\nhim asking, “What is the news?” Nathan sighed heavily and seemed\r\nreluctant to tell. Eventually, this important piece of information was\r\nextorted from him, in strict confidence: “Blucher, at the head of his\r\nvast army of veterans, was defeated by Napoleon at Ligny, on the 16th\r\nand 17th (of June), and there can be no hope for Wellington with his\r\ncomparatively small and undisciplined force.” This statement was\r\nsubstantially true, and it forcibly reminds one of Tennyson’s poetic\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n                 “A lie which is all a lie\r\n                    May be met and fought with outright,\r\n                  But a lie which is half a truth,\r\n                    Is a harder matter to fight.”\r\n\r\nTrue, Blucher had been repulsed at Ligny. The Duke had an awkward squad,\r\nwith the exception of the English, the Irish, and the Scotch Greys, to\r\nmarshal in fighting order, but he “got there all the same.” Nathan’s\r\nsecret point soon oozed out, and in less than an hour after the opening\r\nthere was a perfect panic on the London Stock Exchange. Nathan had his\r\nbrokers at work, first selling “short,” and then, when the market\r\nreached bed rock, buying on the long side. He bought everything that he\r\ncould raise, borrow or beg the money for—consols, notes and bills. When\r\nthe news of Wellington’s victory arrived, forty-eight hours after Nathan\r\nhad begun to manipulate the market, and when he was “long” of everything\r\nthat he had money or credit to purchase, securities went up with a boom.\r\nNathan realized six million dollars, and it is said that a large number\r\nof the great operators flocked around him to congratulate him. It was\r\nlucky for Nathan that the scene of his operations was in London instead\r\nof Wall Street, otherwise Judge Lynch might have had something to say\r\nbefore the settlements had been made.\r\n\r\nThe career of Nathan Rothschild in England was remarkable, and his\r\nsuccess from the very start phenomenal. He began his speculations and\r\nmoney-lending operations in Manchester with $500, being the limited\r\namount which he was permitted to draw from the family treasury on taking\r\nhis departure from Frankfort to seek his fortune in Great Britain. In\r\nfive years he had augmented the $500 to a million. He then removed to\r\nLondon. There he married a daughter of Levi Cohen, one of the wealthiest\r\nHebrews of the great metropolis, well known by the pseudonym of\r\nPound-Adoring Cohen. His father-in-law was afraid that Nathan would soon\r\nruin himself, so reckless did he seem in his speculations, estimated by\r\nthe conservative standard of old Cohen.\r\n\r\nNathan was very fortunate in his speculative ventures in the public\r\nfunds, and managed to get himself introduced so as to do considerable\r\nbusiness for the Government in its transactions on the Continent. His\r\nfirst introduction to the Government was through the Duke of Wellington,\r\nwho during his peninsular campaigns had made drafts that the Treasury of\r\nGreat Britain was dilatory in meeting. Nathan purchased these drafts at\r\na large discount. He afterwards renewed them to the Government, and they\r\nwere eventually redeemed at par. This was the means of bringing him into\r\nconfidential relations with the ministry of Great Britain, and he was\r\nentirely trusted as their chief agent in all their financial matters on\r\nthe Continent. This gave him immense advantage in speculating, and\r\nenabled him to give his brothers in the other great capitals of Europe a\r\nlarge amount of valuable and inside information, which put them in a\r\nposition to speculate with success in the funds of their respective\r\nGovernments. Nathan had made arrangements to get the very latest\r\ninformation from Frankfort, then the centre of European financiering, by\r\nwell trained carrier pigeons. He had also several boats of his own by\r\nwhich to send personal messages across the channel in cases where these\r\nwere requisite, and a boat always in readiness at a moment’s notice in\r\ncase his presence should be indispensable at the great money centre, and\r\nthe central counting and clearing house of the family.\r\n\r\nNathan Rothschild was a strange and inconsistent compound of liberality,\r\navariciousness, and penuriousness. He entertained his guests in a\r\nprincely style, and often princes were mingled with those guests, but he\r\nwas miserably mean with his clerks and employees generally. Unlike A. T.\r\nStewart, who followed the very opposite rule, and had his place filled\r\nwith bankrupt dry goods men as employees, the Rothschilds would never\r\nengage anybody who had been unfortunate in business. They had a\r\nsuperstitious feeling that misfortune is contagious, and they carefully\r\navoided coming in contact with any of its victims. Nathan was even more\r\nprecise than Wm. H. Vanderbilt in calculating the pennies in his lunch\r\nbill; but while Vanderbilt did this as a mere whim to illustrate his\r\nbusiness precision and correctness, Rothschild really loved the pennies\r\nwith ardent devotion. But Baron Nathan, even when he had accumulated\r\n$70,000,000 or $80,000,000, was not happy. He was tortured by the fear\r\nof enemies, who, he believed, intended to murder him. Like Vanderbilt,\r\nhe received many threatening letters; but unlike the New York\r\nmillionaire, who paid no attention to threats, but walked and drove out\r\ndefiantly, Rothschild was still in mortal terror, and believed that the\r\nthreats were intended to be executed. Nathan made one of his biggest\r\npiles out of the Almaden quicksilver mines in Spain. The Spanish\r\nGovernment wanted a loan, which he granted, receiving the mines as\r\nsecurity for several years. He got up a “corner” in quicksilver, and\r\nraised the price 100 per cent. He realized almost $6,000,000 out of this\r\ntransaction. It was as good for him as the Waterloo deal, only the\r\nreturns did not come in so quickly. Nathan died in Frankfort, at the age\r\nof 59, in 1836. His last words were, “He is trying to kill me. Quick,\r\nquick, give me the gold.” His death created a panic on the London Stock\r\nExchange, and the Continental Bourses were greatly embarrassed by the\r\nevent. The news was conveyed by a carrier pigeon, which was shot by a\r\nboy near Brighton. The message was briefly, _Il est mort_-“He is dead.”\r\nThe interests of the house of Rothschild are now scattered over the\r\nglobe, and it is probable that the aggregate wealth of all the branches\r\nof the firm, including the possessions of the various members of their\r\nfamilies, exceeds $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _W R Travers_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n                   TRAVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNIQUE CHARACTER OF TRAVERS—HIS VERSATILE ATTAINMENTS—ALTHOUGH OF A\r\n    GENIAL AND HUMOROUS DISPOSITION, HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEAR—HOW HE\r\n    WAS THE MEANS OF PRESERVING THE COMMERCIAL SUPREMACY OF NEW YORK—HE\r\n    SQUASHES THE ENGLISH BRAVADO, AND SAVES THE ORATORICAL HONOR OF OUR\r\n    COUNTRY—HAS THE OYSTER BRAINS?—IT MUST HAVE BRAINS.

OTHER\r\n    WITTICISMS, &C.\r\n\r\n\r\nWm. R. Travers is one of the most notable men of Wall Street in our\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHis success in speculation has usually been on the bear side, which is\r\nrather singular, as he is a man of such a genial disposition, with a\r\nkind nature, an inexhaustible supply of sparkling wit, and always\r\nbrimful of humor.\r\n\r\nHe is also fond of athletic sports of every description, and, in fact,\r\nis a kind of universal genius, so various and versatile are his\r\nattainments. Owing to his immense variety of qualities, tastes and\r\npursuits, he has one of the most remarkable records in Wall Street; and\r\nthe most singular thing about him, probably, is, that while having all\r\nthe attributes usually inherent in a bull, he has always been a bear in\r\nhis transactions.\r\n\r\nThis genial, benevolent and high spirited man has never been known to\r\nbelieve that there was any value in any property.\r\n\r\nIf he ever by chance happened to make any money on the bull side of the\r\nmarket, it must have made him feel very uncomfortable—in fact,\r\nconscientiously miserable—as he could not realize that by any\r\npossibility it belonged to him.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Mr. Travers, however, that New York has been so highly\r\nclassified in the catalogue of cities, in fact, as occupying the highest\r\nposition in public estimation, and that it has attained full credit for\r\nbeing the largest in wealth and population of any city in the Union.\r\nThis fact, now generally admitted, seemed to have been suspended in\r\ndoubt until Mr. Travers came from Baltimore to reside in our midst.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered by many Wall Street men that prior to the advent\r\nof Mr. Travers the rivalry among several of the seaboard cities on the\r\nAtlantic coast was very keen. Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore were\r\neach in turn disposed to claim pre-eminence. Thanks to this Wall Street\r\nmagnate, the matter is now no longer in dispute. It was finally decided\r\nin this way:\r\n\r\nOne day after Mr. Travers became one of ourselves, an old friend from\r\nBaltimore met him in Wall Street. As it had been a long time since they\r\nsaw each other, they had a considerable number of topics to talk over.\r\nThey had been familiar friends in the Monumental City, and were not\r\ntherefore restrained by the usual social formalities.\r\n\r\n“I notice, Travers,” said the Baltimorean, “that you stutter a great\r\ndeal more than when you were in Baltimore.”\r\n\r\n“W-h-y, y-e-s,” replied Mr. Travers, darting a look of surprise at his\r\nfriend; “of course I do. This is a d-d-damned sight b-b-bigger city.”\r\n\r\nThat settled it. Since this famous interview, and this scientific\r\nexplanation given by Mr. Travers to his old friend, no skeptic has had\r\nsufficient temerity to entertain any doubt regarding the financial and\r\ncommercial supremacy of New York; its leading position as the great\r\nemporium of the Continent has never since been questioned; and there are\r\nfew cities outside of Ohio that can claim such power in politics.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Mr. Travers, also, that this country still retains the palm\r\nfor oratory and volubility in speech, and has successfully resisted the\r\nintrusive and pretentious claims of Great Britain in regard to that\r\ngreat and somewhat limited accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe destiny of this nation in that respect hung in the balance at one\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA sort of go-as-you-please oratorical contest was being arranged to\r\ndecide the question of championship between Great Britain and ourselves,\r\nand a vaunting and loquacious Britisher had appeared in our midst to\r\ndispute the claim of the national cup in oratory as Rowell had done for\r\nthe belt in pedestrianism.\r\n\r\nThis English bravado had letters of introduction from Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, Sir Charles Dilke, Lord Salisbury, Mr. Gladstone, and other\r\nBritish declaimers to Mr. Travers and other American gentlemen. It was\r\nin the yachting season, and the voluble champion was invited to\r\naccompany a party, of which Mr. Travers was the leading spirit, down the\r\nbay in Mr. Travers’ yacht. The orator had talked everybody within\r\nearshot of his voice almost deaf. When the party arrived at the dinner\r\ntable it was hoped that he would cease for a short time; but when every\r\nother topic seemed exhausted, as well as the patience of his listeners,\r\nhe started off with renewed fluency on the subject of oysters, which\r\nconstituted the dish then at table.\r\n\r\n“It is now a debatable point among scientists,” he began, “as to whether\r\nor not the oyster has brains.” Travers, who up to this time had endured\r\nthe infliction of his loquacious guest, with the calmness of Job, said,\r\n“I think the oyster must have b-b-brains because it knows enough when to\r\nsh-sh-shut up.”\r\n\r\nBy this satiric stroke the English orator was dumbfounded and almost\r\nparalyzed; his fluent tongue ceased to wag with its usual volubility,\r\nand when requested to name his time for the international contest, he\r\nbegged to be excused until cured of his cold. He took the next steamer\r\nfor Liverpool, and has not been heard of since. Mr. Travers’ incisive\r\nremark about the mental attributes of the oyster thoroughly squashed\r\nhim, and saved the oratorical honor of our country.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers started in life in the grocery business in Baltimore, but\r\ndisaster overtaking him there, he came to New York, and soon thereafter\r\nformed a co-partnership with Leonard W. Jerome, the firm being Travers &\r\nJerome. Mr. Travers met with fair prosperity from the start, and soon\r\naccumulated wealth. The worst set-back probably that he ever received\r\nduring his residence in this city was on one occasion on his way home\r\nafter the business day was over. Being attracted by the display in the\r\nwindow of a bird fancier and dog dealer, from curiosity he was tempted\r\nto enter the place. One of the conspicuous objects that met his eye was\r\na very large sized parrot. Mr. Travers inquired of the proprietor of the\r\nestablishment who was in attendance “i-i-if th-th-th-that p-p-parrot\r\nc-c-could t-t-talk?”\r\n\r\nIts owner quickly replied, “If it couldn’t talk better than you, I’d cut\r\nits damned head off.”\r\n\r\nMr. Travers for a long time afterwards made up his mind some time or\r\nother to get even with this dealer in animals and birds, and succeeded\r\nmost effectually. His coachman made a complaint to him that the stable\r\nwas overrun with rats. Mr. Travers said, “Well, you m-m-must hunt for a\r\nr-r-rat dog.” The coachman made it known that Mr. Travers wanted a dog,\r\nand all those engaged dealing in dogs overran Mr. Travers’ house as\r\nferociously as the rats had overrun the stable, to get him to buy a dog.\r\nAmong the rest who responded was this identical man who kept the store\r\nwhere the parrot was. Mr. Travers recognized him at once, and told him,\r\n“I-i-if he w-w-would b-b-b-be d-d-down at the s-s-stable in the\r\nm-morning with t-th-the d-d-dog, he would g-g-give him a tr-tr-trial,\r\nand if he p-pr-proved to b-b-be a g-g-good r-rat c-c-catcher, would\r\nb-b-buy him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Travers sent for his coachman and told him to catch three or four\r\nrats and put them in the bin, and he would be down in the morning to try\r\nthe dog. So, good and early next morning Mr. Travers was on hand at the\r\nstable, and also the dog man and his terrier. Three rats having already\r\nbeen put into the bin, Mr. Travers ordered the dog put inside, as the\r\nman said he was ready for the fray, and the rats were so ferocious, and\r\nshowed such determined fight, that they kept the dog at bay, and he took\r\nto the corner of the bin for protection. By and by the owner pushed him\r\nright on the rats, and after a pretty fierce tussle he did secure one of\r\nthem and shook him until dead. This success encouraged a tussle with\r\nanother, which, after a long fight, shared the same fate. The third rat,\r\nhowever, was determined to resist the dog, and did so nobly and\r\nfiercely, making a prolonged fight, which resulted in a draw, and it was\r\nhard to tell which was the worst hurt, the dog or the rat.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dog then turned to Mr. Travers and said: “Now you see\r\nwhat a fine dog that is, won’t you buy him?” Mr. Travers replied: “I\r\nd-d-don’t w-w-want t-t-to b-b-buy the d-d-dog, b-b-but I’ll b-b-b-buy\r\nthe r-rat.”\r\n\r\nMr. Travers, when he first saw the owner of this dog, remembered him in\r\nconnection with the parrot. Since the rat fight, however, this same man\r\nhas never ceased to remember Mr. Travers, so that honors remain easy\r\nbetween them. Mr. Travers has never been known to be at a loss for wit\r\nto meet an emergency, and it is recognized that it flows as freely from\r\nhis lips and in as perfectly natural a way, as ordinary conversation\r\ndoes from most people.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Spring of last year, on the advice of his physician, Mr.\r\nTravers took his maiden trip to Europe, and would not have gone but for\r\nthe urgency of the case, always regarding that this country was big\r\nenough for him without leaving its shores. When he reached England,\r\nhowever, he found, when his arrival was announced through the medium of\r\nthe papers, that he was as well known amongst the nobility, sporting\r\nworld and other distinguished people there as he was in his own country,\r\nowing to his connection with the turf and athletic sports, together with\r\nhis widely published witticisms which had preceded him. He consequently\r\nwas overpowered by attention and hospitality, and participated to as\r\nfull an extent as his health would permit. He attended the Derby, and\r\ntook an interest in a pool which resulted in his favor. As soon as he\r\nascertained his good fortune, he went to bag his money, but found that\r\nthe pool man had decamped with the funds. This was a sad disappointment.\r\nHe could scarcely believe his eyes or the various statements which went\r\nto corroborate this man’s disappearance, but it was evident that he was\r\n_non est_, as he was nowhere to be found about the stand or on the\r\nfield. Travers made complaint to a policeman, who appeared perfectly\r\nindifferent to the charge. Mr. Travers said: “W-w-we d-don’t d-d-do\r\nth-th-that way in m-my c-c-c-country. I b-b-belong to America.” The\r\npoliceman turned impertinently and said: “You had better go back to your\r\nown country, if that’s the case.” This was an indignity to which Mr.\r\nTravers did not feel inclined to submit, and he at once exhibited his\r\nbadge, which admitted him to the royal stand. The policeman recognized\r\nit with affright, and almost fell on his knees in making profuse\r\napologies and offers of service, showing the cringing spirit which\r\nprevails in England to royalty and nobility, by the people who occupy\r\nthe position as servants to these high-born personages. Mr. Travers\r\noverlooked this official rudeness, and submitted to his loss as\r\ncheerfully as possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Travers on board the Newport boat immediately on his return,\r\nand he told me this story. I replied, “that I was surprised that a man\r\nof that character should have acted so villainously, as I had always\r\nsupposed that such men were influenced by the recognized principle the\r\nworld over, of honor among thieves.” Mr. Travers instantly replied: “No\r\none could have t-t-told him that I was a th-th-thief.”\r\n\r\nI remember another instance, which was during the war period. I had\r\nwritten a series of letters on national financial matters, which were\r\nthen before the country for discussion, and they were published in the\r\nNew York _Times_. Mr. Travers was met on his way down town by a Wall\r\nStreet friend on the morning that one of these letters appeared in the\r\npaper, who asked Mr. Travers if he had seen Mr. Clews’ last letter. Mr.\r\nTravers said, “I h-h-hope so.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this I was a guest at a dinner party at the Union Club,\r\nand was late in presenting myself. When I reached the entertainment\r\n(which was a sort of mutual admiration gathering), the speeches had\r\ncommenced, and I no sooner had taken my seat than Mr. Lawrence Jerome\r\nproposed my health. While it was being drank, Mr. Travers, who sat\r\nimmediately opposite, came over and whispered in my ear, “Clews, you\r\nd-d-don’t w-want t-to speak so soon after c-c-oming in here, d-d-do\r\nyou?” “No, I do not,” I replied. “I’ll t-t-tell th-th-them so, will I?”\r\n“Yes, I wish you would,” I said. He went back to his place and said,\r\n“Gentlemen, I have talked with Mr. Clews, and he d-d-desires me t-to ask\r\nyou t-to excuse him f-from making a speech on th-th-this occasion and\r\ni-if you w-will d-d-do so, he w-will w-write you a l-letter.”\r\n\r\nTo show the rapid fluctuations that take place in Wall Street, and how\r\neven the best judges of the market are often mistaken in their\r\nprognostications, I will note an instance in connection with Mr.\r\nTravers. On his return from Europe, which was early in July, 1885, when\r\nthe market on this side was weak, cables prior to his departure\r\nevidently indicated to him that much lower figures were in order. Just\r\nprior to the arrival of the steamer, in conversing with an associate\r\nmember of the Exchange, he said, “B-b-barnes, I’ll make a l-l-little\r\nb-b-bet with you; I’ll b-b-bet you L-l-lackawanna will b-b-be under\r\nsix-ty when we r-reach New Y-York.” Barnes was not willing to make the\r\nbet, however, but on their arrival, which was two days after, nothing\r\nsurprised Mr. Travers so much as to find Lackawanna 110 instead of the\r\nfigure 60 or less which he had predicted, especially as its advance did\r\nnot cease thereafter until it sold at 130.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly said, that if a man will wear a good looking hat, and\r\ngood, well polished boots, the head and feet being the parts which first\r\ncatch the eye of an observer, it matters very little what kind of\r\nmaterial the coat, vest and trousers may be made of, if they are whole\r\nand kept clean. Though they may be threadbare the man will appear to be\r\nfairly dressed, and will look much younger than if he were careless\r\nregarding the covering of his extremities. If the latter are fairly\r\nadorned he can pass muster.\r\n\r\nKnowing this fact, I had always been in the habit of posing before the\r\npublic as a youth. In this I was materially assisted by having no hair\r\non the top of my head, in the place where other people’s hair usually\r\ngrows. I had been this way for twenty years, just presenting about the\r\nsame appearance as when I was born, and it has always been a matter of\r\nremark how youthful I looked.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked what I did to keep myself looking so young. My\r\ntruthful answer always has been that, “Virtue is its own reward.” This\r\ntheory invariably passed as sound in my case until it was knocked into a\r\ncocked hat by Travers. One unlucky day he removed the mask, and changed\r\nthe current of public opinion against me on the much cherished subject\r\nof my perpetual bloom of youth.\r\n\r\nIt occurred in this way. Frank Leslie’s _Illustrated Weekly_ had\r\npublished a number of pictures of the active business men of New York,\r\nwho were known in the community as self-made men, and mine was among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA few days after the appearance of my picture in this paper, I happened,\r\none afternoon, on my way uptown, to drop into the Union Club, and as\r\nusual, went into the main room. It was full of members, largely composed\r\nof a scattering of Wall Street bankers and brokers.\r\n\r\nTravers was present, and when he is on hand on such occasions, it always\r\nmeans laughter for the multitude at some one’s expense. In this instance\r\nit happened to be at mine.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the room, Travers said, in an audible voice: “Hallo, boys!\r\nhere comes Clews, the self-made man.” Then, addressing himself to me, he\r\nsaid: “I s-s-say, Cl-Cl-Clews, as you are a s-s-self-made man, wh-wh-why\r\nthe d-d-devil didn’t you p-put more h-h-hair on the top of your head?”\r\n\r\nThis story having gone the rounds, as it soon did, drew attention to my\r\nsummer-appareled head, which before that time had enabled me to pass\r\nmyself off as a youngster just striking out at the commencement of life.\r\nThat stroke of Travers’ wit, however, has been the cause of consigning\r\nme ever since to the ranks of the old “fogies.” Now, everybody is\r\nconvinced that my hair, now _non est_, had already come and gone, and\r\nthat my head represents the work of ages.\r\n\r\nThis is another vivid instance illustrating the saying that “many a\r\ntruth is spoken in jest.”\r\n\r\nWhen Travers thus removed my mask of adolescence, it made me feel\r\nunhappy for some time, as it really transformed my entire identity, and\r\ndeprived me of that luxury so dear to all the fair sex, and to many of\r\nmy own, of sailing under false colors in reference to my age.\r\n\r\nStill, as Travers is such a righteous, good fellow, I have had to\r\nforgive him, notwithstanding the gravity of the offense in having hurt\r\nthe most tender part of my sensitive nature. So we can make up and\r\nbecome friends again, as I value the renewal of his friendship even at\r\nthe cost of such a great personal sacrifice as the deprivation of my\r\nsupposed youthfulness.\r\n\r\nOn the principle that misery loves company, and as Mr. Travers had\r\nbrought misery to my lot by drawing public attention to my bare head, I\r\nfound consolation, shortly afterwards, in a huge joke that the same\r\nfacetious individual perpetrated upon another member of the Club, who\r\nhappened to be one of New York’s most celebrated lawyers. This\r\ngentleman, it is well known, has been connected with some of the largest\r\nand most remunerative railroad cases in our courts for many years, and\r\nbeing considered a great authority in that branch of legal lore, he was\r\naccustomed to exact his own terms from his wealthy clients, which meant,\r\nin most instances, a very fat fee. This gentleman was standing on the\r\nside of the street opposite the Club one afternoon, while Travers was\r\nsurrounded by a cluster of club men on the other side. “Look across the\r\nway, boys,” observed Travers, “th-th-there’s B-B-Barlow with his hands\r\nin his own p-p-pockets at last.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when Travers, who resides at Newport in the summer,\r\nand is the possessor of a small-sized yacht there, which he obtained\r\nsome years ago in lieu of a debt, was taking a refreshing sail on his\r\nyacht in the bay one morning, it happened that a squadron of yachts\r\nappeared in his vicinity, and there was going to be a race. Travers\r\nhaving been made acquainted with the fact, invited a party of friends to\r\ngo to see the race. As soon as it became known to the yachtsmen that the\r\nrenowned Travers had appeared on the deck of his yacht, a committee was\r\nassigned to convey to him the respects of the members of the squadron.\r\nWhen they came alongside his craft he invited them on board, and saw at\r\na glance that they nearly all happened to be bankers and brokers.\r\nCasting his eyes across the glittering water, he beheld a number of\r\nbeautiful white-winged yachts in the distance, and finding, by inquiry,\r\nthat they all belonged to Wall Street well known brokers, he appeared\r\nthereby to be thrown momentarily into a deep reverie, and, without\r\nturning his gaze from the handsome squadron, finally asked his\r\ndistinguished visitors, “wh-wh-where are the cu-cu-customers’ yachts?”\r\n\r\nComment would be entirely superfluous.\r\n\r\nA. T. Stewart, the world renowned retail dry goods merchant, was\r\nelected, on one occasion, to preside at a meeting of citizens during the\r\nwar period, Travers being amongst the number present. When Mr. Stewart\r\ntook his gold pencil case from his pocket and rapped with its head on\r\nthe table for the meeting to come to order, Travers called out, in an\r\naudible tone, “C-cash!” which brought down the house, and no one laughed\r\nmore heartily than Mr. Stewart, although it was a severe thrust at\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAs it is sometimes said of a stranger who comes from a foreign country,\r\nTravers came to New York well recommended, bringing letters of\r\nintroduction with him from the first families of Baltimore, and\r\ncredentials which at once established his status and reputation. So it\r\nwas not necessary for him to remain long on probation in New York.\r\nComing here was not a new birth to him, although, in some measure, he\r\nmay be said to have risen, Phœnix-like, from the ashes of his former\r\nself, as business misfortunes had overtaken him in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nTravers had not only to start in a new place and in a new business when\r\nhe came here, but he had to begin the ascent of his prosperous career at\r\nthe very bottom of the financial ladder. Owing to his incomparable\r\ngeniality he met with hosts of friends from the very start, and he\r\nprospered from the word “go.”\r\n\r\nTravers formed several partnerships at various times. After making\r\nconsiderable money in the one above alluded to with Mr. Jerome, the\r\npartnership was dissolved, and Travers then continued business alone as\r\na Wall Street operator, and as I have formerly stated, usually acted on\r\nthe bear side of the market, which was remarkable for a person of such a\r\nbuoyant and hopeful disposition.\r\n\r\nIn his business operations Mr. Travers has always shown great sagacity,\r\nmingled with caution, and his prestige as a leader became so great that\r\nhe soon attracted a numerous following of operators, who, with their\r\neminent leader, formed a set widely known in speculative circles all\r\nover this country as the “Twenty-third Street Party.” Of this party, Mr.\r\nAddison Cammack, the celebrated bear, was a prominent member, and a\r\ngreat admirer of Mr. Travers.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers was well-born and received a good education, with an\r\nexcellent training for a business career. He married a daughter of the\r\nHon. Reverdy Johnson, who was United States Minister to England during\r\nthe administration of Andrew Johnson, and who was one of the most\r\nprominent members of the Bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers has always been famous for his attachment to out-door sports\r\nand amusements, and on the principle that water finds its level, so did\r\nMr. Travers in the sporting world. He soon became President of the\r\nJerome Jockey Club, President of the Racquet Club, President of the\r\nAthletic Club, and was thoroughly identified as a leader in the large\r\nmajority of manly and out-door sports, in which the youth of New York\r\ncity and its suburbs were interested.\r\n\r\nIt is due both to Mr. Travers and his quondam partner, the renowned\r\nLeonard W. Jerome, to state that the efforts of these two men have been\r\nchiefly instrumental in elevating the social and moral tone of the\r\nrace-course in this part of the country, and raising it to a standard of\r\nrespectability, to which before their reformatory efforts it was\r\npartially a stranger. It was, in a great measure, through their\r\nexertions that the race-track became a fashionable resort, in the North,\r\nfor ladies, as it had been in the South for many years, especially in\r\nKentucky. The ladies of the present day can now talk horse at Jerome\r\nPark, Sheepshead Bay and Long Branch with a volubility that twenty years\r\nago would have shocked their mothers, and would still cause their\r\ngrandmothers to have epileptic fits. So the ladies of the present\r\ngeneration are greatly indebted to these two gentlemen for having\r\nremoved the social stigma from the turf, in this section, thus enabling\r\nthe fair sex to enjoy, in common with the lords of creation, and without\r\ncompunction and loss of dignity, one of the greatest pleasures in the\r\nwhole range of out-door recreations.\r\n\r\nThe breed of horses has been improved to an extent that leaves the\r\nfamous Arabian steed of yore, that outstripped the flight of the\r\nostrich, far in the distance. This development in speed has been brought\r\nto its highest pitch in Harry Bassett, and Wm. H. Vanderbilt’s fondly\r\ncherished Maud S., now the property of Mr. Robert Bonner. For this\r\nimmense evolution in speed and staying powers the patrons of the turf\r\nare largely indebted to Jerome and Travers.\r\n\r\nOne of Travers’ best _bon mots_ was inspired by the sight of the Siamese\r\nTwins. After carefully examining the mysterious ligature that had bound\r\nthem together from birth, he looked up blankly at them and said,\r\n“B-b-br-brothers, I presume.”\r\n\r\nAmong Travers’ contemporaries, Mr. Charles L. Frost was very well known\r\na few years ago. His specialty was purchasing the junior securities of\r\nforeclosed railroads which were supposed to be wiped out, so far as any\r\nvisible element of value was concerned.\r\n\r\nThen, at a time when it was quite inconvenient for the reorganized\r\ncompanies, he would pounce down upon them with some sort of vexatious\r\nlitigation, and would often levy on the bank balances of these\r\ncorporations as a part of his proceedings and peculiar methods of\r\nmanagement. He was enabled to take such action as they were foreign\r\ncorporations. In this way he made it exceedingly difficult for these\r\ncorporations to defend the various suits in law engineered by him, and\r\nrendered their existence exceedingly uncomfortable by placing their\r\nmoney in a tight place and cutting off the interest.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar methods of financiering identified Mr. Frost in a measure\r\nwith Wall Street men, as a character whom most of the bankers and\r\nbrokers who had any dealings with him have had good reason to remember\r\nfeelingly. Frost had bushy, white curly hair, a beardless, full face,\r\nand a very red nose, which could only be acquired at considerable\r\nexpense or as the result of chronic dyspepsia. There is no evidence,\r\nhowever, that he was a victim of this natural malady, so his\r\nhighly-colored proboscis must be accounted for in some other way.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers met this gentleman one morning by accident in a Fourth\r\nAvenue railroad car going down town. Although formerly acquainted, they\r\nhad not met in years, and time, as indicated by his white locks, was\r\nbeginning to tell upon Mr. Frost.\r\n\r\nThis attracted the attention of Mr. Travers, who cordially shook hands\r\nwith the old gentleman, and after making a rapid survey of his person,\r\nsaid, “Wh-why, Mr. Frost, wh-wh-what beautiful white hair you have; what\r\na su-su-superb blue n-n-necktie you wear; what a m-m-mag-magnificent red\r\nnose you have got. If I had s-s-seen you as I do now in w-w-war times, I\r\nshould have taken you for a p-p-perfect p-p-patriot, red white and\r\nblue.”\r\n\r\n                         THE DEATH OF TRAVERS.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reminiscences of Travers were written and stereotyped\r\nwhile the great wit and financier was still alive. I have, therefore,\r\nnot deemed it necessary to recast the matter, but consider it sufficient\r\nto add a few of the salient points in Mr. Travers’ character and career,\r\nwith more _bons mots_ which the death of this popular man brought out.\r\nHe died in Bermuda, March 19, 1887. He had gone there in the previous\r\nNovember, where he had a residence of his own, in the hope that the\r\nclimate might restore him to health, but the malady, diabetes, had got\r\ntoo far ahead, and, in spite of the best medical skill, carried him over\r\nto the majority. His wit, like that of Tom Hood, did not forsake him\r\neven in his last hours.\r\n\r\nWhile on his death-bed at Bermuda a friend called to see him, and said,\r\n“What a nice place Bermuda is for rest and change.” Travers replied:\r\n“Y-y-yes, th-the waiters g-g-get th-th-the ch-change and th-the\r\nh-h-hotel k-k-keepers th-the r-r-rest.”\r\n\r\nAmong Travers’ famous hits the following is one of the best: Jim Fisk’s\r\nzenith of glory and grandeur was in the vicinity of its height when he\r\nsecured the control of the Boston & Providence line of steamboats. He\r\nconstituted himself Commodore, and was always on the deck as they\r\ndeparted each day, dressed in a Commodore’s attire, and was evidently\r\nvery much elated in being supreme in command in connection with these\r\nmagnificent steamboats. Jay Gould was, financially, equally interested\r\nwith him in the venture, and Commodore Fisk, in his usual splurgy\r\nmanner, had a large likeness of both Gould and himself hung up at the\r\nhead of the stairs leading to the large saloon cabin on each of these\r\nsteamboats. Travers and others, who at that time were leading magnates\r\nof the street, were invited to inspect one of these large boats that had\r\nbeen newly fitted up, gilded, and put in magnificent shape, with a band\r\nof music on board, etc. Fisk met Travers as he went on board, and\r\nvolunteered to escort him over the boat to show him its magnificence and\r\nsuperb appointments. As they went up the stairs and came to the first\r\nlanding, he pointed out the likenesses of Fisk and Gould that were hung\r\nthere, and asked Travers if he didn’t think they were good. Travers\r\nreplied: “I th-think th-th-they are v-v-very good, b-b-b-but t-to m-make\r\nth-th-them c-c-complete, th-there sh-sh-should b-b-be a p-p-picture of\r\nour S-S-S-Saviour in th-th-the m-middle.”\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Mr. Travers down town he called at my office. After\r\nhe ran his eye over the stock quotations, I said: “The market is pretty\r\nstiff, Travers.” He said: “Y-yes, it is th-the st-st-stiffness of\r\nd-d-death;” and, sure enough, in the course of two or three days\r\nafterwards, a big smash took place.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers once said to a friend: “C-come and see me in S-September. If\r\ny-you wish I will give you a p-point that will m-make m-money. He wished\r\nto do the man a favor in return for a kindly office. Late in the month\r\nmentioned the friend dropped into Travers’ office.\r\n\r\n“C-come for that p-point?” asked Mr. Travers.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied the friend.\r\n\r\n“Well, y-you are the luckiest d-dog I know. I p-played that p-point two\r\nweeks ago myself and lost a pile of money. Y-you st-stick to m-me l-long\r\nenough and c-close enough, and I’ll l-land y-you in the p-poorhouse,\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nWhen “Plunger” Walton was in the height of his prosperity on the turf he\r\nmet Travers at Saratoga.\r\n\r\n“I have been anxious to see you for some time,” said Walton. “I think we\r\ncan do business together,” he added. “I’ve got good judgment on horses\r\nand horse racing, and you have the same on stocks and stock speculation.\r\nI’ve made $350,000 on horse races in the last two years. Now, you give\r\nme points on stocks, and I’ll give you points on races. Is it a go?”\r\n\r\n“Y-you’ve made three h-hundred and f-fifty th-thousand dollars on\r\nh-horse racing?” Travers repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you want m-me to g-give you p-points on st-stocks?”\r\n\r\n“In exchange for my points on horses. Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll give you a f-first rate p-point. If you’ve made that much in\r\ntwo y-years, st-stick to your b-b-business. It is a f-first-rate\r\np-point.”\r\n\r\nOne day, many years ago, Mr. Travers was standing on the curb of New\r\nstreet, opposite the Exchange, buying some stock from a gentleman whose\r\naspect was unmistakably of the Hebrew stamp.\r\n\r\n“Wh-wh-what is your name?” asked Travers.\r\n\r\n“Jacobs,” responded the seller.\r\n\r\n“B-b-but wh-what is your Christian name?” reiterated Travers.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew was non-plussed, and the crowd was convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe first time Mr. Travers attempted to find Montague street, in\r\nBrooklyn, he lost his way, although he was near the place. Meeting a man\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“I desire to r-reach M-montague st-street. W-will you b-be kik-kind\r\nenough to pup-point the way?”\r\n\r\n“You-you are go-going the wrong w-way,” was the stammering answer. “That\r\nis M-montague st-street there.”\r\n\r\n“Are y-you mimick-mimicking me, making fun of me-me?” asked Mr. Travers\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n“Nun-no, I assure you, sir,” the other replied. “I-I am ba-badly\r\naf-flict-flicted with an imp-impediment in my speech.”\r\n\r\n“Why do-don’t y-you g-get cured?” asked Travers, solemnly. “G-go to\r\nDoctor —, and y-you’ll get c-cured. D-don’t y-you see how well I talk?\r\nH-he cu-cured me.”\r\n\r\nThe fortune left by Mr. Travers has been estimated at $3,000,000. He\r\nleft three sons, William B. Travers, John Travers, and Reverdy Travers,\r\nand five daughters, four of whom are married. His only sister is Mrs.\r\nPrince, mother of the late John D. Prince, of Prince & Whitely.\r\n\r\nMr. Travers assisted a large number of young men to go into business,\r\nand helped to give the start in life to several of the most successful\r\nmen in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nHe was charitable, and his secret beneficences are said to have been\r\nnumerous. He enjoyed the wealth he had made in a way that should make\r\nthe majority of millionaires blush with shame at their parsimony. He was\r\na _bon vivant_ of the first water. He maintained five domestic\r\nestablishments on a first-class and luxurious scale, not like a\r\nCaligula, merely for his personal gratification or the pride of\r\nostentation, but rather for the development of those social traits of\r\ncharacter in which he had few equals, and no superior. The great social\r\npride of his life was to make his friends feel happy. He had one of the\r\nbest cellars in New York. His table at any of his residences was not\r\nonly bountiful, but exhibited a menu equal to that at Delmonico’s. His\r\nfavorite wine was Madeira, of which he was a perfect judge. He was very\r\nmoderate, however, both in eating and drink, but would have the best of\r\neverything despite the cost.\r\n\r\nHe was a kind and indulgent father, but was pleased to see his boys\r\nmanifest ample pluck like himself. Apropos of this characteristic, one\r\nof his boys came home one day with a big blackened eye.\r\n\r\n“W-w-w-where d-d-did you g-g-g-get th-th-that?” inquired the father,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“In a f-f-fight, sir,” replied the son, who has a similar impediment in\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\n“D-d-d-did y-y-you w-w-w-whip the other f-f-fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Y-y-yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Q-q-q-quite r-r-right. H-h-h-here’s a d-d-dollar f-f-for y-you. Always\r\nw-w-whip the other f-f-fellow.”\r\n\r\nTravers himself was courageous, tall, and sinewy, and in his younger\r\ndays a great athlete. He was 68 years of age at the time of his death.\r\nHe was a member of twenty-seven clubs, social, political, and athletic.\r\nHe was a Democrat in politics. As to his religious belief, I expect if\r\nhe had been questioned on that he would have given the same answer as\r\nanother eminent man who cut a great figure in this country: “The world\r\nis my country; to do good is my religion.” Travers might have added: “I\r\nalso wish to be the means of creating and diffusing the greatest amount\r\nof social happiness and enjoyment of which humanity is capable.”\r\n\r\nI may conclude by saying of Travers, as an eminent author observed of\r\nhis namesake the divine William, the Bard of Avon, “We ne’er shall see\r\nhis like again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n           CHARLES F. WOERISHOFFER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAREER OF CHARLES F. WOERISHOFFER, AND THE RESULTANT EFFECT UPON\r\n    SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS.—THE PECULIAR POWER OF THE GREAT LEADER OF\r\n    THE BEAR ELEMENT IN WALL STREET.—HIS METHODS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE\r\n    OTHER WRECKERS OF VALUES.—A BISMARCK IDEA OF AGGRESSIVENESS THE\r\n    RULING ELEMENT OF HIS BUSINESS LIFE.—HIS GRAND ATTACK ON THE VILLARD\r\n    PROPERTIES, AND THE CONSEQUENCE THEREOF.—HIS BENEFACTIONS TO\r\n    FAITHFUL FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the death of Charles F. Woerishoffer, Wall Street lost one of the\r\nmost prominent figures which has ever shown up here. Mr. Woerishoffer\r\ndied May 9, 1886. His career is one worthy of study by watchers of the\r\ncourse of speculation in this or any other country. The results of his\r\nlife-work show what can be accomplished by any man who sets himself at\r\nwork upon an idea, and who devotes himself steadily and persistently to\r\na course of action for the development and perfection of the principle\r\nwhich actuates his life. Mr. Woerishoffer possessed peculiar personal\r\nqualities which are denied to most men and to all women. He had the\r\nmagnetic power of impressing people with confidence in the schemes which\r\nhe inaugurated; that is to say, he had the power of organization—the\r\nsame power has made other men great, and will continue to make men great\r\nwho possess it in all walks of life. Notable instances may be cited in\r\nthe cases of Bismarck, Gladstone, Napoleon, Grant, and—coming down to\r\nWall Street proper—Gould, Daniel Drew, old Jacob Little and the\r\nVanderbilts, especially the Commodore, in his superior power of\r\naggressiveness.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Mr. Woerishoffer that he was fortunate. He was\r\nindeed. He was fortunate in the possession of natural ability, and he\r\nhad the aptitude to take advantage of events, and associate\r\ncircumstances and the strength of purpose, and to direct, instead of\r\nfollowing, the operations with which he became connected. He was the\r\nleader of the bear element of the Street—at least he was such during the\r\nperiod which marks his successful operations here. There is no doubt\r\nthat the death of Mr. Woerishoffer was hastened because of the great\r\nstrain of mind growing out of his business transactions. There is one\r\npoint in this connection which has been overlooked by his biographers,\r\nnamely, that his boldness in the magnitude of his dealings was resultant\r\nfrom a careless or non-calculative mind. I do not believe that Mr.\r\nWoerishoffer ever undertook a speculation of any sort until he had\r\ncarefully calculated all the chances _pro_ and _con_, and his success,\r\nremarkable as it was, was largely due to the combination of calculation\r\nand the natural development of business conditions, of which he was a\r\nclose student.\r\n\r\nMr. Woerishoffer’s conception of business principles was iconoclastic to\r\nan intense degree. As a broker, as a business man, as an operator in\r\nstocks, he “believed in nothing;” that is to say, he was a believer in\r\nthe failures of men, and had no faith in the corporations and\r\nenterprises which were organized for the purpose of the development of\r\nthe best interests of the country in which he lived. There is another\r\nview, or another statement of this peculiar feature, of the character of\r\nthis man which may be given in description, and this is illustrative of\r\nthe careful study he made of everything passing along in the lines of\r\nlife with which he was connected. It is this: That Mr. Woerishoffer, by\r\nhis intimate study of the prospects and probabilities of the projected\r\nplans of enterprising Americans, had come to the conclusion that the\r\nmajority of them must fail, and that the first flush of enterprise would\r\nbe changed to a darker shade as time progressed. That is to say, he saw\r\nand knew a great deal of the organization of the railroad schemes which\r\nhave marked the growth of our rapid development in a business way, and\r\nhe judged that the inflated ideas of the projectors must meet with a\r\ncheck as developments were made, and that the earning capacity of the\r\nroads would not equal expectations. Hence he sold the stocks, and sold\r\nthem right and left from the start, and with his followers reaped the\r\nprofits. Woerishoffer never indulged in the _finesse_ of Gould or Henry\r\nN. Smith. He had the German ideas of open fight, and he attacked\r\neverything indiscriminately, losing money sometimes, but making money at\r\nother times, and by his open dash and persistency carried his point.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the successful career of a man of this sort has a\r\ndeleterious effect upon those who follow him in succeeding generations.\r\nIt does not matter how successful the development of the business\r\nindustries of this country may be hereafter, there will always be found\r\nmen who will speculate upon the ruination rather than the success of the\r\nbest interests of the country merely because Charles F. Woerishoffer\r\nlived and made a fortune by his disbelief and his disregard of the\r\ngrowth of the institutions of the country which gave him a home.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer was a wonderful example of the sudden rise and steady and\r\nrapid progress of a man of strong and tenacious purpose, who adheres\r\nwith firmness to one line of action or business. He was born in Germany.\r\nWoerishoffer’s Wall Street career was begun in the office of August\r\nRutten, afterwards of the firm of Rutten & Bond, in which Woerishoffer\r\nsubsequently became Cashier. He left this firm in 1867, and joined M. C.\r\nKlingenfeldt. Mr. Budge, of the firm of Budge, Schutze & Co., in 1868,\r\nbought him a seat in the Stock Exchange. Some time after he entered the\r\nBoard he became acquainted with Mr. Plaat, of the well-known banking\r\nfirm of L. Von Hoffman & Co. Mr. Woerishoffer was entrusted with the\r\nexecution of large orders, especially in gold and Government bonds. At\r\nthat time the trading in these securities was very large. Afterwards\r\nPlaat became an operator himself, and Woerishoffer followed in his\r\nfootsteps as an apt pupil. Eventually he formed the firm of Woerishoffer\r\n& Co., his first partners being Messrs. Schromberg and Schuyler, who\r\nmade fortunes and retired.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer was connected in enormous operations with some of the\r\nmagnates of the street; for instance, James R. Keene, Henry N. Smith, D.\r\nP. Morgan, Henry Villard, Charles J. Osborn, S. V. White, Addison\r\nCammack, and last, though not least, Jay Gould. He was especially on\r\nintimate terms with his great brother bear, Addison Cammack, both\r\nspeculatively and socially. Besides being a bold operator in the street,\r\nWoerishoffer was associated with large railroad schemes, which gave him\r\nthe inside track in speculation. He was connected with the North River\r\nConstruction Company, the Northern Pacific, Ontario & Western, West\r\nShore, Denver & Rio Grande, Mexican National, several of the St. Louis\r\nCompanies, and Oregon Transcontinental. He was originally a rampant bull\r\non these properties until they began to get into trouble, and then he\r\nbecame a furious and unrelenting bear. He smashed and hammered them down\r\nright and left. He soon covered his losses, and began to make enormous\r\nprofits on the short side of the market. On the bonds and stock of the\r\nKansas Pacific, when it became merged in the Union Pacific, it is\r\nsupposed that Woerishoffer cleared over a million dollars.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer, it seems, was one of the first to propose the building of\r\nthe Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. On this enterprise he realized immense\r\nprofits for himself and his friends. The stock rose until it reached\r\n110, and was “puffed” up for higher figures. The public was attracted by\r\nthe brilliant prospects of immense profits on the long side. Mr.\r\nWoerishoffer and friends held large quantities of long stock, but sold\r\nout, and afterwards put out a large line of shorts. The bear campaign\r\nhad Woerishoffer as leader, and, it is said, he succeeded in covering as\r\nfar down as 40, and some even lower. In 1878, when the market began its\r\ngreat boom on account of the resumption of specie payment and the\r\ngeneral prosperity of the country, he organized a combination which\r\nbought stocks largely and sold wheat short. On this deal he made large\r\nprofits, and began to develop into a pretty strong millionaire. He took\r\nadvantage of the shooting of President Garfield, in 1881, together with\r\nhis colleagues, Cammack and Smith, to organize a bear raid on a large\r\nscale, which was probably one of the chief, although somewhat remote,\r\ncauses of bringing about the panic of 1884.\r\n\r\nThe great perspicacity which he had in the deals enumerated failed him\r\nin 1885. He thought, as the wheat crop was small, that wheat would go up\r\nand stocks would go down, but the very reverse occurred. The\r\ndisappointment and depression, very probably, resulting from this\r\nbrought on the aneurism of the heart, which killed the great bear\r\noperator, and his death was a fortunate event for Wall Street.\r\n\r\nOne of the many things which gave Woerishoffer great reputation as a\r\nspeculator, both here and in Germany and England, was the bold stand he\r\ntook in the fight for the control of Kansas Pacific against Jay Gould,\r\nRussell Sage, and other capitalists, railroad magnates and financiers in\r\n1879. He represented the Frankfort investors, and had engaged to sell a\r\nlarge quantity of Denver extension bonds at 80, to the Gould-Sage\r\nsyndicate. The syndicate, however, knowing that they had the controlling\r\ninfluence, declared the contract for 80 off, and “came to the\r\nconclusion, after examining the road-bed, that the bonds were not worth\r\nmore than 70,” and they would not take them at a higher figure.\r\nWoerishoffer then made a grand flank movement on the little Napoleon of\r\nfinance and his able lieutenants. He seemed to be greatly put out that\r\nthey had broken their contract, but did not complain very bitterly. He\r\nimmediately cabled to the English and German bondholders, and soon\r\nsecured a majority of the bonds which the syndicate wanted, and\r\ndeposited them in the United States Trust Company. He then informed the\r\nsyndicate that they could not obtain a single bond under par to carry\r\nout their great foreclosure scheme. It was this circumstance that caused\r\nFrankfort speculators and investors to come so largely into the New York\r\nstock market, and that also made English capital flow in freely,\r\nspeculators throwing off their former timidity. The amount involved in\r\nthe Gould-Sage syndicate deal was about $6,000,000 of bonds, thus\r\nnetting Woerishoffer considerably over a million. This deal at once gave\r\nhim an international reputation as a far-sighted speculator, and this\r\nreputation was gained at the expense of Gould and Sage, owing to their\r\ndisregard of the contract which had been entered into.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer showed great sagacity as a speculator when Henry Villard\r\nput forward his immense bubble scheme in Northern Pacific and the\r\nOregons. Although invited to go into the big deal with other millionaire\r\nspeculators who had taken the Villard bait so freely, Woerishoffer kept\r\nprudently aloof, and looked on the players at the Villard checkerboard\r\nwith equanimity and at a safe distance. He was not then considered of\r\nvery much account by the men of ample means who so freely subscribed\r\n$20,000,000 to the Villard bubble. At the moment when these subscribers\r\nwere so highly elated with the idea that the Villard fancies were going\r\nfar up into the hundreds and, perhaps, the thousands, like the bonanzas\r\nduring the California craze, Woerishoffer boldly sold the whole line\r\n“short.” This was a similar stroke of daring to that which James R.\r\nKeene had perpetrated on the bonanza kings in the height of their\r\ngreatest power and anticipations. The Villard syndicate determined to\r\nsqueeze Woerishoffer out entirely, and for this purpose a syndicate was\r\nformed to buy 100,000 shares of stock. There were various millionaires\r\nand prominent financiers included in the syndicate. These were the\r\nfinancial powers with which Woerishoffer, small in comparison, had to\r\ncontend single-handed. The feat that Napoleon performed at Lodi, with\r\nhis five generals behind him, spiking the Austrian guns which were\r\ndefended by several regiments, was but a moderate effort in war compared\r\nwith that which Woerishoffer was called upon to achieve in speculation.\r\nHe took things very coolly, and with evident unconcern watched the\r\nactions of the syndicate. The latter went to work vigorously, and soon\r\nobtained 20,000 shares of the stock which they required. It still kept\r\nclimbing rapidly, and so elated was this speculative syndicate with the\r\nsuccess of its plans that it clamored for the additional 80,000 shares,\r\naccording to the resolution. The speculators thought they were now in\r\nthe fair way of crushing Woerishoffer, and with a hurrah obtained the\r\n80,000 shares required, but Woerishoffer’s brokers were the men who sold\r\nthem to the big syndicate. It was not long afterwards that the syndicate\r\nfelt as if it had been struck by lightning. In a short time the Villard\r\nfancies began to tumble. The syndicate was in a quandary, but nothing\r\ncould be done. It had tried to crush Woerishoffer. He owed it no mercy.\r\nThe inevitable laws of speculation had to take their course, and the\r\ngreat little bear netted millions of dollars. These events occurred in\r\n1883.\r\n\r\nAfter the Villard disruption, Mr. Woerishoffer became conservative for\r\nsome time, and was a bull or a bear just as he saw the opportunity to\r\nmake money. When the West Shore settlement took place he watched the\r\ncourse of events with a keen eye, and was one of the most prominent\r\nfigures in pushing the upward movement upon the strength of that\r\nsettlement. His profits on the bull side then were immense. After this\r\nhe became a chronic and most destructive bear. The reason he assigned\r\nfor his conversion and change of base was that the net earnings of the\r\nrailroads were decreasing, and did not justify an advance in prices. He\r\npushed his theory to an extreme, making little or no allowance for the\r\nrecuperative powers of the country, and the large bear contingent, which\r\nhe successfully led, seemed to be inspired with his opinions. These\r\nopinions, pushed to the extreme, as they were, had a very demoralizing\r\neffect upon the stock market, and constituted a potent factor in the\r\ndepreciation of all values, throwing a depressing influence on\r\nspeculation, from which it did not recover until many months after Mr.\r\nWoerishoffer’s death. The great bear had wonderful skill in putting\r\nother operators off the track of his operations by employing a large\r\nnumber of brokers, and by changing his brokers and his base of action so\r\noften that speculators were all at sea regarding what he was going to\r\ndo, and waiting in anxiety for the next move. It was considered\r\nremarkable at the time that his death had not a greater influence on the\r\nstock market than this result proved. If he had died a week sooner, his\r\ndeath might have created a panic, for he was then short of 200,000\r\nshares of stock. His short accounts had all been covered before the\r\nannouncement of his death on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer was almost as famous for his generosity as James R. Keene.\r\nIt is said that he made presents to faithful brokers of over twenty\r\nseats, of the value of $25,000 each, in the Stock Exchange. He made a\r\npresent of a $500 horse to the cabman who drove him daily to and from\r\nhis office. He was exceedingly generous with his employes. A short time\r\nbefore his death, feeling that the strain from over-mental exertion was\r\nbeginning to tell on his constitution, he had resolved to visit Europe\r\nfor the purpose of recuperating, but, like most of our great operators,\r\nhe had stretched the mental cords too far before making this prudent\r\nresolve, and he died at the early age of 43. How many valuable lives\r\nwould be prolonged if they would take needful rest in time! The death of\r\nWoerishoffer should be a solemn warning to Wall Street men who are\r\nanxious to heap up wealth too rapidly. His fortune has been variously\r\nestimated at from $1,000,000 to $4,000,000. He left a widow and two\r\nlittle daughters.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer had simply the genius for speculation which is\r\nuncontrollable, irrespective of consequences to others. He had no\r\nintention of hurting anybody, but his methods had the effect of bringing\r\nothers to ruin all the same. He merely followed the bent of his genius\r\nby making money within the limits of the law, and did not care who\r\nsuffered through his operations. All speculation on the bear side\r\ninvolves the same principle. If there is any difference among\r\nspeculators, it only consists in degree. Large transactions, like those\r\nin which Woerishoffer was engaged, are more severely felt by those who\r\nhave the misfortune to get “squeezed;” but it all resolves itself into a\r\nquestion of the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nWoerishoffer’s success in this country seems strange to Americans, but\r\nhow much stranger it must have seemed to the people of his native town\r\nof Henau Hesse-Nassau, where he was born in 1843, in comparative\r\npoverty. John Jacob Astor was one of the first of a considerable number\r\nof Germans to find this country a veritable new El Dorado, where\r\npeasants’ sons, as if by magic, became far wealthier than many of the\r\nnobility whom they had, as boys, gazed upon with awe. Who could have\r\nforeseen such a career for the poor young German, who came to New York\r\nin 1864? He was then in his twenty-first year. He had had some\r\nexperience in the brokerage business in Frankfort and Paris, but he came\r\nhere poor. Addison Cammack, who was to become his ally in many a\r\ngigantic speculation, was then prominent in the South, where he had\r\nfavored the cause of the people of his State during the war, and had\r\nmade a fortune. D. P. Morgan, who was to be another of his speculative\r\nassociates, had already won a fortune by speculating in cotton in\r\nLondon. Russell Sage counted his wealth by the millions. Jay Gould and\r\nHenry N. Smith had gone through the feverish excitement of a Black\r\nFriday, and either, in common parlance, could have “bought or sold” the\r\npoor young German. Nevertheless, by strange turns in the wheel of\r\nfortune, he acquired a financial prestige that enabled him to beard the\r\nlion in his den, and snap his fingers at powerful combinations that\r\nsought to ruin him. When Henry Villard demanded his resignation as a\r\ndirector in the Oregon Transcontinental Company, on the ground that he\r\nhad been selling the Villard properties short, the “Baron” (as\r\nWoerishoffer was often called) tendered it at once, and flung down the\r\ngage of battle in the announcement that he would ruin the head of the\r\nVillard system.\r\n\r\nChas. F. Woerishoffer was slightly built, had a light complexion, was\r\nunder the medium height, and, on the street, might have been taken for a\r\nbank clerk. He showed his inborn love of gaming in many ways. He is said\r\nto have broken a faro bank at Long Branch twice; he would play at\r\nroulette and poker for large stakes. He was kind-hearted and charitable.\r\nAt Christmas his benefactions to clerks and messenger boys were notable.\r\nIn the height of a great speculation he sometimes showed extreme\r\nnervousness, but during the memorable contest with the Villard party he\r\nexhibited the greatest coolness and composure. He was a curious compound\r\nof German phlegm and American nervousness. One of the fortunate events\r\nin his career was his marriage, in 1875, with Miss Annie Uhl, the\r\nstep-daughter of Oswald Ottendorfer, the editor and proprietor of the\r\ngreat German organ of New York, the _Staats Zeitung_, who brought him,\r\nit was understood, a fortune of about three hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe following circular to my customers, which I published May 13th,\r\n1886, with special reference to the death of Woerishoffer, and its\r\nconsequences, I think is worthy of reproduction here:\r\n\r\n“The future of the market is going to be a natural one, and will go up\r\nand down from natural causes; when this is fully realized there will be\r\nno lack of the public taking a hand in it. That element has been crowded\r\nout of Wall Street for a long time past, largely due to the fact that\r\nits judgment to predicate operations has been sat on by brute force. It\r\nhas been, therefore, made to feel that the market was not one where it\r\nwas safe to venture. This brute force power came from Woerishoffer, who\r\nhas for a long time past been the head and front as a leader on the bear\r\nside, and was a gigantic wrecker of values. His method was to destroy\r\nconfidence and hammer the vitality out of every stock on the list which\r\nshowed symptoms of life, and his power was the more potential, as all\r\nthe room traders were converted to believe in him and were his\r\nfollowers. His decease leaves, therefore, the entire bear fraternity\r\nwithout any head, and consequently in a state of demoralization, and in\r\na condition not unlike a ship at sea without a rudder. Mr. Woerishoffer\r\nwas a genial, hospitable man, lovely in character at his own home, true\r\nto his friends and generous to a fault, and will, therefore, be a great\r\nloss as a gentleman; but so far as the prosperity of the country goes,\r\nhis death will be the country’s gain. To the fact that Mr.\r\nWoerishoffer’s power and influence are no longer felt on the market is\r\nalmost entirely due the change of front of the situation, which is now\r\none of hopefulness. While he lived the public and half the members of\r\nthe Board were completely terrorized by the fear of him, and were kept\r\nin check from being buyers, however much the position of affairs\r\nwarranted going on the long side. The bull side of the market has had\r\nfor a long time past to contend with the bold and ferocious attitude of\r\nMr. Woerishoffer. When the bulls felt justified in making a rally and\r\nforcing the market to go their way, when it looked most encouraging, as\r\na result of their efforts, Mr. Woerishoffer would strike their specialty\r\na sledge hammer blow on the head; he would repeat that on every attempt\r\nthat was made, which finally resulted in discouragement. If ten thousand\r\nshares were not ample for that purpose, he would quadruple the quantity;\r\nin fact, he has often been known to have outstanding contracts on the\r\nshort side of the market amounting to 200,000 shares of stock at least.\r\nAs an operator he seemed to be so peculiarly constituted as to know no\r\nfear, and would often turn apparent defeat to success by possessing that\r\ntrait of character. It will be a long time before another such\r\ndetermined and desperate man will appear on the stage to take his place;\r\nin the meantime, it will be plainer sailing in Wall Street, besides\r\nsafer for operators. Mr. Woerishoffer, as an operator, was full of\r\nexpedients. He put his whole soul into his operations, and not only\r\nwould he attack the stock market with voraciousness, but he would\r\nmanipulate every quarter where it would aid him; sometimes it would be\r\nin the grain market, sometimes by shipping gold, and sometimes by the\r\nmanipulation of the London market. He had all the facilities for\r\noperation at his fingers’ ends, in fact he commanded the situation to\r\nsuch an extent as to make his power felt. Mr. Cammack, Mr.\r\nWoerishoffer’s associate, while usually a bear, is a very different man\r\nand not to be feared, for that gentleman usually sells stocks short only\r\non reliable information, and always to a limited extent. If he finds\r\nthat the market does not go down by the weight of sales, he soon\r\nextricates himself at the first loss. In this method of doing business\r\nlies his safety. In this way he will sell often 10, 20 or 30 thousand\r\nshares of stock and make the turn, but will not, like his late friend\r\nWoerishoffer, take a position and stand by it through thick and thin,\r\nand browbeat the market indefinitely until it finally goes his way. At\r\nthe present time, therefore, the bulls have no great power to fear\r\nwhenever they have merit upon which to predicate their operations. The\r\nfuture will be brighter for Wall Street speculators and investors than\r\nit has been for a long period, and with the public who may be expected\r\nto come again to the front, greatly increased activity should be the\r\nresult.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n             WOMEN AS SPECULATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nWALL STREET NO PLACE FOR WOMEN.—THEY LACK THE MENTAL EQUIPMENT.—FALSE\r\n    DEFENSES OF FEMININE FINANCIERS.—THE CLAFLIN SISTERS AND COMMODORE\r\n    VANDERBILT.—FORTUNE AND REPUTATION ALIKE ENDANGERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs speculators, women hitherto have been utter failures. They do not\r\nthrive in the atmosphere of Wall Street, for they do not seem to have\r\nthe mental qualities required to take in the varied points of the\r\nsituation upon which success in speculation depends. They are, by\r\nnature, parasites as speculators, and, when thrown upon their own\r\nresources, are comparatively helpless. Although they are able, through\r\ncraft and subtlety, to rule the male sex to a large extent, yet, when\r\nobliged to go alone, they are like a ship at sea in a heavy gale without\r\ncompass, anchor or rudder. They have no ballast apart from men, and are\r\nliable to perish when adversity arises. When some of our strong-minded\r\nwoman’s-righters read this—and I hope for this honor from them—I can\r\nimagine certain of them launching epithets of scorn against my head, and\r\neven charging me with dense ignorance regarding the history of the great\r\nwomen of the world, and the wonderful achievements of some of them. They\r\nwill, no doubt, cite Joan of Arc against me; Queen Elizabeth, Catharine\r\nof Russia, the unfortunate and beautiful Mary, Queen of Scots, _et al._\r\nWomen, in general, rarely summon beautiful women in their own cause, but\r\nin this case they will probably do so; for it is a trick of the sex to\r\nbring feminine beauty to play as a tramp card when man is the game.\r\n\r\nThe wife of John Stuart Mill, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Julia Ward\r\nHowe, and a host of other great female reformers and revolutionists\r\nwill, without doubt, be quoted against my theory. Several of the\r\nstrong-minded novelists and their chief works will be cited to show how\r\nunfounded is my charge. Ouida, George Elliot, and George Sand will\r\nprobably be arrayed in judgment against me. The one answer to all this\r\nmust be that such women are the exceptional cases, which prove the rule\r\nand sustain my theory. Besides, these fair ones, with the exception of\r\nOuida, and, to some extent, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and possibly, George\r\nSand, have never tried their hands at speculation. They have excelled in\r\ntheir particular lines, but when all their secret history is known, it\r\nwill be found that men were the source of their inspiration. I am aware\r\nthat the opposite theory is held, through false gallantry; but the\r\nchivalrous knights who credit the fair sex with more speculative brains\r\nthan they possess are in a petty minority, and will always remain so as\r\nlong as men have manhood enough to decide according to their judgment\r\ninstead of their emotions.\r\n\r\nFact is the best test on this question, and I will recite a few facts in\r\nthe history of some of the female speculators of Wall Street, quite\r\naware that I touch a very delicate subject. The namby-pambyism and the\r\npseudo “gallantry” now so prevalent, are generally opposed to any fair\r\nstatement in regard to woman’s real financial capacity, and, worse than\r\nall, woman’s true interests and functions are greatly aspersed and\r\nprejudiced by these false sentiments. When carried away, as she so often\r\nis, by the insidious flatteries of man and the showy frivolities of\r\nfashion, a woman is rendered temporarily blind to these important facts;\r\nbut, in the exceptional instances, where she reasons calmly and reflects\r\nprudently, she pays the greatest respect to those of our sex who\r\ndispense plain advice and blunt opinions. Dudes and designing flatterers\r\nmay revel for a time in their conquests, but the opinions of men of\r\njudgment, honesty and virtue will eventually triumph with those of the\r\nother sex who are most discerning.\r\n\r\nLet me, then, illustrate my estimate of women as speculators by a few of\r\nthe more prominent examples I have known in Wall Street, who have\r\nessayed to make a fortune after the manner of men. I shall take up the\r\npresent Lady Cooke and her sister, Mrs. Woodhull. Lady Cooke has now a\r\nvirtual “castle in Spain,” or rather in Portugal, besides one of the\r\nmost elegant mansions in London. My knowledge of the history of those\r\nsisters and their financial relations and business connections with the\r\nlate Commodore Vanderbilt, go to illustrate the fact very clearly that\r\nthe cleverest women cannot be successful in Wall Street; and if this is\r\nso, where will the ordinary female be found when she essays the role of\r\nan operator?\r\n\r\nThe notorious firm of Woodhull, Claflin & Co., in their peculiar\r\ncombination, included Commodore Vanderbilt. I shall say something about\r\ntheir methods of operation before touching upon the history and\r\nbiography of the two sisters, which is remarkable in the extreme. Very\r\nsoon after the Commodore had aided to set these two women up as brokers,\r\nin Broad Street, the firm was known all over the land. The present\r\ntitled Lady Cooke was then plain Tennie C. Claflin, and she was plain in\r\nevery sense of the word, excepting in face, which certainly was quite\r\npretty. She had, however, less personal magnetism than her celebrated\r\nsister, Victoria C. Woodhull, but doubtless made more impression on a\r\nwell-known journalist of this city and upon the Commodore than any one\r\nelse, until she met Sir — Cooke. Tennie was rather phlegmatic in\r\ntemperament, and could therefore exercise but little influence over the\r\nordinary man, but she was cool and calculating, and had evidently more\r\nbrain than she seemed to possess. She could wear a winning smile, but it\r\nwas manifestly put on for the occasion.\r\n\r\nI recollect her calling at my office one afternoon. After the usual\r\ninterchange of civilities, she told me she wished to deposit a check for\r\n$7,000. The check was signed by the wealthiest man in Wall Street, and\r\nwas promptly accepted by my cashier, and duly credited. A few days after\r\nthis event, Miss Tennie drove up to my office in a cab. She wore a look\r\nof enthusiasm and pleasant surprise. In her countenance one could read\r\nat a glance that she had a heavy thought to divulge. So she said she had\r\na “point.” I don’t care for “points” as a rule, but I was bound by all\r\nthe laws of chivalry and business courtesy to give the lady a respectful\r\nhearing, and I did. The point had emanated from a very high source, and\r\nfor that reason, also, was entitled to respectful consideration. The\r\ncharming Tennie wanted to buy 1,000 shares of New York Central. Though\r\nalways on the alert for business, I was not then at all anxious to\r\nexecute the lady’s order. I received Miss Claflin with all due respect,\r\nand without giving her any intimation that I perceived, by my peculiar\r\ninspiration, “the gentleman in the fence,” I tapped my little bell, to\r\nwhich my office messenger responded. “Tell the cashier,” I said, “to\r\nmake out Miss Tennie Claflin’s account.” This was simply the work of a\r\nfew minutes, and Miss Tennie was instantly furnished with a check,\r\nincluding interest for the time of deposit. Miss Claflin bowed herself\r\nout, and I heaved a sigh of relief, and thought that everything was over\r\nso far as that check was concerned. But I was slightly mistaken.\r\n\r\nTennie went to the Fourth National Bank immediately, and presented the\r\ncheck. She returned to my office in a few minutes afterwards. P. C.\r\nCalhoun was then President of the Fourth National. When Tennie returned,\r\nshe said, “Mr. Clews, the bank wishes to have me identified.” I called a\r\nboy and told him to accompany Miss Claflin to the bank, and identify her\r\nas being entitled to the amount of the check. This sealed her credit for\r\nthat amount at the bank, owing to which I obtained the rather doubtful\r\ndistinction of having been made the medium of largely aiding to\r\nestablish the firm of Woodhull & Claflin in Broad street. Myself and the\r\nFourth National Bank were said to have been the “sponsors” for this\r\nconsummation. As soon as I ascertained how my name was being connected\r\nwith those ladies, I had a private interview with the President of the\r\nFourth National, which prevented Tennie from using my name to a great\r\nextent thereafter. I have never attempted to take any credit to myself\r\nfor this affair, but there is one thing evident, and that is, that I did\r\nnot get euchred in the matter. The Commodore was then regarded as the\r\npower behind the throne, or behind the fair sex. If the sisters had any\r\nscheme in the background (and I have reason to believe they had,) I did\r\nnot get caught in it.\r\n\r\nFar be it from my purpose to insinuate that these celebrated “sisters”\r\nare a sample of all the women who intrude into speculative circles.\r\nThese facts, however, show by what sort of methods two of the most\r\nnotorious female speculators of these times gained their success. It\r\nwould be an aspersion on womanhood to suppose that many women would be\r\nfound willing to resort to like methods; but it is safe to say that, as\r\na rule, women can have little other hope of success than by using their\r\nblandishments to win the attentions and the services of the other sex.\r\nThere are doubtless exceptions to this rule, as in the case of Mrs.\r\nGreen, whose unaided sagacity has placed her among the most successful\r\nof our millionaire speculators. She is, however, made up of a powerful\r\nmasculine brain in an otherwise female constitution, and is one among a\r\nmillion of her sex.\r\n\r\nIf women are fortunate enough to escape being fleeced when they enter\r\nWall Street, it can only be from extraordinary luck, or from the\r\nprotecting counsel of their brokers, or from compassionate indulgence\r\nshown to them when swamped by their losses. My own experience shows that\r\nwhen they lose their money—as they usually do—they are by no means\r\nsparing in their pleas for consideration; and this fact shows that women\r\nwho aspire to this path to fortune are not usually endowed with the\r\nself-respect, the modesty and the independence of masculine favors which\r\ncharacterize all high-minded women. In truth, this is so well understood\r\namong the habitués of Wall Street, that while a woman who frequents\r\nbrokers’ offices is not likely to find any lack of attentions, yet she\r\nis sure to lose caste among those who bestow such gallantries. In a\r\nword, Wall Street is not the place for a lady to find either fortune or\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by Mrs. Victoria Woodhull —— is somewhat different\r\nfrom the statement herein made by me in reference to the establishment\r\nof the brokerage firm, run ostensibly by the famous sisters; and as this\r\ncelebrated lady shows in some of her recent utterances that she has done\r\nso much for humanity, truth, and financial reform, her statement is\r\nentitled to fair presentation. I shall, therefore, give it in full. It\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n“The first move my sister and I made in this direction was to establish\r\na banking and brokerage office in Broad street. This step we were\r\ninduced to take with the view of proving that woman, no less than man,\r\ncan qualify herself for the more onerous occupations of life. So\r\nstartling was this innovation that the whole city of New York was\r\naroused, and when we entered the precincts of Wall and Broad streets\r\nthey were blocked with crowds of people until the novelty wore away. But\r\nto-day women can establish themselves in any business, enter any avenue\r\nof life that they are qualified through education to fill, either\r\npolitical, financial, scientific, medical or mechanical, so great is the\r\nadvance. At that time, as some of the New York papers said, everything,\r\nto the external view, was at the height of prosperity. But we exposed,\r\nin our _Weekly_, one nefarious scheme after another when we realized\r\nthat companies were floated to work mines that did not exist, or that,\r\nif they did exist, had nothing in them, and to make railways to nowhere\r\nin particular, and that banks and insurance societies flourished by\r\ndevouring their shareholders’ capital. The papers of 1872 said that in\r\none year we had exposed and destroyed nearly every fraudulent scheme\r\nthat was then in operation—railroad swindles and the banking houses\r\nwhich were palming them off on the public. Life insurance companies were\r\nreduced from forty to nineteen for the whole country; the Great Southern\r\nbonds and the Mexican Claim bubbles collapsed. More than one tried to\r\nbuy our silence, and when their money was refused they turned and\r\ncharged us with levying blackmail, and, losing in their rage and fear\r\nall sense of honor, said that we were immoral women or we would not have\r\ncommenced such an undertaking. Other papers took up the warfare. It\r\nbrought about a great revolution in financial matters, but it made us\r\nmany bitter enemies, for we were the first to put ourselves into the\r\nbreach.”\r\n\r\nI shall make no attempt to contradict the bold statement of the lady,\r\nbut simply quote it for what it is worth, leaving the inference to the\r\nreader, as the novelistic phrase goes, but I do hold that the very\r\nresult of the experiment to which she alludes is one of the strongest\r\nand most cogent arguments in favor of my theory, that women are not\r\nqualified by nature for the speculative and financial operations in\r\nwhich so many men have made their mark. Even the few apparent exceptions\r\nto the rule have been sad failures compared with the achievements of the\r\nmale sex in this department of human enterprise. “Jennie June,” the able\r\nand accomplished wife of Mr. Croly, the well-known journalist, has\r\nessayed the speculative role, but she has not been very successful. When\r\nwomen such as these have failed what can the ordinary female expect?\r\nWell, I think they had better abide by the advice of St. Paul in regard\r\nto women speaking in the church. Let them say or do nothing in the\r\npeculiar line for the pursuit of which they are evidently disqualified,\r\nbut if they want to know anything, “ask their husbands at home.” Those\r\nwho have not yet obtained husbands may ask their fathers, brothers or\r\nlovers, and if they do so they will often be saved a world of trouble.\r\n\r\nThere has recently been a curious craze in the ranks of young ladies as\r\nwell as among married women for speculation, many of them thinking they\r\ncould make a fortune in a few days, weeks or months, and it is nearly\r\ntime that this speculative mania should be checked or stopped. Maidens\r\nof uncertain age have probably been foremost in leading this movement,\r\nand through their influence many estimable ladies have been induced to\r\nbring financial trouble upon their husbands and families. Many of the\r\nwoman’s righters think that it would be a glorious thing to follow in\r\nthe footsteps of Victoria Woodhull ——, whom they imagine to have been a\r\nsuccess in that line of business; whereas she was a sad failure. Women\r\nas brokers have singularly failed in every known instance of experience.\r\nVictoria W. has been much more successful as an investor than a\r\nspeculator, and the best investment of her life was that of her last\r\nmarriage. There she made a decided hit. Perhaps, her Wall Street\r\nexperience may have assisted her, in a great measure, to accomplish this\r\nfeat. Compared with her two former marriages, however, her happy union\r\nwith the foreign banker is a decided success. It is probably only in the\r\nmatrimonial line that women can become successful speculators.\r\n\r\nNow, I shall attempt to give some reasons, with all due respect to the\r\nfair sex—and without trying to lower them in the estimation of men—why\r\nthose dear creatures, so necessary to our happiness in many other\r\nrespects, are not by nature, nor even by the best possible education,\r\nqualified to become speculators. Women are too impulsive and\r\nimpressionable. Although they often arrive at correct conclusions in the\r\nordinary affairs of life with amazing rapidity, they don’t reason in the\r\nway that is indispensable to a successful speculator. They jump to a\r\nconclusion by a kind of instinct, or it may be a sort of inspiration, on\r\na single subject or part of a subject, but they are entirely unable to\r\ntake that broad view of the whole question and situation which the\r\nspeculator has to seize at a glance, in the way that Jacob Little, the\r\nelder Vanderbilt, or Daniel Drew could have done, as I have described in\r\nother chapters. Gould possesses many of these qualities, though he has\r\nnever been a speculator like the others, in the ordinary and true sense\r\nof the term, but, as I have clearly shown in another place, made his\r\ngreat fortune by putting two or more wrecked railroads together and\r\nmaking others believe they were good, and selling out on them\r\nafterwards, and not by legitimate speculation or investment.\r\n\r\nWomen who have hitherto engaged in speculation have not yet shown that\r\nthey are capable of generalizing the causes which affect the market as\r\nthese kings of finance have done, nor have they illustrated that they\r\nare possessed of the ability to foresee financial events in the same\r\nway. Some people may think that Mrs. Hettie Green may be an exception to\r\nthe rule, but, without attempting to detract from the abilities of this\r\neminent and wealthy lady, I hardly think she has the mental power of any\r\nof the great operators whom I have named, and though it must be admitted\r\nthat she has done some fine work in manipulating Louisville & Nashville,\r\nI am of the opinion that she would fall very far short of leading a bear\r\nattack on the market like any of those for which the late Charles F.\r\nWoerishoffer was famous, and in organizing a “blind pool” she would\r\nstand no show against Gould, Major Selover, Addison Cammack or James R.\r\nKeene.\r\n\r\nLady Claflin Cook, formerly Tennie C. Claflin, or “Tennessee,” as she\r\nwas baptized, though she had not the intellectual ability of her sister\r\nVictoria, appeared to exercise more influence over Commodore Vanderbilt\r\non account of her greater capacity as a spiritualistic medium. In his\r\nlatter days, as is well known, the Commodore was an implicit believer in\r\nSpiritualism, and considered it expedient to consult mediums in the same\r\nway that the ancient Greeks and Romans went to their oracles, before\r\nengaging in any great enterprise. It is not generally known that the\r\nfallacy of Tennie’s mediumistic powers was exposed by the Christian\r\nBrothers, and her usefulness to the Commodore considerably impaired\r\nthereby in his estimation. This came about through the influence of Mrs.\r\nClaflin, the mother of the celebrated sisters. Her superstition ran so\r\nhigh that she imagined her daughters were possessed of evil spirits\r\nthrough the power of Colonel Blood, Victoria’s second husband. The holy\r\nmen received due credit for exorcising the spirits, thus freeing the\r\nsisters from this mysterious thraldom, and Victoria from Blood. Her\r\ngreat prosperity and that of her sister began from this date, and at the\r\nbeginning of the celebrated case on the part of “young Corneel” to break\r\nthe Commodore’s will the sisters suddenly took a trip to England, lest\r\nthey might be called as witnesses. It was a lucky day for them, and\r\ntheir speculative career is probably now closed. This is the kind of\r\nspeculation for which women are best fitted. The introduction to this\r\ngreat “deal” came through Wall Street indirectly, but it does not prove\r\nby any means that women can be successful operators in speculative\r\ntransactions and financial investments. It simply shows that they are\r\nexcellent in adventures where their emotional feelings are brought to\r\nbear upon the weaker characteristics of men.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n       WESTERN MILLIONAIRES IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTWARD THE STAR OF WEALTH AND THE TIDE OF BEAUTY TAKE THEIR\r\n    COURSE.—INFLUENCE OF THE FAIR SEX ON THIS TENDENCY, AND WHY.—NEW\r\n    YORK THE GREAT MAGNET OF THE COUNTRY.—SWINGING INTO THE TIDE OF\r\n    FASHION.—COLLIS P.

SHAW, SPECULATOR AND LAWYER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a few Western men of wealth have in recent years taken up their\r\nabode in New York. This is partly, and doubtless largely, due to the\r\ninfluence of ladies. The ladies of the West of course have heard of\r\nSaratoga, the far-famed spa of America, and as the fortunes of their\r\nhusbands mount higher and higher into the millions, they become more and\r\nmore anxious to see this great summer resort of wealth and fashion.\r\nTheir influence prevails, and at the height of the gay season they may\r\nbe seen at the United States or the Grand Union. They are in practically\r\na new world. There is the rustle and perfume, the glitter and show, the\r\npomp and circumstance of the more advanced civilization of the East, and\r\nthe ladies, with innate keenness, are quick to perceive a marked\r\ndifference between this gorgeous panorama and the more prosaic\r\nsurroundings to which they have been accustomed. As people of wealth and\r\nsocial position, they are naturally presented to some of the society\r\nleaders of New York, whom they meet at Saratoga, and who extend an\r\ninvitation to visit them in their splendid mansions in the metropolis.\r\nIn New York the Western ladies go to the great emporiums of dry goods\r\nand fancy articles of all sorts, to the famous jewelry stores, and other\r\nretail establishments patronized by the wealthy. They form a taste for\r\nall the elegancies of metropolitan life, and this is revealed in a\r\nhundred little ways.\r\n\r\nThey have been accustomed, for instance, to wearing two buttoned gloves,\r\nbut now, in emulation of their New York sisters, they must have them up\r\nnearly to the shoulder. Their dresses of Western make do not bear\r\ncomparison with the superb toilettes of New York ladies, and so they\r\nseek out the most fashionable modistes in the city, and the change in\r\ntheir appearance is as marked as it is favorable. The innate refinement\r\nand love of elegance which is so striking a characteristic in most\r\nAmerican women is exemplified, perhaps, in no respect more strikingly\r\nthan in their taste in dress, and the Western ladies soon require the\r\nfinest French silks for their dresses. They must have the most expensive\r\nreal lace; their toilettes must be numerous, rich, and varied, and the\r\nrefinements of other articles of dress or ornament to which American\r\nwomen have attained may well astonish and even awe the masculine mind.\r\n\r\nIn a word, people of wealth are apt to be drawn to New York because it\r\nis the great magnet of the country, whose attractive power is well nigh\r\nirresistible. What London is to Great Britain, what Paris is to the\r\nContinent, what Rome was in its imperial day to the Empire, what proud\r\nold Nineveh was to Assyria, the winged lion of the Orient; what Tyre was\r\nto old Syria, whose commercial splendor aroused the eloquence of the\r\nHebrew prophet—New York is to the immense domain of the American\r\nRepublic, a natural stage, set with innumerable villages, towns, and\r\npopulous cities, with mighty rivers and vast stretches of table-lands\r\nand prairies, and far-reaching harvest fields and forests, for the great\r\ndrama of civilization on this Continent. New York has now a population\r\nof approximately 1,500,000. By the close of the present century it will\r\ncertainly reach 2,000,000, and the next century will see it increase to\r\nperhaps ten times that number. The great metropolis attracts by its\r\nrestless activity, its feverish enterprise, and the opportunities which\r\nit affords to men of ability, but in the connection which I am now\r\nconsidering more particularly it attracts as an enormous lode-stone by\r\nits imperial wealth, its Parisian, indeed almost Sybaritic luxury, and\r\nits social splendor.\r\n\r\nNew York city has more wealth than thirteen of the States and\r\nTerritories combined. It is really the great social centre of the\r\nRepublic, and its position as such is becoming more and more assured. It\r\nwill yet outshine London and Paris. Go where we may throughout the\r\ncountry, see what cities we may, there is always something lacking which\r\nNew York readily affords. There is emphatically no place like New York.\r\nHere are some of the finest stores in the world, and mansions of which a\r\nDoge of Venice or a Lorenzo de Medici might have been proud. Here are\r\nthe most beautiful ladies in the world, as well as the most refined and\r\ncultivated; here are the finest theatres and art galleries, and the true\r\nhome of opera is in this country; here is the glitter of peerless\r\nfashion, the ceaseless roll of splendid equipages, and the Bois de\r\nBoulogne of America, the Central Park; here there is a constant round of\r\nbrilliant banquets, afternoon teas and receptions, the germans of the\r\nelite, the grand balls, with their more formal pomp and splendid\r\ncircumstance; glowing pictures of beautiful women and brave men\r\nthreading the mazes of the dance; scenes of revelry by night in an\r\natmosphere loaded with the perfume of rare exotics, to the swell of\r\nsensuous music. It does not take much of this new kind of life to make\r\nenthusiastic New Yorkers of the wives of Western millionaires, and then\r\nnothing remains but to purchase a brown stone mansion, and swing into\r\nthe tide of fashion with receptions, balls, and kettle-drums, elegant\r\nequipages with coachmen in bright-buttoned livery, footmen in top boots,\r\nmaid-servants and man-servants, including a butler and all the other\r\nadjuncts of fashionable life in the great metropolis. It is of interest\r\nto glance at the career, by the way, of some of the more famous\r\nfinancial powers of the West, who have either settled of recent years in\r\nNew York or who are frequently seen here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _C P. Huntington_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON.\r\n\r\nOne of the financiers who may be seen daily entering the palatial Mills\r\nBuilding in Broad street, New York, is a tall, well-built man, with a\r\nfull beard tinged with gray, a square, resolute jaw, and keen\r\nbluish-gray eyes. Though now in his 66th year, his step is light and\r\nquick, betokening good habits in his youth and due care of himself in\r\nhis later years. He is one of the best known of American financial\r\nchieftains. It is Collis P. Huntington. He is a born leader of men. As a\r\nboy of 15 he came to New York, with scarcely a penny. Now he is worth\r\nthirty million dollars. He was born October 22d, 1821, at Harwinton, in\r\nLitchfield county, Connecticut. He numbers among his ancestors Samuel\r\nHuntington, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, who\r\nwas also President of the Continental Congress and Governor and Chief\r\nJustice of Connecticut; and also Bishop F. D. Huntington and the artist\r\nDaniel Huntington. C. P. Huntington’s father was a farmer and small\r\nmanufacturer, in his fourteenth year Huntington left school and asked\r\nhis father to give him his time on condition that he should support\r\nhimself. He came to New York in the following year, 1836, and bought a\r\nsmall bill of goods, a neighbor of his father’s becoming his surety. At\r\nthat early age he showed the same shrewdness in business, the same\r\nenergy and resolution in carrying through his projects as he did in\r\nlater life. At twenty-three he settled at Oneonta, Otsego county, New\r\nYork, as a general merchant. In 1844 he married a Connecticut girl, who\r\nproved a valuable helpmeet in days when it was never supposed he would\r\never attain any particular financial distinction. In March, 1849, he\r\nsailed for San Francisco, going by way of the Isthmus, and following a\r\nconsignment of goods which he had made in the previous year. He was now\r\nin his 28th year, and a future full of marvellous success awaited him.\r\nThis was not immediately apparent, however. Business success is not\r\nusually attained without long and persistent efforts, and in spite of\r\nrepeated discouragements. He found San Francisco at that time a resort\r\nmerely for the idle and the reckless. It did not prove at this\r\nparticular juncture a satisfactory field for his business; his funds ran\r\nlow, and he determined to go to Sacramento. He earned his passage money\r\nthither on a schooner, by helping to load her for a dollar an hour. In\r\nSacramento he started in business, after a time, with a small tent as a\r\nstore, and a limited supply of general merchandise as his stock in\r\ntrade; he worked hard; he labored early and late. Here he met Mark\r\nHopkins, and they formed a business co-partnership, which proved so\r\nsuccessful that by 1856 the firm was known as one of the wealthiest on\r\nthe Pacific slope. California, however, was isolated. It was a long trip\r\nover the plains by wagon trains to the nearest point of commercial\r\nimportance east of the Rocky Mountains, and the ocean voyage by way of\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama was long and slow. A railroad to the East was\r\nimperatively needed, in order to develop the enormous resources of the\r\nbroad territory lying west of that natural barrier known as the Rocky\r\nMountains. But how to bring it about was the question. Few were daring\r\nenough to seriously grapple with the problem. It was in the store of\r\nHuntington & Hopkins that the project was first considered with a\r\nresolute purpose to push it through. The Civil War, however, broke out\r\njust then, and the first gun fired on Fort Sumter seemed like the knell\r\nof this great project. Collis P. Huntington was undaunted. “I will,” he\r\nsays, “be one of the eight or ten, if Hopkins agrees, to bear the\r\nexpense of a careful and thorough survey.” The result was that seven\r\ngentlemen agreed to defray the expense of such a survey. Two\r\nsubsequently ceased to give their aid. The remaining five organized the\r\nCentral Pacific Railroad Company. Mr. Huntington at once went to\r\nWashington to secure Government aid in constructing the first\r\ntrans-continental railway. He was successful. When the Pacific Railroad\r\nbill was passed he telegraphed to his partners with characteristic humor\r\nand terseness: “We have drawn the elephant.” He at once came to New York\r\nto form a syndicate to take the bonds. Many at such a time would have\r\ngone to speculators begging for aid and pledging his bonds for railroad\r\nmaterial with which to commence the great line. He did nothing of the\r\nkind. The French saying, “_Toujours de l’audace_,” seemed to be his\r\nmaxim. He was always bold. He coolly announced that he would not dispose\r\nof his bonds except for cash, and, strange as it may have seemed, he\r\ncapped the climax by refusing to sell any at all unless $1,500,000 worth\r\nwere taken. He was again successful, but the purchaser required more\r\nsecurity. Thereupon Mr. Huntington made himself and his firm responsible\r\nfor the whole amount. It was thus on the pledge of the private fortunes\r\nof Mr. Huntington and his partner that the first fifty miles of the road\r\nwere built. After a time, however, funds ran low; it seemed inevitable\r\nthat the number of laborers should be reduced. Certainly more means were\r\nnecessary. At that time the Government held the first mortgage on the\r\nroad, and no Government subsidy bonds were obtainable until a section of\r\nfifty miles of the road had been completed. Huntington and Hopkins\r\nstepped into the breach, and agreed to keep five hundred men at work for\r\na year at their private expense, and three other gentlemen agreed to\r\nfurnish three hundred men for the same length of time. This resolution\r\nended their troubles; the road was built through to a connection with\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard, and trans-continental transportation became a\r\nfact and no longer a dream. Mr. Huntington came to New York again, and\r\nhere he now resides in a fine mansion on Park avenue. He is still a hard\r\nworker, but after business hours he dismisses as far as possible the\r\ncares of his financial functions. Among the railroad systems controlled\r\nand operated by him and his associates, the executive conduct of which\r\nis largely directed by himself, are the Central Pacific, the Chesapeake\r\n& Ohio, the Trans-Mississippi roads, and the Southern Pacific, making a\r\ntotal of nearly eight thousand miles of line. He is also heavily\r\ninterested in roads in Mexico and Central America and steamship lines\r\nplying to the Chesapeake Bay, to Brazil, China and Japan and other parts\r\nof the world. Directly or indirectly he has thirty thousand men under\r\nhim. In business he is an autocrat; his manner is quick and decisive; he\r\nis direct in his speech, and expresses himself with force when he says\r\nanything. He also knows when silence is golden. He is a good story\r\nteller, and has a large fund of anecdotes; he has original wit, a store\r\nof quaint, homely sayings, which are often singularly apt. Sitting in\r\nhis office chair, with a black skull cap, which he usually wears in\r\nbusiness hours, pushed back on his head, he has an open, jolly,\r\nunassuming look, and the stranger would hardly take him for one of the\r\nuncrowned financial kings of this country. He is one of the few men in\r\nthis country who have shown themselves more than a match for Jay Gould.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Leland Stanford._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LELAND STANFORD.\r\n\r\nLeland Stanford, one of California’s United States Senators, is worth\r\nfrom thirty to forty million dollars. He was born in Albany county, New\r\nYork, March 9, 1824. He received an academical education and entered a\r\nlaw office in Albany in 1846, and, after three years’ study, was\r\nadmitted to practice law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.\r\nHe removed to Port Washington, in the northern part of Wisconsin, and\r\nthere engaged in the practice of his profession for four years. In 1852\r\nfire destroyed his law library and other property, whereupon he went to\r\nCalifornia and became associated in business with his three brothers,\r\nwho had preceded him in seeking fortune on the Pacific Slope. His first\r\nbusiness venture was in Michigan Bluffs, but in 1856 he removed to San\r\nFrancisco to engage in business enterprises on a large scale. His\r\nbusiness at one time, it seems, was in oil, and, later, in various\r\nmanufacturing and agricultural ventures. He was elected Governor of\r\nCalifornia in 1861. He insisted upon being inaugurated as provided by\r\nthe State constitution, at the Capitol building, though the locality was\r\nunder water by reason of floods. He became President of the Central\r\nPacific Railroad and superintended its construction over the mountains,\r\nbuilding 530 miles of it in 293 days. He was elected as a Republican to\r\nthe United States Senate in 1884, and his term does not expire till\r\n1891. He is still the President of the Central Pacific Railroad and of\r\nseveral of its associated lines, while he is a director in others. He\r\nowns a princely domain in California, known as Palo Alto ranch,\r\ncomprising six thousand acres, which he has devoted to the site of an\r\nIndustrial University for both sexes, as a memorial of his only son, who\r\ndied some years ago. He has richly endowed this great educational\r\ninstitution, setting aside for it about ten million dollars. Here both\r\nsexes will be fitted to fill a useful part in the battle of life; they\r\nwill be instructed in mechanical arts and agricultural as well as in\r\nother branches of education, which will start the student fairly in\r\nlife. He found, as President of the Central Pacific Railroad Company,\r\nthat many bright young men of collegiate education were not specially\r\nfitted for any particular work in the great school of life, and those\r\nwho are familiar with great cities know that thousands of men have\r\nreally wasted their years in obtaining a collegiate education which\r\nnever enabled them to earn more than barely enough to live upon. They\r\nbecome, in many cases, ill-paid book-keepers, entry clerks, salesmen,\r\ncar conductors, postmen, and sometimes find themselves obliged to turn\r\ntheir hands to hard manual labor, or else starve. Senator Stanford’s\r\nbeneficent plan, then, of giving the young such a practical education\r\nthat they can face the world with confidence and with a reasonable\r\ncertainty of remunerative employment, or with the requisite knowledge to\r\nguide them in enterprises of their own, is worthy of the highest\r\ncommendation, and his example is likewise worthy of the emulation of\r\ngentlemen with millions to spare in all parts of the country. If Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden had endowed a university of this kind he would have been a far\r\ngreater benefactor in many respects than he has undoubtedly shown\r\nhimself in his will. Governor Stanford’s great ranch, which is to become\r\na seat of learning, is situated about 32 miles from San Francisco, and\r\npromises to be the educational Mecca of the Pacific Slope. His fortune,\r\nnotwithstanding this princely donation, is still enormous, amounting to\r\ntwenty-five or thirty million dollars.\r\n\r\n                            DARIUS O. MILLS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable figures daily seen on Wall Street is a man about\r\nfive feet nine inches in height, with handsome, florid features and a\r\nfirm jaw, indicative of great decision of character. He is now about\r\nfifty eight years of age, and is as industrious and energetic as when he\r\nbegan his eventful career. It is Darius O. Mills. He is one of the most\r\nastute and one of the boldest financiers in this country. He has the\r\ncourage of a Richelieu, joined to that famous statesman’s caution and\r\nconservatism when the march of events requires it. Of the California\r\nmagnates he is one of the most notable. In New York he has taken the\r\nhighest rank, socially and financially, of them all. As I have\r\nintimated, he is bold, and yet, on occasion, he wisely acts upon the\r\nmaxim that discretion is the better part of valor. He was born in a\r\nsmall town on the Hudson River, in this State. Before the California\r\ngold excitement broke out he and his brother were in the hotel business.\r\nHe has always been dependent on his own exertions; he has fought his way\r\nto opulence, such as a prince might envy, by his own keen intelligence\r\nand undaunted enterprise. He began in humble circumstances. To-day he is\r\nworth twenty millions. He is a permanent resident in the metropolis, and\r\nis regarded as one of New York’s best and most influential citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _D. O. Mills_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe laid the foundation of his vast wealth in California. On the breaking\r\nout of the gold fever he and his brother left their native town for the\r\nfields of adventure, where men of shrewd foresight and determined\r\ncourage achieved a success stranger than the wonders of a Persian tale.\r\nThe brothers did not trust to luck. They chartered a sailing vessel,\r\nloaded it with commodities likely to be in demand among the miners, and\r\nthen sailed for the Golden Gate _via_ Cape Horn. After a narrow escape\r\nfrom shipwreck they arrived at San Francisco and at once opening a\r\nstore, they sold their merchandise to the eager miners at fabulous\r\nprices. D. O. Mills rapidly accumulated wealth, and when Wm. C. Ralston\r\norganized the Bank of California, he became its President. During the\r\ntime that Mr. Mills gave his attention to the Bank of California it was\r\nthe most successful institution of a similar character in this country,\r\nbut when he decided to remove to New York his connection with the great\r\nbank was severed. Disaster came under Ralston’s administration. Mr.\r\nMills had continued to be a stockholder, and when a financial hurricane\r\nstruck the bank, he was quick to go to the rescue. He contributed\r\nlargely to provide for the bank’s losses and to reorganize it with new\r\ncapital, which placed it again among the foremost financial institutions\r\nof the United States. The credit of this Herculean achievement was due\r\nmore to him perhaps than to any other man. His social position is\r\ndeservedly high. His son married the daughter of a member of the\r\nhistoric Livingston family, one of the oldest and most illustrious in\r\nthis country. His daughter married the successor to the editorial chair\r\nof Greeley, Whitelaw Reid, whose able management of the _Tribune_ has\r\nestablished a world-wide fame for that gentleman. These marriages of his\r\nchildren strengthened his already strong position socially, which he\r\nsoon won despite the fact that he was a newcomer. Mr. Mills is\r\ndistinguished for a princely liberality. He believes in distributing his\r\nproperty generously while living. He has built, therefore, one of the\r\nfinest residences in this city for his son; he bought for his daughter,\r\nMrs. Reid, at a cost of four hundred thousand dollars, the Villard\r\npalace on Madison Avenue. His other acts of generosity are numberless.\r\nHe himself lives in fine style. He paid the highest price ever paid per\r\nfoot for a residence in New York when he bought from D. P. Morgan, for\r\none hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, that gentleman’s\r\nresidence directly opposite St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue.\r\nThis mansion occupies two lots on a Columbia College leasehold. After\r\npurchasing it Mr. Mills gave a _carte blanche_ order to a noted\r\ndecorator of New York, and during a trip to California the work of\r\ndecoration was done. On his return he at once took possession of a\r\nmansion of which a Shah of Persia might be proud. He was delighted with\r\nall that had been wondrously wrought by the beautifying touch of\r\nsplendid art; with the richly carved wood work, the gorgeously\r\npicturesque ceilings, the inlaid walls and floors, and the _tout\r\nensemble_ of Oriental magnificence. His contentment was complete, but a\r\nsurprise awaited him. It was the decorator’s bill for four hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars. This, it is said, slightly disturbed his\r\nserenity. It caused him to look with a critic’s eye on the splendid\r\ndecorations which constituted a study in the fine arts at such high\r\nrates of tuition. As with the eagle eye of a connoisseur, he perceived\r\nthat the bill was altogether too high. He succeeded in getting, however,\r\nonly a slight reduction. Moral: Don’t give carte blanche orders to\r\ndecorators any more than you would hire a cab without first making a\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nMr. Mills came to New York to take up his residence some years ago, with\r\na fortune of many millions of dollars. He is particularly worthy of a\r\nplace in this book, as from the time of making his home here he has been\r\nprominently identified with Wall Street. Soon after taking up his\r\nresidence here he became acquainted with William H. Vanderbilt, at whose\r\nsuggestion he invested very heavily in Lake Shore. He made by this\r\noperation no less than $2,700,000. This large sum he devoted to the\r\nconstruction of a palatial building on Broad Street, which bears his\r\nname, and is probably the finest and most complete structure for office\r\npurposes in the world. It has a frontage of 175 feet on Broad street, 30\r\nfeet on Wall Street, and 150 feet on Exchange place, and is nine stories\r\nhigh. Thirteen buildings were torn down to secure its site. It was begun\r\nin May, 1880, and was practically finished in one year, the men working\r\nnight and day. It is built largely of Philadelphia brick, with\r\nBelleville brown stone trimmings. It is otherwise ornamented with terra\r\ncotta, and Corinthian and Renaissance capitols, and red Kentucky marble\r\npillars. On the first three floors the wainscoting is of Italian marble,\r\nand there is marble tiling throughout the building; the woodwork on the\r\nfirst two floors is mahogany, and on the upper floors it is reeded and\r\npanelled cherry. There are 400 offices, and the tenant population is\r\n1,200. For weeks at a time the total daily average number of persons\r\ncarried on six elevators has been no less than fifteen thousand. The\r\nworking force necessary to look after this magnificent structure numbers\r\n60 person. The net annual rental is about $200,000, the highest\r\nindividual rent paid being $20,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Mills’ exceptional skill as a financier has won him a high\r\nreputation in New York, and his counsel on vexed and abstruse questions\r\nhas often been quoted by powerful corporations. He is a director in\r\nseveral railroads, including the Erie, and it is understood is\r\ninterested in mining enterprises. In the battle of life he has achieved\r\nsignal success. His career is a fitting lesson to future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Chas Crocker_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHARLES CROCKER.\r\n\r\nCharles Crocker is now about 65 years of age, and lives in New York\r\ncity. He was born in Ohio in humble circumstances, and early in life\r\nfollowed for a time the occupation of blacksmith. He used to get up at\r\nfour o’clock in the morning and work hard all day. It was a hard life,\r\nand he engaged, after a time, in other occupations, gradually, in the\r\nmeantime, by thrift and industry, amassing a sufficient sum to enable\r\nhim to go to California, in the height of the mining fever, and\r\nestablish a general store in Sacramento. He met with considerable\r\nsuccess in trade, and when the project was formed to build the Central\r\nPacific Railroad, he lent his aid to the enterprise, and has ever since\r\nbeen identified with that corporation. He is now its Secretary and\r\nVice-President, and is also interested in associate roads.\r\n\r\n                             MARK HOPKINS.\r\n\r\nMark Hopkins died some years ago, worth fifteen million dollars. He was\r\nfrom Massachusetts, and went to California on the breaking out of the\r\nmining furore, and settled in Sacramento, where he soon engaged in the\r\nhardware business with C. P. Huntington, with whom he also embarked in\r\nthe ambitious enterprise of building the Central Pacific Railroad. He\r\nwon a large fortune in his railroad operations. His widow has a\r\nmagnificent estate at South Great Barrington, in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the famous mining princes of the Pacific Slope. The\r\ndiscovery of gold in California, and of the rich deposits of the\r\nprecious metal elsewhere on the Pacific Slope, led not merely to the\r\naccumulation of vast individual fortunes; it sent the currents of new\r\nlife humming through the veins, so to speak, of the entire country; it\r\nstimulated trade; it awakened new life; it gave a tremendous impulse to\r\na thousand industrial enterprises; it sent the Republic forth as a\r\nconquering hero of commerce, leveling all obstacles and laughing at\r\ndifficulties; tunneling mountains, building railroads whose very rails\r\nseem to catch a golden gleam from the rich traffic; spanning great\r\nrivers with majestic bridges, building ships and steamers; setting vast\r\nmanufactories to awake the solitude of primeval forests with the thunder\r\nof machinery, the ringing of hammers and the thousand voices of labor;\r\nbuilding villages, towns and cities with such marvelous rapidity as to\r\nsuggest the touch of the magical wand of genii. With the treasure taken\r\nfrom her bosom nature herself was subdued; an electric thrill stirred\r\nthe older centres of population as it led the new sections, and the\r\nRepublic has ever since, regardless of those periodical reactions known\r\nas panics, kept its onward march in fulfillment of that far-sighted\r\nprophecy that the star of empire takes its way to the West, and that on\r\nthe broad stage of the American Continent the Anglo-Saxon race will win\r\nfar greater triumphs than it has ever achieved in its amazing career\r\nsince it sprang from the barbarism of the Northern wilds of Europe to\r\ntake its proud station as the dominant family on this globe. The rich\r\ngold mines, and later the great silver mines, have given this country a\r\nfeverish dream of speculation, in which gigantic fortunes have been\r\namassed. The richest deposit of silver in Nevada, if not in the world,\r\nwas the Comstock lode on the east side of Mount Davidson, in Storey\r\ncounty, and partly under the towns of Virginia and Gold Hill. At one\r\ntime its ores contained one-third in value of gold and two-thirds of\r\nsilver. The lode has been traced on the surface some twenty-seven\r\nthousand feet, and has actually been explored about twenty thousand\r\nfeet, within which space most of the larger mines are located. The lode\r\nhas been opened to the depth of about twenty-two hundred feet. The\r\nvarious mines on this lode have given a total return, it is estimated,\r\nof some three hundred millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _J W. Mackay_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous of the bonanza magnates is John W. Mackay. His\r\nrise to financial power reads like a romance, and yet his astounding\r\nsuccess was by no means attained as by turning over a hand. He believed\r\nin the richness of the bonanza field; he and a number of associates\r\npurchased the controlling interest in the corporations which owned it.\r\nThen began the grand hunt for the ore body. Others had tried to find it,\r\nbut had given it up in despair. The idea that the property was worth\r\nworking was laughed to scorn. The men who believed in it persisted in\r\nspite of all discouragements, which were many; they spent about half a\r\nmillion in prospecting. They made in 1875, after long and trying\r\nefforts, the famous strike which astounded the business world, and\r\nstirred up a speculative fever which did not die out for years. This\r\nplain, quiet, unpretending financier was born in the humblest\r\ncircumstances in Dublin, Nov. 28, 1835, and is consequently in his 52nd\r\nyear. He came to this country very early in life, and as a boy worked\r\nfor Wm. H. Webb, the once famous shipbuilder of New York. In 1852 he\r\nwent with a party to California, sailing in one of the ships of his\r\nformer employer. It has been said that previous to this he kept a liquor\r\nsaloon in Louisville. Like so many others, however, he caught the gold\r\nfever, and on arriving in California he immediately engaged in placer\r\nmining in Sierra county of that State. He met with the usual\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, but at last a fair degree of success rewarded\r\nhis untiring efforts, and he thereupon went to Virginia City, Nevada,\r\nand started a tunnel in what was called the Union ground, north of the\r\nOphir mine. The speculation was disastrous. He lost all he possessed,\r\nbut he was not conquered. He secured work as a timber man in the Mexican\r\nmine, and he engaged also as a miner, swinging the pick and shovel, and\r\nlittle dreaming that this would be told as an interesting circumstance\r\nin a career which was to be successful beyond his wildest hopes. He\r\nlabored industriously; he saved his money, and he watched his\r\nopportunities, which very few people do. He got his first important\r\nstart in connection with the Kentuck mine in Gold Hill, but he had\r\nfrequent fluctuations of fortune until finally, in 1863, he formed a\r\nmining co-partnership with J. M. Walker, a brother of a former Governor\r\nof Virginia, and subsequently the firm was strengthened by the addition\r\nof Messrs. Flood, O’Brien, and Fair. The firm struck their first great\r\nsuccess in 1865-67 during their control of the Hale & Norcross mine.\r\nLater came the celebrated California and Consolidated Virginia mines,\r\nthe wonders of the mining world. He was married in 1867 to the daughter\r\nof Daniel Hungerford. Hungerford, by the way, was a Canadian, who came\r\nto New York many years ago and lived in West Broadway, where he followed\r\nthe occupation of a barber. When the Mexican war broke out he enlisted,\r\nand at the close of that war he returned to his family and his previous\r\noccupation. When the famous Colonel Walker raised a force in New York\r\nfor the invasion of Nicaragua, Hungerford, who seems to have been of an\r\nadventurous spirit, enlisted, and barely escaped the fate of Walker and\r\nthose of his force who were captured and shot by the Nicaragua\r\nauthorities. He escaped by fleet running, and again returned to his\r\nfamily and tonsorial profession, dying soon after his return. His\r\ndaughter married a physician, with whom she went to Nevada. He died and\r\nleft her in reduced circumstances. With the open-handed generosity\r\ncharacteristic of the financiers of the Pacific Slope, a number of\r\nwealthy gentlemen, learning of the circumstances, started a\r\nsubscription, to which Mr. Mackay made a large contribution. She called\r\nto thank him, and the acquaintance thus begun ripened into mutual\r\nattachment, whose happy consummation was their marriage a few years\r\nlater. Mrs. Mackay, during the last few years, has resided for the most\r\npart in Paris and London, where she has lived on a scale of magnificence\r\nwhich has dazzled and astounded foreigners. Mr. Mackay himself has\r\napparently little inclination for social triumphs; he is well liked\r\nwherever he is known for his quick, genial manners, but seems to avoid\r\npublicity. He alternates, for the most part, between New York and San\r\nFrancisco. In New York his office is at the Nevada Bank, in which he is\r\na large stockholder, owning, in fact, half of the stock. In recent years\r\nhe has become largely interested in a cable line to Europe, started in\r\nopposition to other well-known lines. His fortune is estimated at twenty\r\nmillions. Mr. Mackay’s step-daughter was married a few years ago to the\r\nPrince of Colonna, who belongs to one of the most ancient and wealthy\r\nfamilies of the nobility of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES C. FLOOD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nJames C. Flood was once a poor boy of New York city, now he is worth\r\nmore millions than can exactly be told. He went to San Francisco in\r\n1849, poor and friendless, and in company with the late W. S. O’Brien,\r\nopened a liquor saloon, where he sold whiskey at 12½ cents a glass. He\r\ndrew the liquor from casks piled one upon another. In those early days\r\nof the future queen of the Pacific Slope there were no gorgeous saloons\r\nwith tesselated marble floors, a dazzling stretch of costly mirrors, and\r\na gallery of rare pictures. Such resorts as Flood’s, in the slang of the\r\nday, were termed “gin mills,” and in the man who drew whiskey from the\r\ncasks rather than tendering a heavy cut glass decanter, it would have\r\nbeen difficult for the most fanciful to have recognized the future\r\nfamous man of millions. He made money and went into mining stocks. The\r\nfirst great mining speculation in which Flood, with his partner,\r\nO’Brien, embarked was in 1862, in Kentuck and the stocks of other mines\r\non the Comstock lode. Then they went heavily into Hale & Norcross, one\r\nof the old time favorites. They were generally successful in these\r\noperations, but a crowning and dazzling triumph awaited them. In\r\nFebruary of 1874 there were whispers that the Consolidated Virginia,\r\nwhich had caused a furore some ten years previous, but had fallen off\r\nmaterially, and the newer mine, the California, would soon develop rich\r\nbodies of ore. Flood and his partners, who owned these mines, became\r\ncertain of this prospective bonanza in the following winter, and early\r\nin 1875 came the announcement of the discovery of the fabulous ore\r\nbodies which made the name of the Comstock lode known round the world,\r\nand lifted the owners of the celebrated mines at once into wealth so\r\nenormous as to make the extravagances of the Arabian Nights seem tame.\r\nThe establishment of the Nevada Bank was the idea of Mr. Flood, who is\r\nsaid to possess a natural aptitude for finance. He became president of\r\nthe bank and a large stockholder in it. He is a man of compact robust\r\nbuild, five feet nine inches in height, with quiet, courteous manners,\r\nand of an energetic, self-reliant and industrious disposition. He has\r\nhad a remarkable rise, but has shown himself equal to the surprising\r\ngood fortune which has attended his strange career.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES G. FAIR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to recall the fact that the original Comstock\r\nsyndicate, most of whom derived such enormous wealth from the Comstock\r\nlode, was composed of Messrs. Mackay, Flood, O’Brien, Fair and Walker.\r\nSoon after these gentlemen became associated in their great enterprises,\r\nWalker sold out his share of one-fifth to Mackay, for a very small\r\nconsideration, and this consequently gave that gentleman an interest of\r\ntwo-fifths, against the one-fifth share held by each of the three others\r\nin the firm, a fact which accounts for Mackay’s greater wealth. Walker,\r\none of the original parties in interest, afterward not only lost in\r\nmining and other speculations the amount which Mackay had paid him for\r\nhis share, but all his other means, and was, in fact, completely\r\nbeggared, and died in an asylum for paupers. He had experienced dramatic\r\nvicissitudes of fortune. He ought to have been worth fully twenty\r\nmillions of dollars. He died without a penny.\r\n\r\n                             W. S. O’BRIEN.\r\n\r\nW. S. O’Brien was associated with Mackay, Flood and Fair in developing\r\nmines on the Comstock, and died in 1878, enormously wealthy. He was born\r\nin New York, went to San Francisco in the early days of the gold\r\nexcitement, and at first kept a liquor saloon with Flood. He gradually\r\nengaged in mining speculations, and ultimately met with such success\r\nthat he died famous as one of the bonanza kings. It is an interesting\r\ncircumstance that four Irishmen secured the lion’s share of the bonanza\r\nmillions, and they were all born poor. The harp of Tara’s halls never\r\nwas struck to so strange a roundelay as this.\r\n\r\n                             JAMES G. FAIR.\r\n\r\nJames G. Fair is another of the bonanza kings who has had an interesting\r\ncareer. He was born Dec. 3d, 1831, near Belfast, Ireland. He came to\r\nthis country with his parents in 1843 and settled in Illinois. He\r\nreceived a thorough business education in Chicago, and at the same time\r\ndevoted considerable attention to scientific studies. On the breaking\r\nout of the gold fever in 1849 he removed to California, settling at\r\nLong’s Bar, Feather River, in that State. He mined on the Bar for some\r\ntime without much success, and then turned his attention to quartz\r\nmining. Placer mining in those days was conducted in too primitive a\r\nfashion to suit a man of his mechanical ingenuity. Placer, by the way,\r\nis a term of Spanish origin, signifying a gravelly place where gold is\r\nfound, especially by the side of a river or in the bed of a mountain\r\ntorrent. In quartz mining, on the other hand, the metal is obtained by\r\nsmelting after crushing the rock of which it forms a part. Mr. Fair\r\nengaged in quartz mining in Calaveras county, California, and later\r\nbecame superintendent of various quartz mines in other parts of the\r\nState. In 1855 he became superintendent of the Ophir, and four years\r\nlater of the Hale & Norcross. In 1860 he removed to Nevada and became\r\nactively engaged in developing mines. In 1867 he formed a partnership\r\nwith John W. Mackay, James C. Flood and Wm. S. O’Brien. The firm, at Mr.\r\nFair’s suggestion, obtained control of the California and Sides mine,\r\nthe White & Murphy, the Central Nos. 1 and 2, and the tract known as the\r\nKinney ground, and it was in this rich field that the famous California\r\nand Consolidated Virginia mines were developed, the yield of which,\r\nunder Mr. Fair’s superintendence, is estimated at about two hundred\r\nmillion dollars. He began speculative buying of real estate in San\r\nFrancisco in 1858, and is now said to own seventy acres of land in\r\ndifferent parts of that city, constituting in itself an enormous\r\nfortune. He was elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat to\r\nsucceed the Hon. William Sharon, and took his seat in 1881, his term\r\nexpiring March 3d, 1887. In person Mr. Fair is of about the medium\r\nheight, of compact, solid build, has handsome features, and is a man who\r\nwould be likely to attract attention anywhere. His fortune is estimated\r\nat from ten to twenty millions.\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM SHARON.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sharon was one of the remarkable men developed by the mining\r\nexcitement in this country, one of the sagacious, self-reliant men who\r\ninevitably come to the front wherever they are found. He showed his\r\nmettle when the Bank of California was forced to suspend, and when a\r\ncommercial pall hung over San Francisco. In the midst of the frenzied\r\nexcitement he was one of the few who kept cool and never lost their\r\ncourage. The wild excitement on the Stock Exchange of San Francisco was\r\nstopped at his suggestion that the sessions be indefinitely postponed.\r\nThen he called a meeting of the Bank of California directors and made a\r\nstirring appeal to them to stand by the bank in the hour of its\r\nmisfortune, and rescue the business interests of the coast from the\r\nparalysis by which they were likely to be seized if they did not take a\r\nresolute stand, put their shoulders to the wheel and acquit themselves\r\nlike men. He proposed that each subscribe liberally to put the bank\r\nagain in operation, and set the example by a very large\r\nsubscription—said to have been five million dollars. Others also\r\nsubscribed liberally, and to the astonishment and joy of the city the\r\nbank again threw open its doors for business. He had some years prior to\r\nthis become connected in business with the lamented Ralston.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sharon was born in Ohio, and early in life began the practice of\r\nlaw in Illinois. He went to San Francisco, and immediately engaged in\r\nthe real estate business, and ultimately became a very large operator in\r\nlands, but failed, and in 1863 went to Nevada to take the agency of the\r\nBank of California in Gold Hill and Virginia City. The bank had large\r\nloans out on mining property, and as the production of many of the mines\r\nhad seriously declined, Ralston grew uneasy, and was greatly relieved\r\nwhen Sharon offered to become personally responsible for these loans on\r\ncondition that the bank advance him a considerable sum to be used in\r\ncontemplated mining developments, and allow him two years in which to\r\nmeet the loans. The terms were accepted. Sharon ran new drifts here and\r\nthere, and in four months, to Ralston’s amazement, paid all the loans,\r\nand placed on deposit three-quarters of a million to his own account.\r\nThis feat drew general attention to him; he was consulted in large\r\noperations; he became a director in the great bank. He never forgot\r\nRalston’s kindness to him. He assumed entire charge of the personal\r\naffairs of Ralston after his death, and settled on Mrs. Ralston nearly\r\nhalf a million of dollars. He finally entered politics, and represented\r\nCalifornia in the United States Senate. He was a conspicuous example of\r\nbusiness acumen and surprising energy, as well as of becoming gratitude\r\nto the knightly Ralston, of whom he always said: “He was my benefactor.”\r\n\r\n                            WM. C. RALSTON.\r\n\r\nWm. C. Ralston was one of the most notable, as he was one of the most\r\nremarkable, of all the financial giants of the Pacific Slope. He\r\nascended the gilded summits of financial renown, and he fell into a\r\nshadowy valley of stern retribution and utter ruin. No man could be more\r\npopular, none could exhibit greater daring in his business enterprises.\r\nHe was a New York boy, but drifted to the West, and became a clerk on a\r\nMississippi steamboat, finally became Captain, and having amassed some\r\nmoney, he leaped into speculative waters, like another Leander, to swim\r\nthe Hellespont of California finance. He became associated with\r\nCommodore Garrison and two others in the banking business in San\r\nFrancisco about 1853. Finally he organized the Bank of California, and\r\nbecame first its Cashier and then its President. His rise was\r\nmarvellous. At one time he was supposed to be worth $20,000,000 or more.\r\nHe had a country seat at Belmont, in San Mateo county, that a king might\r\nhave been proud to own, and here he entertained in royal fashion. Every\r\ncelebrity that visited California was received with regal hospitality by\r\nthis monetary prince of the golden State. But as the allied armies\r\narrayed against Napoleon were often put to rout from being too much\r\nspread out, so this financial Titan, combining the genius and courage of\r\nmany in one, was finally overthrown by adverse fortune, because his\r\nenterprises were too much spread out. He had too many projects on hand\r\nat one time. He lost heavily in mining and real estate speculations; he\r\nlost in manufacturing enterprises. Fate struck him suddenly as with the\r\nhammer of Thor. In one fearful storm of trouble all his misfortune\r\ndescended upon him at once. All the waves and billows of adversity broke\r\nover him. He had no chance to recover himself. Birnam seemed all at once\r\nto come to his financial Dunsinane. An investigation of the affairs of\r\nthe Bank of California was made by the directors of that institution.\r\nTheir suspicions had been aroused that Ralston’s administration of its\r\naffairs was open to grave criticism. He attended the meeting of the\r\ndirectors, and was coldly requested to withdraw during the discussion.\r\nHe who had been absolute in the great bank saw that his power was gone;\r\nhe stood on the brink of a moral Niagara. He left the Directors to make\r\nthe inevitable discovery that he had over-issued the stock of the bank\r\nsome $6,000,000, and crazed with grief and despair, found a suicide’s\r\ndeath in the waters of the bay. He had over-issued the stock hoping and\r\nbelieving that success in some one of his numerous and gigantic\r\nenterprises would enable him to provide for it, but disaster stealing on\r\nhim suddenly, like a thief in the night, frustrated any plan of\r\nrestitution, and he paid for his fault with his life. He was a man about\r\nfive feet seven inches in height, with a rather florid complexion, a\r\nfull light brown beard and kindly brown eyes. He was once the idol of\r\nCalifornia, and his one great fault is almost swallowed up in the memory\r\nof his princely generosity, his hearty geniality, and his many other\r\nengaging traits.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN P. JONES.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Jones has had an eventful career. He has made and lost millions.\r\nHe was worth at one time five or six millions. He lost very heavily in\r\nrailroad enterprises in Southern California. He had been engaged in\r\nmining and had won a big heap of treasure, probably as much wealth as\r\nany one needs, or more, but with the restless ambition of one who would\r\ntravel still higher up the glittering heights of financial fame he\r\nsought to emulate Huntington, Stanford and others and become a railroad\r\nmagnate. It was a case of vaulting ambition o’erleaping itself and\r\nfalling on the other side. He lost almost his entire fortune, but he has\r\nnow regained his feet again and is once more wealthy. He profited by the\r\nrevival of interest in mines and mining stocks in 1886, and secured,\r\nmoreover, a considerable interest in the Alaska mine, in which D. O.\r\nMills was interested. He bought stocks of once famous mines at low\r\nprices, and when the advance on the revival of public interest in mining\r\nshares took place he was a large gainer. John W. Mackay has within the\r\nlast few years shown a disposition to lend him assistance in his\r\nendeavors to recover his former footing. John P. Jones is one of a\r\nnumber of Englishmen who have won financial celebrity in this country.\r\nHe was born in Herefordshire, England, in 1830, and came to this country\r\nwith his parents when only a year old, settling in Ohio. For a few years\r\nhe attended school in Cleveland. In the early days of the gold\r\nexcitement in California he emigrated to that State and engaged in\r\nfarming and mining. He acquired a taste for politics. He represented his\r\ncounty in both houses of the State Assembly. In 1867 he went to Gold\r\nHill, Nevada, and has ever since been engaged to a greater or less\r\nextent in developing the mineral resources of that State. In his earlier\r\ndays he worked hard as a miner in one of the counties of California. He\r\nworked in placers and tunnels; he had many ups and down. He was daring\r\nand ambitious, and sometimes seemingly reckless. He spent a million\r\ndollars trying to develop some mines in Mono, California, and then gave\r\nup the attempt. At one time he controlled the Ophir, Savage and Crown\r\nPoint mines on the Comstock lode; he owned large establishments for the\r\nmanufacture of ice in Georgia, Louisiana and Texas and elsewhere; he\r\nmade large purchases of land in California; he engaged in a multitude of\r\nambitious enterprises. He had too many irons in the fire. Misfortune did\r\nnot daunt him. Like the old hunter of tradition, his motto was, “Pick\r\nthe flint and try it again.” He may yet become a financial power again.\r\nHe has a certain readiness as a speaker; he is of large frame and not\r\nunpleasing aspect, and his taste for public debate and the excitements\r\nof the political arena have led him into contests for public honors\r\nwhich have been successful. He was elected as a Republican to the United\r\nStates Senate in 1872, and has twice been elected, so that his term will\r\nnot expire until 1891.\r\n\r\nR. J. Baldwin has become widely known by the sobriquet of “lucky.” He is\r\n59 years old and was born in Ohio. His father moved to Indiana and had a\r\nfarm adjoining that of Schuyler Colfax. There he worked till he reached\r\nhis twentieth year. He married in the following year and went to a small\r\nplace in Indiana and kept a country store; he soon built canal boats to\r\nply between Chicago and St. Louis. He went to Racine, Wisconsin, in\r\n1850, and engaged in the grocery business with considerable success. He\r\nwas keen at a bargain and always had an eye out for the main chance. His\r\nso-called “luck” was in reality business skill. He went to California in\r\n1853, after purchasing a number of horses and wagons and an ample supply\r\nof merchandise. He found a good market for his goods in Salt Lake,\r\nmaking nearly four thousand dollars on the venture, and further on he\r\nsold his wagons and harness and made up a pack train over the mountains,\r\nand, arriving in San Francisco, sold his teams at good prices. His trip\r\nhad been a complete success. He now went into the hotel business, and,\r\nafter selling out twice to good advantage, he formed a partnership to\r\nengage in the brick trade, which, proving very successful mainly through\r\nhis skill in drumming up business, he decided to go into it alone. He\r\nhimself knew nothing about brick making, but he studied up the subject\r\nand eventually became an expert. He obtained remunerative contracts with\r\nthe Government; he boarded his men and made for a time about fifteen\r\nhundred dollars a month. He finally sold out and went into the livery\r\nbusiness. He made money and invested considerable in real estate. He\r\nsold out and went to Virginia City, Nevada, at the breaking out of the\r\nmining excitement there. At that point he started a lumber yard. He\r\nspeculated in mines and met at times with great success, but once he was\r\nso badly worsted in this great game that he was compelled to mortgage\r\nall of his property; but the tide turned soon and became a flood of\r\ngold. He speculated in such mines as the Crown Point, Belcher,\r\nConsolidated Virginia, California and Ophir. He acquired at one time the\r\ncontrolling interest in the Ophir. He has speculated heavily in San\r\nFrancisco real estate, and with marked success. He erected a building\r\nthere that cost, with all its appurtenances, over three million dollars.\r\nPart of it is used as a theatre. He bought sixty thousand acres of land\r\nin Los Angeles county, and had practically a town of his own. He spent\r\nabout half a million dollars improving this tract, more particularly his\r\nSanta Anita ranch of over fifteen thousand acres. His sagacity and\r\nindustry, rather than mere “luck,” have won him his fortune of ten or\r\nfifteen million dollars.\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM H. STEWART.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Stewart, another successful man of the Far West, who has\r\ntwice represented Nevada in the United States Senate, was a New York\r\nboy, born in Wayne county in 1827. A good many New York boys have\r\nsucceeded in the West. He went to California early in 1850. In the fall\r\nof that year, while prospecting, he discovered the Eureka placer\r\ndiggings; he built saw mills, worked claims because disgusted with\r\nmining, went to Nevada City in the spring of 1852, and in December of\r\nthat year was appointed District Attorney, was elected to that office in\r\nthe following year, and in 1854 was appointed Attorney General,\r\nthereupon taking up his residence in San Francisco, where, by the way,\r\nhe married a daughter of ex-Governor Foote, of Mississippi. Later he\r\nreturned to Nevada City and established a very lucrative law practice,\r\nand remained in that county till the spring of 1860, when the furore\r\nover the Comstock mines induced him to go to Virginia City, Nevada. He\r\nthoroughly understood mining law, and soon had a large practice. The\r\nlarge sums which his legal talents brought him were invested in mines,\r\nand he became one of the leading operators on the Comstock lode. He\r\ninvested half a million dollars in San Francisco real estate. He\r\nrendered important services to mining interests while in the United\r\nStates Senate, in preventing the passage of a bill providing for the\r\nsale of all the mineral lands of the country at public auction, a\r\nmeasure which it was supposed would concentrate much of the mining\r\nproperty of the United States into the hands of the wealthy.\r\n\r\n                              JAMES LICK.\r\n\r\nJames Lick, born in Pennsylvania in 1796, was one of the strange\r\ncharacters of California. He went there in 1847, after having been a\r\nmanufacturer of pianos in this country and different parts of South\r\nAmerica. He took $30,000 to San Francisco, which he invested in real\r\nestate, foreseeing that it was to become the great city of the Pacific\r\nSlope. He bought lots by the mile. His profits were enormous. He became\r\none of the great millionaires of California. He set aside $2,000,000 in\r\n1874, to be held by seven trustees, and to be devoted to certain public\r\nand charitable purposes. In 1875 he desired to make some changes in his\r\nschedule of gifts, and when the trustees expressed some doubts as to\r\ntheir legal right to give assent, at his request they resigned. The next\r\nyear he died, and then followed a litigation by his son and other heirs,\r\nwhich was finally so adjusted as to leave a large sum to be devoted to\r\nvarious public and charitable projects. He left $60,000 to be devoted to\r\na statue of Francis Scott Key, the author of the “Star Spangled Banner.”\r\nHe was very eccentric, due, it is said, to an early disappointment in\r\nlove. He sought the hand of a miller’s daughter, but was dismissed by\r\nthe father, because young Lick did not own a mill. When he became\r\nenormously wealthy, James Lick built a large mill, and adorned it with\r\nmahogany and costly woods as a memorial of his youthful attachment. He\r\nseemed to derive almost childish pleasure in contemplating this splendid\r\nbuilding, which would have so far outshone any that could ever have been\r\nowned by the man who had once spurned him for his poverty. The poor\r\nyoung men of one generation are often the millionaires of the next. One\r\nof the great monuments to his memory is the great Lick Observatory.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN W. SHAW.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Shaw, who made considerable money in mines and mining stocks, is\r\none of the Western millionaires who reside in New York. He was a\r\nsuperintendent of mines, and speculated on his information. He was at\r\none time prominently identified with the Eureka Consolidated mine. He is\r\nsupposed to be worth $4,000,000 to $5,000,000, and is now President of\r\nthe Hocking Valley Road. Messrs. Keene, Lent, Dewey, Harpending,\r\nVerdenal and other more or less successful men well known in California,\r\nlive here. One of the distinguished lawyers of the West who have come\r\nhere to establish a practice is ex-Governor Hoadly, of Ohio. Austin\r\nCorbin, though at one time a lawyer in Iowa, found his true field in New\r\nYork, and Alfred Sully, after amassing some means in the same State,\r\nlikewise found himself drawn to New York, and won unexpected success in\r\nfinance here.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n             RAILROAD INVESTMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASTNESS OF OUR RAILROAD SYSTEM.—ITS COST.—FALL IN THE RATE OF\r\n    INTEREST.—TENDENCY TO A FOUR PER CENT. RATE ON RAILROAD\r\n    BONDS.—EFFECT OF THE CHANGE ON STOCKS.—PROSPECTIVE SPECULATION.—SOME\r\n    SOCIAL INEQUITIES TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH CHEAPER TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, few who distinctly realize the magnitude of the\r\namount of capital invested in the railroads of the United States. The\r\nimmense area over which our population is distributed necessitates a\r\nmuch greater length of railroad, as compared with inhabitants, than\r\nexists in any other nation. In 1884 we had, according to “Poor’s Manual\r\nof Railroads,” no less than 125,380 miles of road within the United\r\nStates, which exceeds the entire mileage of Europe. This was required to\r\nprovide for the travel and transportation of about 54,000,000 of\r\npopulation, while Great Britain, France, and Germany, with their\r\ncombined population of 120,000,000, had in the same year about 60,000\r\nmiles, and Russia, with some 85,000,000 of people, had only about 19,000\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be a matter for boasting that we have found it necessary\r\nto provide such a disproportionate length of road to accommodate the\r\nwants of trade and travel; for the more capital we have to invest in the\r\nfacilities for carriage the less we have for investment in the means for\r\nproduction, and the more we have to pay for transportation service the\r\nworse is our position for competing with other nations. This,\r\nundoubtedly, is a much more important factor than is generally allowed\r\nin the question of our ability to command a share in the world’s\r\ninternational commerce proportioned to the extent of our population.\r\n\r\nThe cost of our railroads, as indicated by the capitalization statements\r\nof the Companies in 1884, is represented by $3,669,116,000 in bonds and\r\n$3,762,016,000 of stock. As shown in another chapter on “Railroad\r\nMethods,” the actual cash outlay in construction and equipments is very\r\nmuch less than these figures; but the roads aim to earn an investment\r\nreturn on these enormously inflated amounts, and do so as far as they\r\nmay be able.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this volume I have shown how the effort to earn dividends\r\nupon hundreds of millions of fictitious railroad capital is imposing an\r\nunjust tax on the people, retarding the growth of national commerce and\r\ncreating a distinct millionaire class not without danger to our\r\npolitical future; and I wish here to refer to one fact from which we may\r\nhope for some mitigation of this pernicious tendency.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years it has become very clear that a large permanent\r\nreduction has been effected in the rate of interest on fixed capital.\r\nPerhaps, the principal causes of this change has been (1) the high\r\ncredit of the Government, represented by a 3 per cent. rate of interest\r\non its loans; (2) diminution of the element of risk in our corporate\r\nenterprises; (3) the more developed and consolidated condition of our\r\nindustry; and (4) the growth of the national earnings in a ratio\r\ndisproportionate to the new undertakings inviting capital. To such an\r\nextent has the loanable resources of the country increased that, whereas\r\nten to fifteen years ago we found it necessary to borrow in other\r\ncountries a large portion of the money needed to build our railroads, we\r\nare now almost entirely independent of European lenders, and are\r\nbeginning to invest in the construction of roads in Canada and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThus comes about the fact that, while the bulk of the new outstanding\r\nrailroad bonds bear interest at 6 to 7 per cent., with exceptions at 5\r\nand 8 per cent., there is no difficulty in now negotiating the mortgages\r\nof sound railroads at 4 per cent., and that may be safely regarded as\r\nthe future rate for all meritorious loans. It is not difficult to see to\r\nwhat course of things this fact points. If new roads can be built on a 4\r\nper cent. ratio of interest charges, then the new constructions on that\r\nbasis and the gradual replacing of maturing loans at the same rate will\r\nvery quickly establish a competition between roads thus situated and the\r\nlarge mass of companies burdened with the old high rate of interest that\r\nwill bear very seriously on the latter. To a company with, say,\r\n$40,000,000 of bonded debt, it is a matter of a difference of $800,000\r\nper year in fixed charges whether it pays 6 per cent. interest or 4 per\r\ncent. This difference will be so vital in cases of competition between\r\nhigh rate roads and low-rate ones, that it will leave no choice, with a\r\nvery important proportion of our railroads, between facing financial\r\nembarrassment and taking immediate steps for readjusting their debts to\r\nthe new and lower rate of interest. As an important proportion of the\r\noriginal bonds issued 25 to 30 years ago at 6, 7, and 8 per cent. rate\r\nby the older roads are now beginning to mature very rapidly, a large\r\nextent of high-rate debt will from this time forward be transmuted into\r\n4 per cent. bonds, which will add force to the tendency here indicated.\r\n\r\nSome important results must follow from this new drift in railroad\r\ninvestments. One of the effects would naturally be a diminution of the\r\ncurrent high rate of premium on the old bonds, which has become, so\r\nadjusted as to yield, in most cases, a return of 4 to 4½ per cent. on\r\nthe market value. Holders of this class of bonds will perceive that the\r\ncompanies cannot long sustain the burden of their present high rate of\r\nfixed charges, and will soon come to discount in advance the inevitable\r\n“scaling” of their bonds. When the railroads begin to feel the effects\r\nof competition with the low-rate companies, they will not be slow to\r\nadjust their finances to the new situation; neither will they be nice\r\nabout their methods of effecting such adjustments; and the rights of\r\ncreditors will be ruthlessly dealt with under the compulsion of\r\nforeclosure; and when this compulsory stage is reached, it will not be\r\nvery long before a large proportion of the high-rate bonds is transmuted\r\ninto long 4 per cent. obligations.\r\n\r\nThis very important transition, upon a such large mass of investments,\r\nis to be anticipated as one of the most conspicuous financial events of\r\nthe comparatively near future. One of its first effects may be expected\r\nto appear in a certain tone of depression among investors, who will feel\r\nthemselves impoverished through the fall in the market value of their\r\nbonds, and by the impending reduction of one-third in their income from\r\nthis class of securities. The bondholders—and, indeed, investors\r\ngenerally—will be likely to reason that the reduction in the fixed\r\ncharges of the roads will leave so much more available for the\r\nstockholders; and there would be this extent of warrant for such a\r\nconclusion, that, as the stock of a company usually about equals the\r\namount of its bonds issues, any reduction in the rate of interest on the\r\nlatter would be just so much per cent. saved towards the dividend on\r\nshare capital. Under such circumstances, there would naturally be a\r\nmarked increase in the demand for railroad stocks, and a large advance\r\nin their market value would in all probability result. To those who\r\ncontemplate investing in railroad shares, this is a consideration which,\r\nit appears to me, should claim their consideration.\r\n\r\nIt would seem probable that, in the process of conversion here\r\nforeshadowed, there are the elements of an era of unusual speculative\r\nactivity at a period not very remote. That speculative movement may be\r\nexpected to consummate and finally adjust the change. Naturally, such an\r\nexcitement would tend to produce a great inflation in the price of\r\nstocks (as distinguished from bonds); the final stroke of adjustment,\r\nhowever, would come ultimately through the construction of new competing\r\nroads, which would take out of the net earnings of the roads as much as\r\nhad been saved by the reduction of interest on their debts, thus leaving\r\nthe dividend resources where they stood before the change. The final\r\nissue of this transition, therefore, would be to give the public at\r\nlarge about the entire benefit of what the railroads saved by the\r\namelioration of their debt charges.\r\n\r\nThe tendency I have here aimed to foreshadow is one that must largely\r\ntend to the public advantage. In other words, the railroads, having\r\nreduced by 30 to 40 per cent. their interest charges, will be in a\r\nposition to perform their services for correspondingly lower charges.\r\nThis will be an invaluable advantage to all our industries, and\r\nespecially to such as have to deal with bulky products, a considerable\r\nportion of the costs of which consists of charges for transportation,\r\nand the working class, who constitute the bulk of our consumers, will be\r\nespecially benefited.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter I have shown how the overcapitalization of our\r\nrailroads has caused a false and unjust distribution of wealth, and\r\nburdened our industries with transportation charges which are a serious\r\nobstacle to our national progress. The tendency above delineated shows\r\nhow seriously the natural laws governing the distribution of wealth\r\nprovide an ultimate remedy for such violations of these laws. The\r\nrailroad capitalists who have made their millions by providing railroads\r\nat such an inflated cost are now faced with the certain prospect of a\r\nloss of one-third of their income from their investments; and that\r\ndeduction will have to be distributed among the community at large in\r\nthe form of cheaper carriage.\r\n\r\nThis is but a repetition of what we find so many times in the history of\r\nnations, that when any important class exacts, by some artificial\r\nprocess, a vast amount of wealth that does not naturally and justly\r\nbelong to it, it ultimately finds the earning capacity of its\r\naccumulations declining. This is one among the many reasons why a low\r\nrate of interest is apt to prevail in countries where privileged or\r\naristocratic classes have absorbed an undue proportion of the national\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n             THE SILVER QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.—DANGERS OF NEGLECTING IT.—ATTEMPTS AT\r\n    EVASION.—HOW IT MUST BE FINALLY MET.—SILVER PAPER CURRENCY SCHEMES,\r\n    AND THEIR FUTILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all current public questions, I know of none that so vitally affects\r\nthe future of our financial interests as this one—what shall be the\r\nstatus of silver among the world’s currencies? At the present time,\r\nabout one-half of the world’s metallic money consists of silver, and the\r\nother half of gold. It is clear that silver cannot maintain its\r\nnecessary function as money unless it is invested with stability of\r\nexchangeable value. Such stability it cannot possess without the\r\nintervention of a conventional arrangement which, with all the force of\r\na uniform law, makes a given weight of silver virtually exchangeable for\r\na given weight of gold. This principle once established, and silver\r\nbullion being made convertible into silver coin at the mints of the\r\nchief nations on demand, it follows that the bullion value of silver\r\nmust constantly conform closely to its value as coin, and the stability\r\nof the value of silver coin would thus be insured.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty has been that, owing to petty jealousies and prejudices,\r\nGovernments have hesitated to act with the unanimity that is necessary\r\nto an efficient conventional arrangement. Each one has preferred that\r\nothers should take the responsibility of free coinage; and the result\r\nhas been that unrestricted coinage has been adopted only by those\r\nnations which happened to be most imperatively committed to the\r\nnecessity of protecting their silver circulation. Those nations were\r\ncomprised in the international combination known as “The Latin Union.”\r\nThat Union was found competent to take care of all the new supplies of\r\nsilver, so long as the principle of free coinage was maintained and the\r\nvalue of the metal was kept uniform under its operation. In an evil\r\nhour, however, certain German theorists persuaded Chancellor Bismarck to\r\ncommit Germany to the demonetization of silver. The large supply of the\r\nmetal thereby suddenly thrown into the mints of the Union nations\r\nalarmed that combination, first, into a limitation of their coinage of\r\nsilver, and, finally, into a suspension of it. The coinage demand for\r\nsilver being thus cut off, the price of silver bullion was cut loose\r\nfrom the relative legal valuation between silver coin and gold, and was\r\nleft to drift with the variations in the commercial demand, and to\r\ndecline in consequence of an excess of supply over demand. This is a\r\nbrief explanation of the causes of the present depreciation in the value\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\nI know of no way of repairing the value of that metal other than by\r\nestablishing an international union, similar in its objects and\r\nconditions to the now virtually defunct Latin Union, but embracing a\r\nwider range of Governments than that combination did; the co-operation\r\nof the United States, England and Germany being especially important.\r\nHere I may perhaps be permitted to republish a series of questions\r\npropounded by the New York _Daily Commercial Bulletin_, in October last,\r\nwith my answers appended, as briefly expressing the conclusions I have\r\nbeen led to form on this question:\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nI. Would the stock of gold in the world afford a basis broad enough to\r\nmeet the banking and commercial operations of Europe and the United\r\nStates, without the co-ordinate use of a properly regulated silver legal\r\ntender?\r\n\r\nII. Would you favor an International Coinage Union, embracing the United\r\nStates and the leading European Governments, based upon a uniform\r\nvaluation of silver as compared with gold, and binding each member to\r\ncoin on demand all silver presented at its mints and to make such coin a\r\nlegal tender?\r\n\r\nIII. Supposing the ratio of valuation adopted by such a Union to be the\r\npresent most general one of 15½ to 1, do you see any reason why the\r\nobligation of all nations in the Union to convert silver bullion into\r\nlegal tender coin at that rate should fail to restore silver to its\r\nformer value of about 60 pence per ounce?\r\n\r\nIV. Would the suspension of the coinage of the Silver Dollar be\r\njudicious, or necessary, or effectual, as a means of inducing European\r\nGovernments to join in an International Coinage compact?\r\n\r\nV. Are there any important reasons connected with the finances of the\r\nUnited States Government, with our currency system, or with the\r\nprospective trade of this country, why the coinage of the Standard\r\nDollar should be suspended?\r\n\r\nIV. Do you favor the immediate suspension of coinage of the Silver\r\nDollar?\r\n\r\n                                REPLIES.\r\n\r\n1. Possibly the existing stocks of gold in Europe and America might be\r\nsufficient to serve the purposes of banking reserves and for\r\ntransmission in the international exchanges; but it is impracticable to\r\nuse such a valuable metal to the extent required for the purposes of\r\nactive circulation, and this creates a necessity for a silver legal\r\ntender coin for the retail transactions of business. For this reason I\r\nregard the use of silver, co-ordinately with gold, as an indispensable\r\nelement in the world’s currency.\r\n\r\n2. I regard an international union as absolutely necessary for\r\nmaintaining the joint use of gold and silver, if the relative value\r\nbetween those metals is to be steadily maintained. If a uniform value of\r\nsilver were adopted by members of such a union, and if the mint of each\r\nnation were bound to coin all silver brought to it, and the coins were\r\nmade a legal tender, it appears to me that this would establish a\r\nuniform value for silver bullion the world over, on a parity with the\r\nlegal valuation of silver coin; and this conventional value of bullion\r\nwould be preserved as long as the union should be continued. Even the\r\nlimited international arrangement known as the Latin Union sufficed to\r\nkeep silver at about 60 pence per ounce, until its members, taking\r\nfright by the demonetization of silver by Germany, stopped the coinage\r\nof silver; when, the conventional support being withdrawn and the\r\ncoinage demand suspended, bullion fell to its value as a mere commodity.\r\nThis shows how effective the union principle is, and what becomes of\r\nsilver without it.\r\n\r\n3. If an international union were to fix the value of the two metals at\r\n15½ weights of silver to 1 of gold, the rate now general in Europe, and\r\nthe members of the union were compelled to coin it on demand at that\r\nrate, then the free convertibility of bullion into coin would\r\nnecessarily make the coin and the bullion of equal value, except the\r\nslight difference that might arise from coinage charges; which is\r\ntantamount to making silver worth about 60 pence an ounce, or its former\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n4. In view of the differences of opinion in Europe on the standard\r\nquestion and the strong prejudices in England in favor of the gold\r\nstandard, it appears to me more than doubtful whether any step will be\r\ntaken on this subject until those countries are made to carry the\r\nburthen of the large surplus of silver that we are now coining. But with\r\n25 to 30 millions of bullion of our silver going thither every year, the\r\neffect would be so serious upon Asiatic trade and upon the immense\r\nsilver circulation of the Latin nations, that it seems certain they\r\nwould soon become willing to assume their share in restoring silver. At\r\nany rate, it is a proper and necessary compulsion for us to apply.\r\n\r\n5. The Government is very closely threatened with a suspension of gold\r\npayments, if the coinage is continued. We have already seen a point at\r\nwhich the Treasury had to negotiate with the banks for six millions of\r\ngold to avert that catastrophe; and it is only a thin margin of a very\r\nfew millions that separates us from such a condition all the time. Of\r\ncourse, if the Government suspended coin payments, gold would be apt to\r\ngo to an indefinite premium; with the consequence of a rush of\r\ngreenbacks into the Treasury for redemption and a depreciation of such\r\npaper as is redeemable in silver to the purchasing power of that coin.\r\nIn my view, these dangers are much nearer than is generally supposed;\r\nand it is a most unjustifiable policy that needlessly perpetuates this\r\nstate of things.\r\n\r\n6. For the reasons assigned in my other answers to your inquiries, I\r\nregard the suspension of the coinage of the the silver dollars as to the\r\nlast degree imperative. And the suspension should be both total and\r\nunconditional. Either a partial or a temporary suspension would fail\r\nequally to avert the home dangers with which we are threatened, and to\r\nbring about that European action which is indispensable to a sound and\r\npermanent settlement of the question.\r\n\r\nSo long as there was no efficient conventional arrangement for\r\nmaintaining the value of silver, no nation can safely continue its\r\ncoinage, because, in so doing, it was increasing its stock of currency,\r\nthe future value of which could not be depended upon, and which might\r\neasily become a source of embarrassment and injustice between citizen\r\nand citizen, between debtor and creditor. In our country, however, such\r\nwas the political influence of the silver-producing States that they\r\neasily induced Congress to order the coinage of not less than\r\n$24,000,000 per annum of standard silver dollars. The effect of this has\r\nbeen, undoubtedly, to somewhat check the decline in silver bullion; but\r\nat the expense of the artificial addition already of $230,000,000 of\r\nbadly depreciated legal tender to our circulating medium. Our whole\r\ncurrency system has thus been vitiated; for our $680,000,000 of paper\r\nmoney may be redeemed in silver; and we are thus exposed to the very\r\ngravest dangers, in the event of anything causing an important drain of\r\ngold to Europe. That the coin thus issued was not really needed for the\r\npurposes of circulation is demonstrated by the fact that it has been\r\nfound impossible to get more than one-third of it into circulation. In\r\norder to obviate this difficulty, various devices have been introduced\r\nfor keeping the coin in the Treasury and issuing against it paper\r\ncertificates of small denominations. The most ingenious of these\r\ncontrivances was the one proposed by Hon. A. J. Warner, of Ohio, and\r\npressed on the Government for its endorsement. In September last I took\r\noccasion to publish certain objections to Mr. Warner’s scheme, which was\r\nfinally rejected by the Silver party; and, with that rejection, there is\r\nprobably an end to all proposals for creating a purely silver paper\r\ncurrency. As a brief exposition of one phase of this controversy, it may\r\nperhaps be permissible to reproduce here the views then expressed:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Warner’s measure virtually concedes that the coinage of the\r\n    silver dollar has already been carried to a point that threatens\r\n    serious danger to the currency system of the country, and,\r\n    consequently, to the just relations between the creditor and\r\n    debtor classes. This confession from a representative of the\r\n    Silver party does not come a day too soon; and it would be\r\n    welcome, were it not accompanied with proposals that would\r\n    aggravate the evils which need to be remedied. Let us briefly\r\n    examine Mr. Warner’s plan.\r\n\r\n    First, it discontinues the current monthly coinage of silver\r\n    dollars required under the existing “Bland Act.” 2. It provides\r\n    that, in lieu of this current coinage, holders of silver bullion\r\n    may deposit any amount thereof in the United States Treasury. 3.\r\n    It requires that, against such unrestricted deposits of bullion,\r\n    the Government shall issue to the depositors “bullion\r\n    certificates,” expressing an amount of money equal to the market\r\n    value of the bullion at the time of its deposit. 4. These\r\n    certificates are to act as a new form of currency. The\r\n    Government could use them in liquidation of all its debts not\r\n    made expressly payable in gold; and it would be required to\r\n    accept them in payment of customs duties, taxes and public dues\r\n    generally. The national banks would be required to accept them\r\n    in payments between themselves. And, 5, the certificates are\r\n    made redeemable in lawful money, (i. e., either gold, silver or\r\n    U. S. notes), or at the option of the Treasury in silver bullion\r\n    at its current value at the time of redemption. These are the\r\n    more vital provisions of the scheme. Let us see what they\r\n    involve.\r\n\r\n    Against the whole plan there lies a very positive doubt of its\r\n    constitutionality. The Constitution empowers Congress to\r\n    authorize the coinage of gold and silver, and to make such coins\r\n    a legal tender; but there is nothing in the powers thus\r\n    conferred, nor in any powers conveyed by that instrument, that\r\n    can be construed into a right of the Government to receive\r\n    silver bullion on deposit. The Government can have no interest,\r\n    duty or function in connection with bullion, except so far as it\r\n    may be procured for the express purpose of coinage. It can have\r\n    no more power to assume the custody of bullion for the\r\n    accommodation of its producers than it has to store cotton, iron\r\n    or wheat for the convenience of the dealers in those\r\n    commodities. And when, in addition to assuming the grave\r\n    responsibilities of custodian, the Government undertakes to\r\n    issue receipts endowed with special privileges and attributes,\r\n    calculated to incorporate those receipts as an important part of\r\n    the currency system, it commits a breach of the true functions\r\n    of government and of the true constitutional limitations of\r\n    federal authority, which, it would seem, the Supreme Court\r\n    should unqualifiedly prohibit.\r\n\r\n    The provision made for the redemption of these proposed\r\n    certificates would be to the last degree objectionable. They are\r\n    payable in legal tender money, or, at the option of the\r\n    Government, in an equivalent value of silver bullion at its\r\n    current market price. If the Government chooses to redeem them\r\n    in lawful money, it exposes itself to a new and important demand\r\n    upon its legal tender notes or its gold: and as the amount of\r\n    greenbacks owned by the Treasury now runs so low as to prohibit\r\n    those notes being used for the purpose, it follows that the\r\n    redemption of the certificates would have to be made from the\r\n    Treasury stock of gold. Thus the operation of the scheme would\r\n    be to exchange the Government gold for silver bullion. What\r\n    could the silver men desire better? What could all other\r\n    interests dread more? It would be a direct step towards\r\n    incapacitating the Government for maintaining gold payments;\r\n    and, as such, would go far towards dissipating that broad\r\n    substratum of gold which is the sole means of preventing our\r\n    entire paper currency from depreciating to a level with the\r\n    bullion value of the silver dollar.\r\n\r\n    It is thus clear that the Government would be ultimately driven\r\n    to redeem the certificates in silver bullion. What does that\r\n    imply? First, that the Treasury would have to stand the loss\r\n    upon the deposits of bullion that might arise from a fall in its\r\n    value. Take a case for illustration. A deposit is made of\r\n    1,000,000 ounces of gold at the current price of $1.10 per\r\n    ounce, the Treasury being required to issue against it\r\n    $1,100,000 of certificates. Later, when the price of silver has\r\n    fallen to say $1.05, the $1,100,000 of certificates is presented\r\n    for redemption, and 1,047,619 ounces of silver have to be\r\n    delivered, as the bullion equivalent at the current market\r\n    value. The Government thus loses 47,619 ounces of silver by the\r\n    transaction. Now, seeing what a handsome profit can be made by\r\n    thus depositing bullion at a higher price and withdrawing it at\r\n    a lower, are men so virtuous that we can depend on their not\r\n    working this Treasury silver mine to the utmost possible\r\n    advantage? With the hands of the Government thus tied, it would\r\n    be at the mercy of unprincipled speculators and could not escape\r\n    being mulcted to the extent of millions of dollars. The moment\r\n    such a bill was signed by the President, speculative\r\n    combinations would be formed with London bullion dealers; the\r\n    European stocks would be secured, and, after advancing the\r\n    price, would be sent to the United States Treasury. The next\r\n    step would be to force down the price; and then the certificates\r\n    would be presented to be redeemed by a much larger quantity of\r\n    silver than had been deposited against them. And thus the game\r\n    would go on continuously, the Government being the loser in\r\n    every transaction. A finer scheme for the benefit of speculators\r\n    could not have been conceived; but for legitimate interests, in\r\n    many ways dependent on the value of silver, nothing could be\r\n    more serious.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing in Mr. Warner’s measure to prevent the United\r\n    States Treasury from being saddled with as much of the European\r\n    stocks of silver as speculators find it to their interest to\r\n    send here, in addition to the product of our own mines; and for\r\n    such deposits the Treasury would be compelled to pay whatever\r\n    artificial price it suited the operators to determine. And what\r\n    does such a transfer involve? First, that we should have to ship\r\n    so much more gold to Europe, making the operation a virtual\r\n    exchange of Europe’s silver for America’s gold; next, that the\r\n    United States Government would thus be made to bear the sole\r\n    weight and responsibility of carrying the WORLD’S surplus of\r\n    silver; next, that, as a consequence, England, Germany, and\r\n    other nations would become still more reluctant than they now\r\n    are to negotiate for an international settlement of the silver\r\n    question; next, that the Government would be so handicapped with\r\n    its enormous load of silver as to place it at an utter\r\n    disadvantage in such negotiations; next, that the Government\r\n    would be exposed to immense losses in assuming such vast\r\n    responsibilities; and, next, that the large issues of\r\n    certificates to be made against this mass of bullion would be a\r\n    forcible and artificial inflation of the currency, which could\r\n    not fail to produce disaster to all the material interests of\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n    Of course, such an arrangement would be all that the silver\r\n    interests could desire. For them, indeed, it would be a far\r\n    better protection than the Bland Act. But this advantage would\r\n    be only temporary; for when the scheme broke down of its own\r\n    weight, as sooner or later it must, the miners would be exposed\r\n    to ruin from the consequent derangements.\r\n\r\n    The only wholesome treatment of this question is to repeal the\r\n    Silver Coinage Act. That done, we should add $25,000,000 to our\r\n    yearly exports, instead of locking up so much of our national\r\n    product as dead capital in the Treasury; while that increase of\r\n    exports would give us a greater command of European gold and\r\n    thereby strengthen our international position in this question.\r\n    Europe, and especially England, would then be compelled to\r\n    earnestly consider measures for placing the double standard upon\r\n    a broad and lasting international basis; and as such a\r\n    disposition began to manifest itself, the silver market would so\r\n    far sympathize as to amply compensate producers for any losses\r\n    they might suffer from a temporary fall in bullion.\r\n\r\n                                                        HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\nBad as the situation is, in respect to this vast mass of the world’s\r\ncirculating medium, yet it is far from being a hopeless one. The more\r\nserious it becomes, the nearer will be the remedy. The derangements to\r\ncommerce and to immense vested interests must ultimately become so\r\nserious, that the nations which now obstruct the application of a remedy\r\nwill be compelled to submit to the necessities of an imperative danger,\r\nand the end will probably be that a coinage union will be established\r\nbetween the great nations, on a basis broad enough to give stability to\r\nthis form of money beyond all possibility of future disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n              THE LABOR QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARMONY BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CAPITAL AND LABOR NECESSARY FOR\r\n    BUSINESS PROSPERITY.—IF MANUFACTURERS SHOULD COMBINE TO REGULATE\r\n    WAGES, THE ARRANGEMENT COULD ONLY BE TEMPORARY.—THE WORKINGMEN ARE\r\n    TAKEN CARE OF BY THE NATURAL LAWS OF TRADE.—COMPETITION AMONG THE\r\n    CAPITALISTS SUSTAINS THE RATE OF WAGES.—OPINION OF JOHN STUART MILL\r\n    ON THIS SUBJECT.—COMPELLING A UNIFORM RATE OF PAY IS A GROSS\r\n    INJUSTICE TO THE MOST SKILFUL WORKMEN.—THE TENDENCY OF THE TRADES\r\n    UNIONS TO DEBAR THE WORKINGMAN FROM SOCIAL ELEVATION.—THE POWER OF\r\n    THE UNIONS BROUGHT TO A TEST.—THE UNIVERSAL FAILURE OF THE\r\n    STRIKES.—REVOLUTIONARY DEMANDS OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR.—GOULD AND\r\n    THE STRIKES ON THE MISSOURI PACIFIC, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no influence to which business circles are more sensitive than\r\nthe disruption of harmony between capital and labor. Whatever affects\r\nthe productiveness of labor affects, more directly than any other cause,\r\nthe national prosperity and the welfare of all classes of society. The\r\nvalue of the vast aggregate of corporate property represented on the\r\nStock Exchange is vitally dependent on the maintenance of such relations\r\nbetween the employed and employing classes as contribute to the highest\r\nwelfare of both and to the largest possible national production; and,\r\ntherefore, whatever tends to imperil such relations becomes a source of\r\nserious disturbance to the stock market, to financial interests at\r\nlarge, and to the best interests of labor itself.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be an idea, in certain quarters, that the modern\r\nconcentration of capital into large masses has made it necessary for\r\nworkmen also to organize themselves into large bodies, sinking their\r\nindividual rights and liberties and selling their labor _en masse_. For\r\nmy part, I am unable to see the force of this reasoning, although I\r\ncannot but respect the ability of some authorities by which it is\r\nsanctioned. It seems to assume that large employers of labor have more\r\npower to depress wages than smaller ones; and from this it is inferred\r\nthat it is necessary for workmen to combine to protect themselves\r\nagainst this supposed increased exposure to aggression from capital. But\r\nis either the premise or the conclusion sound? In order to concede the\r\nassumption we must suppose that large employers can cease to be\r\ncompetitors for labor; for in no other way can they depress wages. But\r\nthis can never happen; for capitalists will always produce to the\r\nfullest extent compatible with an average rate of profit, and this\r\nensures the largest possible demand for labor and, therefore, the\r\nhighest possible rate of wages. If employers combined to force the rate\r\nof wages down, as workmen do to force it up, they would undoubtedly be\r\nable to compel a temporary reduction in the remuneration of labor.\r\n\r\nBut, of necessity, such an artificial depression of wages could only be\r\ntemporary; for what was thus taken by force from labor would make\r\nmanufacturing so unusually profitable that new capital would be\r\nimmediately attracted to it, and the consequent additional demand for\r\nlabor would necessitate an advance in wages, which the combined\r\nmanufacturers would be compelled to pay. As a matter of fact,\r\nmanufacturers do not combine to regulate wages, not only because of the\r\nreasons just stated, but also because they know that no such combination\r\ncould be maintained in the face of the jealousies and conflicting\r\ninterests that always exist among them. If, then, it is true that\r\nmanufacturers are compelled by the necessities of competition to pay as\r\nmuch for labor as it is for the time-being worth, and, if they do not\r\nand cannot combine to depress wages, I am unable to see where arises the\r\nnecessity for the workmen to combine for the purpose of protecting\r\nthemselves against capital.\r\n\r\nThe workingmen are taken care of by the natural laws of trade far more\r\nperfectly than they can be by any artificial arrangement; and trades\r\nunions are simply an intrusion upon the domain of those laws, without\r\nthe power to supplement or perfect their operation, and with a certainty\r\nof obstructing and perverting their tendency, with the inevitable result\r\nof mischief to all parties. If the unions do occasionally get an advance\r\nin wages, it would have come by the natural laws of competition among\r\nthe capitalists. It might be delayed for a time, but if you calculate\r\nthe loss of wages and suffering entailed by the strike, I think the\r\nworkmen would be safer in the end to wait for the natural advance. I am\r\nclearly borne out in this view of the case of the capitalist by that\r\ngreat political economist, philosopher and thinker, John Stuart Mill,\r\nwho was certainly no enthusiastic friend of the capitalist, and is an\r\nacknowledged friend of labor as widely as his writings are known, which\r\nis almost as extensive as civilization itself.\r\n\r\nAfter laying down the principles of Socialism, Mill says:\r\n\r\n    “Next, it must be observed that Socialists generally, and even\r\n    the most enlightened of them, have a very imperfect and one\r\n    sided notion of the operation of competition. They see half its\r\n    effects, and overlook the other half; they regard it as an\r\n    agency for grinding down every one’s remuneration—for obliging\r\n    every one to accept less wages for his labor, or a less price\r\n    for his commodities, which would be true only if every one had\r\n    to dispose of his labor _or his commodities to some great\r\n    monopolist, and the competition were all on one side_. They\r\n    forget that competition is the cause of high prices and values\r\n    as well as of low; that the buyers of labor and of commodities\r\n    compete with one another as well as the sellers; and that if it\r\n    is competition _which keeps the prices of labor and commodities\r\n    as low as they are_, it is competition which prevents them from\r\n    falling still lower. In truth, when competition is perfectly\r\n    free on both sides, its tendency is not specially either to\r\n    raise or to lower the price of articles, but to equalize it; to\r\n    level inequalities of remuneration, and to reduce all to a\r\n    general average, a result which, in so far as realized (no doubt\r\n    very imperfectly), is, on Socialistic principles, desirable. But\r\n    if, disregarding for the time that part of the effects of\r\n    competition which consists in keeping up prices, we fix our\r\n    attention on its effect in keeping them down, and contemplate\r\n    this effect in reference solely to the interest of the laboring\r\n    classes, it would seem that if competition keeps down wages, and\r\n    so gives a motive to the laboring classes to withdraw the labor\r\n    market from the full influence of competition, if they can, it\r\n    must on the other hand have credit for keeping down the prices\r\n    of the articles on which wages are expended, to the great\r\n    advantage of those who depend on wages. To meet this\r\n    consideration Socialists, as we said in our quotation from M.\r\n    Louis Blanc, are reduced to affirm that the low prices of\r\n    commodities produced by competition are delusive, and lead in\r\n    the end to higher prices than before, because when the richest\r\n    competitor has got rid of all his rivals, he commands the market\r\n    and can demand any price he pleases. Now, the commonest\r\n    experience shows that this state of things, under really free\r\n    competition, is wholly imaginary. The richest competitor neither\r\n    does nor can get rid of all his rivals, and establish himself in\r\n    the exclusive possession of the market; and it is not the fact\r\n    that any important branch of industry or commerce formerly\r\n    divided among many has become, or shows any tendency to become,\r\n    the monopoly of a few.\r\n\r\n    “The kind of policy described is sometimes possible where, as in\r\n    the case of railways, the only competition possible is between\r\n    two or three great companies, the operations being on too vast a\r\n    scale to be within the reach of individual capitalists; and this\r\n    is one of the reasons why businesses which require to be carried\r\n    on by great joint-stock enterprises cannot be trusted to\r\n    competition, but, when not reserved by the State to itself,\r\n    ought to be carried on under conditions prescribed, and from\r\n    time to time, varied by the State, for the purpose of insuring\r\n    to the public a cheaper supply of its wants than would be\r\n    afforded by private interest in the absence of sufficient\r\n    competition. But in the ordinary branches of industry no one\r\n    rich competitor has it in his power to drive out all the smaller\r\n    ones. Some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands\r\n    of many small producers and dealers into a smaller number of\r\n    larger ones; but the cases in which this happens are those in\r\n    which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of\r\n    more powerful machinery, more efficient, by more expensive\r\n    processes, or a better organized and more economical mode of\r\n    carrying on business, and thus enables the large dealer\r\n    legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper\r\n    than can be done on the small scale; to the great advantage of\r\n    the consumers, and therefore of the laboring classes, and\r\n    diminishing, _pro tanto_, the waste of the resources of the\r\n    community so much complained of by Socialists, the unnecessary\r\n    multiplication of mere distributors, and of the various other\r\n    classes whom Fourier calls the parasites of industry. When this\r\n    change is effected, the larger capitalists, either individual or\r\n    joint-stock, among which the business is divided, are seldom, if\r\n    ever, in any considerable branch of commerce, so few as that\r\n    competition shall not continue to act between them; so that the\r\n    saving in cost, which enabled them to undersell the small\r\n    dealers, continues afterwards, as at first, to be passed on, in\r\n    lower prices, to their customers. The operation, therefore, of\r\n    competition in keeping down the prices of commodities, including\r\n    those on which wages are expended, is not illusive but real, and\r\n    we may add, is a growing, not a declining fact.”\r\n\r\nOne principle of the unions is exceedingly unjust to the workingmen to\r\nthe last degree. It starts with the assumption that all workmen are\r\nequal in their capacity as to the quality of service or work and the\r\nquantity of production; and upon this false assumption is based the\r\ninjustice of compelling all members to bind themselves to a uniform rate\r\nof pay. A greater injustice and a more flagrant inequity cannot be found\r\nin the whole range of the world’s social institutions; nor is the wrong\r\nthe less culpable because the members voluntarily inflict it upon\r\nthemselves; for as “no man liveth unto himself” but has dependents for\r\nwhom he is bound to do the best in his power, so no man is free to throw\r\naway to the less industrious or less competent what his superior\r\nabilities and industry have earned for himself.\r\n\r\nThis levelling system is not only in defiance of the law of varied\r\nendowment which the Creator has incorporated into the constitution of\r\nhumanity, but it tends to bind into one cast-iron man the entire working\r\ncommunity, debarring them from all chances of progress and consigning\r\nthem to a degrading condition of semi-slavery or serfdom. Time was when\r\nthe way was clear to any workingman in this country to the highest\r\npositions of wealth, or of social standing or political influence. As a\r\nmatter of fact, a large proportion of our present successful merchants,\r\nand not a few even of our millionaires, are men who have risen from the\r\nranks of labor. The first steps in their progress were won by the\r\nsuperiority of their skill or faithfulness as workmen, which qualified\r\nthem to rise step by step to higher achievements. Then, the workman was\r\nfree to rise according to his abilities and his character; he was the\r\nfree ruler of his own destiny. Now, it seems the tendency of the trades\r\nunions is to obliterate all such distinctions and virtually debar the\r\nworkman from the possibility of earning a rank among his fellowmen\r\nproportioned to his merits; and on this plan the American workman would\r\nbe as completely cut off from the chances of social elevation, as was\r\nthe American slave twenty-five years ago. This would be a terrible\r\ndegradation, of which every man who enjoys the rights of American\r\ncitizenship should deem himself incapable and feel ashamed.\r\n\r\nHowever much political leaders, and even some who rejoice in the\r\nreputation of economists, may feel disposed to regard these combinations\r\nas a social necessity of the time, and an institution that has come to\r\nstay, I cannot resist the conviction that the trades-union movement has\r\nalready seen its culmination and is destined to a steady disintegration,\r\nunless the system is greatly modified. The principle of combination is\r\nuseless unless it can be successfully employed to compel employers to\r\naccept the terms of the employees. In fact, it has been almost the sole\r\nobject of the unions to employ it, through the agency of strikes, to\r\ncompel the acquiescence of capital. Up to a recent period, it has been\r\nlargely successful in this sense. So long as employers could at all\r\nafford to comply with the demands of labor, they would make considerable\r\nsacrifices to avoid the inconvenience and loss connected with the\r\ninterruption of their operations involved in a strike. At last, however,\r\nthe workingmen advanced their demands to a pitch so seriously\r\nthreatening to industry and so vitally dangerous to the material\r\ninterests of the country at large, that employers saw, with common\r\nconsent, that the time had come when a square issue must be made with\r\nthis modern invasion on their rights.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1886 will always be memorable, for its having brought to a\r\nfair test the power and principles of trades-unionism. Strikes were\r\nsuddenly initiated on a stupendous scale, upon the railroads, among the\r\nwestern factories, and among the larger employers in the Middle States,\r\npartly to enforce demands for higher wages, partly to shorten the time\r\nof work to eight hours a day, and above all, to compel employers to\r\nrecognize the leaders of the unions in determining the conditions of\r\nemployment and to submit all disputes between the two parties to\r\narbitration. Employers, simultaneously, but without any concert of\r\naction, met the challenge squarely. They refused to concede the demands\r\nmade; they in many instances declined to recognize the officers of the\r\nunions; they proceeded promptly to fill the places of the strikers with\r\nnon-union men, and refused to make formal conditions with returning\r\nstrikers; they brought to bear upon the leaders of the strikes the laws\r\nagainst conspiracy; and they took the “boycotters” before the courts.\r\nThe result of this treatment was an almost universal failure of the\r\nstrikers; the declaration by the courts that the compulsory methods of\r\nthe unions are illegal, and in the nature of conspiracies; the throwing\r\nout of employment of tens of thousands of union employees, and the\r\nexhaustion of the funds raised by the unions for enforcing their\r\ncoercive tactics.\r\n\r\nThe result of the contest was that, within one brief month, the power of\r\nthe unions was shown to be weakness itself; employers everywhere\r\ndiscovered the intrinsic importance of the combinations they had so much\r\nbefore dreaded, and very many respectable and reflecting members of the\r\nunions felt themselves discredited in the eyes of the public, while\r\ntheir faith in the efficiency of their system of supposed protection was\r\nseriously shaken. After this, if I am not seriously mistaken, employers\r\nwill find that they have much less to fear from trades-unions than they\r\nhad once supposed. A defeat so fundamental as this, is likely to be\r\nfollowed by the gradual dispersion of the formidable array of united\r\nworkmen. Such a result is no more than is to be reasonably expected from\r\nan organization based upon no great truth and no sound principle, but\r\nresting upon popular ignorance and misconception of the natural laws\r\ngoverning society.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the recent strikes, I had occasion to make\r\nfrequent allusions to the course of events, from which I may be\r\npermitted to make the following quotations:\r\n\r\n(The following appeared on the 3d of May.)\r\n\r\n    “The Knights of Labor have undertaken to test, upon a large\r\n    scale, the application of compulsion as a means of enforcing\r\n    their demands. The point to be determined is, whether capital or\r\n    labor shall, in future, determine the terms upon which the\r\n    invested resources of the nation are to be employed.\r\n\r\n    “To the employer it is a question whether his individual rights\r\n    as to the control of his property shall be so far overborne as\r\n    not only to deprive him of his freedom, but also expose him to\r\n    interference seriously impairing the value of his capital. To\r\n    the employees, it is a question whether, by the force of\r\n    coercion, they can wrest, to their own profit, powers and\r\n    control, which, in every civilized community, are secured as the\r\n    most sacred and inalienable rights of the employer.\r\n\r\n    “This issue is so absolutely revolutionary of the moral\r\n    relations between labor and capital, that it has naturally\r\n    produced a partial paralysis of business, especially among\r\n    industries whose operations involve contracts extending into the\r\n    future. There has been at no time any serious apprehensions that\r\n    such an anarchical movement could succeed, so long as American\r\n    citizens have a clear perception of their rights and their true\r\n    interests; but it has been distinctly perceived that this war\r\n    could not fail to create a divided, if not a hostile feeling,\r\n    between the two great classes of society; that it must hold in\r\n    check not only a large extent of ordinary business operations,\r\n    but also the undertaking of those new enterprises which\r\n    contribute to our national progress, and that the commercial\r\n    markets must be subjected to serious embarrassments.\r\n\r\n    “From the nature of the case, however, this labor disease must\r\n    soon end one way or another; and there is not much difficulty in\r\n    foreseeing what its termination will be. The demands of the\r\n    Knights and their sympathizers, whether openly expressed or\r\n    temporarily concealed, are so utterly revolutionary of the\r\n    inalienable rights of the citizen, and so completely subversive\r\n    of social order, that the whole community has come to a firm\r\n    conclusion that those pretensions must be resisted to the last\r\n    extremity of endurance and authority; and that the present is\r\n    the best opportunity for meeting the issue firmly and upon its\r\n    merits. The organizations have sacrificed the sympathy which\r\n    lately was entertained for them, on account of inequities\r\n    existing in certain employments; they stand discredited and\r\n    distrusted before the community at large as impracticable,\r\n    unjust and reckless; and, occupying this attitude before the\r\n    public, their cause is gone and their organization doomed to\r\n    failure. They have opened the flood gates to the immigration of\r\n    foreign labor, which is already pouring in by tens of thousands;\r\n    and they have set a premium on non-union labor, which will be\r\n    more sought after than ever, and will not be slow to secure\r\n    superior earnings by making arrangements with employers upon\r\n    such terms and for such hours as may best suit their interests.\r\n    Thus, one great advantage will incidentally come out of this\r\n    crisis beneficial to the workingman, who, by standing aloof from\r\n    the dead-level system of the unions, will be able to earn\r\n    according to his capacity, and thereby maintain his chances for\r\n    rising from the rank of the employee to that of the employer.\r\n    This result cannot be long delayed, because not only is loss and\r\n    suffering following close upon the heels of the strikers, but\r\n    the imprudences of their leaders are breeding dissatisfaction\r\n    among the rank and file of the organizations, which if much\r\n    further protracted, will gravely threaten their cohesion. It is\r\n    by no means certain that we may not see a further spread of\r\n    strikes, and possibly with even worse forms of violence than we\r\n    have yet witnessed; but, so long as a way to the end is seen,\r\n    with a chance of that end demonstrating to the organizations\r\n    that their aspirations to control capital are impossible dreams,\r\n    the temporary evils will be borne with equanimity. The coolness\r\n    with which the past phases of the strikes have been endured,\r\n    shows that the steady judgment of our people may be trusted to\r\n    keep them calm under any further disturbance that may arise.\r\n\r\n    “Prior to the strike in the Missouri Pacific, Jay Gould was one\r\n    of the most hated men in the people. He was anxious to have\r\n    public respect and sympathy. He had made all the money he\r\n    wanted, and was willing to spend part of it in gaining the\r\n    respect and honor of the country. What his money could not do\r\n    for him this strike on the Missouri Pacific has done. The\r\n    sympathy and good-will which previously were with the strikers\r\n    have been shifted from them to him. There is no doubt that the\r\n    strikers selected the Missouri Pacific because it was a property\r\n    with which Gould was known to be most largely identified, and\r\n    because they thought that general execration would be poured out\r\n    on him in any event. But, instead of injuring Mr. Gould, they\r\n    have done him inestimable service.\r\n\r\n    “The timely and forcible action of Mayor Harrison, of Chicago,\r\n    will put dynamiters and rioters where they belong, and thus\r\n    divide the sheep from the goats in a very short time. If\r\n    officials would sink political bias, the country would soon be\r\n    rid of law-breakers and disturbers of the peace. As this plan of\r\n    treatment has now been adopted, it will be far reaching in its\r\n    effect, and stop mob gatherings, riotous speech-making, and\r\n    other such bad incentives, which recently have been so\r\n    conspicuous in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and elsewhere. The\r\n    laboring classes, who are parties to the strike, will now have\r\n    an opportunity to retire to their homes, where there will be\r\n    more safety than in the streets, which will bring to them\r\n    reflection. They will then soon become satisfied that they are\r\n    the aggrieved parties, and the not unlikely result will be their\r\n    turning upon their leaders, who have deceived them.\r\n\r\n    “There have been numerous vacancies created by the strikers\r\n    voluntarily resigning. There has been no difficulty in filling\r\n    these vacancies by those who are equally capable, if not more\r\n    so, from other countries flocking to our shores. The steam ferry\r\n    between this country and Europe has demonstrated this by the\r\n    steamer just arrived in six days and ten hours from European\r\n    shores to our own. As the separation between the oppressed\r\n    operatives of the Old World and America is thus reduced to\r\n    hours, Europe will quickly send to us all the labor we need to\r\n    meet all such emergencies.\r\n\r\n    “The laboring man in this bounteous and hospitable country has\r\n    no ground for complaint. His vote is potential, and he is\r\n    elevated thereby to the position of man. Under the government of\r\n    this nation, the effect is to elevate the standard of the human\r\n    race and not to degrade it. In too many other nations it is the\r\n    reverse. What, therefore, has the laborer to complain of in\r\n    America? By exciting strikes and encouraging discontent he\r\n    stands in the way of the elevation of his class and of mankind.\r\n\r\n    “The tide of emigration to this country, now so large, makes\r\n    peaceful strikes perfectly harmless in themselves, because the\r\n    places of those who vacate good situations are easily filled by\r\n    newcomers. When disturbances occur under the cloak of strikes it\r\n    is a different matter, as law and order are then set at\r\n    defiance. The recent outbreaks in Chicago, which resulted in the\r\n    assassination of a number of valiant policemen through a few\r\n    cowardly Polish Nihilists firing a bomb of dynamite in their\r\n    midst, was the worst thing that could have been done for the\r\n    cause of the present labor agitation, as it alienates all\r\n    sympathy from them. It is much to the credit, however, of\r\n    Americans and Irishmen that, during the recent uprisings, none\r\n    of them have taken part in any violent measures whatsoever, nor\r\n    have they shown any sympathy with such conduct.\r\n\r\n    “If the labor troubles are to be regarded as only a transient\r\n    interruption of the course of events, it is next to be asked,\r\n    what may be anticipated when those obstructions disappear? We\r\n    have still our magnificent country, with all the resources that\r\n    have made it so prosperous and so progressive beyond the record\r\n    of all nations. There is no abatement of our past ratio of\r\n    increase of population; no limitation of the new sources of\r\n    wealth awaiting development; no diminution of the means\r\n    necessary to the utilization of the unbounded riches of the\r\n    soil, the mine, and the forest. Our inventive genius has\r\n    suffered no eclipse. In the practical application of what may be\r\n    called the commercial sciences, we retain our lead of the world.\r\n    As pioneers of new sources of wealth, we are producing greater\r\n    results than all the combined new colonizing efforts which have\r\n    recently excited the aspirations of European governments. To the\r\n    over-crowded populations of the Old World the United States\r\n    still presents attractions superior to those of any other\r\n    country, as is demonstrated by the recent sudden revival of\r\n    emigration from Great Britain and the continent to our shores.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n            AN IMPORTANT SYNOPSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RESUME IN BRIEF OF THE LEADING EVENTS CONNECTED WITH WALL STREET\r\n    AFFAIRS FOR SEVENTY-SEVEN YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December, 1816._—The first savings banks in the United States went into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n_July, 1820._—Great financial distress throughout America. The causes\r\nwere excessive importations and a deranged currency.\r\n\r\n_August, 1833._—There was great commercial distress, caused by\r\ncontraction by the United States Bank. The bank defended its course on\r\nthe ground of the evident hostilities of the Administration, the public\r\ndeposits, amounting to $10,000,000, having been withdrawn by order of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n_May, 1837._—In this year commercial distress prevailed throughout the\r\nUnited States. On May 10th all the banks in New York city, by common\r\nconsent, suspended specie payments, banks throughout the country\r\nfollowing the example. In New York about 300 large failures took place.\r\nIn Boston 168 failures were reported. In New Orleans houses stopped\r\npayment owing an aggregate of $27,000,000.\r\n\r\n_May, 1838._—The banks of New York and New England resumed payment after\r\nthe suspension due to the panic of 1837. The Philadelphia banks resumed\r\nin August, 1838, and in January, 1839, there was nominal resumption\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n_July, 1840._—The bill organizing the United States Sub-Treasury became\r\na law. The act was repealed in 1841, but was re-enacted in 1846.\r\n\r\n_October, 1842._—The first sub-marine telegraph cable, the invention of\r\nProf. Morse, was laid between Governors’ Island and the Battery, New\r\nYork, October 18th.\r\n\r\n_January, 1844._—The first telegraph line in the United States was\r\nerected. The telegraph was invented by Morse in 1837.\r\n\r\n_August, 1851._—The depression of this year reached its height on the\r\n13th. A bad credit system had been in vogue, trade with California had\r\nnot met expectations, imports had been large, exports of gold heavy,\r\ncotton declined in Europe, the banks contracted, property was sacrificed\r\nto raise ready money, mercantile credit was disturbed everywhere, and\r\ndistress was general in all the cities. In Wall Street large blocks of\r\nstock were unloaded and the market was broken. Erie went from 90 to 68¾.\r\nLater in the month money became easier, prices advanced, and the market\r\nresumed its ordinary aspect.\r\n\r\n_October, 1851._—Panic regarding the value of State money. The\r\nMetropolitan Bank made war on the country banks to compel them to\r\ndeposit with it against their notes, which were extensively circulated\r\nin the city. After receiving their bills the Metropolitan Bank demanded\r\ntheir redemption in specie. This led to many suspensions. The bills were\r\nwell secured by State stocks, and the Metropolitan continued to receive\r\nthem. As brokers refused to take State moneys of any kind there was a\r\nrush to the Metropolitan, and a panic prevailed. Ultimately the brokers\r\nbought the bills at a discount and made large profits. Their purchases\r\ngradually restored confidence, but not before four country banks had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n_July, 1853._—A panic in the stock market in consequence of bank\r\ncontraction. The State Legislature enacted that the banks should publish\r\nweekly, in the New York _Times_, statements of their condition. In\r\npreparing for this statement the banks called in a large portion of\r\ntheir loans, and ran after each other for specie. The panic was of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n_October, 1853._—Simeon Draper, a railroad banker, failed.—Stocks were\r\ndepressed on the 19th, in consequence of bank contraction. There were\r\nseveral failures.\r\n\r\n_January, 1854._.—California defaulted in its interest on the 1st, and\r\nthere was much alarm in financial circles in consequence.\r\n\r\n_February, 1854._—Heavy failures in California.\r\n\r\n_May, 1854._—The New York, Newfoundland & London Telegraph Company was\r\norganized, and was the first company to attempt Atlantic cable\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\n_July, 1854._—Robert Schuyler, President of the New York & New Haven\r\nRailroad Company, fraudulently issued nearly $2,000,000 stock of the\r\ncompany. About the same time fraudulent entries, made by Secretary Kyle,\r\nwere discovered in the stock ledger of the Harlem Company, amounting to\r\nabout $470,000. Frauds were also discovered in the affairs of the Parker\r\nVein and the Vermont Central railway companies. In consequence there was\r\na rapid decline in the stock market, and many suspensions occurred in\r\nNew York, Boston and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n_September, 1854._—A severe twist in Erie stock on the 13th.\r\n\r\n_October, 1854._—Frauds on the Ocean, American Exchange and National\r\nbanks were discovered.\r\n\r\n_December, 1854._—There was a severe run on the savings banks of the\r\ncity of New York on the 9th.\r\n\r\n_September, 1855._—A financial panic in San Francisco and many failures\r\nof prominent bankers.\r\n\r\n_September, 1856._—Charles B. Huntington committed forgeries amounting\r\nto $15,000,000 or $20,000,000. The forgeries were used as collateral\r\nsecurity for raising money, and for a time were taken up before\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n_April, 1857._—Freight-train men on the Baltimore & Ohio struck. Trains\r\nwere molested and many fights occurred. The military were called out and\r\na desperate fight ensued, in which many were killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n_August, 1857._—The financial panic of this year began on the failure of\r\nthe Ohio Trust Company, with liabilities about $7,000,000. Banks either\r\nfailed or suspended specie payments everywhere. The New York banks\r\nresumed in December. Business was generally prostrated until the\r\nfollowing spring, when improvement became perceptible.\r\n\r\n_July, 1860._—Congress authorized a war loan of $250,000,000. The\r\nNational debt was $64,640,838.11. It reached $2,756,431,571, its\r\ngreatest point, in 1885.\r\n\r\n_August, 1860._—Treasury notes to the amount of $50,000,000 were\r\nauthorized by Congress.—The first well ever sunk for oil, and the first\r\npetroleum ever obtained by boring.

Ketchum, a junior partner in a prominent\r\nbanking house in New York, forged gold certificates to the extent of\r\n$1,500,000, and they were negotiated at the banks. In addition he\r\nabstracted more than $3,000,000 from the vaults of the firm. The firm\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n_October, 1865._—Call loans were made as high a per cent. and a heavy\r\ncommission added. Tight money checked a rise in stocks. Money was wanted\r\nin the West for the moving of crops. Relief came on the demand from the\r\nWest subsiding, and by temporary loans from the Sub-Treasury to the\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n_November, 1865._—Prairie du Chien common stock was cornered. On the 6th\r\n29,000 shares were bought at about 40. The trap being sprung 200 and\r\nmore was demanded, and the shorts settled at rates ranging from 110 to\r\n210. There were several failures.

The market\r\nverged on panic. People were afraid of the course of the Government in\r\nselling upwards of $12,000,000 gold.\r\n\r\n_April, 1866._—Michigan Southern was cornered. The price rose from 84 to\r\n104. The pool closed out and the price dropped to 80 within 24 hours.\r\nOther corners were made in the same month in Reading, Rock Island,\r\nHudson River, Cleveland & Pittsburg and Northwestern preferred. Money\r\nwas plentiful and speculation was rampant.\r\n\r\n_May, 1866._—The marketing of Erie stock by Daniel Drew caused a drop in\r\nits price from 74½ on May 18th to 60½ on May 31st.

Prices\r\ndeclined about 10 points, and outsiders lost upwards of $25,000,000.\r\n\r\n_December, 1866._—Northwestern preferred and Cumberland Coal were\r\ncornered.\r\n\r\n_January, 1867._—Prices broke on the 18th with a rush. Cumberland Coal\r\ndeclined 55 points, and the general list went off in sympathy. There\r\nwere several failures. Money was tied up by bear operators.—President\r\nYelverton, of the Bank of North America, on learning of the failure of\r\nA. J.

The associated banks lost $20,000,000\r\nin deposits and $12,000,000 in legal tenders, with a reduction of only\r\n$9,000,000 in loans. Special efforts were made to break the stock\r\nmarket, but the bull leaders had provided themselves with time loans,\r\nrunning to the end of the year, and were thus enabled to hold prices.\r\n\r\n_November, 1868._—Erie was cornered, and a panic extending through the\r\nwhole list occurred. It was helped by the inability of a leading\r\noperator, a director of St. Paul, to meet puts on that stock. The common\r\nand preferred fell about 20 points. Erie made an extraordinary issue of\r\nshares. Later on money became more plentiful, prices advanced and the\r\nmarket became very strong.\r\n\r\n_April, 1869._—A bill to consolidate the New York Central and the Hudson\r\nRiver railroad companies passed the Legislature.\r\n\r\n_May, 1869._—The New York Stock Exchange and the Open Board of Brokers\r\nwere amalgamated under one management.

Active stocks advanced to prices never before reached.\r\nNew York Central sold at 192-5/8.

Transactions ran up into hundreds of millions, and\r\nbusiness was conducted with so much confusion that bids running from 135\r\nto 160 were made at one and the same time in different parts of the\r\nroom. Between 11 and 12 o’clock the shorts settled on a basis of\r\n148@158, the market price being 5@15 higher. At noon it was officially\r\nannounced that the Government would sell gold next day and buy bonds,\r\nand within 15 minutes the price had fallen to 135, and the great\r\nspeculation had collapsed.\r\n\r\n_April, 1870._—The cliques who had bought stocks on the decline after\r\nBlack Friday, started an upward movement in the last week of the month.\r\nThe public came in and top figures were reached about May 10.

The pool began buying at 114½\r\nand advanced it to 130-7/8. On liquidation the stock declined to 110.\r\nMany failures occurred and bad faith was charged.\r\n\r\n_October, 1871._—The week beginning October 9, 1871, was one of the most\r\neventful in the history of the Stock Exchange. The banks had expanded\r\nbeyond precedent and were compelled to contract loans to raise money for\r\ncrop purposes. The payment by France to Germany in settlement of war\r\nclaims caused the Bank of England rate to advance from 3 to 5 per cent.,\r\nand produced a feeling bordering on panic in London. The New York market\r\nwas very sensitive when news of the Chicago fire came. Prices broke 4@10\r\npoints. On Tuesday there was great excitement; sales were enormous and\r\nfluctuations wide. On Wednesday there was a rally on the belief that the\r\nGovernment would purchase 5-20s. The lowest prices, however, were made\r\non Thursday. On Friday there was more steadiness and prices were higher.\r\nThe bank statement was favorable and matters quieted down.\r\n\r\n_December, 1871._—The Ocean National Bank, the Union Square and the\r\nEighth National Bank failed. Money was scarce, but stocks were firmly\r\nheld. Operators and brokers were loaded up with stocks and they\r\nsustained prices, awaiting an opportunity to get out.\r\n\r\n_March, 1872._—The Erie revolution occurred. The Board of Directors was\r\noverthrown, and Jay Gould resigned the presidency. Gen. Dix became his\r\nsuccessor. The operation caused great activity in the stock market, and\r\nmoney became tight.\r\n\r\n_June, 1872._—Stock dividends on Lake Shore and Michigan Central were\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n_August, 1872._—Gold was cliqued.\r\n\r\n_September, 1872._—Erie was cornered. The Gould-Smith clique was short\r\nof it. The stock first became scarce on purchases by German brokers for\r\nforeign account. Then Drew became a heavy purchaser. At the same time\r\nthe German brokers were long of gold, and with the double idea of\r\npunishing them and compelling those carrying Erie to sell out the\r\nGould-Smith clique endeavored to lock up money. This plan was defeated\r\nby the refusal of two banks to pay out legal tenders on certified\r\nchecks. Just then, too, the Government bought $5,000,000 bonds and sold\r\nthe same amount of gold. This completely broke the speculative\r\nmanipulation of money, and a panic was averted. During the height of the\r\npanic there were no quotations for money. Among the failures of the week\r\nwere Northrup, Chick & Co., bankers, the Glenham Woolen Manufacturing\r\nCo., Paton & Co., dry goods, George Bird, Grinnell & Co., stock brokers,\r\nHoyt, Sprague & Co. and A. & W. Sprague. The banks suspended their\r\nweekly statements, and they were not resumed until late in November.\r\n\r\n_November, 1872._—Jay Gould was arrested on criminal charges based on\r\nhis management of the Erie Railroad. He surrendered securities, the face\r\nvalue of which was more than $9,000,000, in December.—Northwestern was\r\ncornered. It opened Nov. 20 at 83¾ and closed at 95. On Thursday it sold\r\nat 100, and at the close on Friday 200 was bid. On Saturday buying in\r\nunder the rule ran the price up to 230. The settlement was made on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday, when the price declined to par, the highest bid made\r\nbeing 85. Jay Gould, Horace F. Clark and Augustus Schell conducted the\r\ncorner, while the cornered were Drew and Henry N. Smith. It was one of\r\nthe most profitable corners ever made in Wall Street.\r\n\r\n_February, 1873._—There was a noted corner in Northwestern.\r\n\r\n_April, 1873._—The preliminary panic of the year occurred in this month.\r\nThe stock market was uneasy. The failure of a firm of silk importers was\r\nfollowed by that of Barker & Allen, the members of which were related to\r\nVanderbilt. Three other firms also failed. Confidence returned and quiet\r\nprevailed until the 26th, when the Atlantic Bank failed. This brought\r\nabout another depression, which was followed by a quick rally.\r\n\r\n_May, 1873._—Heavy break in Pacific Mail. The further retirement of\r\ngreenbacks was prohibited by Congress.\r\n\r\n_August, 1873._—Fraud was discovered in the issue of certain bonds of\r\nthe New York Central & Hudson River Railroad.\r\n\r\n_September, 1873._—The New York Warehouse & Security Company failed on\r\nthe 8th; Kenyon, Cox & Co., in which Daniel Drew was a special partner,\r\non the 13th; Jay Cooke & Co. on the 18th, and Fisk & Hatch on the 19th.\r\nInnumerable brokers failed. There were runs on the Fourth National Bank\r\nand the Union Trust Company. The secretary of the company was a\r\ndefaulter to the extent of $500,000, and its doors were closed. The Bank\r\nof the Commonwealth failed. There was a panic in the stock market, and\r\nthe excitement ran so high that the Governing Committee closed the\r\nExchange at 11 o’clock on Saturday, the 20th. The Gold Exchange Bank was\r\nunable to effect all the clearances, and dealers were unable to get\r\ntheir balances. The result was the temporary suspension of some dozen\r\nfirms. The Gold Exchange Bank having been enjoined by the courts from\r\nmaking the clearances, the Bank of New York undertook the job and failed\r\nin it. Next a committee of 20 was appointed to do the work, but it\r\nfailed also, because Smith, Gould & Martin refused to render a statement\r\nto it. The final settlements were made between members themselves.\r\nSmith, Gould & Martin, with contracts amounting to $9,000,000, settled\r\non a basis of 135. Business was resumed on Sept. 30.\r\n\r\n_December, 1873._—The Credit Mobilier was organized for the construction\r\nof the Union Pacific Railroad. It was composed of stockholders of the\r\nrailway company, and had a capital of $3,750,000. Profits were large,\r\nand the stock was quoted at 400. Certain Congressmen were given stock at\r\npar on their personal notes, the object being to gain their favor in\r\ncase adverse legislation was proposed. Oakes Ames, of Massachusetts, was\r\nexpelled from the House for his connection with the bribery, and James\r\nBrooks, of New York, for accepting bribes. Other Congressmen were\r\ncensured. A proposition to impeach Vice-President Colfax was reported\r\nagainst by the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n_January, 1874._—The value of the pound sterling was fixed by Congress\r\nat $4.86.65.\r\n\r\n_February, 1874._—Two letters, purporting to come from the Wabash and\r\nWestern Union companies, were received by the Stock Exchange, announcing\r\nan increase of stock by the directors. The market went off three points\r\nbefore it was discovered that the letters were forgeries.\r\n\r\n_April, 1874._—The President’s veto of the inflation bill unsettled\r\nprices and caused depression. The bears raided the market, causing a\r\nheavy decline, but a quick recovery followed.\r\n\r\n_February, 1875._—Wabash went in the hands of a receiver.\r\n\r\n_May, 1875._—A receiver for Erie was appointed.\r\n\r\n_July, 1875._—Duncan, Sherman & Co. failed.\r\n\r\n_August, 1875._—The Bank of California failed.

The bull movement of the year was at its height and\r\ntransactions were so numerous that it was impossible to record them all.\r\nThe drop came in November.\r\n\r\n_November, 1879._—William H. Vanderbilt sold 250,000 shares of New York\r\nCentral & Hudson River stock at 120 to a syndicate headed by J. S.\r\nMorgan & Co., of London. Early in the following year the same syndicate\r\ntook 100,000 shares on the same terms.\r\n\r\n_May, 1880._—Philadelphia & Reading Railway and Coal and Iron Company\r\nfailed. There was a flurry in the stock market in consequence.\r\n\r\n_June, 1880._—A scrip dividend of 100 per cent. to the holders of Rock\r\nIsland stock on the purchase and consolidation of the Iowa Southern and\r\nthe Missouri Northern with Rock Island.—A leading German Wall Street\r\nbanking house, in view of the large exports of gold, offered a premium\r\nof 1/2 of 1 per cent. for a call on $1,000,000 gold, the privilege to\r\nextend for one year.\r\n\r\n_November, 1880._—The Louisville & Nashville declared a 100 per cent.\r\nstock dividend.—Western Union declined from 104-7/8, on November 22d, to\r\n77½ on December 17th.—Jay Gould purchased most of the stock of the\r\nDenver, South Park & Pacific Railroad, in the following month a large\r\nblock of Iron Mountain and a majority of the International & Great\r\nNorthern.\r\n\r\n_December, 1880._—Seats in the New York Stock Exchange sold at $25,000.\r\nA great number of new securities were listed. So numerous were the\r\ncombinations, consolidations and extensions of railways that in many\r\ncases the analogy with former periods was lost, and comparisons as to\r\nearnings were of little value. In 1886 seats in the Exchange sold at\r\n$35,000. In December, 1870, when speculation was stagnant and the market\r\nwas clear of all outsiders, seats sold at $3,000.—B. G.

They were the\r\nprincipals in a combination to corner Java coffee, and met disaster in\r\nthe attempt.\r\n\r\n_January, 1881._—Western Union, American Union and Atlantic & Pacific\r\nconsolidated.

Bottom was touched on the 23d, the\r\nrecovery being based on talk of a settlement of the then existing trunk\r\nline rate war.—Richmond & Danville plunged from 219 to 130 and a\r\nsemi-panic ensued on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n_March, 1882._—To allay reports that he was in financial straits, Mr.\r\nGould, on the 13th, displayed his wealth. He took from a tin box\r\n$23,000,000 Western Union, $12,000,000 Missouri Pacific, $6,000,000\r\nManhattan Elevated, $2,000,000 Wabash common, and $10,000,000 bonds of\r\nMetropolitan, New York Elevated and Wabash preferred. He offered to show\r\n$30,000,000 additional railway stocks, but his visitors had seen enough.\r\n\r\n_October, 1882._—A syndicate headed by the late W. H. Vanderbilt\r\npurchased 124,800 shares of the common and 140,500 shares of the\r\npreferred stock of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railway at 13 and\r\n37 respectively. This stock afterwards became the property of the Lake\r\nShore & Michigan Southern Railway.\r\n\r\n_December, 1882._—The Municipal Bank of Shopin, Russia, failed with\r\nliabilities of $60,000,000.—The railway war in the Northwest lasted from\r\nSeptember until December 15. On the announcement of the settlement the\r\nmarket improved and the year closed with a better feeling all around.\r\n\r\n_February, 1883._—Western Union absorbed Mutual Union by lease, the\r\nrental being interest at 6 per cent. on $5,000,000 bonds and 6 per cent.\r\non $2,500,000 stock.\r\n\r\n_March, 1883._—A block of Hannibal & St. Joseph stock was sold to\r\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy.

The strike lasted a month and ended in failure.\r\n\r\n_October, 1883._—A notable feature of 1883 was the gigantic losses made\r\nin speculative operations. The failures of McGeoch, of Chicago, and\r\nRanger, of Liverpool, were notorious instances, but thousands of private\r\nindividuals were squeezed out by the pressure.—In the summer and fall of\r\nthis year there had been a shrinkage in prices of stocks, when, in\r\nOctober, the Northern Pacific Company announced a proposed issue of\r\n$20,000,000 new bonds. This precipitated a heavy decline in nearly the\r\nwhole list. The market became largely oversold, when a sharp twist was\r\nmade in a number of stocks, and prices advanced with great rapidity.\r\nNorthern Pacific preferred jumped from 56 to 78½ within a few days, and\r\nOregon & Transcontinental went from 34½ to 51. Then Vanderbilt came into\r\nthe market and put up Michigan Central from 77 to 96½, and the other\r\nVanderbilt stocks to a less extent. Great depression followed this\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\n_December, 1883._—The mercantile failures in 1883 amounted to\r\n$173,000,000, against $81,000,000 in 1881.—The triple alliance between\r\nUnion Pacific, Rock Island and St. Paul was made.—Villard resigned from\r\nOregon & Transcontinental and Oregon Railway & Navigation.\r\n\r\n_January, 1884._—Firmness in the market on the announcement that a\r\nsyndicate had made a large loan to Oregon & Transcontinental on the\r\npledge of its stocks. A quick move against the shorts caused a sharp\r\nadvance.—Henry Villard resigned the presidency of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailroad.—John J. Cisco & Co., New York bankers, failed.—The surplus\r\nreserve of the New York National banks was wiped out.—James R. Keene,\r\noperator in wheat, failed.\r\n\r\n_March, 1884._—There was a squeeze in New York Central.

White managed the pool.\r\nAnother move in the same stock was made later in the year. The pool\r\nclosed out at an average of 102.

Similar certificates, to the amount of\r\n$26,565,000, were issued in the panic of 1873.—The height of the panic\r\nwas reached on the 14th. The storm had been brewing for nearly three\r\nyears, but it was in no sense a commercial panic. Stock Exchange values\r\nhad shrunk to an unparalleled degree, and the crash was precipitated by\r\nthe developments regarding Grant & Ward, John C. Eno, Fish, of the\r\nMarine Bank, and a few others. The disturbance was over by July 1.—The\r\nMetropolitan Bank failed. Eno’s frauds on the Second National Bank\r\ndiscovered. George I. Seney failed. The Atlantic Bank failed.\r\n\r\n_June, 1884._—The greatest depression following the May panic was\r\nreached.

It was estimated\r\nat 1,800,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n_January, 1885._—Henry N. Smith, a noted bear operator, failed, and\r\ncarried down with him the brokerage firm of William Heath & Co.\r\n\r\n_November, 1885._—The trunk lines came to an agreement and advanced\r\nrates. This gave confidence, and an upward movement was started. The\r\nVanderbilts and the Grangers were the features of the market.\r\n\r\n_December, 1885._—Texas Pacific stock collapsed. A receiver was\r\nappointed for the property on the suit of the Missouri Pacific, a large\r\nholder of its floating debt.—William H. Vanderbilt died suddenly on the\r\n8th. The fact was not known down town until after business hours, but it\r\nhad a very unsettling influence. The next morning the market opened 1@3\r\npoints lower, but the bulls had combined to support prices, and bought\r\nfreely. In many instances prices were higher at the close than on the\r\nprevious day.\r\n\r\n_February, 1886._—The trans-continental pool was ruptured. The railroads\r\ndeclined to continue to pay the subsidy demanded by Pacific Mail.\r\n\r\n_March, 1886._—Western Union declared a scrip dividend of 1½ per cent.\r\nfor the quarter.

The announcement caused a rapid\r\nadvance in all coal stocks.—The great strike on the Gould system of\r\nrailroads, inaugurated on the 7th, failed.—Heavy engagements of gold for\r\nshipment abroad were made.\r\n\r\n_April, 1886._—Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific were sold in\r\nforeclosure.—Labor strikes at their height. The Lake Shore switchmen\r\nstruck in Chicago, and the Third Avenue horse car drivers in New York.\r\nThe troubles had a depressing influence on the stock market.\r\n\r\n_May, 1886._—Charles Woerishoffer, bear operator, died May 9.—Chicago\r\nanarchists attacked the police with bombs, killing and wounding many.\r\nPolice used revolvers freely and many rioters fell. Anarchists were\r\nsentenced to death.—The strike on the Southwestern system was officially\r\ndeclared off on the 1st. The men were completely beaten after a contest\r\nof six weeks.—Tasker Marvin, bull operator, failed. Marketing of long\r\nstock caused decline.

Low priced non-dividend\r\npayers were largely dealt in. One specialty after another was “boomed,”\r\nand in some instances large profits were made.\r\n\r\n_December, 1886._—About $10,740,000 in gold was imported at New York\r\nduring the month.—Prices toppled over on the 15th. All kinds of cheap\r\nstocks had been boomed by cliques, when, on money becoming tight, there\r\nwas a rush to realize. Sales reached the unprecedented figure of\r\n1,095,159 shares. The most conspicuous stocks in the decline were\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading and New York & New England. No financial disaster\r\nor failure of importance occurred. There was much uneasiness for several\r\ndays, but a better feeling soon set in, although speculation was checked\r\nby the prevailing high rate for money.—The Inter-State Commerce bill was\r\nintroduced in Congress.\r\n\r\n_January, 1887._—On a report that Hocking Valley had suffered by\r\nirregularities of former directors, stock broke 1½ points. The\r\nconsumption of iron in the United States exceeded that of Great Britain\r\nfor the first time in 1886. The Inter-State Commerce Bill was passed by\r\nthe House Jan. 21, by a vote of 5 to 1. European war rumors caused\r\nforeign selling and a break in the market of 2 to 5 points. There was a\r\ncomplete recovery on the following day.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n     INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BARTHOLDI\r\n                             STATUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT AS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF ART, BUT GREATER AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE\r\n    IDEA OF UNIVERSAL FREEDOM THE WORLD OVER.—IT IS A POETIC IDEA OF A\r\n    UNIVERSAL REPUBLIC.—ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE WORLD MUST RESULT IN THE\r\n    FREEDOM OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following was sent by me to the New York _World_, as briefly\r\nembodying my views on Bartholdi’s great work, a few days prior to the\r\ndedication of the Statue of Liberty:\r\n\r\n“When, several years ago, the gigantic forearm, with the torch in its\r\nhand, of the Statue of Liberty was exhibited in Madison square, the\r\npeople who gazed at it with idle curiosity had little idea that the\r\nmammoth structure of which it was a part would so soon be completed, or\r\nthat it would be so great an achievement as it now stands. Thanks to the\r\nNew York _World_, which gave the impetus to the subscription fund\r\nmovement, which enabled the great sculptor to realize the greatest\r\nartistic dream of his life within a reasonable period. Some people may\r\nimagine that the time has been long, but many people who understood the\r\nmagnitude of the work, and observed the slowness of the subscriptions,\r\nhad no hope of seeing it finished in this generation prior to the time\r\nthe subscription for the pedestal was under way.\r\n\r\n“Until the last few days, when this colossal goddess arose on Bedloe’s\r\nIsland in all her full, finished and magnificent proportions and\r\nartistic splendor, like the ancient divinity emerging from the foam of\r\nthe sea, the people did not begin to realize the magnitude of\r\nBartholdi’s idea. In mere mechanical size the statue with its\r\nappurtenances excel anything and everything of the same character in the\r\nworld. It is the biggest thing of its kind either ancient or modern, and\r\nis, therefore, the most appropriate emblem to show forth the evolution\r\nand the international and historic associations of the two greatest\r\nRepublics that the world has yet seen. The Colossus of Rhodes, the great\r\nSphinx and other colossal statues sink into insignificance when compared\r\nwith the latest production of Bartholdi’s brain.\r\n\r\n“But great as the statue is as a work of art, the international idea\r\nwhich it embodies is greater still. When taken in connection with that\r\nearlier and comparatively insignificant effort of the same eminent\r\nartist, the Statue of Lafayette in Union square, the Colossus of Liberty\r\nsuggests a whole century of history, replete with greater events than\r\nthe thousand years which preceded it. In these two statues the\r\ninterdependence of the two great nations is clearly portrayed, and their\r\ndestiny as the pioneers of universal Republicanism brought out in bold\r\nrelief. If Tennyson’s poetic dream of a universal Republic is ever to be\r\nrealized it will come through the idea which the chisel of Bartholdi has\r\nimmortalized, and which the _World_ has been chiefly instrumental in\r\nproviding with a local habitation and a name on Bedloe’s Island.\r\nEuropean monarchs are now trembling on their thrones, which are doomed\r\nto crumble into ruins at no distant day, through the very idea which\r\n‘The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World’ is destined to propagate\r\nfrom this day forward in its imposing position in our spacious harbor.\r\nThe Israelites of old were cured of their bodily maladies by gazing at a\r\nserpent erected on a pole. In a similar way the politically afflicted\r\nand oppressed of all nations, as soon as they emerge through the narrows\r\nof our magnificent bay, either by day or night, will find a panacea for\r\nall their ills in the sight of that wonderful statue, with all that its\r\nname implies.\r\n\r\n“And one word as to what is in that name which has been so severely\r\ncriticised. On account of it Americans have been charged with egotism,\r\nbut those who talk in this way seem to forget that Bartholdi himself, as\r\nthe representative of the French nation, is the author of the name. So,\r\nas it comes from him in his representative capacity, we can receive it\r\nwith good grace, and without being amenable to any such charge as that\r\nreferred to. Taken, with all its broad, historical associations, I don’t\r\nthink the name is at all too pretentious. I have no hesitation in\r\npredicting that, ere the present century draws to a close, results will\r\nfully justify the assumption.\r\n\r\n“The magnificent gift of the French people, and the years of toil and\r\nstudy which Bartholdi has devoted, gratis, to his unprecedented labor of\r\nlove, cannot fail of the great and only reward which both have so\r\nearnestly and magnanimously sought, namely—to enlighten the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n     LARGE FORTUNES AND THEIR DISPOSITION.\r\n\r\nHOW THE FORTUNES OF THE ASTORS WERE MADE.—GEORGE PEABODY AND HIS\r\n    PHILANTHROPIC SCHEMES.—JOHNS HOPKINS AND HIS PECULIARITIES.—A.

TILDEN’S\r\n    MUNIFICENT BEQUESTS.—THE VANDERBILT CLINIC.—LICK, CORCORAN, STEVENS\r\n    AND CATHARINE WOLF.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall take a short review in this chapter of some of the most\r\nprominent wealthy men who have been the architects of their own\r\nfortunes, and comment briefly on their methods of disposing of their\r\nestates.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, John Jacob Astor was one of the first to arrest\r\npublic attention in the matter of large fortunes. Before his day there\r\nwere few, if any, millionaires on this side of the Atlantic. Now there\r\nare thousands of these lucky individuals. It is true, George Washington,\r\nthe Father of our country, was very comfortably fixed, and supported\r\naristocratic style in his domestic life, but he probably never was worth\r\nmore, all told, than $200,000. It is singular that none of his\r\nsuccessors have ever been worth even this amount. It was believed at one\r\ntime that Grant had accumulated a large amount of money and value, and\r\nwas fast approaching the financial status of a millionaire, but this\r\npopular delusion was suddenly dispelled when he and his family were\r\nvictimized by the first young Napoleon of finance, Ferdinand Ward.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the now wealthy house of Astor and of the Astor Library\r\ndied in 1848, at the age of 85. He left the greater bulk of his estate\r\nto his son, William B. Astor. He bequeathed $400,000 to the Astor\r\nLibrary, also a few legacies, amounting in all, the library inclusive,\r\nto about $500,000. His wealth, at the time of his death, was estimated\r\nat twenty millions, a very large fortune at that time.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Astor, who died in 1875, left $250,000 to the library, and\r\nthe large balance of his estate to his sons and widow.\r\n\r\nThe Astors have been characteristic for their benefactions, in a quiet\r\nway, to a large number of public objects. Their estate is remarkable for\r\nthe way it has been kept intact, and for its steady and considerably\r\nrapid improvement, and they are popular as landlords.\r\n\r\nThe elder Astor who came to this country from Waldorf in Germany, near\r\nHeidelberg, before he was 20 years of age, and who started in life\r\ndealing in furs, had a grand scheme on foot at one time for monopolizing\r\nthe fur trade of the whole world, which he had calculated would then\r\nhave brought him a million dollars a year. He was diverted from this\r\npurpose by the large profits which he found in real estate, by dealing\r\nin which he made most of his money; and the family has steadily adhered\r\nto this line of speculation and investment through two generations.\r\n\r\nThe native American who, perhaps, ranks above all others in the\r\nmunificence of his gifts, and the beneficence of his purpose was George\r\nPeabody. He was a poor Massachusetts boy, who, by hard industry, arose\r\nto be one of the largest millionaires of his day. He was also a\r\nphilanthropist in the highest sense of the term. His fortune at one time\r\nprobably exceeded ten millions. His well-known benefactions, during his\r\nlife, exceeded seven million dollars, and it is supposed that he gave\r\naway vast amounts in charity of which no definite account was kept.\r\n\r\nShortly before his death, in 1869, he bequeathed two and a half millions\r\nas a building fund for lodging houses for the poor of London, and\r\ndevised for a Southern Education Fund two million one hundred thousand.\r\nIn addition to these he left five millions to various relatives. J. S.\r\nMorgan, who was Mr. Peabody’s partner in the banking business, became,\r\nat his death, his successor, and is now supposed to be a richer man than\r\nMr. Peabody ever was.\r\n\r\nJohns Hopkins, who died at Baltimore in 1873, at the age of 78, was one\r\nof the most eccentric millionaires and philanthropists. Very few\r\nexpected that he would bequeath the great university and the hospital\r\nwhich are called by his name. He was so wretchedly penurious that he\r\nhardly afforded himself the means of subsistence. His benefactions to\r\nthese two institutions, however, exceed eight million dollars.\r\n\r\nAlexander T. Stewart, the great dry goods merchant, who was reputed to\r\nbe one of the three wealthiest men in the United States, Commodore\r\nVanderbilt and John Jacob Astor being the other two, died in 1876. He\r\nhad no legitimate heirs, and his estate, estimated at one time between\r\ntwenty and thirty millions, was left to his wife, with the exception of\r\na million to Judge Hilton and $325,000 to his employes.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart’s two great benefactions were failures, as he left nobody\r\nable and willing to carry out his intentions in regard to their\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThey would probably have been failures in any event, as they seemed to\r\nthe majority of people to be in a large measure Utopian. One was Garden\r\nCity on Long Island, intended to be homes for industrious mechanics on a\r\nhigher and more comfortable scale than the majority of the dwelling of\r\nthese sons of physical and intellectual toil. A grand cathedral was\r\nbuilt there in memory of the merchant prince, and a beautiful crypt for\r\nhis mortal remains, which were stolen from St. Mark’s churchyard shortly\r\nafter the interment.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics and laborers were not attracted to Garden City, and it is\r\nnow making slow progress with tenants whose avocations are generally in\r\nthe higher walks of life.\r\n\r\nThe other great enterprise was a home for girls and women at moderate\r\nexpense. This was in the shape of a hotel on a large scale at Park\r\nAvenue and Thirty-third street. The restrictions and the prices were\r\nsuch that the home also failed to attract the class it was intended for.\r\nThe public gift, therefore, reverted to the Stewart estate, or rather\r\nwas taken forcible possession of by the trustees and transformed into\r\nthe Park Avenue Hotel. To carry out the rather indefinite terms of the\r\nbequest would probably have involved the expenditure of a very large\r\namount of the Stewart estate, and, perhaps, the enterprise would even\r\nthen have been a failure. It is more than probable that if Mr. Stewart\r\nhad lived a few years longer, he himself would have been satisfied with\r\nthe impracticability of both his semi-philanthropic schemes.\r\n\r\nThere were great things expected in the shape of benefactions from Mr.\r\nStewart at the time of his death. He had done so little in that respect\r\nwhile living that the public indulged the hope that he would make up for\r\nhis charitable shortcomings when he found that his worldly accumulations\r\ncould no longer be of any service or gratification to him, and that he\r\ncould not take any of them away with him.\r\n\r\nHence, it was a considerable disappointment to the public when the will\r\nrevealed the fact that nothing had been devised, out of the immense\r\nhoard of nearly half a century’s savings, to charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his death I had an engagement with my dentist, Mr.\r\nDwinell, in Thirty-fourth street, and while I was seated in the chair\r\nMr. Wilson MacDonald, the well known sculptor, came in to pay a visit to\r\nthe dentist, with whom he was well acquainted. Having been introduced by\r\nthe sculptor, we immediately entered into conversation on the prominent\r\nlocal topic of the day, the death of Mr. Stewart and the probable\r\ndistribution of his wealth.\r\n\r\nMr. MacDonald invited me to go to his studio to see a bust in clay of\r\nMr. Stewart that he had just about finished. He said, “I knew Mr.\r\nStewart’s aversion to having any portraits or photographs taken of\r\nhimself during his lifetime, so I provided for the emergency some time\r\nago by taking close observation of him at various intervals. During the\r\npast two years I have frequently come in contact with him, going into\r\nhis store and getting a good look at him from various points of view, so\r\nas to impress his likeness upon my mind. I have thus succeeded in\r\ngetting a pretty good bust of him in clay.”\r\n\r\nMr. MacDonald was very anxious that I should call and see this bust,\r\nbecause, as I knew Mr. Stewart so well, he inferred that my judgment\r\nwould be worth something, and he expressed a desire that I should\r\ncriticise his work. I promised him I would call and see the bust as soon\r\nas I could spare the time.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the dentist’s office I made another engagement to go back the\r\nfollowing week, and in the meantime I had been unable to call at the\r\nstudio of the artist, but the latter happened to be in the office of the\r\ndentist when I called there again. The will of Mr. Stewart had been\r\npublished in the interim, and in it all reference to charities and\r\nbenevolent institutions had been carefully omitted.\r\n\r\nMr. MacDonald reminded me that I had not called to see the bust, and\r\nadded, “If you had called that time you would hardly recognize any\r\nresemblance between what it is now and what it was then.” “How is that?”\r\nI inquired. “Because,” he replied (facetiously), “as soon as I saw the\r\nwill published in the newspapers and none of that immense pile left to\r\nthe public, from whom it had been collected, I set to work and toned\r\ndown the bumps of benevolence, conscientiousness, sublimity, veneration\r\nand ideality, making those of acquisitiveness, inhabitiveness,\r\namativeness and all the selfish and animal propensities prominent. I\r\nnaturally concluded, if phrenology is not a fraud, that Stewart’s will\r\nwas a manifestation of the non-existence of the higher and more humane\r\norgans in his cranium. There certainly could be nothing there indicative\r\nof any generous emotions.”\r\n\r\nI think everybody who knew the great dry goods merchant will be inclined\r\nto say that the judgment of the sculptor was neither rash nor\r\nuncharitable.\r\n\r\n                            STEPHEN GIRARD.\r\n\r\nStephen Girard was another of the great millionaires who arose from\r\npenury, and whose eccentricity took a philanthropic turn. Mr. Girard was\r\na Frenchman, born near Bordeaux in 1750, who made his home in later\r\nyears in Philadelphia. He bequeathed over two million dollars to found\r\nand endow Girard College in that city.\r\n\r\nThere is a good story told, which seems to be well authenticated, of the\r\nmanner in which Mr. Girard rewarded the ingratitude of a sister. When he\r\nwas a boy about ten he manifested very little disposition for hard work,\r\nand his family treated him harshly. One morning a rumpus arose about his\r\nidleness, and having said something that aroused the ire of his sister,\r\nshe clutched the broom and flew at him in a rage. He retreated,\r\nreceiving a few hard blows over the shoulders as he passed for the last\r\ntime over the threshold of his paternal home. He went to sea, his father\r\nhaving been a seaman, and through various vicissitudes of fortune\r\neventually turned up as a millionaire in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAfter young Girard had gone through the preliminary course as cabin boy,\r\ntrading between France, the West Indies and New York, he had saved up\r\nsome money and became part owner of a small trading vessel. This was in\r\n1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence. His trading was\r\nsuspended by the war with Great Britain. He then speculated in the\r\nrenting of a number of stores in Philadelphia, and sub-let them at a\r\nlarge profit. Afterward he purchased a controlling interest in the stock\r\nof the old U. S. Bank in 1812, and became a private banker with a\r\ncapital of more than a million. Subsequently he loaned five millions to\r\nthe Government to help defray war expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime fortune, however, had not favored his irate sister, who\r\nhad chastised him with the broom. She remained poor. She had heard of\r\nher brother’s wealth, however, but did not have money enough to pay her\r\npassage to this country. In this extremity she went to the captain of a\r\nPhiladelphia vessel in a French port and told him that she was a sister\r\nof Stephen Girard, without money, and desired to go and see her brother,\r\nwho was well known to the captain. She received the best accommodation\r\nthat the vessel could afford. Having arrived in Philadelphia the gallant\r\ncaptain escorted her to the house of her wealthy brother. Leaving her in\r\nthe hallway he went in to see Mr. Girard and told him that a lady\r\noutside wished to see him. The benevolent captain was prepared to behold\r\na demonstration of joy, which he thought would be exhibited as soon as\r\nthe long lost brother and sister should recognize each other. He was not\r\nkept long in suspense. Mr. Girard knew his sister instantly. “_C’est\r\nvous._” “It is you,” he said. “Oui,” she replied. These were all the\r\nwords that passed. There was no rushing into each others arms, but on\r\nthe contrary, Mr. Girard plunged at the captain in a lively mood. “What\r\nauthority had you to bring that woman here?” he said. The captain was\r\ndumbfounded and hardly knew what to answer. “Take her back again at your\r\nown expense,” he added.\r\n\r\nThe captain did not stand a minute on the order of his going, and the\r\nmillionaire’s sister, without receiving one kind adieu, was conducted\r\nfrom the palatial mansion of her brother to the vessel, and thence to\r\nher pauper home in France.\r\n\r\nThis shows that the great philanthropist had a good memory and was\r\nresentful of injuries, yet it also betrays a narrowness from some taint\r\nof which the greatest minds are not entirely free. The Girard sister was\r\nunable to comprehend the higher aspirations of her young brother and his\r\nintelligent convictions, which had, no doubt, taken form at that early\r\nperiod of his life, that a man can never become wealthy by hard manual\r\nlabor. He was wrong, however, in giving her the cold shoulder. She was\r\ncorrect in one sense, from her point of view, although a narrow view,\r\nand his large charity should have condoned an error arising from her\r\nsuperficial conception of his early designs.\r\n\r\nHis narrow-mindedness, with all his genuine greatness, and his\r\neccentricity were exhibited in a remarkable degree in some of the\r\nrestrictions of his will regarding the college. Although he was\r\nexceedingly generous in his gifts to religious denominations, without\r\ndistinction, as well as to charitable institutions generally, he was,\r\nthough illiterate, a free thinker of the school of Voltaire and\r\nRousseau. He, therefore, had inserted in his will a prohibitory clause\r\nto the effect that no clergyman should be permitted to have anything to\r\ndo with Girard College, nor even be admitted as a visitor. The college\r\nis for orphans between six and ten years of age, who are put to a trade\r\nwhen they are sixteen, all expenses being defrayed until they are able\r\nto earn a living. There are now over 500 beneficiaries. Girard died in\r\n1831, at the ripe age of four score and one. He was worth nine million\r\ndollars, of which but a very small pittance went to a few of his\r\nrelatives, the great bulk of the estate having been distributed among\r\ncharitable institutions. This great philanthropist was exceedingly close\r\nin money matters with men generally, and it is said that he never had a\r\nfriend, except the friend in the pocket, which is by all odds the most\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\nThe late James Lenox takes rank with the great philanthropists of the\r\nage, in attempting to devote a large portion of his surplus wealth to\r\nthe good of humanity. When he died, in 1880, at the age of eighty, he\r\nwas supposed to be one of the five wealthiest men in New York. He spent\r\na million dollars to found and endow the Presbyterian Hospital at\r\nSeventieth street and Madison avenue, and over a half million in\r\nbuilding the Lenox Library at Seventieth street and Fifth avenue.\r\n\r\nThe building and the library are both immense gifts, but admission to\r\nthe latter is so hampered by red tape, forms and ceremonies that it is\r\nof little or no earthly use to the general public. As a piece of\r\narchitecture the building may, according to the ideas of the famous John\r\nBuskin, help to educate the people, but in other respects they derive no\r\nbenefit from it. The library, which is built on ten city lots, contains\r\nthe choicest selection of books in the world, outside of the British\r\nMuseum, besides valuable manuscripts and works of art, and its\r\ncollection of American works is unsurpassed anywhere. That part of the\r\ncollection, consisting of Mr. Lenox’s own private library of 15,000\r\nvolumes, contains books of rare value, many of which could not be\r\nduplicated. This is one reason why the general public are excluded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is a good deal to be said in favor of the fastidious care\r\nthat is taken of some libraries and picture galleries, as a large\r\nportion of the general public don’t know how to appreciate their\r\nprivileges, and therefore abuse them, some through the relic monomania\r\nand others actuated by pure mischief. Thus it was that Mr. William H.\r\nVanderbilt was very reluctantly obliged to exclude the general public\r\nfrom his fine picture gallery, as certain visitors scratched the\r\netchings with their canes and put their fingers on the pictures, while\r\nothers were incessantly on the relic hunt and had to be carefully\r\nwatched during their visit.\r\n\r\n                             PETER COOPER.\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper was another of the philanthropists, with large means, who\r\nsought to distribute a considerable part of it where it would do the\r\nmost good to humanity, especially to that portion of it who are in\r\npursuit of knowledge under difficulties. Mr. Cooper had a hard time of\r\nit himself getting a fair education, and he knew how to appreciate the\r\nboon. He was born in New York in 1791, and at the age of seventeen was\r\napprenticed to a coachmaker. He tried his hand at several other\r\noccupations, was an inventor by nature, and the designer and builder of\r\nthe first locomotive in this country, which had its trial trip on a part\r\nof the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper experienced his great success in fortune building in the\r\nmanufacture of glue. He afterwards erected extensive iron works at\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, and subsequently in Trenton, New Jersey. During his\r\nlife he built the Cooper Institute, at a cost of $650,000, with a\r\nsubsequent donation of $150,000. This institution is devoted to the\r\ninstruction and elevation of the working classes. It consists of a large\r\nreading room and library and a public lecture hall. The building\r\noccupies a small block at the junction of Third and Fourth avenues and\r\nEighth street. It has evening schools, attended by 2,000 pupils; a\r\nschool of design for females, in which there are 200; also, a school of\r\ntelegraphy for women, from which, in two years, over 300 operators have\r\nbeen sent out.\r\n\r\nThe rents from the building on the lower floor and the offices defray\r\nthe greater portion of the expenses. Ample provision was made in Mr.\r\nCooper’s will for the permanence of the institution. During his life he\r\nwas a general donor to all kinds of charitable institutions, and almost\r\nevery variety of labor organization. He ran for President in 1876 on the\r\nGreenback and Labor ticket, and was defeated by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. He had an idea that a large issue of greenbacks would create\r\nuniversal prosperity and make everybody happy. He died in 1883, at the\r\nage of ninety-two, leaving five or six million dollars, the greater\r\nportion of which fell to his son and daughter, the latter being the wife\r\nof Mayor Hewitt.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of American philanthropists, especially as his\r\nprincely bequest was rather unexpected, was the Hon. Samuel Jones\r\nTilden, whose financial and political career I have referred to in\r\nanother chapter. He was about seventy-three years of age at the time of\r\nhis death, in August, 1886.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden died worth about five millions, four of which he left to be\r\ndonated to public and beneficent objects. The greater part of this is to\r\nbe spent in the erection and endowment of a grand free library, which,\r\nif the terms of the bequest are properly administered, will be the\r\ngreatest institution of its kind in this country.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the Vanderbilt fortune, up to the present time, has\r\nbeen briefly described in the lives of the various members of the family\r\nin another chapter. The Clinic of the College of Physicians, however,\r\nwhich has recently been opened at Sixtieth street and Fourth avenue, is\r\nentitled to greater detail, as it is, perhaps, destined at some future\r\nday to become a great medical centre. Mrs. W. D. Sloane, daughter of Wm.\r\nH. Vanderbilt, subscribed $250,000 to build the Maternity Hospital, in\r\nconnection with this institution, her father having, prior to that,\r\ndonated the balance of the million necessary to finish the entire\r\nstructure, which consists of the Clinic, the Maternity Hospital and the\r\nCollege Hospital. It is said that in all their appointments the\r\ndifferent departments of this institution are superior to anything of a\r\nsimilar description in the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who disposed of great fortunes I may mention James Lick,\r\nof California, who devoted millions to charitable purposes; William W.\r\nCorcoran of Washington, who gave two millions for an art gallery and a\r\nhome for old, decrepit and superannuated women; also, Mr. Stevens, of\r\nHoboken, who devised two millions, one for the Stevens Battery and the\r\nother for the Stevens Institute at Hoboken. Miss Catharine Wolf, who\r\ndied last year worth twelve millions, bequeathed largely of her estate\r\nto charitable purposes, and donated her magnificent art gallery to the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art.\r\n\r\nWhat a lesson is taught in these examples of philanthropic celebrities\r\nto our fellow-beings—I was going to say fellow citizens, but that would\r\nnot be appropriate in many instances—the Socialists. Those millionaires,\r\nwho have all more or less been denounced as hard-hearted monopolists,\r\nhave been among the hardest workers and thinkers all their lives, many\r\nof them denying themselves the luxuries and some of them even the full\r\nnecessities of life. For what purpose? Simply to be the hard worked and\r\npoorly fed mediums of accumulating wealth to relieve the necessities and\r\nminister to the comfort of the less fortunate, the idle, the dissipated,\r\nthe poor and the needy, and in general those who misunderstood and\r\nabused them on account of their good work.\r\n\r\nIt was good for those benefactors of humanity that virtue is its own\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n       SOUTHERN AFFAIRS IN SPECULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION A GREAT BLESSING.—TO LET THEM “SECESH”\r\n    WOULD HAVE BEEN NATIONAL SUICIDE.—HOW IMMIGRATION HAS ASSISTED\r\n    NATIONAL PROSPERITY.—RESCUED FROM THE DYNASTIC OPPRESSION OF\r\n    EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS.—SHOWING GOOD FELLOWSHIP TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN\r\n    PEOPLE AND AIDING THEM IN THEIR INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.—THE SOUTH,\r\n    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR, HAD GREATER ADVANTAGES THAN THE NORTH FOR\r\n    MAKING MATERIAL PROGRESS.—THE BUSINESS OF THE NORTH WAS\r\n    INFLATED.—THE STATES OF GEORGIA AND ALABAMA OFFERED INVITING FIELDS\r\n    FOR INVESTMENT.—ISSUING STATE SECURITIES, CHEATING AND\r\n    REPUDIATING.—PRESIDENT JOHNSON CHIEFLY TO BLAME FOR THE BREACH OF\r\n    FAITH WITH INVESTORS WHO WERE SWINDLED OUT OF THEIR MONEY.—REVENGE\r\n    AND AVARICE UNITE IN FINANCIAL REPUDIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the war I did all that lay in my humble power to farther the\r\ncause of the Union, believing that it was a righteous one, and that the\r\nNorth went into the struggle to maintain, uphold and preserve the best\r\nform of government known to man, and certainly the only one suitable to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nView it as we may, the wisdom of man has yet evolved nothing to surpass\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. Whether Thomas Jefferson or\r\nThomas Paine was the author of its leading features, is a matter that I\r\nshall not stop to discuss, but suffice it to say, that upon it has been\r\nestablished the best government in the world. There is no other system\r\nin ancient or modern history that could weld together and bring into the\r\nsocial and political affinity of one great integral harmony the immense\r\nvariety and diversity of human elements that are dwelling as one large\r\nand comparatively happy family in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat other system could combine so many nationalities, creeds, passions\r\nand prejudices, modifying all of them and uniting all for the general\r\ngood and the perfection of a higher development of human nature in\r\npolitical and social life?\r\n\r\nThere is none. We must go to the pleasanter pages of political fiction\r\nto find a comparison.\r\n\r\nThis country has made greater strides in each decade towards the\r\npossible approach of More’s Utopia or Plato’s Republic than any other\r\ncountry has done in the same number of centuries.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that we are a considerable distance from the happy\r\ngoal contemplated by the writers named, but we are moving in the\r\ndirection to show that its attainment is possible. We shall yet\r\naccomplish what the world has hitherto considered a pleasant fiction\r\noverworked through the highest ideal of Greek art.\r\n\r\nThis high state of development is what we are coming to in spite of the\r\nfact that the average ward politician has immense chasms to cross before\r\nthe hill tops of his evolution shall appear in sight. When he begins to\r\nclimb, however, his ascent will be marvellously rapid and he will leave\r\nthat vehement youth of Longfellow’s, whose watchword was Excelsior, far\r\nin the distance. Moreover, his steps will be steady and prudent, and not\r\nliable to unfortunate reaction or fatal mishap.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that revolutions never go backward. With much stronger\r\nemphasis it may be asserted that evolutions in a Republic like those I\r\nam now contemplating never recede, but still press forward and upward\r\ntowards the mark of a higher ideal.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the people who come here do so for the chief\r\npurpose of getting away from other forms of government that are despotic\r\nin their rule and oppressive to their subjects.\r\n\r\nThese people who come to us are saved and redeemed Their lives would\r\nhave been wasted if they had remained in the land of their birth. In\r\nthis country, they not only add to the wealth of the nation, but they\r\nbecome useful members of the social fabric, with few exceptions,\r\nenjoying happiness themselves and bringing up children, whom they teach\r\nto admire, honor and revere the institutions of this country in contrast\r\nwith the land of their own nativity.\r\n\r\nThis country has thus become the asylum for the down-trodden of every\r\nnation, and it is a great gainer by the contrast thus constantly\r\npresented to the minds of those who come here. Our own people are also\r\nin this way taught to appreciate their privileges and set a higher value\r\nupon the advantages they enjoy.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the constant stream of immigration to these shores,\r\nthe people of this country might begin to think that Republicanism was\r\nthe birthright of all, and forget that they enjoyed especial privileges\r\nby birth, and came into this world with a very important start of other\r\nnations. I fear that some of them are prone to imagine, especially some\r\nof the fair sex, that we suffer here from that long felt want of a\r\nhereditary and native nobility. Some of these fair ones have had sad\r\nexperience, that should have disabused their young minds of these\r\nnotions not very long ago. The force of these examples will have some\r\neffect, at least, in moderating the folly of their mothers. It can\r\nhardly be expected that many of the young ladies will learn much\r\nthemselves, except by a repetition of the same sad experience, but the\r\npersuasive powers of the mammas may exercise a deterring effect in many\r\ninstances where hasty matrimonial alliances to catch the bauble of a\r\nforeign title would be the forerunner of much misery and sometimes\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nI might cite many instances of these from our own city, but the\r\nsensational papers will deal with them _ad nauseam_. I don’t aspire to\r\nbe sensational in this book. I only attempt to state in matters of this\r\nkind what may suffice to point the moral, leaving the sensational\r\nstory-teller to adorn the tale Nor do I mean to cast any reflection on\r\nsuch happy marriages as that of Miss Jerome to Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\nand others I could mention.\r\n\r\nOur expansive territory has enabled the adventurous and energetic of all\r\nnations of the world to come here and make homes for themselves, instead\r\nof remaining in the land of their birth, where many of them were\r\nexisting in a modified condition of slavery under other names.\r\n\r\nThe idea of encouraging this large exodus from other lands, and this\r\nfreedom of assimilation with our people, has been one of the great\r\nbulwarks of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nI realized this fact very clearly at the commencement of the war of the\r\nRebellion, and have cherished it ever since.\r\n\r\nI therefore felt deeply earnest in my sympathy with the North against\r\nthe South, whose great effort was to break up the present form of\r\ngovernment, attempting to destroy its autonomy and powerful\r\ncohesiveness.\r\n\r\nThe nation would have been split in twain to start with, if Horace\r\nGreeley’s advice had been taken, “Let them secesh.” Mr. Greeley’s\r\ncounsel was well meant, as he thought the Southern people would soon be\r\nglad to return to the Union, but it would have been national suicide to\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\nThe two parts of the dissevered nation would have been constantly\r\nmenacing each other, and kept on a war footing, with occasionally\r\nrecurring hostilities across the border on every slight provocation. The\r\nresult would have been that some or all of the European powers would\r\nhave taken advantage of this state of affairs to plant the standard of\r\ndespotism once more on these shores, making this fair land a battle\r\nground for Imperial and kingly ambition.\r\n\r\nThese designs were foreshadowed by Napoleon III., whose actions I have\r\ndealt with more fully in another place, and Great Britain was only\r\nawaiting the opportunity to avenge Bunker Hill, Saratoga and Yorktown.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the powers of Europe would have taken advantage of the\r\nchance of acquiring a slice of such a fine domain, where in the event of\r\nsuccessful secession only feeble resistance could have been offered to\r\nforeign aggression.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a decisive victory for the Confederate arms, faction\r\nfights would have always been springing up, and the tendency would still\r\nhave been increasing to create a greater number of separate and\r\nindependent governments.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had been looking at matters in this probable light, when he\r\nresolved to make Mexico a backdoor, with Maximilian as its keeper, to\r\nenable him to gain an entrance to this country when a favorable\r\nopportunity for the completion of his purposes should arise.\r\n\r\nHaving myself been born in a foreign land, where I passed my boyhood’s\r\ndays, I have a vivid recollection of the workings of the harsh system of\r\na European government, although by the accident of birth I was placed in\r\ncircumstances where the pressure on myself was not very galling.\r\n\r\nI saw enough, however, to make a durable impression on my mind, to\r\narouse my sympathies for others and to excite my lasting indignation\r\nagainst dynastic oppression.\r\n\r\nI lost no opportunity during the dark days of the rebellion in this\r\ncountry, to be outspoken in favor of the cause which I had espoused from\r\na firm conviction that it was right. I did all I could to help to\r\npromote ways and means for aiding the North in carrying on the war. I\r\nwent into the contest with my whole heart, and gave my entire and\r\nundivided attention to the sale of Government securities to raise the\r\nsinews of war.\r\n\r\nIn this way, I believe, I rendered more valuable assistance to the cause\r\nthan if I had been performing deeds of valor amid the roar of cannon and\r\nthe rattle of musketry.\r\n\r\nI became pronounced in my opinions and made myself active in organizing\r\nmeetings to celebrate every victory of the Union army, thus inspiring\r\nthe men in the field and the recruits on their way thither, and\r\nsustaining the hearts of our business men to place implicit confidence\r\nin the future triumph of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt required more courage than many people now imagine to take this stand\r\nat that time, for opinion was largely divided in this city on the\r\nprospects of the issue, and a strong sentiment in favor of the enemy\r\nthreatened at one time to become predominant.\r\n\r\nMany people were eyed with very strong suspicion during the greater part\r\nof the struggle in regard to their loyalty, who had followed the course\r\nof extreme prudence in keeping their counsel, being doubtful of the\r\nresult. I took the ground that citizenship would not be worth much in\r\nthe event of final disaster to the Union cause. I was also of the\r\nopinion, when the war was ended to the glory of the country and the\r\nmaintenance of the Government on a substantial basis, that the time had\r\ncome to bury the hatchet.\r\n\r\nI believed not only in bringing back the South under the old flag, but\r\nalso in extending the right hand of fellowship to the people, who,\r\nwhatever may have been their faults, had been terribly punished.\r\n\r\nI believed that no good could come out of a policy that persisted in\r\ntrampling upon a fallen foe, especially as that foe had, after all, only\r\nbeen an erring brother, and could be brought back again into the family\r\nfold to share its mutual sympathy and material prosperity.\r\n\r\nI felt, therefore, that I could afford to be prominent in a movement\r\nthat had this great and harmonious end in view, the more especially as\r\nmy loyalty had never been questioned in the hour of our greatest peril.\r\n\r\nI not only extended the right hand of fellowship to Southern men, but\r\ngave aid and comfort to them wherever they appeared in our midst.\r\n\r\nMy office, therefore, after having been the headquarters of loyal\r\nNorthern men, and for every project in the interest of the Union cause,\r\nbecame notorious as the rendezvous of Southern generals and Southern\r\npeople generally, almost as soon as the war was over.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard was one of the prominent leaders of the Confederacy\r\nto whom I exercised the liberty of extending hospitalities on his first\r\nvisit here. I relaxed no effort to make his visit agreeable, and show\r\nhim the sights around the city. I recollect escorting him as my guest to\r\nthe Gold Room, which was then quite an institution in Wall Street. At\r\nthis time gold was selling at a premium of about 50.\r\n\r\nOn our entrance to the Room it was at once whispered around that my\r\ndistinguished guest was General Beauregard. The President of the Board\r\nwas at that time outspoken and bitter in his opinions against everything\r\nSouthern, and had not the good sense and common manners to conceal his\r\nanimus on this occasion. Others took a similar attitude, and the feeling\r\nmanifested became as belligerent as if the war had been actually raging.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition of bad blood and bad manners was very distasteful to me.\r\nI was a member of this Exchange, and I thought I knew my rights, and I\r\nwas disposed to maintain them. I regarded the insult to Beauregard as\r\noffered to myself, and was prepared to resent it accordingly. He was my\r\nguest, and I had determined to stand by him at all hazards. I informed\r\nthose who were foremost in manifesting these unworthy feelings of\r\nresentment that I should protect my friend no matter what course they\r\nshould take, as long as he desired to remain in the room. This had some\r\neffect in smoothing down the asperities of the most hostile, and we were\r\npermitted to depart in peace. I escorted General Beauregard afterwards\r\nto the New York Stock Exchange, where he was kindly received, and\r\nwithout a murmur of feeling. I introduced him to many of the members\r\nindividually, who shook hands with him and interchanged civilities in\r\nthe warmest manner, giving him a hearty welcome to our city. Beauregard\r\nwas delighted with this reception at the Stock Exchange, but was greatly\r\nchagrined at the conduct of the people in the Gold Room.\r\n\r\nAfter this, many other Southern notabilities from time to time came to\r\nthe Street, and received at my hands similar treatment. Among others,\r\nGeneral Forrest, of Fort Pillow carnage notoriety, paid me a visit.\r\n\r\nI could relate a great many other instances, if time and space would\r\npermit, showing very explicitly the efforts I have made to help along\r\nharmony and reconstruction. I was anxious, in the interest of general\r\nprosperity, to assist the South to recover from the dreadful blow\r\ninflicted upon her by a fratricidal war as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSo, as the work of reconstruction progressed, I became interested in the\r\ninternal improvements of that section of our country, as my subsequent\r\ninvestments there will fully attest. I thought that the South had\r\nexperienced fighting enough, as the North had, and that the people of\r\nthat section would gratefully accept the terms in the main agreed upon\r\nunder the appletree at Appomattox, between General Grant and General\r\nLee. I had hoped that the peace would be such as to conserve all the\r\ninterests of the country, including every man, from the boldest and\r\nbravest Confederate general down to the lowest of the negro race,\r\nwithout any invidious distinction. I had the hopeful impression that all\r\nwould go to work and do all in their power to till the soil, or do\r\nanything else that would add to the material wealth of the country and\r\nthe individual happiness of its recreated citizens; that they would\r\napply themselves to every form of industry that would help in any degree\r\nto a recovery from the disasters growing out of the war, and the\r\nlamentable destruction of property attending it.\r\n\r\nThe South immediately after the war had greater advantages than most\r\npeople imagine, if it had only taken hold of them in the right spirit.\r\nIt had various sources of prosperity, which under prudent management\r\nwould have enabled it to leave the North far behind in the race for\r\nwealth. Its leading staples, cotton, tobacco, and rice, had all a gold\r\nvalue in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity of going in to produce at hard-pan prices on a gold\r\nbasis invested it with an immense leverage against the North, with its\r\ninflated currency and war prices, growing out of the large issue of\r\npaper money necessary to carry on the war, and consequent\r\nover-speculation as a natural result or sequence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, then, that, while the South had a grand opening for\r\ngrowth in prosperity on a solid basis to begin with, the business of the\r\nNorth was, in comparison, in an inflated position, that must burst\r\nbefore it could get a fair start on a solid foundation. It appeared as\r\nif it would sooner or later suffer a temporary collapse, while the South\r\nhad only to begin and build without fear of any such interruption.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, selected for my investments as the best fields in the\r\nSouth the two States that stood the highest in their financial credit,\r\nin their character for integrity and enterprise, and that then had the\r\nbrightest outlook, namely Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\nThese States took my money freely, issued their State securities, their\r\nCounty securities, sold me their bonds, and got me thoroughly\r\ninterested, and that to a very large extent, and then treated me with\r\nthe basest ingratitude, repudiating their bonds, and cheating me out of\r\nmy money and property in every way conceivable.\r\n\r\nI attribute the cause of this unjust treatment, however, to Andrew\r\nJohnson, who, by accident, through the assassination of President\r\nAbraham Lincoln, became President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was a Tennesseean, loyal during the war to all appearances,\r\nand for all practical purposes of the Union cause, and he would\r\ndoubtless have so remained had it not been for the unfortunate\r\ncircumstance of Abraham Lincoln’s death.\r\n\r\nThis made him Executive of the nation, for which by ability he was amply\r\nfit and qualified, but through bias and temperament, entirely unfit to\r\nfill creditably this eminent position for the best interests of the\r\ncountry at large.\r\n\r\nThe position I took, as above stated, was, that since the war was over,\r\nit was a thing to be forgotten as speedily as possible. The finality was\r\nseriously delayed owing to the hostility that President Johnson did his\r\nbest to excite and prolong amongst the people of the South.\r\n\r\nCongress, it will be remembered, was leniently disposed in the passing\r\nof measures and framing of laws to bring the traitorous States of the\r\nSouth back again into the Union. The members of Congress most cautiously\r\nand delicately worked to patch up old sores that were supposed to exist\r\nbetween the victors and the vanquished, but when their bills went to the\r\nPresident they were unmercifully subjected to a wholesale process of\r\nvetoing, almost indiscriminately. This produced a condition of chronic\r\nhostility between the legislative and executive branches of the\r\nGovernment, and the wider the breach became the stronger and more\r\nvindictive grew the spirit which it naturally aroused in the Southern\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThese people were sadly misled by the President, whom they trusted, and\r\nhis hobbies were humored at the expense of their prosperity.\r\n\r\nJohnson made the people of the South believe that his vetoes would only\r\ndelay legislation until Congress should be forced to find them something\r\nbetter. They, accordingly, reposed faith in him, and were badly\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of animosity excited by this condition of things so worked\r\non the minds of the people, causing the South to wax bitter and\r\nrevengeful, that it appeared to people on this side of Mason and Dixon’s\r\nline that their Southern brethren had become even more implacable than\r\nduring the hottest scenes of the war.\r\n\r\nIt was for the reasons above stated that bonds which had been issued by\r\nthe South for money invested by the North were, in a large measure,\r\nrepudiated. As soon as it was discovered that most of the vested\r\ninterests were owned by Northern people, the spirit of revenge and\r\navarice combined was aroused to the point of repudiation. And, unlike\r\nthe courage of Macbeth, it did not require any stimulant to make that\r\nthe sticking point. Every method that ingenuity could devise to strike a\r\nblow at the North was employed. No opportunity was allowed to slip that\r\nafforded any advantage, either material or moral.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of accepting the situation as General Lee had done, they\r\nwere led astray by every one who had a political axe to grind. They took\r\nan active part in politics instead of looking after the various\r\nindustries of the country and developing its resources. They engaged in\r\npolitical discussions and their attendant broils, to the neglect of\r\nnecessary enterprises that would have brought them material prosperity.\r\n\r\nThus they became poorer and poorer. Many years were lost in these\r\npolitical turmoils, and the people became more and more embarrassed.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances there were many financial victims, but few, if\r\nany, suffered more in that respect than myself.\r\n\r\nI had over two and a half millions of dollars invested in the State of\r\nGeorgia securities, and in other ways, a million more at least in\r\nAlabama and North Carolina together, all of which was perfectly\r\nannihilated, the entire disastrous result growing out of the factious\r\nspirit that was created and fostered by the vile and narrow prejudices\r\nof President Andrew Johnson, of whom I have still more to say in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Most Very Sincerely Robert Garrett_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN AND SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LEADERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED SULLY, HIS ORIGIN AND SUCCESSFUL CAREER.—CALVIN S.

LOGAN, A SUCCESSFUL MAN\r\n    IN RAILROADING AND MINING.—FINANCIAL CHIEFTAINS OF BALTIMORE.—THE\r\n    GARRETTS.—THEIR GREAT SUCCESS AS RAILROAD MANAGERS.—PORTRAIT OF\r\n    ROBERT GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred Sully, who has become so prominent in the financial world within\r\na year, is tall, rather slightly built, nervous, and energetic. His\r\nface, by its long, square contour and thoughtful lines, suggests that of\r\nSenator Wm. M. Evarts; the eyes are keen and penetrating but kindly. At\r\nheart his tastes are those of a genial literary recluse. Circumstances\r\nand unquestioned ability have made him a financial leader. He was born\r\nabout 46 years ago in Ottawa, Canada, where he received a good\r\nacademical education. He tried his fortune in the West. He went to\r\nCincinnati, studied law, and was graduated from one of its best schools,\r\nwhereupon he went to Davenport, Iowa, and formed a co-partnership which\r\nbecame known as the leading law firm of the city. He acquired some\r\nmeans, and in 1872 came to New York, the proper place for men of\r\nability. It is understood that at this time he had some idea of\r\nindulging his tastes for authorship, but Austin Corbin put a veto on\r\nthat. The two had become acquainted in Davenport, where Mr. Corbin was\r\nformerly a banker, and the latter, on meeting Mr. Sully in New York,\r\ntendered him the position of General Manager of the Corbin Banking\r\nCompany, which he had established here. He accepted it. But this post,\r\nresponsible as it was, could not long hold a born financier, and we soon\r\nfind him obtaining control of the Indiana, Bloomington & Western Road.\r\nHe next bought the Ohio Southern, of which he is still President, a\r\ntransaction in which he and his friend nearly doubled their money. Then\r\nhe made a great deal of money in the Central Iowa and other roads in\r\nIllinois. He and Austin Corbin secured control of the Long Island Road,\r\nand he gave much time and labor to the Manhattan Beach Road and\r\nassociated interests at Coney Island. Then he went into the scheme of\r\nrestoring the financial health of that enfeebled giant among railroads,\r\nthe Reading, and was one of the prime movers in the reorganizing and\r\nconsolidation of the Richmond Terminal, the Richmond & Danville, the\r\nEast Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia, and numerous other Southern roads,\r\nwhich now form one vast system, which will probably yet obtain an\r\nentrance into New York.\r\n\r\n                            CALVIN S. BRICE.\r\n\r\nCalvin S. Brice was Vice-President of the East Tennessee, Virginia &\r\nGeorgia Road, and is a Director in the Richmond Terminal and numerous\r\nother Southern roads. He is now connected with the United States Express\r\nCompany, in the management of which he will take an active part. He was\r\nborn in Lima, Ohio, about 48 years ago, and was educated as a lawyer. He\r\nis below the medium height, and rather slightly built, but has broad\r\nshoulders, a fitting pedestal for a good head, with firm square features\r\nand keen bluish gray eyes. He wears a sandy beard, closely trimmed,\r\nwhich tends to heighten the effect of decision of character. He is a\r\nfinancier of ability.\r\n\r\n                          GEN. SAMUEL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Samuel Thomas, who is prominent in the Southern railroad system,\r\nis now about 50 years of age, is a Western man, and before the war was a\r\ncivil engineer in the service of an Ohio railroad. After the war he\r\nagain became a civil engineer, but, drifting after a time to New York,\r\nengaged in railroad enterprises, and ultimately secured a large interest\r\nin Southern railroads. He is now President of the East Tennessee,\r\nVirginia & Georgia, and is largely interested in the Richmond & West\r\nPoint Terminal, the Richmond & Danville, the Memphis & Charleston, and\r\nother Southern roads. He is tall, well-built, energetic, and affable. He\r\nlives in fine style, and is a member of the Union League. He is worth\r\nseveral millions.\r\n\r\nGen. Thomas M. Logan is President of the Virginia Midland Railroad,\r\nVice-President of the Richmond & Danville and Richmond Terminal, and a\r\nDirector in all the roads in this system. He was born in Charleston, S.\r\nC., about 44 years ago. He served with distinction in the Confederate\r\nArmy, and rose to be a Brigadier-General, being one of the youngest in\r\nthe service. He is a graduate of the University of South Carolina, and\r\nformerly practiced law in Richmond, Virginia, where he is also engaged\r\nin extensive manufacturing and mining enterprises. He resides in\r\nRichmond, and is a member of the Westmoreland Club, but often comes to\r\nNew York on railroad business, in which he has amassed a comfortable\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Garrett’s name will always be associated with that great\r\nproperty, the Baltimore & Ohio, which he rescued from the verge of\r\nbankruptcy. He was a man of great force of character, and inherited an\r\naptitude for business. He was a graduate of Lafayette College in\r\nPennsylvania, and engaged in business in Baltimore. He became a Director\r\nof the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and in 1858 was elected its President.\r\nHe was a staunch supporter of the Union in the civil war. Despite a\r\ndisloyal sentiment plainly noticeable in Baltimore and elsewhere in\r\nMaryland, he lent the Government all the assistance in his power in the\r\ntransportation of hundreds of thousands of Federal soldiers. He was\r\nquick to repair burned bridges, and to do anything to facilitate the\r\nmilitary operations of the Federal Government. President Lincoln and\r\nSecretary Stanton thanked him warmly. His salary as President was\r\n$10,000 a year. The Directors repeatedly offered to increase the\r\nremuneration, but he declined to accept it. He often refused offers as\r\nhigh as $50,000 a year to become the President of other roads. He was\r\nautocratic in his administration. His will was law. He found the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad a weak and struggling underline in the\r\nrailroad world, and he left it a giant in the American system of\r\nrailroad transportation.\r\n\r\nRobert Garrett, the son of the preceding, and now the President of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Road, is one of the railroad kings of the United\r\nStates. He became the President of the Baltimore & Ohio in his\r\nthirty-seventh year, after having served as Third Vice-President and\r\nFirst Vice-President under his father’s administration. He is a graduate\r\nof Princeton, a man of genial characteristics, and a favorite in\r\nsociety. He has made a study of railroad administration, but is now\r\nunderstood to seek some relief from the burdens unavoidably incident to\r\nhis position as the head of a great railroad. And he is wise. He is many\r\ntimes a millionaire. Why should he devote his life to unnecessary care\r\nand labor? Rich men in this country are apt to work too hard. They do\r\nnot enjoy life as men of far less wealth do in Europe. Under almost any\r\nadministration the Baltimore & Ohio Road has a great future before it.\r\nThe road was built to draw the Western trade to Baltimore. This trade\r\nhad been diverted from that city by the building of the great canals.\r\nNew York & Philadelphia were receiving the lion’s share of the traffic.\r\nThe first stone on the Baltimore & Ohio Road was laid by Charles\r\nCarroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, in 1828.\r\nThe road was opened to Wheeling in 1853. The firm of Robert Garrett &\r\nSons was established in 1849, and was originally engaged in the\r\nwholesale grocery trade. When the road reached Wheeling its finances\r\nwere at the lowest ebb. The house founded by the grandfather of the\r\npresent head of the road bought largely of its bonds at a very low\r\nfigure, and this marked the first connection of the Garrett family with\r\nthis great property. The house of Garrett & Sons still exists as a\r\nbanking establishment under the management of T. Harrison Garrett. In\r\n1853 Baltimore & Ohio stock could be bought for a song. Since then it\r\nhas sold at as high as $225 a share. The improvement in the property was\r\nvery largely doe to the efforts of John W. and Robert Garrett.\r\n\r\nThe recent embarrassing complications of Mr. Garrett in connection with\r\nthe management of his railroad and telegraph companies, it is hoped,\r\nwill only be temporary, and I expect to see him again, at no distant\r\nday, reinstated at the head of the great corporation over which he and\r\nhis father presided. His present difficulties are matters of current\r\nnewspaper record and comment, and I need not, therefore, enlarge upon\r\nthem here. As shown by the latest report, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad\r\nis virtually in a good, prosperous and solvable condition, and I have no\r\ndoubt that the Drexel-Morgan syndicate which has undertaken to put the\r\nproperty on a still more solid and durable basis with the ten million\r\nloan which it has negotiated, will uprightly do its whole duty, and in\r\ndue time return the trust considerably enhanced in value to Mr. Garrett,\r\nhis heirs and assigns.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Inman, another member of the Southern railroad circle, was born\r\nin Tennessee. He is tall, fine looking and soldierly in appearance. He\r\nis one of the shrewdest of the capitalists who have invested large\r\namounts in Southern enterprises. He came to New York from Atlanta, quite\r\npoor, after the civil war. In the war he was a quartermaster’s clerk,\r\nand his old quartermaster afterwards became one of his brokers on the\r\nCotton Exchange. Young Inman went into the office of an uncle on\r\narriving in New York, and learned the business of a cotton broker. He\r\nwas clear-headed and successful. After he became a partner in the firm\r\nhe added very materially to his wealth by carrying cotton for the\r\npremiums on the options. He is recognized as one of the leaders of the\r\nCotton Exchange. In recent years he has become a financier, has made\r\nlarge loans to railroads in the South, and has invested heavily in\r\nAtlanta real estate, and in iron enterprises in Birmingham, the rising\r\nSouthern market. He was prominent in the reorganization of the Richmond\r\n& Danville railroad system, in which he is largely interested. He is a\r\ndirector in the Richmond Terminal and associate lines, as well as the\r\nLouisville & Nashville and other Southern roads. He invested nearly two\r\nmillions in the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company. He is now about 50 years\r\nof age. He seems to be a man of destiny. He is a man of great force of\r\ncharacter and exceptional business skill. He resides in New York, and is\r\npossessed of a large fortune.\r\n\r\n                 ANCESTRY IN ENGLAND—BRAINS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIn this country no one cares about ancestry. The spectacle of Mark Twain\r\nweeping at the tomb of Adam is a humorous expression of American\r\nopinions on this general subject of ancestry. To save time he paid his\r\ndevoirs to the fountain head without stopping at the Guelphs, the\r\nTudors, the Bourbons, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs, or the\r\nRomanoffs. There is no time, if there was any wish in this great\r\ncountry—shaking to the tread of gigantic business—to inquire, “Who was\r\nhis father?” There is only time for such questions as, “What do you\r\nknow?” “What can you do?” “How have you succeeded?” Integrity and\r\nability stand a man in better stead in America than show of purple veins\r\nof Norman blood. Even in the aristocracy (so to speak) of brains,\r\nancestry in one sense, so far from being an advantage, is apt to be\r\nprecisely the reverse. A son of Henry Clay or Daniel Webster can never\r\nhope to attain the lofty pre-eminence of the sire, and suffer by\r\ncomparison. Great men do not always have great sons. For one Pitt, the\r\nson of a great Chatham, there are hundreds of sons who intellectually\r\ndishonor great fathers. Brains, intelligence, industry, energy, and\r\npluck; these are the talismanic words which stand for success in\r\nAmerica, where no ghost of a dead feudalism hovers over the land,\r\ndarkening it by its blighting presence. In England the first question, a\r\nsilly echo of centuries, is, “Who is his father?” But who are the\r\nnobility? Have they any title as such to the respect of right-thinking\r\npersons? The nobility is running to seed, or rather the once noble tree\r\nis withering and dying; it has borne its fruit and its time has passed\r\naway. In Scriptural language, Why cumbereth it the ground? How many of\r\nthe nobility are now worthless roues, habitual seducers, dried up or\r\nhalf consumed by the fires of passion and debauchery! They are dying as\r\nthe fool dieth, with a drunken leer on their shrunken faces and the\r\nstain of dishonor on their escutcheons. The Commons of England will yet\r\nredeem the nation from the thraldom of a worthless aristocracy. America\r\nis the true field for the human race. It is the hope and the asylum for\r\nthe oppressed and down-trodden of every clime. It is the inspiring\r\nexample of America—peerless among the nations of the earth, the\r\nbrightest star in the political firmament—that is leavening the hard\r\nlump of aristocracy and promoting a democratic spirit throughout the\r\nworld. It is indeed the gem of the ocean to which the world may well\r\noffer homage. Here merit is the sole test. Birth is nothing. The fittest\r\nsurvive. Merit is the supreme and only qualification essential to\r\nsuccess. Intelligence rules worlds and systems of worlds. It is the\r\ndread monarch of illimitable space, and in human society, especially in\r\nAmerica, it shines as a diadem on the foreheads of those who stand in\r\nthe foremost ranks of human enterprise. Here only a natural order of\r\nnobility is recognized, and its motto, without coat of arms or boast of\r\nheraldry, is “Intelligence and integrity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n                 ARBITRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SYSTEM OF SETTLING DISPUTES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS BY ARBITRATION\r\n    HAS WORKED IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE.—WHY NOT EXTEND THE SYSTEM TO\r\n    BUSINESS MATTERS GENERALLY?—ITS GREAT ADVANTAGES OVER GOING TO\r\n    LAW.—IT IS CHEAP AND HAS NO VEXATIOUS DELAYS.—TRIAL BY JURY A\r\n    PARTIAL FAILURE.—SOME PROMINENT CASES IN POINT.—JURY “FIXING” AND\r\n    ITS CONSEQUENCES.—HOW JURIES ARE SWAYED BY THEIR SYMPATHIES.—A\r\n    CURIOUS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE BEFORE A REFEREE.—THE LITTLE GAME OF\r\n    THE DIAMOND BROKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street has derived great prestige and character from the New York\r\nStock Exchange. In fact, the Stock Exchange is Wall Street, so to speak,\r\nso much so that if the Exchange moved to any other locality, the latter\r\nwould become the new Wall Street, to the utter oblivion of the old,\r\nwhich would soon be eclipsed and regarded as a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe New York Stock Exchange has distinguished itself in many respects,\r\nbut there is probably nothing for which it is likely to become more\r\nfamous in history than its solution of the great problem of settling\r\ndisputes and misunderstandings by arbitration. Other financial bodies\r\nhave tried the same substitute for ordinary law proceedings, but it\r\nwould appear that greater success has crowned the efforts of the Stock\r\nExchange in this particular experiment than any other corporate body.\r\n\r\nThe large number of cases on record that have been amicably settled by\r\narbitration within the past few years, in which law would have been\r\nformerly considered indispensable, seem to point to a period, probably\r\nnot far distant, when arbitration will be the great and ultimate court\r\nof appeal in the large majority of civil cases. Several considerations\r\nwill make it the most popular. It is cheaper, less complicated, not\r\nsubject to vexatious delay; it is more equitable, and the members\r\ncomposing the Arbitration Committees are business men, who are quick to\r\ndiscern, accurate in perception, sound in judgment and decisive in\r\ndrawing their conclusions on business principles.\r\n\r\nThe expense of arbitration is a mere trifle compared with the enormous\r\nsums swallowed up in litigation.\r\n\r\nTransactions involving millions of dollars annually in the Stock\r\nExchange are made subject to settlement by this method of arbitration in\r\nthe event of any difference of opinion arising in any particular case.\r\nVery few instances occur in which there is any necessity to carry the\r\ncase beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Committee.\r\n\r\nThe number of cases actually settled in this way would probably cost\r\nhalf a million dollars annually if they had to be brought into court, to\r\nsay nothing of the incidental expenses, which would amount to as much\r\nmore, arising from delay, on the scale of present charges by the legal\r\nprofession, even leaving out our own Evarts, who is probably the Boss\r\ncharger of the Bar.\r\n\r\nThe success attending the system at the Stock Exchange, I think, goes\r\nfar to prove that the method might be universally extended to the great\r\npecuniary interest and personal comfort of business men throughout the\r\ncountry, for the adjustment of their misunderstandings and grievances\r\namong one another.\r\n\r\nMy object in writing upon this subject has for its basis the hope that\r\nthis chapter may catch the eye of some of our great merchants in this\r\nand other large cities, and that it may suggest to those of them who\r\nhave not contemplated the subject already, the advisability and\r\nnecessity of establishing for themselves a similar method of arbitration\r\nto that which has been so successful in the Stock Exchange, to be final\r\nand without appeal, in their respective business affairs.\r\n\r\nExperience has fully demonstrated that trial by jury is in innumerable\r\ninstances a signal failure; especially has this been so since what is\r\nknown as “jury fixing” has become so common in the courts. The practice\r\nof bribing jurors has now become a secret profession, and is so ably\r\nconducted that it is almost impossible, except in rare instances, to\r\nexpose it.\r\n\r\nBut apart from this vicious and criminal practice of tampering with\r\njuries, there are many other reasons why it is next to impossible, in a\r\nlarge variety of instances, to obtain justice from an ordinary jury.\r\n\r\nHuman sympathy plays a very important part in the verdicts of juries\r\ngenerally. I mean by this, class sympathy. A business man who is\r\nregarded by the community as rich and powerful, can hardly expect\r\njustice from a common jury unless the party opposed to him occupies a\r\nsimilar station in society. Where the position of either the plaintiff\r\nor defendant calls forth sympathy with regard to worldly means, in the\r\nlarge majority of cases the ordinary jurors will bring in a verdict in\r\nfavor of the man of small or moderate means, believing that they are in\r\nduty bound to sympathize with the oppressed. In a case where a clerk or\r\na woman, for instance, is a party to the suit, it is next to impossible\r\nfor a man of means to receive equity at the hands of the great palladium\r\nof our liberty. I am sorry it is so, but I speak feelingly in this\r\nmatter, as I have myself been a victim of this unworthy class prejudice,\r\nin a country where all men are theoretically equal.\r\n\r\nCounsel usually make a great display over the cases of impecunious\r\nclients, out of all proportion to their magnitude. Mole hills become\r\nostensibly transformed into mountains in the eye of the highly\r\nimaginative lawyer, who works himself up into such a dramatic pitch of\r\nenthusiasm about the wrongs of his client, that he appears to be in dead\r\nearnest. He infuses the same feeling into the jury, who are beguiled\r\ninto solemnity by the force of forensic oratory, and fail to appreciate\r\nthe farcical side of the case, but are totally swayed by sentiment and\r\nprejudice, to the utter exclusion of the evidence.\r\n\r\nThere are many objections, also, to trial or partial trial, by referee,\r\nalthough it is in many instances an improvement on the jury system. It\r\nis, however, amenable to numerous and flagrant abuses.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this, I shall briefly relate a case which some time\r\nago came within the sphere of my own observation.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of my acquaintance had a claim for a very large amount\r\nagainst a financial man in good circumstances, and it was sent to a\r\nreferee, who, after a long, tedious and exhaustive investigation of all\r\nthe facts, gave a decision in favor of the plaintiff for several hundred\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nSoon after the decision, the defendant saw the plaintiff, and made him\r\nan offer of thirty thousand dollars to settle the matter, at the same\r\ntime stating that if he did not accept the offer, he would either appeal\r\nthe case or hunt up fresh evidence for a new trial.\r\n\r\nThis offer of settlement, which was but a small part of the amount\r\nawarded by the judgment, was naturally declined by the plaintiff, and\r\napplication was made to the court under the pretense of newly discovered\r\nevidence, for a new trial, which was granted. Thereupon, after another\r\ntedious trial, the old beaten track having been gone carefully over\r\nagain, without omitting any of the aforesaid “whereases, neverthelesses\r\nand notwithstandings,” or any of the monotonous flummery connected\r\ntherewith, the case was again sent to the same referee, before whom the\r\nsame wearisome inquiry was repeated. This time, however, the referee\r\nrelieved the monotony, at the close, by rendering a decision in favor of\r\nthe defendant, for a large sum, instead of the plaintiff, as on the\r\nformer occasion.\r\n\r\nThis decision was a genuine surprise to the plaintiff, who then called\r\nupon the defendant and expressed in severe terms his indignation at the\r\nchange that had been unwarrantably made in the decision of the referee,\r\nsaying he would not submit to it. He was extremely firm in his manner\r\nand said: “I positively assure you that if the judgment is enforced this\r\ntown will not be large enough to hold you and myself.”\r\n\r\nThe successful defendant then said, “What do you want me to do?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the plaintiff magnanimously, “I simply desire to be\r\nreleased of that judgment.”\r\n\r\n“Will that satisfy you?” asked the other litigant.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied, “under the circumstances. I have had enough of such\r\nlaw, and want to get rid of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the defendant, “I will do it, and give you a receipt in\r\nfull in satisfaction of all claims.”\r\n\r\nAfter this cordial termination of the trouble, the defendant turned to\r\nthe plaintiff and said confidentially, “I am sorry you did not take the\r\nthirty thousand dollars which I offered you. I would sooner you had it\r\nthan anyone else, as I had to pay it all the same.”\r\n\r\nThe profound lesson of humility taught in Scripture, that “the first\r\nshall be last and the last first,” was fully verified in this instance.\r\n\r\nAs litigation is now carried on either before a jury or a referee, it\r\nhas a tendency to stir up bad blood, which grows worse as the case\r\nprogresses through its various and lengthy stages, leaving relations\r\nmore strained and matters for both parties much worse at the end than at\r\nthe beginning. As the case drags its slow length along criminations and\r\nrecriminations between plaintiff and defendant are constantly elicited,\r\nand family matters that should be regarded as sacred are dragged before\r\nthe eyes of the public, subjected to unfriendly criticism, and innocent\r\nparties who have no interest in the case are subject to have their\r\nprivate affairs made known, to their great mortification, and often to\r\ntheir great detriment, having a cloud thrown over their reputation long\r\nafter the litigants have passed away.\r\n\r\nThus the evils of litigation are far reaching in their consequences, and\r\nfrequently exercise a most deleterious influence over the character and\r\nprosperity of those who have nothing to do with the original parties to\r\nthe contest, and have no interest in the suit.\r\n\r\nThe expense is also another important consideration in going to law, and\r\nis only to be measured by the bank balances of the contending parties.\r\n\r\nThe time lost in the methods of procedure now generally adopted is of\r\nthe utmost importance, especially to people the success of whose\r\nbusiness in a large measure may depend on their personal attention\r\nthereto. It is perfectly astounding to reflect on the important portion\r\nof a person’s existence that may be lost in one case, which, from its\r\ninception in the lower court up through the regular gradations of the\r\nSupreme Court and Court of Appeals when a new trial is had, probably\r\nthus going over the entire ground twice, may consume all the way from\r\nfive to ten years under the perpetual pressure of mental anxiety and\r\ntorture before the end is reached, when at least one, and sometimes both\r\nparties, are financially ruined.\r\n\r\nThe worry, wear and tear of attending to a lawsuit in the capacity of\r\neither plaintiff or defendant is perfectly incomprehensible to those who\r\nhave never passed through the trying ordeal. A person in either\r\ncapacity, with his train of witnesses, is obliged to dance attendance on\r\ncourt every day, no matter how pressing the necessities of his own\r\nbusiness may be. Books must be carried thither, and all his\r\nestablishment must be upset for the convenience of the court and to\r\ngratify the whims and caprices of the opposing litigant. The business\r\nplaces of the two contending parties are entirely disarranged, and the\r\nhelp thrown into a state of partial disorganization. Each party to the\r\nsuit seeks to give the other all the trouble he possibly can, and to\r\nsubject him to all the sources of annoyance his imagination can devise.\r\nSuch is the spirit imbued by going to law.\r\n\r\nA lawyer, therefore, who has about half a dozen moderate cases has thus\r\nhis entire time occupied, and while his clients keep out of bankruptcy\r\nhis income is as good as the annuity of a life insurance company, and\r\nfrequently the security is better.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the change which I propose, in the majority of cases where\r\nmerchants and business men find it necessary now to resort to legal\r\nmethods, would perhaps not render the life of the ordinary lawyer so\r\nhappy as it is under the present system, but the merchants would gain\r\nten-fold more than the lawyers would lose, so the effect upon the entire\r\ncommunity would be incalculably beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe system of arbitration which I contemplate could be extended in every\r\nline of business throughout the entire country, with a Central\r\nAssociation in New York or any other city that might be agreed upon. In\r\nfact, there might be several business centres, one in each important\r\ncity, with its ramifications extending throughout the section in which\r\nits commercial interests more immediately clustered. Branch associations\r\ncould be organized in the smaller cities and towns, enjoying all the\r\nfacilities of direct communication with the central body, and availing\r\nthemselves of all the information and statistics there collected, and\r\nthe nature of decisions in special and leading cases of settlement.\r\n\r\nEach association in its own city or town should be considered fully\r\ncompetent to deal with its own affairs, the Central Association being\r\nonly consulted as an advisory body. I should recommend also that each\r\nassociation should have a governing committee, which should constitute\r\nits Court of Appeal, whose decision should be deemed final.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be necessary to prescribe penalties for the few isolated\r\ncases that would kick against the arbitration system, and resort to law,\r\nas their legal experience before they got through would be punishment\r\nsufficient without the association taking any further action.\r\nDiscipline, however, of a mild character, would have to be enforced in\r\nthese and other special cases, for the better efficiency of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to have a rule whereby the parties submitting their\r\ncases to arbitration should recognize the necessity, after having the\r\nmethods of procedure thoroughly explained to them, of putting themselves\r\nunder obligations to abide by the decision.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out a national idea of this kind of association, business\r\ncould be greatly facilitated and much expense saved by the various\r\ncommittees having due regard to their places of meeting, so as to be as\r\nnear as possible to the centre of the greater number of the witnesses in\r\neach particular case.\r\n\r\nThe courts, which are now greatly overworked, would be immensely\r\nrelieved by this system, and they would have more time to sift important\r\nand exceptional cases which, in their nature, could not possibly be made\r\nsubjects of arbitration. There are quite enough of such cases to occupy\r\nthe time of the various courts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most vexatious and irritating things connected with court\r\ntrials is the constant attendance required, even when no progress is\r\nbeing made in the case. The expenses, too, are always accumulating.\r\n\r\nThough nothing is accomplished the attendance of the lawyers is far from\r\nbeing a labor of love. Their services must be handsomely rewarded by the\r\nlitigants.\r\n\r\nSuch a process of settlement as I suggest would not, after all, be any\r\ngreat hardship to the best of the legal fraternity, as there would be\r\nenough work left for them, but it would afford immense relief to the now\r\noverworked judges, while it would facilitate and forward the ends of\r\njustice to an extent that can hardly be imagined by those who have been\r\nalways accustomed to the slow and monotonous machinery of the law\r\ncourts, and it would help to weed out the large camp following of\r\npettifoggers, whose occupation would be partially gone.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of time lost in regular court business, causing\r\nmuch exasperation to the parties to a suit, in settling mere\r\ntechnicalities and side issues of law, before the real merits of the\r\ncase can be reached. Many of these technical delays could be easily\r\ndisposed of by business men, on business principles, and by taking a\r\nsimple and common-sense view of the matter, by the usual methods pursued\r\nin arbitration.\r\n\r\nThis new method of settling disputes would do away with the farce of\r\ngiving bonds in many cases, which is another great source of annoyance,\r\nand which, after all, only amounts to a mere formality in a large number\r\nof cases, and in many others a very hollow and fraudulent pretense, as\r\nmany of the bondsmen are only men of straw, and though technically\r\nqualified, are not in reality responsible for the obligations undertaken\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nWhen good, reliable sureties are offered, in many instances they are put\r\nthrough an irritating course of examination in relation to their private\r\naffairs, much of which is entirely unnecessary, and only designed to\r\nperplex and annoy them. They are thus obliged to expose matters relating\r\nto their private business, about which the public have no right to know\r\nanything, and they are often examined in such a way, as if they\r\nthemselves were on trial, and were attempting criminal concealment of\r\nsomething that they had a right to disclose. A good deal of this arises\r\nfrom the impudent, unmannerly style of certain lawyers, who treat a man\r\nas a criminal suspect, when he has no interest in the case whatever, but\r\nhas simply come voluntarily forward to assist a friend in trouble.\r\n\r\nThis is all, however, in the present method of procedure, connected with\r\nthe machinery of so-called justice, and this kind of abuse has been\r\ncarried to such an extent in some of the instances just referred to,\r\nthat very few responsible parties, who know anything about the _modus\r\noperandi_ of qualifying as a surety, are willing to respond to such\r\ncalls of friendship. Hence, one of the difficulties in obtaining good\r\nbondsmen, and an additional reason why the professional straw men are so\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nIt probably helps the business of the latter, between whom and the\r\nabusive lawyers there may be an understanding on “boodle” principles.\r\n\r\nI shall relate an instance which I consider worthy of permanent record\r\nillustrative of the matters to which I here refer, in which my firm was\r\nvictimized.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion referred to, my firm sued a client for a just debt of\r\nsixteen thousand dollars. The case was sent to a referee, whose\r\nstanding, in his particular line, was unquestioned at the time, and very\r\nfew men, in his circle, had better family connections. He stood high in\r\nhis profession and both sideS were satisfied with the choice. The case\r\nwas very long and tedious, having been drawn out to a most provoking\r\nextent by encumbering the record with immense piles of irrelevant\r\nmatter. The renewed calls for legal fees on both sides were numerous and\r\nvexatious, yet there was no help but graceful submission to the payment\r\nof this tribute.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of years it was reluctantly conceded by the lawyers that\r\nthe evidence was all in on both sides. The litigants breathed heavy and\r\nresponsive sighs of relief, each side being confident of victory.\r\n\r\nA short time prior to the close of the case, the referee spoke to me,\r\ngratuitously offering his advice to settle the case, as he said he\r\nintended to give a decision adverse to my firm. To this I demurred, and\r\nexpressed my determination to fight the case to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nThe result was, however, that my firm not only did not get a decision in\r\nits favor for the $16,000 to which it was justly entitled, but this\r\nclaim was wiped out by this Daniel come to judgment, who gave a decision\r\nin favor of the defendant for $132,000.\r\n\r\nI regarded this award as such a terrible outrage upon justice that I\r\nobtained a stay of proceedings, and made an appeal, setting forth\r\ntherein the advice given to me by the referee to settle before the case\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\nJudge Fancher, who wrote the opinion on behalf of the bench, consigned\r\nthat referee to everlasting disgrace, and set aside his opinion. There\r\nthe case ended.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in my experience will illustrate the point which I have\r\nmade in regard to the sympathy exhibited by juries with those whom they\r\nregard, rightly or wrongly, as oppressed. At one time I had employed a\r\nclerk at the rate of $2,000 per annum. He was a great disappointment to\r\nme in regard to competency, for the work for which I had engaged him,\r\nand for his entire lack of application to, as well as deficiency in, the\r\ndepartment to which he was assigned. At the end of the first year,\r\ntherefore, I gave him notice, in presence of two competent witnesses,\r\nthat I should not require him after his year had expired, and advised\r\nhim to look out at once for another situation. On the last day of the\r\nyear he came to me with tears in his eyes and said that he had been\r\nunable to obtain another place, owing to the bad times prevailing, and\r\nbegged me, in the name of his family, who was solely dependent upon him,\r\nto keep him in my services still longer, until he could get another\r\nsituation. Purely out of sympathy for his condition, and believing his\r\nstory, which was very plausible and pathetic, I told him that he might\r\nremain a short time longer on the same salary, but that I should require\r\nhim to use all his exertions to get another place as speedily as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered on the second term his services were no more use to me\r\nthan a fifth wheel is to a coach. After the expiration of a few weeks, I\r\nsent for him and inquired if he had got another situation; I said I had\r\ngiven him ample time to obtain one, and that I could not consent to keep\r\nhim any longer. I therefore requested my cashier to draw a check to his\r\norder for the balance of his wages, up to date, filled in as a part of\r\nthe body thereof with the words “payment in full for all claims and\r\ndemands.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he left my employment, but called repeatedly at the office\r\nafterward. I assumed that his visits were simply for the purpose of\r\npaying his respects. At the expiration of the second year I received a\r\nnotice of suit which he had commenced in Brooklyn for the balance of\r\nsalary due him for the year, being at the rate of $2,000 a year for ten\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe case came up duly in the Brooklyn court, his only witness being his\r\nfather, who had made several calls upon me after the discharge of his\r\nson, on the strength of which he set forth, in his evidence, certain\r\nconferences that should have taken place between him and myself, the\r\ngreater part of which were purely fictitious. He was the only witness\r\ncalled on the side of the plaintiff, while I had five or more witnesses\r\nto substantiate the facts, as I have related them, in relation to the\r\nyoung man’s discharge, all of them being of most excellent character.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the jury entirely ignored the overwhelming testimony on\r\nmy side, and seemed to be altogether influenced by the “spread-eagle”\r\naddress of the defendant’s counsel, which I am free to say was both able\r\nand ingenious. He drew a harassing picture of the poverty of the young\r\nman, and presented the imminent destitution of his family in a most\r\npitiable light, brought about solely by the ruthless treatment of this\r\nhard-hearted millionaire and bloated bondholder. Hence the verdict was\r\nmade, through the force of counsel’s oratory, to depend exclusively on\r\nthe sympathy of the jury, irrespective of the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe case occupied several days, with five or six employees from my\r\noffice in constant attendance, who were obliged to carry to and from\r\ncourt, every day, huge books and large quantities of papers, disturbing\r\nthe regular business of the office in a very disagreeable manner.\r\n\r\nAfter counsel had gone over the ordinary rigmarole in reviewing the\r\ntestimony, the jury went through the formality of retiring, to keep up\r\nappearances, and after a brief interval of absence returned to court\r\nwith a verdict for the deeply injured clerk for back pay, together with\r\ninterest for the ten months during which he had not rendered me an\r\nhour’s service.\r\n\r\nMy lawyer was easily able to obtain fresh evidence from other sources,\r\nbut he had not considered it necessary to put any more witnesses on the\r\nstand, as he had regarded the testimony already produced more than\r\nample, so sanguine was he of success, and so fully satisfied of the\r\nplainness of his case, which he considered had only one side, and that\r\nin my favor.\r\n\r\nThe jury, however, put the boot on the other foot, upset all my\r\ncounsel’s calculations and showed him that his law went for nothing\r\nwhere the famous twelve had the right to judge and legislate at the same\r\ntime in accordance with their sympathies and prejudices. Still he went\r\nthrough the formality of going before the judge with new evidence, and\r\napplied for a new trial, which was ordered on the ground that the\r\nverdict was not in accordance with the weight of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe new case was called after the customary delays, and the same ground\r\nwas duly traversed again, with my additional witnesses, before another\r\nhighly intelligent jury, whose prejudices were all on the side of the\r\ngreatly injured young man, who sought twelve months’ pay for two months’\r\nuseless services. The only witness that appeared again for the defendant\r\nwas his faithful and veracious father, whose memory was marvellously\r\ncorrect in relation to his former statements on the first trial.\r\n\r\nThere is an old proverb which says that it requires such men to have\r\ngood memories. I need not quote it, as almost everyone knows it.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, however, that forensic orator appeared again\r\nfor his poverty-stricken client, armed with all the old enthusiasm\r\nexhibited on the former trial. He had not much new matter to present,\r\nbut his dramatic attributes, by dint of longer practice, and more\r\nfamiliarity with his side of the case (it was only necessary for him to\r\nstudy the one side) had become considerably improved since his former\r\neffort, and it is needless to say that he carried the jury with him.\r\n\r\nBy that intelligent safeguard of our liberties, the jury, the second\r\ntrial was only regarded as an aggravated case of persecution, on my\r\npart, and the verdict was given more cheerfully in favor of the\r\nplaintiff than on the former occasion.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would have been much better for me, from a financial point\r\nof view, to have paid the amount of the exaction, with all the legal and\r\nillegal fees and impositions connected therewith, yet I felt disinclined\r\nto be bamboozled in that way.\r\n\r\nWhen the court was applied to for another new trial, the judge said, “I\r\nhave already given you one new trial, taking the responsibility. The\r\nrelief you now ask has already been before two juries, and I am not\r\nwilling to take upon me any additional responsibility in the matter. You\r\nmust therefore look for any further rights or redress to which you may\r\nconsider yourself entitled, to the Court of Appeals.”\r\n\r\nThe case is now, therefore, awaiting the good time and discretion of the\r\nCourt of Appeals, where it will, in all probability, be heard and\r\nadjudicated upon sometime within the next ten years. In the meantime the\r\nyoung man is happy in the reflection that his judgment is a good\r\ninvestment, drawing six per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nThere is still another case illustrative of some of the peculiar points\r\nreferred to, and showing the truth of the maxim among lawyers that, “You\r\nnever know what a jury will do,” in which I had the honor, or the\r\nmisfortune to be joined.\r\n\r\nA well-known outside broker in Wall Street, who had a large experience\r\nin transacting business for Mr. Sage and other notabilities of the\r\nstreet, in “puts,” “calls,” and other exterior securities, came to me\r\none afternoon and asked me if I didn’t want to buy a pair of diamond\r\nearrings.\r\n\r\nAt that time I had not begun my career as a dealer in diamonds, except\r\nin one solitary instance, and that was when I purchased the wedding\r\nring, which is one of the requisites in a matrimonial contract for a\r\nlong term. I was, therefore, comparatively a tyro in the business, and\r\nthe party with whom I was dealing did not fail to take advantage of my\r\ninexperience. I made some inquiry about the diamonds from this broker,\r\nto which I received apparently satisfactory answers, and I concluded\r\nthey would suit my wife, and as I had had a good day’s business I made\r\nhim an offer of a thousand dollars for the precious ornaments, which he\r\nquickly accepted, and I paid him the money.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few weeks after I was waited upon by a diamond dealer\r\nand his lawyer, with neither of whom I had the honor of any previous\r\nacquaintance, and they accordingly introduced each other. The diamond\r\ndealer introduced the lawyer and _vice versa_. I immediately concluded I\r\nwas going to get a good stock order from both of them, but I was soon\r\ndisappointed as well as surprised to find that these gentlemen had\r\ncalled on an entirely different kind of business, which was totally\r\ndevoid of commissions on any stock transactions.\r\n\r\nThey said I had a pair of earrings belonging to them, and I declined to\r\ngive them up except on return of my thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen bade me good day, and in the course of time I was\r\nserved with the usual legal papers in a suit which reached the calendar\r\nafter some time. The young man who sold me the diamonds was put on the\r\nstand. He testified that he had received them from a certain diamond\r\nbroker, but not the dealer in question, with whom he had had no\r\nconnection whatever.\r\n\r\nThe diamond broker, it appeared, had long been agent for this dealer,\r\nselling diamonds and had, as set forth in the evidence, sold over ten\r\nthousand dollars’ worth in a few years.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial a paper was produced to prove that this broker had\r\nreceived these diamonds to show them to a customer, and as it turned out\r\nI happened to be the customer. The money which I had paid him for them\r\nhe had failed to turn over to his employer, of whom I had no knowledge,\r\nnor had I any chance of knowing him in the transaction.\r\n\r\nAll the facts were presented, as above related, to the jury, who, after\r\ndue deliberation, decided that I must give up the diamonds and suffer to\r\nbe cheated out of my thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThis case is now on appeal. I have since offered to relinquish the\r\ndiamonds and lose my money, rather than suffer the expense and trouble\r\nof continuing the litigation, but plaintiff wants to bleed me further to\r\nthe tune of $300 to cover his law expenses. To this illegal tribute I\r\nhave not yet submitted, and have resolved to see what virtue there is in\r\nfurther defense before a higher tribunal.\r\n\r\n“Millions of dollars for defence, but not a dollar for tribute,” is a\r\nmaxim which it is expensive to follow, but after all, the result of such\r\na course, if one can afford it, may be morally healthy.\r\n\r\nI consider that these cases, in which I acted a rather unenviable part,\r\nare only samples of many which constitute one of the best arguments for\r\na general system of arbitration, such as I have briefly and imperfectly\r\noutlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n        NEW YORK AS A FINANCIAL CENTRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS PAST, ITS PRESENT, ITS FUTURE.—BANKING DECADENCE.—GROWTH OF INTERIOR\r\n    CENTRES.—OBSTRUCTION FROM THE NATIONAL BANK LAWS.—RELIEF\r\n    DEMANDED.—REQUIREMENTS OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat New York has been as a centre for the settlement of financial\r\ntransactions is a matter of history; what it is destined to be, in that\r\nrespect, may not be so entirely certain as some people hastily assume.\r\nThere are some facts which seem to suggest the question whether our city\r\nmay prove able to retain its past proportion of the vast settlements of\r\nthis ever-growing continent; and, although there is nothing to warrant\r\nvery positive opinions about the future, it must be conceded as an\r\nunquestionable historic fact that in late years there have been symptoms\r\nof positive decadence in the status of our financial metropolis.\r\n\r\nIn the past there have been three separate successive sets of conditions\r\ndirectly affecting the financial standing of New York. First, there was\r\nthe period when this city was the distributing point for nearly all the\r\nimportations, and for the bulk of our domestic manufactures through all\r\nparts of the country. Equally, New York was the almost sole port of\r\nexport for Western products, and although the exports for the cotton\r\nStates were made direct from their local ports, yet the financial\r\ntransactions connected with those shipments were effected through this\r\ncity. Then New York had virtually no competitor as an exchange centre.\r\n\r\nNext came a period during which the larger Western cities, especially\r\nChicago and St. Louis, aspired to become distributors of foreign and\r\nEastern merchandise; a change very naturally following the rapid growth\r\nof population in the West and Southwest. Thus a vast jobbing trade\r\nbecame rapidly established at these interior centres, and New York’s\r\nshare in the distribution of goods to the retail trade became, in a\r\nlarge measure, confined to the Middle and nearer Western States, and to\r\na portion of the South. The jobbers of these new interior centres,\r\nhowever, had still to get their supplies of merchandise from or through\r\nthe Eastern metropolis; so that, whilst we lost much of our jobbing\r\nbusiness, we retained, with some limited exceptions, the importing and\r\ncommission branches, together with their ordinary rate of increase.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the beginning of a third and still more important era,\r\nduring which both the importing and commission branches of our trade are\r\nthreatened with invasion. The Western jobbing houses have attained a\r\nstanding which warrants their importing direct from the countries of\r\nproduction, instead of through New York. Another Western and\r\nSouthwestern consumption has risen to such a magnitude as to encourage\r\nthe creation of manufacturing establishments in the vicinity of the\r\nmarkets. The West is rapidly becoming a competitor in the leading\r\nbranches of manufacture with the East, and is evidently destined to\r\nsupply itself, at no distant day, with a very large portion of the\r\ndomestic merchandise hitherto contributed through New York merchants,\r\nand with the facilities of New York banks. Nor is this all. Chicago and\r\nsome other Western cities are throwing off their dependence on New York\r\nintermediaries for the exportation of grain and provisions, selling them\r\ndirect to Europe, and shipping the goods on through bills of lading.\r\n\r\nThese changes are not the result of any mere spirit of blind\r\nrecklessness grasping after business. They are the product of actual\r\nnatural economies, and appear to be so decidedly in the interest of the\r\nWestern merchants that it can hardly be doubted that the new methods\r\nhave come “to stay.”\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the natural development of national production of\r\ncommerce is to build up independent financial centres at the interior,\r\nthe effect of which can only be to check in some measure the growing\r\nascendancy of New York. Perhaps few among my readers will be prepared\r\nfor the following statistical facts bearing on this question; the\r\nconclusions to be drawn from which are not very flattering to the pride\r\nof the “Gothamites.”\r\n\r\nThe transactions at the New York Clearing House are the surest\r\nindication of the standing and progress of this city as a financial\r\ncentre. The records of that institution show that its annual exchanges\r\nrose step by step from 5,750 million dollars in 1854 to 48,566 in 1881,\r\nan increase of 744 per cent. in 27 years, or at the average rate of\r\n1,585 millions per year. From 1881 there has been the following\r\nremarkable rate of decline:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In 1881, the exchanges were 48,566 millions of dollars.\r\n    In 1882, the exchanges were 46,553 millions of dollars.\r\n    In 1883, the exchanges were 40,293 millions of dollars.\r\n    In 1884, the exchanges were 34,092 millions of dollars.\r\n    In 1885, the exchanges were 25,251 millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that there has been a decline in the transactions\r\nof the Clearing House banks of 23,315 millions, or at the rate of 48.4\r\nper cent., within the last four years. Last year the exchanges fell\r\nbelow even those of twenty years previous, when the amount was 26,032\r\nmillions. Of course, this very remarkable decrease in the volume of\r\ntransactions is, in part, attributable to the great falling off in the\r\namount of speculative transactions in 1885, as compared with 1881. This,\r\nhowever, can only account to a comparatively small extent for such a\r\nvast change. Something is also to be attributed to the general decline\r\nin the prices of merchandise and investments during the period; but this\r\nexplanation is also entirely inadequate, for the average fall in prices\r\ndid certainly not exceeded 20 per cent., while the decrease in the\r\nexchanges, as already shown, had been 48.4 per cent. Moreover, on the\r\nother side, some offset against the decline in speculation and in prices\r\nmust be allowed on account of an increase of five to six millions in the\r\npopulation of the country during the interval; which, alone should call\r\nfor an increase of 10 per cent. within this period. It is still more\r\nsignificant that, since the year 1872, the capital of the banks in the\r\nNew York Clearing House has been reduced from $84,400,000 to\r\n$58,600,000, a decline of 30 per cent.; which at least implies that\r\nbanking has become less profitable than it formerly was, and which could\r\nscarcely have happened if New York had retained its wonted share of the\r\nincrease of financial operations arising from the growth of population\r\nand commerce in the nation at large.\r\n\r\nSome light may be thrown on these changes by a comparison between the\r\nratio of progress in the transactions of the Clearing Houses of New York\r\nand Chicago respectively.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the first complete year of the Chicago Clearing House, the\r\nclearings amounted to $453,800,000, while in 1885 the figures reached\r\n$2,318,500,000—an increase of 410 per cent. At New York, in 1866, the\r\nclearings were $28,717,000,000, and in 1885 they had fallen to\r\n$25,250,000,000—a decrease of 12½ per cent. within two decades of great\r\nnational progress, and while the population tributary to this city had\r\nincreased over twenty millions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879—the period of the resumption of specie payments and of\r\nthe beginning of a great revival of commerce and of financial\r\nenterprise—the Chicago Clearings were $1,257,700,000, and last year they\r\nwere $2,318,500,000, showing an increase of 84.3 per cent. The clearings\r\nat New York, within the same period, show an increase of about ¼ of one\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the capital of the banks in the New York\r\nClearing House (exclusive of surplus) fell 30 per cent. below 1872 and\r\n1886; on the other hand, the capital of the banks in the Chicago\r\nClearing House rose from $9,845,000 in 1872 to $16,928,000 in the\r\npresent year, an increase of 72 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing comparisons show that although the clearings at Chicago\r\nare only about one-tenth those of New York, yet the former city is\r\nmaking very rapid strides, while here we are virtually retrograding, and\r\nconfirm the conclusion above expressed, that the importance of New York\r\nas a financial centre is suffering from diversion of settlements and of\r\nbanking facilities to the larger cities of the interior, and especially\r\nto Chicago.\r\n\r\nSo far as this tendency is the result of natural changes in conditions,\r\nit is inevitable and must be permanent, if, indeed, it be not destined\r\nto gain in force and extent. But so far as the change is due to\r\nartificial obstructions to banking operations, it is susceptible of\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may be permitted to venture certain suggestions which may\r\nquite possibly encounter objections from men more than my peers in\r\nbanking experience and wisdom. It has long been my conviction that the\r\nbanking arrangements existing at New York are far from satisfying the\r\nrequirements of a city that not only aspires to be, but also possesses\r\nmany adaptations for occupying the position of the great financial\r\ncentre, not only for domestic settlements, but also for international\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of our banking transactions are done by banks incorporated\r\nunder either national or State laws. Admirably as the national banking\r\nsystem, taken as a whole, is constructed, yet it includes some important\r\npositive disqualifications for its institutions performing an important\r\nclass of operations essential to a great centre of exchanges. It was,\r\nperhaps, not to be expected that a system designed mainly for provincial\r\ncities and for rural populations should adequately provide for these\r\nbroader wants. Nor could any uniform and homogeneous system be expected\r\nto be very perfect and satisfy at the same time both classes of\r\nrequirements. Interior banks, whose management must be expected to be\r\nmore or less lacking in experience and competency, may need to be placed\r\nunder legal restraints, which, in the case of a thoroughly conducted\r\nmetropolitan bank, would be not only needless, but positively injurious.\r\nUnfortunately, this discrimination has received little recognition in\r\nour national bank legislation; on the contrary, that larger discretion\r\nwhich should have been conceded to the higher training and more select\r\nability that administer the metropolitan banks, has been ignored, and\r\nheavier restrictions have been placed upon the New York national banks\r\nthan upon those of any other part of the national system.\r\n\r\nThe “reserve” laws are oppressive to no better purpose than that of\r\npositive injury. All other banks than those of New York are permitted to\r\ncount in their reserves any funds resting with their “redemption\r\nagents;” and this item usually constitutes, in the case of banks of the\r\n“other reserve cities,” 41 per cent. of the total reserves held, and in\r\nthe case of all other banks about 60 per cent. The New York banks, on\r\nthe contrary are compelled to hold their _entire_ reserve (25 per cent.\r\nof their deposits) in the form of lawful money. Nor is this the heaviest\r\nembargo. The reserves are not permitted to be used when the occasion\r\narises for which a bank reserve is always presumed to be provided. The\r\nmoment a bank allows its reserve to fall below the required 25 per cent.\r\nit becomes the duty of the Comptroller of the Currency to close its\r\ndoors and put it into liquidation if the deficiency be not immediately\r\nmade good. If panic occurs, and depositors want their money, there is\r\nnowhere any power to relax the crushing force of this law, and the banks\r\nare therefore compelled to suspend payment to depositors and in order to\r\navert general ruin at such times they have to resort to the expedient of\r\nmaking their cash assets available in common, thereby saving themselves\r\nand their customers outside of and in spite of the destructive tendency\r\nof the law. Of course, the danger of running into such a crisis as this\r\ncreates a feverish dread in all times of special stringency in the money\r\nmarket. All eyes are at such times fixed upon the reserve “dead line;”\r\nand, as that limit is approached, loans are artificially contracted,\r\ndepositors draw their money, and the very reserve that should be used\r\nfor elasticity and to relieve periods of special tension become the\r\ncertain cause of panic and ruin. A banking centre whose banks are\r\nperiodically exposed to dangers of this serious character, and where the\r\nlaw unites with adverse circumstances to foster panics, is hampered with\r\nthe worst possible disqualification for performing those higher and\r\nbroader functions of banking which demand freedom of discretion and\r\nelasticity of resource.\r\n\r\nThis evil appears all the greater when it is considered that the amount\r\nrequired to be set apart as so much idle reserve ordinarily exceeds the\r\nentire capital of the banks. It might be supposed to be serious enough\r\nthat such a large proportion of the resources of the bank should be held\r\nperpetually idle and earning no interest; but when this sacrifice of\r\nearning capacity is made for a purpose that brings no advantages, but\r\nrather a very serious danger, the effect can be nothing less than an\r\nunwholesome and very injurious restriction upon banking operations, and\r\nit is not surprising, therefore, that the national banks of New York\r\ncity exhibit decadence instead of progress.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed to enable this metropolis to reach the financial status\r\nto which it is entitled is a class of banking institutions possessing\r\nfacilities and functions much broader and freer than those conferred by\r\nthe national charters. It is out of the question to hope that these\r\nfacilities may be provided through modifications of the national bank\r\nsystem. The banks, and especially those of New York, have to encounter\r\nso much prejudice and ignorant demagogism from Congress, in seeking any\r\nmodification of the national system, that they would sooner endure\r\nalmost any wrong than demand changes in the law. Their only redress is\r\nin reorganizing under the State laws, which many of them have already\r\ndone, whilst new institutions almost uniformly prefer the State system.\r\nTo meet the wants here contemplated, it would probably be necessary to\r\nget from the State Legislature special authorization for forms and\r\nfunctions of banking not now distinctly provided for under either\r\nFederal or State laws.\r\n\r\nThe special business to be done by such a class of banks scarcely needs\r\nenumeration, much of it being so self-evident. In the present stage of\r\nour national development, it is becoming a grave reflection upon our men\r\nof capital that we should remain almost entirely dependent on foreign\r\nbankers for the facilities for transacting our immense external\r\ncommerce. The necessity that formerly existed for this dependence can no\r\nlonger be urged as an excuse. All the capital and the banking experience\r\nnecessary to found and to administer large credit and exchange\r\ninstitutions are ready to hand. A business of $1,200,000,000 per annum\r\nconnected with our imports and exports would be available for this form\r\nof enterprise. Our export trade is crippled in many branches of business\r\nsimply because it is found impossible to get the liberal credits\r\nnecessary to facilitate consignments to distant markets. Manchester\r\ndefeats us on cotton goods, not so much on the ground of prices or\r\nsuperiority of fabrics, but because her merchants can get any time or\r\namount of credit required, whilst we have to market our goods on\r\nrestricted credits and through Manchester agents, who at the same time\r\nare selling English products in competition with ours. The English\r\nexporter has the advantage of being able to get his credits from the\r\nbank with which he keeps his account, while the American has to go to a\r\nforeign banker, who has no inducement to consider his convenience or to\r\nmoderate his charges. The natural place for an export merchant to keep\r\nhis account is with the bank that grants him his credits; and this fact\r\nsuggests the facility with which banks of the kind here suggested could\r\nbuild up a large business.\r\n\r\nEvery year we find it necessary to largely pledge our cotton crop in\r\nadvance to provide the means for gathering and marketing it. Why should\r\nthis money have to be drawn from England, especially as the crop is\r\nthereby subjected to the control of the foreign buyers, and we are\r\nunable to protect our own products? These advances afford an\r\nillustration of another class of important operations in which the\r\nexisting banks cannot directly participate, but which ought properly to\r\nbe undertaken by domestic banks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our importations, what sufficient reason can be urged\r\nwhy the importer should have to get his credit from the agent of a\r\nLondon banker, instead of receiving it from an American bank through\r\nwhich he chose to transact his entire business, and which, therefore,\r\nwould be the fittest source for procuring his credits? It cannot be to\r\nthe advantage of the importer to be exposed to the vicissitudes of the\r\nEuropean money markets, nor can the London banker grant credits to\r\nmerchants 3,000 miles distant, whose position he imperfectly knows,\r\nwithout compensation for the extra risk. The business is, therefore,\r\ndone at a disadvantage to both parties. The credit should be issued\r\ndirectly from the point where the importer does his business; and this\r\nwould soon become the fact were banks to be provided possessing special\r\nadaptations for doing such a business.\r\n\r\nOther functions proper to institutions of the character here suggested\r\nwould be the negotiation of corporate loans, temporary advances to\r\ncorporations, the receiving of corporate accounts, and the facilitation\r\nof corporate reconstruction. Banking for the larger corporations\r\npresents many possibilities of advantage to both banks and companies of\r\nwhich our existing banks cannot, as at present restricted, avail\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that these suggested institutions, whilst\r\nundertaking operations of the special character above indicated, should\r\nalso aim to secure the best class of deposits and to discount the higher\r\nclass of paper. As the national bank laws would prohibit to them the\r\nprofits of circulation, it might well merit consideration whether they\r\nshould not issue to customers of high standing their own acceptances,\r\nwithin certain safe limits. These credits, yielding the current rate of\r\ninterest, would be a highly profitable, as well as an entirely\r\nlegitimate branch of business; and they have the sanction of successful\r\nusage among the best banks of London. I am unable to see what objection\r\nthere should be to further following London precedent by allowing on\r\ndeposits a rate of interest below that current in the market for the\r\ntime being. Such a course would attract accounts and would immensely\r\nincrease the power and the earning resources of the banks. Moreover, as\r\nsuch institutions, being exempt from embarrassing reserve restrictions\r\nand other needless limitations, would be less subject to the\r\noscillations of the money markets than are the present banks, they would\r\nafford better advantages to members of the Stock Exchange in the form of\r\nloans upon securities than they now are able to get. The importance of\r\nthis business may be inferred from the fact that the yearly transactions\r\nin stocks at the Exchange have averaged, for the last six years,\r\n102,000,000 shares, which, at an estimated average of $60 per share,\r\nrepresents an annual business of $6,120,000,000, to say nothing of the\r\nbusiness in bonds, which also is very large.\r\n\r\nBanks of this character would naturally attract a large portion of the\r\nStock Exchange houses, which experience has shown to be exceptionally\r\nsafe and profitable. The single fact that these banks would not be\r\nobligated to conform their loans to arbitrary 25 per cent. reserve would\r\nbe a decisive reason for Wall Street firms doing their business with\r\nsuch institutions.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the wants here alluded to have been met by our loan and\r\ntrust companies. As institutions of loan and deposit these institutions\r\nare doing important public service, and the deficiencies in the\r\nfunctions allowed to the national banks are diverting to them a large\r\nand valuable business. The companies of this character in New York and\r\nBrooklyn have nearly $14,000,000 of capital and $15,000,000 of surplus\r\nand profits. Their resources aggregate $175,000,000, and their deposits\r\n$137,000,000. Their rapid progress is indicated by the fact that, since\r\n1883, their resources have increased $32,000,000, or at the rate of 27\r\nper cent. during three years of depression in business. But while this\r\nsuccess demonstrates the great necessity for enlarged local banking\r\nfacilities, the facilities afforded by the trust companies are entirely\r\ntoo limited to satisfy the large special requirements of a great\r\nfinancial centre above referred to, and only add to the necessity for a\r\nclass of banks which shall do for New York what the great joint stock\r\nbanks and the mammoth private discount houses of London are doing for\r\nthe business of that cosmopolitan centre.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are offered for what the men of Wall Street may deem\r\nthem worth. They demonstrate that there is ample scope and urgent need\r\nfor a new element in our banking arrangements to accommodate the larger\r\noperations of finance and commerce; and it would not be difficult to\r\nprove that the country is suffering seriously from lack of such\r\nfacilities. It will not be pretended that there is any lack of either\r\nthe capital or the managerial talent requisite for such enterprise. Nor,\r\nsince the rate of interest has come to rule as low in this country as it\r\nis in Europe, have we any longer anything to fear on that ground from\r\nthe competition of foreign bankers. At any rate, if New York aspires to\r\na position of financial independence and to become, in the broadest\r\npossible sense, the financial centre of the vast and growing exchanges\r\nof this continent and of its transactions with other nations, there\r\nshould be no delay in giving this greater breadth and scope to its\r\nbanking institutions. Our merchants, I am satisfied, are ready to\r\nrespond to a movement of this character; are the bankers and the\r\ncapitalists equally prepared to provide the facilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n EARTHQUAKE THEORIES AND WALL STREET AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOCK OF EVERY CALAMITY FELT IN WALL STREET.—EARTHQUAKES THE ONLY\r\n    DISASTERS WHICH SEEM TO DEFY THE POWER OF PRECAUTION.—BECOMING A\r\n    SUBJECT OF SERIOUS THOUGHT FOR WALL STREET MEN AND BUSINESS MEN.—THE\r\n    VOLCANO THEORY OF EARTHQUAKES.—OTHER CAUSES AT WORK PRODUCING THESE\r\n    TERRIFIC UPHEAVALS.—WHY CHARLESTON WAS MORE SEVERELY SHAKEN UP THAN\r\n    NEW YORK.—WHY THE SOUTHERN EARTHQUAKE DID NOT STRIKE WALL STREET\r\n    WITH GREAT FORCE.—EARTHQUAKES LIKELY TO BECOME THE GREAT DISASTERS\r\n    OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street is the financial centre of this country as much so as London\r\nis recognized to be the financial centre of the world at the present\r\ntime. Hence it is really the heart of the nation, through which its\r\nfinancial blood flows to invigorate and impart new life to every section\r\nof the land. Hence, also, every section and city have an influence on\r\nWall Street. When the Chicago fire occurred it immediately created a\r\npanic. When a calamity occurs at any part of the country the shock is\r\nfirst felt in Wall Street. When a large failure happens, such as that of\r\na bank or important railway, in any other locality, the influence is at\r\nonce imparted to Wall Street. This is owing to the fact that Wall Street\r\nis the recognized and only market for securities of every description.\r\nAll sections are dependent upon it, because it controls the money\r\nmarket. It is the great connecting link of the financial transactions of\r\nthe whole country. A probable disaster through fire, like that which\r\noccurred at Chicago, is now no longer a terror to the Street or to the\r\ncountry, as was the case for a long time after that terrible calamity,\r\nfor the reason that methods have been adopted for the purpose of\r\nrestricting the conflagration and confining it within narrow limits.\r\nFires which occur now are soon extinguished, and it is unlikely that\r\nthey can ever play such havoc as they have done in the past. The\r\npossibility, with our enlarged experience, of taking precaution against\r\nthose various calamities has robbed fires of most of their former\r\nterrors. Science and machinery have furnished us with the means of\r\ngrappling with them.\r\n\r\nBut the one great, and now very alarming exception, which seems to defy\r\nthe power of science and every human precaution, is an earthquake. This\r\nremarkable phenomenon has awakened great interest and inspired terror in\r\nthe minds of the people at the present time, because the exhibition of\r\nits destructive powers is fresh in our memories on account of its\r\nterrific visitation at Charleston. Hence, many people are in great fear\r\nthat some other section of the country may be stricken at any moment\r\nwith a similar overwhelming disaster. It is the insidious and uncertain\r\nnature of the calamity that strikes the mind with awe. There is no\r\npossibility of anticipating it or making the least provision to avoid\r\nits dreadful consequences. The Charleston earthquake wiped out over ten\r\nmillions of property. It came, like a thief in the night, and before\r\nmorning the greater portion of the city was a mass of ruins. When we\r\nreflect on the extent of the destruction of property, it is marvellous\r\nhow few people were killed—only about one hundred, and only two or three\r\nhundred were wounded. One of the greatest wonders why this calamity\r\nshould have occurred in Charleston is, that part of the city has stood\r\nfor nearly two centuries, and the recent earthquake has been the first\r\nit has experienced. Another curious circumstance is, that the disaster\r\nshould have occurred on so large a scale there, as the locality is so\r\nfar removed from the region of any volcano.\r\n\r\nThis clearly demonstrates that the old “volcano” theory of earthquakes\r\nis thoroughly exploded, and we must seek for causes and the explanations\r\nin other quarters. Although Wall Street has not been governed by any\r\nknown law of earthquakes, except as regards the fluctuations of the\r\nproperties in a bear market dealt in at the Exchange, yet a great number\r\nof Wall Street habitues, as well as other business men, are beginning to\r\nthink seriously on the subject of earthquakes, and are attempting to\r\npenetrate their causes. Reflecting upon the upheaval—or rather the\r\nsettling down of Charleston—I have come to the conclusion that similar\r\ndisasters may be looked for in other localities, hitherto not subject to\r\nthem, and considered by scientists absolutely free from these phenomena,\r\nat least on so large a scale. These peculiar disturbances that now make\r\nlife so precarious on this planet, I attribute to the innumerable and so\r\nlargely increasing excavations going on in various parts of the country,\r\nin the different mining operations, which displace the underpinning of\r\nthe surface and cause it to sink beneath the weight which it carries. Of\r\nall the great mining industries which conspire to produce earthquakes, I\r\nthink that of oil plays the most important part, and is the most\r\ntreacherous in its operations beneath the surface of the earth. The\r\npumping of oil from the bowels of the earth has been going on for thirty\r\nyears in this country in several districts. I believe it is not too\r\nlarge an estimate to state that in that time an enormous lake of oil has\r\nbeen removed, that would probably fill the basin of Lake Erie or\r\nOntario. That fluid made its way, probably, some of it from long\r\ndistances in subterraneous rivers before reaching the place where the\r\nnature of the soil permitted it to gush through a shaft to the surface,\r\nas it does in such abundance in the oil regions of Pennsylvania. Some of\r\nthose undercurrents may have come from other States, percolating through\r\nand disintegrating the soil in their passage for hundreds of miles,\r\nuntil they found an outlet, on the principle that all fluids have a\r\ntendency to find their level. There may be a great underground reservoir\r\nof this oil, which has taken many years to penetrate through the earth\r\nowing to the tendency stated, cleaving, in its subterraneous journey,\r\nfissures through ranges of mountains, and thus loosening the earth and\r\ntaking away the support from the surface wherever it has penetrated. The\r\nfluid, percolating through various strata of clay and rock, has\r\ndisplaced these in its course. Owing to this displacement there must, of\r\nnecessity, be a settling down of the land in the various regions through\r\nwhich the oil has passed, which will, of course, differ in degree owing\r\nto the density of the rock or clay. If the earth should be of a pulpy,\r\nsoft nature the settling will be greater, and when it happens to be the\r\nfoundation of a town or city the catastrophe will also be greater in\r\ninverse proportion to the degree of consistency of the earth. It is\r\npresumable, therefore, that some of the streets beneath the foundation\r\nof Charleston is of this pulpy, yielding character, and hence great was\r\nthe fall of that city.\r\n\r\nWhen New York was visited by the earthquake in 1884, and at various\r\nother times, there was only a moderate shaking up, comparatively\r\nspeaking. Why? Because its substructure is solid stone to an immense\r\ndepth, even lower than the depths of the ocean. Of these subterraneous\r\nrivers of which I have spoken we have many examples besides that of oil,\r\nand also proofs that they traverse great distances, as, for instance, in\r\nthe case of the Saratoga Springs. It is clearly demonstrated that in the\r\ncase of these and other springs the waters must come from various\r\nsources, and pass through many varieties of minerals before they arrive\r\nat their destination, and thus receive the combination of elements which\r\nimpart to them their medicinal qualities. Then there are numerous\r\ninstances of this remarkable power of water in the case of these\r\nmonstrous land slides in mountainous regions, such as the Alps. In the\r\nact of attempting to find its level, too, water sometimes exerts its\r\ninfluence, in breaking up rocks, equal in its manifestation to a\r\npowerful explosive. Thus we see the great influences that are at work\r\neverywhere capable of producing earthquakes without the necessity of\r\nresorting to the volcanic theory and without the aid of fire.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of this theory of earthquakes, let us suppose\r\nthat one of these immense oil lakes which must exist in the bowels of\r\nthe earth should be situated beneath a mountain, where it has been\r\nundisturbed for ages, but through some recent disturbing cause—most\r\nlikely that of excavating, to which I have referred—it begins to find an\r\noutlet through various fissures. When once started, this great mass of\r\nfluid matter begins to go with a rush, forcing innumerable outlets,\r\nuntil the internal lake is in a measure exhausted. This creates an\r\nimmense vacuum, which deprives the mountain of a large portion of its\r\nsupport; hence there is a settling down of several inches or several\r\nfeet, according to the nature and the solidity of the support. It is\r\nthis process of settling down and the struggle of the large masses of\r\nfluid to force their way out, that create the rumbling noise resembling\r\nthat of distant thunder, and which also cause the tremulous and\r\nquivering motion felt at the surface of the earth, and still more\r\ndistinctly in the houses, and most distinctly of all in the upper\r\nstories thereof. These effects may be produced at a great distance from\r\nthe original cause of action, varying, of course, in their intensity\r\naccording to that distance. Several of these effects have been\r\ndistinctly experienced in Charleston since the first great catastrophe,\r\nbut showing that the cause is weaker and further removed from the scene\r\nof the disaster than it was during the first fearful shock.\r\n\r\nThe Charleston earthquake did not strike Wall Street with very great\r\nforce. The very fact of its weak effect upon the great financial centre\r\nof gravity created about as much surprise in the Street as the frightful\r\nshock itself did in a very different and opposite manner upon the people\r\nof Charleston. The reason that the great catastrophe which overwhelmed\r\nCharleston had so little effect on Wall Street was chiefly owing to the\r\nfact that comparatively little loss fell upon the corporations or the\r\npeople connected with Wall Street interests. The loss of ten millions\r\nfell mainly upon the people of the doomed city alone. Only a small\r\nportion fell upon people located elsewhere either in the North or the\r\nSouth. Had such a disaster happened in any of the large cities North,\r\nEast or West, owing to their intertwining connections with Wall Street,\r\na panic would have been the result not unlike the one which followed the\r\nChicago fire.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are likely to become the great disasters of the future most\r\nto be dreaded. Our population now comprises sixty millions, which, at\r\nthe present rate of increase, will soon reach one hundred millions.\r\nAmong these is a large proportion of go-ahead, driving men, who are\r\nconstantly diving into the bowels of the earth to dig up the vast\r\ntreasures which are there concealed. Through this laudable enterprise\r\nthe underpinning of the surface of our globe is being constantly\r\ndisturbed; and though it is far from a consoling reflection, the time\r\nmay come, and may not be far distant, when such calamities as that of\r\nCharleston may be as common as railroad accidents are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _August Belmont_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n                AUGUST BELMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ROTHSCHILDS.—BEGINS LIFE IN THE\r\n    ROTHSCHILDS’ HOUSE IN FRANKFORT.—CONSUL GENERAL TO AUSTRIA AND\r\n    MINISTER TO THE HAGUE.—A GREAT FINANCIER AND A CONNOISSEUR IN ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust Belmont has achieved the highest credit of any banker in the\r\nUnited States. His bills are always in demand and command a little more\r\nthan those of any one else. He came to New York comparatively poor, but\r\nis now worth millions. As a representative of the Rothschilds in this\r\ncountry he has for many years held a high position in the financial\r\nworld. He has managed the business of that historic house with prudence\r\nand exceptional acuteness and sagacity. Contrast his success in this\r\ncountry with the experience of Americans abroad. George Peabody, and J.\r\nS. Morgan, the successor of that philanthropist, may seem to be\r\nexceptions to the rule, but they did not win such social and business\r\nsuccess as has been achieved by Mr. Belmont in this country, and the\r\nfact remains that no American could have been so successful abroad as he\r\nhas been in the United States. Europe does not afford the opportunities\r\nthat so often arise here. This is the country of great and frequent\r\nopportunities; there is a large and inviting field for enterprise and\r\nbusiness skill, although, of course, all cannot win such a position in\r\nthe financial world as that occupied by Mr. Belmont, who is reckoned\r\namong the wealthiest as well as the most honored of America’s adopted\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the Rhenish Palatinate sixty-eight years ago. His father\r\nwas a man in well-to-do circumstances, who sent him, when he was\r\nthirteen years old, to become an apprenticed clerk to the Rothschilds in\r\ntheir Frankfort house. According to the German custom, he received no\r\npay; he was compensated by the opportunity of learning the banking\r\nbusiness. He made rapid progress. Before he was twenty-one he was\r\nselected to accompany one of the Rothschilds to Italy and France as his\r\nsecretary. In 1837 the famous house, recognizing the promising field in\r\nthis country for profitable investments, sent young Belmont to New York\r\nas their agent, a position which he held till 1858, when he became their\r\nAmerican correspondent and general representative, and this responsible\r\npost he has held ever since. In 1844 he was appointed Consul-General for\r\nAustria, and held the position for five years, when he relinquished it\r\nbecause of his personal friendship for Louis Kossuth and his sympathy\r\nwith Hungary in the quarrel with Austria. In 1849 Mr. Belmont married\r\nthe niece of Commodore Perry, the hero of Lake Erie, a beautiful and\r\naccomplished lady, who did much to strengthen his social position. In\r\n1853 he was appointed Minister to the Hague by President Pierce, and\r\nserved four years. He has always been a staunch Democrat, and was for\r\nseveral years chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He has\r\ngenerally refused to accept public office, but his eldest son, Perry,\r\nhas served several terms in Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Belmont is under the medium height, rather stout, with iron-gray\r\nside whiskers, round German features and keen dark eyes, and among the\r\nstrong characteristics of the man is his marked chivalric courtesy and\r\nknightly courage. As a financier he has few equals and no superior, and\r\nto his politic and conservative management, as well as his foresight and\r\nintimate knowledge of affairs, is due the American prestige and success\r\nof the Rothschilds. Mr. Belmont’s house on Fifth Avenue, with its\r\nsplendid art treasures, is worth a large fortune in itself. He is a\r\nconnoisseur in works of art, and has one of the finest private\r\ncollections of pictures in the world. For many years he has also had a\r\nprincely residence at Newport and a stock farm at Babylon, Long Island.\r\nThough not, strictly speaking, a club man, he was one of the founders of\r\nthe Manhattan Club. His successful career is an illustration of the fact\r\nthat this country affords a fine opportunity for the intelligence,\r\nthrift and industry not only of native Americans but of the Republic’s\r\nadopted citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n   THE SOCIALIST OBJECTIONS TO THE PRESENT ORDER OF\r\n                        SOCIETY EXAMINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF POPULATION AND THE GROWING PRESSURE UPON THE MEANS OF\r\n    SUBSISTENCE.—EDUCATION AND MORAL IMPROVEMENT THE TRUE REMEDY FOR\r\n    EXISTING OR THREATENED EVILS.—ERRORS OF COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM.—HOW\r\n    SOCIALISTIC LEADERS AND PHILOSOPHERS RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH.—GROWTH OF\r\n    POPULATION DOES NOT MEAN POVERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mill says: “It is impossible to deny that the considerations brought\r\nto notice in the preceding chapter make out a frightful case either\r\nagainst the existing order of society or against the position of man\r\nhimself in this world.” How much of the evils should be referred to the\r\none, and how much to the other, is the principal theoretic question\r\nwhich has to be resolved. But the strongest case is susceptible of\r\nexaggeration; and it will be evident to many readers, even from the\r\npassages I have quoted, that such exaggeration is not wanting in the\r\nrepresentations of the ablest and most candid Socialists. Though much of\r\ntheir allegations is unanswerable, not a little is the result of errors\r\nin political economy; by which, let me say once for all, I do not mean\r\nthe rejection of any practical rules of policy which have been laid down\r\nby political economists—I mean ignorance of economic facts, and of the\r\ncauses by which the economic phenomena of society as it is are actually\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is unhappily true that the wages of ordinary\r\nlabor, in all the countries of Europe, are wretchedly insufficient to\r\nsupply the physical and moral necessities of the population in any\r\ntolerable measure. But, when it is further alleged that even this\r\ninsufficient remuneration has a tendency to diminish; that there is, in\r\nthe words of M. Louis Blanc, _une basse continue des salaires_ (a\r\ncontinual decline of wages); the assertion is in opposition to all\r\naccurate information, and to many notorious facts. It has yet to be\r\nproven that there is any country in the civilized world where the\r\nordinary wages of labor, estimated either in money or in articles of\r\nconsumption, are declining; while in many they are, on the whole, on the\r\nincrease—and an increase which is becoming, not slower, but more rapid.\r\nThere are, occasionally, branches of industry which are being gradually\r\nsuperseded by something else, and in those, until production\r\naccommodates itself to demand, wages are depressed; which is an evil,\r\nbut a temporary one, and would admit of great alleviation even in the\r\npresent system of social economy. A diminution thus produced of the\r\nreward of labor in some particular employment is the effect and the\r\nevidence of increased remuneration, or of a new source of remuneration,\r\nin some other; the total and the average remuneration being\r\nundiminished, or even increased. To make out an appearance of diminution\r\nin the rate of wages in any leading branch of industry, it is always\r\nfound necessary to compare some month or year of special and temporary\r\ndepression at the present time, with the average rate, or even some\r\nexceptionally high rate, at an earlier time. The vicissitudes are no\r\ndoubt a great evil, but they were as frequent and as severe in their\r\nformer periods of economical history as now. The greater scale of the\r\ntransactions, and the greater number of persons involved in each\r\nfluctuation, may make the change appear greater, but though a large\r\npopulation affords more sufferers, the evil does not weigh heavier on\r\neach of them individually. There is much evidence of improvement, and\r\nnone that is at all trustworthy, of deterioration, in the mode of living\r\nof the laboring population of the countries of Europe. When there is any\r\nappearance to the contrary it is local or partial, and can always be\r\ntraced either to the pressure of some temporary calamity, or to some bad\r\nlaw or unwise act of government which admits of being corrected, while\r\nthe permanent causes all operate in the direction of improvement.\r\n\r\nM. Louis Blanc, therefore, while showing himself much more enlightened\r\nthan the old school of levellers and democrats—inasmuch as he recognizes\r\nthe connection between low wages and the over-rapid increase of\r\npopulation—appears to have fallen into the same error which was at first\r\ncommitted by Malthus and his followers, that of supposing that because\r\npopulation has a greater power of increase than subsistence, its\r\npressure upon subsistence must be always growing more severe. The\r\ndifference is that the early Malthusians thought this an irrepressible\r\ntendency, while M. Louis Blanc thinks that it can be repressed, but only\r\nthrough a system of Communism. It is a great point gained for truth when\r\nit is recognized that the tendency to over-population is a fact which\r\nCommunism, as well as the existing order of society, would have to deal\r\nwith. And it is encouraging that this necessity is admitted by the more\r\nconsiderable chiefs of all existing schools of Socialism. Owen and\r\nFourier, as well as M. Louis Blanc, admitted it, and claimed for their\r\nrespective systems a pre-eminent power of dealing with this difficulty.\r\nHowever this may be, experience shows that in the existing state of\r\nsociety the pressure of population on subsistence, which is the\r\nprincipal cause of low wages, though a great is not an increasing evil;\r\non the contrary, the progress of all that is called civilization has a\r\ntendency to diminish it, partly by the more rapid increase of the means\r\nof employing and maintaining labor, partly by the increased facilities\r\nopened to labor for transporting itself to new countries and unoccupied\r\nfields of employment, and partly by a general improvement in the\r\nintelligence and prudence of the population. This progress, no doubt, is\r\nslow; but it is much that such progress should take place at all, while\r\nwe are still only in the first stage of that public movement for the\r\neducation of the whole people which, when more advanced, must add\r\ngreatly to the force of the two causes of improvement specified above.\r\nIt is, of course, open to discussion what form of society has the\r\ngreatest power of dealing successfully with the pressure of population\r\non subsistence, and on this question there is much to be said for\r\nSocialism; what was long thought to be its weakest point will, perhaps,\r\nprove to be one of its strongest. But it has no just claim to be\r\nconsidered as the sole means of preventing the general and growing\r\ndegradation of the mass of mankind through the peculiar tendency of\r\npoverty to produce over-population. Society as at present constituted is\r\nnot descending into that abyss, but gradually, though slowly, rising out\r\nof it, and this improvement is likely to be progressive if bad laws do\r\nnot interfere with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n          STOCK EXCHANGE CELEBRITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WALL STREET BANKERS’ NERVES ARE TRIED.—FINE HUMOR, JOCULAR\r\n    DISPOSITIONS, AND SCHOLARLY TASTE OF OPERATORS.—GEORGE GOULD AS A\r\n    FUTURE FINANCIAL POWER.—AMERICAN NOBILITY COMPARED WITH EUROPEAN\r\n    ARISTOCRACY.—HOW THE IRISH CAN ASSIST TO PURGE GREAT BRITAIN OF HER\r\n    BILIOUS INCUBUS OF NOBILITY.—THE NATURAL NOBILITY OF OUR OWN\r\n    COUNTRY, AND THEIR DESTINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the well-known members of the Stock Exchange not elsewhere\r\nmentioned are James D. Smith, who is now in his second term as\r\nPresident, and who is also President of the New York and Exchange clubs\r\nand Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, a man of a genial nature and\r\neveryone’s friend; Brayton Ives, twice President of the Stock Exchange,\r\nthe colonel of a cavalry regiment under General Sheridan in the civil\r\nwar, and later a Brevet-Brigadier General; a graduate of Yale, and a\r\nmember of the Union League, Century, Athletic and University clubs;\r\nCharles Johnes, the King of board room traders, once a clerk for Henry\r\nClews & Co., now worth a million, and a Prince of good fellows, as\r\nbright and quick as he is popular; Louis Bell, a daring and successful\r\noperator, a son of the well-known Isaac Bell, and who was at one time a\r\nclerk with Brown Brothers & Co., the bankers; John Kirkner, another\r\nplucky operator, keen in forecasting the market, and tenacious of his\r\nopinions, whether contrary to generally accepted views or not; Eugene\r\nBogert, Wm. B. Wadsworth, William Henriques and James Raymond, also\r\nsuccessful traders; John Slayback, Edward Brandon, James Mitchell,\r\nVice-Chairman Alexander Henriques, ex-President J. Edward Simmons,\r\nSecretary Geo. W. Ely, Donald Mackay, Thomas B. Musgrave, Frank Work,\r\nthe Wormsers, R. P. Flower, John T. Lester, Frank Savin, Charles\r\nSchwartz and A. E. Bateman, are all worthy of special notice. Some of\r\nthe foregoing have a large following, more particularly the large room\r\ntraders, like Messrs. Johnes, Bell, Bogert, Kirkner and Wadsworth. There\r\nare eleven hundred members of the Stock Exchange, and it is seldom that\r\na black sheep is discovered among them. There are some lambs, perhaps,\r\nwho receive a spring and fall shearing, but if they have pluck the wool\r\ncomes back again, and they push up the thorny and brambly path to\r\nwealth, leaving, it is true, a little fleece here and there in the\r\nstruggle, but generally “getting there,” nevertheless. It is, however, a\r\nmistake to suppose that all the members of the Stock Exchange are\r\nwealthy. They have their ups and downs like everybody else, and some are\r\nin very moderate circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe strain on a Wall Street broker is so great, the tension of the\r\nnerves, in one of the most trying vocations known in the business world,\r\nis so severe, that joking and in fact boyish pranks constitute a safety\r\nvalve for the relief of brains that would otherwise become disordered.\r\nWithout the relief of joking and skylarking, Nature’s own remedy for the\r\nburdened mind in such circumstances—many a stock broker would go mad.\r\n“There is nothing so good as a laugh,” says the song, and this expresses\r\na profounder truth than is generally suspected. Charles Darwin relaxed\r\nthe severe mental strain induced by his inquiries into occult questions\r\nof biological science by reading the humorous extravagances of Mark\r\nTwain, and the greatest thinkers, men who are far out on the cold\r\nfrontiers of thought, seeking, as intellectual pioneers, the solution of\r\nthe fundamental problem of existence, are proverbially jocular in their\r\nhours of relaxation. Nature herself may be said to laugh, and why not\r\noverburdened business men? The pranks at Christmas on the Stock\r\nExchange, the sound of hand organs in the Board Room, the smashing of\r\nhats, pushing and jostling, the blowing of tin horns, the waltzes and\r\nlanciers, the walking matches, wrestling and sparring—these are only the\r\nnatural reaction through the safety valve of humor which tend to relieve\r\nundue tension and keep the spirits clear and fresh. There is more or\r\nless skylarking on all dull days, and the effect is mental invigoration.\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that only the younger men participate in\r\nthese amusements. The older members are the most incorrigible. When a\r\nnew member, for instance, is receiving his vigorous initiation and being\r\nhustled here and there like a chip in raging waters, his silk hat\r\nskimming along the floor, the foot ball of hundreds of feet, his collar\r\nat right angles with his person and his coat tails flying like a Dutch\r\nlugger under full sail, a group of older members may look on with\r\napparent disapproval, but the moment the newcomer is driven in their\r\ndirection he finds that his last state is worse than the first. The\r\nveterans give him a reception that makes him look wilder and gasp more\r\nthan ever, and he is glad to escape from these gray bearded evil-doers.\r\nThe horse play is rough but it does no harm, and the new member, after\r\nbuying a new hat, is ready to “get square” on the next unfortunate wight\r\nto be initiated.\r\n\r\nAs to the Stock Exchange as a great financial institution, none stands\r\nhigher in the world. Its transactions involve hundreds of millions in a\r\nyear, and nowhere is there more regard for strict equity in business.\r\nIts members are as exemplary a class of business men as can be found\r\nanywhere. Its methods are strictly upright, and a black sheep finds no\r\nmercy. Wealth will not necessarily procure a membership in this great\r\nfinancial emporium. The applicant must be a person of good repute. It\r\nnumbers men of great wealth, men of a high order of talent, men of\r\nscholarly tastes, connoisseurs in art, students of science, literature\r\nand philosophy, and men capable of standing at the helm and giving\r\ndirection to vast enterprises in the domain of finance and commerce.\r\nThere is not a more intelligent body of men in the world. The very\r\nnature of their business compels them to study great public questions,\r\nand many of the members are men of a distinctly statesmanlike caste of\r\nmind, of whom the Stock Exchange may well be proud, while they\r\nthemselves derive no small distinction from being identified with so\r\nillustrious and honorable a body.\r\n\r\n                         WASHINGTON E. CONNOR.\r\n\r\nWashington E. Connor was born in New York city about 37 years ago. He\r\nfirst appeared in Wall Street as a clerk for Wm. Belden & Co., a firm in\r\nwhich the redoubtable Jim Fisk was once a partner. Black Friday of\r\nSeptember, 1869, when a financial hurricane whistled through Wall\r\nStreet, brought young Connor to the front, and he has ever since\r\nremained there. He was long the able lieutenant of Mr. Gould in large\r\nspeculations. He is a natural leader in speculation—cool, quick and\r\nadroit. From time to time he has been a director in the Western Union,\r\nUnion Pacific, Missouri Pacific, Missouri, Kansas & Texas, Kansas\r\nPacific and Wabash Companies. He was president of the Central\r\nConstruction Company, which established the lines of the American Union\r\nTelegraph Company. He was a director in the famous Credit Mobilier\r\nCompany, the Texas & Colorado Improvement Company, the Metropolitan and\r\nNew York Elevated roads and the New Jersey Southern. He is a member of\r\nthe Union League and the Lotus clubs, and especially enjoys the society\r\nof artists, writers and other persons of talent and cultivation. He has\r\na good library, and is of a somewhat studious turn of mind. As a youth\r\nhe studied at the College of the City of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _George J. Gould_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A FUTURE FINANCIAL POWER.\r\n\r\nGeorge J. Gould will be one of the few very rich men in this country, as\r\nhe will, of course, be his father’s successor. He possesses good\r\nabilities, has an attractive presence, and is modest and retiring in his\r\nmanners. He has, thus far, made an excellent record, and the Stock\r\nExchange was glad to admit him to membership. He is connected with all\r\nof his father’s roads, and is gradually relieving him of much of the\r\nonerous work connected therewith. If anything should happen to Jay\r\nGould, George Gould would stand in the same financial relation to his\r\naffairs that Wm. H. Vanderbilt sustained to his father, the Commodore,\r\nand, like him, would be found equal to the new honors and\r\nresponsibilities devolving upon him. This reasonable expectation should\r\ndispel any apprehension of a financial shock in the event of Jay Gould’s\r\ndemise.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gould is bright and agreeable, and a good husband. If Jay Gould\r\nhas made enemies, that is no reason why his son should not be popular.\r\nIt is proverbial that the male descendants of a family are more akin to\r\nthe side of the mother than to that of the father, and as Mrs. Jay Gould\r\nhas always been recognized as a most exemplary wife and mother, she may\r\nrightfully be regarded as the equal of any woman in New York, and one to\r\nbe respected and honored accordingly by those whom we ought to take as\r\nsocial exemplars. There should be no other standard of social test than\r\nthat of merit; not judging individuals by what they were, but by what\r\nthey are to-day; not judging by the ridiculous test of ancestry—a\r\ncriterion which would upset some of our social demi-gods—but by the real\r\nworth of the living man or woman. Suppose, for instance, the young\r\nVanderbilts, who rank high in society, and are splendid specimens of\r\nnature’s noblemen, should be measured by the standard of the old\r\nCommodore when he was a boatman on Staten Island. Everybody would\r\nrecognize such a test of fitness as to the last degree absurd. In the\r\nUnited States nature’s nobility is at the front, as against the\r\nparchment nobility of England and the Continent. The _personelle_ of the\r\nEnglish nobility makes a sorry showing beside that of young George\r\nGould, the young Vanderbilts, and others of our wealthy Americans.\r\n\r\nThe modern nobility spring from success in business. Peace has its\r\nvictories in the formation of character greater than those of war; and\r\npeace and republicanism will develop the future greatness of the human\r\nfamily, and not pretentious yet effete monarchies, of which mankind is\r\nheartily sick. Many of the so-called noblemen of to-day shine only by a\r\nfaint reflected glimmer from the armor of mediæval ancestors; or their\r\nancestry may be much more recent, and steal slyly off in the gloom of\r\nforgotten crimes to the prison or the gallows; or their patent of\r\nnobility may be a thing of yesterday, a child’s bauble solemnly\r\ndisplayed by addle-pated dotards, ridiculous even to the unthinking. The\r\nEnglish nobility is coming to the auction block. Not a few in former\r\ntimes laid their heads there for treason, but now it is articles of more\r\nvalue, namely, the curious, the antiquities, the bric-a-brac, the works\r\nof art, the rare furniture, which comes to the block, and they are\r\npurchased by the new nobility raised up by success in finance and\r\ncommerce. There is very little in Europe which is not obtainable at a\r\nprice. Titles in England may yet be sold as they have been in Italy. Who\r\ncares for a title of Italian or French nobility? To this low estate must\r\nEnglish titles come at last. It is marvellous that they have endured so\r\nmany centuries after the downfall of the feudal system that originally\r\ngave them birth.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Gladstone has always refused a title?\r\n\r\nOne reason is that at his birth nature gave him a higher title to\r\nnobility than parchment can ever confer.\r\n\r\nAnother is that he did not care to be ennobled and then wrapped, as a\r\ntitled mummy, in the sweet-scented cerements of political death, to be\r\nburied in that Egyptian tomb of political extinction, the House of\r\nLords. And to-day he is a Colossus among statesmen, whose grand figure\r\nwill loom up in history as one of the foremost men of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, a Titan dwarfing the proudest of a senile nobility. And yet he\r\nis simply a great Commoner.\r\n\r\nIf the Irish wish to assist nature in purging Great Britain of her\r\nbilious incumbus of nobility, they should recognize the fact that\r\nridicule is a good medicine. The Irish are proverbially prolific. Let\r\nthem make a point of christening the rising generation with titled\r\nnames. Then there would be myriads bearing the name of Duke O’Reilly,\r\nEarl McCarty, Marquis O’Brien, Baron Sullivan, Sir Timothy Finnegan,\r\nLord McSwynny, and so on. The objection to this plan, however, is that\r\nit would brand thousands of innocent and helpless children of worthy\r\nparents with titles which have become contemptible to all right-thinking\r\npersons as the badges of imbecility, mediocrity, or dishonor. This is a\r\nrather lengthy digression after beginning with one of the natural\r\nnobility which we have in this country, namely, the nobility founded\r\nsolely on merit, but the case of a young man like George Gould naturally\r\nsuggests contrasts. He is destined to take a commanding position in the\r\nworld of finance in future years, and it is gratifying to know that he\r\nis a man of high character, excellent capacity, and of great promise.\r\nThere is usually a disposition to criticise the sons of very wealthy\r\nmen, due to that envy to which poor human nature is so prone, but the\r\nfact in this case is indisputable that young Gould is held in high\r\nesteem wherever he is known. He is a graduate of Harvard and Columbia,\r\nand a member of the Manhattan and other clubs, and he is, in the\r\nbusiness world, where he is most powerful, simply a reserved and quiet\r\nassociate, always controlling his lines, but never interfering in a\r\nstrident way with those who are working for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n            A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WE ARE.—WHAT WE ARE PREPARING FOR.—WHAT WE ARE DESTINED TO DO AND\r\n    TO BECOME.—WE ARE ENTERING ON AN ERA OF SEEMING IMPOSSIBILITIES.—YET\r\n    THE INCONCEIVABLE WILL BE REALIZED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the past, I am struck with the enormous growth of New York\r\nas a city, New York as a State, and the United States as a Nation. The\r\nfact is that we hustle through the business world so fast (and this is\r\nespecially applicable to Wall Street), that we do not realize how\r\nrapidly we are going. To any one who is familiar with the appearance of\r\nthe down town or business part of the city, as it was twenty years ago,\r\nten years ago, or even eight years ago, the difference to-day will give\r\nsome intimation of the changes which are going on around us, and are\r\nmerely features of development. Why, even ten years ago, the old\r\nEquitable Building was a structure to which attention was attracted\r\nbecause of its greatness and its superiority over any other building in\r\nNew York city—its height, its width, its breadth, its depth, its\r\nelevators, its beauty of arrangement inside and its artistic aspect\r\noutside. Millions of dollars have been spent in the past few months in\r\nmaking this one building about four times as large as the original\r\nstructure which brought pride to the hearts of New Yorkers, and\r\nsurprised and startled their friends from the country. To-day it is one\r\nof the greatest buildings on the Island, and even rivals the State\r\nCapitol, which is supposed to be the pride of the people of the Empire\r\nState. This is only one instance. All along lower Broadway, the great\r\nbusiness artery of the country, four-story and five-story buildings have\r\nbeen torn down, and nine-story buildings put up in their place. Four and\r\nfive buildings have been dug away and a single structure put up in their\r\nplace, and in some of the buildings—indeed in scores of them—within a\r\nfew blocks of the Stock Exchange, there are whole communities of people\r\nwho are performing life’s work in their own good way, rather than\r\ninterfering with their neighbors or themselves, and who know nothing of\r\nwhat goes on around and about them, and care less. Small armies of\r\nretainers and servants, and the most perfect mechanism, are needed to\r\nenable these communities to carry on their work with dispatch and\r\nconvenience. That is to say, where offices are rented in the eighth and\r\nninth stories of a building, the occupants expect to be shot up to them,\r\nand down from them, with no trouble to themselves, and no weariness of\r\nlimbs—and they are. This must be done, too, without loss of time—and it\r\nis. All the attendant arrangements must have the elements of\r\nluxuriousness and comfort—and they do.\r\n\r\nThis is a small feature of our development, however. So far as the\r\ndevelopment of the city is concerned, this appears to be an era of\r\nbridges, and Rapid Transit Elevated roads. So far as the development of\r\ninter-State communication is concerned this is an era of Express Trains,\r\nwhich, although they have reached a speed of a mile a minute in certain\r\nperfected sections of the roads, do not at all indicate what will come\r\nto pass in the future. Electricity is, of course, the means for\r\ninstantaneous communication between separate points known to human\r\nintelligence, practically annihilating time between the New World and\r\nthe Old World, and between separated points in either world, or even in\r\nthe cities. But electricity does not travel with anything like the speed\r\nof light and air. Now, in some few instances, we have utilized\r\ncompressed air as a means of locomotion. Efforts are being made, but are\r\nstill in a crude state of development, for the utilization of\r\nelectricity as a motive power. Suppose we look one handled years ahead,\r\nand, calculating upon the factors and experiences of the past one\r\nhundred years, imagine what the picture will be of this town as a city,\r\nand this people as a nation. I believe that one hundred years hence the\r\nera of bridges between this city and those which adjoin it across the\r\nrivers, will have passed away, and that instead of one or two or five\r\nbridges across the East River, we will have pneumatic tubes at every\r\npier, and I believe the same will be true on either side and at the end\r\nof the island. These tubes will spread from New York, as the blood\r\nvessels in the human body spread out and are supplied from the heart;\r\nfor New York is not only the business heart of this country, but it is\r\ndestined to be, so surely as God permits growth, the business heart of\r\nthe world, and the money centre of the world. And the arteries from this\r\ncentre will distribute the blood all over, and in all directions.\r\nThrough these pneumatic tubes I believe there will be almost\r\ninstantaneous communication or transportation of people from one point\r\nto another. Nor will this be confined to New York city alone. In the\r\nnear future the Trunk Line Railroad to leading points, such as\r\nWashington, Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago, will probably run trains\r\nat the rate of one hundred miles an hour, and even this will only be a\r\nbeginning. To admit of this, steel rails will be required of about\r\ndouble their present weight, and the wheels must be proportionately\r\nmassive and strong. The risk attendant upon such increased speed will be\r\nno greater than the ordinary speed of the present day, say forty miles\r\nan hour. But the time will come, during the next five generations, when\r\nthe pneumatic tubes will extend from here to these central points of the\r\nEast and the West and the South; and it will be possible for a man to\r\nleave New York at seven o’clock and go to Chicago for breakfast,\r\ntransact his business and return to New York for lunch or business\r\nappointment by twelve o’clock noon of the same day. Of course, one of\r\nthe problems to be solved in connection with this sort of meteoric speed\r\nwill be to supply air for breathing purposes; and the same compressed\r\nair which will shoot the carriage through the tube, will be in some form\r\nutilized for the purpose. This, however, only for a period; for I think\r\nthe time must come when electricity will be the one motive power of this\r\ncountry and of the world, so far as the transportation of people and\r\nproperty is concerned. Time is money, and the American idea is to save\r\ntime. We now waste little enough of it in all conscience. The greatest\r\nbusiness of the world, that of the New York Stock Exchange, is already\r\ncompressed into five hours’ time; and yet it is a business in which the\r\nmost trivial error or accident because of haste might cause losses of\r\nmillions. The obliteration of time is a necessity of American\r\nenterprise. When Electricity is made the general propelling power, it is\r\nlikely that a stationary engine will be located at Niagara Falls, and\r\nthe force and power of those waters utilized to supply all the needed\r\npropelling power for this State, if not even beyond, to remote and\r\nfar-off sections of our country. I heard it once said by an intelligent\r\nauthority, that it had been predicted that instead of the coal mines of\r\nthis country sending their products hundreds and thousands of miles\r\naway, for transportation-power, at a great expense, that a stationary\r\nengine would be located at the mouth of the mine, and the power derived\r\nfrom the coal transmitted therefrom over an electric wire. This would,\r\nindeed, be a great transformation, and a great improvement and a great\r\neconomy. But a greater change, one quite as likely in the future, and\r\nperhaps possible within the lifetime of some of our children, will be\r\nthe abolition of railroads by the pneumatic tube process, and the\r\ntransmission of power as I have suggested.\r\n\r\nA hundred years hence the people who then occupy our places will look\r\nupon us as primitive and crude, or, in accordance with the Darwinian\r\ntheory, as the monkeys from which their perfected race has been\r\ndeveloped. In fact, there is a good deal of Darwinism in our\r\ndevelopment, in a business sense, if not in a human sense. As the\r\nsurroundings grow, so does the intellect of the human race, and there is\r\nno telling what we may do or what we may become—provided we live long\r\nenough. We have plenty of room, plenty of power, plenty of natural\r\nability, and we make our own opportunities; all we lack in this world is\r\ntime and perfect science, and if time is given us we may be able to show\r\nwhat giants of enterprise a free people may become; that, as the first\r\nchoice of God’s creation, we lack nothing.\r\n\r\nWe are proud now of our Brooklyn Bridge. But when the Bridge was opened,\r\nand the foot passenger rate was made one cent per person, and the car\r\nrates three cents, it was a grave question of consideration for the men\r\nupon whom devolved the responsibility of the conduct of the Bridge,\r\nwhether or not the cities would supply passengers enough to make the\r\nBridge self-supporting. It was not expected that they could or would.\r\nBut to-day, the rate for foot passengers is one-fifth of one cent, and\r\nthe car passengers are transported for two and one-half cents. The time\r\nis not far distant when these rates will be made much less, if not\r\nabolished entirely. They certainly will be abolished so far as the\r\npromenade is concerned; and, at the rate of one cent per passenger now,\r\nthe Bridge would earn dividends for each of the two cities which issued\r\nbonds for its construction; while the taxable value of the property in\r\nboth has been so largely enhanced, that the Bridge has paid for itself\r\nalready, and, yet it has been open less than five years. More than a\r\nyear ago the experience of the Directors was that the facilities of this\r\nBridge were perfectly inadequate; and, while everything has been done to\r\nincrease them and extensions and improvements have been made, the Bridge\r\nis still too slow, and its power facilities too limited for the proper\r\naccommodation of the people who cross it from city to city.\r\n\r\nThis is only one evidence of the growth of New York; it is merely an\r\nincident. There is another incident, which, in connection with what I\r\nhave said about the difference in construction of buildings during the\r\npast few years, I think I will mention right here. The city of New York\r\ndonated to the Government the site in the City Hall Park where the New\r\nYork post-office now stands. It was the original intention that the\r\nbuilding should be only three stories in height. The capping was already\r\non, and the roof was in the primitive stages of construction, when,\r\nwalking down Broadway one morning, as I passed the structure, the\r\nthought occurred to me that, for a building of its size and heavy\r\ngranite exterior, its height was disproportionate, and gave it a dwarfed\r\nappearance, and a lack of symmetry. Besides that, whatever space could\r\nbe added to it by the increase in its height, even though the additional\r\nroom might be a surplus for the time being, the time would soon come\r\nwhen even more would be needed. I wrote to Architect Mullet, calling his\r\nattention to these facts, and insisting that, in confining the building\r\nto three stories, he was making a mistake; that it was not in keeping\r\nwith the magnificence of the structure; that it should have one or more\r\nadditional stories, with a mansard addition besides, and that the\r\nbusiness experience of the past most certainly demonstrated that the\r\nroom would soon be needed by the Government for the proper conduct of\r\nits affairs in this the greatest business center of the country. Within\r\na week Mr. Mullet called to see me, and I convinced him that I was\r\ncorrect in my criticism and predictions. He said, in reply: “But there\r\nis no appropriation; the money appropriated is exhausted, and the\r\nbuilding cannot be enlarged.” I asked him: “Well, what is necessary to\r\nbe done in the matter? Suppose I write to Mr. Boutwell, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, about it, and urge that the building be enlarged as I\r\nsuggest.” Mr. Mullet approved of the suggestion, and I added: “I will\r\nwrite to several members of Congress to the same effect.” This I did,\r\nand it was not long afterward that Mr. Mullet informed me that my\r\nefforts in the matter had been successful, and he had received orders to\r\ngo ahead and make the building four stories in height, with a mansard\r\nroof story besides. This additional room was not needed at the time, but\r\nit has already become inadequate for the accommodation of the Government\r\npostal employees, and a few others who have been granted quarters there.\r\nAnd now there is a proposition under consideration for the construction\r\nof an additional Government building in this city which will cover two\r\nblocks of ground or more, and in which may be centered the various\r\ndepartments of Government, which are now scattered in a half dozen or\r\nmore places. Is not this evidence of growth? Is not this evidence of\r\ndevelopment which justifies what has been said as to our prospective\r\ngrowth? Yet this is merely incidental to the strides of progress going\r\non; and, if we are walking at this pace, will not our children’s\r\nchildren be racing at the different paces suggested by some of the\r\npredictions I have made?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Jay Gould_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n                  JAY GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION.—CLERK IN A COUNTRY STORE.—HE INVENTS A\r\n    MOUSE TRAP.—BECOMES A CIVIL ENGINEER AND SURVEYS DELAWARE\r\n    COUNTY.—WRITES A BOOK AND SELLS IT.—GETS A PARTNERSHIP IN A\r\n    PENNSYLVANIA TANNERY AND SOON BUYS HIS PARTNER OUT.—HE COMES TO NEW\r\n    YORK TO SELL HIS LEATHER, FALLS IN LOVE WITH A LEATHER MERCHANT’S\r\n    DAUGHTER AND MARRIES HER.—SETTLES IN THE METROPOLIS AND BEGINS TO\r\n    DEAL IN RAILROADS.—BUYS A BANKRUPT ROAD FROM HIS FATHER-IN-LAW,\r\n    REORGANIZES IT AND SELLS IT AT A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT.—HENCEFORTH HE\r\n    MAKES HIS MONEY DEALING IN RAILROADS.—HIS METHOD OF BUYING,\r\n    REORGANIZING AND SELLING OUT AT A LARGE PROFIT.—HOW HE MANAGED ERIE\r\n    IN CONNECTION WITH FISK AND DREW.—HIS OPERATIONS ON BLACK\r\n    FRIDAY.—CHECKMATED BY COMMODORE VANDERBILT AND OBLIGED TO SETTLE.—HE\r\n    MAKES MILLIONS OUT OF WABASH AND KANSAS & TEXAS.—HIS VENTURE IN\r\n    UNION PACIFIC.—HIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES.—ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN\r\n    UNION TELEGRAPH, AND HIS METHOD OF ABSORBING AND GETTING CONTROL OF\r\n    WESTERN UNION.—THE STRIKE OF THE TELEGRAPHERS AND HIS GREAT\r\n    ENCOUNTER WITH THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR AND TRADES UNIONISTS.—GOULD’S\r\n    FIRST YACHTING EXPEDITION.—AN EXCEEDINGLY HUMOROUS STORY OF HIS\r\n    EARLY EXPERIENCE ON THE WATER.—HIS STATUS AS A FACTOR IN RAILROAD\r\n    MANAGEMENT.—HIS ACQUISITION OF BALTIMORE & OHIO TELEGRAPH, &C.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens or Dumas, in the\r\nheight of the popularity of any of these great writers of fiction, had\r\nevolved from his inner consciousness a Jay Gould as the hero of a novel,\r\nits readers would have found serious fault with the author for\r\nattempting to transcend the rational probability allowed to the latitude\r\nof fiction. Few novel readers, in fact, would have patiently submitted\r\nto such a strain on their credulity prior to the era in the financial\r\ndevelopment of this country which produced some of the leading\r\ncharacters which Wall Street has brought to the front, as stern\r\nrealities of every day life, since my advent in the great arena of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nAmong these Jay Gould is conspicuous, and of all the self-made men of\r\nWall Street he had probably the most difficulty in making the first\r\nthousand dollars of the amazing pile which he now controls.\r\n\r\nJay Gould was born at Stratton Falls, Delaware county, New York, about\r\nthe year 1836. He was the son of John B. Gould, a farmer, who kept a\r\ngrocery store. At the age of sixteen young Gould became a clerk in a\r\nvariety store belonging to Squire Burnham, about two miles from the\r\nFalls. Here, in his leisure hours, he assiduously improved the little\r\nlearning he had received at the village school, by applying himself to\r\nthe study of book-keeping in the evenings.\r\n\r\nIt was when he was at this store, according to the most reliable\r\naccounts, that he manifested his natural aptitude for making sharp and\r\nprofitable bargains. His employer, the Squire, had his eye on a piece of\r\nland in Albany, which he expected to obtain cheap and so make a profit.\r\nHe whispered his intention to some friend in the store and his young\r\nassistant overheard him. When he went to put his design of purchasing\r\nthe land in execution he found that young Mr. Gould had been there\r\nbefore him, and had secured the title.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was a firm which had undertaken to survey the\r\ncounty and make office maps of it, and young Gould was employed to\r\nassist them. Having mastered the elementary principles of geometry, and\r\nbeing naturally quick and correct at figures, he soon became a fair\r\nexpert in common land surveying, and made himself exceedingly useful to\r\nhis employers. But the idea of not only being his own boss but an\r\nemployer of other people’s brains and muscles was one of his ruling\r\npropensities, and he used every effort to attain this object. In a short\r\ntime he bought out the firm, wrote a history of the county to accompany\r\nthe maps and peddled his book among the residents.\r\n\r\nThis natural inclination to buy out every concern with which he has been\r\nconnected has been the ruling passion of his life, and still tenaciously\r\nadheres to him. Prior to his negotiations with the firm of surveyors, he\r\nhad invented a mouse trap in his intervals of leisure in the store, and\r\nwith the proceeds of this and the bargain in the land, out of which he\r\nhad outwitted his employer, he was enabled to make himself master of the\r\nsituation with the surveyors. Shortly after this Gould became interested\r\nin a Pennsylvania tannery with Zadoc Pratt, who was the capitalist.\r\nThrough the advice of Israel Corse, the Commission Merchant of the firm,\r\nCol. Pratt proposed to dissolve the partnership. Gould induced Charles\r\nM. Leupp & Co. to purchase Pratt’s interest for $150,000. The business\r\ndid not meet the expectations of Leupp, who in a fit of despondency\r\ncommitted suicide. After his death Gould failed to retain possession of\r\nthe property, which was sold to H. D. H. Snyder, thus terminating Mr.\r\nGould’s career as a Pennsylvania tanner.\r\n\r\nOn his visits to New York Mr. Gould was attracted by the greater\r\nadvantages which the Empire City afforded for extending his business,\r\nand came here to reside. He had ingratiated himself in the favorable\r\nesteem of one of the grocery merchants with whom he had done business.\r\nThe merchant took him to his house to board and Mr. Gould fell in love\r\nwith his handsome daughter. It was a mutual affair of the heart, like\r\nthat of his son George and Miss Edith Kingdon, and a speedy marriage was\r\nthe result. The results of the happy union seem to have been all that\r\ncould be desired, and the domestic felicity of Mr. and Mrs. Gould, so\r\nfar as the public have been able to ascertain, has never suffered the\r\nslightest jar or interruption.\r\n\r\nThe father-in-law owned shares in a railroad which was in a bad\r\nfinancial condition. He employed his new son-in-law to see what he could\r\ndo to extricate him from a position in which he was likely to become\r\nembarrassed, and he wanted to sell his shares. Mr. Gould examined the\r\nroad, (with the locality of which he had been well acquainted in his\r\nboyhood,) saw the favorable possibilities of its future, under good\r\nmanagement, and instead of selling his father-in-law’s shares to a\r\nstranger, he took them at their market value himself, purchased more,\r\nfinally obtained control of the entire property, and sold it to a rival\r\ncompany at a large profit.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, was Mr. Gould’s first transaction in railroad matters,\r\nand from that day to this his great speculative forte has been buying\r\nand selling railroads. It was in that kind of business, and not in the\r\nstock market, as is popularly supposed, that he made the great bulk of\r\nhis enormous fortune.\r\n\r\nOn his entrance to Wall Street he began business alone. Afterwards he\r\nformed a partnership with Henry N. Smith and — Martin, the firm taking\r\nthe name of Smith, Gould & Martin. Martin is now in a lunatic asylum,\r\nand Henry N. Smith, who was the chief cause of the failure of Wm. Heath\r\n& Co. for a million dollars, is now a poor pensioner on the bounty of\r\nhis wife. But Mr. Gould still towers aloft, in the full enjoyment and\r\nthe continued progress of his speculative prosperity, without being\r\ndismayed by any competitor, however powerful, and overcoming all\r\nobstacles, no matter how gigantic.\r\n\r\nAs I have noticed pretty fully some of Mr. Gould’s greatest speculative\r\ntransactions, mostly behind the scenes in the chapter on Black Friday\r\nand also in the account of the “Commodore’s Corners,” it will be\r\nunnecessary to repeat them here.\r\n\r\nThere was one clever transaction in the Black Friday affair that should\r\nbe put on record to the credit of the able management of that great\r\ndeal. One prominent individual connected therewith was personally\r\nresponsible for $4,500,000. This was a pretty heavy load at that time\r\neven for him to carry, but it did not weigh very heavily upon him for\r\nany appreciable length of time. He adroitly managed to shift it over on\r\nto the shoulders of that broad-backed, soulless creature called the Erie\r\nCorporation, making it responsible by simply signing himself “T. R.,”\r\ninstead of “J.G.,” the large letters representing the ordinary\r\ncontraction “Tr.” for Treasurer. By this simple and ingenious device\r\nthis shrewd gentleman got rid of the burthensome legacy on the negative\r\nside, bequeathed to him by the “Black Friday corner.”\r\n\r\nThere is a story told, with several variations, in regard to a\r\nsensational interview between Mr. Gould and Commodore Vanderbilt. The\r\nscene is laid in the parlor of the Commodore’s house. It was about the\r\ntime that the latter was making desperate efforts to get a corner in\r\nErie, and at that particular juncture when, having been defeated in his\r\npurpose by the astute policy of the able triumvirate of Erie—Gould, Fisk\r\nand Drew—he had applied to the courts as a last resort to get even with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey had used the Erie paper mill to the best advantage, in turning out\r\nnew securities of Erie to supply the Vanderbilt brokers, who vainly\r\nimagined that they were getting a corner in the inexhaustible stock. Mr.\r\nVanderbilt was wild when he discovered the ruse and had no remedy but\r\nlaw against the perpetrators of this costly prank. These adroit\r\nfinanciers usually placed the law at defiance, or used it to their own\r\nadvantage, but this time they were so badly caught in their own net that\r\nthey had to fly from the State and take refuge at Taylor’s Hotel in\r\nJersey City.\r\n\r\nIt seems that during their temporary exile beyond the State Gould sought\r\na private interview one night with the Commodore, in the hope of\r\nbringing about conciliatory measures.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore conversed freely for some time, but in the midst of his\r\nconversation he seemed to be suddenly seized with a fainting spell, and\r\nrolled from his seat unto the carpet, where he lay motionless and\r\napparently breathless.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould’s first impulse was to go to the door and summon aid, but he\r\nfound it locked and no key in it. This increased his alarm and he became\r\ngreatly agitated. He shook the prostrate form of the Commodore, but the\r\nlatter was limp and motionless. Once there was a heavy sigh and a half\r\nsuffocated breathing, as if it were the last act of respiration.\r\nImmediately afterward the Commodore was still and remained in this\r\ncondition for nearly half an hour. Doubtless this was one of the most\r\nanxious half hours that ever Mr. Gould has experienced.\r\n\r\nIf I were permitted to indulge in the latitude of the ordinary story\r\nteller, I might here draw a harassing picture of Mr. Gould’s internal\r\nemotions, gloomy prospects in a criminal court and dark forebodings. His\r\nprolific brain would naturally be racked to find a plausible explanation\r\nin the event of the Commodore’s death, which had occurred while they\r\nwere the sole occupants of the room; and at that time, in the eyes of\r\nthe public, they were bitter enemies.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that, in the height of his anxiety, he would have been\r\nready to make very easy terms with his great rival, on condition of\r\nbeing relieved from his perilous position. It would have been a great\r\nopportunity, if such had been possible, for a third party to have come\r\nin as a physician, pronouncing it a case of heart disease. No doubt Mr.\r\nGould would have been willing to pay an enormous fee to be relieved of\r\nsuch an oppressive suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Commodore’s feint was evidently to try the courage and\r\nsoften the heart of Mr. Gould, who never seemed to suspect that it was a\r\nmere hoax. His presence of mind, however, was equal to the occasion, as\r\nhe bore the ordeal with fortitude until the practical joker was pleased\r\nto assume his normal condition and usual vivacity. If Mr. Gould had been\r\na man of common excitability he might have acted very foolishly under\r\nthese trying circumstances, and this doubtless would have pleased his\r\ntormentor intensely.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ of Mr. Gould, in the purchase and sale of\r\nrailroads, has been to buy up two or more bad roads, put them together,\r\ngive the united roads a new name, call it a good, prosperous line, with\r\nimmense prospects in the immediate future, get a great number of people\r\nto believe all this, then make large issues of bonds and sell them at a\r\ngood price, for the purpose of further improving and enhancing the value\r\nof the property. After these preliminaries had been gone through, if\r\nprofitable purchasers came along, they could have the road at a price\r\nthat would amply compensate Mr. Gould for all his labor and acute\r\nmanagement. If these purchasers should be unable to run the road\r\nprofitably and were obliged to go into liquidation after a year or two,\r\nas frequently happens, then Mr. Gould or his agents would very likely be\r\nfound on hand at the sale to take back the road at a greatly reduced\r\nprice. Mr. Gould would then get a fresh opportunity of showing the\r\nsuperiority of his management. He would be able to demonstrate that the\r\nroad had left his possession in excellent and progressive condition, but\r\nthrough loose management had been run down. He would then set about the\r\nwork of reorganization again and go through the same role substantially,\r\nwith slight variations, as before, realizing a handsome profit on each\r\nsuccessive reorganization.\r\n\r\nIt would take too much time, and swell this volume far beyond the space\r\nwhich I have laid out for it, to go minutely into the history of all Mr.\r\nGould’s great enterprises. In fact, it would take a large volume in\r\nitself to do justice to the various schemes which have been put under\r\nway by him directly and indirectly and carried to a successful issue\r\nduring his busy life of a quarter of a century in Wall Street. This\r\nseems a long time for a man who is still so young, although he is a\r\ngrandfather, and enjoying the use of his mental faculties more\r\nvigorously than ever.\r\n\r\nOwing to my own busy life I have only time to sketch the most salient\r\npoints of Mr. Gould’s prosperous career. Some future historian of Wall\r\nStreet is destined to make a big “spread” upon him, as the newspaper\r\nreporter would say. He will have ample material if he only begins his\r\nwork soon; but whoever undertakes the job should not forget the maxim of\r\nthat great veteran of literature, old Dr. Samuel Johnson, about material\r\nfor biography having a general tendency to become scarce, and, in some\r\ninstances, eventually to vanish. While the reliable material for Mr.\r\nGould’s biography may be subject to the common fate of growing less, as\r\ntime advances, there is no danger of utter oblivion in his case. He has\r\nimpressed his footprints on the sands of time too firmly for that.\r\n\r\nI don’t for a moment mean to insinuate the reason for this, which is\r\ngiven by Shakespeare as applicable to similar cases, although some\r\nill-natured and envious people might use the well-known quotation in\r\nthis connection:\r\n\r\n             “The evil that men do lives after them,\r\n              The good is often interred with their bones.”\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Gould will leave a large amount\r\nof good after him, and, indeed, it seems now as if the Shakespearian\r\nadage was to be reversed in his case. The evil that he may have done is\r\nlikely to be forgotten. He bids fair to outlive most of it, if he only\r\ngoes on to the end as he has been doing for the past few years. He is\r\nnow showing a decided disposition to become more of a builder up than a\r\nwrecker of values.\r\n\r\nThrough his great executive ability in railroad management and\r\nconstruction he has been instrumental in making many blades of grass\r\ngrow where none had grown before, causing the desert to blossom like the\r\nrose, assisting thousands who had formerly been poor and almost\r\ndestitute, pent up either in European hovels or New York tenement\r\nhouses, to find happy homes in the West and South. He has been a great\r\nfactor in improving the value of the land, and thus, while he was\r\nenriching himself, adding materially to the wealth and prestige of the\r\nnation and thereby elevating it in the appreciation of the world at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the London _Times_ recently sent over here to write\r\nup a description of the country, dwells emphatically on this\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Gould and other great millionaires and railroad\r\nmagnates, who contribute so largely to the general prosperity of which\r\nthey seem to be the indispensable mediums.\r\n\r\nIt was as the managing power in the Erie Railroad that Mr. Gould laid\r\nthe broad foundation of his fortune. His speculative connections with\r\nErie are more fully dealt with in the lives of Daniel Drew and Commodore\r\nVanderbilt. The money and influence which he gained, in connection with\r\nthe Erie corporation, enabled him to extend his operations in the\r\nacquisition of railroad property until, through Union Pacific and its\r\nvarious connections, Wabash and a number of Southwestern roads, it\r\nseemed probable, at one time, that he was in a fair way of grasping the\r\nentire control of the trans-continental business in railroad matters.\r\nAnd this was prior to the time when he obtained his present hold on\r\ntelegraph facilities.\r\n\r\nSome of the able schemes in which Mr. Gould has had credit for playing\r\nan important part, and sometimes a role that was considered rather\r\nreprehensible, were managed, so far as the outside business was\r\nconcerned, chiefly by one or more of his wicked partners. In one of the\r\nmost noteworthy of those projects, namely, the attempt to capture the\r\nAlbany & Susquehanna Railroad, Mr. Gould seldom or never appeared in\r\nperson before the public. His partner, James Fisk, Jr., was cast in that\r\nrole and played it with great ability. With the essential aid of those\r\ntwo shining lights of the New York bar, David Dudley Field and Thomas G.\r\nShearman, the Prince of Erie, (as Jim Fisk was called,) came pretty near\r\nsnatching possession of 142 miles of a very important railroad, with the\r\ncontrol of only 6,500 out of 30,000 shares of the stock, and 3,000\r\nshares of these 6,500 had been illegally obtained, as was eventually\r\ndecreed by the court.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisk, though the silent member of the Erie firm, had also control of\r\nJudge Barnard, of the Supreme Court of the City and County of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Albany & Susquehanna road would have been a valuable prize for Erie.\r\nIt runs from the eastern extremity of the New York Central at Albany to\r\na junction with Erie at Binghamton. At that time Erie aspired to be a\r\nsuccessful competitor with Central for New England business, and had\r\ndetermined to monopolize the coal trade between that section and\r\nPennsylvania. This connecting link of 142 miles was therefore regarded\r\nas a very valuable acquisition by both the large roads. Hence it was\r\nworth a desperate effort, and Jim Fisk showed that he had a true\r\nappreciation of its value, for he organized a company of New York\r\nroughs, placed himself at their head, and being armed with bludgeons and\r\npistols and an injunction from Judge Barnard, obtained from him in New\r\nYork city—while he was really in Poughkeepsie at the time—went to Albany\r\nand took forcible possession of the offices of the railroad. He had the\r\nPresident, Secretary, counsel and receiver of the road arrested and put\r\nunder $25,000 bonds each. Mr. Fisk went through the farce of an election\r\nof Erie candidates for the offices which he had forcibly made vacant in\r\nthe Albany & Susquehanna, bringing his roughs up to vote as\r\nstockholders.\r\n\r\nThe President of the road, Mr. Joseph H. Ramsey, fought stoutly for his\r\nrights and ousted the intruders. He had spent eighteen years building\r\nthe road, and was naturally attached to it. He also found a Judge to aid\r\nhim. Justice E. Darwin Smith, of Rochester, eventually rendered a\r\ndecision in favor of the Ramsey party, with the opinion that “Mr. Fisk’s\r\nattempt to carry the election by his contingent of ‘toughs’ was a gross\r\nperversion and abuse of the right to vote by proxy, tending to convert\r\ncorporation meetings into places of disorder, lawlessness and riot.”\r\nCosts were decreed to the Ramsey directors, and a reference made to\r\nex-Judge Samuel L. Selden, of the Court of Appeals, who fixed the\r\nallowance to be paid by the Fisk board to the Ramsey board at $92,000.\r\nIt is worthy of note that the Fisk board consisted of the unlucky number\r\nof thirteen.\r\n\r\nThe Erie party appealed, but long before the appeal could be heard the\r\nAlbany & Susquehanna was leased in perpetuity to the Delaware & Hudson\r\nCanal Company, against whom the Erie party was not strong enough to go\r\nto law. Thus ended the struggle for this great connecting link.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that this was one of the few cases in which,\r\nwhere Mr. Gould made up his mind to obtain the control, possession or\r\nownership of property, he did not succeed.\r\n\r\nThe methods of acquiring the control and the possession of other\r\npeople’s property have been raised to the dignity of a fine art by Mr.\r\nGould. This art has been prosecuted, too, through “legitimate” means. He\r\nhas had the law at his back every time, and been supported in his\r\nmarvellous acquisitions by the highest Court authority.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he managed to get Western Union into his hands\r\naffords a very striking illustration of his methods and the great secret\r\nof his success.\r\n\r\nWhen first laying his schemes to obtain the control of the telegraph\r\nproperty he got up a construction company to build a telegraph line.\r\nThis was a company of exceedingly modest pretensions. It had a capital\r\nof only $5,000. It built the lines of the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany, with which Mr. Gould paralleled most of the important lines of\r\nWestern Union, and cut the rates until the older and larger corporation\r\nfound that its profits were being reduced towards the vanishing point.\r\nThen it was glad to make terms with its competitor; a union of interests\r\nwas the result, and Mr. Gould obtained control of the united concern.\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” said Norvin Green, in high dudgeon, when the insidious\r\nintentions of Mr. Gould were broached to him a few months before the\r\nsettlement took place. “It would bankrupt Gould and all his connections\r\nto parallel our lines, and to talk of harmony between him and us is the\r\nwildest kind of speculation.” The genial Doctor was then master of the\r\nsituation in Western Union, or imagined himself so at that time, and\r\nregarded with contempt the efforts of Gould and his colleagues to bring\r\nthe company to terms. In a few months afterward the Doctor tamely\r\nsubmitted to play second fiddle to the little man whom he had formerly\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement in reference to the cable companies followed the capture\r\nof Western Union. The struggle is still pending for the entire monopoly\r\nin the cable business, and it now seems only a question of time when the\r\nBennett-Mackay party will have to succumb, leaving Gould in the supreme\r\ncontrol of the news of the world. If this should happen he would become\r\nan immense power for either good or evil both in speculation and\r\npolitics. In fact it would be too great a monopoly to be entrusted to\r\nthe will of one man. Although it might be judiciously managed, as the\r\ncup of his ambition would then be surely full, yet the experiment would\r\nbe extremely hazardous.\r\n\r\nThe controlling interest in the Elevated Railroads of this city,\r\nrecently achieved by Mr. Gould through his business and speculative\r\nrelations with Mr. Cyrus W. Field, are of too recent date to require any\r\nspecial notice or comment here. Suffice it to say, that I fear my friend\r\nMr. Field has not come out at the big end of the horn, although\r\neverything has no doubt been in conformity with the most approved\r\nbusiness principles and in strict adherence to the most honorable\r\nmethods of dealing in railroad securities. It is significant, however,\r\nthat Mr. Field has preserved a prudent reticence on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould, from my point of view, has been a public benefactor in the\r\nbold and successful stand which he has maintained against strikers.\r\nThough Western Union lost over half a million dollars by the strike of\r\nthe telegraphers, which greatly alarmed the stockholders, yet Mr. Gould\r\nheld out until the strikers were obliged to give in. He pursued the same\r\npolicy, with a similar result, in the case of the Knights of Labor.\r\nDuring the strike of the latter I explained my views on the subject in a\r\ncircular to my customers as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Knights of Labor have undertaken to test, upon a large\r\n    scale, the application of compulsion as a means of enforcing\r\n    their now enlarged demands. This has necessitated a crisis of a\r\n    very serious kind. The point to be determined has been, whether\r\n    capital or labor shall in future determine the terms upon which\r\n    the invested resources of the nation are to be employed. To the\r\n    employer, it is a question whether his individual rights as to\r\n    the control of his property shall be so far overborne, as to not\r\n    only deprive him of his freedom, but also expose him to\r\n    interferences seriously impairing the value of his capital. To\r\n    the employes, it is a question whether, by the force of\r\n    coercion, they can wrest to their own profit powers and control\r\n    which, in every civilized community, are secured as the most\r\n    sacred and inalienable rights of the employer. This issue is so\r\n    absolutely revolutionary of the normal relations between capital\r\n    and labor, that it has naturally produced a partial paralysis of\r\n    business, especially among industries whose operations involve\r\n    contracts extending into the future. There has been at no time\r\n    any serious apprehension that such an utterly anarchial movement\r\n    could succeed, so long as American citizens have a clear\r\n    perception of their rights and their true interests; but it has\r\n    been distinctly perceived that this war could not fail to create\r\n    a divided if not a hostile feeling between the two great classes\r\n    of society; that it must hold in check, not only a large extent\r\n    of ordinary business operations but also the undertaking of\r\n    those new enterprises which contribute to our national progress,\r\n    and that the commercial markets must be subjected to serious\r\n    embarrassments. * * * * * From the nature of the case, however,\r\n    this labor disease must soon end one way or another; and there\r\n    is not much difficulty in foreseeing what its termination will\r\n    be. The demands of the Knights and their sympathizers, whether\r\n    openly expressed or temporarily concealed, are so utterly\r\n    revolutionary of the inalienable rights of the citizen, and so\r\n    completely subversive of social order, that the whole community\r\n    has come to a firm conclusion that these pretensions must be\r\n    resisted to the last extremity of endurance and authority.”\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Mr. Gould acquired his great control in some of the\r\nWestern and Southwestern railroads was pretty fully developed in the\r\nrecent investigation held in this city, Boston and San Francisco by the\r\nPacific Railway Commissioners. Mr. Gould’s testimony, as reported in the\r\ndaily papers of May, 1887, probably contains almost as correct and\r\nsuccinct an account of his pooling arrangements and schemes in\r\nconnection with certain railroads and his methods of making money out of\r\nthem as can be obtained anywhere. His testimony, on the whole, was\r\nexceedingly affable, comprehensive and precisely to the point, and has\r\nnot been contradicted in any material points by any of the succeeding\r\nwitnesses that have yet been examined on this widely interesting\r\nsubject. Its substance was as follows:\r\n\r\n                   [_From the Herald, May 18, 1887._]\r\n\r\n    A dapper little man in plain pepper and salt (the pepper\r\n    predominating) business suit entered the Pacific Railway\r\n    Commissioners’ offices yesterday morning and sat down quietly\r\n    with his not over shiny silk hat on his knee.\r\n\r\n    The natty gentleman, unobtrusive possessor of the small dark and\r\n    brilliant eyes, was the man of millions.\r\n\r\n    He had lots of information for the Commission, and he gave them\r\n    more of the inside facts of the early consolidation deals of the\r\n    Union Pacific than they hoped to get.\r\n\r\n    It had been expected that Mr. Gould would prove a wily witness,\r\n    hard to corral and liable to shy over the fence at the slightest\r\n    provocation, but at the very outset his manner was a complete\r\n    surprise. He told the Commission that he was suffering from\r\n    neuralgia, and said that he could not speak very loud in\r\n    consequence. There were times during his examination that his\r\n    tone was faint, and it was only loud two or three times, when he\r\n    became very much interested in some explanation. At all times,\r\n    however, it was well modulated, and now and again had a musical\r\n    cadence about it that was very pleasing. He first became\r\n    interested in Pacific roads in 1873. He bought Union Pacific\r\n    stock in the market, but it went down to fourteen cents on the\r\n    dollar. He held about 100,000 shares. He had a consultation with\r\n    Sidney Dillon, and finally made a proposition to fund the\r\n    floating debt in bonds, of which he took a million dollars’\r\n    worth at above their par value. In 1874 he became a director and\r\n    served on the executive committee. He continued in the direction\r\n    during 1874, 1875 and 1876, and went over the road twice a year.\r\n    He had no interest in the Fisk suit, but knew it was brought. He\r\n    had no contingent interest whatever in the suit.\r\n\r\n    He became interested in the Kansas Pacific in 1878, but thought\r\n    he knew the road in 1874. He remembered a proposition looking\r\n    toward a unity of interest between the Denver Pacific and the\r\n    Colorado Central.\r\n\r\n    Being examined as to the positions of the roads, and as things\r\n    did not appear to be very clear, Mr. Gould, putting his hand to\r\n    his inside pocket, said: “I have a little map here if you are\r\n    not familiar with the location.”\r\n\r\n    The little map was brought out and all hands gathered around it,\r\n    while Mr. Gould’s index finger went on an excursion over States\r\n    and Territories in absolute defiance of the Inter-State Commerce\r\n    Law. He recalled the fact that the plan of consolidation was\r\n    considered as early as 1875, after Mr. Anderson read some\r\n    extract from a paper, but he said it was not carried out then.\r\n    He might even have had a talk with Scott about it on further\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\n    The little road connecting with the Colorado Central was built\r\n    by him, and was the result partly of the contest between the\r\n    Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific. Prior to 1878 he could not\r\n    recollect having owned any stock or securities of the Kansas\r\n    Pacific. His interest in the Union Pacific has increased to\r\n    200,000 shares, the total issue of stocks being 367,000 shares.\r\n    He kept books of his transactions. Mr. Morosini kept them a part\r\n    of the time.\r\n\r\n    Q. Where are the books? A. I have them.\r\n\r\n    Q. Where? A. In my possession.\r\n\r\n    Q. Are they at the service of the Commission? A. If they desire\r\n    them, with the greatest of pleasure.\r\n\r\n    This was the first sensation of the day, and the witness smiled\r\n    blandly as he felt the full force of it.\r\n\r\n    Up to this time he had answered every question promptly. There\r\n    appeared to be no hesitation on his part, and, indeed, there was\r\n    none during the entire day’s session. Almost every preceding\r\n    witness had taken refuge behind “I don’t know,” or “I cannot\r\n    remember,” or “Really I am not sure,” but there was none of this\r\n    from Gould. And the apparently full and free offer of his books\r\n    capped the climax.\r\n\r\n    After this whenever his memory was in any way at fault the\r\n    witness fell back on the books. In asking him what he had bought\r\n    certain stocks for he said the books would show.\r\n\r\n    “Will your books also show who the broker was?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, yes; certainly, certainly, certainly.”\r\n\r\n    In the matter of the St. Louis pool he had conversed with a\r\n    number of persons.\r\n\r\n    Q. With whom did you converse? A. I presume with all the signers\r\n    of the agreement.\r\n\r\n    Q. Will you tell us all about the preliminary measures leading\r\n    up to this? A. I would have the neuralgia a good deal worse than\r\n    I have if I undertook to tell you all of the details.\r\n\r\n    This was the original proposition of consolidation, which was a\r\n    stock instead of a bond agreement, and it was soon demonstrated\r\n    that it would not work.\r\n\r\n    Q. How soon after this was the new arrangement entered into? A.\r\n    Almost immediately afterward, I think. The object was the\r\n    funding of a heterogeneous mass of securities into one class of\r\n    securities.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you confer with others? A. I conferred with myself as\r\n    well as others. What I thought was a fair price for me was a\r\n    fair price for the others.\r\n\r\n    Q. To whom did you deliver your bonds? A. I suppose to the\r\n    committee, but I do not know.\r\n\r\n    Q. But you would not deliver $2,000,000 to a man in whom you did\r\n    not have confidence? A. Probably not.\r\n\r\n    Q. Who kept the accounts? A. I don’t know.\r\n\r\n    Q. You don’t remember? A. I don’t charge my memory with these\r\n    things after they are over, but my books will show, and they are\r\n    at the service of the Commission.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould’s manner in saying this was unusually suave and\r\n    polite, and the lines of his mouth relaxed just enough to\r\n    suggest a smile.\r\n\r\n    In speaking a few moments later of the securities bought by Mr.\r\n    Gould from the “St. Louis parties” he was asked of whom he\r\n    bought them.\r\n\r\n    “I cannot tell about that off-hand, but my books will show it.”\r\n\r\n    “Which of the St. Louis people did you confer with?”\r\n\r\n    “I think they came on here to see me. They were tired out and\r\n    wanted to sell, and came over to do it.”\r\n\r\n    “Then you bought all the securities first and tried to get some\r\n    other gentlemen to go in with you afterward?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, several gentlemen whom I thought would be of service to\r\n    the road. There ought to be some books. Somebody must have kept\r\n    accounts of the transactions. My recollection is that these\r\n    people came on and told me they wanted to sell. I asked them how\r\n    much they thought they ought to have and they gave me the price\r\n    quoted in the agreement.”\r\n\r\n    “I simply said, ‘I will take them,’ and that was all there was\r\n    to it. That is my recollection. In 1879 I owned about $4,000,000\r\n    worth.”\r\n\r\n    The examination led into the stamped income bonds of the Kansas\r\n    Pacific, and Mr. Gould was asked as to the condition of the\r\n    road. He thought it was poor. The road had a large intrinsic\r\n    value, but it had been badly financed and its securities were\r\n    way down.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you not buy some of your securities abroad? A. I bought\r\n    two millions of Denver Pacific at seventy-four cents, I think,\r\n    from some Amsterdam people. I was in London and heard that they\r\n    wanted to sell. I was afraid to go over, because I had very\r\n    little time, and thought they would probably take a couple of\r\n    days to smoke before finding out whether they would sell or not.\r\n    But I was mistaken. I went over and got to Amsterdam in the\r\n    morning; washed and had my breakfast. I saw them at eleven,\r\n    bought them out at twelve, and started back in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n    When Mr. Gould was asked as to the prices he had paid for the\r\n    securities with which he had acquired the Kansas Pacific bonds\r\n    he took out his papers and handed the Commission a series of\r\n    neatly written reports on these purchases and sales.\r\n\r\n    He purchased in 1879 St. Jo. and Denver first mortgage bonds,\r\n    $1,562,886.69, for $603,204.78.\r\n\r\n    Of these, $617,000 worth he sold to Russell Sage, F. L. Ames,\r\n    Sidney Dillon, S. H. H. Clark, Ezra H. Baker, F. G. Dexter and\r\n    Elisha Atkins for $246,800.\r\n\r\n    On January 24, 1880, he surrendered $956,779.76 in these bonds\r\n    and scrip in exchange for 9,568 shares of Union Pacific at par.\r\n\r\n    For St. Jo. and Denver Pacific receivers’ certificates to the\r\n    number of fifty-nine he paid $60,695, and on January 24, 1880,\r\n    he surrendered them for 590 shares of Union Pacific at par, or\r\n    $59,000.\r\n\r\n    Of St. J. and Denver stock during 1879 he acquired 8,819 shares,\r\n    and sold 3,806 shares to the same persons purchasing the bonds.\r\n    On January 24 he surrendered the 5,013 shares he had remaining\r\n    on hand at par for $100,200.\r\n\r\n    During the same time he bought $784,000 worth of the St. Joseph\r\n    Bridge bonds for $586,940, of which he sold to Sage and Dillon\r\n    $150,000 worth for $112,500.\r\n\r\n    He also bought 4,000 shares of stock for $6,000, making the\r\n    total cost of $634,000 bonds and 4,000 shares of stock $480,440.\r\n    Received in exchange for the whole business, 6,340 shares of\r\n    Union Pacific stock at par, making $634,000.\r\n\r\n    The gentlemen to whom Gould sold the securities were all\r\n    directors of the Union Pacific. These gentlemen, the witness\r\n    thought, retained their bonds until the consolidation, as they\r\n    were bought with a purpose. “The Denver stock was called\r\n    trimmings,” said Mr. Gould, smiling, “and went with the bonds.”\r\n\r\n    On the consolidation of the company he transferred 27,000 shares\r\n    of Union Pacific Railroad stock for new stock.\r\n\r\n    He had transferred his Union Pacific stock at one time to some\r\n    other parties on account of a peculiar law in Massachusetts,\r\n    which enables an attachment of stock on a suit, whether there\r\n    was anything in it or not.\r\n\r\n    “I found out about that law,” said Mr. Gould, “and put the stock\r\n    in somebody’s else’s name. You can’t tell anything,” he\r\n    continued, sharply, “about any stock list. There are many shares\r\n    of stock held by brokers for years.”\r\n\r\n    After the consolidation he had begun to distribute his stock\r\n    among other holders.\r\n\r\n    “I made up my mind,” he said, “it would be better to have four\r\n    or five stockholders do a little of the walking instead of one.”\r\n\r\n    Q. That idea was very much stimulated by the rise in the stock\r\n    after the consolidation, was it not? A. Yes, because the stock\r\n    went up then so much that there wasn’t enough to go round.\r\n\r\n    The witness told the story of the employing of General Dodge and\r\n    Solon Humphreys to recommend the consolidation. They were fair\r\n    men, he thought, and would make a fair report.\r\n\r\n    He had not talked to them after they went West to make their\r\n    report.\r\n\r\n    Q. How is that? A. Well, he naively replied, while they were\r\n    making their examination my interests had changed.\r\n\r\n    Q. They had changed? A. Yes, I had bought the Missouri Pacific.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did General Dodge and Mr. Humphreys look into the past\r\n    history of the road? A. I consider the future of a road more\r\n    important than its past.\r\n\r\n    Q. Yes, but what I want— A. The past was no criterion as to the\r\n    Union Pacific road.\r\n\r\n    Q. But don’t you think that General Dodge and Mr. Humphreys—? A.\r\n    “All my life,” said Mr. Gould, warming up; “all my life I have\r\n    been dealing in railroads—that is, since I have been of age, and\r\n    I have always considered their future and not their past.”\r\n\r\n    “That is the way I have made my money,” said he. “The very first\r\n    railroad I ever bought had a most deplorable past, but its\r\n    future was fair. I paid ten cents on the dollar for its bonds,\r\n    and finally sold the stock for $1.25. It was the future of the\r\n    Union Pacific that drew me into it. I went into it to make\r\n    money.”\r\n\r\n    “You were not in favor of the consolidation at the time it was\r\n    made?”\r\n\r\n    “No, my interests had changed.”\r\n\r\n    “Did you try to stop it?”\r\n\r\n    “Well,” said Mr. Gould, slowly, “my opposition to it was known\r\n    and they were greatly alarmed.”\r\n\r\n    “Who?”\r\n\r\n    “Ames, Dexter, Atkins and Dillon. They came on from Boston to\r\n    see me about it. They had heard that I was going to build an\r\n    extension to the Denver Pacific and connect the Missouri\r\n    Pacific. They said I was committed to the consolidation and laid\r\n    right down on me. I offered my check for $1,000,000 to let me\r\n    out, and I have offered it since.\r\n\r\n    “I will pay it now,” said the witness, with a strong rising\r\n    inflection of the voice and looking hard at the Union Pacific\r\n    people in the room.\r\n\r\n    “I offered them a million, but they would not let me out of the\r\n    room until I had signed an agreement to carry out the\r\n    consolidation.”\r\n\r\n    “Where is that paper?”\r\n\r\n    “I suppose it is in Boston. If I could have carried out my\r\n    Missouri Pacific plan I would have a property now that would be\r\n    worth par.”\r\n\r\n    “I don’t think you have any reason to complain of your profits\r\n    in the matter,” replied Mr. Anderson, at which Mr. Gould partly\r\n    closed his eyes to hide their twinkle, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n    The paper which he signed was an agreement to carry out the\r\n    consolidation on certain terms. The consolidation was an assured\r\n    fact after January 15, because the witness held the controlling\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\n    “But I have now ceased to be the tower of the Union Pacific,” he\r\n    said.\r\n\r\n    In asking Mr. Gould about his connection with Lawyer Holmes at\r\n    the time of the consolidation, Mr. Anderson asked him whether he\r\n    was sure about a certain conversation.\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” he said, “for I had it impressed on my mind.”\r\n\r\n    “How was that?”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I remember parting with a lot of stock at ten cents for\r\n    which I could have got par a few days afterward. Wouldn’t that\r\n    impress the occasion on your memory, Mr. Anderson?”\r\n\r\n    Everybody laughed at this, and the witness, although he had lost\r\n    a million or two, laughed as heartily as the loudest.\r\n\r\n    As far as the Denver Pacific stock was concerned Mr. Gould said\r\n    it was worth practically nothing unless the consolidation was\r\n    made. It was the signature of the Union Pacific that made it\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n    “Do you consider that the trustees fulfilled their duty in\r\n    letting this stock out of trust?” he was asked.\r\n\r\n    “I consider that it was the only thing to do, and I stand on\r\n    what was done. I am ready to take the responsibility for it that\r\n    day, or this day, or any other day.”\r\n\r\n               [_From the New York Times, May 19, 1887._]\r\n\r\n    Jay Gould gave another day to the Pacific Railway Commission\r\n    yesterday. His manner was, as usual, cool and collected, and he\r\n    was apparently full of a patient desire to tell everything he\r\n    knew. Yet Mr. Gould told very little, although he answered\r\n    hundreds of questions, some of them puzzling enough to drive a\r\n    less long-headed financier into a corner. The Denver Pacific\r\n    stock and the way it got out of the trust were first taken up.\r\n    Mr. Gould said he thought the course taken was best for\r\n    everybody. Naturally he wanted the Denver Pacific to go into the\r\n    consolidation, holding as he did, $1,000,000 of the securities,\r\n    and being trustee of over $3,000,000 more. At first it was\r\n    doubtful if the Union Pacific would take it, but it did for the\r\n    franchises. “I want to say again,” declared Mr. Gould, “that no\r\n    director or person connected with the Union Pacific ever made a\r\n    dollar out of Denver Pacific. I am glad to put a final nail in\r\n    that coffin.”\r\n\r\n    His plan at one time was to build a line from Denver to Ogden,\r\n    via Salt Lake and Loveland Pass. It would have been shorter than\r\n    the Union Pacific and obtained more local business, for the\r\n    Union Pacific ran north of the mineral belt and the Southern\r\n    Pacific south of it. After he obtained the Missouri Pacific he\r\n    saw what a good thing he had in it, but he was persuaded to give\r\n    his pledge to go on with the consolidation of the other roads.\r\n    The Boston folk became agitated within a month after he bought\r\n    the Missouri Pacific, and got the pledge from him. If the\r\n    Missouri Pacific had been put through it would have injured the\r\n    Union Pacific a great deal.\r\n\r\n    “According to the ethics of Wall Street,” Mr. Gould was asked,\r\n    do you consider it absolutely within the limits of your duty,\r\n    while a director of the Union Pacific, to purchase another\r\n    property and to design an extension of the road which would\r\n    perhaps ruin the Union Pacific?”\r\n\r\n    “I don’t think it would have been proper. That’s the reason I\r\n    let it go.”\r\n\r\n    “Did you consider your duty to the Government?”\r\n\r\n    “I had considered it.”\r\n\r\n    “How would the Government claim have been affected by building a\r\n    parallel line?”\r\n\r\n    “It would have been wiped out.”\r\n\r\n    After the Thurman bill had been sustained by the Supreme Court\r\n    Mr. Gould had a plan to build a road from Omaha to Ogden, just\r\n    outside the right of way of the Union Pacific, and give that\r\n    road back to the Government. It would give others “a chance to\r\n    walk.” The Government tried to squeeze more out of the turnip\r\n    than was in it. For $15,000,000 a road could be built where it\r\n    had cost the Union Pacific $75,000,000.\r\n\r\n    “You were not devoted to the interests of the Government?”\r\n\r\n    “I wanted to protect them. Their legislative action hurt their\r\n    own interests and put those of the stockholders in jeopardy. The\r\n    Government repudiated their own contracts. Cash was offered to\r\n    pay the Government the Union Pacific debt. I had the debt\r\n    reckoned up and offered to pay it. In 1877 or 1878 I made the\r\n    offer to the Judiciary Committee, of which Mr. Edmunds was\r\n    Chairman. I made the offer myself. The debt was estimated at\r\n    $15,000,000 or $17,000,000. But the Government would not concede\r\n    that interest terminated with the bonds. No action was taken on\r\n    the proposition.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould thought he wrote his own resignation as Director of\r\n    the Union Pacific. He resigned because he ought not to deal with\r\n    the company while one of its directors. He put it in President\r\n    Dillon’s office. Mr. Dillon knew what it meant.\r\n\r\n    “What did it mean?”\r\n\r\n    “That if the consolidation went through it involved large\r\n    transactions with Jay Gould, and if I had stayed in it would\r\n    have complicated things. Before January 10, 1880, no bargain was\r\n    made to pay par for St. Jo. and Western bonds, nor Kansas\r\n    Central, nor 239 for Central Branch stock. That came afterward.”\r\n\r\n    The Colorado Central lease was canceled on account of a State\r\n    law against consolidating competing lines. Mr. Gould did not\r\n    know that the Dodge and Humphreys letter was to be presented to\r\n    the meeting of January 24. He was probably informed of the\r\n    consolidation on the day it took place. He was also probably\r\n    present at the first meeting of the new company on January 24.\r\n    Mr. Gould’s resignation from the Kansas Pacific Board was gone\r\n    over, and in summarizing his reasons for resigning Mr. Gould\r\n    said he did not want to be mixed up with trusteeships and\r\n    directorships. When he was not a Union Pacific director he felt\r\n    at liberty to take care of himself. There was a chance that the\r\n    properties might be made hostile to him, and then it would have\r\n    been improper for him to be a director. He did not know that\r\n    Russell Sage was to move the acceptance of his resignation.\r\n\r\n    “At the Kansas Pacific meeting a list of the branch lines\r\n    obtained from you was read. President Dillon said the company\r\n    had bought them. What did he mean?”\r\n\r\n    “Possibly he referred to the directors’ agreement with me.”\r\n\r\n    “But we can find no record of this in the books. Don’t you think\r\n    he referred to the agreement with the Boston gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n    “Very likely, but it had no authority until it was accepted or\r\n    rejected.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould was set to explaining some discrepancies between the\r\n    accounts of his dealings in branch securities, handed in on\r\n    Tuesday, and the list submitted by Controller Mink. Mr. Mink\r\n    gave 15,162 shares of St. Jo. and Western stock, and Mr. Gould\r\n    8,119. The difference was explained by Mr. Gould’s getting some\r\n    stock for building the Hastings and Grand Island. He retained\r\n    control of the $150,000 St. Jo. Bridge bonds he sold Dillon and\r\n    Sage and turned them over with his own. His $479,000 Kansas\r\n    Central bonds and 2,521 shares of the stock cost him $431,820.25\r\n    at the time he bought the Missouri Pacific. They all went into\r\n    the consolidation for $479,000. Mr. Gould bought the Central\r\n    Branch of the Union Pacific from Oliver Ames and President\r\n    Pomeroy, who came to New York and induced him to go and look at\r\n    the property.\r\n\r\n    “I thought it was doing a big business,” said he. “Afterward I\r\n    learned they had kept the freight back for a week to impress me.\r\n    So I saw a freight train at every station when I got there. I\r\n    bought the road anyway.” Its total cost to Mr. Gould was\r\n    $1,826,500. Over the Central Branch, whose stock was disposed of\r\n    by Mr. Gould for 239, there was a little stir in the hearing,\r\n    but the witness tranquilly explained that the road was\r\n    practically stocked at only $2,500 a mile, and therefore the\r\n    stock ought to range way above par.\r\n\r\n    “Has the road earned dividends?” he was asked.\r\n\r\n    “I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n    “Have the aggregate earnings exceeded the fixed and Government\r\n    charges?”\r\n\r\n    “I never figured it out. Stock doesn’t always depend upon\r\n    dividends altogether. I paid 750 for my Missouri Pacific—4,000\r\n    shares at that figure. You pay more for rubies than for diamonds\r\n    and more for diamonds than for glass.”\r\n\r\n    Then the examination turned to the days just after the\r\n    consolidation, and the witness was asked if there was any\r\n    corporate action of the new company before the stock was turned\r\n    over to him.\r\n\r\n    “All I know,” he said, “is that the stock of the new company was\r\n    delivered.”\r\n\r\n    “Was the new company bound to carry out the Kansas Pacific\r\n    obligations of this sort?”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I suppose it assumed the Kansas Pacific obligations.”\r\n\r\n    “Why were you not paid in Kansas Pacific consols instead of\r\n    stock?”\r\n\r\n    “I suppose they preferred stock to bonds. I was clever to them\r\n    and took stock.”\r\n\r\n    Another turn carried questions and answers to other differences\r\n    in the accounts, but the commission got little light. “It’s safe\r\n    to say the lawyers got the difference,” chuckled Mr. Gould, at\r\n    the end of the set of questions. He had made large cash\r\n    advances, at different times, to the Kansas Pacific to meet the\r\n    floating debt, and very likely these would have to be counted in\r\n    to explain matters in all cases. There was one point upon which\r\n    the witness strongly insisted, and that was that all through the\r\n    negotiations and transactions no class of people nor any\r\n    particular holders of securities experienced any discrimination\r\n    in their favor, as compared with the treatment given everybody\r\n    else.\r\n\r\n    After the consolidation Mr. Gould said he had few transactions\r\n    in Union Pacific branch lines. He had an interest in the Denver\r\n    & South Park, however, a minority interest at first, but\r\n    subsequently he bought the whole road from Governor Evans. “I’m\r\n    showing you my whole hand,” he said, cheerfully, at the end of\r\n    the catalogue of the branches. Of the Union Pacific’s legal\r\n    expenses he knew of none which were not perfectly legal.\r\n\r\n    “Who were the road’s counsel in Washington?”\r\n\r\n    “Messrs. Shellabarger & Wilson were the only ones, as far as I\r\n    knew.”\r\n\r\n    “Have you ever been to Washington on business of the company?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes. And I paid my own hotel bills.”\r\n\r\n    “Do you recall persons sent to Washington from other places in\r\n    the interest of the road?”\r\n\r\n    “Judge Usher and Mr. Poppleton.”\r\n\r\n    “Who represented the Kansas Pacific?”\r\n\r\n    “Judge Usher. I don’t know that they had anybody in Washington.”\r\n\r\n    “How often did you go to Washington for the road?”\r\n\r\n    “I was there while the Thurman bill was pending. It passed, and\r\n    I haven’t been there since. No, I take that back. I was down\r\n    before the Labor Committee. I got rather disgusted.”\r\n\r\n    “Do you know whether anything was spent to influence\r\n    legislation?”\r\n\r\n    “No, sir. I know of no such expenditure.”\r\n\r\n    “Where could we find records of such transactions?”\r\n\r\n    “I don’t think such transactions exist.”\r\n\r\n    “Do you remember advising, at a meeting, that Mr. Ordway, of\r\n    Washington, be employed in the interests of the Kansas Pacific?”\r\n\r\n    “No, sir.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Anderson read from the minutes of a Kansas Pacific meeting,\r\n    in 1876, and Mr. Gould remembered that Senator Rollins, a great\r\n    friend of Mr. Ordway, asked him to write a letter about it. He\r\n    knew of nothing coming from the letter.\r\n\r\n    “Do you remember any talk of fighting the Credit Mobilier?”\r\n\r\n    “I saw some of their stockholders and they said they would turn\r\n    in their stock to us. Others wouldn’t. The Credit stockholders\r\n    alleged that the Union Pacific owed their company a great deal\r\n    of money. I succeeded in getting the great bulk of the stock\r\n    turned over before a judgment was obtained.”\r\n\r\n    “You remember your address to the Union Pacific president and\r\n    directors.”\r\n\r\n    “I wanted to put myself in a position to bring a suit.”\r\n\r\n    “Who opposed this proposed action of yours?” asked Mr. Anderson,\r\n    reading from the minutes of a directors’ meeting that Mr. Dexter\r\n    moved “to decline to bring suit, as requested by Mr. Gould.”\r\n\r\n    “I think the directors declined, and I brought the suits\r\n    individually.”\r\n\r\n    “There is another letter of yours to the directors, requesting\r\n    them to begin suit against the Credit for a full accounting of\r\n    all profits, under certain alleged contracts,” etc.\r\n\r\n    “I think that was on a different set of contracts.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Frederick L. Ames, the first witness called, testified that\r\n    he was formerly a stockholder in the Union Pacific Railroad, and\r\n    is a cousin of the Hon. Oliver Ames, Governor of the\r\n    Commonwealth. He was familiar with the relations of this road\r\n    and the Kansas Pacific Road prior to 1877. “I personally\r\n    attended,” he said, “to the affairs of the road under the\r\n    direction of my father, Oliver Ames. The first dividend of the\r\n    road was paid in 1875 or 1876. I do not remember the rate paid.\r\n    I was somewhat familiar with the condition of the Kansas\r\n    Pacific. I did not think the stock of much value in 1877. Mr.\r\n    Jay Gould was instrumental in buying up the Kansas Pacific\r\n    securities in 1876. I understood that he owned a large amount of\r\n    the funding bonds and unstamped incomes. I never knew what the\r\n    respective interests of any of the gentlemen interested were. I\r\n    owned no securities that entered into that pool. I received two\r\n    certificates for $50,000 each. I have not these in my possession\r\n    now. They were turned over to somebody. These certificates were\r\n    probably issued to every member of the pool. I think I paid\r\n    $100,000 to the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Anderson—Have you been able to find those certificates, Mr.\r\n    Mink?\r\n\r\n    Controller Mink—They are not in our possession, sir.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Anderson—It is very strange that we cannot get any clue to\r\n    these certificates.\r\n\r\n    Continuing, Mr. Ames testified as to the manner in which the\r\n    business of the pool was conducted, a copy of the consolidated\r\n    mortgage being introduced in evidence.\r\n\r\n    “I do not remember,” he said, “that I ever contributed the\r\n    $388,000 funding bonds named in this mortgage. My connection\r\n    with this pool was limited to the advancement or the $100,000.\r\n    The pooling rates and mortgage rates were identical. I was a\r\n    director in the Kansas Pacific Road in 1879. I cannot explain\r\n    why bonds were issued to persons having claims against the road\r\n    at a rate which would exaggerate its indebtedness more than\r\n    $1,000,000. I exchanged my bonds for Kansas Pacific bonds. I do\r\n    not remember that, in 1880, $2,950,000 of preferred stock was\r\n    issued to Jay Gould at 75 when the bonds were worth 94. I do not\r\n    know of any other transaction of the kind. I do not know how the\r\n    Kansas Pacific Road came to be indebted to Jay Gould for\r\n    $2,000,000 at this time. All the directors were in favor of the\r\n    consolidation except Jay Gould. He was unwilling to accede to\r\n    any such terms as we thought we were entitled to, and seemed\r\n    very much agitated at the course we had taken. The final\r\n    consummation was reached at Mr. Gould’s house. I do not remember\r\n    that we would not let Mr. Gould leave the room until he had\r\n    signed the paper. The paper was signed by all present. The basis\r\n    of the consolidation was $50,000,000.”\r\n\r\n    When asked how he explained the payment of dividends by the\r\n    Union Pacific with a condition of affairs which requires a sale\r\n    of stock for the extinction of a floating debt, Mr. Ames said\r\n    that the declaration of the dividend was made upon the statement\r\n    of the net earnings, and the road might very well have earned\r\n    the dividends several times over and at the same time have been\r\n    building roads and borrowing money and using its funds for other\r\n    purposes, in addition to the property, which would not interfere\r\n    with the right to declare dividends. Mr. Ames also said that the\r\n    directors of the Union Pacific were largely controlled in\r\n    signing the agreement read at the forenoon session by the fact\r\n    that they were cornered by Jay Gould. “I think it has resulted\r\n    favorably for the Union Pacific,” he continued, “and I would not\r\n    take back the action if I could. I made nothing by the\r\n    consolidation, as I did not sell my Kansas Pacific stock, but\r\n    hold it now. Mr. Gould made about $3,500,000.”\r\n\r\n    Judge Dillon cross-examined Mr. Ames, and showed from his\r\n    evidence that he had no personal ends served by the\r\n    consolidation. He said that his interest in the Union Pacific is\r\n    larger now than it was in 1880, and that he is one of the\r\n    largest stockholders.\r\n\r\n                       JAY GOULD AND HIS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe following from the New York _Times_ of April 27, 1887, contains a\r\ngraphic account of Mr. Gould’s mode of reviewing his system of\r\nrailroads:\r\n\r\n    On first thought it seems almost impossible that Jay Gould has\r\n    only been a railroad magnate of the first class little more than\r\n    half a decade, yet such is the fact. In 1879 he owned only the\r\n    nucleus of his present Southwestern system of railroads, and as\r\n    the rival of the Wabash through considerable territory was the\r\n    Missouri Pacific, he felt by no means at ease regarding the\r\n    ultimate fate of his venture. Commodore Garrison owned a\r\n    controlling interest in Missouri Pacific, which was managed by\r\n    his brother Oliver. Commodore Garrison did not like Mr. Gould,\r\n    and would not have objected to make Gould’s purchase of Wabash a\r\n    dear bargain. He probably would have done so had it not been for\r\n    Oliver Garrison. The latter and Ben W. Lewis, Gould’s manager of\r\n    the Wabash, were close friends, and Garrison, as chief executive\r\n    of the Missouri Pacific, did nothing to injure Gould’s property.\r\n    But when Mr. Lewis called upon Mr. Gould in New York one day\r\n    toward the close of 1879, and tendered his resignation on the\r\n    ground of other interests which claimed his attention, Gould\r\n    immediately saw breakers ahead, and said so. Lewis suggested\r\n    that he remove the breakers by buying the control of Missouri\r\n    Pacific. The suggestion was not allowed to get moldy. Gould\r\n    called upon Oliver Garrison and offered $1,500,000 for the\r\n    Garrison interest in the road. Garrison was much surprised, and\r\n    said it would be necessary to consult with the Commodore. He\r\n    said, however, that $1,500,000 was at least $500,000 too low.\r\n    When the Commodore heard of Gould’s offer he rubbed his hands,\r\n    laughed, and put the price at $2,800,000. Gould retorted that he\r\n    could have bought it on the previous day for $2,000,000. The\r\n    Commodore explained that the difference between yesterday and\r\n    to-day was $800,000. Gould said nothing and retired. He made\r\n    another effort on the following day. The Commodore had been\r\n    thinking. His thoughts cost Mr. Gould $1,000,000, for his price\r\n    on the third day of the negotiations was $3,800,000. Mr. Gould\r\n    did not express his thoughts, but his speech demonstrated that\r\n    he appreciated the danger and expense of delay. He said, “I’ll\r\n    take it,” and he did. Thus from a beginning of less than 1,000\r\n    miles he secured control of a system of over 5,000, forming the\r\n    Missouri Pacific, Iron Mountain, and International and Great\r\n    Northern and their branches into one compact system. The\r\n    bargain, in comparison with the present value of the properly,\r\n    was as close a one as Mr. Gould ever managed to make, and from\r\n    the day it was closed he has lost no opportunity of extending\r\n    his railroad properly, which, with lines that are yet on paper,\r\n    but are almost certain to be built, is soon likely to embrace at\r\n    least 6,000 miles of rail.\r\n\r\n    Though the General Manager’s office is at St. Louis, and none of\r\n    the Gould roads—for the Wabash is not considered in the\r\n    system—run east of the Mississippi, nothing of importance is\r\n    transacted there without the knowledge and sanction of Mr.\r\n    Gould. Private wires run from the St. Louis office to the\r\n    Western Union Building, in which is Mr. Gould’s private office,\r\n    where he spends some hours each day sitting at a desk that never\r\n    ought to have cost more than $25.\r\n\r\n    He has traveled many times over every mile of his railroads.\r\n    There is an immensity of interest in such a trip when made for\r\n    the first time, or even the second or third, but it has been\r\n    made so often by Mr. Gould that he has thoroughly absorbed all\r\n    the pleasure to be obtained from it except that which smacks of\r\n    dollars and power. His trips occupy about three weeks from the\r\n    time his special car, the Convoy, leaves St. Louis until it\r\n    returns to that hot and dusty city of pageants and conventions.\r\n\r\n    When word is flashed to St. Louis that Mr. Gould is on his way,\r\n    every official on the system packs his head full of information,\r\n    and there is unwonted activity from Omaha to Galveston and from\r\n    Fort Worth to San Antonio. All of the system’s executive force\r\n    was selected either by Mr. Gould or by trusted officials in whom\r\n    he had implicit faith, and the heads of divisions who work for\r\n    Jay Gould could not work harder for anybody else, although in\r\n    some instances their bank accounts do not show it.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould lately was in the Southwest on a tour of inspection.\r\n    On his trips he is always accompanied by General Superintendent\r\n    Kerrigan, a New Yorker by birth, a South-westerner by education.\r\n    Physically they are in marked contrast. The cleanly shaven,\r\n    fair-complexioned Superintendent would make two of his employer.\r\n    In manner they are much alike, though Kerrigan has a spice of\r\n    bluffness that is lacking in the other. He has the composed,\r\n    unexcitable manner of Gould to perfection, and is never known,\r\n    no matter how great the provocation may be, to speak except in a\r\n    low-pitched tone. He is a walking railroad encyclopedia, and has\r\n    the topographical features of the Southwest—every corner of\r\n    it—at his fingers’ ends. He has been employed on railroads of\r\n    the system for over thirty years. From his Superintendent Mr.\r\n    Gould obtains such details as the latter gathers from the\r\n    Division Superintendents and other officials, but in making a\r\n    trip Mr. Gould insists upon stopping at every point included in\r\n    one of Mr. Kerrigan’s regular trips of supervision. He is always\r\n    accompanied by a stenographer, who is also a typewriter, and the\r\n    Superintendent and the heads of divisions follow the same plan.\r\n\r\n    Upon arriving at a station at which it has been decided to make\r\n    an inspection, Mr. Gould asks how long a stop will be made. The\r\n    answer may be “an hour.” Mr. Gould looks at his watch. He then\r\n    accompanies the Superintendent on a part of his rounds, listens\r\n    quietly to his talk with the railroad officials of the place,\r\n    and having heard all he cares to listen to, wanders around by\r\n    himself while the Superintendent picks up the information which\r\n    later he will give to his employer. Mr. Gould manifests no\r\n    impatience until the hour has been exhausted. But if the\r\n    engineer is not ready to start on the minute, and all hands are\r\n    not in their places on the car, he begins to fidget, and is\r\n    restless until a fresh start is made.\r\n\r\n    He is a strong advocate of method. The day’s work is laid out in\r\n    the morning and almost before the train starts in the morning he\r\n    has settled how many stops can be made during the day and where\r\n    the night can be spent. He dines and sleeps on board his car\r\n    from the start to the finish of a three weeks’ trip. At night\r\n    the Convoy is run to the quietest part of the yard, as the owner\r\n    objects to more noise than he can avoid at night, though he can\r\n    apparently stand as much as any one else in daylight. His car is\r\n    always a curiosity along the line, and people come from far and\r\n    near to look at it as it stands in the evening in a secluded\r\n    spot, secure in its loneliness. In some parts of the country\r\n    through which his roads run he is quite as much of a curiosity\r\n    in the eyes of the country folk as a circus, and were he to\r\n    stand on the platform after the manner of James G. Blaine, would\r\n    attract quite as big a crowd as that gentleman. He is never\r\n    apparently anxious to achieve notoriety in that way, and is\r\n    quite as modest in his demeanor while on one of his tours as he\r\n    is in his office or his Fifth Avenue mansion. In the latter, as\r\n    a few newspaper reporters know, he is more unassuming and far\r\n    more polite than a majority of his thousand-dollar employes.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould meets some odd as well as prominent people on his\r\n    trips and occasionally has a peculiar experience. On his first\r\n    visit to Galveston, Texas, he discovered that it was on an\r\n    island. Like a good many others he imagined it was on the\r\n    mainland. On this occasion a number of citizens had been\r\n    appointed to do him honor and he had promised to take up his\r\n    quarters at a hotel. The committee had neglected to secure\r\n    carriages for the party, and made a desperate effort just before\r\n    the arrival of his car to repair the omission. This it was\r\n    unable to do. There was an election at Galveston on that\r\n    particular day. It was a hot one, both the day and the election,\r\n    and everything on wheels had been bought up by the contending\r\n    parties. Twenty dollars was offered for a hack and refused. The\r\n    committee felt forlorn until Mr. Gould laughed at its dilemma\r\n    and remarked that he saw no hills that he couldn’t climb. This\r\n    is the only joke charged against Mr. Gould by the people who\r\n    live on the line of his roads, for the highest point of\r\n    Galveston is only three feet above the sea level. The\r\n    inhabitants claim four feet, and denounce as a libel the\r\n    statement made by people who live inland to the effect that tide\r\n    water is three feet higher than Galveston.\r\n\r\n    While skimming along over the International and Great Northern,\r\n    between Houston and Galveston, Mr. Gould cannot look on either\r\n    side of him without looking at land owned by A. A. Talmage,\r\n    manager of the Wabash Railroad. Mr. Talmage owns a tract or\r\n    ranch—though there are but few cattle on it—of 160,000 acres.\r\n    For this land Mr. Talmage paid 12½ cents per acre. He would\r\n    probably refuse to sell it to-day for $6 an acre. If Mr. Talmage\r\n    owned nothing else besides this ranch he might be considered\r\n    above want. Mr. Gould owns some land in different parts of the\r\n    country also, but as a proprietor of the soil he occupies a much\r\n    lower grade than Manager Talmage. George Gould probably owns as\r\n    much land—railroad land grants not considered—in the Southwest\r\n    as his father, and is always on the lookout for bargains. These\r\n    are always to be had at the close of a disastrous agricultural\r\n    or cattle season. Newcomers in Texas are liable to forget that\r\n    disastrous years only occur occasionally, and that in three\r\n    favorable seasons the profits will be large enough to stand one\r\n    bad season in three. They may hear of all this after they sell\r\n    out, but the old settler is not offering information that can\r\n    only be bought with experience until it is valuable as a\r\n    mournful reflection.\r\n\r\n    The Iron Mountain Railroad has a station called Malvern. It is\r\n    44 miles south of Little Rock. As his car pulls into Malvern Mr.\r\n    Gould sees on a narrow gauge railroad that also has a station\r\n    there an engine with a diamond-shaped head-light. The narrow\r\n    gauge road runs from Malvern to Hot Springs. Mr. Gould has no\r\n    interest in it, but he knows it was built and is owned—every\r\n    spike in it—by a man who received his first start in life from\r\n    the same man who placed him on his feet. The Hot Springs\r\n    railroad is owned by “Diamond Joe” Reynolds, who was started in\r\n    business many years ago by Zadock Pratt, of the town of\r\n    Prattsville, Greene county, N. Y., when the young man lived in\r\n    Sullivan county, right across the line of Delaware county,\r\n    Penn., where Jay Gould was enabled by Mr. Pratt to tan hides\r\n    with oak and hemlock bark, not after the fashion of Wall Street.\r\n    Reynolds and Gould were assisted by Mr. Pratt about the same\r\n    time. Reynolds is not as wealthy to-day as Mr. Gould, but he\r\n    owns all the money he wants, and Mr. Gould has often said it did\r\n    not need fifty millions to secure contentment. “Diamond Joe”\r\n    Reynolds is a rich man and he spends much of his time between\r\n    Chicago and Hot Springs. On his first visit to Hot Springs he\r\n    was compelled to stage it from Malvern. The ride disgusted him\r\n    as much as the Springs delighted him. He found a man who had\r\n    obtained a charter for a railroad from Malvern to the Springs\r\n    and who had no money. The charter and some money changed hands.\r\n    Reynolds built the railroad and owns it, rolling stock and all.\r\n    The road is 24 miles long. He made his money in wheat, but not\r\n    in Sullivan county. After getting a start there he went West and\r\n    shipped wheat from Wisconsin to Chicago. He shipped it in sacks\r\n    and marked the sacks with a diamond and inclosed in it the\r\n    letters “J. O.” It was from this circumstance, because the sacks\r\n    and trade mark became widely known, that he obtained the\r\n    sobriquet of “Diamond Joe,” and not as those who have only heard\r\n    of him think for a penchant for gems, and Mr. Reynolds is modest\r\n    as well as rich.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gould travels like a rocket while inspecting his roads. In\r\n    this way he gets a certain amount of exercise, for, as travelers\r\n    know, a heavy train drawn at the rate of 50 miles an hour will\r\n    make little fuss in comparison with the antics of a single car\r\n    tacked to an engine making the same rate. Mr. Gould often\r\n    travels in the Convoy at a 50-mile gait, and during such a trip\r\n    he has been known to change seats—from one side of the car to\r\n    the other—not of his own volition, but without changing\r\n    countenance. So long as Superintendent Kerrigan keeps his hand\r\n    off the bell rope Mr. Gould makes no remonstrance, but accepts\r\n    his shaking without a grumble. He changed engineers on one of\r\n    his recent trips without knowing it. The engineer had been\r\n    running slowly, for reasons of his own, in spite of numerous\r\n    pulls at the bell cord. When, however, he discovered that dinner\r\n    was under way he pulled the throttle open, and the locomotive\r\n    darted ahead suddenly as if going through space. The jar cleaned\r\n    the table like a flash. At the next station the engineer was\r\n    promoted to a freight train.\r\n\r\n                   A REMINISCENCE OF KANSAS PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting piece of information regarding the deal in\r\nKansas Pacific in the testimony of Mr. Artemus H. Holmes, formerly the\r\nattorney of that company, showing how the stock made a marvelous leap\r\nfrom two or three dollars to par in seven days. Mr. Holmes testified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    From 1873 to 1877 the market value of all the Kansas Pacific\r\n    securities was extremely low. The Kansas Pacific stock was $2 to\r\n    $3 a share and practically valueless. Land grant bonds were\r\n    worth 10 cents on the dollar, and Denver extension about 40, but\r\n    ranged from 50 to 70 in 1876 to 1878. The first mortgage bonds\r\n    were below par, the company’s credit was gone and the stock\r\n    unmarketable. Sidney Dillon, who was then President of the\r\n    Kansas Pacific Company, was anxious to have the matter settled\r\n    as quickly as possible. At the former’s suggestion a friendly\r\n    suit was brought on January 17, 1880, before Judge Donohue, in\r\n    the Supreme Court, in this city, to settle the ownership of the\r\n    Denver Pacific stock. The trustees said they could not do\r\n    anything with the stock that would injure it. On January 20,\r\n    1880, Horace M. Ruggles, as referee, heard argument, the case\r\n    was closed in two days, the decision was made January 23 and the\r\n    decree signed by Judge Donohue on January 24, giving the stock\r\n    to the Gould party. Mr. Holmes stated: “All the time this was\r\n    pending the articles of consolidation were being drawn up, but I\r\n    did not know anything about it until they were signed on January\r\n    24.” Referee Ruggles decided that 29,000 snares of Denver\r\n    Pacific stock free from mortgages should pass to the Kansas\r\n    Pacific. This was put into the Union Pacific and 29,000 shares\r\n    of the consolidated company’s stock given in exchange, which\r\n    sold at par. The witness was sharply questioned as to what he\r\n    knew about Referee Ruggles’ report. He was asked if he knew who\r\n    wrote the report, or had any knowledge as to who did.\r\n\r\n    Q. In order to prepare the decree which was signed on Jan. 24,\r\n    you must have had the finding before you, did you not? A. No.\r\n\r\n    Q. How could you prepare it without knowing what the finding\r\n    was, for the decree was presented the very next day? A. I must\r\n    withdraw that answer, and change it to yes.\r\n\r\n    Gov. Pattison—Do I understand you to say that the stock which\r\n    was exchanged had risen in a few days from $2 to $3 a share to\r\n    par. Mr. Holmes said that was a fact, and then this question was\r\n    put to him:\r\n\r\n    Q. In other words, Mr. Dillon had sworn on Jan. 17, 1880, that\r\n    the stock had no financial value, and yet on Jan. 24 it was\r\n    worth par. A. Yes.\r\n\r\nThis discloses another of Mr. Gould’s valuable secrets of the way to\r\nmake money rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GOULD’S FIRST YACHTING EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nThere is a humorous story told of Mr. Gould’s first yachting experience,\r\nwhich was recently published in the Philadelphia _Press_, and its\r\nveracity vouched for by a living witness to the event. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Gould in some special respects, and runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    At the residence of a club man, whose reputation as a\r\n    _raconteur_ is nearly as great as that of his Burgundy, I\r\n    noticed a pretty model of a jib and mainsail yacht. Replying to\r\n    my admiring inquiry the club man explained:\r\n\r\n    “That is the model of a boat upon which were passed some of the\r\n    sunniest hours of my life. She was owned by one of the Cruger\r\n    family, of Cruger-on-the-Hudson, and has an added interest from\r\n    the fact that upon her Jay Gould acquired his first yachting\r\n    experience, and so eventful a one that I’ll bet he remembers it\r\n    to this day.\r\n\r\n    “Crugers—one of the oldest and best known families in the State,\r\n    intermarried as they are with other Knickerbockers like the\r\n    Schuylers, Livingstons and Van Rensselaers—owned all the land in\r\n    the neighborhood of the station subsequently named after them. A\r\n    portion of this property consisted of a brick yard, which was\r\n    rented to the son of old Schuyler Livingston. It was in 1853 or\r\n    1854, and Jay Gould had just failed in the tannery business in\r\n    Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    “Young Livingston’s leased brick yard wasn’t paying, and he\r\n    concluded that it needed a shrewd business man at its head. He\r\n    advertised for a partner, and one day there appeared in response\r\n    a small, dark gentleman, looking scrupulously neat in his black\r\n    broadcloth. He gave his name as Jay Gould. Pending negotiations,\r\n    Mr. Gould became the guest of the Crugers at the old mansion on\r\n    the hill. Every effort was put forth to entertain him during his\r\n    stay, the more as he seemed to regard favorably a partnership\r\n    with their young friend.\r\n\r\n    “One day Mr. Cruger invited Gould to a sail to Newburgh, and got\r\n    ready his yacht, of which that model is the reduction. Several\r\n    of us youngsters were taken along to help work the boat. Eugene\r\n    Cruger, a nephew of the yacht’s owner, was one of us. Peekskill\r\n    was reached and the whole party went up to the hotel.\r\n\r\n    “All the way up the river we had noticed that Mr. Gould was\r\n    uneasy, shifting about constantly on the deck, where he sat, and\r\n    squirming and twisting as if seeking to find a softer spot.\r\n    Nothing was said about it, of course, but when we landed Mr.\r\n    Gould himself furnished the explanation. From the heat of the\r\n    sun the yellow paint on the boat’s deck had become baked and\r\n    chalky, and it was not long before the little man discovered\r\n    that the dry powder was coming off on his trousers. Hence his\r\n    uneasiness. He concluded by saying he was afraid his broadcloth\r\n    nether garments would be, if they were not already, ruined, and\r\n    was determined to abandon the trip and return by rail. This Mr.\r\n    Cruger would not hear of, and promised to obviate the\r\n    difficulty. We all adjourned to a general store and Cruger\r\n    bought, for two shillings and a half, a pair of jean overalls.\r\n    These Mr. Gould put on when we went aboard the boat and\r\n    expressed his unqualified satisfaction at the result.\r\n\r\n    “On our trip back from Newburgh we again called at Peekskill,\r\n    and once more the party started for the hotel. This time Mr.\r\n    Gould declined the invitation to take something and preferred to\r\n    remain on board. About an hour was spent in the hotel, when\r\n    suddenly Mr. Cruger remembered that he wanted some white lead,\r\n    and young Eugene Cruger and I went with him to the store to\r\n    carry it down to the boat.\r\n\r\n    “‘How’d the overalls work, Mr. Cruger?’ was the salutation of\r\n    the storekeeper. Then before answer could be returned, he added\r\n    admiringly: ‘That friend o’ yourn is purty shrewd.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Who, Mr. Gould? Yes, he appears to be a thorough business\r\n    man.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Well, I sh’d say so! He can drive a mighty sharp bargain.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Drive a sharp bargain?’ repeated Cruger, all at sea. ‘What do\r\n    you mean?’\r\n\r\n    “‘Why, don’t you know he was in here ’bout three quarters of an\r\n    hour ago, and sold me back the overalls you bought for him.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Thunder, no!’ roared Cruger in astonishment.\r\n\r\n    “‘Well, sir, he jest did that. He kem in here, tole me he’d no\r\n    fu’ther use for ’em, that they was as good as when I sold ’em,\r\n    an’ after we’d haggled awhile he ’greed ter take two shillin’\r\n    fur ’em, which I paid him. Here’s the overalls.’\r\n\r\n    “I can shut my eyes now,” went on the jolly club man, with a\r\n    hearty laugh, suiting the action to the words, “and call up Mr.\r\n    Cruger’s face with its mingled expression of amazement and\r\n    incredulity. He left the store in silence. Not until we had\r\n    nearly reached the boat did he speak. Then he only said, ‘Boys,\r\n    I’ll fix him for that?’ We reached home without any reference to\r\n    the incident. On the way back Mr. Gould sat upon his\r\n    pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n    “The same night Mr. Cruger perfected his plan. Next day Mr.\r\n    Cruger proposed a fishing party. Mr. Gould declined to go. He\r\n    had concluded, he said, not to take an interest in young\r\n    Livingston’s brickyard, and would return to the city on the\r\n    afternoon train. A business engagement, involving quite a sum of\r\n    money, had to be kept. His host argued with him, but for a time\r\n    to no purpose. The saturnine little man had a tremendous amount\r\n    of determination in his composition. Finally a compromise was\r\n    effected, it being agreed that he should put Gould off at a\r\n    station in time to catch the train. That he must catch it\r\n    without fail, he most emphatically declared.\r\n\r\n    “The day passed on and we were off Sing Sing, when we saw the\r\n    smoke of the coming train. We had been running free before the\r\n    wind, but immediately Mr. Cruger, who was at the stick, shoved\r\n    it down; we hauled in on the sheets and headed for the Eastern\r\n    shore. Mr. Gould was by this time on his feet, clinging to the\r\n    windward coaming, the deepest anxiety pictured on his face. Just\r\n    there the water shoals rapidly. We were within fifty feet of the\r\n    shore, opposite the railroad depot. The time had now come for\r\n    Mr. Cruger’s revenge.\r\n\r\n    “‘Let go the main and jib sheets!’ he shouted. ‘Down with your\r\n    board!’\r\n\r\n    “Never was order more eagerly obeyed. The sheets whizzed through\r\n    the blocks, ready hands slipped out the pin and jammed down the\r\n    centre-board, and in a second the yacht, with a grating shock\r\n    and shaking sails, came to a stand, fast on the sandy bottom.\r\n    There she was bound to stay until the obstructing board was\r\n    lifted again.\r\n\r\n    “‘What’s the matter?’ exclaimed Mr. Gould, anxiously. Of course\r\n    he had not detected the ruse, for he knew no more about the\r\n    working of a yacht than a sea cow does about differential\r\n    calculus.”\r\n\r\n    “‘I’m afraid we’re aground,’ replied Mr. Cruger, with a fine\r\n    assumption of sadness. ‘Boys, get out the sweeps and push her\r\n    off.’\r\n\r\n    “We struggled with the long oars in a great show of ardor, while\r\n    Gould watched us in breathless suspense, between hope and fear.\r\n    But as we had taken care to put the sweeps overboard astern, the\r\n    harder we shoved the faster we stuck. The little man’s\r\n    suspicions were not in the slightest degree aroused and he\r\n    turned in despair to Mr. Cruger.\r\n\r\n    “‘What shall I do!’ he almost wailed. ‘I’ve got to catch that\r\n    train!’\r\n\r\n    “‘Then,’ replied the joker, solemnly, ‘you’ll have to wade or\r\n    swim.’\r\n\r\n    “Already the train was in sight, two miles away, and whatever\r\n    was to be done had to be done quickly. As I have said, there was\r\n    plenty of grit in the embryo railroad king, and quick as a wink\r\n    he was out of his sable clothes and standing before us clad only\r\n    in his aggressively scarlet undergarments. Holding his precious\r\n    broadcloth suit above his head, he stepped into the water,\r\n    which, shallow as it was, reached to the armpits of the little\r\n    gentleman. Then he started for the shore, his short, thin legs\r\n    working back and forth in a most comical fashion as he strove to\r\n    quicken his pace. The station platform was crowded with people,\r\n    and very soon the strange figure approaching them was descried.\r\n    A peal of laughter from 500 throats rolled over the water to us,\r\n    the ladies hiding their blushes behind parasols and fans. The\r\n    men shouted with laughter. Finally the wader reached the base of\r\n    the stone wall, and for a moment covered with confusion—and but\r\n    little else—stood upon the rock, one scarlet leg uplifted,\r\n    looking for all the world like a flamingo on the shore of a\r\n    Florida bayou, while the air was split with shrieks of laughter,\r\n    in which we now unreservedly joined. Then came the climax of the\r\n    joke, which nearly paralyzed the unfortunate victim.\r\n\r\n    ‘Haul on your sheets, boys, and up with the board!’ was Cruger’s\r\n    order. As the yacht gathered headway and swept by within ten\r\n    feet of the astonished Mr. Gould, we laughingly bade him\r\n    good-bye, advising a warm mustard bath when he got home.\r\n\r\n    “Then his quick mind took in the full force of the practical\r\n    joke we had worked upon him and his dark face was a study for a\r\n    painter. But the train had already reached the station, taken on\r\n    its passengers and the wheels were beginning to turn again for\r\n    its run to the city. As Gould scrambled up the wall, his glossy\r\n    black suit still pressed affectionately to his bosom, the ‘All\r\n    aboard!’ had sounded and the cars were moving. Every window was\r\n    filled with laughing faces as he raced over the sand and stones\r\n    and was dragged by two brakemen on to the rear platform, panting\r\n    and dripping. The last glimpse we caught of him was as the train\r\n    entered the prison tunnel. Then, supported on either side by the\r\n    railroad men, he was making frantic plunges in his efforts to\r\n    thrust his streaming legs into his trousers as the platform\r\n    reeled and rocked beneath him.”\r\n\r\n    “Did he ever return Mr. Cruger the two shillings?” the writer\r\n    inquired.\r\n\r\n    “Return the two shillings!” echoed the club man. For a moment he\r\n    was silent. Then, as a retrospective gleam crept into his eyes,\r\n    he slowly shook his head and, with seeming irrelevancy, said:\r\n\r\n    “I—guess—you—are—not—very—well—acquainted—with—Mr.—Jay—Gould.”\r\n\r\n    The above story was submitted to Mr. Eugene Cruger at his\r\n    residence, No. 1211 Livingston Avenue, together with the inquiry\r\n    as to its accuracy. Mr. Cruger made the following reply: “I must\r\n    say that I can’t imagine who can have furnished these\r\n    particulars, for most of those who took part in the incidents\r\n    related have gone forever. Whoever the informant may be,\r\n    however, it cannot be denied that you have received a true\r\n    account of what occurred. I enjoyed the affair at that period,\r\n    but time has softened things and the recollection is not without\r\n    its unpleasant side.”\r\n\r\nThe success of Mr. Gould in securing the Baltimore and Ohio Telegraph to\r\nbe consolidated with Western Union, has placed him at the head of the\r\ngreatest telegraph monopoly in the world, practically beyond\r\ncompetition. It remains to be seen whether or not Congress will take any\r\naction towards the creation of a Government telegraph that will afford a\r\nguarantee of protection against extortionate rates. It is true that\r\nWestern Union has lowered its rates, but this is generally regarded as a\r\nconciliatory move of a temporary character on the part of Mr. Gould for\r\nthe purpose of showing that Government telegraphy is not a necessity,\r\nand that as soon as the attention of Congress is turned away from the\r\nquestion rates will go up again.\r\n\r\nWhile I should not approve of the Government going so far as to condemn\r\nWestern Union property, and making a purchase thereof on an appraised\r\nvaluation, still I do believe that proper Congressional action should be\r\ntaken to provide supervision and protective control over the telegraphic\r\ncommunication throughout the country. My idea is that the Government\r\nshould interfere rather as a regulator than an owner, being careful to\r\navoid everything that could be construed into monopoly on its own part,\r\nany more than in connection with our railroad system.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould went to Europe late in the fall, and visited several places\r\nthere ostensibly for health, pleasure, and recreation. What his secret\r\nand ultimate designs may be has not yet transpired, although they have\r\nbeen a leading topic of much conjecture among financiers and Wall Street\r\nmagnates since his arrival on the other side. One of the best things got\r\noff on this subject was, that when Mr. Gould sent in his card to one of\r\nthe Rothschilds, the latter requested the messenger to inform the\r\ngentleman that Europe was not for sale.\r\n\r\nHe returned about the end of March to find some of his railroads,\r\nespecially in Missouri Pacific system, in a somewhat crippled condition.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of deep humility that I have made many important\r\nomissions in Mr. Gould’s variegated career, although I have surrendered\r\nall the space to him that I can very well afford, I now beg to take my\r\nleave of him, at least so far as the present edition is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Cyrus W.

FIELD.\r\n\r\nCyrus W. Field has been termed a locomotive in trousers. The simile\r\nillustrates the indefatigable energy of the man. His indomitable\r\nresolution and his energy of character have placed him high among the\r\ndistinguished men of the age. He was born at Stockbridge, Mass., in\r\n1819. His father was a clergyman. At fifteen years of age, Cyrus W.\r\nField came to New York with a trifling sum in his pocket. For three\r\nyears he was in the employ of A. T. Stewart, the dry goods merchant, and\r\nthen went to Lee, Mass., to work in his brother’s paper mill. Two years\r\nlater he became a partner in the paper firm of E. Root & Co., in Maiden\r\nLane, but the co-partnership was not successful. Later on he again went\r\ninto the paper business, and by 1853 had acquired a competence,\r\nwhereupon he partially withdrew from mercantile pursuits, and his health\r\nhaving failed he took a trip to South America. He was about to withdraw\r\nentirely from business, when he was induced, with considerable\r\ndifficulty, to look into a project for laying a telegraphic cable to\r\nEngland. Frederick N. Gisbourne had interested Matthew D. Field, a civil\r\nengineer, and a brother of Cyrus W. Field, in a project for establishing\r\na telegraph line between New York and St. John’s, Newfoundland, partly\r\non poles, partly under ground, and partly under water. At St. John’s,\r\nthe fastest steamers ever built were to sail for Ireland, and the time\r\nbetween the two countries was to be shortened to six days or less. A\r\ncompany had attempted to carry out this project, and had become\r\nbankrupt. The idea was un-American; it was unsatisfactory; much quicker\r\ncommunication was needed. It was not till Mr. Field conceived the idea\r\nof laying a cable direct from Newfoundland to Ireland, that he became\r\nreally interested in the enterprise. He was assured by high scientific\r\nauthority that the idea could be carried out. In March, 1854, Mr. Field\r\nwent to St. John’s, Newfoundland, and obtained from the legislature a\r\ncharter, granting an exclusive right for fifty years, to establish a\r\ntelegraph line from the Continent of America to Newfoundland and thence\r\nto Europe. Then, with considerable difficulty, he obtained in New York\r\nsubscriptions amounting to $1,500,000, which he thought would be\r\nsufficient. The line really cost $1,834,500, being more than 2,600 miles\r\nlong. His first attempt failed in 1857. He succeeded in the following\r\nyear, and then the cable became silent, and the incredulous public\r\nthought that this would end all attempts to do something that seemed\r\nmiraculous. For seven years no attempt was made to lay a cable, as the\r\nCivil War intervened, but in 1865 Mr. Field again took up the\r\nenterprise, in which he had never lost faith. By this time sub-marine\r\ntelegraphy had been greatly improved, a better cable was constructed,\r\nand a better machine for laying it was invented. The famous steamer\r\n_Great Eastern_ took the cable, but after going some 1,200 miles, the\r\ngreat vessel gave a lurch that broke the cable and an attempt to grapple\r\nit was unsuccessful. In 1866, however, a cable was successfully laid. A\r\nprivate citizen seldom receives such honors as was showered on Mr.\r\nField, in 1866, when Europe and America realized that largely through\r\nthe exertions of one man, they were joined by the Atlantic cable. He had\r\npushed a vast project to a successful consummation in spite of\r\nincredulity, ridicule, indifference and strenuous opposition.\r\n\r\nPeter the Hermit did not preach the crusade with more fervor and\r\nenthusiasm than this priest of commerce, so to speak, advocated the\r\ngreat work with which history will always link his name. If any one had,\r\na few centuries ago, ventured to predict that the day would come when\r\nthere would be six or seven cable telegraphs stretched along the ocean\r\nbed between America and Europe—along dim prehistoric valleys, four miles\r\nunder water and over great sub-marine mountains—by means of which a\r\nmessage could be sent nearly three thousand miles and an answer received\r\nin thirty seconds; he would have been in danger of incarceration as a\r\nlunatic, or even of death on the scaffold or at the stake. This daring\r\nutilitarian age, however, has grown accustomed to startling exhibitions\r\nof human ingenuity. Mr. Field owns considerable Western Union stock, and\r\nis interested in a number of railroads, including the Manhattan\r\nElevated. He owns one-fifth of the stock of the Acadia Coal Co., is a\r\nspecial partner in the grain firm of Field, Lindley & Co., and owns the\r\n_Mail and Express_, one of the great papers of the metropolis. He has a\r\nhouse in Gramercy Park and a fine mansion at Irvington on an estate of\r\nabout 500 acres. He is a large owner of real estate in that very\r\npleasant section, owning some 56 houses besides considerable land. He is\r\nfully six feet in height, of light complexion, with penetrating,\r\nbluish-gray eyes, which peer sharply into those of an interlocutor. The\r\nnose is prominent, the brows knit with years of thought, the mouth and\r\njaw indicate great decision of character. He is a man of courtly manners\r\nand exceptional abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Philip D Armour_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HON. STEPHEN V. WHITE.\r\n\r\nHon. Stephen V. White is a short, compactly built, dark-complexioned man\r\nof 54. In manners he is courteous and unassuming; in business methods he\r\nis quick and straightforward. He is a Director in the Western Union and\r\nthe Lackawanna road. He is a bold, dashing operator in stocks, and in\r\nWall Street has met with considerable success. One of his greatest\r\nfavorites is Lackawanna. He expects to see it some day go to 200. He has\r\nseveral times badly squeezed the shorts in that stock, and, now that he\r\nhas practically demonstrated what they ought to have known before,\r\nnamely, that the stock can easily be cornered, the bears are apt to\r\nfight shy of it. He has a large _clientele_, and, being a natural\r\nleader, he has plenty of followers in his speculative campaigns. He was\r\nborn in North Carolina. He was graduated from Knox College at Galesburg,\r\nIllinois. He studied law in the office of the Hon. John J. Kasson,\r\nafterward United States Minister to Germany. He drifted to St. Louis,\r\nand there became a reporter for the Missouri _Democrat_. He went to Des\r\nMoines, practised law for nine years, and was elected a Judge. He came\r\nto New York, and for a time practised law, but soon became a stock\r\nbroker as well. He still occasionally appears as counsel in the Federal\r\nCourts, and sometimes in the Supreme Court of the United States. He is a\r\nready and forcible speaker, full of vim and fire. He was a warm personal\r\nfriend of the late Henry Ward Beecher, the grand old Chrysostom of the\r\nnineteenth century, who has left the world brighter for his memory and\r\ndarker for his absence. In the frank, keen, practical financier and\r\nlawyer, and the great, warm hearted preacher, glowing with fervid\r\nidealism and generous enthusiasm and high aspirations for the human\r\nrace, there were kindred qualities that made them friends. Mr. White, in\r\n1886, was elected to Congress from Brooklyn, where he resides. He is\r\nscholarly in his tastes, well versed in the classics, and is especially\r\nfond of astronomy, for the study of which he has a fine observatory in\r\nhis palatial home. He is popular in Wall Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _L. P.

He is by nature the\r\nreverse of an iconoclast, namely, a builder up. He would construct\r\nrather than destroy. He would save a property if it were at all\r\npossible, and in pulling that poor, tired, financial pilgrim Reading out\r\nof the slough of despond, and in directing its way toward a primrose\r\npath of prosperity, he is engaged in a congenial task. He is about 58\r\nyears of age, and was born in Newport, New Hampshire. He studied law,\r\nand was graduated from the Harvard Law School. For a time he practised\r\nlaw in his native town as a partner of Ex-Governor Metcalf, of New\r\nHampshire, but in 1851 he went to Davenport, Iowa. There he really\r\norganized the first national bank under the new system, which was to\r\nprove of such incalculable financial benefit to the nation. Mr. Corbin\r\nmade the first application under the new law, but it happened to be\r\nfaulty in some minor technicalities, and before their trivialities could\r\nbe corrected four other national banks were organized, so that his bank\r\nbecame number five under the new system. He came to New York in 1865,\r\nand established a banking-house here. He is President of the Reading,\r\nLong Island, Indiana, Bloomington & Western, Elmira, Cortland &\r\nNorthern, and Manhattan Beach Railroads. He is a member of the Union\r\nLeague, Manhattan and Saturday Night Clubs of New York, the Somerset\r\nClub of Boston, and the Conservative Club of London. He is a man of\r\nstrict probity, genial in his manners, and deservedly held in high\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n                           PHILIP D. ARMOUR.\r\n\r\nPhilip D. Armour was born in a little village near Watertown in the\r\ninterior of New York State, in 1832. He is powerfully built, with broad\r\nshoulders, a large head and firm, square features and light gray eyes,\r\nthat never seem excited or disturbed. His manners are quiet, composed\r\nand courteous. In 1849, leaving his native village, he went to\r\nCalifornia. He crossed the plains with a six-mule team which he drove\r\nhimself. He worked for a few years in the gold fields, accumulated a\r\nlittle capital, and in 1855 went to Milwaukee and engaged in the grain\r\nand warehouse business. He prospered moderately but steadily. Then he\r\nthought of going into the lumber business, but bought an interest in the\r\npork packing establishment of Layton & Plankington, the former retiring.\r\nAt this time he was worth half a million. He soon increased this\r\nthree-fold. In the war, provisions were very high, but when Gen. Grant\r\nwas closing in on the Confederacy for the final struggle that could only\r\nend in the triumph of the North, Mr. Armour saw that prices must come\r\ndown with the Confederacy. He came at once to New York and began to sell\r\npork short. He began to sell at $40 a barrel. He covered at $18 and\r\nnetted, it is said, nearly two million dollars. He now enlarged his\r\nbusiness, established new packing houses in Chicago and Kansas City as\r\nwell as agencies all over the world. He has sold sixty million dollars’\r\nworth of food products in a year. He has five thousand names on his pay\r\nroll. He has cornered pork three times within recent years, and in 1880\r\nmade, it is said, three millions in punishing bears who tried to sell\r\nthe market down. A campaign against the bears in pork or meats he calls\r\nprotecting his cellars. Those cellars are well protected. No bearish Ali\r\nBaba has the pass-word to go in and plunder them, and the number of\r\ncinnamons and grizzlies, big and little, who have licked their paws in\r\nrueful remembrance of the attempt are not a few. He has made millions in\r\nsuccessful grain speculations. He invested four millions in St. Paul\r\nstock, buying it outright. He is now one of the recognized financial\r\nleaders of the country, as aggressive as a Wellington at the proper time\r\nand cautious as a Fabius when caution is the watchword of wisdom. He\r\nlives in a plain house on Prairie Avenue in Chicago, and is himself a\r\nman devoid of ostentation. He works from 7 A. M. till 6 P. M. His\r\nfortune is estimated at fifteen millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nHon. Levi P. Morton received his business training in the dry goods\r\ntrade. Then he became a banker. He has a national reputation as a\r\nfinancier. He is shrewd, genial and successful. President Garfield made\r\nhim Minister to France. He had previously done good service as a member\r\nof Congress. He is now in his sixty-third year. He is a lineal\r\ndescendant of George Morton, one of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to this\r\ncountry in 1623. Mr. Morton was born in the State of New Hampshire. At\r\n20 he became a clerk in a country store. He had to shift for himself.\r\nNecessity is the stimulus that men of real ability require. He stayed\r\nfive years in the obscure New Hampshire village and then went to Boston,\r\nwhere he ultimately engaged in business. But New York attracted him. He\r\nembarked in the dry goods business here and went into banking\r\nafterwards, and soon laid the broad foundations for the successful firms\r\nof Morton, Bliss & Co., of New York, and Morton, Rose & Co., of London.\r\nHis Congressional and diplomatic laurels followed. He filled the French\r\nMission with great satisfaction to the French people as well as those of\r\nthe American traveling public, as he was a free and generous\r\nentertainer. His large fortune has been amassed since he came to Wall\r\nStreet. He has a fine villa at Newport and also one on the Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _John A Stewart_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN A. STEWART.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Stewart is President of the United States Trust Company, one of\r\nthe largest banking and trust corporations in America. Its deposits are\r\nover forty millions of dollars. Its great success is largely due to the\r\nable management of President Stewart, who has in fact shown marvellous\r\nability in the management of large financial interests. Mr. Stewart\r\nduring the war period was urged by Secretary Chase to became\r\nSub-Treasurer of the United States in this city, and he finally\r\nconsented to take the position, although at a great personal sacrifice,\r\nbeing actuated solely by a patriotic spirit. He is one of the financial\r\nlights of the metropolis, and is respected for his financial acumen and\r\nhis sterling qualities as a man.\r\n\r\n                           ANTHONY J. DREXEL.\r\n\r\nAnthony J. Drexel is the head of the house of Drexel & Co. in\r\nPhiladelphia and Drexel, Morgan & Co. in New York. The house was founded\r\nby Joseph Drexel, who emigrated to this country from Germany early in\r\nthe present century, and began business in Philadelphia in a small way\r\nas a sort of exchange broker. When the California gold fever broke out\r\nhe made connections with parties in San Francisco and received large\r\namounts of gold. In these transactions he got his first great start. The\r\nreturns from the exchange were large. As his means increased he\r\ngradually extended his business, and finally, by thrift and diligent\r\nattention to business, he accumulated quite a snug fortune. In the end\r\nhe built up a successful banking business, in which his sons became\r\ninterested, and at his death inherited his wealth and the business. The\r\nelder brother died a few years ago, leaving ten million dollars to his\r\nfamily and to various charities. Anthony Drexel, the present head of\r\nthis signally successful firm, is 55 years of age, and is a man of\r\nexcellent business capacity. He is one of the successful business men of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n                          THE JEROME BROTHERS.\r\n\r\nAddison Jerome, who died some years ago, was a gigantic operator in his\r\nday, and displayed great ability in the conduct of speculative\r\ncampaigns, but he went beyond his depth and disaster followed. Like many\r\nothers in Wall Street, he gained his business education in the dry goods\r\ntrade. He met with one of his greatest reverses in his attempt to corner\r\nLake Shore. Others followed, one after another, and the end was\r\nfinancial shipwreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANTHONY J. DREXEL.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _yours truly\r\n  Leonard W Jerome_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time his brother, Leonard W. Jerome, was one of the foremost men\r\nof Wall Street and was a partner of Wm. R. Travers, the firm name being\r\nTravers & Jerome. Leonard Jerome is splendidly built and nearly six feet\r\nin height. His ancestors were Huguenots. He was born in Pompey, Onondaga\r\ncounty, New York. His grandfather was a Presbyterian clergyman. At 14\r\nLeonard was sent to Princeton College and was graduated with credit. He\r\nthen spent three years reading law in Albany, and at 22 was admitted to\r\nthe bar. He practiced law with his uncle, Judge Jerome, of Rochester.\r\nAfterward with his brother Lawrence he established a newspaper, called\r\nthe _Rochester Native American_, and he made a good editor. President\r\nFilmore appointed him Consul at Trieste. He came to Wall Street in 1854.\r\nHis first operation was in putting up all he could spare, about two\r\nthousand dollars, as margin on five hundred shares of Cleveland and\r\nToledo stock, one of the old-time speculative favorites. He bought it on\r\na sure point from the treasurer of the road. He bought. The treasurer\r\nsold. Result: The stock fell, and Jerome lost all his spare funds. He\r\nwas not discouraged. He studied Wall Street tactics, and in the end he\r\nmade the treasurer pay dearly for his former success in spearing a lamb.\r\nHe invested $500 in buying calls and made $5,000 within thirty days. He\r\nbecame a partner of William R. Travers. They were very successful on the\r\nshort side of the market. He was to meet with some reverses, however. In\r\n1862 the agent of the State of Indiana, in a manner that would have\r\ndeceived the very elect, through an unauthorized issue of Indiana 5 per\r\ncent. bonds, swindled him out of $600,000 by the hypothecation of the\r\nbonds. The State repudiated the acts of its agent, and as an individual\r\nis not allowed to sue a State, Mr. Jerome was robbed of the money. Still\r\nanother reverse was met in Pacific Mail. When the capital stock was\r\nincreased to $20,000,000 he took 50,000 shares at 200. The price\r\nadvanced soon thereafter to 243, and he sold a part of his stock, but\r\nkept a large block of it on account of his faith in its value. At the\r\nnext quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors, however, it was\r\ndecided by a majority of one, five directors being present, to reduce\r\nthe dividend from five to three per cent. The street was thunderstruck\r\nat the audacity of this move; the market broke, and in two hours Mr.\r\nJerome’s stock depreciated $800,000. Still he made large gains in\r\nPacific Mail as well as big losses. He left Wall Street years ago with\r\nan ample fortune. He went there with next to nothing, and in spite of\r\nreverses, came out a substantial victor in the financial tourney. In the\r\nwar he was always enthusiastic in his devotion to the cause of the\r\nNorth, and subscribed with princely liberality to aid patriotic\r\nmovements. When the first great Union meeting was held at the Academy of\r\nMusic he paid all the expenses. He was Treasurer of the Union Defense\r\nCommittee, and he likewise paid all of its incidental expenses. He was\r\nthe most liberal in his contributions and the most devoted in his\r\nallegiance to the Government in its darkest and gloomiest hours. He was\r\nthe founder of the fund for the benefit of the families of those who\r\nwere killed or wounded in the New York riots of 1863, growing out of the\r\ndraft. His checks for $10,000 and more to aid the Union arms were\r\nfrequent; he contributed $35,000 toward the construction of the\r\n“Meteor,” a war vessel built to destroy the famous “Alabama” of the\r\nConfederacy. During the war Mr. Jerome purchased and held for some years\r\nthe largest interest in the _New York Times_, then edited by the great\r\nwar editor, Henry J. Raymond, an old friend of Mr. Jerome’s. Like Mr.\r\nTravers, his early partner, Mr. Jerome has done much to encourage all\r\nout-of-door sports, especially on the race course. He established the\r\nJerome Park Jockey Club, and became half owner in a famous speed horse\r\nwhich cost $40,000. No one has done more to improve the breed of blooded\r\nhorses in this country than Mr. Jerome. He has also been prominent in\r\nyachting. He first owned the “Undine”; then, with Commodore McVickar, he\r\nbought the “Restless,” and still later, with Commodore James Gordon\r\nBennett, the “Dauntless.” He paid $125,000 for the steam yacht “Clara\r\nClarita,” which proved a failure, and since then he has not been so\r\nenthusiastic a yachtsman as formerly. He made $45,000 on the great ocean\r\nyacht race of 1866. He had much to do with introducing the taste for\r\nfour-in-hands in this country. He has been a liberal patron of American\r\nart in all its branches. He paid for the musical education of a number\r\nof well-known singers, whose voices were trained in the best Italian\r\nschools. His social position has always been high, but it has been still\r\nfurther promoted by the marriages of his beautiful daughters. The elder,\r\nClara, is married to Mr. Morton Frewen, a member of an old English\r\nfamily which long represented their shire in Parliament. Another, Leoni,\r\nmarried Mr. John Leslie of the Guards, and son and heir of Sir John\r\nLeslie; while Jennie married Lord Randolph Churchill, the notable but\r\nerratic statesman. Leonard W. Jerome, whose history I have followed\r\nsomewhat minutely, is one of the best-hearted men that Wall Street ever\r\nknew. The more he made the more he gave. He was liberal to a fault. He\r\nwas never happy but when making others happy. He was a Sir Philip Sidney\r\nof chivalry and peerless generosity—a man in whom the warmest and most\r\ningratiating traits of human nature were as natural as the winning\r\nsunniness of his disposition and the courage which once made him one of\r\nthe great gladiators in the arena of Wall Street. Both he and his\r\nbrother Lawrence are old members of the Union Club. Lawrence was\r\nformerly a stock broker. He had his ups and downs, and withdrew from\r\nWall Street several years ago. He sold his seat in the Stock Exchange\r\nand placed the proceeds, about $30,000, in an annuity which insures him\r\nabout $4,000 a year for the remainder of his life. This, with his other\r\nincome, places him in easy circumstances and preserves his naturally\r\ncheerful disposition, rendering him one of the most companionable men in\r\nthe city. He is about five feet ten inches in height, stout and of light\r\ncomplexion. Since the death of his old friend, Wm. R. Travers, to whom\r\nhe was as Damon to Pythias, he stands pre-eminent among the wits of New\r\nYork. He is the prince of metropolitan wags and wits. His friends are\r\nlegion. The great, genial, warm hearted, boyish Larry Jerome, as his\r\nfriends love to call him, is literally a man without an enemy, and long\r\nmay he live to brighten society with his happy exuberance of spirits,\r\nhis scintillating humor and his brilliant wit.\r\n\r\n                            ADDISON CAMMACK.\r\n\r\nAddison Cammack is about sixty years of age and was born in\r\nHopkinsville, Kentucky. He was reared in comfortable but humble\r\ncircumstances. Early in life he began his business career as a clerk in\r\nthe house of J. P. Whitney & Co., then the largest ship brokers in New\r\nOrleans. He showed decided business talent, and ultimately became a\r\npartner in the firm. In the early part of the Civil War he was located\r\nin Havana, but in 1863 he went to London and and engaged in business and\r\nspeculation there. He returned to this country in two years, and in 1866\r\nembarked in the wholesale liquor business in New York with J. W. George,\r\nthe firm being J. W. George & Co. In about two years the firm was\r\ndissolved and Mr. Cammack became a member of the Stock Exchange, having\r\npreviously formed a co-partnership with the late Chas. J. Osborn, under\r\nthe name of Osborn & Cammack. This co-partnership, after some years of\r\ngreat prosperity, was dissolved, and since then Mr. Cammack has been an\r\noperator on his own account. In this capacity he has become widely\r\nknown. He is a shrewd operator, and quickly changes his mind if he\r\nthinks he has been wrong. He jumps from one side of the market to the\r\nother with the greatest celerity when occasion demands it, but in the\r\nmain he seems most at home on the bear side. In bear operations he has\r\nmet with some reverses, while in this direction he has also made\r\nmillions. He seems to place great faith in Benner’s book of “Financial\r\nProphecies.” At times he operates on a very large scale, and he has been\r\nknown to cover fifty thousand shares of stock in a single day. He is\r\ntall, well built, and has strong features, with keen, gray eyes. In\r\nmanners he is very democratic and candid, and occasionally somewhat\r\nbluff; but he is a man of generous impulses, very charitable, and has\r\nplenty of friends, both for his financial acumen and for his qualities\r\nas a man who never deserts his friends, and who has not a few of the\r\ncharacteristics of mediæval chivalry joined to the shrewd practicality\r\nof a great stock operator of this practical epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Very Respectfully\r\n  Addison Cammack_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RUSSELL SAGE.\r\n\r\nRussell Sage is one of the best known of Wall Street celebrities. He was\r\nborn seventy years ago in Oneida county, of this State. As a boy, he was\r\nemployed in a country general store, beginning life in this fashion at\r\n14. His business aptitude early manifested itself, and at 20 he bought\r\nout his employer in Troy, to which he had in the meantime removed. He\r\nbecame later on a member of the Troy Board of Aldermen, served seven\r\nyears, and was then elected Treasurer. Still later he was elected to\r\nCongress, serving from 1853 to 1857. He started the project of\r\npurchasing Mount Vernon and making it a national domain, and took great\r\npride in the success which attended his efforts in this direction. While\r\nin Congress he became connected with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,\r\nand later Vice-President of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, also for\r\na time its acting president. He is now a director in the Gould telegraph\r\nand railroad systems, is interested in a number of trust companies and\r\nis also said to own a large amount of stock in the Importers’ and\r\nTraders’ Bank. He is the king of puts and calls. He has usually been\r\nsuccessful in writing privileges, but in the summer of 1884, when the\r\nmarket broke so badly as to produce a panic, Mr. Sage met with a decided\r\nreverse. He had sold a large number of puts, and the loss was several\r\nmillion dollars. He is known as, in one sense, the largest capitalist of\r\nWall Street, inasmuch as he keeps the largest cash balance. It runs far\r\nup in the millions, giving him quick resources with which to carry out\r\nany project that may seem desirable. He is quiet and simple in his\r\nhabits, making no display. He lives on Fifth Avenue, and also has a\r\nplace at Babylon, Long Island. He is worth about twenty millions. He is\r\ntall, light complexioned, with keen, gray eyes, and in Wall Street might\r\nbe taken for a country gentleman seeing the sights.\r\n\r\n                           CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW.\r\n\r\nChauncey M. Depew owes his rise to native abilities and the friendship\r\nof the Vanderbilt family, which he has thoroughly merited. He made the\r\nacquaintance of Wm. H. Vanderbilt about the year 1866 and became the\r\nattorney of the New York and Harlem Railroad. On the union of the New\r\nYork Central and Harlem roads, in 1869, he was appointed attorney of the\r\nconsolidated company, and in 1875 he was made general counsel. A few\r\nyears previous he had been elected director of the New York Central\r\nroad, and subsequently became a director in the Chicago and\r\nNorthwestern, Michigan Central, St. Paul and Omaha, the Lake Shore and\r\nthe Nickel Plate. In 1882 he was elected second vice-president of the\r\nNew York Central, and in 1885 succeeded Mr. Rutter as president of that\r\ngreat railroad. He was born in Peekskill in 1834, and comes of an old\r\nFrench Huguenot family. He still owns the homestead purchased two\r\nhundred years ago by his ancestors. His mother is a descendant of the\r\nbrother of Roger Sherman, of revolutionary fame. Mr. Depew was graduated\r\nfrom Yale College in 1856, and three years later was admitted to the\r\nbar. In 1862 he was elected to the New York Assembly and acted as\r\nChairman of the Committee of Ways and Means and part of the time as\r\nSpeaker. In 1863, the year after Governor Seymour’s election, Mr. Depew\r\nwas a candidate for Secretary of State on the Republican ticket,\r\novercame the Democratic ascendancy, and was elected by about thirty\r\nthousand votes. He declined re-election and was appointed Minister to\r\nJapan by Secretary Seward. He held the post several years, and resigned\r\nit to resume business. His commission as Collector of the Port of New\r\nYork was once made out by President Johnson, but in consequence of\r\nSenator E. D. Morgan’s refusal to sustain Mr. Johnson’s veto of the\r\nCivil Rights bill the President never sent the nomination to the Senate,\r\nbut tore it up in a rage. In 1872 Mr. Depew was a candidate for\r\nLieutenant-Governor of New York on the Liberal-Republican ticket, and\r\nwas defeated. Two years later the Legislature elected him Regent of the\r\nState University. He served one year as one of the Commissioners to\r\nbuild the new Capitol at Albany. In the memorable contest for the United\r\nStates Senatorship in 1881, Mr. Depew for eighty-two days received the\r\nvotes of three-fourths of the Republican members, retiring then to\r\nensure the election of Warner Miller. Mr. Depew is President of the\r\nUnion League and a member of many other clubs and societies, and is very\r\npopular wherever he is known. He is one of the wittiest and readiest\r\nafter-dinner speakers in this country, and when occasion requires, rises\r\nto the height of a born orator. His tastes seem to be those of a\r\nstatesman and a scholar rather than those of a financier in the ordinary\r\nacceptation of the term, but his conservative and able administration of\r\nhis office as President of one of the greatest trunk lines in this\r\ncountry, reveals a thorough apprehension of railroad problems and a\r\nnatural capacity for whatever duties may be imposed upon him. His great\r\nversatility is exemplified by the fact that he has succeeded in law,\r\npolitics and railroad management.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Russell Sage_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JAMES M. BROWN.\r\n\r\nJames M. Brown, the banker, was born in New York city, and is about 65\r\nyears of age. He is ex-President of the Chamber of Commerce, and is held\r\nin general esteem and respect. The house of Brown Bros. & Co., in which\r\nhe is now the senior member, has an interesting history. Early in the\r\npresent century Alexander Brown came from Belfast, Ireland, to this\r\ncountry, and settled in Baltimore, where he engaged in the dry goods\r\nbusiness under the firm name of Alexander Brown & Sons. Subsequently the\r\nfirm comprised five sons of Alexander Brown. The business of the dry\r\ngoods firm prospered, and branch houses were established in\r\nPhiladelphia, New York and Liverpool, a son going to each of these\r\ncities to represent the parent house in Baltimore. In New York and\r\nPhiladelphia the style of the firm was Brown Brothers & Co., as the\r\nfather had died in the meantime. In Liverpool they associated with them\r\nMr. Shipley, and the firm there was Brown, Shipley & Co. Another house\r\nwas established in London later on under the same title as the Liverpool\r\nfirm. All the houses were still engaged in the dry goods trade. Here in\r\nNew York, in which we are more particularly interested, the firm made\r\nadvances on cotton, and received linens from abroad, and also orders to\r\nbuy cotton for Liverpool. Gradually the house began to make larger\r\nadvances to planters and others engaged in the cotton trade, and finally\r\nthe banking business became so large as to swallow up the dry goods\r\ntrade and the house thereupon dropped merchandise and became bankers.\r\nLater on a branch house was established in Boston, and at times it has\r\nhad branch houses in New Orleans, Mobile, Galveston, Savannah and\r\nCharleston conducted under the name of the parent firm. At present it\r\nhas houses in London, Liverpool, New York, Philadelphia, Boston,\r\nBaltimore and New Orleans. All of the original Brown brothers are dead.\r\nJames M. Brown is a near relative of James Brown, whose picture appears,\r\nand who was the original head of the house in New York. James M. Brown\r\ndid not enter the house in his youth. He was for years the senior member\r\nof the dry goods house of Brown, Seaver & Dunbar. On the dissolution of\r\nthis firm James M. Brown became a partner in the house of which, by\r\nreason of his years and large experience, he may be considered the head.\r\nThe other partners here are Howard Potter, John Crosby Brown, Charles D.\r\nDickey, Waldron Post Brown, a son of James M. Brown, and W. F. Halsey.\r\nThe New York partners are interested in the branch houses in this\r\ncountry and abroad. James M. Brown was a member of the famous Committee\r\nof Seventy which contributed to the downfall of the Tweed Ring in this\r\ncity. He is of the medium height and florid complexion, well preserved,\r\ngenial in manners, and is a man of high character.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Yours Very Truly.\r\n  Chauncey M. Depew._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    STEDMAN, THE POET AND FINANCIER.\r\n\r\nA small, slightly built gentleman with iron gray side whiskers, a\r\nrefined face and expressive gray eyes, is one of the notable figures in\r\nWall Street. It is Edmund Clarence Stedman, the banker poet. He was born\r\nin a small town in Connecticut in 1833, studied at Yale, entered\r\njournalism in 1852, came to New York in 1855, and soon began to\r\ncontribute poems to the _New York Tribune_. He became a war\r\ncorrespondent for the _World_ on the outbreak of the rebellion, and\r\ncontinued in this capacity till 1863. In that year he became private\r\nsecretary to Attorney-General Bates at Washington. Meantime he studied\r\nlaw, and contributed to the _Atlantic Monthly_ and other leading\r\nmagazines. As a poet, he holds high rank; as a writer of polished,\r\ngraceful prose he has few equals; as a thorough gentleman and a\r\nscrupulous man of business he is held in the highest respect. Through\r\nthe imprudence of another he has within a few years met with some\r\nfinancial reverses, which he met courageously and honorably, and he is\r\nnow well on his way towards his former position of financial ease.\r\nAlthough a poet, he understands Wall Street business thoroughly, and is\r\nconsidered a keen judge of financial opportunities.\r\n\r\nVictor H. Newcombe was born in Louisville, Kentucky, about 48 years ago.\r\nHis father was President of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, and the\r\nson succeeded the father in that position. The elder Newcombe was a\r\nfinancial power in Kentucky. He was sagacious and far-seeing. In every\r\nrespect, he was an excellent business man. Victor Newcombe has fallen\r\nheir to his father’s laurels and is a successful operator in Wall\r\nStreet. He has achieved signal success in most of the campaigns in which\r\nhe has engaged, whether on the bull or the bear side of the market. He\r\nis cautious, and turns quickly when he thinks there is occasion. He\r\nseems to act on the French saying, that “only a fool never changes his\r\nmind.” He lives in fine style on Fifth avenue, and also has a beautiful\r\nresidence at Elberon. He is one of a number of prominent gentlemen from\r\nthe South who have enrolled themselves among the citizens and taxpayers\r\nof New York. He is an ex-director in the New York & New England road,\r\nand a prominent member of the Union and Tuxedo Park Clubs.\r\n\r\n                             MOSES TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nMoses Taylor, now deceased, was one of the notable figures in Wall\r\nStreet life for many years. He started as a South street merchant, after\r\nhaving been a clerk with G. G. & S. Howland. Wm. H. Aspinwall was also a\r\nclerk with that house at the same time. When Mr. Taylor gave up his\r\nsituation to embark in business for himself, Mr. Aspinwall was admitted\r\ninto the Howland firm as a junior partner. Moses Taylor was a man\r\ngoverned largely by intuition. There was little argument; with him, so\r\nto speak, it was a word and a blow. Having formed his impression and\r\ntaken his quick resolution, there was no length to which he would not go\r\nin the transaction, either in buying or selling or advancing money. He\r\nwas President of the City Bank and owned a large amount of its stock.\r\nUnder his administration the bank was wonderfully successful. His\r\nson-in-law Percy R. Pyne, is now its President. Moses Taylor was a\r\nvaluable aid to the Union cause during the war. He was a close friend of\r\nSecretary Chase, and whenever the Government needed the assistance of\r\nthe banks, the Secretary’s influence with the great merchant speedily\r\nbrought about the desired result. Moses Taylor realized the fact that\r\nthe support of the Government by the entire banking system was an\r\nimperative necessity. The presidents of the banks would be called\r\ntogether on one of these appeals from the Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nwhatever action Mr. Taylor favored would be adopted, so strong was his\r\ninfluence, and so high his standing as a merchant and financier. He\r\naccumulated wealth very fast in connection with the sugar branch of his\r\nbusiness. Most of the large sugar planters consigned their product to\r\nhis firm, and they were also governed by his superior judgment in\r\ninvesting their money, so that he always had important connections with\r\nWall Street, a fact that entitles him to a place in this book. While\r\ninvesting millions for Cuban capitalists, he also invested very largely\r\nfor himself. Moses Taylor was the first to discover the value of the\r\nDelaware, Lackawanna & Western Coal property, and while the stock was\r\nkicked about Wall Street, because the company was bankrupt, he picked it\r\nup at a few cents on the dollar, and made millions of dollars from this\r\ninvestment alone. At his death he was one of the largest owners of the\r\nstock, as his faith in it was so strong that he had refused to sell it,\r\neven though the price had risen above 140. He died worth at least forty\r\nmillions of dollars. He had no social aspirations, and no interest in\r\nanything but business. It was his idol. Few men have been harder workers\r\nfrom early in life up to their last days. He never felt that he could\r\nspare time for recreation, and was seldom known during his long business\r\ncareer to leave the city over night, summer or winter, except on\r\nbusiness. Moses Taylor had for partners in his business his son-in-law\r\nPercy R. Pyne and Lawrence Turnure, both excellent business men, and Mr.\r\nTaylor owed much of his success to the selection of these gentlemen to\r\naid in the management of his affairs. Mr. Taylor placed in the hands of\r\nthese two gentlemen, especially during the last ten years of his life,\r\nthe laboring oar of his vast business, and the successful results are\r\nthe evidence of their sagacity and marvellous ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _James Brown_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANTHONY W. MORSE.\r\n\r\nAnthony W. Morse was once one of the remarkable men of Wall Street. He\r\nmade $150,000 in speculation, bought a yacht and went to Europe during\r\nthe war. While in England, he mingled with the aristocracy, and became\r\nstrongly imbued with the idea that the North would not be successful in\r\nthe war, and that the National currency would become almost valueless.\r\nHe thought that the more the National currency depreciated, the more\r\nrailroad stocks and bonds would advance; in short, that whatever the\r\ncurrency would buy would advance, while the currency itself would become\r\nnearly worthless. He therefore became a rampant bull on stocks. He\r\nbought almost the whole list, and also did a large business in buying\r\nfor others whom he succeeded in impressing with his own ideas. He had\r\nmany followers and made a tremendous inflation. Secretary of the\r\nTreasury Chase was advised of this Morse speculation, which might prove\r\nprejudicial to the National credit, and he announced that if the\r\ninflation was carried any further, he would prick the bubble by selling\r\ngold. Anthony W. Morse thereupon personally sent Secretary Chase a\r\ndispatch saying that he would take all the gold that the United States\r\nGovernment had to sell. Mr. Chase immediately ordered Assistant\r\nTreasurer John J. Cisco to sell $10,000,000 of gold to the highest\r\nbidders. The usual notice appeared in the morning newspapers, and a\r\npanic at once followed. At 12 o’clock, or two hours after the opening of\r\nthe Exchange, it was announced from the rostrum that Anthony W. Morse\r\nhad failed. This terminated the career of Mr. Morse as a large operator\r\nand manipulator, and with his downfall the death knell was sounded to\r\nhis imported theories. He straggled manfully for several years to regain\r\nhis footing, but his prestige was gone, and he failed in every effort to\r\npush his way again to the front. His ill-success soured him. His health\r\nfailed, and he went to Havana to recuperate. There he died with\r\nprofanity on his lips, enraged at the failure of all his hopes. He paid\r\nthe penalty of disloyalty. His friends of the English nobility were\r\nlargely to blame for all his misfortunes. Their predictions of the\r\nsuccess of the South led him on to irretrievable ruin. He did not see\r\nthat their wish was father to the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Edmund Clarence Stedman_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FORMER GIANTS OF THE STREET.\r\n\r\nHenry Keep, once President of the Lake Shore road, and also of the New\r\nYork Central, was in his day a power in Wall Street. He was the first to\r\ndiscover the intrinsic value of railroad property in the Northwest, and\r\nmanipulated Chicago & Northwestern stock, both common and preferred,\r\nvery successfully, making a great deal of money for himself and friends.\r\nHe died very wealthy. He came to New York city from Watertown, in the\r\ninterior of New York, and at first was an exchange broker, dealing\r\nmainly in uncurrent money. He had previously served in some humble\r\nposition on a railroad. By careful and economical habits he was able to\r\nleave a fortune of several million dollars, largely in common and\r\npreferred Northwestern stock. The plot of ground on which William H.\r\nVanderbilt built his palatial Fifth Avenue home was once the property of\r\nMr. Keep, who originally bought it for about $250,000 for the purpose of\r\nbuilding a charitable institution, but changed his mind when the\r\nproperty quadrupled in value. Then he concluded that charity should\r\nbegin at home. He sold the plot, extending for one block along Fifth\r\nAvenue, to Mr. Vanderbilt for one million dollars. Still his original\r\nintentions were good, and it was only after the real estate market, as\r\nwith Satanic malice, had in that locality advanced 400 per cent. and\r\ntaken him up into a high mountain of temptation, that his\r\nphilanthropical project turned awry and lost the name of action. While\r\nMr. Keep made a signally good President of the Lake Shore road and was a\r\ngreat manipulator of stocks, he was a failure as President of the New\r\nYork Central, and he resigned that post having no confidence in the\r\nfuture of the property. Commodore Vanderbilt, who believed in the\r\nproperty, became his successor, and in a previous chapter I have given\r\nthe story of the rise of that remarkable man. It is of interest to\r\nrecall, by the way, that while President of the Lake Shore road Mr. Keep\r\nwent largely short of the stock. As the President he naturally had\r\ninside information. Addison Jerome, a brother of Leonard Jerome, was a\r\nbig operator of the day, and undertook to corner President Keep. In\r\nthose days a great deal of stock was sold on seller’s option for thirty\r\nand sixty days. Mr. Keep had sold largely in this way, and Addison\r\nJerome and his clique had bought heavily, expecting that the corner\r\nwould be complete when the options should mature. A surprise awaited\r\nthem. Mr. Keep made deliveries promptly in brand new shares. They were\r\nreally an over-issue by the Company. It was a Waterloo in a double sense\r\nfor Jerome and his fellow bulls. They were in over their heads. It had\r\nsuch a dampening effect that they immediately threw up the sponge and\r\nthe stock came down with a crash. The issue of this new stock was\r\nsmoothed over by turning the avails into the treasury of the Company, a\r\nfact, however, which did not prevent Mr. Keep from making a pretty good\r\nturn on his shorts.\r\n\r\n                          J. PIERPONT MORGAN.\r\n\r\nJ. Pierpont Morgan, known as the “Railroad Reorganizer,” and who has won\r\na place in the front rank among American financiers, is a son of the\r\nwell-known Junius S. Morgan, the head of the firm of J. S. Morgan & Co.,\r\nof London, and the successor of George Peabody, the great philanthropist\r\nin the banking business there. George Peabody, some years before his\r\ndeath, visited this country, and, desiring a partner in his great\r\nbanking house, made inquiry in Boston for a suitable person. Junius S.\r\nMorgan was recommended as a young man of exceptional business talents\r\nand he was selected for the responsible post, the firm being known as\r\nGeorge Peabody & Co. On the death of the celebrated head of the firm,\r\nthe name was changed to J. S. Morgan & Co. The success of the father has\r\nbeen repeated in the signally successful career of the son. During the\r\npalmy days of the firm of Duncan, Sherman & Co., once renowned among the\r\nfinancial strongholds of the country, J. Pierpont Morgan was one of the\r\nclerks. It was there he graduated as a practical student of financial\r\nachievements; it was there he won his spurs for the monetary campaigns\r\nthat awaited him. Leaving the house that was then a synonym for\r\ninvincible solidity, Mr. Morgan established the firm of Dabney, Morgan &\r\nCo. Mr. Dabney was formerly one of the firm of Duncan, Sherman & Co.\r\nAfter a few years the firm in which Mr. Morgan had thus first engaged in\r\nbusiness on his own account was dissolved. But the check, if it may so\r\nbe termed, was only momentary, and colossal feats of financiering were\r\nto deck his career with triumphs. He formed a connection with the\r\nwealthy Drexels, of Philadelphia, and a New York branch of their banking\r\nhouse was established, under the name of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which has\r\nfor some years been largely engaged in the reorganization of crippled\r\nrailroads like the West Shore, Reading and many others. And they have\r\nbeen very successful. They have been financial physicians, healing sick\r\ncorporate bodies; monetary surgeons, amputating needless expenditures\r\nand reckless methods; or, in perhaps more happy figure, skilful pruners\r\nof the vine, that the ultimate vintage might be more abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Yrs Sincerely\r\n  H. Victor Newcombe_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan is endowed with very positive traits of character. He has the\r\ndriving powers of a locomotive. He cares nothing for show; he is a plain\r\nman of action. He strikes hard blows; he is naturally aggressive. In\r\nspeech he is candid to the verge of bluntness; in action he is short,\r\nsharp and decisive. Like a true soldier, he is a man of acts rather than\r\nwords. Rugged as a Spartan in his nature, hating circumlocution, bombast\r\nand palaver, going straight to the mark, yet with due caution and\r\nprudence, he exhibits many of the best traits of the practical\r\nfinancier.\r\n\r\nI have asked Mr. Morgan for his picture for publication in this book,\r\nbut with natural personal modesty, he has recommended that his handsome\r\npartner, Anthony Drexel, of Philadelphia, be selected in his place, and\r\nwith a view to encouragement in Wall Street of blushing modesty—that\r\ncentury flower of the financial conservatory—I have complied with his\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS L. JAMES.\r\n\r\nPresident of the Lincoln National Bank, has had a career in New York\r\nbrilliant in the service of the public, and marked in the practical\r\nskill with which confidences and enterprises have been directed by him.\r\nHis training has contributed largely to his success as a financier. He\r\ncame from Utica in 1861 and entered the Custom House as Deputy, and\r\nfinally attained the position of Postmaster-General after a long and\r\nsuccessful term as Postmaster of the City of New York. Mr. James\r\ndirected the affairs of the Lincoln Bank so successfully that what\r\npromised to be a small up-town bank has developed into a National bank\r\nof considerable importance. He is one of the men of the times, one who\r\nfeels the tide of local affairs, a man of the people who acts from\r\nwholly conscientious motives, and whose ambition has never exceeded his\r\nsense of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Moses Taylor_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\n          JAMES B. AND JOHN H. CLEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjects of this sketch, whose portraits adorn these pages, are both\r\nmembers of my firm and I think this book would be incomplete without\r\nputting in a few words in reference to them. As will be seen by the\r\nsketches which follow, they both commenced their business careers in a\r\nmodest way and through perseverance and industry have attained positions\r\nin the financial world which are in every way creditable to them. I have\r\nmade it a rule never to introduce a blood relative into my office for a\r\nposition of trust unless I believed him worthy of confidence and capable\r\nof performing the duties assigned to him in an intelligent manner. To do\r\nso would be an act of injustice, not only to him but to his associates\r\nin the office, and generally causes ill feeling and bad results in the\r\nend. Happily with my nephews I have had no such cause or ground for\r\ncomplaint. On the score of merit alone they have succeeded in advancing\r\nthemselves to their present positions.\r\n\r\nJames Blanchard Clews was born in Dunkirk, N. Y., August 4, 1859. After\r\ngraduating from Chamberlain College, in this State, he entered the\r\ngeneral office of the Red Line Transit Company, in Buffalo, N. Y., where\r\nhe spent two years. He then accepted a position of responsibility in the\r\nGeneral Manager’s office of the Union Steamboat Company, also located in\r\nBuffalo. Here his ability and his growing capacity for making a good\r\nbusiness man were further satisfactorily illustrated and recognized by\r\nthose officially over him. Realizing, however, that Wall Street offered\r\nbetter opportunities for advancement, he resigned his position and\r\nobtained one in my banking office as book-keeper. Commencing at the\r\nbottom of the clerical staff, he displayed so much ability, coupled with\r\nuntiring energy in the performance of his duties, it was a pleasure to\r\npromote him from time to time, whenever an opportunity offered, with the\r\nresult that after eight years of vigorous training through the\r\nsuccessive grades of Book-keeper, Cashier, and General Manager, he was\r\nrewarded in 1890 by being made a member of my firm. It will thus be seen\r\nthat my nephew possesses a thorough and practical knowledge of the\r\ninside workings of a banking house which is so essential to a successful\r\nWall Street business man. Being besides a student of nature, he has also\r\nimproved every opportunity to learn the value of railroad and other\r\ninvestments and to-day is a recognized authority on all such matters. He\r\nhas served as President of an important railroad and is a Director in a\r\nnumber of large corporations.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Clews,[1] junior member of the firm of Henry Clews & Co., was\r\nborn October 28, 1856. In beginning his business career he entered the\r\nservice of the Erie Railroad Company, in the transportation department,\r\nwhere he gained a general knowledge of railroad management and its\r\naffairs. After a few years with that company he was offered a position\r\nwith the Western Transportation Company, the water line of the New York\r\nCentral Railroad. Here he had the opportunity of completing his\r\neducation in all the branches of transportation. He was then appointed\r\nAgent of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railway at East Buffalo, N.\r\nY., the distributing point for all freight between the East and the\r\nWest. From this place he entered Wall Street, where he evinced the same\r\nprogressive spirit. In 1890 he became a member of the New York Stock\r\nExchange, acting as one of the chief brokers for Henry Clews & Co., and\r\nJanuary 1, 1898, he obtained an interest in the firm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Deceased April 10, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Thomas L. James_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n       A REMARKABLE CHAPTER OF HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny review of the advance of this country during the past fifteen years,\r\nforms a record of the most wonderful progress ever made by any nation in\r\nsuch a short period. A record of the development of the country’s\r\nresources through a resistless energy that seems destined to control the\r\nmarkets of the world, reads almost like one of Grimm’s famous tales, for\r\nafter numerous trials, and the surmounting of many obstacles, the fairy\r\nwand is turning what we will into gold.\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of the Vanderbilt boom of 1885 is to be found in the\r\nenormous mileage of new railroad construction in 1887, namely 12,000\r\nmiles. It may have looked at the time excessive, but it has turned out\r\nto be a fortunate anticipation of the great business strides made since\r\nthat time. As far back as that year, our exports of manufactured\r\narticles began to show an appreciable increase.\r\n\r\nThe year following will always be memorable as the time of the great\r\nblizzard which tied New York up so effectually for several days. As a\r\ndirect result of the exposure to its severity, the country lost in\r\nRoscoe Conkling one of the most picturesque figures in American politics\r\nand a man of unblemished reputation. He was taken from the arena of\r\naffairs too soon to allow his participation in the presidential campaign\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nMy own experience at the time has impressed the memory of the great\r\nstorm strongly upon my mind. I had gone to Newport accompanied by Mrs.\r\nClews to inspect some improvements then being made at my summer home,\r\nand in returning we came across the bay in the regular boat for the\r\npurpose of taking the noon-day train which ran from Boston to New York.\r\nWhen we were about half way over the bay, a vicious squall struck us and\r\nwe began to doubt if we should ever reach the shore again. Finally,\r\nhowever, we did manage to land, and connected with the belated train.\r\nProgress of course was slow, so slow in fact that the next morning saw\r\nus only as far as New London, whence further movement was out of the\r\nquestion. Many of my readers will recall the railroad ferry over the bay\r\nfrom New London. The last train previous to ours had been started\r\nacross, but the violence of the tempest had compelled the pilot to give\r\nup the task and return. With more incoming trains, New London was soon\r\ncongested by the sudden increase in population, and accommodations of\r\nany sort were at a premium. We were for a time at a loss as to where we\r\ncould go, but fortunately succeeded in inducing the manager of the hotel\r\nthere to install us in the private apartments of the proprietor, who had\r\nthe day before started with his family for Florida. He spent the ensuing\r\nfour days upon the railroad, between New London and New Haven, banked in\r\nby a snow drift six feet high, while we enjoyed the hospitality of his\r\napartments during that time. I am sure that we could not conscientiously\r\ncomplain of the exchange. Telegraphic communication with New York was\r\ncompletely shut off. As our children had remained in the city, we were\r\nnaturally anxious to know of their welfare and relieve any anxiety they\r\nmight have as to our safety. There remained but one means of\r\ncommunication, and that a wire to Boston, whence messages could be\r\ncabled to Liverpool, and back to New York, and that is the way we got\r\nword to and from the metropolis. That was a rather circuitous way, but\r\nit was effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _John H. Clews._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland’s renomination and accompanying free trade talk, disturbed\r\nthe markets more or less from the date of his nomination in 1888 up to\r\nthe time of General Harrison’s election. The latter’s entrance into the\r\nWhite House started the entire business of the country going, and\r\nthrough his wise management, we were brought to a very high point of\r\nprosperity, the last year of his term being, up to that time, one of the\r\nmost prosperous in our history. One of General Harrison’s most signal\r\nachievements was in the exchange of reciprocity treaties, which was\r\nmanaged in such a masterly manner by his resourceful Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of General Harrison’s term, occurred the greatest\r\nfinancial shock the world had experienced in the last quarter century,\r\nor since the panic of 1873.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of the great firm of Baring Bros. of London in the fall\r\nof 1890 proved a demoralizing force from the effects of which finances\r\ndid not thoroughly recover for several years. The direct cause of the\r\nfailure, as is now well known, was over-commitment in Argentine\r\nenterprises. Through the representations of an agent of theirs who had\r\nvisited the country, everything bearing the name of Argentine was\r\ncolored a most rosy hue, and the investments of that great house and its\r\nfollowing were enormous. The inevitable reaction from such inflation\r\nfound them with an immense load of these securities unmarketable, and\r\nthey were forced to suspend. The assistance rendered in rehabilitating\r\nthe firm has been signally successful. Through the efforts of Mr.\r\nLidderdale, Governor of the Bank of England, that institution took over\r\nsome seven million pounds sterling of the congested obligations of the\r\nfirm. By the wise, patient, and sagacious management of these former\r\nunmarketable properties the bank was finally enabled to realize enough\r\ntherefrom to pay up all the arrears of the firm.\r\n\r\nThe liquidation of American securities by British holders which was\r\nconsequent upon their failure was enormous in volume and extended over\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1890 was further noteworthy as marking the birth of that\r\nunfortunate compromise of the silver agitation known as the Sherman\r\nsilver-purchase law, which was to bring about such direful results\r\nwithin a brief three years. After the shock of the Baring panic had\r\nsubsided, the beneficial effects of the McKinley tariff law began to be\r\nfelt and with increased exports, largely of grain, in the succeeding\r\nyear, together with ample protection for home industries, we were\r\nushered into 1892 under very auspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nBountiful crops again provided a basis for what developed into a\r\nwonderfully prosperous year. During the year, Jay Gould (largely through\r\nthe aid of his son George), by one of his characteristic strokes,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining control of the Union Pacific system, while Mr.\r\nHuntington was thinking the matter over; but his personal control was\r\nnot to last very long, for in December of that year, Mr. Gould died,\r\nafter a career of great activity and venturesomeness, which has\r\nelsewhere been reviewed in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _J. B. Clews_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party still clung to their idol, and Mr. Cleveland was\r\nrenominated for the presidency in 1892, and by one of those inexplicable\r\nturns of public opinion which foolishly wished a change of\r\nadministration in the midst of prosperous times, he was elected, and\r\nreturned to Washington the following March, be it said, enjoying the\r\nconfidence of the great majority of the people. Almost from the time of\r\nthat election, the Wall Street markets were depressed, the fear of free\r\ntrade measures being the basis of distrust. Late in the year, the\r\nTreasury’s stock of gold began to show signs of diminishing, and with\r\nthe exception of a few rallies, one notably in the following January,\r\nprices continued on the downward course. Co-incident with the decrease\r\nof gold reserves arose reports of a disposition on the part of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to interpret the word “coin” in our Government\r\nobligations as allowing the redemption of the bonds in either gold or\r\nsilver at the option of the Government. The effect of any doubt or\r\nquestion upon this most important subject could only result in\r\nunsettling confidence; of which Addison speaks as the “high priest in\r\nthe temple of trade.” For the first time in very many years, our\r\nTreasury operations showed a deficit, and things were going from bad to\r\nworse. The first great smash in prices occurred in May, when the famous\r\nCordage Trust went to pieces. At the same time, Sugar stock and the\r\nremainder of the then few industrial shares took part in the sharp\r\ndecline. The gold reserve had by the middle of the year reached\r\nalarmingly low figures, so that the pressure of public opinion compelled\r\nthe calling of an extra session of Congress for the purpose of repealing\r\nthe silver purchase clause of the Sherman law,—which had proved to be a\r\nveritable “Old Man of the Sea” upon the back of the country, threatening\r\nto throttle business interests everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional procrastination, and obstructive tactics in the Senate\r\nworked havoc with trade and finance, and when relief finally came in the\r\nrepeal of the silver purchase clause, the vitality of the patient had\r\nsunk so low, that it was a matter of years before returning health, in\r\nthe form of confidence, brought back our native buoyancy and push. It\r\nbecame necessary early in the following year to issue $50,000,000 worth\r\nof bonds in order to keep the gold reserve from getting too near the\r\nvanishing point. Tariff agitation, which had been started by President\r\nCleveland’s message to Congress in December, 1893, upset all the\r\ncalculations of business men, who hoped, after a disastrous summer, that\r\nthe tide had turned. But, no sooner was the fear of a silver deluge\r\nquieted, than revenue reform brought on another period of anxiety and\r\ndelay. Fortunately when that distorted measure (with its 640 Senate\r\namendments) which bore the name of the late William L. Wilson, a man of\r\ndeep thought and the highest integrity, did become a law in the\r\nfollowing year, it was not burdened with an income tax.\r\n\r\nThere are those who argue, probably to their own satisfaction, that this\r\nlatter is an equitable form of taxation, but it has always appeared to\r\nme as putting a premium on idleness by taxing thrift.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROSWELL P. FLOWER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother issue of $50,000,000 bonds was necessary before the year was\r\nout, and in spite of this replenishment, gold exports to pay our debts\r\nto Europe for securities sent back to us by the ream, continued in such\r\nvolume as to render a further issue imperative in the following\r\nFebruary. This will be remembered as somewhat unique in our Treasury\r\noperations, being in the form of a purchase of 3,500,000 oz. of gold,\r\nwhich cost the Government $62,500,000. The famous syndicate which\r\nundertook the delivery of the precious metal, agreed to do all in its\r\npower by the further deposit of gold in the Treasury and as far as\r\npossible, a control of foreign exchange rates to keep the reserve\r\nintact. Its powerful aid unquestionably saved the people from many more\r\nbusiness disasters, by a bolstering up of confidence in the power of the\r\nGovernment to pay its debts. The syndicate lived up to its agreement\r\nfully, depositing in the month of August some seven and a half millions\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\nOne scarcely hears mentioned nowadays the name of that poor fellow whose\r\nfabulous fortune (on paper) finally proved too burdensome for his\r\nuneducated mind. Barney Barnato was in his way a picturesque character,\r\nand a most vivid illustration of the overthrow of mind by matter, when\r\nthe former is not in control.\r\n\r\nThe sharp break in South African shares in the London market during\r\nOctober, of course exerted a sympathetic influence here; but worse\r\nthings were yet in store for us. Our President’s famous Venezuela\r\nmessage to Congress in December, 1895, acted like an earthquake—which\r\nshook the markets to their very foundations and engulfed hundreds of\r\nmillions of values before it subsided. The final outcome of the dispute\r\nbetween England and Venezuela has to a very great extent vindicated the\r\nformer’s claims. Let us, however, look upon the whole matter as a step\r\nforward for civilization in the advancement of the principle of\r\narbitration, the true solution of all international difficulties. In\r\n1896, we did finally reach the end of our troubles, though not without\r\nmuch worriment. A further bond issue of $100,000,000 to meet deficits,\r\nbrought that total up to $262,500,000 issued in two years. A rather\r\nexpensive administration, but “troubles come not singly, but in\r\nbattalions.”\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Campaign just past, with the same nominees at the head\r\nof the respective parties, recalls the wild free silver talk of four\r\nyears ago. Panic and depression succeeding each other had left the\r\npeople almost hysterical. After Bryan’s nomination in July, gold\r\nhoarding was the order of the day. Of course the effect of this on the\r\nmoney and security markets meant, under the circumstances, another\r\ndownward plunge in prices. New York Central sold at 88, the lowest price\r\nin the past fifteen years, and C., B. & Q. at 53, the lowest price in\r\nnearly forty years, and all other stocks sold down in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  J. PIERPONT MORGAN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that we reached the end of our troubles in 1896, but the end\r\ndid not come till the November election, which showed that William\r\nMcKinley, “the advance agent of prosperity,” had been elected President.\r\nThe nomination of William J. Bryan, hitherto a comparatively unknown\r\nman, but who electrified the Democratic National Convention by his\r\nspecious eloquence, the eloquence of a political Belial, able, in the\r\nMiltonic phrase, “to make the worst appear the better reason,” whose\r\nfamous phrase, “you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this\r\ncrown of thorns, you shall not crucify labor upon a cross of gold,”\r\nswept the convention off its feet and made him the nominee for\r\npresident, was a blow that for a time seriously disturbed Wall Street\r\nand commercial circles everywhere. Mr. Bryan called for the free coinage\r\nof silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, and by his tireless activity in\r\nstumping the country created a feeling of depression that reached the\r\npitch of panic and left the people almost hysterical with fear. But as\r\nMartin Van Buren said on one occasion, “the sober second thought of the\r\npeople is never wrong and is always efficient.” The sober second thought\r\nof the people carried the day. Crowds might flock to hear the orator,\r\nbut they voted with the party of prosperity and honor. The carefully\r\nwritten speech of Mr. Bryan, a speech which, for once, he read from his\r\nmanuscript in the great Madison Square Garden meeting, did not deceive\r\nthe people; it fell flat.\r\n\r\nWith Bryan’s fiasco in this city, the clouds finally began to break. How\r\nplainly the record of these four years shows the absolute domination of\r\nthe markets by Washington. And not of the financial markets alone by any\r\nmeans, but of the whole business interests of the country, which finally\r\nwere well-nigh paralyzed by four years of increasing anxiety and wonder\r\nas to what might happen next.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to turn away from that period of distress to the\r\nsucceeding years of prosperity. The vindication of the good sense of the\r\npeople in the election of William McKinley did, at last, turn the tide;\r\nand for good and all, let us hope. With an unquestioned currency basis,\r\nimprovement became possible. We were greatly favored too, in the first\r\nyear of Mr. McKinley’s administration, by bountiful crops at a time of\r\nshortage in Russia, France, and the Danubian Provinces. It was a great\r\nyear of prosperity for our farmers, who, through good prices, and the\r\nexportation of some 120,000,000 bushels of wheat, were enabled to pay\r\noff mortgages in wholesale fashion, and herein we see the beginning of\r\npresent good times. Furthermore our export trade showed great increase.\r\nAs was to be expected, there was a great rush of importations just prior\r\nto the passage of the Dingley Tariff Bill in July, and a consequent\r\ndecline in revenues immediately thereafter; but the completed record of\r\nits operation up to the present time is a splendid tribute to the wisdom\r\nof its author. The Supreme Court decision in 1897 in what was known as\r\nthe Trans-Missouri Case, declaring all railroad pooling illegal, proved\r\nsomewhat of a shock to the market, but with improvement in business, our\r\nroads soon found enough traffic before them to more than go ‘round,\r\nwithout worrying about its division.\r\n\r\nThe year 1898 began very favorably with large gold imports and easy\r\nmoney. Cuban affairs, which had begun to threaten late in the previous\r\nyear, finally culminated in the outbreak of war with Spain in April.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things in Cuba having become a reproach to the\r\ncivilized world, this Government, acting for the conscience of\r\nChristendom, directed that the war which Spain was waging against the\r\nCuban revolutionists should cease, with all its indescribable horrors,\r\nits barbarous cruelties to women and children, and as Spain did not heed\r\nthe warning, our Government intervened in the interest of common\r\nhumanity, an event which marked a distinct advance in the history of the\r\nhuman race, for history makes no mention of any war waged on such a\r\nscale in behalf of the cause of humanity. Certainly never was a war more\r\nclearly justified or one which showed greater courage on the part of the\r\nintervening nation, for there can be no doubt that more than one of the\r\nContinental powers of Europe would have been glad to side with Spain and\r\nwould have done so, but for the emphatic negative of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nNaturally there ensued a period of depression, but it was short-lived.\r\nThe ensuing months of activity and buoyancy surpassed anything of the\r\nkind in our history. After the apprehension as to how the business world\r\nwould adjust itself to war conditions had passed away, business began to\r\nboom all over the country. We were on our feet again with financial\r\nhealth restored. That wonderful boom in the stock market, begun in the\r\nsummer of 1898 and lasting until the spring of 1899, will not soon be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIt seems more like a dream than a fact that trade and commerce and\r\nfinancial operations could swell to such well-nigh inconceivable\r\nfigures, revealing a degree of prosperity almost past belief, like some\r\nmarvelous good fortune of an individual in a Persian tale, favored by\r\ngood Genii, actual fact rivalling fancy or throwing it far into the\r\nshade. In other words the oldest and most experienced merchants and\r\nfinanciers in this country were astounded at the degree of solid\r\nprosperity attained by the great Republic, the lion’s whelp, rivalling\r\nor surpassing the strength of the old lion, the mother country across\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nTo the late Ex-Governor Flower belongs the credit of fearlessly taking\r\nthe initiative in that marvelous rise in values to which I shall revert\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nThe formal close of the Spanish war gave fresh impetus to trading and\r\nprices kept soaring well on into the spring of 1899. The year 1898 has\r\nthe distinction of marking the beginning of the greatest era of trade\r\ncombinations, those gigantic commercial engines, that the world has ever\r\nseen. The capitalization of those inaugurated during 1898 and 1899\r\nreached the fabulous aggregate of $3,500,000,000. The mind is staggered\r\nby the possibilities of enterprise which such a sum suggests.\r\n\r\nThe tendency towards centralization in the railroad world was first\r\nshown in the merger of the Lake Shore road with the New York Central.\r\n\r\nThe year 1899 was one of great prosperity, the greatest since we have\r\nbeen a nation, albeit its close was marked by one of the worst\r\nsemi-panics the Street has ever experienced. In order to account for\r\nsome of the most important features of the panic of December, 1899, it\r\nis necessary to take a glance backward at certain great financial events\r\nof the year even as early as April.\r\n\r\nIn that month was formed the famous Amalgamated Copper Corporation, a\r\ncreation of the Standard Oil magnates.\r\n\r\nThe capital stock of the company was $75,000,000. The shares were said\r\nto be subscribed five times over. Owing to its parentage, the stock\r\nbecame popular, and was sustained at par for some time, but scarcely two\r\nmonths had elapsed before a break of 25 per cent. in the price occurred.\r\n\r\nThis break was regarded as a rather suspicious circumstance, and was\r\nsupposed by the “knowing ones” to be a part of the deal. The Amalgamated\r\nCompany was a mammoth combination, comprised of large share interests in\r\nover 30 companies, the famous Anaconda of Montana heading the list, and\r\nbeing the most prominent\r\n\r\nThe panic fell most severely upon the copper companies, the shrinkage on\r\nthe share capital of which for the year is alone estimated at nearly\r\n$200,000,000.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the currency movement to the South and West had been\r\nunusually large and prolonged, and finally tightness of money brought\r\nabout an immense drop in the entire stock market. But with general\r\nconditions prosperous all over the country, such panics happily do not\r\nleave lasting scars.\r\n\r\nThe last year of the wonderful nineteenth century has been a remarkable\r\none in our history. Since the first defeat of the silver agitators in\r\n1896, our financial strides have been so rapid that it seems now a\r\nquestion of but a short time when New York will be the financial centre\r\nof the world. What a contrast between our position in 1900, and that in\r\n1895, when we were knocking at the door of Europe with bonds for sale to\r\nprovide running expenses for our Government. To-day England finds it to\r\nher interest to place $25,000,000 of her war loan with us, Germany asks\r\nfor $20,000,000 of American gold, Russia is seeking to borrow from us\r\nand Sweden has not gone empty-handed away. And these accommodations have\r\nbeen accorded without causing so much as a ripple in our money markets.\r\nThe source of such plenty is of course found in our wonderful increase\r\nof exports. For ten months of this present calendar year, the trade\r\nbalance in our favor approximates $500,000,000, making, in the past\r\nthree years, the vast total of fifteen hundred million dollars balance\r\nto our credit. There we see both the lever and the fulcrum with which to\r\nmove the financial world.\r\n\r\nA little over a year ago occurred the death of Cornelius Vanderbilt, the\r\ngrandson and namesake of the Commodore. Here was a gentleman whose\r\ncharities were almost boundless. His gifts to the people through art and\r\nin many other ways were princely, but perhaps his memory is greener in\r\nthe minds of those who, through his great private charity, were lifted\r\nabove want.\r\n\r\nThese great latter day fortunes have not often failed, in this country,\r\nin being administered by men whose conception of life, and of duty\r\ntoward their fellow men has turned the duty into a pleasure. This is a\r\nvery great tribute to American citizenship and should not be forgotten\r\nor lost sight of by our sometime critics.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Currency bill in March, 1900, undoubtedly did much to\r\nincrease Europe’s faith in our monetary stability and, furthermore, the\r\nresult of the Presidential election of 1900, the triumph of the party of\r\nsound money seems to preclude the recurrence of any attacks upon the\r\nfinancial honor of this country. There has been a campaign of education\r\ngoing on in this country ever since the advocate of the free and\r\nunlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 first promulgated\r\nhis doctrines. The benefit to the people of this knowledge of public\r\naffairs is clearly apparent. They will have none of false theories and\r\nsuicidal experiments, they will not go after false financial gods, they\r\nwill not bow the knee to the Baal of repudiation and confiscation.\r\n\r\nWhile the modern method of commercial development is open to criticism\r\nin some respects, still I take it that the evils complained of are not\r\nthose of very existence but are rather those of circumstance, and are\r\nopen to correction by the will of the people. How often have we heard\r\nthat these combinations stifle competition—but for how long? Does not\r\ntheir existence excite competition? Furthermore, their management calls\r\nfor the very highest ability and creates a keen intellectual competition\r\nwhich cannot fail to be of educational value at large. It remains for\r\nensuing years to provide correction for those defects which are bound to\r\nappear in any new and untried system.\r\n\r\nWe end the century that almost covers our national existence with a past\r\nrecord and prospects unparalleled. We enter the new century full of\r\nfaith in our institutions, that have stood severe tests even in our\r\nshort life, and full of hope for even greater national achievements. We\r\nare fast taking the lead in the affairs of nations as well as in the\r\naffairs of commerce and finance, and have need of great steadiness of\r\ncharacter, and fixity of national honor, which now seems assured for all\r\ntime. It augurs well that we begin the twentieth century, which displays\r\nsuch vistas of greatness, at peace with all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\n             BOOMS IN WALL STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street has lately been enjoying quite a boom in some respects\r\ndiffering from any in its previous history. Probably the most\r\ninteresting feature about this boom is that it is not in any sense\r\nspectacular. In that respect it is unique. Prices of many stocks are\r\nhigher and intrinsic values greater than they have ever been before. The\r\nmarket has all the qualities that normally would cause intensest\r\nexcitement and focus the attention of the entire country on the Stock\r\nExchange. Yet in spite of these conditions, the Street is in a normal\r\nstate of mind, and it is doubtful if the general mass of the people, who\r\nget their information from the newspapers are fully aware that there is\r\neven an ordinary boom in Wall Street. This unusual condition is due, I\r\nbelieve, to the fact that the boom we are enjoying is built on a\r\nfoundation that reaches clear to the bowels of the earth. There is\r\nnothing unnatural or artificial about it. Wall Street is simply one of\r\nthe centres that reflects the general prosperity throughout the country.\r\nFarmers, merchants, mechanics, mill workers, and miners are all so\r\nintent in keeping pace with the progress in their own pursuits that they\r\nhave no time to cast eyes our way. The same conditions that are booming\r\nstocks, are booming everything else in the country at an equal rate, so\r\nthat we are in nowise singular or deserving of special attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N. Y.\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother factor too, has developed in the Street that prevents the usual\r\nexcitement and hurly burly incident to a rising market. This is the\r\nabsence of a pronounced central figure, or controlling force. Usually a\r\nboom centres about some one man who stands boldly out in the open, or\r\nwhose hand it is known is manipulating values. At present the\r\nmanipulation is being carried on in a method that is as quiet as it is\r\nnovel and unusual. That the market is being manipulated, is apparent\r\nenough even to the most casual observer. But the source of this\r\nmanipulation is probably known only to a few; all others are but\r\nstudents in the Street. They know that a new order has come, and that\r\nthis order is due to the most powerful and resistless influence that has\r\never manifested itself in Wall Street. This influence is very largely\r\ncomposed of the Standard Oil Combination, who have introduced in their\r\nWall Street operations the same quiet, unostentatious, but resistless\r\nmeasures that they have always employed heretofore in the conduct of\r\ntheir corporate affairs. Beside this group, every other man or\r\ncombination of men that has ever operated in the Street are materially\r\nbelittled by comparison. The heretofore conspicuously big operators that\r\nhave flashed up and across the horizon, appear comparatively small\r\nbeside the men who are running things for us now.\r\n\r\nAt his best, Jay Gould was always compelled to face the chance of\r\nfailure. Commodore Vanderbilt, though he often had the Street in the\r\npalm of his hand, was often driven into a corner where he had to do\r\nbattle for his life, and so it has been with every great speculator, or\r\ncombination of speculators, until the men who control the Standard Oil\r\ntook hold. With them, manipulation has ceased to be speculation. Their\r\nresources are so vast that they need only concentrate on any given\r\nproperty in order to do with it what they please. And that they have so\r\nconcentrated on a considerable number of properties outside of the\r\nstocks in which they are popularly credited with being exclusively\r\ninterested is a fact well known to every one who has opportunities of\r\ngetting beneath the surface. They are the greatest operators the world\r\nhas ever seen, and the beauty of their method is the quiet and lack of\r\nostentation with which they carry it on. There are no gallery plays,\r\nthere are no scareheads in the newspapers, there is no wild scramble and\r\nexcitement. With them the process is gradual, thorough and steady, with\r\nnever a waver or break. How much money this group of men have made, it\r\nis impossible even to estimate. That it is a sum beside which the gains\r\nof the most daring speculator of the past were a mere flea bite, is\r\nputting the case mildly, and there is an utter absence of chance that is\r\nterrible to contemplate. This combination controls Wall Street almost\r\nabsolutely. Many of the strongest financial institutions are at their\r\nservice in supplying accommodations when needed. With such power and\r\nfacilities it is scarcely conceivable what these men must be making,\r\nwhat they can do on either side of the market. So far, fortunately,\r\ntheir manipulations have all been one way, upwards, and in conjunction\r\nwith the general prosperity it has resulted in making large sums of\r\nmoney for nearly everybody in the Street.\r\n\r\nHere and there we have heard of losses, some of them fairly large, but\r\nin comparison with the general money making these are hardly to be taken\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\nThe last preceding boom that Wall Street enjoyed was as different from\r\nthe present as it is possible to imagine. It had all the elements which\r\nthis one has not. It centred about one man who stood out in the\r\nlime-light clear and distinct. It kept the Stock Exchange in a constant\r\nstate of ferment. It filled the newspapers with column upon column of\r\nsensational stories. It made millions for an army of retainers, on\r\npaper, and it kept the market jerking up and down for months. Roswell P.\r\nFlower, ex-governor of the State of New York, was the leader of the\r\nboom, and a more picturesque figure has never been seen in Wall Street,\r\nwhich is saying a great deal. Mr. Flower was an individual of very plain\r\nexterior. He often used language that was noticeable more for its force\r\nand directness and emphasis, than it was for polish. He had an ambling\r\ngait and looked like a well-fed farmer. He was rarely seen without a\r\nhuge quid of tobacco that almost filled the left side of his mouth.\r\nSpittoons were an essential part of the furnishings of his office. His\r\nclothing hung on his person not unlike meal sacks. His hat was rarely\r\nbrushed, and for days at a time, apparently, he forgot to shave.\r\nAltogether he was the last person, in appearance, who might be expected\r\nto lead in a district that is famous for its well groomed men. His\r\neducation was certainly not collegiate; doubtless all his peculiar\r\ntraits the ordinary man would have judged a handicap, still they were\r\nMr. Flower’s strongest aids. The lack of artificial polish gave people\r\nconfidence in his statements. His limited education enabled him to think\r\nclearly along certain lines without being hampered with mental\r\ndigressions, which would probably have come with a higher original\r\nmental culture.\r\n\r\nAs the administrator and manager of the estate of his brother-in-law,\r\nHenry Keep, he came into the Street twenty or twenty-five years ago. He\r\nin that way controlled a large amount of funds, which by conservative\r\ndirection he increased very substantially. He scarcely ever figured in\r\nthe speculative field to any great extent, until after he had completed\r\nhis term as Governor of New York State. When he returned to the Street\r\nfrom Albany, he naturally came with a considerable prestige.\r\nEx-governors of the Empire State are not very plentiful in and about the\r\nStock Exchange. He also brought with him a large political following. In\r\nboth of the great parties in New York State there are many men of\r\nstanding and influence who like to take a flyer in Wall Street. Almost\r\nto a man they associated themselves with Mr. Flower, who, during his\r\nterm at the capital had made hosts of friends with Republicans and\r\nDemocrats alike, and this, though his party loyalty had never been\r\nquestioned. He also had close associations with most of the big\r\ncapitalists. After he had settled down to business, on leaving politics\r\nbehind, Mr. Flower picked out several stocks as his specialties, Chicago\r\nGas, Federal Steel and Rock Island being some of these. Under his\r\nmanipulation all these properties went up and soon began to show a big\r\nadvance, unusual strength and great activity. The bears made frequent\r\nassaults on his position and now and then pushed him towards the wall,\r\nbut he always fought his way to the front again, and came out master in\r\nevery encounter. When he had himself pretty well entrenched in the\r\nspecialties he was handling, he suddenly plunged into Brooklyn Rapid\r\nTransit, and for months he kept things stirred up in a way that even\r\nWall Street has not seen very often., He picked up the stock commencing\r\nat six dollars a share, and in an incredibly short time ran it up to\r\nover 138. Almost every politician in the State made a fortune on paper.\r\nMr. Flower was immensely popular with the Wall Street news reporters,\r\nwho helped his boom along through the glowing accounts they wrote from\r\nday to day.\r\n\r\nUnder the impetus of the swirl in Rapid Transit, practically every\r\nproperty in the Street went flying upward, until the end did not seem to\r\nbe in sight. The bears were beaten to a standstill every time they\r\nshowed their heads, the only result of their attacks being that Flower\r\nstocks would jump up a notch higher. The ex-governor preached\r\nAmericanism and confidence, until everybody believed that if a stock was\r\nonly grounded, and the property located in America, you could buy it at\r\nany price and still be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThat a terrible panic did not grow out of this boom was due only to one\r\nfact: Mr. Flower’s sudden death. Had he lived thirty days longer, the\r\nbubble must have been pricked, and the result would have been\r\ndisastrous. Mr. Flower went to the country for a day’s rest, ate freely\r\nof ham and radishes and washed his frugal meal down with a copious\r\nsupply of ice water; he naturally, in consequence, died in a few hours\r\nafterwards of an attack of acute indigestion; his death alone saved the\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and his other wealthy friends rushed\r\ninto the market with millions and sustained values. They were in a\r\nposition to attribute the threatened reaction to his death and pointed\r\nout the absurdity of letting such an incident affect the value of\r\nstocks. They discounted the break that must have come in the natural\r\ncourse of events under the forcing process that was going on. Reasoning\r\nsuch as this spread broadcast through the papers stopped the break.\r\nWhere the bottom would have fallen out entirely there was only virtually\r\na moderate break all along the line; why it was not worse was due to the\r\nmarket being bolstered up by the Standard Oil Combination and others\r\nwith them coming to the rescue just in time to prevent a big smash. The\r\nsmall speculators operating on moderate margins were of course all wiped\r\nout almost to a man, but many of the big fellows were saved. It is\r\nprobably the only instance on record where the death of a big operator\r\nsaved a general smash. Those hurt were numerous politicians and small\r\nfry operators who instead of getting away with snug fortunes in the\r\nshape of profits, lost their all.\r\n\r\nAn interesting circumstance of the Flower boom was developed\r\ninvoluntarily by young Joe Leiter. Leiter himself, although he had gone\r\nto the wall some time previously, indirectly had brought about certain\r\nconditions that served Mr. Flower’s purpose admirably. These conditions\r\nwere the general release of hundreds of millions of dollars on mortgages\r\non farm lands. When Leiter began to corner wheat, it was ruling down in\r\nthe neighborhood of sixty cents a bushel. He lifted it to considerably\r\nover a dollar before he went broke. This enabled thousands of farmers to\r\nrealize on their crops at the dollar figure and above, which brought\r\nprosperity almost over night to the wheat growing belt. With the money\r\nrealized from their wheat the farmers paid off their mortgages to the\r\nextent of two or three hundred million dollars. These mortgages were\r\ngenerally held in the East. This released that much Eastern capital,\r\ncausing that vast volume of money to seek investment. The men\r\ncontrolling this money were overjoyed when Mr. Flower made an opening\r\nfor them through the Wall Street boom, and hence it was a comparatively\r\neasy matter for a time to push up values.\r\n\r\nJ. Pierpont Morgan, now a noted character, was trained as a clerk in the\r\none-time famous banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Co. Later he made a\r\nconnection with Anthony J. Drexel, probably the wealthiest banker in his\r\ntime in America. Out of this grew the house of Drexel, Morgan & Co.,\r\nwith Mr. Morgan as the managing partner in New York. When Mr. Drexel\r\ndied, Mr. Morgan absorbed the entire business, and a few years later\r\nwhen his father died, Mr. Morgan became the head of the London house of\r\nJ. S. Morgan & Co. as well. This put him in a very prominent position.\r\nHe soon thereafter demonstrated his influence by reorganizing the\r\nbankrupt Richmond & West Point Terminal Railway & Warehouse Co.,\r\nchanging its name to the Southern Railway Co. A number of small roads\r\nwere added to it, many of which were in financial straits, and\r\npractically all of them had been badly managed. He combined them into\r\none system under the one head. This railroad combination is now one of\r\nthe great properties of this country. Mr. Morgan next turned his\r\nattention to the reorganization of the Reading and the Erie roads, which\r\nwere in a bad way. He soon produced order out of chaos there, and that\r\nresulted in a boom in railroad stocks all along the line. He had several\r\nsharp tussles, however, with some of the big stock holders, who tried to\r\nstand out against him on account, as they thought, of his plans being\r\ntoo drastic; and during these tussles he not infrequently resorted to\r\nthe usual methods to break values, buying at the reduced prices so as to\r\nstrengthen his control.\r\n\r\nThe people who followed Mr. Morgan’s lead in these transactions\r\ngenerally made money.\r\n\r\nA different sort of deal was engineered a few years before by S. V.\r\nWhite, popularly known as Deacon White, because of his position as\r\ndeacon in Plymouth Church. Mr. White is one of the oldest operators in\r\nthe Street, and one of the most striking figures. He has made half a\r\ndozen great fortunes in speculation and lost them, but he is as\r\nundaunted as ever, and in spite of the fact that he is now over seventy\r\nyears old, he is still active daily in the market.\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most unique stock deals ever carried out in the\r\nStreet resulted from the transaction of Joseph Bannigan when President\r\nof the Rubber Trust. The history of this deal which for a time resulted\r\nin a great boom in industrials, has never been told, and is known to but\r\nvery few persons, most of whom, by the way, were its victims.\r\n\r\nBannigan was an uneducated Irishman who could hardly read and write. He\r\ncommenced life in a New England rubber factory and worked for $1.50 per\r\nday and died worth five million dollars. He was shrewd and bright and\r\nknew the value of money. He saved to such good purpose that when the\r\nRubber Trust was formed he was at the head of one of the biggest\r\nfactories in the country, located in Providence. His knowledge of the\r\ntrade was so thorough that despite the fact that he almost invariably\r\nused small i’s in writing a letter, he was made President of the Trust,\r\nhis holdings amounting to about forty thousand shares. When matters had\r\nbeen moving along for some time, Bannigan made up his mind that the\r\nother men in the trust, the big fellows, were not treating him right,\r\nand that the best thing he could do was to get out. So he packed his\r\nstock certificates in a grip sack, left Providence on the night boat,\r\nlanded in New York bright and early, had his breakfast and then made a\r\nbee line for a stock brokers’ office. He had assured himself in advance\r\nthat this stock broker was to be relied on and told him frankly what he\r\nintended to do.\r\n\r\n“I want to sell out bag and baggage,” he said. “I want to get rid of\r\nevery one of my forty thousand shares. Here they are, put them on the\r\nmarket and sell them.” The stock broker told him that that would never\r\ndo. If he wanted to realize full value for his holdings he would have to\r\ngo about it in a different way, for if he threw his forty thousand\r\nshares into the market it would knock the bottom out and he would get\r\nlittle or nothing for his stock. Mr. Bannigan saw the point, and asked\r\nwhat he was to do.\r\n\r\n“Buy,” said the broker.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to buy; I have got more now than I want.”\r\n\r\n“That is all right; buy anyway, that will make a market for the stock,\r\nand then you can unload when the time comes.”\r\n\r\n“How much must I buy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, about $250,000 worth.”\r\n\r\n“But I have not got $250,000 in cash to go and buy Rubber stock.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can borrow it; a man in your position, Mr. Bannigan, would\r\nhave no difficulty in borrowing $250,000.”\r\n\r\nMuch against his will the old man was finally persuaded to do as he was\r\ntold. About two weeks later the broker wrote to him that he must buy\r\nsome more, this time, $200,000 worth. Mr. Bannigan used rather strong\r\nlanguage, but finally yielded as he had before. He borrowed $200,000,\r\nand turned it over. With this additional capital to work on, the brokers\r\ncontinued to manipulate the market. The insiders soon discovered that\r\nsome strong party was buying; but they did not know who, Bannigan having\r\ncarefully kept himself in the background. His brokers operated skilfully\r\nin the stock, one day buying, the next, selling to keep the stock\r\nactive. The brokers after awhile commenced to borrow large amounts of\r\nthe stock. This convinced the insiders that there was a big short\r\ninterest somewhere, and they got together in order to squeeze the\r\nshorts. The inside holders who held most of the stock, who had combined\r\nto squeeze the shorts out, as they thought, put the price up to 61, and\r\nat about that figure Bannigan’s was all unloaded. Bannigan now found\r\nhimself full of money and the other fellows had his stock. They never\r\nawakened to the fact that the President had sold out on them until his\r\nshares were delivered against their purchases, as they thought, of short\r\nstock. Rubber soon thereafter did not stop tumbling until it had gone\r\nfrom 61 to 16. This deal had all the elements of a comedy-drama and the\r\nplaywright who can do it justice will find material there which will\r\nmake him an everlasting fortune and reputation. I have touched but\r\nlightly on a few of the important incidents. It is not often, however,\r\nthat newcomers in the Street fare as well as this in the end. For a time\r\nthey will go on merrily enough, and send things booming; but in the end\r\nmany get the worst of it. A. B. Stockwell is a good illustration of the\r\ntruth of this. He is still around the Street somewhere, but is one of\r\nthe “has beens,” like numerous other former conspicuously large and\r\nsupposed to be brilliant operators. At one time he was worth many\r\nmillions of dollars. To-day, he is upside down. His start in life was as\r\npurser on a Lake Erie steamboat; his father, it is said, kept a livery\r\nstable in Cleveland. On one of his trips, Stockwell was in a position to\r\nshow considerable attention to Elias Howe, the inventor of the eye at\r\nthe upper end of the sewing machine needle. Mr. Howe was accompanied by\r\nhis daughter. Stockwell made himself agreeable to Miss Howe also, and\r\nwith such good effect that he managed to win her affections and soon\r\nthereafter married the young lady. When Mr. Howe died, Mrs. Stockwell\r\ncame into possession of her father’s millions. With this nest egg\r\nStockwell started in Wall Street, and before anyone realized what had\r\nhappened he was the most talked of man in the district. He put all his\r\nwife’s millions into Pacific Mail stock, and secured entire control of\r\nthe Company. He came into the Street as plain Stockwell, then as the\r\nnews of his liberality and good fellowship spread, he became Mr.\r\nStockwell; after he got hold of Pacific Mail he was Commodore Stockwell,\r\nby common consent. Everybody bowed and scraped to him and no man was so\r\nhigh and mighty that he was not proud to shake his hand. Stockwell took\r\nhold of Pacific Mail at about 40 and sent it up to 107. It was at this\r\nperiod that he was worth over fifteen million dollars; but he found,\r\nunfortunately, when it was too late to retreat, that while Pacific Mail\r\nwas up to 107, it was not worth that figure when the unloading\r\ncommenced. He was landed high and dry with it all and the Street told\r\nhim he was welcome to it. He tried to sell, and found that there was no\r\nmarket. Then came violent demands on him to pay up his numerous call\r\nloans, and in order to respond thereto, he had to sell regardless of\r\nprice and thus created a whirlpool, which finally sent the stock down to\r\nthe price at which he commenced his original purchase at 40. In this one\r\nupset, he lost all his paper profits and his wife’s millions besides.\r\nThis catastrophe not only stripped him of all his worldly possessions,\r\nbut reduced him to the position of being plain Stockwell again, and\r\nthere are many also who even go so far as to call him “that little\r\nred-headed cuss.” That was the most famous boom in the history of\r\nPacific Mail, notwithstanding Leonard Jerome’s previous brilliant ups\r\nand downs in that former erratic property.\r\n\r\nLeonard and Addison Jerome had a good time with Pacific Mail for a\r\nwhile. They ran it up to high figures several times; but finally meeting\r\nwith the same experience that Stockwell did. The two Jeromes from being\r\namong the wealthiest and most dazzling operators in the Street, were in\r\nthe end practically wiped out. Leonard Jerome, who was the father of\r\nLady Randolph Churchill, had nothing left to bequeath his daughter\r\nexcept an equity in the house now occupied by The Manhattan Club on\r\nMadison Avenue, which yields an income of about $15,000 a year, of which\r\nLady Churchill gets $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the booms that have stirred up things in Wall Street\r\nat one time or another, as did the Keene booms, of which there were\r\nseveral, the Gould booms, and the Vanderbilt booms, all of which have\r\nbeen referred to in previous chapters in this book.\r\n\r\nThe question of trusts or trade combinations has, in recent years,\r\nexcited a good deal of interest. One of the most interesting figures in\r\nthis connection is John D. Rockefeller, who will undoubtedly be regarded\r\nby the future historian as a striking character in the business history\r\nof the nineteenth century. And be it remembered that history now\r\nconcerns itself, not so much with the doings of governments; not so much\r\nwith the personalities of emperors, kings, presidents or even with\r\npolitical parties, as with the life of the people themselves. This is\r\nclearly shown by such historians as Lord Macaulay and John Bach\r\nMcMaster. And looking at history in this way, surely John D. Rockefeller\r\nmust be regarded as one of the most interesting types of the great\r\ncommercial powers of the day. He was a pioneer, a commercial Daniel\r\nBoone, striking out into a new and untrodden field of enterprise, taking\r\ngreat risks, undergoing grave financial perils of a novel kind and at\r\nlength winning a complete and lasting success—a success which has filled\r\nbusiness history with his achievements and the world with his fame. It\r\nwas a great stride from the little farmhouse in Tioga County, New York,\r\nto the place which he fills to-day. Born in 1838 he is now in the prime\r\nof life. Reared by strict, church-going people, his word is as good as\r\nhis bond; he is the soul of business integrity, and a striking example\r\nof what thrift, enterprise and persistency will do for a young man who\r\nstarts out in life with apparently little or no chance of success. His\r\nold schoolmaster, it seems, was the first to get the young man to look\r\ninto the refining of petroleum. Not so many years ago, they used sperm\r\noil, and it cost $1.50 a gallon. How to refine the thick, ill-smelling\r\noil found in the water courses of Pennsylvania was a problem. It was\r\nblack slime, and John D. Rockefeller, by hitting upon a method of\r\nrefining it and introducing it in the home throughout the world has made\r\na fortune that recalls the fable of Midas. Before he was twenty-one he\r\nformed a partnership with a man named Hewitt and at first engaged in the\r\nwarehouse and produce business. Then came the great oil craze in\r\nPennsylvania. Poor farmers suddenly became rich; thousands flocked to\r\nthe oil fields. Young Rockefeller kept his head. Asked to make\r\ninvestments in oil wells for Cleveland friends he dissuaded them from\r\nthe project on the ground that the thing was being overdone, and with\r\nSamuel Andrews, who was familiar with the general processes of\r\ndistilling, engaged in the refining branch of the petroleum trade. The\r\nfirm subsequently became Rockefeller, Flagler & Andrews, which rapidly\r\nexpanded its field of operations, and in 1870 organized the Standard Oil\r\nCompany with a capital of $1,000,000. It started pipe lines to ship the\r\noil to the seaports. It made millions in by-products once considered\r\nworthless. It established markets all over the known world, cheapened\r\nits methods of production and outstripped all competitors. Little wonder\r\nthen, that its “extra” dividend in the year 1899 amounted to $23,000,000\r\nover and above the regular dividends on the whole capital stock. Mr.\r\nRockefeller attributes his success to early training and perseverance.\r\nThat is, like other men who have stamped their individuality upon the\r\naffairs of mankind, he is what is termed a causationist; in other words,\r\nhe believes that nothing is got for nothing; that effects proceed from\r\ncauses, and the cause of success he believes to be largely perseverance.\r\nHe believes that perseverance overcomes almost everything, even nature\r\nitself, and in that opinion this practical business man is at one with\r\nthe philosophers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nHe and his associates in the Standard Oil Company are naturally a power\r\nin the stock market. They are, of course, very large holders of railroad\r\nstocks and bonds and at times their influence is as irresistible as the\r\nlaws of gravitation. John D. Rockefeller’s influence alone could be so,\r\nas he is supposed to be the richest man in America and indeed the\r\nrichest man ever known in human history. His is believed to be the\r\ngreatest fortune ever accumulated by any man within his own lifetime.\r\nThat he feels the responsibilities of his great wealth is obvious from\r\nhis munificent gifts to educational and charitable institutions, to\r\nchurches and to a hundred other praiseworthy objects. His princely\r\ndonations to schools, colleges and universities rival those of that\r\nother public-spirited citizen, Andrew Carnegie. They are equally strong\r\nin their belief that the greatest charity lies in helping others to help\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\n          A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that it would be difficult to set bounds to the possibilities\r\nof American development. The inventive genius of the people, their\r\nadaptability to all circumstances, their tenacity of purpose, their\r\nwonderful energy, and the fabulous resources of the country all make it\r\ncertain that the United States will reach a degree of power and\r\nprosperity hitherto unexampled in human history. Carlyle’s “French\r\nRevolution,” has been strikingly described as “history read by flashes\r\nof lightning,” and I am tempted to use the same language in describing\r\nthe commercial revolution which has taken place in this country during\r\nthe last few years. Great as it is, however, I think it merely a prelude\r\nto what is to come. We are destined for one thing to have a great\r\nPacific trade. Fifty years ago, Humboldt said that the day would come\r\nwhen the trade of the Pacific Ocean would be as great as that of the\r\nAtlantic. And the increase within a year or two in this commerce augurs\r\nwell for the ultimate fulfillment of the great scientist’s prophecy. We\r\nreadily adapt ourselves to the requirements of foreign markets and that\r\nis a very important point. Lord Charles Beresford bears testimony to\r\nthis fact. He says with truth that Americans find out what the foreign\r\nmarkets want, then they supply it. The English say in effect, “We know\r\nwhat you want better than you know yourselves.” The American sends the\r\nChinese thirty-inch-wide calico, which is what they want; the Englishman\r\nsticks to twenty-seven inches, with the remark expressed or implied,\r\n“Take it or leave it.” And the Chinese will leave it rather than take it\r\nand the American manufacturer will be the gainer thereby. Minister Wu’s\r\nrecent remarks on the necessity of finding out just what the Chinese\r\nwant and then conforming to their wants, cannot be too carefully borne\r\nin mind. Furthermore, we are ready to adopt the newest and most highly\r\nperfected machinery regardless of cost. Mr. Carnegie, for instance, on a\r\nsingle occasion discarded machinery which had cost him $2,000,000, and\r\nreplaced it with the latest which inventive genius could supply. The\r\nLondon engineering journals, on the other hand, admit that the British\r\nmanufacturers will not change their machinery no matter how apparent it\r\nmay be that they are being distanced by their more progressive rivals in\r\nthis country. They reason that they have put just so much money into the\r\n“plant” and must get just so much out of it before they will replace it.\r\nThis seems a good deal like the ostrich which thrusts its head into the\r\nsand and refuses to look danger in the face. In the meantime the British\r\nare left behind in the race and Glasgow merchants have to try the\r\npuerile and utterly futile device of getting up a boycott against\r\nAmerican steel and iron products. Such a device, under the\r\ncircumstances, seems a good deal like the attempt of the celebrated Dame\r\nPartington, as the famous English wit Sidney Smith describes it, to\r\nsweep back the Atlantic Ocean. She trundled her mop vigorously and made\r\na gallant onslaught, but the Atlantic was aroused and it is needless to\r\nsay who was the victor. And the American iron trade’s invasion of\r\nEnglish markets must result in a victory, unless there is a radical\r\nchange in conditions, which no one can now foresee. We study the\r\nmarkets; we take pains to ascertain their wants, and it is an axiom of\r\ntrade that a man or nation that supplies the demand, whatever it may\r\nhappen to be, gets the trade. This is a law as inexorable, as\r\nunchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians.\r\n\r\nWe are now one of the five great world powers, financial and political,\r\nwith a population second to none except Russia. That is to say, we have\r\na population of 76,300,000, Germany has 55,000,000, Austro-Hungary\r\n45,000,000, the United Kingdom 41,000,000, France 39,000,000, Italy\r\n32,000,000, Spain 20,000,000, Russia 136,000,000, Japan, 45,000,000,\r\nIndia 340,000,000, China 400,000,000. The Mongolian race is numerically\r\npowerful, but in the long run can the yellow race stand up against the\r\nwhite? I doubt it. Meantime the population in this western home of the\r\nCaucasian race is steadily increasing. In 1800 the United States had a\r\npopulation of only 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. Then we had sixteen\r\nstates. Now we have forty-five. Then our territory consisted of 909,050\r\nsquare miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles. We have practically a\r\nnew race made up of an amalgamation of all branches of the Caucasian\r\nrace, speaking the English tongue, which in my judgment is destined to\r\nbe the one tongue spoken in the world. It is a people determined to\r\nuphold just and equitable principles of trade and to have sound money.\r\nThe amount now in circulation is $2,074,687,871, or an increase within\r\nthree years of $400,000,000. Russia has only 26,000 miles of railroad;\r\nwe have 190,000. In the last fifteen years we have made more progress in\r\nthe things which tend to increase practically the term of human life by\r\nannihilating time and space and supplying necessities and comforts of\r\none kind or another than ever before in our history. We are told that\r\nwhat does not happen in a year may happen in a minute. Similarly what\r\nmight not have happened in a thousand years under adverse conditions,\r\nhas happened in fifteen.\r\n\r\nWhat of the future? In the language of Daniel Webster, “the past at\r\nleast is secure.” We see that the bank exchanges which in 1888 were\r\n$48,750,886,813, have risen in 1900 to approximately $92,000,000,000.\r\nDuring four years of a sound money Republican Administration, exchanges\r\nin our clearing houses steadily increased from $48,750,886,813 in 1888,\r\nto the magnificent total of $60,883,572,438 in 1892. But from 1892,\r\nduring four years of Democratic rule, our clearings fell from\r\n$60,883,572,438 to $51,935,651,733 in 1896, running as low as\r\n$45,000,000,000 in 1894. From 1896, during Mr. McKinley’s\r\nAdministration, we gained on an average more than ten billions each\r\nyear, the exchanges having gone up from $51,935,651,733 in 1896, to the\r\nsurprising sum of $92,037,588,818 in 1900. From 1888 to 1892 during a\r\nRepublican Administration, we increased our exports $317,787,505,\r\nreaching the then gratifying figure of $1,015,732,011. From 1892 to\r\n1896, during a Democratic Administration, our exports decreased by\r\n$152,531,524, falling from $1,015,732,011 to $863,200,487. From 1896\r\ndown to June 30, 1900, with two months estimated, during McKinley’s\r\nAdministration, our exports have gone up from $863,200,487 in 1896, to\r\n$1,400,000,000, gaining $537,000,000, or nearly doubling; and of this\r\nvast export of $1,400,000,000 more than $400,000,000 are manufactured\r\ngoods, and would require in their production more than a million of\r\nAmerican mechanics.\r\n\r\nFrom the fall of 1888 to the fall of 1892, during a Republican\r\nAdministration, national banks gained in resources $694,400,000, going\r\nfrom $2,815,700,000 to $3,510,100,000. From the fall of 1892 to the fall\r\nof 1896, during a Democratic Administration, the national banks lost in\r\nresources $346,500,000, going down from $3,510,100,000 to\r\n$3,263,600,000. From the fall of 1896 to April 26, 1900, during\r\nMcKinley’s Administration, the national banks have gained in resources\r\n$1,548,356,000, going up from $3,263,600,000 to $4,811,956,000. The\r\nincrease in both Republican periods was constant and gradual throughout,\r\ndemonstrating, as has been well said, the influence and power of\r\nfar-reaching politics which alone can bring about uniform and universal\r\nprosperity worthy the genius of the American people. The Republican\r\nparty turned over the Government to the Democrats in March, 1893, with a\r\nbonded debt of only $585,029,330, and this was increased to\r\n$847,365,130, in times of peace. For the purpose of prosecuting the war\r\nthe debt was increased in 1898 by $200,000,000, and now stands at\r\n$1,046,048,750, less such an amount of the twenty-five millions of 2 per\r\ncent. bonds as the Secretary of the Treasury may have already redeemed.\r\nDuring the last four years of Democratic administration, $201,003,808 of\r\ngold was exported; while during the first three years of the recent\r\nAdministration, or down to June 30, 1899, we imported $201,071,000,\r\nmaking a difference in favor of Republican politics of $402,074,808.\r\nLook, too, at the per capita circulation in the United States. In 1802,\r\nit was $5.00; in 1845, $9.00; in 1873, $15.85; in 1892, $24.40; in 1900,\r\n$26.77.\r\n\r\nAs President McKinley pointed out in his message, our foreign trade for\r\nthe fiscal year of 1900 showed a remarkable record. The total of imports\r\nand exports for the first time in the history of the country exceeded\r\ntwo billions of dollars. The exports are greater than they have ever\r\nbeen before, the total for the fiscal year 1900 being $1,394,483,082, an\r\nincrease over 1899 of $167,459,780, an increase over 1898 of\r\n$163,000,752, over 1897 of $343,489,526, and greater than 1896 by\r\n$511,876,144. The growth of manufactures in the United States is\r\nevidenced by the fact that exports of manufactured products largely\r\nexceed those of any previous year, their value for 1900 being\r\n$433,851,756, against $339,592,146 in 1899, an increase of 28%.\r\nAgricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume\r\nthan in 1899, the total for the year being $835,858,123, against\r\n$784,776,142 in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe imports for the year amounted to $849,941,184, an increase over 1899\r\nof $152,792,695. The increase is largely in materials for manufacture,\r\nand is in response to the rapid development of manufacturing in the\r\nUnited States. While there was imported for use in manufactures in 1900\r\nmaterial to the value of $79,768,972 in excess of 1899, it is reassuring\r\nto observe that there is a tendency toward decrease in the importation\r\nof articles manufactured ready for consumption, which in 1900 formed\r\n15.17 per cent. of the total imports against 15.54 per cent. in 1899 and\r\n21.09 per cent. in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe election of November, 1900, stamped out of the minds of the people\r\nall fear that any sort of governmental policy in any way inimical to the\r\nfinances or business or prosperity of the country may be adopted. A very\r\ngreat factor in our future development, which our people are soon to\r\ndiscover, will appear in the building up of the ports of trade on the\r\nPacific Coast, which will be so extensive and rapid in progress that the\r\nAtlantic ports will before long begin to feel the competition of the\r\nWestern coast of our country. Our grasp of the Philippine Islands, and\r\nthe foothold in trade and greater share of confidence in our\r\ndisinterestedness as regards territorial encroachment which is fast\r\ngaining in the Chinese Empire, will finally consummate the preparations\r\nfor as great business and prosperity for the Pacific coast States as\r\nhave heretofore been enjoyed by those of the Atlantic coast. Soon a part\r\nof the trade and commerce of the Eastern States will be brought into\r\ncompetition with that of the great Pacific coast, insomuch that it will\r\nappear that indeed “Westward the star of empire takes its way.” It is\r\nthe foresight of such change in the Pacific States that has helped\r\nproduce such a pronounced electoral result.\r\n\r\nOur country is now passing through a rapid growth of progress and power\r\nand prestige which will soon place her in the leadership of the nations,\r\nwith every means necessary for extending civilization, enlightenment,\r\ncommerce and better government over the world. We have come to the time\r\nwhen we must take up the mighty work of further cultivating and\r\nimproving the condition of mankind, and we will continue this great work\r\nuntil our labors shall have brought to pass better conditions of\r\ngovernment, co-ordination of interests, education, and peace and good\r\nwill among the nations of the earth. In the progress of civilization\r\nsince the dawn of the Christian era, the momentous task of leadership\r\nhas devolved first upon Rome, then upon Spain, then upon England. It\r\nseems to have been reserved for the “Young Giant of the West” to\r\ncomplete the tasks undertaken, and assemble into one great community of\r\ninterest vast national forces which have been the growth of centuries.\r\nIn due time we shall no doubt finish the work and bring peace and good\r\nwill to men in every part of the world and prepare men everywhere to\r\nturn the spear into a pruning hook, the sword into a ploughshare and to\r\ngive freedom and protection and prosperity to all sorts and conditions\r\nof men, and put an end to strife between the nations. We believe that\r\nsuch is the great office to which we have been called, and that our\r\nfunctions as the leading nation of the world have already begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ALL THE PRECEDING PAGES WERE\r\n                  WRITTEN YEARS AGO, AND WHAT FOLLOWS\r\n                       BRINGS THE WORK UP TO THE\r\n                 DATE OF THIS ISSUE, MARCH 31ST, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n      MY CHRISTMAS ADDRESS TO CUSTOMERS DEC. 24,\r\n                              1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can now realize why we have for so long a period had a congested\r\nstock market. It started by the accumulation of Union Pacific by\r\ncomparatively few people, the purchases being commenced in 1903, the\r\npanic year, when the price dipped to 65. By the time the stock touched\r\n100 the accumulation was complete. Then the manipulation was begun for\r\nits advance to 190, at which time the ten per cent. dividend was\r\ndeclared, since which the process of distribution has been going on. St.\r\nPaul, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern have gone through a similar\r\nprocess. Prior to the declaration of the increased stock issues by these\r\ncompanies, the larger part of the old stock had been bought up by the\r\ninside knowing ones, after which the new issues were announced to the\r\npublic. The profit to the holders of these stocks can be measured by the\r\nmarket value of the rights. Now we all know what the large holdings of\r\nthese stocks meant. The inside magnates having nearly all of them, the\r\noutsiders were left out in the cold, and were consequently in the dark;\r\nbut now the light of day flashes over the situation. You are asked to\r\nbuy the rights which represent insiders’ profits, all of which is water\r\npure and simple. The accumulation of stocks has now ceased and\r\ndistribution is under way, and that is why the market has this present\r\nfit of liquidation, which must go on until completed. Then the situation\r\nwill have righted itself legitimately, and not until then. Remember what\r\nI tell you: that the accumulation of stock as I have described has\r\nproduced the present congested money market, and the unlocking of the\r\nformer will, after a short time, unlock the other; then all will be well\r\nagain. The present turbulent waves will pass over without many\r\nshipwrecks, and then will come calm weather and a smooth sea. Patience\r\nis a great virtue; exercise it, and wait for bottom; then get in and get\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is my Christmas greeting to you. You all have my best\r\nwishes for a happy and prosperous New Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\n              EDWARD H. HARRIMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward H. Harriman was born on Long Island in 1848. His father was a\r\nclergyman, and the family in poor circumstances. At the age of fourteen\r\nhe left school, and began his business career in a Wall Street house. Of\r\nan aggressive and masterful character, with a great capacity for hard\r\nwork and the ability to master every detail, he rapidly forged ahead. At\r\neighteen he became partner in a brokerage house; at twenty-two bought a\r\nseat on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1883 he was chosen a director of\r\nthe Illinois Central Railroad Company, and four years later, when he\r\nbecame its vice president, he retired from the brokerage business,\r\nhaving amassed what was then considered a comfortable fortune. For a\r\ntime, while President Fish was abroad, Mr. Harriman was acting president\r\nof the Illinois Central, and promptly put into execution his idea that\r\nthe way to make a road pay was to put it in the best of physical\r\ncondition, and thus attract traffic by the ability to handle it, rather\r\nthan by cutting rates. This policy afterwards brought the Union Pacific\r\nup from a financial and physical wreck in 1893 to the most aggressive\r\nand progressive railroad corporation of the day, operating, together\r\nwith the Southern Pacific, over 15,000 miles of road, besides\r\ncontrolling the Illinois Central, Chicago & Alton, and St. Joseph &\r\nGrand Island Railroad companies and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,\r\nand owning large interests in the Baltimore & Ohio, New York Central,\r\nAtchison, Chicago & Northwestern, and Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul\r\nroads. Mr. Harriman and his associates were defeated in an attempt to\r\nobtain control of the Northern Pacific in 1901, but the Union Pacific\r\nsystem benefited by this defeat, it is estimated, by about $60,000,000.\r\nThe purchase of Northern Pacific in the open market forced the price of\r\nits stock up to $1,000 per share on May 9, 1901, causing the memorable\r\npanic of that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\n       THE UPS AND DOWNS OF WALL STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ILLUSTRATED BY PERSONAL REMINISCENCES OF ITS LEADERS.\r\n\r\nThe mutations and vicissitudes, the ups and downs, of Wall Street can be\r\nbest illustrated by sketches, from life, of the career and experience of\r\nits leading operators, who have often, though not generally, gone up\r\nlike a rocket and come down like a stick.\r\n\r\nI will not begin with those now foremost in the Wall Street arena, but\r\ngo back to Jacob Little, whose name is still a household word on the\r\nStock Exchange.\r\n\r\nHe died in the sixties, while the war between North and South was\r\nraging, and he had gradually ceased to be a power in the Street after\r\nthe panic of 1857. He remained a bear on the rising tide of currency\r\ninflation following the outbreak of the war, and was submerged and wiped\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe was an odd fish—singular in appearance, manner, and business methods,\r\nbut for more than twenty years he had a great name in Wall Street. To\r\nspeak colloquially, he was the cock of the walk by self-assertion and\r\ncommon consent.\r\n\r\nHe was the successor of Jacob Barker, who came from Philadelphia, and\r\nwas the first great leader Wall Street had known. He was trained in his\r\noffice, and began as a stock operator on his own account in 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY H. ROGERS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1837 made his reputation and his fortune, for, being\r\nnaturally a bear, he was largely “short” of stocks. That panic swept the\r\nwhole United States with the besom of destruction, and sent prices down\r\nto zero. It left him a greater bear than ever, a preacher of distrust\r\nand a prophet of failure. He thrived on calamity, and grew richer and\r\nricher during the years of depression that followed that memorable\r\nrevulsion.\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 to 1846 he was in his glory and his prime, and no one disputed\r\nhis leadership in the world of Wall Street. But then he met with a great\r\nreverse, not, however, through continuing to “bear” stocks, but through\r\na “bull” operation in Norwich and Worcester Railroad stock. He\r\nattempted, with a Boston clique, to control it, and personally bound\r\nhimself to the clique, in the sum of $25,000, not to sell his stock\r\nbelow 90.\r\n\r\nHe went to work to put it up, but it “bulled hard,” and refused to stay\r\nup. So he paid the forfeit, and sold out at the best prices he could\r\nget, losing a million, which was looked upon in those days as ten or\r\ntwenty millions would be now. This was the only large bull operation he\r\never engaged in, and it confirmed him in his natural bearishness.\r\n\r\nHe more than recovered from this disaster, however, by breaking the\r\n“corner” in Erie stock not long afterwards. He was largely “short” of\r\nit, and the cornering clique had bought up all the stock on the market.\r\nThey put the price higher and higher from day to day, but Jacob Little\r\nremained unterrified, and refused to “cover” his contracts. He was the\r\nonly one “short” who stood out against the cornerers, and made no effort\r\nto buy in his stock. The eyes of all Wall Street were watching him, and\r\nthe prevailing opinion was that he would be forced to “cover” at a\r\nruinous loss, or fail.\r\n\r\nBut he had “a card up his sleeve” that the cornerers had never\r\nsuspected, and just when they were expecting his surrender, or failure,\r\nat the maturity of his contracts to deliver, he produced a big bundle of\r\nnew Erie certificates of stock and filled his contracts by delivering\r\nthem. These had been issued to him in exchange for the company’s\r\nconvertible bonds, unknown to the clique, the issue of the bonds with\r\nthe convertible clause being also unknown to them.\r\n\r\nSuch a surprise and checkmate Wall Street had never known before, and\r\nthe “corner” was broken, with resulting demoralization and disaster to\r\nthe cornering clique, and great profit and eclat to Jacob Little. But\r\nsubsequently he failed several times on the “bear” side, yet always\r\nmanaged to pay in full out of later successes. He was equally generous\r\nas a creditor, and compromised on easy terms, so as to give his debtors\r\na chance to recuperate. Hence he was liked and respected notwithstanding\r\nhis aggressiveness and the havoc he often wrought among speculators on\r\nthe opposite side of the market.\r\n\r\nHe was a born speculator. Speculation was his daily bread. He liked it\r\nfor its own sake. His ambition was to control the stock market, and he\r\nwas willing to run extra hazardous risks to achieve this end. He once\r\nsaid: “I care more for the game than the results, and, winning or\r\nlosing, I like to be in it!”\r\n\r\nIt was this feeling that kept him in Wall Street after his money power\r\nand his prestige of success, as well as his health, had passed away. He\r\nwas out of debt, but without money in any considerable amount. He was a\r\nmere shadow of what he had been, a name and nothing more. Nevertheless,\r\nhe risked his small operations with zest. But his health gave way more\r\nand more, and he fainted one morning in the board room, in Lord’s Court,\r\nand his end came not long afterwards.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I die poor!” But from the ashes of his estate and unsettled\r\naccounts his family succeeded in collecting about $150,000, which he had\r\nneglected to look after, for he had always been careless and easy-going\r\nin money matters, and attached little value to money except for its use\r\nin speculation. He was the very reverse of a miser, for he had never\r\ncared to hoard.\r\n\r\nIt was Anthony W. Morse who gave the finishing stroke to the career of\r\nJacob Little, for, while Little was operating for a decline in the early\r\nsixties, Morse sprang into the speculative ring as a rampant bull, and\r\nbid prices up on the Stock Exchange, while it was still in Lord’s Court,\r\nin a way that astonished him and the other fossils of the board. They\r\nconsidered him utterly reckless. But Morse foresaw that the great war\r\nissues of United States currency—greenbacks as they were called—then\r\nbeing made would inflate the prices of stocks largely, and he\r\naccordingly, metaphorically speaking, rushed in where angels feared to\r\ntread.\r\n\r\nHe became the storm center, the hub, the pivotal point, in the wildest\r\nriot of stock speculation this country has ever known, or probably ever\r\nwill know again; and who was he? A slight, fair-complexioned country\r\nlad, he came to New York without a dollar, and became a clerk in a\r\nstockbroker’s office. Then he married a woman with some money, and\r\ninduced her to let him speculate a little for her, and was successful in\r\nmaking something for her, and enough for himself to buy a seat at the\r\nStock Exchange, which then cost only $500, the initiation fee.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1862, up to which time he was both insignificant and\r\nunknown. But the bold, dashing style in which he immediately began to\r\nastonish the natives and rattle the dry bones of the fossils, by his\r\nrapidly advancing bids for railway stocks, showed that he was a man of\r\nthe time, fully up to date. Had he not proved to be right on the market\r\nhe would have been ruined at the start, but the market went with him,\r\nand it went with a rush that made the old fogies of the board say:\r\n“Well, well! this young fellow got the start of us—we are not in it!”\r\n\r\nHe first put up Cleveland & Pittsburg with the ease and celerity of a\r\nman who thought it a mere trifle to handle. Then he successfully took\r\nhold of Ohio & Mississippi, Rock Island, Erie, and Fort Wayne, and put\r\nthem up in the same pyrotechnical and flamboyant way. He, in one day,\r\nmarked Fort Wayne up from 118 to 152. He had unlimited confidence in\r\nhimself, because he saw that he was on the right track, and the Street\r\nand the public followed him. He ran Pittsburg up from 65 to 108 amid\r\ngreat excitement, and bid 100 for the whole capital stock, “seller one\r\nyear.” He then sold all his Pittsburg between 96 and 108. His firm,\r\nMorse & Co., were overrun with commission business at their large\r\nground-floor office in William Street. By the early part of 1863 he had\r\npunished the bears badly, and made, it was estimated, at least\r\n$1,250,000, and his career of riotous success ran for just two years,\r\nduring which he was supposed to have made enormously. There was a rush\r\nto join every pool he formed, so great was his prestige. Men crowded the\r\nsidewalk in front of his office trying to find out what he said, or what\r\nhe was doing, so that they might do likewise; and if he gave a “bull”\r\npoint on any stock, nearly all who heard of it acted upon it, feeling\r\nconfident that it was a dead certainty. His fellow-brokers in the board\r\nlargely followed him, like the rank and file, and rag, tag, and bobtail\r\nof the Wall Street crowd, because he had been always right. Never indeed\r\nwas a Wall Street leader, before or since, more blindly followed than\r\nMorse. The whole country joined in the mad speculation there, and he was\r\non the crest of the wave.\r\n\r\nOne night at the Evening Exchange Morse bid 112 for 10,000 shares of\r\nErie stock, and Daniel Drew sold them. Then he bid the same price for\r\n20,000 more, and Drew sold them. A day or two later Drew “covered” at a\r\nheavy loss. When Morse took hold of Ohio & Mississippi he jumped it from\r\n49 to 69 in a couple of days.\r\n\r\nMoney was cheap and abundant, owing to the currency inflation, and\r\nspeculation so active that many stock houses kept a relay of clerks for\r\nnight work. Meanwhile speculation in gold was as rampant as in stocks,\r\nand hundreds of new mining and petroleum companies were launched, and\r\nthe stocks of these were actively traded in at high and rapidly rising\r\nprices, while old and worthless stocks, like Bucks County Lead, were\r\nresuscitated and boomed with the rest.\r\n\r\nClergymen and women were drawn into this whirlpool of speculation, and\r\nany stock with “gold” in its name went off “like hot cakes.” One stock\r\nwas considered about as good as another to buy, as all were going up.\r\nMorse led the crazy multitude in everything, and, among his other\r\nachievements, he put Rock Island up from 106 to 149, and, in doing so,\r\nbought the whole capital stock, which was then only 56,000 shares.\r\n\r\nMorse’s doom was sealed by Mr. Salmon P. Chase, who as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury sought to stop the wild inflation, and particularly the\r\ntremendous bull speculation in gold, by selling gold for currency, and\r\nlocking the currency up in the Sub-treasury, so as to make a tight money\r\nmarket. This had the desired effect, for it made money so scarce and\r\ndear that it forced the large speculative holders of stocks to sell,\r\nthrough the banks calling in their loans, and brought on a panic, just\r\nat the time when Morse was more heavily loaded with stocks than he had\r\never been before.\r\n\r\nBroken in health, and looking weary and haggard, he tried to sell, and\r\nthis set every one of his followers selling like a flock of sheep, and\r\nprices tumbled from bad to worse under the general rush to realize. Fort\r\nWayne fell at the morning session of the board on that fatal Monday of\r\nthe Morse panic, on the 18th of April, 1864, from 153 to 119. Then Morse\r\nleft the room for the last time, and, going to his office, said to his\r\npartner, “The game is up!” Reading had also fallen that morning nineteen\r\nper cent.; Pittsburg, seventeen; Hudson River, twenty-three; and all\r\nother active stocks about as much.\r\n\r\nThis monetary tornado, that found Morse overloaded with stocks, there\r\nand then swept him out of the Stock Exchange, for, knowing that he was\r\nhopelessly ruined, he wrote an announcement of the suspension of Morse &\r\nCo., and sent it to the board a few minutes after he had left it. The\r\nfailure proved a very bad one, and the firm was unable to settle or\r\nresume. Morse was no longer the leader of Wall Street, and many of his\r\ncustomers, in a semifrantic condition, rushed in upon him and denounced\r\nhim bitterly. The king had been dethroned, never to regain his crown,\r\nnor ever to get a fresh start.\r\n\r\nPandemonium reigned during the rest of the day, and at the Evening\r\nExchange uptown at night Speculation had been so widespread, and Morse\r\nhad been so implicitly trusted as a leader, that the collapse ruined\r\nthousands, including many women, and a raving, cursing mob crowded into\r\nthe Evening Exchange and overflowed into the Fifth Avenue Hotel. There\r\nwas a night of horror in hundreds of homes. Morse was upbraided and\r\ncursed, and many of his customers, as is usual when they lose their\r\nmoney in a broker’s office, blamed him for their losses.\r\n\r\nThen for a year Morse disappeared. When he returned he looked more\r\nhaggard than ever, and he died poor soon afterwards. No one ever accused\r\nMorse of being dishonest, therefore his Waterloo defeat gained him\r\nwidespread sympathy. Few Wall Street magnates had more friends than\r\nAnthony W. Morse from start to finish of his career.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Tobin, who had been a ferry gatekeeper for Commodore Vanderbilt\r\non Staten Island, figured largely as a speculator in the gold room, and\r\nalso as a stock operator, during the two years of the Morse campaign,\r\nand saw many ups and downs. He began to loom up still more after Morse\r\nsank below the horizon in 1864. He was known to be the agent of\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt in cornering Harlem stock, and shone in\r\nVanderbilt’s reflected light, although a large operator on his own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe Harlem “corner” was a memorable event. Through the winter of 1863-64\r\nthe stock had been selling at about 60, and Vanderbilt was a director\r\nand large stockholder, and, moreover, determined to make what he called\r\n“a big thing” out of it. The road was, however, generally considered of\r\nlittle account except for carrying milk. So, in connection with his\r\nstreet-railway projects for improving its value, he engineered the stock\r\nup to 117. He counted upon getting a charter from the Common Council;\r\nbut its members tricked him, and after passing a favorable resolution\r\nthey sold the stock “short” and then rescinded the resolution, and it\r\nfell to 72. So they made money at his expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ARCHBOLD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then applied to the Legislature at Albany for a Harlem franchise to\r\nlay rails in Broadway; and the legislators saw there was room for stock\r\nspeculation in this. They made a favorable report on a bill granting\r\nVanderbilt’s application, and on this Harlem stock rose sharply to 150.\r\nThen they and their friends, including the New York Common Councilmen,\r\nsold it short largely, thinking they had a sure thing; and Tobin bought\r\nfor Vanderbilt all that was offered. On March 25, 1864, they voted, by\r\nprearrangement, against the bill, and Harlem stock fell to 101.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of Harlem rejoiced, for they had large profits on paper; but\r\nTobin still continued to buy the stock, and under his purchases it\r\nrapidly recovered. The commodore was determined to punish them. Within\r\nten days Harlem was up to 150 again. A week later it touched 185, and\r\nthereafter, for ten days, fluctuated between 175 and 200. Daniel Drew\r\nsold calls on it for 30,000 shares, thinking it could not stay up long,\r\nand the professional speculators, both in and out of the Stock Exchange,\r\ntook a hand in selling it “short” on the same theory. The Morse panic\r\nswept over it in April, but still it stood up, like a pyramid in the\r\ndesert, and Tobin still continued buying for Vanderbilt.\r\n\r\nIn May the price of Harlem was put up to 300. It stood at 285 on the day\r\n15,000 shares had to be delivered, and they were settled for at this\r\nprice. Daniel Drew compromised by paying $1,000,000 to Tobin in\r\nsettlement of his own Harlem “shorts,” but the claim against him was\r\n$1,700,000. He, however, threatened a suit for conspiracy. Tobin’s share\r\nof the profits of the corner was about two millions, and this made him\r\nworth three.\r\n\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt chuckled, and disposed of the Harlem road by\r\nleasing it at eight per cent. on the stock to the New York Central &\r\nHudson when he got control of it. So Harlem proved a bonanza to him till\r\nthe end, and is still one of the splendid assets of his descendants.\r\nAfter the “corner,” Tobin bulled gold on a tremendous scale in the face\r\nof the Union victories that terminated the war. He bulled it from 198 to\r\n211 against the “short” interest at the beginning of 1865, and then it\r\nbroke on him so heavily that he lost more than $1,500,000. After that he\r\nmet with a succession of disasters in the stock market, and lost every\r\ndollar that he had, besides running in debt with his brokers. He then\r\nretired to live with his sister on a farm on Staten Island, and was\r\nnever seen again in Wall Street. He saw ups and downs with a vengeance.\r\nSo did his contemporary of the open board, E. A. Coray, who made and\r\nlost about as much.\r\n\r\nAddison G. Jerome had a career in Wall Street more brief than that of\r\nAnthony W. Morse, but he is still well remembered there as a shining\r\nlight. He entered Wall Street as an operator early in 1863, after being\r\na merchant in the dry goods trade, and during the rest of that year was\r\ncalled “the Napoleon of the public board,” so conspicuously active,\r\nbold, and successful was he in his operations. He was a friend and\r\nbroker of John Tobin’s, and coöperated with him in bulling Harlem, with\r\nthe result that he made a very large amount of money out of it, first by\r\nthe rise from 60 to 117, when Commodore Vanderbilt was dealing with the\r\nNew York Common Council, and next when he was punishing the legislators\r\nat Albany for going back on him, as he phrased it, in the 1864 “corner.”\r\n\r\nHe became a brilliant leader, and had a host of followers, and was\r\nsuccessful in everything he undertook until he bulled Michigan Southern,\r\nand, with a clique that he formed, bought control of it. He put it to\r\nhigh figures, and was sure of his position. But Henry Keep, the\r\ntreasurer of the company, and a keen operator in stocks, stepped in, and\r\nturned Jerome’s success into utter and disastrous failure.\r\n\r\nHenry Keep knew something that Jerome was unaware of, namely, that a\r\nclause in the Michigan Southern’s charter permitted its directors to\r\nincrease its capital stock. So he called a secret meeting of the board,\r\nand an increase of 14,000 shares was voted. Then, with this increase for\r\nfuture delivery, he sold the stock against it, and borrowed to make his\r\ndeliveries, which made Jerome think Keep was largely “short” of Michigan\r\nSouthern. He and his clique, therefore, kept on buying and advancing the\r\nprice, while Keep kept on selling more and more. The final result was\r\nthat Jerome called in all his loans of the stock, so as to force the\r\n“shorts” to “cover,” and that Keep responded by delivering the 14,000\r\nshares of new stock, which caused a fall of twenty per cent. in Michigan\r\nSouthern in one day. This involved the loss of nearly all the three\r\nmillions of money Jerome had so quickly made, and killed him as a\r\nleader, although he was respected as an honorable man. He took the loss\r\nof his fortune and prestige so much to heart that he sickened and died\r\nin the following year of some obscure disease, a virtually ruined man.\r\nBut, fortunately, during his nine months of phenomenal success he had\r\nsettled enough on his wife to keep the wolf from the door. His ups and\r\ndowns were remarkably swift even for Wall Street.\r\n\r\nLeonard W. Jerome, a younger brother of Addison’s, was prominent in Wall\r\nStreet and society, and as the driver of a four-in-hand, long before the\r\nlatter appeared, and continued in the Street long after Addison passed\r\naway. His career was also marked by memorable ups and downs. In 1863 he\r\nwas a large holder of Hudson River Railroad stock, which the bears had\r\nhammered down to 107. So he formed a strong clique to bull it against\r\nthe “short” interest, and bought all the stock that was offered until he\r\nhad taken nearly all the capital. Then he bid up the price gradually\r\ntill it reached 175, and made the stock so scarce that he loaned it to\r\nthe bears to make their deliveries, at five per cent. a day. The shorts,\r\nestimated to represent about 50,000 shares, finding there was no help\r\nfor them, covered at a very heavy loss, while Jerome made a great deal\r\nof money by squeezing them, presumably two or three millions.\r\n\r\nHis prestige increased with his wealth, and he became a social as well\r\nas a financial lion. He had been watching Pacific Mail since it\r\nsucceeded the Nicaragua Transit Company in 1856. In 1861 its stock fell\r\nto 69, but in the next year its earnings were enormous, and 26,000 of\r\nits 40,000 shares were bought by a combination of operators, mostly its\r\ndirectors, who transferred it to Brown Brothers & Co., to be held in\r\ntrust for their benefit for five years; and they selected Leonard Jerome\r\nto bull the stock in the open market. Under his manipulation it rose to\r\n160 in thirteen months after he commenced operations for the ring. There\r\nwas a large “short” interest in it by that time, and, to force the\r\n“shorts” to settle, he put it to 200, and kept it there, and they\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Pacific Mail’s capital was increased from four millions to ten,\r\nand yet its stock stood at 240, and it paid twenty per cent. a year in\r\ndividends. The year after, it was increased to twenty millions, yet it\r\nsold at 180, with Jerome still bulling it. But in 1867 he met his\r\nWaterloo in it. To use his own words, he had bitten off more than he\r\ncould chew. The company’s earnings fell off largely, and its report\r\nshowed assets reduced from thirty-four to twenty-two millions; the\r\nGovernment paper-money issues were being rapidly contracted, and the\r\nflood of “water” injected into the stock was beginning to tell upon it.\r\nMoreover, Jerome had agreed to buy the old five-year combination’s stock\r\nat 160. Owing to all this, accompanied by a generally weak stock market,\r\nPacific Mail broke, under enormous sales, from 163 to 115 in a few days\r\non his hands, and he lost practically everything he had, except some\r\nreal estate. After being thus ruined by Pacific Mail, Leonard Jerome\r\nceased to be a power in Wall Street. He had no longer any prestige\r\nthere, and soon retired from it entirely, and died, at the home of his\r\ndaughter, Lady Randolph Churchill, in London, a poor man. He had\r\nexperienced his full share of the ups and downs of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nPacific Mail was nothing to Leonard W. Jerome after he lost his money,\r\nnor he to Pacific Mail. The company had seen its most palmy and\r\nprosperous days, and its water-logged stock was heavy on the market. It\r\nsuffered from reduced traffic and bad management, and in 1871-72 its\r\nstock had sunk to so low an ebb that the directors felt it was necessary\r\nto do something to mend matters. So, having little of the stock, they\r\ndecided, instead of trying to reëlect themselves, to give up the ship.\r\nThey retired to make room for a new board in November, 1871, with Alden\r\nB. Stockwell at the helm as president. Nominally the new board selected\r\nhim, but really he selected them to do his bidding.\r\n\r\nHis name was then very little known in Wall Street, but he was known to\r\nhave been a steamboat clerk on Lake Erie, and more recently to have\r\nmarried the daughter of Elias Howe, the sewing-machine inventor and\r\nmanufacturer of Bridgeport, Conn., and thus acquired wealth and become\r\nthe president of the Howe Sewing Machine Company and the Willcox & Gibbs\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nHe had come to Wall Street to see what he could do, and finding Pacific\r\nMail stock down to the 40’s in 1871, he began to bull it with a vigor\r\nthat excited some wonder; and the wonder grew when it was found that he\r\nhad secured stock and proxies enough to elect his own board of\r\ndirectors. He elected them and himself by a vote of 118,000 shares, and\r\nbecame Commodore Stockwell at a bound. His wish was law to his\r\ncodirectors, and the irreverent called it a dummy board.\r\n\r\nWith the assets of the Pacific Mail Company under his control, and\r\nacting for it, he soon managed to get control, and become president, of\r\nthe Panama Railway Company. He began, on this acquisition of the Pacific\r\nMail Company, to bull Pacific Mail stock anew by making splendid\r\npromises. In October, 1872, while the company’s steamers were foundering\r\nand burning with alarming frequency, he claimed that it had increased\r\nits property by large purchases, and was earning more than eleven per\r\ncent. a year in excess of the Government subsidy. This, he said, would\r\nenable it to pay twelve per cent. on its capital stock from January 1,\r\n1872. Then he asked for authority from the Legislature at Albany to\r\nreduce its capital stock from twenty millions to ten, which was granted;\r\nbut the company never availed itself of this authority, and to this day\r\nits capital remains at twenty millions.\r\n\r\nThe stock, that had been as low as 40, responded to his “bull”\r\nstatements and manipulation, for Wall Street saw that the intention was\r\nat least to put the stock up. It rose, after a good deal of see-sawing,\r\nto about 107, and Commodore Stockwell was the sensation of the time in\r\nWall Street. He became, like Leonard W. Jerome, what was called a “big\r\nswell.” He had one of the largest houses in Madison Avenue and one of\r\nthe showiest turnouts in the city, and yet he had been commodore for\r\nless than a year.\r\n\r\nHe did not confine himself to Pacific Mail and the other interests\r\nmentioned, but took hold of that railway cripple, Boston, Hartford and\r\nErie, and bought 30,000 shares of Atlantic and Pacific Railway preferred\r\nat 25, a stock of uncertain legal status, although the certificates had\r\nbeen printed by the company, because there was no legal authority for\r\nits issue. But this did not prevent the stock from being made active for\r\na short time in Wall Street at prices a good deal above cost.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, it became discredited, and so also did Boston,\r\nHartford and Erie stock, while Pacific Mail suffered under fresh losses\r\nand reduced earnings. The stocks of the three companies were vigorously\r\nattacked by the bears and they all went down together, Stockwell being\r\nunable to support them, and all that he had made was lost. This state of\r\nthings involved him in a snarl about the 27,000 shares of the Pacific\r\nMail Company’s treasury stock, and a compromise was the result, by which\r\nhe is said to have given his note to the Pacific Mail Company for\r\n$1,140,000, indorsed by the Howe Sewing Machine Company.\r\n\r\nThen, at the next election, he ceased to be its president, and a new\r\nboard of directors was elected. He was also dropped from the Panama\r\nRailroad directorate and the Atlantic and Pacific board. He had lost his\r\nmoney and his prestige, and there were none so poor as to do him\r\nreverence. He led a precarious existence as a small speculator\r\nafterwards, and, not long before his death, failed for a small amount as\r\na member of the Consolidated Exchange.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of popular manners, and, in describing his change of\r\nfortune, he humorously remarked: “When I first came into Wall Street, it\r\nwas asked, ‘Who is that man Stockwell?’ But I was respectfully spoken of\r\nas ‘Mr. Stockwell’ after I had made a good deal of money bulling Pacific\r\nMail; and when I was elected president of Pacific Mail, I was styled\r\n‘Commodore Stockwell’ and ‘a Wall Street leader,’ and a great man\r\ngenerally. But when Pacific Mail broke, and broke me, I became ‘That\r\nred-headed cuss Stockwell.’” Thus are the ups and downs of Wall Street,\r\nand Wall Street opinion, illustrated in real life.\r\n\r\nOf all the great operators of Wall Street, however, Daniel Drew\r\nfurnishes the most remarkable instance of immense and long-continued\r\nsuccess, followed by utter failure and hopeless bankruptcy. His early\r\nsuccess as a stock speculator was all the more surprising because he was\r\nan illiterate man, who had barely learned to read and to write enough to\r\nbe able to sign his own name in a sprawling, illegible hand.\r\n\r\nHe had been a cattle drover, and after that the keeper of the Bull’s\r\nHead Tavern, at the New York Cattle Yards, and was without any\r\nexperience of banking or Stock Exchange affairs when he first came into\r\nWall Street; and he never even read a newspaper. But he succeeded in\r\nmaking money from the start, and then joined others in putting capital\r\ninto Hudson River steamboats; and his investments in these became large\r\nand proved very profitable, although he knew nothing about running\r\nsteamers himself.\r\n\r\nHis shrewdness enabled him to make millions by stock speculation, and\r\nbefore long, without knowing anything of the stock brokerage business\r\nexcept as a customer, he entered into a Stock Exchange partnership, his\r\nfirm being Drew & Robinson. For many years this house was prosperous and\r\nprominent, and Drew, after it was dissolved, and when at the summit of\r\nhis prosperity, said to a friend who rated him at twenty millions, “I\r\nguess sixteen will cover it.”\r\n\r\nAfter that Drew’s cunning and sagacity seemed gradually to fail him. He\r\nmet with a succession of disasters through bad judgment, but was more\r\nliberal than before in endowing the Drew Theological Seminary and other\r\nMethodist institutions. Yet, instead of giving the endowments in cash,\r\nhe gave his notes for them, and paid interest on these. The consequence\r\nwas that when he finally lost every dollar that he had, and was declared\r\na bankrupt, without any assets, the notes were worthless. While in this\r\nbankrupt condition and dependent for a home on his son, he died, and his\r\ndeath was as unnoticed as that of any other Wall Street wreck. He had\r\ngone out of sight, and out of mind, when his money was gone. Never did\r\nanyone go further up or further down in Wall Street as a stock\r\nspeculator than Daniel Drew.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Woerishoffer was a brilliant Stock Exchange operator, who\r\nmade a large fortune out of nothing and then lost most of it again by\r\noverstaying his market as a bear after the panic of 1884.\r\n\r\nJames R. Keene came to New York with several millions, made out of\r\nmining stocks in California at the time of the great Bonanza gold\r\ndiscovery at Gold Hill, when Flood and O’Brien, Mackay, and John P.\r\nJones made their millions. But Keene, after adding to his “pile,” lost\r\nall he had through overextending his operations in bulling stocks and\r\ngrain in the eighties. He, however, got a fresh start through being\r\nemployed by large interests to manipulate stocks for them, and after\r\nseveral more ups and downs he is rich again.\r\n\r\nHenry N. Smith, a former partner of Jay Gould, made five or six millions\r\nas an operator in stocks, only to lose them again and die poor. The\r\nbrief meteoric Wall Street career of Ferdinand Ward, who lured General\r\nGrant into forming the firm of Grant & Ward, is well remembered. He went\r\nup so high that when he came down he landed in Sing Sing prison. Fish,\r\nthe president of the Marine Bank, did the same, after being long in good\r\nrepute.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dilate on any of the Vanderbilts, or Goulds, or\r\nRussell Sage, or Henry Keep, or Henry Villard, or William E. Travers,\r\nbecause they had no totally overwhelming reverses in their Wall Street\r\ncareer; but John F. Tracy, the president of the Rock Island Railroad in\r\nthe sixties, was ruined by his stock speculations after being worth more\r\nthan five millions, and he had to relinquish his presidency, and died in\r\npoverty. Cyrus W. Field, too, lost nearly all his large fortune through\r\noverloading himself with Manhattan Railway stock; and Addison Cammack,\r\nthe Ursa Major of Wall Street, died worth little in comparison with what\r\nhe had once possessed.\r\n\r\nHow violent the vicissitudes of Wall Street are at times we may easily\r\ninfer when we recall the tremendous convulsion produced by the gold\r\nconspiracy of Black Friday, on September 24, 1869, which involved\r\nthousands in enormous losses, and caused both the Stock Exchange and the\r\nGold Clearing House, and Gold Exchange Bank, to be closed; or when we\r\nthink of the devastating Northern Pacific panic of May 9, 1901, or of\r\nthe far-reaching and long-continued havoc worked by the panic of 1873.\r\n\r\nThe memorable failure of Jay Cooke & Co., early in the last-mentioned\r\npanic, will be recalled by many as vividly as the collapse of the Ohio\r\nLife and Trust Company that started the panic of 1857.\r\n\r\nAll these reminiscences of the ups and downs of Wall Street will serve\r\nto remind my readers that, while it is often easy to make money, it is\r\nstill easier to lose it. Therefore, boldness should be always tempered\r\nwith caution in the pursuit of the Almighty Dollar in Wall Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\n           RECENT WALL STREET BOOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESISTLESS POWER BEHIND THE MARKET.—THE ADVENT OF GOVERNOR R. P.\r\n    FLOWER.—HOW STOCKS WERE BOOMED WITH A DASH.—A SUDDEN DEATH AVERTS A\r\n    BIG PANIC.—MR. MORGAN AS A RAILWAY REORGANIZER.—HOW BANNIGAN\r\n    UNLOADED HIS RUBBER.—MILLIONS WON ONLY TO BE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street, after the election of McKinley, enjoyed a boom such as it\r\nhas seldom known. Probably the most interesting feature about this boom\r\nwas that it was not in any sense spectacular. In that respect it is\r\nunique. Prices of stocks went higher and the intrinsic value of most of\r\nthem was greater than ever before. The market had all the qualities that\r\nnormally would cause intense excitement and focus the attention of the\r\nentire country on the Stock Exchange. Yet in spite of these conditions\r\nthe Street was in a normal state of mind, and it is doubtful if the\r\ngeneral mass of the people, who get their information from the\r\nnewspapers, were aware that there was even an ordinary boom in Wall\r\nStreet. This unusual condition was due, I believe, to the fact that the\r\nboom we were enjoying was built on a foundation that reached clear to\r\nthe bowels of the earth. There was nothing unnatural or artificial about\r\nit. Wall Street, instead of being the center, is simply one of the\r\ncenters that reflects the general prosperity throughout the country.\r\nFarmers, merchants, mechanics, mill workers, and miners are all so\r\nintent on keeping pace with the progress in their own pursuits that they\r\nhave no time to cast eyes our way. The same conditions that boom stocks\r\nmay boom everything else in the country at an equal rate, so that we are\r\nin nowise deserving of special attention.\r\n\r\nAnother factor, too, had developed in the Street that prevented the\r\nusual excitement and hurly-burly incident to a rising market. This was\r\nthe absence of a pronounced central figure. Usually a boom centers about\r\nsome one man who stands boldly out in the open, and whose hand is known\r\nto be manipulating values. But then the manipulation was being carried\r\non by a method that was as quiet as it was novel and unusual. That the\r\nmarket was being manipulated was apparent enough even to the most casual\r\nobserver. But the source of this manipulation was probably known to only\r\na few.\r\n\r\nThey knew that a new order of things had come, due to the most powerful\r\ninfluence that had ever manifested itself in Wall Street. This influence\r\nwas very largely composed of the Standard Oil combination, who\r\nintroduced in their Wall Street operations the same quiet,\r\nunostentatious, but resistless measures that they had always employed in\r\nthe conduct of their corporate affairs. The heretofore conspicuously big\r\noperators were mere tyros beside the men who are running things for us\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAt his best, Jay Gould was always compelled to face the chance of\r\nfailure. Commodore Vanderbilt, though he often had the Street in the\r\npalm of his hand, was frequently driven into a corner where he had to do\r\nbattle for his life; and so it was with every great speculator, or\r\ncombination of speculators, until the men who control the Standard Oil\r\ntook hold. With them, manipulation has ceased to be speculation. Their\r\nresources are so vast that they need only to concentrate on any given\r\nproperty in order to do with it what they please; and that they have\r\nthus concentrated on a considerable number of properties outside of the\r\nstocks in which they are popularly supposed to be exclusively interested\r\nis a fact well known to everyone who has opportunities of getting\r\nbeneath the surface. They are the greatest operators the world has ever\r\nseen, and the beauty of their method is the quietness and lack of\r\nostentation with which they carry it on. There are no gallery plays,\r\nthere are no scare heads in the newspapers, there is no wild scramble or\r\nexcitement. With them the process is gradual, thorough, and steady, with\r\nnever a waver or break. How much money this group of men have made it is\r\nimpossible even to estimate. That it is a sum beside which the gain of\r\nthe most daring speculator of the past was a mere bagatelle is putting\r\nthe case mildly. And there is an utter absence of chance that is\r\nterrible to contemplate. This combination controls Wall Street almost\r\nabsolutely. Many of the strongest financial institutions are at their\r\nservice in supplying accommodations when needed. With such power and\r\nfacilities it is easily conceivable that these men must make enormous\r\nsums on either side of the market. So far, fortunately, their\r\nmanipulations have all been one way—upward; and in conjunction with the\r\ngeneral prosperity this has resulted in making large sums of money for\r\nnearly everybody in the Street.\r\n\r\nHere and there we have heard of losses, some of them fairly large, but\r\nin comparison with the general money-making these are hardly to be taken\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\nThe last preceding boom that Wall Street had enjoyed was as different\r\nfrom this as it is possible to imagine. It had all the elements which\r\nthis one had not. It centered about one man who stood out in the lime\r\nlight clear and distinct. It kept the Stock Exchange in a constant state\r\nof ferment. It filled the newspapers with column upon column of\r\nsensational stories. It made millions for an army of retainers, on\r\npaper, and it kept the market jerking up and down for months.\r\n\r\nRoswell P. Flower, ex-Governor of the State of New York, was the leader\r\nof the boom, and a more picturesque figure had never been seen in Wall\r\nStreet, which is saying a great deal. Mr. Flower was an individual of a\r\nvery plain exterior. He often used language that was noticeable more for\r\nits force, directness, and emphasis than it was for polish. He was\r\nrarely seen without a huge quid of tobacco that almost filled the left\r\nside of his mouth. Spittoons were an essential part of the furnishings\r\nof his office. His clothing hung on his person not unlike meal sacks.\r\nHis hat was rarely brushed, and for days at a time, apparently, he\r\nforgot to shave. Altogether he was the last person, in appearance, who\r\nwould be expected to lead in a district that is famous for its\r\nwell-groomed men. His education was certainly not collegiate. All these\r\nfactors the ordinary man would have judged to be handicaps, yet they\r\nwere Mr. Flower’s strongest aids. The lack of artificial polish gave\r\npeople confidence in his statements. His limited education enabled him\r\nto think clearly along certain lines without being hampered by mental\r\ndigressions, which would probably have come with a higher mental\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nAs the administrator and manager of the estate of his brother-in-law,\r\nHenry Keep, he came into the Street about twenty-five years ago. He\r\ncontrolled a large amount of funds, which by conservative direction he\r\nincreased very substantially. He scarcely ever figured in the\r\nspeculative field to any great extent until after he had completed his\r\nterm as Governor of New York State. When he returned to the Street from\r\nAlbany he naturally came with a considerable prestige. Ex-Governors of\r\nthe Empire State are not very plentiful in and about the Stock Exchange.\r\nHe also brought with him a large political following. In both of the\r\ngreat parties in New York State there are many men of standing and\r\ninfluence who like to take a flyer in Wall Street. Almost to a man they\r\nassociated themselves with Mr. Flower, who, during his term at the\r\ncapital, had made hosts of friends with Republicans and Democrats alike.\r\nHe also had close associations with most of the big capitalists.\r\n\r\nAfter he had settled down to business, on leaving politics behind, Mr.\r\nFlower picked out several stocks as his specialties. Under his\r\nmanipulation all these properties went up and soon began to show a big\r\nadvance, unusual strength, and great activity. The bears made frequent\r\nassaults on his position and now and then pushed him toward the wall,\r\nbut he always fought his way to the front again, and came out master in\r\nevery encounter. When he had himself pretty well intrenched in the\r\nspecialties he was handling, he suddenly plunged into Brooklyn Rapid\r\nTransit, and for months he kept things stirred up in a way that even\r\nWall Street has seldom seen. He picked up the stock commencing at 6 and\r\nin an incredibly short time ran it up to over 138. Almost every\r\npolitician in the State made a fortune on paper. Mr. Flower was\r\nimmensely popular with the Wall Street news reporters, who helped his\r\nboom along through the glowing accounts they wrote from day to day.\r\n\r\nUnder the impetus of the swirl in Rapid Transit, practically every\r\nproperty in the Street went flying upward, until the end did not seem to\r\nbe in sight. The bears were beaten to a standstill every time they\r\nshowed their heads. The only result of their attacks was that Flower\r\nstocks would jump up a notch higher. The ex-Governor preached\r\nAmericanism and confidence, until everybody believed that if a stock\r\nwere only grounded, and the property located in America, you could buy\r\nit at any price and still be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThat a terrible panic did not grow out of this boom was due only to one\r\nfact: Mr. Flower’s sudden death. Had he lived thirty days longer the\r\nbubble must have been pricked, and the result would have been\r\ndisastrous. Mr. Flower went to the country for a day’s rest, ate freely\r\nof ham and radishes, and washed his frugal meal down with a copious\r\nsupply of ice water. He died, a few hours afterwards, of an attack of\r\nacute indigestion. His death alone saved the Street.\r\n\r\nThe Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts, and his other wealthy friends rushed\r\ninto the market with millions and sustained values. They were in a\r\nposition to attribute the threatened reaction to his death, and pointed\r\nout the absurdity of letting such an incident affect the value of\r\nstocks. They discounted the break that must have come, in the natural\r\ncourse of events, under the forcing process that was going on. Reasoning\r\nsuch as this, spread broadcast through the papers, stopped the break.\r\nWhere the bottom would have fallen out entirely there was virtually but\r\na moderate break all along the line. The small speculators, operating on\r\nmoderate margins, were of course wiped out almost to a man; but most of\r\nthe big fellows were saved. It is probably the only instance on record\r\nwhere the death of a big operator saved a general smash. Those hurt were\r\nnumerous politicians and small-fry operators who, instead of getting\r\naway with snug fortunes in the shape of profits, lost everything.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident of the Flower boom was the way it was\r\ninvoluntarily helped along by young Joe Leiter. Leiter himself, although\r\nhe had gone to the wall some time previously, had indirectly brought\r\nabout certain conditions that served Mr. Flower’s purpose admirably.\r\nThese conditions were the general release of hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars on mortgages on farm lands. When Leiter began to corner wheat it\r\nwas ruling down in the neighborhood of sixty cents a bushel. He lifted\r\nit to considerably over a dollar before he went broke. This enabled\r\nthousands of farmers to realize on their crops at the dollar figure and\r\nabove, which brought prosperity almost overnight to the wheat-growing\r\nbelt. With the money realized from their wheat they paid off their\r\nmortgages to the extent of two or three hundred million dollars. These\r\nmortgages were generally held in the East. This released that much\r\nEastern capital, causing a vast volume of money to seek investment. The\r\nmen controlling this money were overjoyed when Mr. Flower made an\r\nopening for them through the Wall Street boom, and hence it was\r\ncomparatively easy, for a time, to push up values.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Pierpont Morgan, now a noted character in the Street, was trained\r\nas a clerk in the one-time famous banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Co.\r\nLater he made a connection with Anthony J. Drexel, probably the\r\nwealthiest banker of his time in America. Out of this connection grew\r\nthe house of Drexel, Morgan & Co., with Mr. Morgan as the managing\r\npartner in New York. When Mr. Drexel died, Mr. Morgan absorbed the\r\nentire business, and a few years later, when his father died, he became\r\nthe head of the London house of J. S. Morgan & Co. as well.\r\n\r\nThis put him in a very prominent position. He soon thereafter\r\ndemonstrated his influence by reorganizing the bankrupt Richmond and\r\nWest Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company, changing its name to\r\nthe Southern Railway Company. A number of small roads were added to it,\r\nmany of which were in financial straits and practically all of which had\r\nbeen badly managed. He combined them into one system under one head. Mr.\r\nMorgan next turned his attention to the reorganization of the Reading\r\nand the Erie roads, which were in a bad way. He soon produced order out\r\nof chaos there, and that resulted in a boom in railroad stocks all along\r\nthe line. He had several sharp tussles, however, with some of the big\r\nstockholders, who tried to stand out against him because they thought\r\nhis plans too drastic.\r\n\r\nThe people who followed Mr. Morgan’s lead in these transactions\r\ngenerally made money.\r\n\r\nA different sort of deal was engineered a few years before by Mr. S. V.\r\nWhite, popularly known as Deacon White, because of his position as a\r\ndeacon in Plymouth Church. Mr. White is one of the oldest operators in\r\nthe Street, and one of its most striking figures. He has made half a\r\ndozen great fortunes in speculation and lost them, but he is as\r\nundaunted as ever, and in spite of the fact that he is now over seventy\r\nyears old he is still active daily in the market.\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most unique stock deals ever carried out in the\r\nStreet resulted from the transaction of Joseph Bannigan when President\r\nof the Rubber Trust. The history of this deal, which for a time resulted\r\nin a great boom in industrials, has never been told, and is known to but\r\nvery few persons, most of whom, by the way, were its victims.\r\n\r\nBannigan was an uneducated Irishman. He began life in a New England\r\nrubber factory and conscientiously worked his way up from a wage of\r\n$1.50 a day to die worth $5,000,000. He was shrewd and bright and knew\r\nthe value of money. He saved to such good purpose that when the Rubber\r\nTrust was formed he was at the head of one of the biggest factories in\r\nthe country, located in Providence. His knowledge of the trade was so\r\nthorough that, despite the fact that he almost invariably used small\r\n“i’s” in writing a letter, he was made president of the trust, his\r\nholdings amounting to about 40,000 shares. When matters had been moving\r\nalong for some time, Bannigan made up his mind that the other men in the\r\ntrust, the big fellows, were not treating him right, and that the best\r\nthing he could do was to get out. So he packed his stock certificates in\r\na gripsack, left Providence on the night boat, landed in New York bright\r\nand early, had his breakfast, and then made a bee line for a\r\nstockbroker’s office. He had assured himself in advance that this\r\nstockbroker was to be relied upon, and so he told him frankly what he\r\nintended to do.\r\n\r\n“I want to sell out, bag and baggage,” he said. “I want to get rid of\r\nevery one of my 40,000 shares. Here they are; put them on the market and\r\nsell them.” The stockbroker told him that that would never do. If he\r\nwanted to realize full value for his holdings he would have to go about\r\nit in a different way, for if he should throw his 40,000 shares into the\r\nmarket it would knock the bottom out of prices, and he would get little\r\nor nothing for his stock. Mr. Bannigan saw the point and asked what he\r\nought to do.\r\n\r\n“Buy,” said the broker.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to buy; I have got more now than I want.”\r\n\r\n“That is all right; buy anyway; that will make a market for the stock,\r\nand you can unload when the time comes.”\r\n\r\n“How much must I buy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, about $250,000 worth.”\r\n\r\n“But I have not got $250,000 in cash to go and buy rubber stock.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can borrow it; a man in your position, Mr. Bannigan, will\r\nhave no difficulty in borrowing $250,000.”\r\n\r\nMuch against his will the old man was finally persuaded to do as he was\r\ntold. About two weeks later the broker wrote to him that he must buy\r\nsome more—this time $200,000 worth. Mr. Bannigan used rather strong\r\nlanguage, but finally yielded as before. He borrowed $200,000 and turned\r\nit over. With this additional capital to work on, the broker continued\r\nto manipulate the market. The insiders soon discovered that some strong\r\nparty was buying, but they did not know who, Bannigan having carefully\r\nkept himself in the background. His broker operated skillfully in the\r\nstock, one day buying, the next selling, to keep the stock active. The\r\nbroker after a while began to borrow large amounts of the stock. This\r\nconvinced the insiders that there was a big short interest somewhere,\r\nand they got together in order to squeeze the shorts. The inside holders\r\nwho controlled most of the stock combined to squeeze “the shorts” out.\r\nIn furtherance of this plan they put the price up to 61, and at about\r\nthat figure Bannigan’s stock was all unloaded. Bannigan now found\r\nhimself full of money, while the other fellows were filled up with his\r\nstock. They never awakened to the fact that the president had sold out\r\non them until his shares were delivered against their purchases, as they\r\nthought, of “short” stock. Rubber broke and did not stop tumbling until\r\nit had gone from 61 to 16.\r\n\r\nThis deal had all the elements of a comedy-drama, and the playwright who\r\ncan do it justice will find material there which will make him an\r\neverlasting fortune and reputation.\r\n\r\nIt is not often, however, that newcomers in the Street fare as well as\r\nthis in the end. For a time they will go on merrily enough, and send\r\nthings booming, but in the end most of them get the worst of it. At the\r\nrisk of repeating myself, I will say here:\r\n\r\nMr. A. B. Stockwell is a good illustration of the truth of this. At one\r\ntime he was worth many millions of dollars. His start in life was as a\r\npurser on a Lake Erie steamboat; his father, it is said, kept a livery\r\nstable in Cleveland. On one of his trips Stockwell was in a position to\r\nshow considerable attention to Elias Howe, the inventor of the eye at\r\nthe top end of the sewing-machine needle. Mr. Howe was accompanied by\r\nhis daughter. Stockwell made himself agreeable to Miss Howe also, and\r\nwith such good effect that he managed to win her affections, and soon\r\nthereafter married her.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Howe died, Mrs. Stockwell came into possession of her father’s\r\nmillions. With this nest egg Stockwell started in Wall Street, and\r\nbefore anyone realized what had happened he was the most talked-of man\r\nin the district. He put all his wife’s millions in Pacific Mail stock,\r\nsecured entire control of the company and elected himself its president.\r\nHe came into the Street as plain Stockwell. Then, as the news of his\r\nliberality and good-fellowship spread, he became Mr. Stockwell. After he\r\ngot hold of the Pacific Mail he was Commodore Stockwell by common\r\nconsent. Everybody bowed and scraped to him, and no man was so high and\r\nmighty that he was not proud to shake his hand.\r\n\r\nStockwell took hold of Pacific Mail at about 40 and sent it up to 107.\r\nIt was at this period that he was worth on paper over $15,000,000. But\r\nhe found, unfortunately, when it was too late to retreat, that though\r\nPacific Mail was up to 107 it was not worth that figure when the\r\nunloading commenced.\r\n\r\nHe was landed high and dry with it all, and the Street told him he was\r\nwelcome to it. He tried to sell, and found that there was no market.\r\nThen came violent demands on him to pay up his numerous call loans, and\r\nin order to respond he had to sell regardless of price, and thus a\r\nwhirlpool was created which finally sent the stock down to the price at\r\nwhich he had begun his original purchases. In this one upset he lost all\r\nhis paper profits and his wife’s millions besides. That was the most\r\nfamous boom in the history of Pacific Mail, notwithstanding Leonard\r\nJerome’s previous brilliant ups and downs in that property.\r\n\r\nLeonard Jerome and his brother Addison had a good time with Pacific Mail\r\nfor a while. They ran it up to high figures several times, but finally\r\nmet with the same experience that Stockwell did. The two Jeromes, from\r\nbeing among the wealthiest and most dazzling operators in the Street,\r\nwere in the end practically wiped out. Leonard Jerome, who was the\r\nfather of Lady Randolph Churchill, had nothing left to bequeath his\r\ndaughter except an equity in the house now occupied by the Manhattan\r\nClub on Madison Avenue, which yields an income of about $15,000 a year,\r\nof which Lady Churchill gets $10,000.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the booms that have stirred up things in Wall Street\r\nat one time or another, as did the Keene, the Gould, and the Vanderbilt\r\nbooms, and the rest I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\n  WALL STREET’S WILD SPECULATION, 1900-1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nMCKINLEY’S REËLECTION AND THE DEFEAT OF BRYANISM SET THE BIG BALL OF\r\n    SPECULATION ROLLING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE.—THE TREMENDOUS VOLUME OF\r\n    SPECULATION BY BOTH LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALISTS.—THE RUSH TO\r\n    INCORPORATE NEW COMPANIES AND CREATE INDUSTRIAL TRUSTS AND RAILWAY\r\n    COMBINATIONS.—THE ENORMOUS CAPITALIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES STEEL\r\n    CORPORATION AND OTHER COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF REAL VALUES.—THE RAPID\r\n    GROWTH AND POPULARITY OF NEW AND OLD TRUST COMPANIES AND THE EFFECT\r\n    OF THEIR COMPETITION IN FORCING BANK CONSOLIDATIONS.—THE BOLD AND\r\n    RECKLESS SPECULATIONS IN RAILWAY STOCKS OF THE NEWLY ENRICHED\r\n    WESTERN CAPITALISTS.—THE GREAT NORTHERN PACIFIC PANIC OF MAY 9,\r\n    1901.—THE CAPTURE OF CONTROL OF THE LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILWAY\r\n    BY JOHN W.

SULLY WHEN HE FAILED.—THE SUDDEN FALL\r\n    IN THE IRON BAROMETER IN 1903, AND THE GENERAL SITUATION IN 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nWall Street changed with almost magical suddenness from depression and\r\napprehension to confidence and buoyancy with the defeat of Bryan and his\r\nsilver heresy, and the reëlection of McKinley in November, 1900. Large\r\ncapitalists all over the country began to buy stocks and bonds on so\r\nheavy a scale that prices shot up rapidly, like the celebrated\r\nGilderoy’s kite, and very soon orders poured into the Stock Exchange\r\nfrom people of smaller means everywhere, and a tremendous bull market\r\nfor stocks resulted, with too many men staking, or ready to stake, their\r\nbottom dollar on the rise.\r\n\r\nThe speculative capitalists and large operators of Wall Street, not of\r\ncourse excepting many of the active Standard Oil magnates and James R.\r\nKeene, naturally availed themselves of this state of affairs to\r\nmanipulate stocks on a grand scale. Having loaded up with them early at\r\nlow prices, they boomed them with vigor; and we witnessed the beginning\r\nof a carnival of speculation, and an unexampled rush to form\r\ncombinations of industrial and railroad interests, or trusts, and\r\ngenerally to capitalize the concerns taken in for many times the amount\r\nof their previous capital or real value. The stock thus created, after\r\nbeing admitted to dealings in Wall Street, was made active and bid up by\r\nthe promoters to high figures to catch buyers, while the public, which\r\nhad become crazy to buy, took it in enormous amounts. It bought in haste\r\nto repent at leisure, for, I regret to say, most of the buyers have it\r\nstill; and the aggregate loss its shrinkage in price represents is to be\r\ncounted by very many hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nBut it was fortunate for both Wall Street and the nation that the\r\ninflation which ran riot till September, 1902, was then checked by the\r\nconservative action and warnings of the banks and men like myself, for\r\nif it had been allowed to continue for another half year it would have\r\nended in a disastrous convulsion, a bursting of the bubble, which would\r\nhave been felt all over the United States, and in every department of\r\nbusiness, as in and after the panics of 1857 and 1873. I was one of the\r\nfirst to sound the alarm and call a halt in this dangerously wild\r\nspeculation in my weekly letter dated September 13, 1902, in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n    “A man becomes an inebriate by getting himself into a condition\r\n    where he ceases to recognize effect as following cause. Under\r\n    the influence, at times, of the intoxicating beverage he will\r\n    defy both law and order. This is due to the callous condition he\r\n    has allowed himself to get into. The stock market of late has\r\n    been productive of a similar condition of mind with a majority\r\n    of people. They have been engaged now for such a prolonged\r\n    period in buying, buying, buying, making profits on all their\r\n    ventures, as to make them like the inebriate, callous to all\r\n    adverse factors whenever they come up. High prices don’t\r\n    frighten them; scarcity and high rates for money don’t frighten\r\n    them; cautionary signals don’t frighten them; strikes don’t\r\n    frighten them. Buying and holding on have simply become chronic\r\n    with them. This may not unlikely continue to be the condition of\r\n    the stock market until compulsory liquidation sets in, which the\r\n    strain in the money situation will sooner or later produce. I\r\n    recommend great caution on the buying side, and, better still,\r\n    not buying at all at the prevailing high prices. I see no\r\n    possibility of relief to the money market excepting through the\r\n    importation of gold. The activity of business all over the\r\n    country, together with the moving of the crops, is going to keep\r\n    money thoroughly employed at high rates from now onward and all\r\n    the way through the new year; therefore, those who buy stocks to\r\n    carry hereafter, excepting on big concessions from present\r\n    prices, may meanwhile be overtaken with discomfort from\r\n    depreciation in values as well as from the difficulty of\r\n    obtaining money at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\n                                                      “HENRY CLEWS.”\r\n\r\nThe intoxication of the time having gradually given place to sobriety,\r\nand a slow but heavy downward reaction in prices, we escaped the violent\r\nand widespread panic that threatened us, and that would have been\r\ninevitable had we not “slowed down” in time. As it was, the decline was\r\nlong-continued and severe, and impoverished or ruined hundreds of\r\nthousands of people, including a vast number of formerly very rich men.\r\nBoth big and little speculators became the victims of the downward\r\nplunge of prices: but the country as a whole was saved from serious\r\ndisturbance and depression—that is, from the effects of such a\r\ntremendous collapse and crash as menaced Wall Street during nearly the\r\nentire year 1903. This was very fortunate for all our material\r\ninterests; and the conservative element in Wall Street is to be\r\ncongratulated on having so successfully put on the brakes in time to\r\nprevent a collapse that would have involved and disturbed the nation\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe year 1901 was the most remarkable in the financial history of the\r\nUnited States, and Wall Street was a theater of action whose\r\nperformances astonished not only the entire country, but the world.\r\nTheir like had never been seen before, not even during the great war\r\nbetween North and South. It would take volumes to fully describe and\r\ngive retrospective clearness to the leading events of that extraordinary\r\nperiod which made the Stock Exchange continually the scene of wild\r\nexcitement, daring manipulation, and unexampled inflation.\r\n\r\nTo say that Wall Street astonished the natives and made conservative\r\nbusiness men stand aghast is no exaggeration. There were six influential\r\nfactors actively at work in that year, namely, the consolidation of\r\nrailroad and industrial companies at enormously inflated prices,\r\nincluding the disastrous Northern Pacific skyrocket “corner,” the\r\nrestless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American\r\npeople into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance, the\r\ntransformation of this country from a heavy lender in Europe to a heavy\r\nand urgent borrower, the partial failure of the corn crop, the decline\r\nin prices for nearly all the staples except grain and iron, and the\r\ncollapse in earnings and dividends of many new industrial combinations.\r\nThese included The Amalgamated Copper Company, and the panicky decline\r\nin its stock, which impoverished or ruined many thousands of investors,\r\nit being first run up to 130 and then rapidly down to 60 by the\r\nmanipulators, who sold out and then sold “short,” and who are said to\r\nhave made more than fifty millions by the up and down movement.\r\nSubsequently even this low price was cut nearly in two, as the decline\r\ndid not stop until 32½ was reached.\r\n\r\nA mere recital of events as they occurred would be an eloquent serial\r\nstory to those familiar with the alphabet of Wall Street; and there is\r\nno more interesting or exciting serial story than the stock ticker\r\ntells, from day to day, to those interested in the stock market, or one\r\nthat often excites more joy or sorrow, or carries with it more weal or\r\nwoe, prosperity or ruin. But the ticker, like Tennyson’s brook, will go\r\non forever during business hours, for we shall never be without a stock\r\nmarket and speculation.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the New York Stock Exchange in 1901 were so\r\ntremendous in volume as to excite wonder. But they only represented the\r\nspeculative spirit, the intoxication of the time. The sales in the first\r\nhalf of the year aggregated 175,800,600 shares of stocks and\r\n$637,100,800 of bonds at par value, an increase of 109,906,300 shares\r\nand $346,900,700 in bonds over the same six months in 1900.\r\n\r\nAs prices soared the volume of speculation increased, and on January 7th\r\nthe day’s total sales amounted to 2,116,500 shares, and then went on\r\nincreasing till they reached 3,271,000 on April 30th. Then came the\r\nNorthern Pacific bombshell, the panic of May 9th, when stocks came down\r\neven faster than Captain Scott’s coon, and the actual sales were still\r\nlarger, but owing to the intense excitement, demoralization, and\r\nconfusion that prevailed, it was impossible to keep track of them all,\r\nand the ticker registered only 3,073,300 shares.\r\n\r\nThis sudden catastrophe convulsed the stock market in a way that alarmed\r\nmoney lenders, destroyed confidence, and caused a general rush to sell\r\nstocks which brought them down with a crash, involving many thousands in\r\nruinous losses. The revulsion of feeling, the change in the sentiment of\r\nthe Street was as startling as a violent earthquake, and the\r\nconsequences were fraught with grave disaster. Up to the very eve of\r\nthis great convulsion in the stock market the dance of speculation had\r\nbeen fast and furious, among both “the big men” and the little, and its\r\nunlooked-for occurrence reminded one of Byron’s lines on the Brussels\r\nball, given on the eve of the battle of Waterloo, when the sound of\r\ncannon unexpectedly boomed above the music:\r\n\r\n       “On with the dance! Let joy be unconfined;\r\n        No sleep till morn when Youth and Pleasure meet\r\n        To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.\r\n        The lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men;\r\n        A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r\n        Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r\n        Soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again,\r\n        And all went merry as a marriage bell;\r\n        But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell,\r\n        Arm! arm! it is—it is—the cannon’s opening roar!”\r\n\r\nFortunately, in the midst of the Northern Pacific panic, the financial\r\nbelligerents combined to stop it. Their competitive buying for control\r\nof the stock had caused the “corner.” But the extraordinarily high\r\nprices to which it was bid up by those short of it were reached after\r\nthe competitive buying had ceased for the want of sellers. The\r\ncontestants saw the wisdom of coming to terms to restore confidence and\r\ncheck the havoc that was being wrought on the Stock Exchange, where\r\nprices had fallen from fifteen to fifty per cent. that day, while\r\nNorthern Pacific common stock had sold up to $1,000 a share. So J. P.\r\nMorgan & Co., the bankers of the Hill-Burlington-Great Northern party,\r\nand Kuhn, Loeb & Co., the bankers of the Harriman-Union Pacific party,\r\nmet in haste, and came to an agreement as to the Northern Pacific stock\r\nthey had bought, the formal announcement of which caused a violent\r\nrecovery of prices the next day, but not before the sweep of the besom\r\nof destruction had caused several Stock Exchange failures to be\r\nannounced. The recovery was followed by a relapse of equal violence\r\nunder a fresh rush to sell, which carried stocks nearly as low as in the\r\npanic, and then by a fresh recovery, a usual feature in a crisis where\r\ncredit has been severely shaken and many have been crippled.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this agreement between the two sides was the formation of\r\nthe Northern Securities Company, practically as arranged for by J. P.\r\nMorgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Mr. Morgan naming the directors by\r\nmutual consent. Into this repository, or holding company, the Hill and\r\nHarriman companies—that is, both sides to the controversy—put their\r\nNorthern Pacific stock, as well as Great Northern stock, and the\r\nNorthern Securities Company later issued its own stock to them in\r\nexchange for it.\r\n\r\nBut when, in 1904, the Northern Securities Company was held by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court to be a violation of the anti-trust law, and\r\nit became necessary to distribute its assets, a new controversy arose.\r\nIts directors proposed to make an equal, or _pro rata_, distribution of\r\nthe Northern Pacific and Great Northern stocks deposited with it,\r\nwhereas President E. H. Harriman, for the Union Pacific, which deposited\r\nthe lion’s share of the Northern Pacific, namely, $78,000,000, wanted\r\nall its stock back again; in other words, to eat his cake and have it,\r\ntoo. As this, if assented to, would have given the Union Pacific control\r\nof the Northern Pacific, President Hill, for the Great Northern\r\nBurlington system, naturally objected, and we all know of the litigation\r\nthat followed, and in view of the glorious uncertainty of the law, it\r\nwould have been rash to have predicted its final outcome.\r\n\r\nOn the Stock Exchange, April was the most active month of 1901, the\r\nsales aggregating 41,689,200, a daily average of 1,812,600. On April\r\n24th no less than 652,900 shares of Union Pacific were sold. These\r\nspecimen bricks furnish a practical commentary on the rampant\r\nspeculation then in progress.\r\n\r\nThe new incorporations of the year represented an amazing amount of\r\ncapital, the total being far in excess of any previous year, even that\r\nof 1899, when many of the large trust combinations were formed. The\r\nlargest and probably the most heavily watered combination launched was\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation, with its $508,478,000 of common\r\nstock, $510,277,300 of preferred stock, and $304,000,000 of bonds. The\r\nmania for organizing new companies and making combinations of old ones\r\non largely inflated capital spread to every State in the Union, and the\r\npromoters of industrial enterprises, in particular, seemed to be trying\r\nto surpass each other in piling Pelion on Ossa in excessive\r\ncapitalization. Their obvious purpose in most instances was to sell the\r\nstock to the public, and the poor public took the bait and suffered\r\naccordingly, for much of the stock in a great many of the new schemes\r\nbecame almost entirely worthless, both as collateral and in the stock\r\nmarket, and the rest experienced very heavy depreciation, and,\r\nfiguratively speaking, like the shaky corporations it represented, went\r\nlimping along with an uncertain gait and a ragged and down-at-the-heel\r\nappearance suggestive of reduced circumstances and hard times.\r\n\r\nIn every State there was a flood, if not a deluge, of new companies. In\r\nNew Jersey, 2,346 were formed in 1901, with a capitalization of\r\n$4,773,702,000, against 2,181 in 1900, with a capitalization of\r\n$1,350,208,400; and in New York, Ohio, and Texas the incorporation mills\r\nwere proportionately active in grinding out new companies with\r\nfictitiously large capital stocks.\r\n\r\nCommercial and manufacturing corporations were practically unknown, that\r\nis, in any substantial form, in the United States till about 1850, and\r\nthen they followed the development of the railways. In 1848 the first\r\ngeneral corporation act, known as the Manufacturing Act, had been passed\r\nin this State, and companies began to be organized under it; but the law\r\nlimited their capital and imposed other restrictions, whereas companies\r\nmay now be incorporated for a thousand years with an unlimited amount of\r\ncapital. The contrast between 1850 and this era of trusts marks the\r\ngreat and rapid progress of the country in the interval in population,\r\ncommerce, manufacturing industry, banking, railway building, and general\r\nmaterial prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe growth of trust companies has been the natural outcome of our\r\nindustrial and economic development, and the freedom allowed by our laws\r\nin monetary affairs. In England, France, and other European countries\r\nthe laws restrict corporation rights and privileges so rigidly that such\r\ncompanies would find it impossible to do business there as they do here.\r\nHence trust companies have practically no existence except in this\r\ncountry. How immensely they have prospered of recent years the banks\r\nknow to their cost. In 1882 the gross deposits of all such companies in\r\nthe United States were $144,841,000. In 1892 they were $411,659,000; but\r\nafter the new industrial combination era began, in 1897, they shot up\r\nwith amazing celerity, and new companies sprang up like mushrooms in all\r\nour large cities, and here and there in small towns.\r\n\r\nBeing competitors of the banks they shared their business, and so\r\nprevented or limited their natural growth, and forced many of the bank\r\nconsolidations that have since taken place. At the end of June, 1902,\r\ntheir deposits had mounted up to $1,525,887,000. Here was an increase of\r\n$1,114,228 in ten years to about half of the total individual national\r\nbank deposits of the country, for these on July 16, 1902, were\r\n$3,098,875,772. Moreover, in the city of New York the trust company\r\ndeposits exceed, or did exceed, the individual deposits of the national\r\nbanks, those of the latter on September 15, 1902, aggregating\r\n$603,565,374, while on June 30, 1902, the deposits of the trust\r\ncompanies, as shown by their semi-annual reports to the State\r\nSuperintendent of Banking, were $760,776,124. This comparison is a very\r\nsuggestive revelation of where the money goes and how the trust\r\ncompanies prosper at the expense of the banks.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, again, a few leading factors, or influences, controlled\r\nAmerican finance, and shaped the real financial history of the year.\r\nThese were the good corn crop, following the bad one, and other\r\nsatisfactory harvests; the overstraining of American bank resources to\r\nsupply the vast requirements of the new trust and flotation enterprises\r\nwhen the capital and currency of the country were required for its\r\nregular trade and ordinary business; the enormous increase in our\r\nforeign importations contemporaneously with a very heavy decrease in our\r\nexports; the great rise in the price of the raw materials used in our\r\nmanufactures, as well as in the cost of labor; the strenuous efforts of\r\nlarge speculative capitalists to extend and hold permanent control of\r\ntheir respective railway and industrial enterprises and undertakings;\r\nthe reckless and unprecedented Vesuvius-like eruption of speculation in\r\nrailroad and other stocks by wealthy and newly enriched Western stock\r\noperators known as “the Chicago Crowd” and “the Pittsburg Crowd,”\r\nrespectively, aided by heavy bank loans at high rates; and finally the\r\nrefusal of the public to follow them any longer as buyers. This accords\r\nwith what I have said about the influence of the conservative banks and\r\nbankers in calling a halt on the wild speculation for a rise which raged\r\nup to the latter part of September in that year.\r\n\r\nThe exploit, in 1902, of John W. Gates, backed by his speculative\r\nassociates, in buying a majority of the Louisville & Nashville Railway\r\nstock, was his last successful venture to make a big haul of millions on\r\nthe Stock Exchange. After that he and they met with very heavy losses in\r\ntheir continued efforts to boom stocks. But Mr. Gates was paid a profit\r\nof ten millions of dollars on his Louisville & Nashville purchases by J.\r\nP. Morgan & Co., a partner in that firm having made the bargain with him\r\nat the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, at three o’clock in the morning, after it\r\nhad been discovered that Mr. Gates had really bought control of the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nIt transpired, in evidence, that Mr. Perkins had gone there at that hour\r\nfor this purpose, and found Mr. Gates in bed. The object in giving him\r\nso large an amount above what he had paid for the stock he had just\r\nbought was to get him out of the way as a mischief-maker, for with him\r\nin control of the Louisville & Nashville, there was no telling what he\r\nwould do to demoralize the Southern Railway system. He was looked upon\r\nas a bull in a china shop, to be coaxed and tempted out, regardless of\r\nexpense, before he began to toss the crockery with his horns.\r\n\r\nSo when he said to Mr. Perkins, “As you want the stock so badly, to keep\r\nthe Belmont board in control and protect the Southern Railway, I will\r\nlet you have it if you will pay me ten millions more than it cost,” the\r\nproposition was promptly accepted; and the deal was closed on this\r\nbasis. The Louisville & Nashville and the Southern Railway companies\r\nwere supposed to have been jointly interested in the purchase, but the\r\nGates stock was finally turned over to the Atlantic Seaboard Air Line.\r\n\r\nBuying control of the Louisville & Nashville by Mr. Gates was a far\r\nbolder operation than President Hill’s purchase of the stock of the\r\nBurlington & Quincy for the Great Northern, or than the Moore Brothers’\r\npurchase of control of the Rock Island and their subsequent great\r\ninflation of its stock and bonded debt, because Gates bought it merely\r\nas a speculation, without any desire to manage the road. He was\r\nfortunate in being able to sell it so easily to those he had frightened\r\nby his daring coup.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the leading influences, or principal\r\nfactors, in Wall Street in 1903 with those of 1901 and 1902. Stock\r\nExchange transactions in that year were very much smaller than in 1902,\r\nbut not nearly as much so as the total in 1902 had fallen below those of\r\n1901, the year of the greatest activity and excitement in this memorable\r\nspeculative period. The sales in 1903 aggregated 161,099,800 shares,\r\nagainst 188,497,600 in 1902 and 265,945,700 in 1901. The largest total\r\non any one day in 1903 was 1,539,000, against 1,996,000 in 1902 and\r\n3,202,200 in 1901. The largest in any month in 1903 was that of January,\r\n16,002,300, against 26,568,000 in April, 1902, and the smallest in 1903\r\nwas 10,731,000 in November, against 7,884,900 in June, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe barometer of the iron trade was still rising at the opening of 1903.\r\nGood crops had been gathered and were being sold at good prices; railway\r\nearnings were large, and railway companies were making heavy\r\nexpenditures for new equipment and improvements, and every department of\r\nbusiness and manufacturing industry seemed prosperous, with the iron\r\ntrade enjoying its full share of that prosperity. So heavy, indeed, was\r\nthe demand for iron and steel that the capacity of our works was unequal\r\nto it, and we were importing iron and steel largely, as we had been in\r\n1902.\r\n\r\nBut in June the iron industry experienced one of its time-honored\r\nlightning changes. That barometer suddenly fell. The demand subsided\r\nwith surprising celerity in all lines, and by November prices in some of\r\nthese were fifty per cent. lower than in January. The boom in the iron\r\ntrade which commenced in 1899 was at an end after lasting for four\r\nyears. At the end of the year, however, the trade began to revive, and\r\n1904 witnessed a slow but steady improvement in it, as the reports of\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation’s earnings have shown. Consequently\r\nthat highly inflated company, after being forced in 1903 to suspend\r\ndividends on its common stock, was encouraged to continue them at seven\r\nper cent. on its preferred stock. But this carried cold comfort to the\r\nhundreds of thousands who had been impoverished by buying these stocks\r\nat the high prices at which they were floated here and in Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1903 liquidation on a large scale in stocks had run\r\nits course and exhausted itself, and the market quieted into comparative\r\nsteadiness; and in 1904 we had, on the whole, nothing more than a dull\r\ntrading market, with the outside public very largely absent. But there\r\nhas been a general tendency toward slow improvement, although the net\r\nearnings of both railways and industrial companies have, on the average,\r\nshown a heavy shrinkage, a reflection of the reduced volume of trade and\r\nmore or less industrial depression following the overstimulated boom of\r\nprevious years. Just as 1901 was the year of the most unbridled and\r\nunrestrained inflation, 1902 witnessed a constant battle against the\r\ntendency to a downward reaction, and 1903 saw and felt the reaction,\r\nwhich was all the more severe because it had been so long delayed.\r\n\r\nIn the cotton market, however, as wild and extraordinary a bull\r\nspeculation raged in 1903 and the early part of 1904, under the lead of\r\nDaniel J. Sully in New York, and William P. Brown and a Southern clique\r\nin New Orleans, as ever excited the Stock Exchange. Through their\r\nmanipulation, helped by the statistical position of cotton and the\r\nprospect of reduced production, cotton rose, under an enormous and\r\nunprecedented volume of transactions, from about eight cents a pound\r\nhere to seventeen cents, with frequent violent fluctuations, and Mr.\r\nSully was avowedly planning to carry it up to twenty cents, when he\r\nfound his resources insufficient to carry, on a falling market, the\r\namount of cotton sold to him. So after going up like a rocket, he came\r\ndown like the rocket stick, although his previous profits by the rapid\r\nrise had run into several millions. It was well that a halt was thus\r\npractically called to this excited speculation and excessive advance in\r\ncotton, for it had inflicted heavy losses upon spinners and caused the\r\nclosing of many mills. Sully’s failure was the logical result of a too\r\ndaring speculative campaign, and reminds us of that vaulting ambition\r\nwhich overleaps itself and falls on the other side.\r\n\r\nGlancing at other countries, I find that Canada made more material\r\nprogress in 1903 than in any previous year in her history, business\r\nincreasing substantially in nearly every branch of trade and finance,\r\nstimulated by bountiful crops and 150,000 immigrants. But in England the\r\ncontinued decline of British Consols to the lowest prices in a\r\ngeneration reflected a low financial barometer, the legacy of the costly\r\nSouth African war. France, however, made the best showing of the year in\r\nEurope in finance and general prosperity, while in Germany a vigorous\r\nindustrial revival lifted that country out of its previous depression\r\nconsequent on over-speculation and bank failures.\r\n\r\nOne question of great interest in relation to our new industrial\r\ncombinations is whether a proper readjustment of their hugely inflated\r\ncapital and excessive charges will place them permanently in a condition\r\nof efficiency, productiveness, solvency, and prosperity, or whether they\r\nwill ultimately drift, one by one, into the hands of receivers through\r\ntheir inability to make both ends meet, or become hopeless wrecks, like\r\nthe Shipbuilding Trust. The same fate is liable to overtake many other\r\nlarge flotations into which there was a too copious flow of water,\r\nsupplemented by chicanery and misrepresentation. Many of these have been\r\norganized in disregard and defiance of legitimate finance, and have\r\nexposed the stock market and all the monetary interests depending upon\r\nthem to risks and disastrous disturbances inseparable from organizations\r\nwhose foundations rest largely on wind and water and on prospectuses and\r\nbook-keeping that often failed to tell the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was well that a stop was practically put to the creation of such\r\ninflated industrial combinations, as well as to needless combinations\r\nand highly inflated stock issues among the railroads for power and\r\nprofit and stock-jobbing purposes, by the course of the Wall Street\r\nbanking interest, to which I have referred, in coming to the conclusion\r\nthat the over-watering of new companies, the marketing of new stocks,\r\nand the rise of prices on the Stock Exchange had been carried beyond the\r\npoint of safety, and that the outside public had bought more speculative\r\nindustrial and railway stocks than they would be able to carry on a\r\nfalling market.\r\n\r\nThey argued, therefore, that their buying power and their inclination to\r\nbuy were nearly exhausted, and that the stock market had become largely\r\na field of action for certain heavy and reckless speculators, each of\r\nwhom had suddenly made many millions by the formation of new trusts and\r\nrailway combinations. Some of these had become multi-millionaires\r\nthrough the early sale of the heavy amounts of United States Steel stock\r\nthey received in exchange for their plants when that huge corporation\r\nwas launched in its sea of water. In this they were like some others who\r\nenriched themselves by their industrial combinations in the West before\r\nthey branched out in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nVery large bank loans to the brokers of these big operators were\r\ngradually called in and fresh accommodations refused them. Without loans\r\nit was impossible for them to buy and run up stocks to inordinately high\r\nprices, as they had been doing. Therefore they found that, to a large\r\nextent, their occupation was, like Othello’s, gone. They were eagles\r\nwith clipped wings.\r\n\r\nThe heavy liquidation by large and small operators in 1903 caused a\r\nheavy and almost continuous decline in prices on the Stock Exchange.\r\nMany rich men were compelled by this shrinkage and the calling in of\r\ntheir loans by the banks to sell out heavy lines of both railway and\r\nindustrial stocks. Not a few of these lost practically all their\r\ncapital, while nearly all the rest sold a large part of their best\r\nholdings to protect the remainder, which became unmarketable.\r\n\r\nThis period of liquidation and depression left Wall Street and the\r\ncountry at large in 1904 thickly sprinkled with poor rich men,\r\ncapitalists with a good deal of property, real and personal, including\r\nstocks, but all unsalable in the market except at an almost ruinous\r\nloss. Their policy is naturally to hold on to what they have left till\r\nthe tide turns, and if they are strong enough to be able to do this they\r\nwill doubtless meet with their reward. History repeats itself in Wall\r\nStreet as well as elsewhere, and with this prospect in view they can\r\ncheerfully say, as the old song says, “There’s a good time coming, boys;\r\nonly wait a little longer.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, those who were active in Wall Street during this eventful\r\nperiod of inflation and speculation must note, more than others, the\r\nvast change that has come over sentiment and opinion in Wall Street and\r\neverywhere else.\r\n\r\nBoth Wall Street and the outside public have lost the faith that they\r\nhad in many of the stock-market leaders, the men who were once followed\r\nblindly in their schemes of inflation and regarded as omnipotent in\r\ntheir execution. The power and prestige of these leaders, for the\r\npresent at least, have passed entirely away, and none are so poor as to\r\ndo them reverence. The devotees of the Street no longer worship the old\r\nidols.\r\n\r\nWall Street and the public also lost faith in all new ventures and new\r\nrailway and industrial bond and stock issues, as well as in the good\r\njudgment and good faith of the promoters and corporations concerned. The\r\nrevelations of fraud, chicanery, and excessive capitalization that have\r\nbeen made in the courts and elsewhere, have undeceived even the dullest\r\nand most credulous believers in the schemes and schemers that took the\r\ncountry by storm in the days of Wall Street’s wild and pyrotechnical\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nOut of evil there cometh good, and this great change from blind\r\ncredulity and inordinate inflation to discriminating distrust and severe\r\ncontraction has exerted a wholesome effect in paving the way to a\r\nsounder, safer, and generally better state of things both in and out of\r\nWall Street. But meanwhile one bad sign is noteworthy. The large\r\ncorporations, being unable to market new bond issues, are borrowing\r\nheavily from banking syndicates at five to six per cent. on notes\r\nrunning from one to three years. There is danger in this, and the way of\r\nthe borrower on these terms may, like that of the transgressor, be hard.\r\nBut the end may justify the means; and the nation is still growing as\r\nrapidly and as grandly as ever in our history from ocean to ocean.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to provoke pessimism in the magnificent strides we are\r\nmaking in the march of progress; Wall Street is always sure to reflect\r\nthis progress and our growth in material prosperity, as well as any\r\nperiods of depression we may encounter, for it is the great barometer\r\nnot only of the country and the times, but very largely of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\n        REVIEW OF THE PANIC YEAR, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1903 passed into history with few pleasant memories. To a great\r\nnumber of individuals it was a year of disappointment and loss. To the\r\nvery few it was a year of golden experience, demonstrating anew that\r\nreal success only comes from rigid adherence to sound business\r\nprinciples and abstention from illegitimate speculation. Those who\r\nremained steadfast to well-established methods of finance and business\r\nweathered the storms of the year with little injury; while those who\r\ndefied economic laws and ventured on the untried highways to success\r\nwere, later, chiefly engaged in repairing battered fortunes and\r\ngathering together their scattered senses.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred and three was chiefly conspicuous as marking the\r\nculmination and collapse of the great trust movement which began five or\r\nsix years ago. The country had fairly gone combination mad, both capital\r\nand labor emulating each other in the furious race toward combination\r\nand monopoly. All consequences were blindly disregarded, only the\r\nadvantages of combination receiving any serious attention, and no regard\r\nwhatever was paid to the workings of these huge combinations. Whoever\r\npointed out their inherent defects, their defiance of natural economic\r\nlaws, their ineradicable opposition to human nature, their socialistic\r\ntendencies, their opposition to individuality, their inability to\r\nsuppress competition—whoever was bold enough to oppose these tendencies\r\non such grounds was swept aside with contempt and indifference. This\r\nphase of the movement, however, was by no means the end of the trust\r\nmania. It received an enormous stimulus from Wall Street, where the\r\nclever promoter quickly discovered in the increased profits and power of\r\nthese combines something new to capitalize. These forced profits,\r\ntogether with the premiums paid to original owners for control of good\r\nwill and for promoters’ commissions, were the basis of an enormous\r\novercapitalization, the new concerns frequently being capitalized at\r\nseveral times their real value. Not less than $6,000,000,000 of these\r\nnew creations was made within a few short years, forming the basis of a\r\ncolossal speculation, backed by unequaled financial power and launched\r\nupon an unprecedented industrial boom. It is not the purpose of this\r\nbrief review to cite instances of failure. Fortunately, the losses\r\nresulting from inability to unload on the public fell chiefly upon those\r\nbest able to bear them, the panic being strictly financial and,\r\nfortunately, not commercial or industrial. For the original shareholders\r\nin these combinations who failed to sell, the losses were chiefly on\r\npaper; but they were sufficiently heavy to seriously cripple many rich\r\nmen whose fortunes had been locked up in these enormously inflated new\r\ncreations. Syndicate after syndicate was formed to finance these\r\norganizations; some made fabulous profits, but others were closed out\r\nwith heavy losses, bringing the country to the verge of the greatest\r\npanic in history. Fortunately, the country’s general prosperity was only\r\nslightly impaired by the tremendous strain thus imposed on Wall Street.\r\nThe storm was finally safely weathered because of the prudence of our\r\nbankers and the strength of our national resources, as well as the\r\ncontinued prosperity of the farmer, who once more proved himself the\r\nbackbone of the nation. These experiences have effectually killed the\r\ntrust mania, and its revival is exceedingly improbable. Big\r\ncorporations, it is true, will remain, for the reason that they are the\r\nbest known means of doing the world’s work; but the era of excessive\r\ncapitalization of good will, promoters’ fees, monopoly profits, and the\r\ndelusions of visionary economists is happily at an end. Whether the\r\nfinal days of reckoning for the trusts have been seen or not is a\r\nquestion that must be left until the ultimate test of business adversity\r\nis applied, which we sincerely hope is still far distant. At best, the\r\nfuture of the industrials is dubious. Along with, and as a natural\r\nsequence of, the trust movement came the labor movement. The power of\r\ncombination once discovered was as badly misused by labor as by capital;\r\neven worse, for the demands of labor were pushed to such extremes of\r\nextortion and injustice as to throttle business and arouse popular\r\nindignation among those who still preserved some ideas of individual\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nNext to the trust movement the most potent influence in the business\r\nworld was the simply phenomenal boom in the iron and steel trade. The\r\nworld had never seen such rapid development before. This was based\r\nprincipally upon the enormous demands of American railroads, which have\r\nbeen practically reconstructed in order to meet the tremendous rush of\r\ntraffic which the nation’s growth has imposed upon them. The big car and\r\nthe big locomotive necessitated heavier rails, new bridges, and new\r\nterminal facilities; so that hundreds and hundreds of millions were thus\r\nexpended, very largely out of current earnings, but in many cases, also,\r\nby the creation of new capital issues. It is probable that the heaviest\r\nportion of this work has been done, yet much remains to be completed,\r\nand railroads will be heavy buyers of steel to continue projected\r\nimprovements. Another powerful stimulus to the iron trade was the use of\r\nthe steel frame building for office purposes. This meant a revolution in\r\noffice buildings, and the business centers of all our large cities are\r\nundergoing a process of reconstruction which is far from complete, and\r\nwas brought to an abrupt halt by the extortionate demands of labor. In\r\naddition to these two great sources of demand the uses of iron and steel\r\nare steadily extending with the progress of invention, the cheapening of\r\ntheir cost, and the high price of lumber. The iron trade’s pace was too\r\nrapid to last, and the reaction came with unexpected severity in the\r\nlatter half of 1903, precipitated, of course, by the financial reaction,\r\nwhich, along with the labor agitation, discouraged all new enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\n     LEADING WALL STREET EVENTS UP TO THE FALL OF\r\n                              1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural result of the panic of 1903, and the long period of\r\ndepression in Wall Street, was that an unprecedentedly large surplus\r\nreserve was accumulated by the New York banks in 1904, reaching its\r\nmaximum in August. This was still further swelled in 1905, when\r\nspeculation for a rise again assumed formidable proportions, and new\r\nhigh records were made in the stock market. Both bank loans and deposits\r\nreached a magnitude never before known, and the activity on the Stock\r\nExchange, combined with that in trade, and land, mining, and other\r\nspeculations outside of Wall Street, caused the clearing house exchanges\r\nto greatly exceed those of any previous year.\r\n\r\nOur foreign imports also increased till they made new high records,\r\nalthough our exports failed to keep pace with them. This large import\r\ntrade reflected both the rising fortunes of the rich, who had suffered\r\nseverely during the depression of 1903, and the general prosperity. Our\r\nimports are the barometer of the times. When these are good, they are\r\nlarge; but in bad times they shrink enormously, for a large percentage\r\nof them represent luxuries, and we are a luxury-loving people, and, in\r\ncomparison with Europeans, our manner of living is expensive, not to say\r\nextravagant.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1905 the banks of the rest of the country followed\r\nthose of New York in reporting deposits and loans larger than ever\r\nbefore, whereas in the early part of it their only high record was in\r\nthe amount of their cash reserves. This showed the great demand for\r\nloans and discounts to meet the requirements of the rapidly increasing\r\nvolume of trade and speculation.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money available for loans was largely reduced in the early\r\npart of 1905 by our heavy exports of gold. But it was subsequently\r\nincreased by the issue, up to December 1st, of sixty millions in\r\nNational Bank note circulation, which was so much fuel added to the fire\r\nof speculation, not, however, in Wall Street, as much as in the\r\ninterior, where there was a rage for new enterprises of all kinds,\r\nmostly speculative. Everyone with money enough to make a venture seemed\r\nto be seeking a short cut to wealth.\r\n\r\nThis inland speculation and business activity, particularly in the West\r\nand South, caused the exchanges or clearings of the banks all over the\r\ncountry, except in New York, which was comparatively dull, to reach\r\nlarger totals than ever before. Our iron production and foreign imports,\r\nat the same time, made new high records.\r\n\r\nThe gold in the United States Treasury, owned by the Government,\r\nincreased under the tariff on imports from $193,072,614, early in 1905,\r\nto $291,258,135, near the end, and the total amount held by it,\r\nincluding that held against outstanding gold certificates, increased to\r\n$816,354,352, the largest in the Government’s history, and also the\r\nlargest held by any government or institution in the world. The next\r\nlargest sum ever held elsewhere was $591,600,000, by the Bank of Russia,\r\nin 1898. Yet on January 31, 1895, the total amount of gold held by Uncle\r\nSam—that is, by the Treasury—was only $97,353,776, and on February 12th\r\nthis had dwindled to $41,340,181, owing to the run on the Treasury\r\nthrough fear that the Government might be forced to suspend gold\r\npayments. But President Cleveland’s prompt action in selling bonds for\r\ngold—to the Morgan-Belmont syndicate—averted this possibility.\r\n\r\nBefore glancing at more recent events, it is well to refresh our\r\nmemories by looking back at the most conspicuous features of the\r\nstirring period in Wall Street’s history, extending from the beginning\r\nof 1901 to 1906. In 1901 we had a year of extraordinary developments,\r\nincluding new company organizations and old company amalgamations, wild\r\nand reckless speculation by the outside public, heavy borrowing of\r\nEuropean money to carry on this speculation, the failure of the corn\r\ncrop, and, except for corn, a heavy fall in the prices of our products.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Wall Street was flooded with new bond and stock flotation\r\nschemes, all clamoring for bank loans, although the activity of trade\r\ncalled for all the loanable capital available. Coincidently, there was\r\nwild and reckless speculation in stocks by newly made industrial\r\nmillionaires with large bank resources and enormous loans at their\r\ncommand. The outside public, however, were not tempted by the bait they\r\noffered. Hence, the banks had an excessive burden of loans, all the\r\ngreater because of the determination, at any risk, of the speculative\r\ncapitalists to carry out their flotation schemes so as to control great\r\nindustrial, railway, and other corporations. Meanwhile, there was an\r\nimmense increase in our foreign imports and a decrease in our\r\nagricultural exports, and a great rise in raw materials and the cost of\r\nlabor. But, fortunately, the year gave us a good corn crop and other\r\nsatisfactory harvests.\r\n\r\nThen came 1903 with its train of disasters. Investors took alarm at the\r\nmasses of new securities thrown upon the market, and withdrew from it.\r\nThe securities consequently became unsalable, and prices declined\r\nrapidly. This forced liquidation in bonds and stocks of all kinds,\r\nparticularly the better kinds, to save the poorer from sacrifice by the\r\nsyndicates, corporations, firms, and persons who were over-extended and\r\nunable to respond to the calling in of loans by the banks and other\r\nmoney lenders. Wall Street was full of “undigested securities,” on which\r\nit was impossible to borrow any longer. So multitudes of holders had to\r\nsell them for what they would bring. Then came a heavy decline in iron\r\nand steel, among other things, an equally heavy reduction of the profits\r\nof industrial corporations, with many corresponding reductions in\r\ndividends, and a very sharp contraction in our before greatly expanded\r\nforeign imports owing to the hard times. We had a rich man’s panic, and\r\nplenty of poor rich men. But, again, we had abundant grain crops,\r\nalthough the cotton crop was very short, which resulted in our shipping\r\nmore cotton to Europe in the autumn than ever before, while its price\r\nwas abnormally high.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 we saw one effect of the depression of 1903 in the abnormally\r\nlarge surplus reserves of the New York banks, when money on call for\r\nabout eight months loaned largely as low as one per cent. Only four\r\ntimes before had these reserves been exceeded. Then came the largest\r\ngold exports ever made by us. In June the stock market began to recover\r\nunder spirited speculation for a rise, together with much buying by\r\ninvestors. But reckless professional speculators carried prices so high\r\nthat the market collapsed in December. During the year there had been a\r\nslow yet general revival of trade, in the face of extremely high prices\r\nfor cotton, resulting from a short crop and a bull movement, which\r\nparalyzed the cotton manufacture, and caused many mills to close both\r\nhere and in England. But happily this was followed by the most bountiful\r\ncotton crop we ever had, owing to the high price of the staple having\r\nstimulated cotton planting all over the South. A heavy fall in the price\r\nof cotton resulted, in which the bull leader failed. But the grain crops\r\nmet with disaster, and were the smallest since 1900, which resulted in\r\nthe highest prices since 1898, and the smallest exports to Europe since\r\n1872. The presidential campaign in the meantime passed without creating\r\na ripple in the tide of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, simultaneously with much discussion of the world’s increasing\r\ngold product, we saw both here and in the Old World, especially in the\r\nlatter part of the year, unexampled monetary stringency with very high\r\nrates for money. The surplus reserve of the New York banks was wiped out\r\ntwice, that is, they twice fell below the dead line of the required\r\ntwenty-five per cent. reserve on their deposits, while the Bank of\r\nEngland’s condition was the lowest since 1890, and the Bank of Germany’s\r\nthe lowest since 1897. Yet we had a very active and excited bull\r\nspeculation in stocks, just as Germany had, despite the high rates for\r\nmoney, and its abnormal scarcity consequent on its vast employment in\r\ntrade and speculative enterprises outside of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThat the world’s increased gold product largely stimulated speculation\r\nfor a rise, both by adding to the amount of gold in circulation and the\r\namount of paper money issued by the banks against it, is certain. Its\r\neffect has not been seen in lowering rates of interest, but in lowering\r\nits own value, or purchasing power, by reason of its increased supply\r\nor, in other words, by raising the prices of stocks, commodities, labor,\r\nand whatever else money buys. So the increased supply of gold has only\r\nquickened the uses for it by fostering speculation, and the demand for\r\nspeculation has outrun the increased supply of gold—that is, money—and\r\ncorrespondingly raised interest rates, as well as prices. In 1905 our\r\nnational prosperity was crowned with abundant harvests, the corn crop\r\nhaving been the largest on record, and that of wheat the second largest.\r\nThis gave a fresh impetus to trade and speculative enterprise, with\r\nincreased railway and industrial earnings, and production, especially in\r\niron and steel products, at a higher pitch than ever before. Dividends\r\nand reserves also increased in proportion. Russia’s disastrous war was\r\nwaged without causing any national disturbance in Wall Street, and her\r\nlargely reduced crop of wheat helped us to secure better prices for our\r\nown surplus wheat in Europe. So it is an ill wind that blows no one any\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, too, we witnessed the stormy upheaval in the Equitable Life\r\nAssurance Society, begun by the acrimonious duel between President\r\nAlexander and Vice President Hyde, which led to the general exposure of\r\nthe waste, extravagance, graft, and corruption in life-insurance\r\nmanagement, through the investigation of the New York Legislative\r\nCommittee. The loss of new insurance business, caused by the popular\r\ndistrust of the companies exposed, had its principal effect in Wall\r\nStreet in their reduced power to buy bonds; and the prolonged stagnation\r\nin the bond market after they ceased to be large buyers was largely\r\nattributable to this cause. But the exposure was much needed and did\r\ngreat good in correcting abuses of power and turning the rascals out.\r\n\r\nOur exports of domestic merchandise kept pace with our tremendous\r\nindustrial prosperity, and these more than doubled in the ten years\r\nending with June, 1906. Raw cotton, provisions, and iron and steel\r\nmanufactures were exported in the fiscal year 1906 to a value exceeding\r\n$300,000,000, iron and steel showing the largest increase, and seventeen\r\narticles, or classes of articles, had an export value of from ten to\r\nforty-two millions. While iron and steel have taken third place, raw\r\ncotton still holds the first, and provisions the second, and copper\r\nmanufactures have advanced from the eleventh to the fourth place. But\r\nrefined mineral oil, that was third, is now the eleventh, and flour has\r\ndropped from fourth to seventh, although showing an increase of seven\r\nmillions, and wheat from seventh to thirteenth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our exports of agricultural implements were five\r\ntimes as great in 1906 as in 1896, which advanced them from the\r\ntwenty-third to the fourteenth place in the list. Our cotton\r\nmanufactures, too, advanced in value from twelfth to eighth, that is,\r\nfrom $16,750,000 to $53,000,000. There is, however, still room for a\r\ngreat increase in these, and the outlook favors a large and growing\r\ndemand for them in China, the Philippines, and South America. We have\r\nbecome a great manufacturing and mining, as well as agricultural,\r\nnation, and a lower tariff on raw materials would swell our exports\r\nenormously. That will come in time; but at present politics stand in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 we saw a continuation of the same big bull speculation in stocks\r\nthat, with varying fortunes, had been progressing since June, 1904, with\r\nEdward H. Harriman, president of the Union Pacific Railway system, and\r\nJames J. Hill, president of the Great Northern Railway system, the most\r\nconspicuously dominant figures in the railway world, and, incidentally,\r\nin the world of Wall Street. Prices on the Stock Exchange, and the rates\r\nfor money, both on call and time, were abnormally high, and still\r\ntending upward, till both frequently exceeded six per cent. in August,\r\nand, in some instances, jumped as high as thirty per cent. early in\r\nSeptember, the excess above six, in the case of time loans, being\r\nrepresented by a commission. This, on the eve of the usual drain of\r\nmoney westward and southward, to move the crop, caused much anxiety for\r\nthe future, as it was entirely without precedent in that month. But the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, through bank deposits and gold imports, was\r\nrelied upon to relieve the stringency when it became more acute later\r\non, under the actual drain of money West and South. He did so by\r\nrenewing his offer, made in April, to deposit gold with national banks\r\nwhen secured by bonds, to the amount of any gold they wanted to import,\r\nthe deposits to be returned when the gold arrived. Thus they were saved\r\nloss of interest in transit, and gold was imported largely.\r\n\r\nThe money market seemed to have no terrors for the great speculative\r\ncapitalists in control of the stock market. Prices were still bid up\r\nboldly, and the Harriman and Hill stocks, in particular, were marked up\r\nto figures never before quoted, just as Reading and the other anthracite\r\ncoal stocks had been long before and have been since.\r\n\r\nThe chief sensation of the year 1906 in the stock market was produced by\r\nthe Harriman announcement on Friday, August 17th, that the semi-annual\r\ndividend on Union Pacific had been raised to five per cent., or from a\r\nsix-per-cent. per annum basis to ten per cent.; and that an initial\r\ndividend of two and a half per cent., or at the rate of five per cent.\r\nper annum, had been declared on Southern Pacific. These unexpectedly\r\nlarge dividends and the delay in making them known, after they had been\r\nacted upon by the directors on Wednesday, and finally on Thursday,\r\ngreatly excited and disturbed Wall Street. They were dividends that\r\nstaggered the bears and astonished the bulls, and caused an advance of\r\nsixteen per cent. in Union Pacific and five per cent. in Southern\r\nPacific stock that day. They also made the whole market run into a wild\r\nbull speculation, stimulated by a rush of “shorts” to cover their\r\ncontracts, and a sudden influx of fresh buyers from the outside public.\r\nReckless buying by these made it easy for the bull leaders to run prices\r\nup sharply, especially as it was expected or feared by many that the\r\nexample set by Union Pacific in dividend raising would, or at least\r\nmight, be followed by certain other large companies, both railway and\r\nindustrial, whether the increase was justified by actual net earnings,\r\nor only intended for stock-jobbing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms of President Harriman and his associates to which these\r\nsensationally large and peculiarly announced dividends gave rise, were\r\ntoo trenchant to bear quotation or description. But Mr. Harriman was\r\nsaid to have added ten millions to his personal fortune by the rise in\r\nUnion Pacific and Southern Pacific stock, which preceded and followed\r\nthese very generous distributions to the stockholders.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Mr. Harriman, the son of a quiet country clergyman, should\r\nhave been able to come into Wall Street and climb the ladder to wealth\r\nand power as he has done, and with such amazing celerity, shows the\r\nunlimited possibilities of the Street as a gold mine, for the Union\r\nPacific Railway system, like the other great railway systems whose\r\nstocks and bonds have always been dealt in here, was practically born\r\nand financed in Wall Street. His rise to a position of such prominence\r\nand vast power is far more wonderful even than the career of Russell\r\nSage as a Wall Street money maker; for Russell Sage never had any power\r\nbut his money, whereas Edward Henry Harriman represents and controls\r\nthousands of millions’ worth of other people’s property, employing tens\r\nof thousands of persons. He is a moving spirit in dozens of banks and\r\nother corporations, including the Wells Fargo Express Company, outside\r\nof the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific system of railways and\r\nsteamships. The great stock market struggle between Harriman and Hill\r\nfor the control of Northern Pacific in 1901 was a battle royal on a\r\ngrand yet disastrous scale, that will always be memorable in the history\r\nof Wall Street.\r\n\r\nWhen Russell Sage died in July, 1906, within a few days of his reaching\r\nninety years, leaving not far from a hundred millions of money, he left\r\na will which reflected his sagacity as a money saver, for he left all he\r\nhad, except a few unimportant bequests, to his wife. He did so, I infer,\r\ninstead of distributing his great wealth himself, because he knew that\r\nthe State inheritance tax would only be one per cent. on what he gave\r\nher, while it would be five per cent. on what he left to such relatives\r\nas he had surviving, as well as to all others.\r\n\r\nIt was, to a certain extent, “the ruling passion strong in death,” for,\r\nof course, he knew that his wife had no use or desire for so much money.\r\nAlthough his bequeathing it to her was a tribute to her goodness and a\r\nsymbol of their happy married life, she would probably have preferred to\r\nshoulder a much lighter load of wealth. Its distribution will be no\r\nordinary task, although it will doubtless be a labor of love with Mrs.\r\nSage.\r\n\r\nRussell Sage, in his manner of life, all now agree, set a good example\r\nof frugality and industry in an extravagant and pleasure-loving age, and\r\nhence he is held by many to have been a public benefactor. His unusually\r\neconomical and plain habits, together with his great wealth and great\r\nage, naturally made him conspicuous and also a target for the wits, and\r\nin this way he became better known through caricature than\r\nmatter-of-fact description. But that was one of the penalties of\r\npublicity. He passed from poverty to great wealth entirely of his own\r\ncreation without being spoiled by it, and remained one of the plain,\r\nunpretentious people till the end.\r\n\r\nHe owed all he had to Wall Street, and his career illustrated, more than\r\nany other has ever done, how fertile a field for fortune making Wall\r\nStreet may prove to a sagacious man, of untiring industry, who knows how\r\nto cultivate it, and can see and avail himself of its splendid\r\nopportunities. His rise from extreme poverty to immense wealth, through\r\nhis own unaided exertions, shows how one man, single-handed, may do\r\nwonders and turn all he touches to gold, and that, too, in Wall Street.\r\nWe are living in a stirring and rapidly progressive time, and the great\r\nand growing importance of the New York Stock Exchange was reflected by\r\nthe rise in the price of a membership in it in 1906 to not very far from\r\na hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe year 1906 was one of immense activity and prosperity in trade.\r\nPrices were high and still advancing, and profits large, particularly\r\nthose of industrial corporations. At the same time a mammoth bull\r\nmovement was running its course on the Stock Exchange, and the grain\r\ncrop turned out larger than ever before in our history, while enormous\r\nissues of new securities were announced by both railway and industrial\r\ncorporations. These new issues severely taxed the resources of the money\r\nmarket, already being too heavily drawn upon by the “big men” of the\r\nStreet to promote their wild bull campaign in stocks, and spasms of\r\nstringency were frequent. Indeed, the year 1906 from beginning to end\r\nwitnessed a continuation of those inordinately heavy demands for money\r\nfrom Wall Street and corporations, and these led to the disturbed\r\nmonetary conditions which were first felt in September, 1905. It was an\r\neventful year, a year of immense activity on the Stock Exchange, in\r\nwhich much that was unprecedented occurred. It was a year in which the\r\nstock market, after touching high record prices and violent ups and\r\ndowns, went gradually, in an excited speculation, from bad to worse, in\r\na limited sense, or from one critical stage to another, till it reached\r\nthe year’s end. Then it averaged only nine per cent. below the highest\r\nprices. But it became, in spite of the boldest bull manipulation,\r\ngradually weaker and more demoralized. The bull movement at length met\r\nits Waterloo in the spring of 1907, because the plunging millionaires\r\nwho had been bidding them up found no buyers for their stocks. So they\r\nhad to liquidate heavily, like the rest. It was another rich man’s\r\npanic.\r\n\r\nFrom a slow and irregular decline stocks good, bad, and indifferent\r\npassed into the rapids of a bear market, with the bears, emboldened by\r\nsuccess, recklessly aggressive, and on March 14th prices broke from ten\r\nto twenty-five per cent. under their fierce attacks, and relentless\r\nhammering, supplemented by an avalanche of long stock forced for sale\r\nunder stop orders that had been reached, or through weakened and\r\nexhausted margins, or by holders unwilling to take any further loss.\r\n\r\nYet enormous as was this paniclike fall in prices on that disastrous\r\nday, many stocks went still lower in the breaks that followed the sharp\r\nrally that succeeded it. So March, 1907, ended as it began, in gloom and\r\ndepression, which was followed by comparative dullness but little\r\nrecovery in April and May. In June, however, it became evident that\r\nliquidation had exhausted itself, and all unfavorable factors had been\r\ndiscounted by the decline. Hence, although the market was almost\r\nentirely professional, with the outside public as apathetic as ever, it\r\nbegan to develop an upward tendency, notwithstanding the sharp rise in\r\ngrain and cotton due to the extensive damage done by an unusually cold\r\nspring, and the fact that we shipped $15,000,000 in gold to France in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThis vast and thorough liquidation had been mainly by the bull pools and\r\nrichest speculative capitalists in Wall Street, and involved tremendous\r\nlosses. These leaders of the bull movement had been caught overloaded\r\nwith stocks, carried over from the previous boom that they had\r\nrecklessly engineered. They were forced to sell because the banks were\r\neither calling in their loans, which they were unable to replace, or\r\ncalling from time to time for more margin to offset the decline in\r\nprices. Thus their cash resources were being constantly impaired.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, money loaned at abnormally high rates, and five times in the\r\nspring, autumn, and winter of 1906 the New York banks showed a deficit\r\nin their reserve. Money, therefore, was very hard to borrow, because\r\nthese giants of speculation had overtaxed the banks’ resources by\r\nborrowing too much. Coincidently the outside public held aloof from the\r\nstock market, owing to the great activity of trade and the wild\r\nspeculation in land, mines, building, and other new enterprises all over\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThis speculation from Maine to California absorbed an immense amount of\r\nmoney, of which Wall Street saw nothing, and it left the large\r\nspeculative holders of stocks without any market for them, except among\r\nthe professional traders. No wonder they staggered, and finally, in the\r\nspring of 1907, succumbed under the heavy loads they were carrying,\r\nwhich they had mistakenly bid up to excessively high prices in a vain\r\nattempt to bring in the public as buyers. Wall Street was then the only\r\nblue spot on the map of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the pressure for money there, and so help to bull stocks, the\r\nlarge interests in Wall Street, excepting J. P. Morgan & Co., imported\r\nfrom Europe $40,000,000 of gold in the spring of 1906 and $45,000,000 in\r\nthe autumn.\r\n\r\nThis last great importation caused the Bank of England to raise its\r\nminimum rate of discount from three to four, then to five, and then\r\nagain to six per cent., the highest since the Boer War. The rate, it was\r\nintimated, would have been advanced to seven per cent. had we taken any\r\nmore of the yellow metal. The purchase of so much gold in England was\r\nmade possible only through the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Leslie M.\r\nShaw, practically advancing the means for importing it by lending gold\r\nto the banks, secured by collaterals, the loaned gold to be returned\r\nwhen the imported gold arrived.\r\n\r\nThe spring gold importations followed the great San Francisco earthquake\r\nand fire, on April 18th, involving an estimated loss of $250,000,000.\r\nMost of this, however, fell upon British, German, and other foreign\r\nfire-insurance companies, which relieved this country financially to a\r\ncorresponding extent, although New York shipped more than $50,000,000 of\r\ngold to San Francisco to fortify the banks in that city.\r\n\r\nAfter the stock market had been sold to a standstill and its weak\r\ntimbers eliminated, by May, 1907, it was only natural, in view of its\r\nprevious drastic liquidation and heavy decline, that with good crop\r\nweather following the backward spring, stocks should advance. The keel\r\nof a future bull market of large dimensions had been laid by the\r\ndisastrous liquidation that had occurred, and we subsequently witnessed\r\nits development on a rapidly ascending scale. It is a law of nature that\r\naction follows reaction.\r\n\r\nThis reminds us that Wall Street easily passes from one extreme to\r\nanother, and that very often the dawn is nearest when the night is\r\ndarkest, in finance as well as nature. Moreover, Wall Street is always\r\nwith us, just as the poor are, and the stock market is a serial story\r\nthat never ends.\r\n\r\nIn July, the improvement in the stock market, and especially the\r\nHarriman stocks, was very decided, with the indications favoring a wider\r\nand more active speculation, for as yet it was almost entirely\r\nprofessional. In this movement the Standard Oil and Harriman party were\r\nthe bull leaders, with Union Pacific the leading stock. Notwithstanding\r\ntheir vigorous efforts, however, the outside public remained entirely\r\napathetic, and there was growing anxiety as to the future of the money\r\nmarket. This was increased by our having, unexpectedly, to ship gold to\r\nEurope, nearly all of it to the Bank of France, as well as by depressed\r\nmonetary conditions there, with much disturbance, under heavy\r\nliquidations, in London and Berlin. Even British Consols declined from\r\nweek to week, till they touched 81, the lowest price recorded since\r\n1848, the year of the Smith O’Brien rebellion in Ireland, when they sold\r\ndown to 80.\r\n\r\nThen came an angry and threatening contest, and stormy litigation,\r\nbetween the States of North Carolina and Alabama and the Southern\r\nRailway Company, involving also other Southern States and railways. The\r\nmain conflict was between the States named and the United States Courts\r\non the 2¼ and 2½ cents a mile rate law. This went so far as to cause a\r\nrevocation of the license of the Southern Railway to operate its lines\r\nin Alabama. The situation for a time was extremely critical, but a truce\r\nwas at length arrived at, the Southern Railway agreeing to obey the\r\nState law, and leave the ultimate decision to the United States Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nWhile this disturbing controversy was at a white heat, the $29,240,000\r\nfine inflicted by Judge Landis, of the United States District Court, at\r\nChicago, on the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, fell like a thunderbolt\r\nupon not only Wall Street, but investors all over the country. This was\r\non Saturday, the 3d of August, and it looked so like confiscation, and\r\nso alarmed the large speculative capitalists, who had been supporting\r\nthe stock market, that they at once withdrew their supporting orders\r\nand, for self-protection, became heavy sellers themselves of the stocks\r\nthey held. They foresaw the effect of this disturbing decision, and the\r\ncourse of the Southern States towards the railways, upon investors, in\r\ncausing liquidation. Simultaneously, a threatening report from the\r\nBureau of Corporations added fuel to the fire of distrust.\r\n\r\nDay after day, for twelve business days, following the opening of the\r\nstock market on Monday, the 5th, there was an almost uninterrupted and\r\nvery heavy decline in prices for both railway and industrial stocks, the\r\nbest and highest priced being the heaviest sufferers, and falling from\r\nten to twenty-five per cent. The scare among holders of stocks increased\r\nas prices declined, and demoralization in the market carried these\r\ngenerally below the lowest in the panic of March. It was very largely\r\nanother rich man’s panic, due to fears as to what might come next to\r\ndisturb confidence in the value and future dividends of both railway and\r\nindustrial stocks. The worst of it was, the innocent were, as usual,\r\nmade to suffer with the guilty. But after a storm there cometh a calm,\r\nand so it was in this case, and perhaps all’s well that ends well. But\r\nthe ordeal was a very severe one, particularly for the large holders of\r\nstocks, and made the year 1907 still more memorable than before.\r\n\r\nRumors of impending Wall Street and industrial corporation failures, as\r\nusual in times of disturbance, filled the air, but only one important\r\nindustrial failure and one unimportant Wall Street suspension occurred\r\nin August, and the gradual return of confidence caused a gradual\r\nimprovement on the Stock Exchange, although the semi-annual dividend on\r\nSouthern Railway preferred stock was reduced from 2½ to 1½ per cent.,\r\nand the dividends on Erie’s first and second preferred stocks were\r\ndeclared payable in four per cent. scrip warrants instead of cash.\r\nToward the end of the month the Secretary of the Treasury announced that\r\nweekly deposits would be made in the national banks till October 15th,\r\nand this at once began to ease the money market and further strengthen\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, however, there came a relapse in the stock market,\r\nand another Stock Exchange failure. This recurrence of disturbance and\r\ndepression was partly due to stagnation, followed by demoralization in\r\nthe copper trade, both here and in Europe, which caused a reduction in\r\nthe price of copper by the selling agency of the Amalgamated Co. from 25\r\ncents a pound to 18 cents, and not long afterwards to 15 cents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Calumet and Hecla, the Quincy, and other copper companies\r\nhad reduced their dividends, owing to the small demand for copper, and\r\nAmalgamated copper stock declined rapidly to 57½, against 121 in\r\nJanuary. In Boston, also, the copper stocks broke in the same\r\ndemoralized way under heavy liquidation.\r\n\r\nRailway shares sympathized with this extreme weakness of copper and the\r\ncopper stocks, but not as much as American Smelting, the U. S. Steels,\r\nand other industrial stocks, and gradually the copper crisis ceased to\r\ndominate them. At the same time the general market for both railroad\r\nstocks and bonds was strengthened by the great success of the\r\n$40,000,000 issue of 4½ per cent. bonds by the City of New York, the\r\nloan being five times over-subscribed. This showed there was a large\r\namount of money in the country awaiting investment in good securities.\r\nYet, later, new low records were made for sundry railway and industrial\r\nstocks, including Southern Railway common and preferred, and the stock\r\nmarket, in its nervous and irregular fluctuations, told of the timidity\r\nof the bulls and the boldness of the bears, consequent on shrinkage in\r\nthe iron trade, and uncertainty as to the business future.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\n           THE GREAT CRISIS OF 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst forebodings of September were far more than realized in\r\nOctober, when the monetary disturbance, and distrust of credits, spread\r\nfrom the Stock Exchange and Wall Street to the banking interests, and\r\ninvolved the whole country in a panic that will always make the year\r\n1907 memorable in our history.\r\n\r\nUntil the collapse in the “Curb” market of the stock of the United\r\nCopper Co., followed, on the 17th of October, by the failure of the two\r\nStock Exchange firms that had been manipulating this Heinze specialty\r\nfor Heinze interests, the panicky conditions of the year had been\r\npractically confined to the stock market and the interests directly\r\naffected by it. But that collapse, involving those Heinze failures, fell\r\nlike a bombshell not only on the stock market, but on the banks of which\r\nF. A. Heinze, the president of the United Copper Co., had, not long\r\nbefore, purchased control. The fact that two of his brothers were\r\nmembers of one of the failed firms—Otto Heinze & Co.—caused heavy\r\nwithdrawals of deposits from these banks, and particularly the\r\nMercantile National Bank, of which he had become the president.\r\n\r\nThe New York Clearing House Committee took alarm the same day and\r\nexamined the Mercantile. The result was that it demanded the resignation\r\nof all its officers and directors that night, as a condition preparatory\r\nto giving it any assistance. They complied, President Heinze among them,\r\nand the bank was assisted to pay its clearing-house balances for several\r\ndays. But these were so large that further assistance was then refused.\r\nThereupon one of its old directors succeeded in bringing in new capital\r\nand new directors on the day following, Sunday, so that the bank was\r\nenabled to continue business without a break.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the contagion of distrust was spreading, and there was a\r\nrun on the deposits of not only the Heinze but the Thomas and the Morse\r\nbanks, the Thomases and the Heinzes having been equally prominent with\r\nMorse in buying control of banks for speculative purposes. The Clearing\r\nHouse Committee took them all in hand, and demanded the resignations of\r\ntheir officers and directors. In this way they stamped these bank\r\npromoters out of the banks they had managed to get control of. Then the\r\nbanks were assisted.\r\n\r\nSuspicion soon fell upon certain trust companies with speculative\r\naffiliations, more or less connected with the same promoters. Suddenly a\r\nheavy and spectacular run upon the Knickerbocker Trust Company, the\r\nsecond largest in New York, with more than sixty millions of deposits,\r\ncaused it to close its doors on the first day of the run. This was on\r\nTuesday, the 22d of October. The immediate cause of the run was the\r\nresignation, on the previous day, of Charles T. Barney, its president,\r\ncoupled with the notification to the banks of the National Bank of\r\nCommerce, on the same day, that it would not clear for the Knickerbocker\r\nTrust Co. after the following day. So, this being published in the\r\nnewspapers, the depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits.\r\n\r\nThe Clearing House and Mr. J. P. Morgan, when appealed to, refused to\r\nassist the Knickerbocker on the ground that they found it was not\r\nsolvent. The collapse of the Knickerbocker was immediately followed by\r\nextensive runs on small banks and trust companies in New York and\r\nBrooklyn, as well as on the savings banks, and about a dozen of the\r\nformer, including seven in Brooklyn, closed their doors. But the savings\r\nbanks took advantage of the sixty and ninety days’ time allowed them by\r\nlaw for the payment of deposits after notice.\r\n\r\nFollowing these minor banking suspensions there were long-continued runs\r\non the Trust Company of America and its Colonial Branch, and the Lincoln\r\nTrust Company, with all-night lines of waiting depositors. But, finally,\r\nafter a hard struggle, these were examined by Morgan committee experts\r\nand found solvent, whereupon, in the banking conferences held for a\r\nnumber of days and nights at the residence of Mr. J. P. Morgan, it was\r\nagreed to provide them with all the money necessary to meet the run. To\r\nMr. Morgan great credit is due for the arduous work he undertook to\r\nbetter the banking situation in this critical period of storm and\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nNew low records for stocks were made meanwhile under very heavy\r\nliquidation, Union Pacific touching 100, and Amalgamated Copper 41¾, on\r\nthe 24th of October, and all others sinking to lower depths in about the\r\nsame proportion, while the abnormal scarcity and high rates for money\r\ncaused trading on margins to be generally suspended by brokers.\r\nTransactions were, of course, largely curtailed by being placed on a\r\ncash basis, but the buying of odd lots for investment was very heavy all\r\nthrough the crisis. The decline in Amalgamated was accelerated by copper\r\nselling down to 12 cents a pound. But much of the liquidation in the\r\nstock market was caused by the banks and trust companies calling in\r\ntheir loans on stock collaterals, and thus forcing the borrowers to\r\nsell.\r\n\r\nThe hoarding of money, and the withdrawal of deposits from the banks and\r\ntrust companies, became so extensive that these institutions had little\r\nor none to lend, and for several days call loans were made on the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange at rates ranging from 50 to 100 per cent per annum,\r\nand in exceptional instances as high as 125.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _E. H. Harriman._\r\n  _1906_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Treasury came to the relief of the money market by\r\nmaking—under the personal direction of Secretary Cortelyou—unusually\r\nheavy deposits in the National banks of the City of New York, as well as\r\nin other cities which were drawing heavily on their New York balances.\r\nBut still the banks and trust companies continued to lose their ordinary\r\ndeposits rapidly, and the money thus withdrawn by the timid and\r\ndistrustful was taken out of circulation by being placed in safe-deposit\r\nboxes, tin boxes, wallets, and other receptacles. This hoarding was\r\nfoolish, as well as harmful and un-American.\r\n\r\nNew York had to deal with a banking crisis. So, on Saturday, the 26th of\r\nOctober, the members of the New York Clearing House met, and resolved to\r\nissue, on and after that date, Clearing House certificates—bearing six\r\nper cent interest—to be used by the banks of the Association in paying\r\ntheir daily balances at the Clearing House, instead of currency. These\r\nthe Clearing House at once began to issue, when called for by any bank,\r\nto the amount of 75 per cent of the value of any acceptable assets it\r\nmight deposit with the Clearing House. This gave immediate relief to the\r\nbanks, and especially those whose reserves of currency were most largely\r\ndepleted, for they immediately availed themselves of their issue.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they saw that, in addition to the government deposits,\r\nlarge importations of gold were necessary to replace, at least in part,\r\nthe hoarded money, and aid in restoring confidence. The Clearing House\r\ncertificates, by releasing much of their gold and legal tender notes,\r\nenabled them, through “cable transfers,” to purchase gold in England for\r\nshipment to New York, and by the end of the first week in November\r\n$50,000,000 had been purchased by banks and bankers for shipment to the\r\nUnited States, and nearly half that amount had already reached New York.\r\nBut some of the importing banks were in other cities, including Chicago,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, Pittsburg, and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThese heavy importations, however, disturbed the London money market,\r\nand on Thursday, the 31st of October, the Bank of England raised its\r\nminimum rate of discount from 4½ to 5½ per cent, to check the outflow of\r\ngold. This not proving sufficient, it raised it to 6 per cent on the\r\nMonday following, and to 7 per cent on Thursday, the 7th of November, a\r\nhigher rate than had been reached since 1873, the year of the great\r\npanic in this country and in Germany, when the Bank of England rate was\r\nadvanced to 9 per cent. But once, in 1866, it went up to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of France also, on the 7th of November, 1907, raised its rate\r\nfrom 3½ to 4 per cent, owing to the drain of gold to this country; and\r\nsuch an advance is very rare in France. For seven years, up to the\r\nspring of 1907, it had stood at 3 per cent. The Bank of Germany also\r\nadvanced its rate to 7½, and the Bank of Belgium to 6 per cent. These\r\nrates showed how severely the loss of this gold was felt in Europe. By\r\nNovember 16 our gold purchases aggregated $70,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the interval the clearing houses in all the large cities of the\r\nUnited States had, in self defence, followed the example of New York in\r\nissuing clearing house certificates. Currency, too, had been selling at\r\na premium ranging from 2½ to 5 per cent for certified checks, owing to\r\nits great scarcity. At Pittsburg the Stock Exchange was closed\r\nimmediately after the announcement of the failure of the three\r\nWestinghouse companies there. Other failures were very numerous.\r\n\r\nIn Pittsburg, Chicago, New Orleans, and many other cities, the local\r\nclearing houses printed clearing house checks of small denominations,\r\nfrom 25 cents or one dollar up, to be taken out and paid out by the\r\nbanks instead of currency, when found necessary. Several of the Western\r\nBoards of Trade closed, owing to the demoralization in the grain market,\r\ncaused by the heavy decline in prices under the rush to sell in order to\r\nraise money, while many banks all over the country issued their own\r\ncashiers’ checks for both small and large amounts, instead of currency\r\nor clearing house certificates, in payment of depositors’ checks. The\r\nbanks were in a partial state of suspension from Maine to California.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the drain on bank reserves may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat the statement of totals for all the New York associated banks for\r\nthe week ending on Saturday, November 2, showed that they were\r\ncollectively $38,838,825 below the dead-line of 25 per cent reserve on\r\ntheir deposits, without counting Government deposits, which had been\r\nvery large. The detailed statement of each bank’s condition was not\r\npublished on that date, and continued to be withheld till after the\r\ncrisis had passed into history.\r\n\r\nThis large deficit of the New York banks caused much uneasiness and a\r\nfurther sharp decline in the stock market, but the frequent day and\r\nnight conferences of leading bank officers with Secretary Cortelyou and\r\nMr. J. P. Morgan, to devise ways and means of relieving the extreme\r\nstringency and distrust of the monetary situation, were productive of\r\nmuch good. This was especially the case in bringing the trust companies\r\ntogether to act as a unit through a committee, of which Edward King,\r\nPresident of the Union Trust Co., was made chairman. This committee was\r\norganized in the office of J. P. Morgan & Co., which, indeed, was the\r\nheadquarters for all banking relief outside of the Clearing House.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Europe, our purchases there of so many millions of\r\ndollars’ worth of gold, within three weeks, seriously unsettled the\r\nLondon, Paris, and Berlin stock exchanges, and a continuous decline in\r\nstock and bond prices attended its export to this country. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the relief we obtained from this great source, the banks\r\nhere still continued under a heavy strain. An indication of this was\r\nfound in the statement of the New York Clearing House, giving the totals\r\nfor the week ending on Saturday, the 9th of November, the third week of\r\nthe acute stage of the crisis.\r\n\r\nIt showed that the deficit of the associated New York City banks, in\r\ntheir legal reserve, had increased $13,085,800 over that of the week\r\nbefore, making their total deficit $51,921,625. But as the Clearing\r\nHouse statements are made up on averages for each week, and not on the\r\nactual condition of the banks at the end of the week, the gold imported\r\nwas only credited from the dates on which it was received by the banks.\r\nMoreover, this statement was made on rising averages, that of the week\r\nbefore on falling averages.\r\n\r\nA conspicuously important feature of the arrangements made at the Morgan\r\nconferences for supplying the needs and taking care of the Trust Company\r\nof America was the sale, at par—$100 a share—of the majority of the\r\nstock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and R.R. Co.—which had been largely\r\nhypothecated with it—to the United States Steel Corporation, payment for\r\nthe stock to be made in its 5 per cent sinking fund bonds at 84. This\r\nexchange of Tennessee stock for the Steel bonds was promptly made\r\nthrough J. P. Morgan & Co., on and after November 7, thus adding another\r\nlarge property to the many other subsidiary properties of the U. S.\r\nSteel Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis transfer was one of the most notable events of the memorable panic\r\nyear—1907—the wreckage of which it will take a long time to clear away.\r\nBut meanwhile the country will have started on a new career of\r\nprosperity, and with eighty-four millions of people to develop its\r\nboundless resources, we need have no fear but that its recovery will be\r\nrapid, and its future as great and grand as we could desire. Moreover,\r\nit will be all the better and stronger, and all the higher in its\r\nbusiness standards, for the severe yet purifying ordeal through which it\r\nhas passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\n     THE CAUSES OF THE CRISIS OF 1907.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  An address by Henry Clews, LL.D., delivered at Cooper Institute, New\r\n  York City, February, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe wiseacres in Wall Street and elsewhere had to take many sledgehammer\r\nblows in this panic year. They had become like Tom Toddy—too big-headed\r\nfor their bodies. When a man knows it all, then his danger commences. My\r\nadvice is, never follow such a leader, but wait patiently and the time\r\nwill come when you can safely copper him.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1906, when stock and bond prices were advanced abnormally\r\nto a 3½ to 4 per cent basis, while six months’ money was loaning at 6\r\nper cent, it was evident that one or the other was too high; and\r\nconsidering the growing demand for the use of money it was quite\r\napparent it was not money that was too dear, but securities. At that\r\ntime I persistently advised everyone to get out of stocks and out of\r\ndebt, and keep out for a prolonged period, only making quick turns\r\nmeanwhile.\r\n\r\nSince then security values have gone down prodigiously—$3,500,000,000\r\nwill scarcely cover the depreciation of those dealt in on the New York\r\nStock Exchange alone; so those who took my advice and got out at top\r\nprices can well afford now to buy back their stocks, if dividends are\r\nnot reduced. No one can foresee changes in these. But everything that is\r\ngood is fairly cheap and below intrinsic value, based upon present\r\nreturns. Our financial situation is vastly different to any previous one\r\nafter great panics, of which there have been many, since the one of 1857\r\nbrought on by the failure of the Ohio Life & Trust Co., at the time of\r\nmy advent in Wall Street: so I have been in all these panics.\r\n\r\nThe conditions now differ from those of all the other great financial\r\nstorms because the wealth of the nation has become so vast as to make it\r\nthe richest in actual wealth and productiveness, per capita, of all\r\nnations. As a matter of fact, our wealth-making developments have been\r\nso excessive as to have forged ahead of our banking facilities. This has\r\nhad much to do with our recent setback. Wise and sagacious capitalists\r\nsaw the handwriting on the wall in Wall Street and elsewhere, and those\r\nwho did unloaded their securities last year, dumping their stocks at\r\ntop-notch prices, amounting to at least $800,000,000, upon weaker-backed\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis unloading, together with the San Francisco earthquake disaster,\r\nwiped out, in prices, $350,000,000 of property, and struck the\r\nstaggering blows which did more than anything else to pave the way to\r\nthe recent panic conditions. The selling out by big holders was followed\r\nby all the large railroad systems in the country selling bonds, stocks\r\nand notes. These, being offered to stockholders of record at apparently\r\ntempting prices, were floated. This great mass of new securities coming\r\non the market was an indigestible one and absorbed the capital of a very\r\nlarge number of the rich men of the country and put it in a fixed form:\r\nand most of these heretofore very rich men have ever since been in the\r\nposition of a man who, having had a “Sherry dinner,” is urged to accept\r\nthe hospitality of a friend to take a “Delmonico dinner.”\r\n\r\nWhat produced the panic was a number of adverse factors happening one\r\nafter another in rapid succession. The first was the unloading by\r\nsagacious holders of securities at high prices; the second was the\r\nimmense creation and selling of new securities by the railroads for\r\nimprovements; the third, the revelation of scandals started by Mr.\r\nHughes, the investigator of the life insurance companies. We all know\r\nwhat happened in that connection. Then came the Interstate Commerce\r\nexamination of Mr. Harriman as a witness and his revelations under oath;\r\nthen the $29,400,000 fine by Judge Landis on the Standard Oil Co. of\r\nIndiana, and finally, the insistence by Governor Hughes, against\r\noverwhelming opposition, of the passage of the Utilities Bill, under\r\nwhich the investigation of the Metropolitan Surface Railroad was started\r\nand which unearthed what really caused the shares of that great company\r\nto fall from their high price of $127 per share to $20 a share—about the\r\npresent price. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back and caused\r\nan entire breakdown of confidence; which is usually the major part of\r\nthe foundation of credit. The undermining of this caused the closing of\r\nthe doors of the Knickerbocker Trust Co. Then a state of chaos ensued\r\nand bedlam broke loose, and almost everybody in Wall Street stood aghast\r\nwondering what would happen next.\r\n\r\nAs I have faithfully presented my side of the case to you, in a crude\r\nway, I ask you, as though you were impaneled on a jury, the question:\r\nWhy should all the blame of producing the recent panic be laid to\r\nPresident Roosevelt? The real causes of all the trouble can be summed up\r\nas follows: (1) The high finance manipulation in advancing stocks to a\r\n3½ to 4 per cent basis, while money was loaning at 6 per cent and above,\r\non six and twelve months’ time on the best of collaterals; (2) capital\r\nall over the nation having gone largely into real estate and other fixed\r\nforms, thereby losing its liquid quality; (3) the making of injudicious\r\nloans by the Knickerbocker Trust Co., hence suspension; (4) the\r\nunloading by certain big operators of $800,000,000 of securities,\r\nfollowing which were the immense sales of new securities by the\r\nrailroads; (5) the California earthquake, with losses amounting to\r\n$350,000,000; (6) the investigation of the life insurance companies; (7)\r\nthe Metropolitan Street Railroad investigation; (8) the absurd fine by\r\nJudge Landis of $29,400,000 against a corporation with a capital of\r\n$1,000,000; (9) the Interstate Commerce Commission’s examination into\r\nthe Chicago & Alton deal and the results thereof.\r\n\r\nThese were substantially the causes which led up to and really brought\r\nabout our present disastrous condition. Did President Roosevelt do any\r\nof these things? Not one of them. But Governor Hughes was the brilliant\r\ninvestigator of the life insurance companies, and also unearthed the\r\nMetropolitan Railroad scandal through being the author of the Public\r\nUtilities law. Yet Mr. Roosevelt is condemned by many, while Mr. Hughes\r\nis praised by the people all over the country. I ask on this showing if\r\nthere is any justice in putting the entire blame for the present\r\ndisturbed state of financial affairs upon President Roosevelt’s\r\nshoulders, without including Governor Hughes, as both have been equally\r\nengaged in the same reform movement.\r\n\r\nI am not willing to affirm that either is to blame, for both have simply\r\ndone their duly in enforcing the laws, and exposing wrongdoing. How in\r\nmy opinion the market will turn permanently when the big men of Wall\r\nStreet commence to take back what they sold, which they can already do\r\nat a difference in prices of from 30 to 50 per cent. With the\r\n$70,000,000 of imported gold here and on the way from Europe, together\r\nwith an increase in bank notes, there will soon be no lack of money in\r\nthis country. What is now wanted is more confidence to increase credits.\r\nTo import more gold will embarrass London and other foreign money\r\ncenters. This should be avoided by stopping further gold imports. Cheap\r\nmoney alone will not of course put up stocks. The governing factors will\r\nbe the state of trade, and net earnings, and the “big men” will be\r\ngoverned by these.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\n              RECENT MEN OF MARK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES M. SCHWAB.\r\n\r\nBorn in Pennsylvania, May 30, 1851; rose, from the bottom, to be\r\nPresident of the Carnegie Steel Company, then, on its incorporation,\r\nbecame President of the United States Steel Corporation, but resigned,\r\nand later became President of the Bethlehem Steel Company; has large\r\nmining interests, especially in Nevada; he travels much, but resides on\r\nRiverside Drive, New York, in one of the largest houses in the city,\r\nbuilt as an exact copy of a historical French château near Paris.\r\n\r\n                           DANIEL GRAY REID.\r\n\r\nBorn in Richmond, Ind., August 1, 1858; became Vice-President of Second\r\nNational Bank there; then went into the tin plate industry, and in 1895\r\nbecame one of the organizers of the American Tin Plate Company,\r\nafterwards merged in the United States Steel Corporation; removed to\r\nChicago in 1897, and to New York in 1899, and was one of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the United States Steel Corporation when organized in 1901;\r\nalso became a director and leading spirit in the Rock Island Railway\r\nCompany in association with the two Moore brothers, William H. and James\r\nHobart, the Chicago reorganization lawyers. All three are now residents\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\n                          THOMAS FORTUNE RYAN.\r\n\r\nBorn in Virginia, October 17, 1851; came to Wall Street in 1870 from\r\nBaltimore and the drygoods trade; became prominent in the consolidation\r\nand extension of metropolitan street railroads, and also gas and\r\nelectric light systems here and in Chicago, and in the American Tobacco\r\nCompany, and later bought control of the stock of the Equitable and the\r\nWashington Life Insurance companies; has been director of many other\r\ncorporations, and is also Vice-President of the Morton Trust Company.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN WARNE GATES.\r\n\r\nBorn at West Chicago, Ill., 1855; kept a hardware store there; then\r\nbecame salesman in Texas for barbed wire; later established the Southern\r\nWire Company in St. Louis and Braddock Wire Company near Pittsburg;\r\nafter absorbing two other companies, sold out to Federal Steel Company,\r\nwhich was then absorbed by United States Steel Corporation. He thus\r\nacquired great wealth, and became a large operator in Wall Street, and\r\norganized the firm of C. G. Gates & Co., now dissolved. After buying\r\ncontrol in the open market of the Louisville & Nashville Railway, he\r\nsold it to J. P. Morgan & Co.\r\n\r\n                            AUGUST BELMONT.\r\n\r\nBorn February 18, 1853; son of the late August Belmont, and head of\r\nAugust Belmont & Co., bankers, and New York representatives of the\r\nRothschilds; is President of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and\r\nother corporations; also of the Coney Island Jockey Club and other turf\r\norganizations, and keeps up a large racing stable, is also a director in\r\na number of banks and railways and other companies, and politically,\r\nlike his father, a leading Democrat; is a member of many clubs and\r\nassociations; graduated at Harvard in 1875, and has a New York residence\r\nat 44 East 34th Street, but lives much of the year at his country home\r\nat Hempstead, Long Island. He is well known, too, as the financial\r\ndirector of the Belmont Tunnel, across the East River, between New York\r\nand Long Island City.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM H. MOORE.\r\n\r\nBorn in Utica, N. Y., October 25, 1848; located in Chicago with his\r\nyounger brother, James Hobart Moore, in 1873, and both were admitted to\r\nthe Illinois bar, and practiced as W. H. & J. H. Moore, making a\r\nspecialty of reorganizing corporations; reorganized the Carnegie Steel\r\nCompany, and formed the four corporations in “the Moore group” that were\r\nabsorbed by the United States Steel Corporation; later controlled the\r\nRock Island and other railway and industrial corporations, partly in\r\nconjunction with Daniel Gray Reid.\r\n\r\n                        ANTHONY NICHOLAS BRADY.\r\n\r\nBorn at Lille, France, August 22, 1843; came to the United States with\r\nhis parents when a child; opened a tea store in Albany in 1864, and\r\nafterwards other tea stores there and in Troy; became a promoter and\r\ndirector of gas and electric light corporations in Albany, Troy,\r\nChicago, New York, and other cities, and, later, of street railway\r\ncompanies in Brooklyn and elsewhere; acquired a controlling interest in\r\nthe People’s Gas Company of Chicago and a very large one in the Brooklyn\r\nRapid Transit Company, into which he merged his Brooklyn companies; is\r\nalso a large stockholder in the American Tobacco Company and many other\r\nindustrial companies; resides at 411 State Street, Albany, but his\r\noffice is at 54 Wall Street.\r\n\r\n                            STUYVESANT FISH.\r\n\r\nSon of the late Hon. Hamilton Fish, Governor of the State of New York\r\nand Secretary of State in General Grant’s Cabinet. Born June 24, 1851,\r\nat New York, N. Y. Educated at Columbia College, New York, graduated\r\n1871. Entered railway service October 1, 1871, after which he, up to\r\nJune 20, 1872, became clerk in the Illinois Central Railroad, New York\r\noffice; June 20 to October, 1872, secretary to president of same\r\ncompany; November 1, 1872 to December 31, 1874, clerk with Morton, Bliss\r\n& Co. at New York, and Morton, Rose & Co. at London; January 1, 1875 to\r\nMarch 15, 1877, managing clerk Morton, Bliss & Co., holding their power\r\nof attorney; December 14, 1876 to March 6, 1879, member New York Stock\r\nExchange; March 16, 1876, elected Director Illinois Central Railroad,\r\nand appointed treasurer and agent for purchasing committee New Orleans,\r\nJackson & Great Northern Railroad; November 8, 1877, elected secretary\r\nChicago, St. Louis & New. Orleans Railroad; and March, 1882,\r\nvice-president Chicago, St. Louis & New Orleans Railroad; January 7,\r\n1883 to April 2, 1884, second vice-president Illinois Central Railroad;\r\nApril 2, 1884 to May 14, 1887, vice-president; May 18, 1887 to November\r\n7, 1906, president same road; President American Railway Association\r\nApril 27, 1904 to April 25, 1906; Chairman Seventh Session International\r\nRailway Congress, Washington, D. C., May, 1905. Elected Director of the\r\nNational Park Bank, March, 1883, and so remains; elected a Trustee of\r\nthe Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York in the year 1888 and\r\ncontinued as such until February 23, 1906, when he resigned. What Mr.\r\nFish did for the Illinois Central Railroad Company while its President,\r\nis shown in the following extract from the London _Statist_, and also in\r\nthe Annual Reports of the Directors of the Company, which make a\r\nmarvellous exhibit of Mr. Fish’s able and sagacious management during\r\nhis long régime:\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Central is the most important of the systems running north\r\nand south between Chicago and the Gulf of Mexico. At one time its\r\nprosperity chiefly depended upon the cotton crop; but although this crop\r\nstill gives it a large traffic, its prosperity has been built up by the\r\nacquisition of a large share of the grain and maize traffic. In the old\r\ndays corn, or maize, was sent through the Western States for shipment\r\n_via_ Boston, New York, and Baltimore, but the Illinois Central has now\r\nsucceeded in diverting a vast portion of it to New Orleans. It now\r\nderives its revenue from carrying a large traffic at low rates in\r\ncompetition both with the Eastern lines and with the water transit of\r\nthe Mississippi; In recent years the Company has built extensions which\r\nnow enable it to participate in the coal and iron ore traffic required\r\nby or originating in the Birmingham iron district. The Illinois Central\r\nhas always enjoyed good management. In its early days, when the accepted\r\nprinciple of railway working was to charge high rates and to carry very\r\nlittle traffic, its policy conformed to that of other well-managed\r\nundertakings. For the past twenty years its policy has changed; it has\r\nsought to render to the public the maximum of service for the lowest\r\npossible rate. The success of this policy has exceeded all expectations.\r\nIn the twelve months to June 30th last the Company carried traffic at a\r\nlower rate than ever before, and yet obtained a record profit, both\r\nactually and relatively to its capital expenditure. This success has\r\nresulted from good management, economy of operation, and economy of\r\ncapital expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GOVERNOR HUGHES AND WALL STREET.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the present agitation at Albany, as recommended by\r\nGovernor Hughes, to investigate Wall Street methods, I do not hesitate\r\nto say that as the head of the firm of Henry Clews & Co. I am perfectly\r\nwilling at any time to allow a representative, appointed by either the\r\nFederal or State authorities, to examine the books of my firm, as the\r\nresult of such an examination can reflect nothing but credit on our\r\nbusiness methods. I should, however, object and refuse to show, in any\r\ninstance, the names of our customers, as our relations with them are\r\nconfidential and will not be betrayed. Ever since our firm was\r\nestablished we have made a practice of issuing notices of purchases or\r\nsales to clients, giving in each case the name of the broker from whom\r\nbought, or to whom sold. This is now, I believe, the custom in other\r\noffices, and is a guarantee that brokers execute the orders on the floor\r\nof the New York Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\n NEEDED PUBLICITY AND REFORM IN CORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYears ago I saw the inevitable end of the methods of some of the\r\nunscrupulous managers and manipulators of corporations, and began to\r\nagitate the employment of certified public accountants to examine into,\r\nand report to the stockholders, the true condition of the companies\r\ninvolved. Had my suggestions been adopted there would have been little\r\ncause for the recent investigation by the government officials, as the\r\nreform now sought would have been accomplished long before the present\r\nstringency of money became a disturbing element all over the world, and\r\nwould not have led to the semi-panicky conditions which prevailed so\r\ndisastrously in 1907. An address on “Publicity and Reform,” which I\r\ndelivered before the Wharton School of Finance, University of\r\nPennsylvania, in April, 1906, includes my urgent adoption of the policy\r\nI have referred to, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\nWe live in a progressive age, and we are at present passing through a\r\nperiod of salutary business reform. This reform means improvement, and\r\nbusiness men of all kinds should help and not retard it. The banking,\r\nrailway, and insurance communities should, in particular, do all they\r\ncan to promote it and invite the fullest publicity as to their\r\ntransactions and methods of doing business. In this connection the\r\nopposition developed in the New York Legislature to the investigation of\r\nthe banks was a mistake of judgment, because it was calculated to excite\r\ndistrust, whereas willingness to submit to thorough investigation would\r\nallay it.\r\n\r\nThis opposition drew more public attention to the agitation for a\r\ngeneral bank department examination than would otherwise have been\r\nattracted to it, and the unwillingness to submit to it suggested that\r\nthere was a screw loose, or something to conceal in connection with some\r\nof the State banks; and that they were therefore vulnerable to attack,\r\nor at least open to criticism. This suspicion those concerned should\r\nhave avoided by not only boldly facing the legislative music, but\r\ninviting it and leaving everything open and above board. Corporations\r\nand banking and mercantile firms that become at all objects of suspicion\r\nshould, in their own interests, speedily clear themselves, by inviting\r\nthe fullest examination and publicity. Unsoundness and irregularity, if\r\nsuch existed, would thus be exposed and weeded out, instead of being\r\nnursed in secret, and so doing harm and impairing confidence in\r\ncorporations and firms perfectly sound and regular in their methods and\r\npractices. The sound concerns would stand better than ever after passing\r\nthrough this ordeal of publicity. The New York Legislature, as well as\r\nthe Legislatures of the other States, should respond to the popular\r\nagitation for publicity by passing laws requiring all corporations,\r\nincluding banks and trust companies, to make at least semi-annual\r\nreports of their condition, certified to by registered public\r\naccountants, with power invested in the State Superintendents to order\r\nspecial examinations by such accountants, at any time, when deemed\r\nnecessary; that is, whenever they were suspected of being unsound or\r\nirregular in their business methods. This should be done for the\r\nprotection of others as well as to clear them of suspicion and restore\r\ntheir credit, if found to be sound and straight. Only the insolvent and\r\nthe crooked would have anything to fear from this wholesome publicity.\r\n\r\nIn this way disaster might be averted and impaired confidence promptly\r\nrestored. I lay stress upon the employment of skilled accountants\r\nbecause the certified results of their examinations would be accepted as\r\nconclusive of the actual conditions being as they stated or described.\r\nThey would speak with authority. It should be made a felony for an\r\naccountant to make a false or misleading report, and he should ever\r\nafter be disqualified from practising.\r\n\r\nTo meet the growing demand for them, every college and university should\r\nhave a department for the special training of accountants, who on\r\ngraduating should receive a diploma or degree, as in the medical or\r\nlegal profession. Already the position held by certified accountants is\r\nhigh, but it should be raised still more by the action of the\r\nuniversities and colleges. Some of these have established departments\r\nfor accountants, where the students undergo thorough training by men who\r\nhave had practical experience in the profession, but all institutions of\r\nlearning ought to have them and maintain them in a high state of\r\nefficiency in view of their importance to the business community. The\r\nopposition to publicity shown by the New York State banking interest, as\r\nrepresented in the Legislature, where it has choked off probing, has\r\nthereby aroused fresh suspicions and much adverse criticism. It is not\r\nsurprising that many are led to suspect that there is much concealed\r\nthat ought to be revealed.\r\n\r\nThe strong desire for secrecy in the management of corporations,\r\nespecially with life insurance companies, is obviously in defiance of\r\npublic sentiment, and the Legislature should now make the house-cleaning\r\nthorough while it is about it. If it does less it will fail in its duty.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed very surprising, under the circumstances, that the officers\r\nand trustees of the great life insurance companies should have supposed\r\nthat anything short of complete cleansing and purification would satisfy\r\ntheir policyholders and the public.\r\n\r\nThe bankers of the country are, more or less, intimately concerned in\r\nseeing this Augean insurance stable thoroughly cleaned out, for, unless\r\nit is, distrust will linger, and the life insurance taint will, more or\r\nless, continue to extend to the banks, bankers, bond dealers, and trust\r\ncompanies, with which the life insurance companies necessarily have to\r\ndo business.\r\n\r\nFor the banking interests to virtually ignore the past, and say to the\r\nlife insurance companies, “Go, and sin no more,” would be\r\npusillanimously evading the requirements of the situation. The cloud\r\nthat drifted over Wall Street from the insurance investigation must be\r\nentirely dispersed by the fullest investigation and publicity and the\r\nestablishment of a new regime in insurance management and its banking\r\nmethods and affiliations.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of life insurance trustees to co-operate to this end, and\r\nfor them to refuse to do so is to imply consciousness of their own\r\ninability to stand the searching ordeal. If such there be, owing to\r\ntheir purchases or sales of securities, in connection with their\r\nrespective companies, or any other doings that cannot bear the light or\r\nare open to criticism, they should be ventilated and exposed without\r\nfear or favor.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to smother further life insurance investigation, which had\r\ntheir counterpart in the opposition to the proposed banking department\r\ninvestigation, should be frowned down by public opinion, both in the\r\ninterests of morality and good business practices. The banks and the\r\nbanker should, like Caesar’s wife, be above suspicion, and not less so\r\nthe life insurance manager and trustee.\r\n\r\nTurning to the railways, we find the need of stricter laws in matters\r\nthat favor a few at the expense of the many, as, for instance, in the\r\ngiving of rebates. To prevent these, not a mere fine, which can be\r\neasily paid, should be imposed, but the offence should be made a\r\nmisdemeanor, punishable with imprisonment. Railway officials would then,\r\nwith the danger of an indictment and a term in prison before them,\r\nhesitate to violate the law. For their own reputation, as well as for\r\nthe sake of their families, they would be likely to avoid that secret\r\nand unlawful rate-cutting, disguised by the payment of rebates, which\r\nhas done so much in the past to foster unholy monopolies and crush\r\ncompetition to the ruin of thousands.\r\n\r\nIn the lime-light of publicity the irregular rebate practices of the\r\nrailways, for the benefit of large and favored shippers, would be\r\nimpossible; and equally so would have been the go-as-you-please and\r\nextravagant management of the life insurance companies as revealed by\r\nthe insurance investigation. Under the new order of things, regulated by\r\nstricter laws, it should be made impossible for these irregularities\r\never to occur. The death-knell should also be sounded by these stricter\r\nlaws and reforms of much of the “graft” that has been epidemic in\r\npolitical and business life. Publicity of accounts would be a protection\r\nto all solvent concerns and expose and eliminate the unsound and the\r\nfraudulent that would otherwise be a menace to them, and it should be\r\nwelcomed by all who have nothing to fear from such publicity.\r\n\r\nWe are passing through a reform—yea, a revolutionary period in business\r\naffairs. But good will come out of it, for with our improved business\r\nmethods will come a higher sense of responsibility and a keener\r\nperception of duty, which cannot fail to inspire correspondingly greater\r\nconfidence and produce more certain results. We shall thus have more\r\nconservatism in business and fewer speculative hazards and crookedness\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let the march of reform be unimpeded, for it will lead us to\r\na higher financial and commercial eminence than even that on which we\r\nalready stand, and hasten the time when this country will be the world’s\r\ngreatest financial and commercial centre.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that many need more conservatism and prudence in their\r\nbusiness ventures, and they would be the better for having the\r\nlime-light of publicity thrown on them. When the sky-rockets of the\r\nbusiness world fall they are not the only sufferers, for they injure\r\nothers who are perfectly sound and conservative by creating distrust of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe accounting and publicity I advocate would expose, check, and prevent\r\nthe irregularities and the one-man power abuses that have ended in so\r\nmany collapses. The one-man control of large corporations must come to\r\nan end. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\r\n\r\nCorporations, too, should show that they have souls by not neglecting\r\nthe welfare of their employes. They should promote their health by\r\ngiving them healthy surroundings where they work, and also by making\r\ngraduated provision for old age service, or pensions in case of\r\ndisability, after long service. This, or giving them a share in the\r\nprofits of the business, would do much to narrow the gulf between labor\r\nand capital.\r\n\r\nThe one-man power in large corporations, with a lot of dummy directors\r\nsubservient to it, should also come to an end. Dummy directors are no\r\nbetter than so many decoy ducks that mislead the public. They are\r\ndirectors who do not direct, and are not expected to direct by those in\r\ncontrol who selected them for election. They are consequently a false\r\npretence. No man ought to accept a place as director or trustee of an\r\ninstitution, or corporation, particularly in a banking, railway,\r\nindustrial or life insurance company, who does not fully appreciate the\r\nresponsibility of the position and the care and vigilance it demands,\r\nand intend to faithfully and conscientiously perform its duties. To\r\nintentionally become a dummy director is reprehensible, and directors in\r\ndealing with the officers of their corporations should have opinions of\r\ntheir own and not be afraid to express them. They are not alone\r\nresponsible for their own errors or wrongful acts, but for failure to\r\nexpose and put a stop to the wrongdoing of the officers or employees\r\nunder their control, and they should not assume such duties when they\r\ncannot properly attend to them.\r\n\r\nI once knew a man of very great business renown, who during the last\r\nthirty years of his life was much sought after because he possessed the\r\nqualifications necessary to make him a most satisfactory dummy or dumb\r\ndirector. Hence he was connected with a very large number of companies.\r\nHe was a man of wealth, retired from business, and had great capacity,\r\nbut it was of the avoirdupois kind. His chief qualification consisted in\r\nhis always attending punctually all the meetings. He came early and\r\nstayed till the end. He watched closely to determine which way the\r\nmajority vote was going and always went with it. He was never known to\r\nopen his mouth, except when the luncheon was served after the directors’\r\nmeeting had adjourned. He was much lamented by corporation managers when\r\nhe died. He was their favorite director, on the ground, as claimed, he\r\ngave no trouble and was perfectly satisfied with the result of every\r\nmeeting. When he was handed his five-dollar gold piece for attendance it\r\ncaused him to go home rejoicing. I cite him as a specimen brick among\r\ndumb and dummy directors.\r\n\r\nDirectors should make it their business to learn all that is going on in\r\nthe corporations and institutions that they direct, so that they may\r\nqualify themselves to act intelligently, instead of in a blindfolded\r\nway, as is too commonly the case. They should assert their rights, and\r\ndirect in fact as well as in name, but of course necessarily leaving all\r\nthe details to the officers. They, too, should avoid grinding axes of\r\ntheir own at the expense of their companies, and co-operate with both\r\nState and Federal officials in the strict observance and enforcement of\r\nthe laws, and never connive or wink at their evasion.\r\n\r\nAll these influences for the better would promote public confidence in\r\nour ways of doing business, and indirectly also contribute to the\r\nstability of our monetary position. What we greatly need is a more\r\nstable money market in Wall Street. Such erratic changes in the rates\r\nfor Stock Exchange loans that we sometimes see would create a convulsion\r\nin Europe if they were possible there. But as they are not possible\r\nthere, why should they be here? We are destined to ultimately become the\r\nmonetary centre of the world, but that cannot be till we acquire the\r\nstability of the Old World in interest rates.\r\n\r\nA freak money market, jumping up to absurdly high rates and then down\r\nagain, is as dangerous as it is intolerable. It is inimical to the\r\nproper transaction of legitimate business, and a disturbing factor that\r\nshould be made as impossible in New York as it is in London, Paris, or\r\nBerlin. What we need, among other things, to prevent it is more care and\r\nconservatism in banking circles. In the European money centres the rates\r\nfor money rise and fall in response to supply and demand, just as they\r\ndo here, but within narrow limits beyond which they never pass. There is\r\nno good reason why it should not be so with us.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the eminently well qualified members of the\r\ncommittee appointed by the New York Chamber of Commerce—consisting of\r\nMessrs. Vanderlip, Conant, Straus, Claflin, and Clarke—will reach a\r\nsolution of the problem of the money market and define how far its\r\nvagaries and irregularities are owing to a want of sufficient currency,\r\ncapital, or credit, or sudden and excessive demands for loans,\r\nconsequent on excessive activity in speculation, or unwillingness to\r\nlend in times of distrust and panic.\r\n\r\nIn European countries monetary stability can always be relied upon; and\r\nthat element of stability, which our money market now lacks, must exist\r\nhere before we can command the confidence of the world as the world’s\r\nfinancial centre. But we are now rapidly taking steps in the right\r\ndirection, and the reform movement in business and legislation can come\r\nnone too soon for our national welfare. Let the good work of reform go\r\non and prosper, for from it we shall reap an abundant harvest in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThere was no good and sufficiently sound reason why money, on call,\r\nshould have loaned in Wall Street at rates ranging from 100 to 125 per\r\ncent. per annum—as it did in December last, when in other cities all\r\nover the country it loaned no higher than six per cent. These money\r\nspasms, while local in their actual effect, exert a disturbing and\r\ndemoralizing moral influence which is far-reaching. Such pernicious\r\nactivity in the money market is not natural. It is due to artificial\r\ncauses and ill-regulated methods affecting our local supply and demand.\r\n\r\nFor the rates of interest to be leaping wildly up and down, in the loan\r\ncrowd of the Stock Exchange, and changing violently every few moments,\r\naccording to the shifting bids and offers of the excited borrowers and\r\nlenders, would seem to be absurd and laughable enough for opera bouffe.\r\nBut in the banking and Stock Exchange business it is a serious evil,\r\ninvolving large results.\r\n\r\nSuch an abnormal money market is, of course, not very often seen, but it\r\noccurs often enough to make it important for us to study its causes and\r\nseek a remedy for such monetary excesses. It is indeed a topic so\r\nserious as to call for the gravest consideration. Yet neither the\r\nstringency nor these minute to minute, or hour to hour, fluctuations\r\nwere caused by any fluctuation going on in the volume of the currency or\r\nany except local influences.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to guard against and prevent is these occasional spasms.\r\nAgainst the slow general rise and fall of interest rates for money of\r\nfrom, say, 2 to 6 per cent per annum and vice versa, there is nothing to\r\nbe said, for the movement is a legitimate one, a natural result of the\r\nvarying supply and demand. We see it in the Old World, as well as the\r\nNew World, but such rocket-like soarings, and such eccentric ups and\r\ndowns as Wall Street has experienced from time to time, are peculiar to\r\nitself. It must, however, outgrow them, and the sooner it does so the\r\nbetter. It is not my purpose in this address to show how the end in view\r\nmay be best accomplished, but that it can and will be accomplished\r\nwithin no long time is certain. The fault is not so much due to the want\r\nof elasticity in our currency system as to our local methods of doing\r\nbusiness in stocks and lending and borrowing money to carry them.\r\n\r\nThe causes of general monetary stringency are always apparent, but the\r\ncause of the local scarcity of cash that sends the money rate up 5, 10,\r\n20 or even 50 per cent in an hour or so among a small group of borrowers\r\nand lenders in the Stock Exchange, could evidently be avoided, as it is\r\nin Europe, and it is the business and duty of both borrowers and lenders\r\nhere to avoid it.\r\n\r\nOne thing tending to produce occasional local stringency is that our\r\nmoney market has to contend with the evil effects of the New York\r\nSub-Treasury, or rather the Sub-Treasury system, that locks money up\r\nthat ought to be kept in circulation. Every Sub-Treasury acts\r\npractically as a Government bank, just as the old United States National\r\nBank in Philadelphia did, and takes in all the money it can get, but\r\npays out none, except on Government vouchers. So it does not perform all\r\nthe functions of a bank, and we should have a more elastic currency if\r\nthe Sub-Treasury system were abolished, which it doubtless will be in\r\ntime. Theoretically, we have no United States National Bank, yet\r\npractically we have one in every Sub-Treasury. Until Congress amends the\r\nSub-Treasury and National Currency laws, the banks and trust companies\r\ncould by a united understanding prevent extreme money rates, by agreeing\r\nnot to charge in excess of 10 per cent interest; or, what would be\r\nbetter still, 7 per cent, on call loans during periodical money strains.\r\nWhile they would lose some immediate profits, they would be abundantly\r\ncompensated later on by making New York a greater, safer, and stronger\r\nfinancial centre, which would materially increase their business.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, emergency currency may be issued by the banks in times of\r\nstringency. This, in effect, releases them from the limit on reserves,\r\njust as, in panics, a Government order in council releases the Bank of\r\nEngland from the limit placed on its note issues, and allows it to issue\r\nits notes to an unlimited extent. The consequent inflation of the\r\ncurrency under both the German and English systems, and the revival of\r\nconfidence produced by it, brings relief in the money market.\r\n\r\nBut our only way of obtaining similar relief is for the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to order Treasury deposits to be made in National banks on the\r\nsecurity of United States bonds, or if he is willing to accept them,\r\nfirst class State or city bonds. Assuming the banks to have the bonds,\r\nthe Treasury may not always have the money to spare for this purpose\r\nbeyond its proper working balance, and at the best it is a make-shift\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThat we need a more elastic currency is indisputable, and also such\r\nchanges in our custom of borrowing and lending money on collaterals on\r\nthe Stock Exchange as will secure stability in rates of interest there,\r\neven in times of stringency. The time will come when the circulation of\r\nthe National banks will be based on gold, instead of United States\r\nbonds, and in that way our monetary system will more closely approach\r\nthat of the principal European nations. But we need not prepare to cross\r\nthe bridge until we come to it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other matters referred to, it is always well to\r\nstrike while the iron is hot, and at present the reform movement in\r\nlegislation affecting life insurance and banking concerns is at white\r\nheat, not only in the State of New York, but elsewhere, and it should be\r\npressed forward until all the results aimed at are secured.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, to accomplish this the life insurance and bank\r\ninvestigations already in progress, or proposed, should be carried out\r\nto the fullest extent, and, through the employment of expert and\r\nindependent book-keepers and accountants, made so thorough as to leave\r\nnothing hidden or in doubt. The results in detail should then be\r\npromptly published, and in a form that all could understand, so that the\r\npublic would know the plain, unvarnished truth. In this way rumors and\r\nsuspicions of underhand doings, bribery and corruption, graft, fraud,\r\ndeficiencies in accounts, misappropriation of funds, and concealed\r\ninsolvency, would, if not confirmed, be contradicted and swept away,\r\nthus leaving the concerns before under suspicion in all the better\r\ncredit and standing.\r\n\r\nNot only should all this be done now, but the State Legislature should\r\nbe equally prompt in passing the laws necessary to maintain this high\r\nstandard of publicity in the future, and making it mandatory upon the\r\nbanking and insurance departments to order frequent examinations into\r\nthe condition of all State banks and banking and insurance concerns by\r\nexpert accountants, and publish their findings. All opposition to such\r\ninvestigation and publicity is of itself calculated to excite suspicion,\r\nwhether it comes from banks, trust companies, life insurance officers,\r\nand trustees, or other concerns, or parties in interest. Industrial and\r\nother corporations of all kinds, including railways, ought also to be\r\nmade, by mandatory laws, subject to stricter supervision and periodical\r\nexamination as to their financial condition. Hence the Attorney-General\r\nof this and other States should be invested with new powers to this end,\r\nand the provisions of the laws should be made mandatory upon them. They\r\nshould call for verified statements of earnings, profits, expenses,\r\ncapitalization, indebtedness, dividends, property valuations,\r\nliabilities and assets, so that large corporations would cease to be\r\nblind pools, and fraud and misrepresentation would be checked by being\r\nexposed; and it is exposure and publicity which is most dreaded by those\r\nwho prefer crooked ways to open and above board business methods and\r\nintegrity of purpose. But those who have nothing to hide have much to\r\ngain from it, and should welcome the lime-light of this new era of\r\npublicity. Secrecy is only the defence of the weak.\r\n\r\nThe recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the\r\nTobacco and Paper Trust cases, that corporations cannot take refuge in\r\nsecrecy, but must give testimony as to all their transactions, when\r\nrequired, even where it is self-incriminating, is a great victory of the\r\npeople. It marks the beginning of a new departure in corporate\r\nmanagement by enforcing existing laws, and requiring that publicity of\r\naccounts, which large industrial, railway, and other corporations, and\r\nmost notably the large industrial trusts, have hitherto so strictly\r\nguarded against and avoided, after the blind pool fashion.\r\n\r\nThe decision is that the law as it stands, giving a witness the\r\nconstitutional privilege of refusing to give testimony tending to\r\nincriminate himself, does not extend to or cover his refusal to produce\r\nbooks and papers that would incriminate his, or any other corporation,\r\nthe immunity being wholly personal. He cannot, therefore, assert it\r\neither in behalf of a third person or a corporation, yet strange to say\r\nthis clear and convincing reasoning has never been put forward by\r\nlawyers opposing the trusts. But it will make the way of the corporation\r\ntransgressor harder in the future.\r\n\r\nIt opens the door and clears the way for a thorough, complete, and\r\npublic examination of the affairs and accounts of the trusts. It removes\r\nthe first loophole for their escape from the consequences of their\r\nunlawful acts, and from the exposure of their methods of opposing and\r\ncrushing competitors. They will, therefore, become liable to prosecution\r\nunder the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, and all unlawful combinations,\r\nschemes, and conspiracies will be effectually and permanently broken up.\r\n\r\nThis decision is pf such vast and far-reaching importance, not only to\r\nall directly concerned, but to the whole country, that its legal effect\r\nand its moral influence can hardly be overestimated. It will probably\r\nbecome as famous in the history of the Supreme Court as the Dred Scott\r\ndecision; and it will prevent in future the miscarriage of justice for\r\nwant of evidence against corporations, which has so frequently occurred\r\nin the past. It will also raise the moral tone of corporate management\r\nby enforcing publicity before refused, for the decision not only applies\r\nto all railway and industrial corporations, but banks, trust companies,\r\nand insurance companies of all kinds. It shows that a rigid enforcement\r\nof existing laws is alone necessary to correct many abuses of long\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nThe temptation that secret acts and secretive general management present\r\nto those disposed to wrongdoing and chicanery, malfeasance,\r\nmisappropriation, and graft can easily be imagined; and it can also be\r\nas easily inferred that such management is apt to give rise to\r\nsuspicions and rumors detrimental to the interest of the corporations\r\nconcerned, and indirectly injurious to others. Honesty is not only the\r\nbest polity, but a moral duty, and should be as much the watchword of\r\ncorporations as of individuals, and no man should betray his trust for\r\neither love or money, whether acting in or out of a corporate capacity.\r\n\r\nThere is more permanent prosperity, as well as honor, to be secured by\r\nhonest than dishonest means, and to quote the Bible, “What does it\r\nprofit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Yet\r\nunscrupulousness in high places of trust is often forced upon public\r\nattention. This should all be swept away as a debasing element in\r\nbusiness life, for dishonesty, like the upas tree, casts a blighting\r\ninfluence wherever it is.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of judges and juries and the bribing of legislators\r\nshould be more abhorrent than larceny itself to every captain of\r\nindustry and all corporate officials, who should have equal respect for\r\nthe truth and their own honor. Great wrongdoers should be no more exempt\r\nfrom punishment than small offenders and mere millions should furnish no\r\nprotection to them.\r\n\r\nGreat fortunes accumulated by monopoly and oppression, and other\r\ndishonest means, are no credit to their possessors, but really a\r\nreproach, and the abuse of power by them is a great national evil. Every\r\nbusiness man should take pride not only in his regard for honesty,\r\ntruth, and fair dealing, but in his own personal honor, whether he is\r\nacting for a corporation or himself. We are now on the highroad to the\r\ncorrection of a multitude of abuses and the country is to be\r\ncongratulated upon this salutary movement for improvement and reform in\r\nour business methods. Our great remedy is PUBLICITY, and the enforcement\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nThe immensity and grandeur of our national progress and achievements\r\njustify us in looking forward to a still greater and grander development\r\nin the future and still more splendid triumphs of mind over matter than\r\nwe have already accomplished. I do not say with the spread-eagle Fourth\r\nof July orator:\r\n\r\n              “No pent up Utica controls our powers,\r\n               But the whole boundless continent is ours.”\r\n\r\nYet it cannot be ignored that no other nation has such a magnificent\r\ncareer of expansion, development, and progress before it as the United\r\nStates, united as it is by telegraph and telephone and our vast network\r\nof railways, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and Maine to Florida, in\r\nunbroken continuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. MOORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the growth of our population, which even now exceeds eighty\r\nmillions, we shall grow more and more in national importance and wealth,\r\nnot only in material wealth but in the higher products of an advancing\r\ncivilization, in the arts and sciences and literature, and all that\r\nembellishes and glorifies mankind. Therefore we should, as we go along,\r\nconstantly endeavor to correct errors, shortcomings, and abuses, and\r\nprune away rotten and unsound timbers in our public and business life,\r\nand make the whole machinery of business and activities of all\r\nkinds—trade, banking, insurance, manufacturing, legislative, and the\r\nvarious professions and mechanical industries, work as legitimately,\r\nhonestly, smoothly, and harmoniously as possible. The way to do this can\r\nbe best paved by promoting public spirit, and sweeping away the\r\nopportunities for business wrongdoing in secret, such as rebating, by\r\nwise laws properly enforced, and backed by public opinion, yet laws not\r\noppressive, unjust or too inquisitorial. This would compel the “crooks,”\r\n“grafters,” “rebaters” and “competition crushers” of the business world,\r\nwho have schemed in darkness, and shunned the light, to come out into\r\nthe open view, and this publicity alone would be a perfect cure for many\r\ngreat evils. So let us have more light—the light of PUBLICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\n  THE MONETARY SITUATION AND ITS REMEDIES.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  An address to the West Virginia Banking Association at their 13th\r\n  Anniversary Meeting, at Elkins, West Virginia, June 19, 1906, by Henry\r\n  Clews.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of our population, the great activity of all our\r\nindustries, the general prosperity of the country, apart from the\r\nterrible calamity at San Francisco, and the immense speculation going on\r\nin land and mining ventures, especially in the West, are the underlying\r\ncauses of the severe monetary stringency that New York has lately\r\nexperienced. These influences have kept money to a much larger extent\r\nthan usual active in the interior and prevented its concentration not\r\nonly in New York and the other Eastern monetary centres, but at the\r\nWestern centres.\r\n\r\nChicago in particular found that money, instead of returning there from\r\nthe interior in good volume, as it usually does in January, February,\r\nand March, continued this year to be sent to the interior by the banks\r\nthere at an average rate of $12,000,000 a month during these three\r\nmonths. This movement was not so much owing to the land and mining boom\r\nas to the immense absorption of money in the various manufacturing,\r\nmercantile, and other expanding business interests all over the West and\r\nSouth. So great was, and still is, the activity in these directions that\r\nspeculation in grain, provisions, and stocks has been more neglected in\r\nthe West than for several years, as the narrowness of the markets there\r\nhas shown.\r\n\r\nTo show more precisely the effect on the money markets of this unusually\r\ngreat speculative and industrial activity it is only necessary to say\r\nthat, during this first quarter of the year 1906, the Chicago banks\r\nsteadily and heavily lost in deposits, while their loans kept\r\nincreasing. A comparison of the condition of the national banks in that\r\ncity on April 6th, as reported to the Comptroller of the Currency, with\r\ntheir condition at the date of their previous report on January 29th,\r\nshowed an increase in their loans of $8,625,237 (or 4.11 per cent) and a\r\ndecrease in their deposits of $6,773,490 (or 2.11 per cent) and a\r\ndecrease in cash resources of $14,628,960, or 10.38 per cent. These\r\nfigures explain why money was so scarce in New York. The West had none\r\nto send us, although there is more money in circulation than ever\r\nbefore. If we go back to the condition of the same Chicago banks on\r\nMarch 14th, 1905, and compare it with their report referred to, we still\r\nfind that their deposits decreased $8,687,117 and their cash resources\r\n$7,970,318, while their loans increased $1,599,774; and in their reduced\r\ncash resources the Chicago banks reflected the condition of the banks in\r\nall the other large cities of the West, Northwest, and Southwest. There\r\nhas been a rapidly rising volume of trade and land and mining\r\nspeculation there for more than a year, and enormous activity in new\r\nindustrial enterprises. In the Southwest, particularly, the growth of\r\nbanking has been not only unprecedented but enormous. I include in this\r\ndesignation the States of Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and\r\nKansas and the Territories of Oklahoma, Indian, New Mexico, and Arizona.\r\nThe last decade has witnessed in this section of our country more\r\nextensive and rapid material development than was ever before seen\r\nanywhere, either in the United States or elsewhere, and this expansion\r\nin banking was in response to that material development, and therefore\r\nhad a legitimate foundation in business requirements. American spirit\r\nand enterprise, and Western push, overcame all obstacles in spreading\r\ncivilization and creating trade, especially in the new settlements.\r\n\r\nIn the five years ending with 1900, 101 new national and other banking\r\ninstitutions were established in these nine States and Territories—with\r\na consequent increase of $94,500,000 in individual deposits and\r\n$150,300,000 in aggregate resources, and in the next five years ending\r\nwith 1905 no fewer than 1,415 new banks and banking institutions were\r\nadded to the number—a resulting increase of $73,400,000 in capital and\r\nsurplus, $383,750,000 in individual deposits and $670,350,000 in\r\naggregate resources. Thus, in ten years, there was an increase of 1,516\r\nin the number of banks, of $137,000,000 in capital and surplus, of which\r\n$79,000,000 was surplus, of $478,000,000 in individual deposits, and of\r\n$820,750,000 in aggregate resources.\r\n\r\nThis enormous banking development reflected and stimulated the enormous\r\ndevelopment of the country, and aided trade fully as much as trade\r\nhelped the banks. The one kept pace with the other, and marvelous\r\nprogress in both was the result; and this progress continues, and will\r\ncontinue indefinitely long under the stimulus of the rapidly increasing\r\npopulation of that still sparsely settled section.\r\n\r\nThis banking development is of incalculable benefit, both locally and\r\ngenerally, for its influence is far-reaching. The drain of money from\r\nthe outlying districts, including New York, to move the crops, is\r\nreduced as banking facilities in the West and South increase.\r\n\r\nIn the South, during the same period, there has also been very great\r\ncommercial and banking development, with the banks and trade going hand\r\nin hand to help each other, as in the Southwest. The South was never\r\nbefore so active and prosperous; and, rapidly as it is progressing, it\r\nwill go on prospering with unabated vigor and enterprise, for it has\r\nentered upon a new era of prosperity and immense development of its\r\nmaterial resources awaits it. In manufacturing and mining, as well as\r\nagriculture, immense opportunities are open to it; and before long the\r\nnatural increase of its population will be largely added to by the white\r\nimmigration that it needs. So the South has a bright and magnificent\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThis vast industrial and mercantile activity—this general business\r\nenterprise, this land and mining speculation, or boom, has extended, in\r\nvarious degrees, all over the United States, and the influence it has\r\nhad on the money market in large cities, and particularly in New York,\r\nwas only a natural and easily foreseen result. It has produced a\r\ncorresponding activity in money, because of the greater demand for its\r\nuse; and the real estate speculation, the vastest we have to deal with,\r\nis still increasing.\r\n\r\nThe boom is almost entirely in land and mostly in vacant plots, or lots,\r\nsuitable for building purposes; but there is also a very active\r\nspeculation in improved property, and much speculative building. The\r\namount of money practically locked up in this land speculation is much\r\nlarger than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nStatistics of 29 of the largest cities of the United States show that in\r\nthe month of May they issued permits for the construction of 13,712 new\r\nbuildings, to cost $55,074,761, against only 12,036 in May, 1905, to\r\ncost $50,791,738, an increase of 8 per cent, and a similar increase was\r\nshown in each preceding month of 1906. The May increase was greatest in\r\ncities remote from the Atlantic Coast; in Portland, Oregon, it was 309\r\nper cent; in Tacoma, 111 per cent; in Seattle, 30 per cent. But the San\r\nFrancisco catastrophe was evidently the main cause of the large increase\r\nin Portland and Tacoma. Yet the increase in Omaha was 75 per cent, in\r\nSt. Paul 49 per cent, in Duluth 110 per cent, in Louisville 50 per cent,\r\nin New Orleans 47 per cent, and in Chicago 39 per cent. These figures,\r\ndry as they may seem, are eloquent in their suggestiveness of the extent\r\nof the demand for money from this one source, the land and building\r\nboom.\r\n\r\nGold and silver mining speculation, too, last year began to assume the\r\ndimensions of a boom in Nevada, and all the old metal and mineral mining\r\ncamps, and many new ones in other States, are, like the Lake Michigan\r\ncopper regions, scenes of active speculation in properties, as well as\r\nbusy with mining, and hosts of speculators are their own bankers,\r\ncarrying large amounts of currency in their pockets.\r\n\r\nThe money that usually returns to the money centers is thus widely\r\nscattered and too busily employed to return. So we have to deal with a\r\nperiod of prosperity and industrial activity that is something more than\r\nnormal. But—without referring to the heavy drain of cash for the relief\r\nof San Francisco, which was offset by gold imports—although money was\r\nscarce in New York, owing to this enormous activity and general\r\nprosperity that kept it moving from hand to hand, it was not scarce\r\nenough to justify the excessively high rates we often witness on the\r\nStock Exchange. These were serious and hurtful, and to guard against\r\nsuch vicissitudes in our money market every member of the Stock Exchange\r\nand every banker and bank officer should use his influence.\r\n\r\nHow far the Chamber of Commerce Committee on the Reform of the Currency\r\nwill succeed in providing remedies for the monetary situation remains to\r\nbe seen. But from the twenty-seven questions it has sent to bankers and\r\nothers it is apparent that it contemplates no fundamental change in our\r\ncurrency system. Inferentially, it will not interfere with United States\r\nlegal tender notes, nor with United States bonds as a basis for the\r\ncirculation of the national banks. Yet both bases are indefensible on\r\nsound economic principles. The issue of greenbacks was merely a war\r\nmeasure, and intended to serve only a temporary purpose; instead of\r\nwhich we have made it permanent, so keeping the Government in the\r\nbanking business with its war currency system.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the false bottom on which the national\r\nbank currency rests; for paper, that is, paper money, should not be\r\nsecured by, or redeemed in paper, even when that paper is as\r\nindisputably good as United States bonds. All our paper money ought to\r\nbe based on readily convertible assets and redeemable in gold. Bonds,\r\neven United States bonds, by which national bank notes are now secured,\r\nare only evidences of debt, and the time will come when these will be\r\nliquidated, and the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nThe committee probably thinks that the existing order of things,\r\nnotwithstanding its fundamental errors, is too deeply rooted and\r\nstrongly fortified to be materially changed without danger of the remedy\r\nproving worse than the disease. It consequently favors more national\r\nbank currency on the present basis. Branch banks and rediscounting for\r\nsmall banks by large banks are also favored. The committee’s questions\r\nindicate, however, that it favors the abolition of the Sub-Treasury\r\nsystem, and to that result it should resolutely bend its energies. At\r\npresent the Sub-Treasuries are practically banks, like the old United\r\nStates Bank at Philadelphia, with the important difference against them\r\nthat all the money they take in remains locked up in their vaults till\r\npaid out on Treasury drafts. The evil effect on the money market, and\r\nparticularly on Wall Street, of thus withholding money from circulation\r\nin periods of stringency has been too often felt. It was more than\r\nusually conspicuous and severe during the late tight money ordeal, owing\r\nto the Treasury receipts very largely exceeding its disbursements. This\r\ngreatly aggravated the scarcity of money in New York, due to other\r\ncauses, and resulted, in Wall Street, in the rates for call loans\r\nranging at times, within the last six months, with rapid and eccentric\r\nfluctuations, from 15 to 30 per cent, and on one occasion touching 125\r\nper cent. We have here a phenomenon entirely distinct from ordinary\r\nmonetary conditions.\r\n\r\nThese extremely high and highly fluctuating rates are, it is true,\r\npeculiar to the New York Stock Exchange, but they are none the less a\r\ngreat evil, and they acquire national and even international importance\r\nfrom the fact that New York is the financial center of the country and\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange the barometer of financial values for the\r\nwhole United States.\r\n\r\nHowever much our commanding position may in other respects fit New York\r\nto be the world’s financial center, it cannot aspire to and secure that\r\nposition of power so long as it is the scene of these violent\r\nfluctuations in the rates of interest for call loans on the Stock\r\nExchange. Measures should therefore be taken not only to prevent them,\r\nbut to make their recurrence impossible; and how this can be best and\r\nmost efficiently accomplished is a matter for very serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThat it can be accomplished is evident from the entire absence of any\r\nsuch violent rate oscillations in the money markets of Europe. There the\r\nrates of interest fluctuate slowly within a reasonably narrow range,\r\ngenerally between 3 and 5 per cent, the extremes being 1 or 2 above, or\r\nbelow, these figures. Such unreasonable eruptions in the money market as\r\nwe have sometimes seen in the loan crowd of the New York Stock Exchange\r\nwere never seen, and would be impossible, in London, Paris, Berlin, or\r\nany other European capital. Why, then, should they ever occur, or be\r\npossible here?\r\n\r\nIn response to questions propounded by the Chamber of Commerce Committee\r\nI would say that, as the Sub-Treasury system is a disturbing factor in\r\nthe money market, provision should be made by Congress for the regular\r\ndeposit in national banks of surplus Government money above its regular\r\nworking balance of fifty millions, the banks to pay interest at 2 per\r\ncent per annum thereon.\r\n\r\nBank notes, in my opinion, are a form of bank obligation the same in\r\nprinciple as bank deposits, payable on demand, and these notes, as the\r\nmost convenient form of credit, should be released as much as possible\r\nfrom restrictions not necessary to secure their safety, acceptability,\r\nand redemption in gold, or United States legal tender notes, for so long\r\nas the latter may be kept outstanding.\r\n\r\nIn seeking increased flexibility for our currency I would not suggest\r\nanything that would impair the value of United States bonds as a basis\r\nof circulation; but it deserves consideration whether new currency might\r\nnot be issued by moderately increasing, above the par of the bonds but\r\nnot above their average market value, the amount of notes to be secured\r\nby them. Then, too, why should not national banks be authorized to issue\r\na fixed proportion of circulating notes upon their general resources,\r\nthese to be secured by a guaranty fund? To induce the retirement of\r\nthese notes when not needed, owing to money being superabundant at low\r\nrates, this asset circulation could be made liable to a graduated tax.\r\nThe proportion of notes to capital that should be allowed, and the\r\namount of the tax, are matters upon which bankers differ, but I favor\r\nstrict moderation in both. This asset currency, under moderate\r\nrestrictions, for use under ordinary conditions, would be far preferable\r\nto any emergency circulation, ISSUED UNDER A HIGH TAX, although\r\nSecretary Shaw recommended it in his report for 1905.\r\n\r\nAs the taxes collected upon the circulation of national banks from 1864\r\nto the end of June, 1905, amounted to $96,220,997, and the failed banks,\r\nduring that period, had outstanding only $17,295,748 of notes, and the\r\ndividends paid on their claims averaged 77.95 per cent, it follows, at\r\nthe same ratable proportion of loss, that the deficiency on account of\r\ntheir notes would have been only $3,813,712, or 22.05 per cent of their\r\ntotal circulation. So in the light of this experience I see no great\r\nrisk in a guaranty fund, consisting of the taxes paid upon circulation,\r\nnor do I see why it would not be sufficient to redeem all the notes of\r\nfailed banks.\r\n\r\nI would make the asset currency a first lien upon the assets of the\r\nissuing banks, and allow the banks to redeem their notes at appointed\r\nredemption places in the large cities. This would save the trouble and\r\ndelay of sending them to Washington, and by facilitating redemptions\r\nwhen money was easy, give more ebb and flow to the currency and tend to\r\nprevent excessive speculation in times when there is a glut of money.\r\nUnder the Canadian banking system there are several central redemption\r\ncities for bank notes; but I would not, as is the case in Canada, limit\r\nthe right to issue notes to banks of not less capital than $500,000.\r\nThere is safety in numbers, in regard to banks as well as other matters.\r\nThen, too, it would be well to make all the Sub-Treasuries in the\r\ncountry useful as national bank note redemption points, because it would\r\ncontribute to the elasticity of the currency in the same way that it\r\ndoes in Canada, and doubtless Congress would favor such a measure.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to establish a new bank in Wall Street with $50,000,000,\r\nor even more, capital, or to increase the capital of an existing bank to\r\nthat extent, to serve the purposes of Stock Exchange borrowers, and\r\nregulate rates of interest, after the manner of the Bank of England, is\r\ndeserving of no consideration whatever. It would merely excite and\r\nprovoke the jealousy and opposition of other banking institutions, and\r\ncreate a sort of monopoly with special privileges, without securing the\r\nend in view. A Bank of Banks is not what we want, nor do we want a\r\nrevival of the old United States Bank.\r\n\r\nSuch a bank as the Bank of England, or the Bank of France, could not be\r\ncreated here, either in a day or a generation, for those time-honored\r\ninstitutions are the growth of ages. They are very much older than any\r\nof the other banks there; and, under the control of their respective\r\ngovernments, they have grown up with their countries and become\r\npractically, although not by ownership, government institutions. Hence\r\ntheir prestige and power, and the impossibility of other banks\r\nsuperseding them.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, deserve consideration whether the New York Clearing\r\nHouse might not exert power in regulating rates of interest similar to\r\nthat exercised by the Bank of England, providing the banks belonging to\r\nit would unite to give it that power; and is there any reason why they\r\nshould not? Even without any formal or concentrated action in this\r\ndirection, outside of the Clearing House Committee, it could appoint a\r\ncommittee to name every week, or oftener when necessary, as the Bank of\r\nEngland does, a minimum rate of interest on call loans and discounts. It\r\ncould also fix a maximum rate for each. This need not be compulsory; but\r\neven only as a recommendation it would have a powerful moral effect, and\r\nthe Wall Street banks, if they approved of the innovation, would conform\r\nto it. The Clearing House could, indeed, after the formal approval of\r\nthis regulation by its members, enforce its observance under penalties,\r\nif deemed necessary. In this alone, in my opinion, a practical remedy\r\nwould be found for the high rate evil on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, greater elasticity could be given to our national\r\nbank currency if Congress would amend the law so as to permit of\r\ncurrency being issued against specified bank assets, subject to the\r\napproval of the Comptroller of the Currency. This is a feature of the\r\nbanking system of other countries, which has always worked very well and\r\nto the satisfaction of all interests; and what our currency urgently\r\nneeds is greater elasticity.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, according to economic principles, we cannot expect a\r\nperfect currency, with all the resiliency and elasticity possible in a\r\ncurrency, so long as bonds instead of gold are used as the basis of our\r\nbank circulation. Yet for security the bonds are, under present\r\nconditions, just as good as gold; and there would be more elasticity in\r\nthe bank circulation based upon them if the restrictions imposed upon\r\ntheir redemption by the Act of 1882, which are now unnecessary, were\r\nremoved. Indeed, the inability to promptly retire bank notes is one of\r\nthe worst faults of our system, and Congress should repeal the\r\nrestrictions without delay. If this obstacle in the way of resiliency\r\nwere removed, and the unlimited retirement of bank notes permitted, we\r\nmay rest assured that free expansion, when demanded, would quickly\r\nfollow curtailment, and this ebb and flow of the currency would\r\nobviously be an elastic movement.\r\n\r\nAs it is, there is a great waste of banking power in our treatment of\r\nnational bank notes and reserves. We have $544,765,959 of national bank\r\nnotes, and only $337,130,321 of United States legal tender notes, and,\r\nsetting gold aside, the redemption of the former in the latter is\r\nobviously absurd and inconsistent with sound finance and good banking.\r\nWe see in the present system this $544,765,959 of banking capital\r\nabsorbed and represented by non-reserve currency. The capital is\r\nperfectly safe, but it is locked out of any other use, and rendered\r\ninefficient for any other purpose. This calls for a remedy. The\r\npercentage of reserves to loans in national banks has decreased from\r\nmore than 20 per cent in 1898 to less than 15 per cent. Hence the bank\r\nreserves require to be increased.\r\n\r\nThe law relating to the redemption of national bank notes in United\r\nStates notes, or greenbacks, was passed when the greenbacks very largely\r\nexceeded the bank notes in amount, but the reversal of these conditions\r\nreminds us that the tail is now wagging the dog. This alone makes it\r\nclear that the law should be amended.\r\n\r\nBut beyond all this we should open our money market more to the rest of\r\nthe world by establishing a new factor, which would always afford prompt\r\nrelief in times of stringency, by giving us cable transfers of gold,\r\ninstead of gold shipments, and of itself prevent abnormally high rates.\r\nThrough this medium we could, instantly, practically draw gold from\r\nEurope whenever wanted, and Europe could do the same from us, when\r\nneeded there. I refer to the establishment of an International Gold\r\nTransfer System, or Clearing House, to supersede and dispense with what\r\nI may call the old-fashioned gold see-saw. Gold in circulation is doing\r\ngood work, but gold see-sawing across the ocean is going to waste. The\r\ncustom of shipping gold from one country to another, in response to the\r\nups and downs of the market rates for foreign exchange, not only reminds\r\nme of the forward-and-back movement in a quadrille, but suggests that,\r\nas the precious metal is rendered practically useless while in transit,\r\nit should not be used in a dance of that kind across the ocean. The\r\nsubject may not seem to be very important, but it really is so, for\r\n“tall oaks from little acorns grow”; and it is surprising that in the\r\nmarch of modern improvement this method of settling international\r\nbalances has not been superseded by a shorter, quicker, and cheaper cut\r\nto transatlantic adjustments. Bankers, in both hemispheres, are absurdly\r\nbehind this progressive and electric age, in transporting gold from the\r\nNew World to the Old, and vice versa, to adjust balances between them,\r\nwhenever the rates of exchange show a profit in the transaction. That\r\nthey could profitably dispense with it is obvious, as they could easily\r\nestablish this transfer system, this international clearing house for\r\ngold, at very small expense. Thus the risk, and loss of time, involved\r\nin the old-fashioned method would be eliminated, while the new\r\narrangement, being under their own control, would beyond peradventure\r\nserve every necessary purpose of the shippers, combined with perfect\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of shipping boxes or kegs of gold to and fro between\r\nAmerica and Europe is apparent when we consider that it is a\r\ntime-wasting see-saw performance, which involves the expense of packing,\r\ncartage, freightage, insurance, and loss of interest while in transit,\r\nand still greater loss due to abrasion consequent on sea transportation,\r\nto say nothing of bankers’ commissions, and risk of partial or entire\r\nloss by robbery, accident, or marine disaster; ignoring, moreover, the\r\nrestraints it imposes upon our foreign trade.\r\n\r\nAll these disadvantages could be obviated and this handicap upon our\r\ncommerce removed by a mutual-interest arrangement, between the leading\r\nbanks in the United States and Europe, to deposit a sufficiently large\r\namount of gold on each side of the Atlantic, and issue international\r\nclearing-house certificates and draw bills of exchange against the\r\ndeposits. This gold could be counted as part of their reserve, if in\r\ntheir own vaults; or the Bank of England, in London, and the United\r\nStates Sub-Treasury in Wall Street, could be used as the gold\r\ndepositaries. We have a clearing house for bank checks in each of the\r\nlarge cities, and one also for the transactions of the New York Stock\r\nExchange. London, too, has its bank clearing house. Why, then, should\r\nthe clearing house system not be extended to international transfers of\r\ngold, so as to make them possible at any moment by cable-telegraph\r\ninstead of the slow process of six-days transfers? In this way our\r\ninternational dealings would be quickened and extended and our financial\r\nand commercial relations become more intimate.\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason why we should unnecessarily treat gold as we do,\r\nwhen we can save time, money, and risk by keeping the metal where it is,\r\nand issuing certificates of deposit against it, and the use and transfer\r\nof which would serve as well as gold shipments.\r\n\r\nThe present custom becomes a ridiculous “chasse” across the Atlantic,\r\nwhen we see the same gold shipped to Europe, then shipped back to\r\nAmerica within a few days after reaching its destination, without being\r\nunpacked, owing to sudden intervening changes in the rates of exchange,\r\nmaking it profitable for the former gold exporting country to import the\r\nmetal. Such wasteful shilly-shally procedure would be likely to excite\r\nmirth in opera bouffe, but bankers who ship gold are very serious about\r\nit, and seem to be without enough perception of the ludicrous to see\r\nanything funny in its coming and going, although they feel the shoe\r\npinch in its costliness in both time and money. As the world’s gold\r\nproduction increases the urgent need of this over-sea change will become\r\nmore and more conspicuous, and its adoption will accord with the\r\ngenerally progressive spirit and methods of our telegraphic and\r\ntelephonic age.\r\n\r\nHad such an international gold clearing house existed the sagacious but\r\nunprecedented action of the Secretary of the Treasury, to relieve the\r\nmoney market by making deposits, as secured loans, in certain banks, to\r\nencourage and cover their prospective gold importations from Europe, the\r\nsame to be returned on the arrival of the gold, would have been\r\nunnecessary. While this expedient has well served a temporary purpose,\r\nit is not to be relied upon as a permanent source of relief during\r\nmonetary stress, and it involves a stretch of authority under the law\r\nthat is open to grave objection. But, as it happened, the Secretary’s\r\naction, which was taken just before the San Francisco disaster occurred,\r\nproved particularly fortunate, and probably prevented a very serious\r\naggravation of the stringency in the money market, owing to the heavy\r\nremittances to California. It was a piece of good luck that seemed\r\nalmost providential, and the end justified the means. But it should\r\nalways be regarded as only a fortuitous circumstance and temporary\r\nexpedient, not as a permanent source of relief; and it emphasizes our\r\nneed of a new international gold transfer system. Moreover, the benefit\r\nEurope would derive from it would be equal to our own.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, under the circumstances, acted wisely in also increasing\r\nthe Treasury deposits in the national banks, while the Government’s\r\nreceipts were largely in excess of its disbursements, so as to offset,\r\nas far as possible, this preponderance of receipts, and lessen the drain\r\nof money into the Sub-Treasuries. But this method of relief is, too,\r\nonly a temporary expedient, to remedy the evils of the Sub-Treasury\r\nsystem. While the Sub-Treasury system lasts Congress should authorize\r\nthe Secretary to deposit customs, as well as internal revenue receipts,\r\nin the national bank depositaries, in time of stringency, when the\r\nGovernment’s receipts exceed its disbursements, and it has more than a\r\nsufficient working balance. The Government should, as a compensation to\r\nit, require the banks to pay interest at, say, two and one-half or three\r\nper cent per annum on such deposits, these not to exceed, in amount, 25\r\nper cent of their paid-up and unimpaired capital, and to be returnable\r\non demand, but without requiring these special deposits to be secured.\r\nThey should, however, be made a first lien upon the assets of the banks.\r\n\r\nIf the changes above suggested were made, I am sanguine that they would\r\nprove to be remedies for the evils and disadvantages under which we now\r\nlabor, and so increase the stability of our money market and improve and\r\nfortify the machinery of the whole monetary system, while giving more\r\nelasticity to the currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\n      INDIVIDUALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  An address delivered by Henry Clews on Sunday afternoon, May 12, 1907,\r\n  at the Columbia Theatre, Brooklyn, in debate with Professor\r\n  Kirkpatrick, graduate of Albion College, Michigan, and former\r\n  professor in the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn order that I may present a clear understanding of my view of the\r\nsubject, it is only fair, in the first place, to state that the system\r\nof Individualism which I shall endeavor to uphold is worthy and\r\ncommendable. I hold it to be superior in every sense to any of the\r\nvarious plans of Socialism offered by its advocates. By this I do not\r\nmean Individualism in the extreme sense of the term, for, as we all\r\nknow, in no civilized country and under no form of government whatsoever\r\ndoes, or can, extreme Individualism exist.\r\n\r\nIn the world of economics and politics Individualism has a distinct\r\nmeaning, as a name given to the theory of government which favors the\r\nnon-interference of the State in the affairs of individuals. It has also\r\nbeen well defined, as the private ownership of the means of production\r\nand distribution, where competition is possible; leaving to public\r\nownership those means of production and distribution in which\r\ncompetition is practically impossible.\r\n\r\nIt will, then, be at once apparent that, in the consideration of the\r\nforces helpful and necessary to society, the individualist believes that\r\ncompetition which encourages merit and develops skill should remain\r\nparamount. And right here the issue is made, between Individualism and\r\nSocialism, the Socialist denying that competition is beneficial to\r\nsociety, but contending rather that it is a deleterious and harmful\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nUpon this issue, so joined, I stand firmly in favor of the principle of\r\ncompetition, and that system of Individualism which guards, protects and\r\nencourages competition. It is that system of government under which we\r\nlive to-day—a government of the people, by the people and for the\r\npeople—the United States of America—a free system of government, in the\r\nbest and broadest sense of the term.\r\n\r\nUnder this free system of government, whereby individuals are free to\r\nget a living or to pursue wealth as each chooses, the usual result is\r\ncompetition. Obviously, then, competition really means industrial\r\nfreedom. Thus, any one may choose his own trade or profession, or, if he\r\ndoes not like it, he may change. He is free to work hard or not; he may\r\nmake his own bargains and set his price upon his labor or his products.\r\nHe is free to acquire property to any extent, or to part with it. By\r\ndint of greater effort or superior skill, or by intelligence, if he can\r\nmake better wages, he is free to live better, just as his neighbor is\r\nfree to follow his example and to learn to excel him in turn. If any one\r\nhas a genius for making and managing money, he is free to exercise his\r\ngenius, just as another is free to handle his tools.\r\n\r\nIn this primary outline of the free system of Individualism, it is well\r\nalso to consider the good side of freedom or Individualism. It is an\r\naxiom, well established, that the freer men are to choose their work and\r\nto use and enjoy its results, the more work they are willing to do.\r\nTheir energy and enterprise are called out, their wits sharpened, their\r\nhopes stirred. If any one wins unusual success, others are encouraged to\r\ntry better methods. If an individual enjoys his money, gained by energy\r\nand successful effort, his neighbors are urged to work the harder, that\r\nthey and their children may have the same enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThus, every one accomplishes more in a condition of freedom or\r\nIndividualism, and the whole nation is richer, than if custom or a\r\nSocialistic community fettered and restricted men, and compelled them to\r\nwork according to rule. With matured individuals, this is on the same\r\nprinciple that children enjoy their sports better, when left to\r\nthemselves, than if a parent or teacher were to meddle and make rules\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nI believe that it can be stated, as an established fact, that whenever\r\nmen are, as individuals, free to work, to earn and to save and use their\r\nearnings as they deem fit, the capable, the industrious, the temperate\r\nand the intelligent everywhere tend to rise to prosperity. The skilful\r\nare always in demand and at good wages. And remember, that a day’s wages\r\nnever purchased so much in supplies as it does in the United States,\r\nwhere we use the individual or competitive system of work, because high\r\nas prices are, wages are still higher.\r\n\r\nAs a further part of this summary of Individualism and competition, let\r\nus also add the moral side, for it is a considerable and important item.\r\nWhen men labor, earn or save with perfect freedom, they develop many\r\nmoral qualities, such as patience, self-reliance, self-sacrifice,\r\nventuresomeness, integrity, generosity and respect for others’ rights.\r\n\r\nIf a Socialistic committee of the wisest men could manage and make rules\r\nfor the rest, and provide for every one’s necessities, men would not\r\nacquire or exhibit these sterling qualities of manhood, as well as they\r\nwould by being thrown upon their own resources.\r\n\r\nWe know this, also, from the fact that the strongest characters have\r\nbeen worked out in brave and patient competition and conflict, often\r\nunder difficult circumstances; whereas the men who have never been\r\nthrown upon their own resources rarely amount to anything.\r\n\r\nAfter this preliminary description of the worth and salient influence of\r\nIndividualism, under which our country has grown to be the greatest\r\nnation of the world, let us now turn to Socialism—a system which, if\r\nadopted, would call a halt to our progress, tear down our established\r\ninstitutions, and turn our great prosperity into ruin and decay.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to tell just what is meant by Socialism in the more\r\nmodern sense of the term.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared in the United States under five different and almost\r\ntotally disconnected forms. It has appeared as a movement towards the\r\nestablishment of Socialistic communities or communisms; it has appeared\r\nas Fourierism, as German or International Socialism, as Nihilism and\r\nChristian Socialism.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mallock, the eminent English writer, in his lectures in New\r\nYork, made a careful analysis of Socialism, and exposed its plausible\r\nsophistries, some of which, Socialists boast, are grounded on our\r\ndefined principles of political economy, which the learned writer\r\nasserts are rather incomplete. It may be admitted that this is so, and\r\nthat fuller and clearer distinctions could well be added to our text\r\nbooks on the subject. But, joining the issue in a clean-cut way, between\r\nIndividualism and Socialism, obviates all necessity at this time of\r\nfurther considering such distinctions, and clarifies our respective\r\npositions in this debate.\r\n\r\nIt was noticeable that, during the delivery of these lectures, hints and\r\nremonstrances were freely thrown out that the structure that Dr. Mallock\r\nwas attacking was not Socialism at all, in the modern acceptation of the\r\nterm, but something else that had long ago been abandoned.\r\n\r\nNow, while I have no unfriendliness whatever with the honest Socialist\r\n(mistaken, deluded and sadly out of place in this grand Republic, as he\r\nmay be), I do say, that this position is but too often the wily\r\nsubterfuge, sought to be taken advantage of by the insincere agitator or\r\npretended reformer, when he sees that he is beaten. His invariable\r\nanswer to an irrefutable argument is: “Oh, that which you talked about\r\nis not modern Socialism!”\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this discussion, however, we can agree that, as\r\ncontradistinguished from Individualism, Socialism opposes and denounces\r\ncompetition as an injurious and unnecessary force in society, and\r\nadvocates the collective ownership, through the State, of all the means\r\nof production and distribution.\r\n\r\nSocialists would, in other words, fence up the great field of free\r\nopportunity, deaden all incentive or inspiration for great achievement,\r\nand not only curtail, but wholly remove, the right to compete and excel,\r\nand make it impossible to write “success” as the result of individual\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nJust think of that! Why, the very thing that the Socialists attack, as\r\nuntenable and wrong in government—individual competition—has done more\r\nthan anything else to make us what we are as a nation to-day; has kept\r\nalive the precious fires of liberty and freedom and has preserved the\r\ninstitutions of our country. Take away the spirit of Individualism from\r\nthe people, and you at once eliminate the American Spirit—the love of\r\nfreedom—of free industry—free and unfettered opportunity—you take away\r\nfreedom itself!\r\n\r\nAnd right here, I take the position and shall ever contend, that the\r\nUnited States (of all countries in the world) is no place for Socialism.\r\nLet us never forget that it was founded by the wisdom and patriotism of\r\nthe Fathers of the Revolution, and that it is blessed with a\r\nConstitution, framed by men who loved individual freedom and national\r\nliberty, and who risked their lives and sacrificed their property in the\r\nstruggle to overthrow injustice and oppression and achieve independence\r\nand individual equality. Let us not forget its past one hundred and\r\nthirty years of eventful history, replete as they are with many chapters\r\nof severe trial, over all of which it has ever risen superior. This\r\nsplendid history has placed our system of government beyond the line of\r\nexperiment, and raised it to such an elevation of recognition and\r\nrespect, that it now ranks as the highest among all the nations of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBorn of the spirit of resistance to oppression, with the broadest and\r\nfreest constitution that the world has ever known—a land of freedom and\r\nequality in the best and most liberal sense of the term—it would seem\r\nthat the sincere lover of liberty and equality could ask no better home\r\nthan this democracy of ours—whose glorious flag floats over eighty-four\r\nmillions of prosperous and enlightened people.\r\n\r\nTo further add, the term “contented people” might, perhaps, not be a\r\nstrictly true assertion, and neither would it, in my opinion, be a\r\ndesirable one to use; for to the spirit of discontent and ambition, so\r\npredominant in the American character, are due largely the grand\r\nachievements and the remarkable progress and advancement of our nation\r\nin all things that make for greatness, strength, and public welfare.\r\nHowever, we must be careful to draw a plain line of contradistinction\r\nbetween that discontent which is really the mainspring of human\r\nactivity, and which, appreciating the solidity and soundness of our\r\nfoundation, aspires to build thereon to the highest ideals of perfection\r\nand success—and that misguided or malicious discontent of Socialism\r\nwhich arrays itself as an enemy of all civilized forms of government and\r\nseeks their utter destruction.\r\n\r\nWe can well understand and appreciate, in a country ruled by a despot,\r\nwhose heel of oppression and tyranny is ever on the necks of the\r\ndown-trodden people, the feeling of the masses who, desiring some\r\nmeasure of free action and equality, would revolt against such\r\nconditions, and seek a reorganization of society. They would, naturally,\r\nlook as far away as they could from such a government of despotism—the\r\nonly one they had ever known—to the other extreme—a country where the\r\nState should own all the land and capital, employ all the people, and\r\ndivide everything, share and share alike, among the community.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of revolt, which in that case may be patriotism, becomes\r\nridiculous and open to the charge of insincerity when the tenets of its\r\ndoctrine are transplanted and cultivated upon American soil by our\r\nforeign population.\r\n\r\nWith further reason, also, must we question the sincerity of the\r\nSocialist, who, leaving oppression behind, emigrates to this country,\r\nwhere tyranny and despotism are unknown, and yet who continues to echo\r\nthat war cry of destruction wrung from his heart by the cruelty of his\r\nold-time oppressors.\r\n\r\nHe comes here from a land of want and thraldom to a land of plenty and\r\nfreedom. He may come without name, fame, or property, and he is received\r\nwith open arms. After a brief residence he is entitled to full\r\ncitizenship, and is then a part of the government, enjoying all the\r\nrights and privileges of the native born. Besides the active or public\r\nequality—the equality possessed by all, the right to share in the\r\ngovernment, such as the electoral franchise and eligibility to public\r\noffice—he has the rights of private equality. He is possessed of legal\r\nequality—the equal possession of private civil rights enjoyed by all\r\ncitizens. Then there is the equality of material conditions—that is, the\r\nright to acquire wealth and all that wealth implies.\r\n\r\nEvery opportunity to achieve success and happiness abounds on every\r\nhand, and every incentive to industry and accomplishment awaits him; and\r\nif he is energetic and skilful, there is nothing to hinder him from\r\nbecoming prosperous, or, in other words, successful in whatever vocation\r\nin life he may pursue. With qualities that commend themselves to his\r\nfellow men, there is no limit to the possibilities of his achievements,\r\nand very soon (as has been very often the case) he may become a leader\r\nof men. If, therefore, he is sincere, surely he must agree with me that,\r\nin view of these conditions, this is no place for the Socialist. And\r\ndoes it not sound like a paradox to hear this cry of Socialism still\r\nrending the air—while every avenue of fortune lies open to every one?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _D G Reid_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism is self-contradictory, and opposed to deep-rooted and\r\nineradicable human instincts. Its origin is, of course, purely selfish;\r\nbut there are two kinds of selfishness—the enlightened and\r\nunenlightened. Unfortunately, Socialism belongs chiefly to the latter.\r\nIt is often overlooked that the identical love of gain which seeks to\r\nequalize the distribution of wealth will not be satisfied with equality.\r\nA desire for gain will still remain and seek to acquire. The most\r\ncommendable object in Socialism is the uplifting of the down-trodden and\r\npoor. Yet that great commoner and tribune of the people, William\r\nJennings Bryan, tells us that under Individualism we have seen a\r\nconstant increase in altruism. That the fact that the individual can\r\nselect the object of his benevolence and devote his means to the causes\r\nthat appeal to him has given an additional stimulus to his endeavors.\r\nAnd Mr. Bryan pointedly asks the question: “Would this stimulus be as\r\ngreat under Socialism?” Let it not be forgotten that by means of present\r\ntendencies and existing economic laws the poor are constantly growing\r\nricher. They were never so prosperous as to-day. Labor has made great\r\nstrides, and the uplift in the lower walks of life in all Christendom\r\nduring the past twenty years has been beyond precedent. Give us wise and\r\njust legislation, and complaints about the inequitable distribution of\r\nwealth will quickly disappear.\r\n\r\nThe state of society that the Socialists seek to establish may be\r\nbeneficial to a class which, under any conditions, lacks frugality,\r\nthrift, and self-reliance; but just where the general mass of humanity\r\nis to be bettered or elevated, socially, morally, or politically, is a\r\npoint not satisfactorily explained. A society in which all human beings\r\ndo right, for the simple reason that it is right, cannot exist unless\r\nhuman nature is recast and reconstructed. Human nature must be treated\r\nas it is found in the general makeup of man, and, therefore, a society\r\nin which all special desires, all ambition, and all self-esteem have\r\nbeen eliminated, precludes development and progress. It reduces\r\neverything to utter shiftlessness and stagnation. In such a Society\r\nthere can be no incentive to great achievements in art, literature,\r\nmechanics, and invention. If all are to be placed on an equal footing,\r\nthe ignorant with the educated, the dullard with the genius, and the\r\nprofligate with the provident, what encouragement is there for special\r\neffort?\r\n\r\nIf you render accessible to each and every member of the human family\r\nthe achievements and benefits of civilization, holding “property in\r\ncommon,” why should a man rack his brain or strain his muscles in\r\nproducing something which he expects to prove remunerative to himself in\r\nsome way, but which, under the Socialistic state, would go to the equal\r\nfinancial benefit of all?\r\n\r\nJust for a moment, stop to think of the effect of bringing all men as\r\nnear to a dead level as possible, for I recognize that not even\r\nSocialism would secure the equality which it seeks. If one physician is\r\nmore skilful than another, who could insist that he receive no better\r\nreward than the less skilful, when many would be willing to offer it? Or\r\nhow else could he avoid having all the patients in the community upon\r\nhis hands except by charging more for his services than an inferior\r\nphysician? If one lawyer shows greater ability than another, is he not\r\nentitled to a larger fee for his talent? And how else is he to protect\r\nhimself from taking all the business from the lawyer of less ability?\r\nAgain, if the skill of the cabinet maker is higher and rarer and worth\r\nmore than that of the carpenter, how can the latter expect the same\r\ncompensation as the former? To put both on the same plane would be\r\nunjust, and would lead to one being compelled to work beyond his\r\nstrength, while the less skilful would probably be insufficiently\r\noccupied. Socialism, you thus see, would often place a premium upon\r\nlaziness and inefficiency.\r\n\r\nSocialism would benefit the shiftless and lazy at the expense of the\r\nthrifty and industrious. Is that a good system to advocate and follow?\r\nWhich of you would be willing to share your hard-won provision for your\r\nown family with another family, the head of which you knew to be lazy,\r\nincapable, and dissipated? What incentive to struggle would remain if\r\nthe results of that struggle were to be taken away from you and given to\r\nothers who sat idly by? What would be the effect upon the United States\r\nof throttling the ambition to achieve? Take the necessity of struggle\r\nout of life, and we should quickly weaken human nature. Civilization\r\nwould decline and national decay quickly follow. True, the competitive\r\nsystem works harshly upon the weak and incompetent. This, however, opens\r\na channel for development of benevolence, kindness, and patience,\r\nwithout which human nature would be exceedingly one-sided and\r\nforbidding. The indigent, unfortunate, and weak will always be a charge\r\nupon the stronger, whether in the family, the municipality, or the\r\nstate. It is folly to think that life can be lived without struggle; and\r\nthat is one of the chief delusions of Socialism which would quickly\r\nimpair our national manhood and endurance. Trouble and pain have their\r\npart in the plan of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist is usually an unfortunate or misled individual. He has\r\nprobably suffered from reverses or unfortunate environment. He has\r\nperhaps been roughly or cruelly handled. Perhaps he cannot get on\r\nsatisfactorily, or his ambitions have been disappointed. He is then in a\r\ncondition of discontent ready to swallow Socialistic—or any\r\nother—sophistries which hold out the delusive promise of relief.\r\n\r\nSocialism attaches too little importance to the fact that men are made\r\nwith an infinite variety of tastes, abilities, and capacities. No two\r\nare precisely alike, and it is utter folly for poor, weak man to\r\nundertake to equalize these differences. All progress in history has\r\nbeen made through struggle and sacrifice; and Socialism, no matter how\r\nbeneficent its intentions, cannot change the inscrutable laws of nature\r\nor humanity. All natural laws have their reverse side. Gravitation,\r\nwhich keeps us firm on our feet so long as we are on solid ground,\r\nknocks us to pieces if we attempt to walk off a housetop or over the\r\nopening of a pit. It is not the natural law, but the attempt to ignore\r\nit, that gives us trouble.\r\n\r\nI most emphatically assert that we cannot get rid of competition, any\r\nmore than we can get rid of the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe American inventor, mechanic, farmer, merchant, and financier, and\r\nthe worker in every profession, are, every one of them, proud,\r\nrespectively, of their skill, knowledge, and ability. Their ambition is\r\nto excel—to produce the most and best. Experience, enterprise, and\r\ncourage create opportune conditions most favorable to the State and\r\nNation and to themselves. Each vies with his fellow man in producing the\r\nbest results, and is always willing to tackle any obstacle—no matter how\r\nformidable—that stands in the way of success. In his whole compendium\r\nand entire makeup, there is no such word as fail. He aids, by his\r\nuntiring and individual energy and effort, in making his country the\r\ngreatest in the whole agricultural, industrial, and financial world. He\r\nreaps the reward of industry and accomplishment, and his home is blessed\r\nwith bounty; and he knows that his children have equal opportunity with\r\nhimself to learn and to achieve.\r\n\r\nShall he be asked to tolerate, or consider, the sacrifice of all these\r\nthings, so dear to him, for Socialism?\r\n\r\nShall he be led to believe in a foreign plan or system of government\r\nthat degrades skill, eliminates acquisition and thrift, and ignores\r\ngenius? I cannot think so!\r\n\r\nThese are the very qualities and attributes that he prizes so highly, as\r\nessential to the prosperity of the home and nation. He knows (or should\r\nknow) that to do so would be to deaden and relinquish those God-given\r\nqualities of heart and brain that have helped to make him and his\r\ncountry what they are to-day.\r\n\r\nHe knows (what the nations of the world concede) that the American\r\npeople are the most prosperous of all on the face of the globe; and that\r\nthis high and commanding position has been attained under existing\r\nconditions, and through the operation of our admirable system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhatever, therefore, may be the pretexts used to make him dissatisfied\r\nwith his lot, his own experience tells him every day that the\r\nConstitution under which he lives is a glorious one, and so implanted in\r\nthe hearts of the American people as to be impregnable against the\r\nassaults of Socialism.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he is appreciative of the fact that it is not in the\r\nnature of things to expect in this world blessings pure and unmixed; but\r\nhe is thankful for the superior good that he enjoys under our beneficent\r\ndemocratic form of government.\r\n\r\nA state of Socialism in the United States would tend to drive all our\r\nmen of superior ability, skill, and power out of the country. The strong\r\nwould quickly seek other fields where the qualities which they possess\r\nwould have a free chance and an open field. They would promptly desert a\r\ncountry that offered nothing better than a dismal dead level, with no\r\nmeans of achievement in sight, and the nation would quickly fall into a\r\nstate of miserable inertia or decay. Our forefathers came to this\r\ncountry to establish religious freedom; they next fought for political\r\nfreedom; afterwards they sacrificed a million lives for race freedom;\r\nand now we, their successors, with such glorious traditions behind us,\r\nmust stand for industrial and social freedom. For, in the final\r\nanalysis, Socialism can stop at nothing short of industrial slavery and\r\npolitical bondage. Great achievements would be impossible under it.\r\n\r\nHaving shown the force and importance of individual initiative and\r\nindependence and the necessity for the spur of competition to bring\r\nabout the best results in human welfare and achievement, I now turn to\r\nthe rather concrete branch of the subject, known as Municipal Ownership.\r\n\r\nNaturally, a proposition involving the placing of the ownership and\r\noperation of our railroads, telegraph lines, plants for supplying light\r\nand surface transportation, and conducting manufactories and business,\r\nis one of such vital concern to all of us as to arouse our keenest\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIt is a part and parcel of the Socialistic plan of government, and, to a\r\nvery great extent, the arguments and illustrations presented in my\r\ntreatment of Socialism, generally, are of direct application to\r\nMunicipal Ownership.\r\n\r\nI would term it the entering wedge of Socialism, adroitly resorted to by\r\nits advocates. These Socialists well know the temper of the American\r\npeople toward their propaganda and wild project, and at the same time\r\nthey recognize the peculiar trait of character disclosed by Americans in\r\ntheir curiosity and liking for anything new. Hence, they grossly\r\nexaggerate the shortcomings and ills that exist in our body politic as\r\nconstituted; and, at the same time, extol, in an extravagant manner, the\r\nsuperior conditions that would follow the taking of a small portion of\r\nthe Socialist’s infallible cure.\r\n\r\nMunicipal Ownership, as far as I have been able to observe, is also a\r\npure and simple political move to secure votes for aspirants for office,\r\nand it is used for this purpose, regardless of any other question. It is\r\none of those planks that we often see inserted by parties in their\r\nplatform, to stand upon, to attract and gather in the votes. So\r\nSocialism has its uses—for them.\r\n\r\nI will admit that there are many economists who have presented a\r\nfriendly side to the Socialistic theories involved, and have prepared\r\nable and extended articles in their endeavor to support or uphold such\r\ntheories (either in whole or in part); and it would be unjust to include\r\nthem in the same category with politicians and Socialists. However, if\r\nthat statesman was only half right who, in speaking of the tariff, said\r\nthat the question was a business one, and that a condition and not a\r\ntheory confronted us, then I feel that I am right in saying that “Public\r\nOwnership” is a practical business question entirely—and not a\r\ntheoretical one.\r\n\r\nThere are so many logical and unanswerable reasons against this\r\nSocialistic proposition that I feel it incumbent upon me to enlarge only\r\nupon the practical ones, that I know more about, than upon those of the\r\ntheoretical group.\r\n\r\nThe experience of years has demonstrated that at the present time all\r\nbusiness enterprises require rare ability and experience, if not genius,\r\nto ensure success.\r\n\r\nGreat financiers and successful men have devoted their lives to the\r\nstudy and practice of their trade and business.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, then, for municipalities to expect such\r\nqualifications from officers whose term of office is for one or two\r\nyears, or during the tenure in office of a political party?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From stereograph. Copyright, 1907, by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y.\r\n  THOMAS F. RYAN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the economy of commerce and its daily conduct and operation, there\r\nare numerous divisions or departments, each one of which can only be\r\nunderstood, appreciated, and conducted by men of special training and\r\nfitness—who have given years of application thereto—and it is only by\r\ntheir watchful care and expert management of each of these divisions\r\nthat a possible success is derived or business made to pay.\r\n\r\nThe smallest neglect, the merest indifference to details, or the\r\ninattention that always accompanies abstraction by something else—taking\r\none’s mind off his business—upsets the whole system, and means waste\r\ninstead of saving economy, loss in place of profit, and inevitable\r\nfailure as the result. That this is true there is not the slightest\r\ndoubt, and would be readily confirmed by the leaders of every industry.\r\n\r\nAnimated by a desire to make the best possible showing, for use at the\r\nnext election, a false economy would be exercised under Municipal\r\nOwnership, and no attention would be paid to obtaining useful new\r\ninventions; and needed improvements and extensions would, likewise, be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, under private ownership, the best professional talent\r\nis employed, at salaries unheard of in public office; and all the latest\r\ninventions and improvements are at once utilized, giving the public\r\nup-to-date service.\r\n\r\nThe active, modern business man, keenly alive to the requirements\r\nnecessary to ensure profit and success, perceives at a glance the evils\r\nand mischievous results that would infect everything carried on under\r\nthis Socialistic plan. And as John Stuart Mill well says: “The mischief\r\nbegins when, instead of calling forth the activity of individuals, the\r\nmunicipality substitutes its own activity for theirs.”\r\n\r\nNo serious attempt has ever been made to show the possibility of\r\nsecuring and retaining, under some rule of municipal civil service, or\r\notherwise, the best men to assume the burden of management and\r\nresponsibility. As already explained, it would be practically impossible\r\nto secure the best men, and no system of civil service has yet been\r\nformulated, intended and able to provide for their retention.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, a fitting illustration is the case of Colonel\r\nWaring, who instituted and maintained the best street-cleaning system we\r\nhave ever seen. His work was simply marvelous, and he made New York City\r\na model of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nNo one ever questioned his ability or integrity; yet, while at the very\r\nzenith of his success, he was asked to resign, and obliged to leave the\r\ncity employment to make room for the choice of a new city\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe defects and fallacies of Municipal Ownership which I have described\r\npermeate all government ownership. Official reports and statistics\r\nfurnish convincing proofs and conclusive evidence of the failure of this\r\nsystem as conducted abroad, and more signal loss and damage—in an\r\nincalculable degree—would surely follow its adoption here. Just in\r\nproportion as our interests and enterprises are the greatest and most\r\nsuccessful, as compared with other nations, would be the immensity of\r\nour depreciation and collapse.\r\n\r\nThe United States is so different from other nations in its political\r\nsystem that this fact alone precludes serious consideration of our\r\nadoption of this imported Socialistic hobby and political heresy. It is\r\nalso a country whose every chapter of growth, progress, and prosperity\r\nis a continuous narrative of individual efforts of its citizens. They,\r\nnaturally, prize individuality as they do independence itself, and have\r\nevery reason to believe that the present system of government is the\r\nbest for them, and that this land of Individualism is no place for\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nImagine New York under Municipal Ownership of our public utilities! We\r\nshould then have fastened upon us a more colossal and more corrupt\r\nTammany than even existed in Tweed’s times. Graft would thrive beyond\r\nall dreams of avarice. Let us take a lesson from England in this\r\nrespect, where public ownership has been tried on a larger scale and\r\nunder more favorable conditions than elsewhere. In a few instances the\r\nrunning of street railways or city lighting plants has been successful,\r\nbut exceptions do not always prove the rule, and the conditions under\r\nwhich these enterprises have been operated there must be taken into\r\nconsideration. English cities are comparatively free of political\r\ncorruption, and are, moreover, often served by men of high character,\r\nwealth, and ability—men having a strong sense of civic duty, who deem it\r\nan honor to give their community efficient service. Unfortunately, we\r\nhave not yet developed a class of this sort in the United States;\r\nperhaps in due time we shall; but, until then, the experiment of\r\nMunicipal Ownership had better be indefinitely postponed. A weak point\r\nof Municipal Ownership has usually been the financial end of the\r\nbusiness concerning which the public has been poorly informed. Many of\r\nthese enterprises in English cities have proved unprofitable. The\r\naccounts have been juggled, and expenses that should be charged against\r\nthe plant were often transferred to city accounts. Not a few of the\r\nEnglish cities have so run into debt as to injure their credit and\r\nimpair the sale of their securities. Already, the British taxpayer is\r\nbeginning to complain about the costliness of these Municipal Ownership\r\nschemes, and a decided reaction against them is setting in. The London\r\nCounty Council has launched heavily into these ventures, many of which\r\nhave proved losing ventures, and some prominent experts have gone so far\r\nas to predict that London will be bankrupt before long, unless present\r\ntendencies are reversed. If Municipal Ownership has failed under the\r\nhighly favorable conditions which exist in England, how can it succeed\r\nhere? Again, the English telegraph system operated by the British\r\nGovernment does not compare with the private systems of the United\r\nStates, either in efficiency or cheapness, and England with its public\r\ntelephones is very far behind the United States in efficiency and cost.\r\nLondon does not begin to have the number of telephones per capita that\r\nNew York can claim. American railroads under private ownership perform\r\nthe best and cheapest service in the world.\r\n\r\nIf any further argument were needed to convince you that the United\r\nStates is no place for Socialism, its root or branches, it may be found\r\nin the radical and quite amusing change of front shown by Major\r\nDalrymple, of Glasgow, upon the occasion of his visit to this country.\r\nHe came here at the request of Major Dunne, of Chicago, and the\r\nMunicipal Ownership League of New York, to aid the forces of Socialism\r\nin their efforts in behalf of Municipal Ownership. He was the great\r\nApostle of that doctrine in Glasgow, and the very man, in their opinion,\r\nto convert our people to that system.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival here, he was greeted with great éclat by the League of\r\nthis city, and gave out an interview in which he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I see no reason why any city in this country should not be able to own\r\nits street railways, and to run them with as much success as we have\r\nachieved at Glasgow. I admit that the proposition is a much larger one\r\nthan the one we had to tackle, but at the bottom it is the same.”\r\n\r\nThis was before he knew our country and its institutions. After an\r\nextended stay here, he prepared for his homeward journey, but before\r\nsailing, he was again interviewed, and to the surprise and discomfiture\r\nof the Socialists, he retracted all that he had said before in favor of\r\nMunicipal Ownership, in the following language:\r\n\r\n“To put street railways, gasworks, telephone companies, etc., under\r\nMunicipal Ownership would be to create a political machine in every\r\nlarge city that would be simply impregnable. These political machines\r\nare already strong enough, with their control of policemen, firemen, and\r\nother office holders.\r\n\r\n“If, in addition to this, they could control the thousands of men\r\nemployed in the great public utility corporations, the political\r\nmachines would have a power that could not be overthrown. I came to this\r\ncountry a believer in public ownership. What I have seen here, and I\r\nhave studied the situation carefully, makes me realize that private\r\nownership, under proper conditions, is far better for the citizens of\r\nAmerican cities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From stereograph.

GATES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York papers aptly called this “The conversion of the Scot”; and\r\nthis blunt and honest admission coming from their own authority, that\r\nMunicipal Ownership in this country was wholly impracticable, stunned\r\nand paralyzed its agitators, and caused many of its adherents to leave\r\nthe ranks of Socialism.\r\n\r\nMr. James Bryce, the worthy newly appointed English Ambassador to this\r\ncountry, pointed out some twenty years ago, in his “American\r\nCommonwealth,” how the then future of the United States sometimes\r\npresented itself to the mind as a struggle between two forces—the one\r\nbeneficent, the other malign; the one striving to speed the nation to a\r\nport of safety before the storm arrives, the other to retard its\r\nprogress, so that the tempest may be upon it before the port is reached.\r\nHe further expressed concern as to whether the progress then discernible\r\ntoward a wiser public opinion and a higher standard of public life would\r\nsucceed in bringing the mass of the people up to a high level, or\r\nwhether the masses would yield to the temptation to abuse their power\r\nand seek violent and vain and useless remedies—like Socialism—for the\r\nevils which would affect us.\r\n\r\nThis able statesman predicted that the question would be decided early\r\nin the present century, and would be evidenced by the condition of\r\nprogress and prosperity brought about by the people in the meantime.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ambassador was recently welcomed to our shores, the answer to\r\nthis question concerning us, asked by him so long ago, was found\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\nIt was spoken clearly and loudly by our teeming products of agriculture\r\nand mining, and echoed in thunder tones by our mammoth shops and\r\nfactories of industry, and it was seen shining in the happy faces of our\r\nbusy and prosperous people.\r\n\r\nUpon the golden page of to-day in our splendid history will stand out\r\nthe assuring fact that this surpassingly successful state of things has\r\nnot blossomed and come forth under the blighting shade of the deadly\r\nUpas tree of Socialism, but that it has all been developed by and\r\nthrough Individualism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me impress upon you that Individualism in the United\r\nStates has stood all tests—especially the crucial tests of time and\r\nexperience—and it points with pride and satisfaction to the great\r\ndevelopments secured for the American people under the bright and\r\nbeneficent rays of our admirable Constitution and Republican form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAnd if the aim of all government is to ensure prosperity to the country,\r\nand happiness to the people it controls, the unrivaled excellence of\r\nIndividualism may fairly be judged by its magnificent results.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdwin Markham, Esq., the Author and Poet, being agreed upon by both\r\nparties to the debate, presided at the meeting.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the above address the chairman addressed the 5,000\r\nassemblage as follows:\r\n\r\n    “LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I hope you have enjoyed listening to Mr.\r\n    Clews’s very able address as much as I have. He swept the entire\r\n    horizon and has left nothing more to be said on his side.”\r\n\r\nMr. Markham then introduced Professor Kirkpatrick, to combat Mr. Clews’s\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\n      GREAT WEALTH AND SOCIAL UNREST.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  An address delivered by Henry Clews at the Thirty-fourth Annual\r\n  Assembly of the Chautauqua Institution at Chautauqua, N. Y., July 29,\r\n  1907.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI think that you will agree with me when I say that there is nothing\r\nmore commendable and that augurs better for the future of the\r\ninstitutions of our country—our great American Republic—than the\r\ninterest shown by all classes in the important sociological questions of\r\nthe day. The general willingness of our citizens to solve the serious\r\nproblems involved by rationally debating them, and allowing careful\r\nconsideration and calm judgment to lead the way to honest conviction, is\r\none of the good signs of the times.\r\n\r\nWe are progressive in spirit as well as in our practical achievements,\r\nand, in many respects, we have set the pace for other nations.\r\n\r\nAt one time, we know, capitalists and leaders of industry too often\r\neither wholly ignored the discontent or appeals of the laboring people\r\nin their employ, or subject to their influence, or, if appreciating the\r\ncauses of their discontent, showed no disposition whatever to right\r\ntheir wrongs, or even to define their own views and position, or make\r\nany attempt to defend their own side of the case.\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude of Capital toward Labor in former times that I may\r\nliken to the Dark Ages. It was, of course, radically wrong and unjust.\r\nThe refusal, or, at least, the unwillingness, of Capital to recognize\r\nthe fact that there are two sides to every case was not only oppressive,\r\nbut often led to costly and destructive strikes, and, doubtless, in a\r\nmeasure, retarded development and progress in industrial and other human\r\naffairs. But now Capital is showing more readiness to meet Labor on the\r\nsame platform of discussion; and in keeping with this opening of the\r\ndoor to fair and full two-sided discussion is the general tendency of\r\nlegislation to improve the condition of the masses, and the Chautauqua\r\nInstitution in holding this Convention to consider the question of\r\nSocial Unrest is entitled to great credit for the performance of a most\r\nlaudable service in the interest of education and progress and the\r\nuplifting of humanity. It is sowing the seeds of future advancement and\r\ngreatness in those directions.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Social Unrest exists, and moreover is very prevalent, not\r\nonly here but throughout the world, cannot be denied. Thus, in Russia,\r\njust emerging from the throes of a deadly and costly war, the spirit of\r\ndiscontent and Nihilism is rampant, and in France the Terrorists are\r\ngaining in numbers and clamoring for their rights, while Austria and\r\nGermany are greatly disturbed by the constant persistence of the violent\r\nand revolutionary Socialists in railing against society and government\r\nas they now exist. In Great Britain, too, the Socialists have stirred\r\nthe people to uneasiness by the loud threats, and rule or ruin alarms,\r\nthat they are sounding.\r\n\r\nWhile this unrest and discontent are especially great in foreign\r\ncountries, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that these exist in the\r\nUnited States—though not in such large proportions as in Europe.\r\nMoreover, they are largely of a different kind and quality.\r\n\r\nBut it is not well for us to give undue recognition to the Socialistic\r\noutcries in this country, for by so doing we might encourage and\r\naggravate a condition that, to my mind, is an equal menace to both\r\nCapital and Labor—the two great living forces of our national life. We\r\nmay increase an evil by magnifying it.\r\n\r\nToo much appreciation and regard cannot, however, possibly be shown to\r\nthat spirit of unrest existing among us, which leads to individual\r\nbetterment and national development, and which is especially\r\ncharacteristic of the American people.\r\n\r\nEver since the blazing torch of civilization threw its bright light upon\r\nthe world, it has been the paramount disposition of man to add to his\r\npossessions and to aspire to higher and better conditions. In this he is\r\ndistinguished from savages and the lower orders of animal life, which\r\nhave no perception of what we call ambition and achievement.\r\n\r\nMan being endowed with a mind, it is through the exercise of his mental\r\nfaculties that he is made restless under unsatisfactory conditions; and\r\ncivilized man is fired with a desire for improvement, and particularly\r\nto improve his own fortunes and position by increasing his possessions,\r\nand acquiring distinction, or reputation in his business. This is well,\r\nso long as it does not degenerate into graft, or the misuse of other\r\npeople’s money.\r\n\r\nIt is this unrest and this aspiration that constitute the great\r\nincentive to human progress, and that have given us our cultivated\r\nfields and teeming harvests, endowed and multiplied our noble edifices\r\nof learning and religion, built our large and splendid cities and homes,\r\nour great bridges and other engineering works, and our vast factories\r\nand other busy hives of industry. This is laudable ambition that\r\nstimulates national development.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, be careful to draw a plain line of demarcation between\r\nthat unrest I have described, and which springs from an appreciation of\r\nthe solidity and soundness of our foundation and aspires to build\r\nthereon so as to realize the highest ideals of perfection and\r\nsuccess—and that misguided or malicious unrest and discontent incited by\r\nSocialism. This is really at enmity with all civilized forms of\r\ngovernment and all measures of advancement in the right direction, and\r\nseeks their overthrow and utter destruction.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of unrest that I have commended, and which I have termed an\r\nAmerican type, is not noisy and clamorous in its nature, and it\r\nmanifests itself mostly through organizations of labor, in demands for\r\nadequate or increased compensation, or the fixing of a stated reasonable\r\nnumber of hours to constitute a day’s work. With these purposes, and the\r\naims of Labor-Unions generally, I want to state that I am in the fullest\r\naccord. The laborer is worthy of his hire, as the Bible says.\r\n\r\nBut it is not from this source that the wail and cry of Social Unrest\r\ncomes. No, “The shallows murmur, while the depths are dumb,” and it is\r\nfrom the other and Socialistic class that we hear the government and its\r\ninstitutions decried, and capital and commerce attacked, and the spirit\r\nof competition and achievement assailed. I say, Down with these\r\nassassins of good government, these assailants of law and order!\r\n\r\nTrue, we see Labor strikes in some places; but these are incidents that\r\nhave not been uncommon at any time in the past, and are not marked or\r\nsignificant enough now to form a particular feature of the prevailing\r\nSocial Unrest. We have not yet reached the Millennium!\r\n\r\nBut whence comes the Socialist’s expression of unrest and discontent,\r\nand what is it based on? It reminds me of Don Quixote, and the fight\r\nagainst a windmill.\r\n\r\nWhat is the sum and substance of the Socialists’ grievance? They see\r\nonly evil in what is really good government, and none are so blind as\r\nthose who will not see.\r\n\r\nThey claim to be dissatisfied with the existing order of things. But\r\nwhat remedies that are not revolutionary do they prescribe for the cure\r\nof existing social and political ills? The fact is that many Socialists\r\nat heart are anarchists!\r\n\r\nIn almost every instance you will find among the rabble at a Socialist\r\nmeeting some honest but mistaken theorists, who plausibly find fault not\r\nonly with the conduct of our government, but with the very form of our\r\ngovernment itself, and picture, under the delusion they cherish, an\r\nutterly impossible Utopia where—\r\n\r\n                     “The people all are blessed\r\n                      And the weary all have rest.”\r\n\r\nThese visionaries are reinforced by pretended reformers and professional\r\nagitators, often of great persuasive powers, who appeal strongly to the\r\npassions and prejudices of the ignorant people of various nationalities\r\nwho are made to imagine that they are still down-trodden. Here, in my\r\nopinion, lies a real menace and danger—that of these people being\r\ncarried away by the power and passion of such appeals, the inflammatory\r\nutterances of reckless demagogues and firebrands. They are the public\r\nenemies we have most need to guard against.\r\n\r\nThe path of safety lies in standing ready to discuss every proposition\r\nwhich they advance, and then refute, with cool reasoning and argument,\r\nthe fallacy and falsity of their position and the destructive doctrines\r\nthey teach.\r\n\r\nIt will also be very noticeable that the people comprising the\r\nSocialistic audiences at such meetings are mostly foreigners who,\r\nseeking better social and political environments, emigrated to America,\r\na large part of them within the past decade or two. As discontented\r\naliens they become as dangerous as the firebrands they listen to, but\r\nthere is no spirit of self-sacrifice among them. Moreover, they are\r\nslaves to what is worst in Socialism and blind followers of a false god!\r\n\r\nThat this peculiar condition of things should exist in this country\r\nseems almost paradoxical. It is something that a patriotic American\r\ncannot tolerate, and mainly an outcome of Russian oppression, imported\r\nby those who have fled from it, and who fail to understand or appreciate\r\nthe new conditions under which they live. We can well understand and\r\nappreciate how, in a country ruled by a despot, whose heel of oppression\r\nand tyranny is ever on the necks of the down-trodden people, the masses,\r\ndesiring some measure of free action and equality, would revolt against\r\nthese conditions, and seek a reorganization of society. They would,\r\nnaturally, look as far away as they could from such a government of\r\ndespotism—the only one they had ever known—to the other extreme—an\r\nimaginary country where the State should own all the land and capital,\r\nemploy all the people and divide everything, share and share alike,\r\namong the community. Such a government will, of course, never exist. It\r\nis simply impossible.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of revolt, which, in that case, may be patriotism,\r\nbecomes ridiculous, and open to the charge of insincerity, when its\r\nworst doctrines are transplanted and cultivated upon American soil by\r\nour foreign population. When it appears here it is really more like\r\nAnarchism than Socialism, and I emphasize this.\r\n\r\nBorn of the spirit of resistance to oppression, with the broadest and\r\nfreest constitution that the world has ever known—a land of freedom and\r\nequality in the best and most liberal sense of the term—it would seem\r\nthat the sincere lover of liberty and equality could ask no better home\r\nthan this democracy of ours—whose glorious flag floats over eighty-four\r\nmillions of prosperous and enlightened people.\r\n\r\nWith further reason, also, must we question the sincerity of the violent\r\ntype of Socialist, who, leaving oppression behind, emigrates to this\r\ncountry, where tyranny and despotism are unknown, and yet continues to\r\necho Socialism’s war-cry of destruction, wrung from his heart by the\r\ncruelty of his old-time oppressors. When he does this he becomes an\r\nenemy of our Republic, unworthy of citizenship.\r\n\r\nHe comes here from a land of want and thraldom to a land of plenty and\r\nfreedom. He may come without name, fame, or property, and he is received\r\nwith open arms. After a brief residence, he is entitled to full\r\ncitizenship, and is then a part of the government, enjoying all the\r\nrights and privileges of the native born. He is a sharer in the equality\r\npossessed by all, the right to share in the government such as the\r\nelectoral franchise and eligibility to public office. He is possessed of\r\nthe civil rights enjoyed by all citizens in the equality of material\r\nconditions—that is, the right to acquire wealth and all that wealth\r\nimplies.\r\n\r\nEvery opportunity for him to achieve success and happiness abounds on\r\nevery hand, and every incentive to industry and accomplishment awaits\r\nhim, and, if he is energetic and skilful, there is nothing to hinder him\r\nfrom becoming prosperous, or, in other words, successful in whatever\r\nvocation in life he may engage. With qualities that commend themselves\r\nto his fellow men, there is no limit to the possibilities of his\r\nachievements, and very soon, as has been very often the case, he may\r\nbecome not only wealthy but a leader of men. If, therefore, he is\r\nsincere, surely he must agree with me that in view of these conditions\r\nthis is no place for the Socialist. He must be an ingrate who would fail\r\nto appreciate the splendid boon.\r\n\r\nDoes it not, indeed, sound like a paradox to hear this cry of Socialism\r\nstill rending the air while every avenue of fortune lies open to\r\neveryone? It is a glaring anomaly of the times, an offence to American\r\ninstitutions, a poor return for our national hospitality. Vague and\r\nillogical as the theories advanced by the doctrinaires of Socialism are,\r\nthere runs throughout all their teachings and preachings bitter and\r\nradical opposition to individual accumulation of wealth and individual\r\ncompetition in industry.\r\n\r\nSocialists would, in other words, fence up the great field of free\r\nopportunity, deaden all incentive or inspiration for great achievement\r\nand not only curtail, but wholly remove the right to compete and excel\r\nand make it impossible to achieve success as the result of individual\r\neffort. They would reduce us all to a barren uniformity.\r\n\r\nThink of this monstrous proposition! Why, the very thing that the\r\nSocialists attack as untenable and wrong in government, namely,\r\nindividual competition, has done more than anything else to make us what\r\nwe are as a nation; has kept alive the precious fires of liberty and\r\nfreedom, and preserved the institutions of our country. Take away the\r\nprogressive spirit of Individualism from the people, and you at once\r\neliminate the American spirit—the love of freedom—of free industry—and\r\nfree and unfettered opportunity—you take away indeed freedom itself!\r\n\r\nThe state of society the Socialists seek to establish might be\r\nbeneficial to a class which, under any conditions, lacks frugality,\r\nthrift and self-reliance; but just where the general mass of humanity\r\nwould be bettered or elevated socially, morally or politically, is a\r\npoint not satisfactorily explained, and never will be.\r\n\r\nIf you render equally accessible to each and every member of the human\r\nfamily the benefits of civilization, all holding “properly in common,”\r\nwhy should a man rack his brain or strain his muscles in producing\r\nsomething which he expects to prove remunerative or beneficial to\r\nhimself in some way, but which under the Socialistic state would\r\ncontribute to the equal financial benefit of all? The highway to\r\ndistinction and opulence would be closed.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the inconsistency of some poor specimens of human\r\nnature, when put to the test of Socialism, I will tell two stories:\r\n\r\nJerry Sullivan had proclaimed himself a Socialist, and was being\r\ninterviewed by his friend, Mike Casey.\r\n\r\n“Jerry, do you believe in dividing up everything with your neighbor?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, and I do that.”\r\n\r\n“If you had two horses (Jerry had none) would you give one to your\r\nneighbor Flanagan?”\r\n\r\n“I’d be only too glad to.”\r\n\r\n“And if you had two automobiles, would you give him one?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, Mike, I would. We should have share and share alike in this\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“And if you had two Angora goats (which Jerry did have) would you give\r\none to Flanagan?”\r\n\r\n“What, give him one of my goats! Not by a jugful! Let Barney Flanagan\r\nbuy his own goats.”\r\n\r\nOne of my millionaire clients, on his return from a trip abroad, called\r\nupon me to pay his respects. In the course of our conversation he said\r\nhe had become a confirmed Socialist. I expressed surprise, and said,\r\n“Then, of course, you are going to divide up all your properly with your\r\nless fortunate associates?” He said, “Oh no, but I want all the other\r\nfellows to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe most commendable object in Socialism is the uplifting of the\r\ndown-trodden and poor, yet that great Commoner and Tribune of the\r\nPeople, William Jennings Bryan, tells us that under Individualism we\r\nhave seen a constant increase in altruism. That the fact that the\r\nindividual can select the object of his benevolence and devote his means\r\nto the causes that appeal to him has given an additional stimulus to his\r\nendeavors. And Mr. Bryan pointedly asks the question: “Would this\r\nstimulus be as great under Socialism?” Let it not be forgotten that by\r\nmeans of present tendencies and existing economic laws the poor are\r\nconstantly growing richer, that is, better off, particularly as\r\nindicated by the savings bank deposits. The common people and the\r\nsavings banks were never before so prosperous as they are now. Labor has\r\nmade great strides, and the uplift in the lower walks of life in all\r\nChristendom during this generation and particularly during the past\r\ntwenty years has been beyond precedent. Give us wise and just\r\nlegislation, and complaints of the inequitable distribution of wealth\r\nwill quickly disappear. Let us put down and keep down the revolutionary\r\nSocialists and Anarchists.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the unrest of a people is prompted by a desire to promote\r\nthe good of the greatest number of their fellow beings it will be\r\nproductive of lasting benefit to all in the long run. But if any\r\ncombination of capitalists, laborers, politicians, or religious bodies,\r\nhas for its aim the particular good of only a certain class or party,\r\nsuch action as they take will be prompted by selfish desire, and will\r\nwork for evil and injustice. The great mass of the people of this\r\ncountry, outside of the big cities, are not allied with either the\r\nmembers of labor unions or the very large capitalists, and the feeling\r\nof discontent is largely bred in cities, where it is magnified by the\r\nprominence given to it by agitators and the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe wage earner in the cities is more or less disheartened by the high\r\nprices of food supplies, the higher rents and the higher rates of\r\ninterest on mortgages, and he argues that his pay has not advanced in\r\nthe same proportion as the price of home necessaries. Mechanics and\r\nother laboring men are receiving higher average wages than ever before,\r\nbut the display of wealth in modern palaces for the rich, and the\r\nabundance of automobile and kindred luxuries among them, have kindled\r\nenvy and whetted their desire for things beyond their means or hopes of\r\nattainment. While no law can change the nature of a man, and while we\r\ncannot expect an ambitious man with an elastic conscience to always\r\nbecome a benefactor, or a labor union leader, filled with hate, to\r\nbecome a saint, I hope that the agitation now existing may lead in time\r\nto a more general observance of the Golden Rule, to do unto others as we\r\nwould they should do unto us.\r\n\r\nI may say here that I believe nine-tenths of the dissatisfaction of the\r\nmasses is based upon mistaken ideas. Few men are capable of judging\r\nimpartially of the rights or the motives which actuate those upon whom\r\nFortune has smiled: Success may be often a matter of luck and\r\nopportunity; but it cannot be denied that judgment, mental force and\r\ncourage are the factors which are bound to insure success.\r\n\r\nI now speak not only of success from a monetary standpoint—for many of\r\nour most useful, intelligent and influential citizens are comparatively\r\npoor—but of all success. Our larger cities are the hotbeds of unrest.\r\nThe older generation, being anxious that their sons shall have more, and\r\nknow more, than themselves, and enjoy the good things in life which they\r\nhave desired but have not been able to obtain, now try to give their\r\nchildren a liberal education and fit them for what they consider more\r\ncongenial or higher-class occupations than their own.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this is that the younger men, when their education is\r\ncompleted, drift into the cities, where they think they have a better\r\nchance of getting on in life. It is the same with farmers, laborers and\r\nmechanics. Their children desire to rise above their early environments,\r\nand wish to occupy positions where they can use their brains rather than\r\ntheir hands. Hence the many deserted farms in New England and in the\r\nState of New York, for poor soil is not sufficient cause for their\r\ndesertion. It can be made good by fertilizers, and where there’s a will\r\nthere’s a way.\r\n\r\nThis discontent is producing a superfluity of clerks and other brain\r\nworkers, who think work with the head more genteel than work with the\r\nhands, and a great shortage of farm workers that are needed to develop\r\nour agricultural resources. Even the children of the most ignorant\r\nforeigners are imbued with this ambition before they are able to speak\r\nour language. Too many despise honest labor and want to live by their\r\nwits. So we have a vast host of surplus politicians, office-seekers,\r\npromoters, brokers, lawyers, clerks, canvassers and drones.\r\n\r\nIn olden days the young were willing to follow in the footsteps of the\r\nold, and begin life where their fathers began. Now they expect to begin\r\nwhere their fathers leave off, and are dissatisfied and disappointed if\r\nthey find that they have to start from the foot of the ladder.\r\n\r\nWhat we most need in this country to promote and popularize farm and\r\nvillage life, and check the general tendency of both young men and young\r\nwomen to drift to the large cities, is a change in our educational\r\nsystem. We should establish trade schools everywhere to teach the trades\r\nand practical sciences, and so make country-bred people proficient in\r\noccupations that they could follow on the farm, and in village as well\r\nas town life. This knowledge would induce them to stay where they were\r\nborn, instead of rushing off to make or mar their fortunes in the\r\novercrowded cities where many come to grief. Thus the congestion of\r\npopulation in the cities would be relieved, and the country generally\r\nwould be able to retain the men and women it needs for its industries\r\nthat are now held in check by an insufficiency of labor. In this way we\r\nmight gain millions of good mechanics and other useful workmen where\r\nthey are most needed, and reduce the number of the inefficient and\r\nunemployed in the cities, to say nothing of the chronic idlers and the\r\nsporting, gambling and criminal classes. Men instructed for the\r\nprofessions would of course still study in the colleges, but the masses\r\nhave no use to which they can put the higher education of even the high\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of well-meaning theorists engaged in so-called Social\r\nreform who are largely responsible for many things that add to the\r\nunrest in the poorer sections of our cities. Far be it from me to\r\ncriticize anyone who has the desire to better the condition of his less\r\nfortunate brothers, but the work of many of these reformers reminds me\r\nof the man who threw a panful of kerosene on a small fire with the idea\r\nof putting out the flames. To be a true Social reformer a man must be\r\nwell informed on conditions which obtain on all sides of life. A rich\r\nman may have acquired wealth by miserly habits, but if he has not been\r\ndishonest he is entitled to his savings, and no law can compel him to\r\ndivide with the poor man who has been profligate in the use of his\r\nearnings. The thousands of immigrants who arrive at our ports each week\r\nare, for the most part, poor and ignorant. The greater number of them\r\nremain in our cities and add to the congestion and widespread poverty of\r\nthe cities. But these same immigrants are willing to work, and in a year\r\nor two, instead of being a charge upon the community, have savings bank\r\naccounts of their own. However, they are ripe for the reception of the\r\ngospel of unrest, as they have lived hitherto in places where the poor\r\nare always poor, with no lookout for improvement, and willingly listen\r\nto the agitator and prophet of discontent. Mr. Roosevelt has said and\r\ndone things in the last four years which have shaken our land. Many\r\ninvestors have thought that he had gone too far in his insistence that\r\nthe law should be rigidly enforced, as they, innocent holders of\r\nsecurities, had been made to suffer loss by the depression in prices.\r\nWhile it is hard that such losses should have been incurred, it is no\r\nfault of the President, and his action, in the long run, is to be of\r\nuntold value to our national and individual prosperity. If his actions\r\nwill insure the fulfillment of the law by the magnates in power in our\r\nrailroads and corporations, the little man will be on a par with the big\r\nman, and all investments will be on a safer basis, and the dark secrets\r\nof the manipulator will give place to the open publication of rates and\r\nearnings so that a stockholder will know where he stands and what his\r\ncompany is doing.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster, as far back as 1842, found that the spirit of unrest was\r\nin the air as it is now. In an address in that year he said:\r\n\r\n“There are persons who constantly clamor. They complain of oppression,\r\nspeculation and the pernicious influence of accumulated wealth. They cry\r\nout loudly against all banks and corporations and all means by which\r\nsmall capitals become united in order to produce important and\r\nbeneficial results. They carry on mad hostility against all established\r\ninstitutions. They would choke the fountain of industry, and dry all the\r\nstreams. In a country of unbounded liberty they clamor against\r\noppression. In a country of perfect equality they would move heaven and\r\nearth against privilege and monopoly. In a country where property is\r\nmore evenly divided than anywhere else they rend the air shouting\r\nagrarian doctrines. In a country where the wages of labor are high\r\nbeyond parallel, they would teach the laborer that he is but an\r\noppressed slave.”\r\n\r\nI will here deviate to another division of the subject.\r\n\r\nConsiderable uneasiness and unrest have been evinced not only by the\r\nSocialists, but by many others, as to whether great individual or\r\ncorporate wealth—in other words, capital—is inimical and hostile to the\r\npublic welfare and a menace to our institutions.\r\n\r\nI think that it can be clearly shown that this anxiety and unrest are\r\nwithout any good foundation. There is nothing in fact to justify this\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\nIn our own country especially, where individual opportunities are\r\npractically limitless and where thought and effort are exerted to the\r\nutmost straining point, most fruitful, indeed, has been the result. We\r\nhave seen that the making of large fortunes coincidently with great\r\ngeneral prosperity, that is, by those doing a profitable business on a\r\nlarge scale, is an inevitable economic result.\r\n\r\nThe past forty-five years in the United States embrace a new era of\r\nwealth—an era in which the accumulation of vast amounts of money, or its\r\nequivalent, in individual and corporate hands, has accompanied the most\r\nmarvelous national growth and prosperity in all history.\r\n\r\nNew conditions have arisen, and new methods have had to be employed,\r\nwhile new men, equipped with new ideas, have not been found wanting to\r\nmeet all requirements, and to keep step with the march of progress on\r\nboth land and sea. Unlike the people of some of the older countries,\r\nwhere, as in Russia, they distrust their government, Americans do not\r\nhoard their wealth. They employ it. They have nothing to hoard it for.\r\nTheir quickly acquired fortunes are generally lavishly disbursed, both\r\nin their style of living and their investments. With much of the money\r\nthey put into circulation, railroads are built and extended, mammoth\r\nfactories are constructed, labor is employed on a larger scale than\r\nbefore, more farms are cultivated, and more crops are moved and\r\nexported. Through all the arteries of trade and commerce the wealth thus\r\nemployed flows and adds to the growth and prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nKeeping the wheels of commerce moving, by supplying the demands of the\r\nfinancial, mercantile, manufacturing and agricultural world with the\r\n“sinews of war,” in the up-to-date American way, instead of merely\r\ngathering wealth and hiding it away, has been to my mind one great\r\nsecret of our unprecedented national advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES M. SCHWAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to demonstrate just how important an influence\r\nthis practice of keeping wealth actively in use has played in helping to\r\nbring about and preserve the generally progressive and prosperous\r\ncondition of affairs, there is evidence enough to refute much that has\r\nbeen said against the possession of great wealth, and also to show that\r\nthe hostile or critical attitude of the press and the people toward it\r\nis unjust, and should be derided instead of being popular with the\r\nmasses, as it is. The assistance which Americans of great wealth have\r\ngiven the nation, in the founding and preservation of institutions for\r\nthe public benefit and in many other ways, has never been sufficiently\r\nappreciated or acknowledged.\r\n\r\nWealth in good hands serves good purposes. The richest men of the\r\nThirteen Colonies in the American Revolution were among the most active\r\nand self-sacrificing of American patriots. They included George\r\nWashington, John Adams, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison\r\nand Robert Morris, whose names are imperishable on our national roll of\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nIn that glorious struggle for freedom, these wealthy patriots performed\r\na leading and arduous part, and aided largely in effecting that grand\r\nresult—the establishment of this great republic, the United States of\r\nAmerica, under the best and freest Constitution in the world.\r\n\r\nPassing onward from that memorable time, we come to that of the\r\nRebellion, when Secession reared its aggressive head, and the very life\r\nof our institutions was in extreme jeopardy. In the early part of the\r\ngreat Civil War—when the Government, friendless abroad, knew not which\r\nway to turn for the financial aid that it so sorely needed to defend\r\nitself and prosecute the war—history will recall that the great wealth\r\nof private individuals proved not a menace, but a blessing and a godsend\r\nto the Nation. These served their country well by coming forward with\r\ntheir wealth and buying United States bonds in large amounts when the\r\nrisk was hazardous. By so doing they rendered patriotic public service\r\nthat should make even the Socialists hesitate before condemning great\r\nindividual wealth as dangerous to the national welfare.\r\n\r\nI might in illustration of what I say enumerate instances almost without\r\nnumber where, from the rock-ribbed coast of Maine to the Golden Gate of\r\nCalifornia, under the beneficent rays of great gifts of the wealthy the\r\nseeds of education have been sown broadcast and have grown into grand\r\nand telling factors in shaping the character of the rising generation of\r\nAmerican manhood and the destiny of this great country.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the hostility, or unrest, concerning great individual\r\nwealth, and large corporate capital, we are at times confronted by the\r\nbold assertion, made by extremists, that some limit should be set to the\r\namount of property an individual may own. The impracticability and\r\ninadvisability of any such measure are at once apparent. You might as\r\nwell try to limit the capacity or energy of an individual. When you\r\nprevent an individual from accumulating you at once discourage his\r\nproductiveness. This is an axiom beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nAs regards great corporate capital, I must admit that there has been in\r\nmany instances, in the past, good cause for much of the unrest and\r\ndissatisfaction manifested by the people.\r\n\r\nToward competitors large corporations have too often been unscrupulous,\r\njust as the railways were in giving rebates to control the heavy\r\ntraffic. These illegal and reprehensible methods were pursued far too\r\nlong, not only causing immense personal and commercial loss and injury,\r\nbut shaking the confidence of the public in the large corporations\r\ncalled Trusts. These offences can, however, under our new laws, hardly\r\nbe repeated in the future.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust law, the Elkins\r\nAnti-Rebate law and other and later restraining statutes, condign\r\npunishment will, doubtless, be dealt out to offenders, and a rigid\r\nenforcement of these laws, and their necessary amendments, will be\r\nsufficient to regulate corporate bodies and stand as an ægis of\r\nprotection for the nation.\r\n\r\nIn this very active period of business reform overcapitalization is an\r\nevil that must be classed with rebates, railroad discrimination, and\r\nother corporate abuses. This also applies almost equally to both the\r\nindustrial and railroad systems. However much this evil may have been\r\nregarded and thought inevitable in the past, owing to peculiar and lax\r\nconditions in the pioneer days of railroads and industrial upbuilding,\r\nit is intolerable now, and should be made impossible in the future.\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that a great deal of the public unrest\r\nhas proceeded from this source. But, with the stoppage of the evil, it\r\nought to subside.\r\n\r\nOverproduction of any kind is a detriment to trade and leads first to\r\nextravagance and then to disaster; overfeeding produces disease;\r\novertraining of an athlete weakens him and causes his defeat; overstudy\r\nracks the nerves of the student and unfits him for usefulness. Overwork\r\nkills man and beast, and ruins even our locomotives and machinery. Too\r\nmuch rain, too much wind, and too much sunshine spoil our crops; too\r\nmuch confidence or too much caution prevents a business man from\r\nachieving success. There is a happy medium in all things which produces\r\ngood results and promotes success. Under our modern system of financing\r\nour railroads and industrial corporations overcapitalization has in many\r\ninstances run riot and produced an overplus of undigested securities.\r\nThis system of financing will surely lead to disaster if not curbed and\r\nconducted in a rational manner. If a company needs additional funds for\r\nlegitimate purposes, such capital is a necessity which stockholders will\r\nwillingly provide; but the managers of corporations should be compelled\r\nto state exactly and definitely for what purpose such funds are needed,\r\nand should also be compelled to make a clear and definite report.\r\n\r\nCentralization of power in the hands of an able executive is a good idea\r\nif he prove worthy of the trust his colleagues confide in him, but, on\r\nthe other hand, makes him a master, and them slaves, if he be\r\nunscrupulous and crafty.\r\n\r\nHappily, the days of overcapitalization are seemingly over, and an\r\naroused public opinion will, no doubt, be expressed in whatever\r\nprohibitive laws are necessary, if those already enacted prove\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nIn, at least, some instances the existing laws seem inadequate. It is\r\nlikewise due to the sound corporations of the country, as well as to the\r\npublic, that something further should be provided to overcome the\r\nfeeling of suspicion toward them, and to keep the people informed as to\r\ntheir existing methods and the true condition of their affairs.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for corporation wrongdoing is found in publicity! This\r\npublicity is the great need of the present and the future, and the\r\npublic should demand it. It is a lamp that we should always keep\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nIn a recent address delivered by me before the Wharton School of Finance\r\nof the University of Pennsylvania, I urged that the New York\r\nLegislature, as well as the Legislatures of the other States, should\r\nrespond to the popular agitation for this publicity by passing laws\r\nrequiring all corporations to make at least semi-annual reports of their\r\ncondition, certified to by registered public accountants, with power\r\ninvested in the State superintendents to order special examinations by\r\nsuch accountants at any time when deemed necessary, that is, whenever\r\nany of them were suspected of being unsound or irregular in their\r\nbusiness methods.\r\n\r\nThe question now to decide is what remedies can best be adopted to\r\nprevent a repetition of stock-watering. My plan is for the Government to\r\nappoint a salaried director in each of the interstate roads, this\r\ndirector to be on the executive committee also. His duty should be to\r\nact as a watchdog, and he should be required to report to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission all crooked acts or suspicions of any; besides which\r\nthe interstate roads should be compelled by law to issue sworn\r\nstatements of their exact condition semi-annually. Officials of railroad\r\ncompanies found guilty of any illegal acts whatsoever should be punished\r\nby imprisonment. Money penalties are of no use in stopping wrongs of\r\nwealthy corporations.\r\n\r\nRailroad discriminations and other abuses were incident and owing to our\r\nextraordinary development during the last half century, and especially\r\nto the striking failure of our Legislatures to keep pace with national\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly look into a few of the causes which were responsible for\r\nthis railway abuse. Both before and after our recent Civil War this\r\ncountry was greatly in need of more railway transportation than it had,\r\nand national development was impossible without it. We had millions of\r\nsquare miles of territory rich in natural resources, but totally\r\nundeveloped and awaiting population, capital and transportation. Of\r\ncourse transportation had to be provided before either population or\r\ncapital could venture with any freedom into the Great West. In those\r\ndays it was vastly more difficult to raise $1,000,000 for a new railroad\r\nenterprise than it was to procure $100,000,000 in more recent times. The\r\npublic was not accustomed to such ventures, and the country did not then\r\ncontain the large number of wealthy men who must now be depended upon to\r\nback such great enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn those days railroads required relatively large capital; the risks\r\nwere new and great, and some means of securing large profits had to be\r\ndevised in order to tempt men of means to venture into such enterprises,\r\nwhich from their very nature involved a long wait for profit. Our\r\nearliest railroad builders were men of unbounded faith in the future,\r\nand they well knew that many years of patience and outlay would be\r\nnecessary before such enterprises could become profitable. It is almost\r\naxiomatic to say that in this country our railroads have been the\r\nprincipal factors in national progress. In the United States, railroads\r\nwere called upon to develop both population and traffic. In Europe,\r\npopulation and traffic were already in existence and simply awaited the\r\nrailroad. When railroad building first began, England was already a\r\nclosely settled country; and it was only necessary to construct the\r\nlines to obtain profitable traffic at once. No special inducements were\r\nnecessary for the attraction of capital, and no preliminary period of\r\nwaiting or loss was required to develop traffic. It was vastly different\r\nhere; railroads had to be built across thousands of miles of new\r\ncountry, frequently over apparently insurmountable mountains where\r\nneither traffic nor population existed; and their builders, men of\r\nmonumental ability and enterprise, knew full well that a generation must\r\npass before such enterprises could be considered profitable and solid\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions what inducements could be offered to overcome such\r\noverwhelming obstacles? While government aid was eagerly sought, it was\r\nrestricted mainly to the Pacific roads where political reasons, such as\r\nunification of new territory, justified government support. Another form\r\nof national aid was the giving of large land grants to railroad\r\ncorporations as a stimulus to the settlement of new territory and the\r\nbuilding of roads adjacent thereto. Even those helps were insufficient.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the treasures of the Great West offered irresistible\r\nattractions to new enterprise and settlement. The demand for more\r\nrailroads was insistent; then came the devices of stock-watering and\r\novercapitalization as inducements to new capital. Roads were often built\r\nentirely on bonds; and stock, having little or no value except for\r\nvoting, was given away as a bonus with the bonds, or used for various\r\npurposes, often in speculation, and such stock frequently found its way\r\nback to the original promoters at bargain if not waste-paper prices.\r\nThis era of speculative railroad building was naturally accompanied by\r\nall sorts of illegitimate operations; overcapitalization bearing a\r\nleading part. No one would now dare think of resorting to such practices\r\nas were common in those pioneer days. They were utterly indefensible,\r\nand yet as an expedient they served their purposes in raising much of\r\nthe capital with which to develop our early railroad systems.\r\n\r\nOur great railroad builders were fully entitled to great profits, since\r\ntheir boldness and skill developed the finest railroad systems the world\r\nhas ever seen, and without them the United States would never have\r\nobtained its present magnificent position and prosperity. We must admit\r\ntheir methods were open to serious criticism, and would not be tolerated\r\nin these days of improved business standards. Nevertheless, they were\r\nthe methods of the day, and must be judged as such. I do not wish to be\r\nunderstood as defending or apologizing for overcapitalization, for I\r\nconsider it an economic evil of the most dangerous character, and its\r\npenalties—political as well as economic—cannot be averted.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the great wave of grangerism and\r\nanti-railroad agitation which swept this country in the ‘80s was a\r\ndirect revulsion of popular feeling against the burdens of\r\novercapitalization and their tax upon traffic. These were the political\r\nresults of such abuses. The economic consequences which\r\nfollowed—somewhat late to be sure—were witnessed in the reconstruction\r\nperiod that followed the panic of 1873, when vast millions of railroad\r\ncapital were literally wiped out by the reorganization of railway\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nTo-day most of our railroads are comparatively free of\r\novercapitalization, both because much of the water has been eliminated\r\nby reorganizations, and because the increased value of terminals and\r\nother properties, as well as the large improvements that were paid for\r\nout of earnings, have increased the intrinsic value of shares which at\r\none time may have been practically valueless. This process of accretion\r\nhas been going on for many years, so that now there is comparatively\r\nlittle difference between intrinsic and market values. Of course, some\r\nrecent striking departures from sound railroad financing can be cited;\r\nbut I am speaking in broad terms, and have no hesitation whatever in\r\nasserting that American railroad investments are now sounder financially\r\nthan any similar class of securities in the world, and this\r\nnotwithstanding that railway companies are compelled to borrow enormous\r\nsums in order to meet the demands of a wonderfully expanding traffic.\r\n\r\nA comparison greatly in our favor could be made with British railroads\r\nwhich have for years been inflating their shares by a policy of charging\r\nimprovements to capital account; the American system being to charge\r\nsuch items against earnings. The result is that British railroad shares,\r\nwhich were once held up to us as models of soundness and honest\r\ncapitalization, are now seriously threatened with an excess of water;\r\nand unless the present policy is changed, English stockholders will soon\r\nbe discarding their home favorites for the bonds and stocks of more\r\nsoundly managed American railroads.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt considerably upon the overcapitalization of our railroads.\r\nNow a word about overcapitalization in another direction, where it is a\r\nvastly more serious affair. While we now have little to fear from\r\novercapitalization of railroads, an inflation has taken place in our\r\nindustrials of the most extravagant character, and this is one of the\r\nmost serious menaces to our industrial and financial future. A feature\r\nof our national development which has attracted world-wide attention\r\nduring the last ten years has been the consolidation of nearly all our\r\ngreat industries into a few “Trusts.” This era of consolidation, or\r\n“Trust-making,” must be classed as an industrial revolution of the\r\nhighest import, containing tremendous possibilities for both good and\r\nevil. Within a few short years a large proportion of our industries were\r\ncombined or turned into Trusts, and securities issued in exchange\r\naggregating about $6,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf course, many of the objects of these combinations were perfectly\r\nlegitimate. The seeking of better and more economic methods of\r\nproduction and distribution was eminently proper, but the grasping for\r\nmonopoly was not legitimate, and has proved more largely responsible for\r\nthe political and social unrest of the times than any other single\r\ncause. Nothing has done more to stimulate Socialism than this\r\nunwholesome tendency toward monopoly and excessive centralization. On\r\nthis feature, however, it is not my intention to dwell further; I must\r\neven entirely pass over the overcapitalization of public franchises as a\r\nsubject of sufficient importance to demand special treatment.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, however, I feel safe in saying that there is\r\npractically no more reason for unrest on the part of the business\r\ncommunity or the people of the nation, on account of the large\r\naggregation of capital represented by Trusts, than from equally large\r\nsums in the hands of individuals; for both are equally controlled by law\r\nand influenced by public opinion, and public opinion is often more\r\npowerful than law in righting wrong. Moreover, public opinion makes the\r\nlaws. As the Latin aphorism says, The People’s voice is the Voice of\r\nGod!\r\n\r\nI take decided issue with a certain distinguished gentleman from\r\nMaryland, that the existing unrest has been brought about by the\r\nnational administration at Washington, and by the Chief Executive of our\r\ncountry, and challenge the truth of this assertion. It is both a\r\nsurprising and ridiculous accusation. The leading men of thought—not\r\nonly in the United States, but all over the world—agree that if, after\r\nthe startling exposures of the life insurance and railroad abuses,\r\nPresident Roosevelt had not taken the sturdy and bold stand that he did,\r\nthe confidence of the public would not only have been severely shaken,\r\nbut would have been well-nigh uprooted; and such a general spirit of\r\nunrest would have followed as to be truly alarming in its nature.\r\n\r\nAs it was, his level-headed and courageous course was timely and almost\r\nprovidential, and instead of being the subject of adverse criticism, he\r\nis entitled to the highest praise from all. Apart from some politicians\r\nand a few others, we are indeed all paying him this deserved tribute. He\r\nhas often shown us that he possesses the courage of his convictions. In\r\nconclusion, while we doubtless all agree that the existing social\r\nunrest, anxiety and prejudice are to be deplored, may we not also unite\r\nin the hope that, under the educating influence of a full discussion of\r\nthe economic questions of the hour, and with the enforcement of the laws\r\nin the hands of an honest and courageous executive, the way to\r\nbetterment will be thoroughly paved? It is a patriotic duty to endeavor\r\nto lessen popular discontent and promote social and political peace and\r\nharmony, and substitute public confidence for unrest and the violent\r\nagitation of Socialism, and so enhance the manifold blessings we enjoy\r\nas American citizens, yes, as citizens of the foremost nation of the\r\nworld, with a future even grander than its past, a country where Nature\r\nis everywhere lavish of her abundance, and freedom and independence are\r\nour birthright. Beholding then, my friends, this grand spectacle of\r\nnational progress and achievement even as it appears to us at this day,\r\nit certainly needs no prophetic tongue to foretell with confidence and\r\nabsolute verity that to the true and ardent patriot and ambitious\r\nAmerican, in fact, to every man inspired with lofty ideals and imbued\r\nwith a spirit and desire for improvement and the perfection of\r\ndemocratic government, the social and political vista of our country’s\r\nfuture will disclose a picture of prosperity and contentment that will\r\nprove a glorious inheritance to the coming generations of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From stereograph.

This was reflected in what I may call a slow panic, a\r\nheavy and prolonged decline on the Stock Exchange under a continuous\r\nflood of liquidation by both investors and speculators.\r\n\r\nThis crisis had been brewing for a long time, and we had a violent\r\nintimation of the dangerous and disturbing elements in the financial\r\nsituation last spring, culminating in the collapse of the stock market\r\nin March. But it was not until a United States Court at Chicago\r\ninflicted a fine of $29,240,000 on the Standard Oil Company, of Indiana,\r\nthat investors, and the large capitalists of Wall Street, including\r\nStandard Oilers, took alarm. Then the trouble became acute.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street speculative multi-millionaires in particular felt the\r\nshoe pinch very sharply. They had been trying hard to engineer a bull\r\nmovement in stocks, for they were very heavily loaded with them. They\r\nhad, however, met with indifferent success, for the outside public was\r\nout of the market and refused to come in. This huge and unprecedented\r\nfine, these leaders of the bull movement saw, was a disconcerting and\r\nstaggering blow at the property of corporations, and consequently at the\r\nstocks of corporations. It amounted, if enforced, to confiscation, and\r\nthey, as large speculators, like the rich and moderately rich investing\r\nclass, reasoned that if the Standard Oil Company of Indiana could be\r\nfined and have its property confiscated in this way, other corporations\r\nwould be liable to the same fate. They also saw that small investors and\r\npeople generally would think and argue as they themselves did, and that\r\ntheir consequent distrust would lead to a heavy decline in prices under\r\nheavy liquidation, through fear or necessity.\r\n\r\nSo they reversed their tactics. In other words, they decided to run,\r\nand, being a little lame, they started early. Instead of continuing\r\ntheir bull movement in stocks, they at once withdrew their support from\r\nthe market and began to liquidate themselves, for self-protection. The\r\nrank and file of the bulls, seeing that stocks were going down with a\r\nrush from this and other sources, were quick to do likewise, as if they\r\nthought the devil would take the hindmost, while the bears helped the\r\nmarket’s descent by an unopposed and vigorous hammering. The bull\r\nleaders had abandoned it to its fate, and the banking interests were not\r\nwilling to stand in the gap.\r\n\r\nThe best and highest-priced stocks suffered the heaviest decline, and\r\nfor a fortnight there was an outpouring of stocks and a downpouring of\r\nprices that finally carried nearly all of these below the lowest of\r\nMarch. Wall Street trembled in its boots.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANTHONY N. BRADY.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decline was accelerated by the unusual scarcity of money on time,\r\nand the advancing rates for it, which undermined confidence in the\r\nfuture of the money market, and in the ability of many corporations in\r\nurgent need of money to borrow on their collaterals, or obtain\r\ndiscounts. Fears on this score had very recently been justified by the\r\nfailure of a large iron and construction company in New York City, and\r\nwhen it was followed by a receivership for the Pope Manufacturing\r\nCompany, the rush to sell stocks, and the fresh break in prices, added\r\nto the previous demoralization. The bears held high carnival, for their\r\nharvest was abundant enough to realize their dreams of avarice.\r\n\r\nIt was feared that this failure might prove the beginning of a long line\r\nof similar failures, and there were many gloomy forebodings as to what\r\nwould come next, either in the way of failures or State or Federal\r\naction against railway or industrial corporations, which would, by\r\ndamaging their credit, lower the value of their stocks, and possibly\r\nimperil future dividends. We too often fear the things we think instead\r\nof the things that are.\r\n\r\nThrough all this turmoil and disorder the want of money by many large\r\ncorporations and the difficulty of borrowing it was always an uppermost\r\ntopic. It touched their weakest spot, and showed the insufficiency of\r\ntheir working capital. They had large assets in plant and materials, but\r\ncomparatively little cash to carry on their large and increasing\r\nbusiness. This made them dependent on the banks; and when the decline in\r\nstocks and bonds caused distrust that led to a curtailment or refusal of\r\ncredits by the banks, they had nothing to fall back upon of their own.\r\nThey were between the Devil and the deep sea.\r\n\r\nThis want of a sufficiency of liquid assets is a common shortcoming\r\namong our corporations, both large and small, and therefore a great\r\nelement of weakness, especially in periods of distrust, and should be\r\nremedied as far as possible in the future. It is better to do less\r\nbusiness on a safe basis than could be done by extensive borrowing, with\r\nthe hazard of failure in some unlooked-for crisis or time of depression.\r\nThe greed of gain should be tempered by the wise admonition to make\r\nhaste slowly. But unfortunately most people are in a hurry, and want to\r\nmake short cuts to success.\r\n\r\nThe August crisis, like all panics, was brought about and aggravated\r\nmore by fears of impending trouble and false rumors than by actual\r\noccurrences. Sentiment often sways as much as facts, and the public had\r\nbecome extremely sensitive to unfavorable news and constructions\r\nregarding the situation, and comparatively blind and deaf to its\r\nfavorable features. All this was ammunition for the bears on the Stock\r\nExchange, and they made the most of it by steadily and relentlessly\r\nhammering stocks down, so increasing the depression caused by the\r\nliquidation of both speculators and investors, and the loss of\r\nconfidence in values. But, like Oliver Twist, the bears still asked for\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThis want of confidence was mainly due to exaggerated apprehensions of\r\nthe effect upon railway and industrial corporations and their stocks of\r\nthe Government investigations and prosecutions, and the hasty action of\r\nthe States against the railways in cutting down their rates. Much of\r\nthis State legislation is too restrictive, and will probably be\r\nmodified, or rescinded, after a trial.\r\n\r\nIt was argued that there was no telling where and when the so-called\r\ncrusade against the railways and the Trusts would stop, or what the\r\nfinal result would be. The bears and the alarmists were equally loud and\r\nexcited in pointing to the twenty-nine-million fine as a sign of what,\r\nin varying degrees and amounts, might happen to other corporations, and\r\nbring ruin to many of them. Thus a merely unsettling influence was\r\nmagnified into a formidable element of national disaster. As prophets of\r\ndisaster, the bears outdid each other, regardless of their friends, the\r\nbulls.\r\n\r\nThe threats and aggressive attitude of some of the Government’s law\r\nofficers alarmed many as much as their allegations against the\r\ncorporations they prosecuted did, and they feared that irreparable harm\r\nto those corporations, and their business, would be done before their\r\ncases were finally decided on appeal, and that their stocks and bonds\r\nwould suffer accordingly, with, it might be, interest and dividends\r\nsuspended. Thus they borrowed a large amount of trouble.\r\n\r\nWith these feelings uppermost in the public mind, or at least\r\ninfluencing investors, it was not surprising that such a fever of\r\ndistrust prevailed on every stock exchange in the United States, and\r\nthat sympathetically and temporarily it somewhat affected the London\r\nStock Exchange and every bourse on the European Continent. The situation\r\nhad begun to look almost hopeless before reason began to take the place\r\nof hysteria among most investors and speculators. Then the\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of stocks prompted investment buying, and the\r\ngreat scare, after two weeks of storm and stress, gradually passed into\r\nhistory, while prices, with occasional setbacks, responded to the change\r\nof sentiment by slow but general recovery. But whether this will be\r\nfollowed by a relapse or not remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension excited among investors and speculators in stocks by\r\nthat $29,240,000 fine against the Standard Oil Company of Indiana did an\r\nimmense amount of harm through the enormous losses to which it led. In\r\ncombination with the prosecution of the Southern Railway by Southern\r\nStates, involving the conflict between North Carolina and Alabama and\r\nthe United States Courts, that extravagant fine, so suggestive of _opera\r\nbouffe_, was the immediate cause of the heavy liquidation that produced\r\nthis August crisis and turned the New York stock market into a storm\r\ncenter. Although there was no probability or even possibility of this\r\nfine ever being collected from a million-dollar corporation, even if\r\naffirmed on appeal, public sentiment was about as much disturbed as if\r\nit were ultimately collectible. By creating, although without sufficient\r\nreason, fear of confiscation, it led to those enormous sales and\r\nsacrifices of stocks by investors, as well as by speculators, and the\r\nvirtual panic that lasted those two long and memorable weeks.\r\n\r\nThe innocent thus suffered with the guilty, and the evil effect of such\r\na fine was clearly demonstrated by a very severe and disastrous object\r\nlesson. The true remedy for rebating and other wilful violations of law\r\nis not to be found in the infliction of heavy penalties on the guilty\r\ncorporations, but on the responsible and guilty officers of those\r\ncorporations, and not alone by fine but by imprisonment. Heavy fines\r\ninflicted on corporations fall finally on their stockholders, through a\r\ncorresponding loss of dividend-paying power, and the lowering of market\r\nprices for their stocks. The proper remedy is punishment behind iron\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nAs the stockholders are in no way responsible for delinquencies in\r\nmanagement, it is unjust to make them suffer the consequences of these.\r\nIt should, therefore, be the future policy of both the Federal\r\nGovernment and the States to punish corporations for illegal practices\r\nby criminal proceedings against those in their employ who are found to\r\nbe responsible for them. Thus punishments will be confined to the\r\nguilty, and confidence will be restored among investors, for such\r\nprosecutions would in no way tend to depreciate the value of the stocks\r\nand bonds of the corporations concerned, but on the contrary they would\r\ntend to enhance their value by promoting honest management. This is a\r\npivotal point to be kept constantly in view. Backsliders would be the\r\nonly sufferers.\r\n\r\nThe collapse in Wall Street stocks was, however, not so much due to the\r\ntrust prosecutions, the Southern States Railway legislation, the\r\ntwenty-nine-million fine, and the avowed policy of President Roosevelt’s\r\nadministration, as to the general condition of monetary affairs, and the\r\ncondition of the stock market itself, although the causes enumerated\r\nstarted the August collapse. The outside public had for a long time been\r\nholding aloof from the stock market, owing both to the railway and\r\nindustrial prosecutions, and hostile State legislation, and the great\r\nactivity in trade, and in land, mining, and other speculation calling\r\nfor a great deal of money. Speculation outside of Wall Street was never\r\nmore rampant.\r\n\r\nAt the same time stocks were very largely concentrated in the hands of a\r\nfew men of great wealth, who were anxious to sell them at improving\r\nprices, and they could only do this by making a market for them. They\r\nhad in this endeavor a hard row to hoe, as the farmers say, for money\r\nwas scarce and dear on time, not only here but all over the world, with\r\nthe European market, like our own, overloaded with securities for sale,\r\nand, worse than all, with no demand for them from investors. They were\r\nin a tight place, rich as they were.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs was reflected in the gradual and persistent\r\ndecline of British Consols, that had always been rated as the best and\r\nsafest securities in the world, to 81, the lowest price at which they\r\nhad sold since 1848—the year of the Smith O’Brien uprising in Ireland,\r\nwhen they touched 80. The depression in the other European stock markets\r\nwas almost equally great, particularly in Berlin. We could, therefore,\r\nlook for no market for our stocks, or our vast accumulations of new\r\nrailway and other bonds, in Europe. The foreign markets were closed to\r\nus, and wanted nothing American but our gold. Our speculative\r\ncapitalists loaded down with these unsalable securities were severely\r\nhandicapped. From being giants, they had become cripples. Their wealth\r\nwas tied up instead of being in the liquid form of poorer men who had\r\ntheir money in savings banks, withdrawable at any time. One New York\r\nCity institution, the Bowery Savings Bank, held and still holds over a\r\nhundred million dollars of deposits.\r\n\r\nHere was wealth in a liquid form that our large Wall Street capitalists,\r\nlike most of the large corporations, sadly lacked, and they well might\r\nhave envied their poorer brethren who owned these deposits. In\r\nproportion to their means, the poorer men were better off than the rich.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that our rich men undertook too much, both in the forming of\r\nsyndicates to underwrite new bond issues and in attempting to control\r\nthe stock market under adverse circumstances. They overestimated\r\nthemselves very largely, or, in slang parlance, bit off more than they\r\ncould chew, and when the shoe pinched most severely in March, and again\r\nin August last, they had to sell stocks at a heavy sacrifice to pay off\r\nthe loans that were called in by the banks, or to meet the calls for\r\nmore margin. For once they were really hard up.\r\n\r\nThis over-extension of Wall Street capitalists, with their efforts to\r\nunduly inflate prices, had its counterpart elsewhere, for such\r\nover-trading was by no means confined to them, but extended to, and was\r\nconspicuously shown by, railway and industrial corporations in their\r\nefforts to keep up with the increasing demands upon them consequent on\r\nthe country’s great prosperity and natural growth. This over-extension\r\nwas in the form of excessive expenditures and vast issues of bonds,\r\nstocks, and short-time notes. These far exceeded in aggregate amount the\r\ncapacity of our own investors to absorb them. Hence, hundreds of\r\nmillions of these are still being carried by the banking syndicates that\r\nunderwrote them, and of course they at present show a very heavy\r\naggregate loss. This kind of medicine is much disliked even by\r\nmulti-millionaires.\r\n\r\nStimulated by the country’s enormous prosperity during the last few\r\nyears, we have gone ahead too fast in all kinds of new and costly\r\nconstruction work and improvements. We have, in fact, gone ahead\r\nregardless of expense; and railway and manufacturing corporations have\r\nstretched their credit, in too many instances, almost to the breaking\r\npoint. Meanwhile the railways have been overtaxed with traffic and the\r\nmanufactories overrun with orders for their product, and they still are\r\nso notwithstanding all the much discussed and confidently predicted\r\nfalling off in trade.\r\n\r\nThrough over-taxing their capacity, their working capital, and their\r\ncredit to keep up with it, the national prosperity has proved a\r\ntwo-edged sword to many corporations as well as individual firms, and\r\nthe greed for excessive profits among them led to much of the corporate\r\ndishonesty, illegal acts and methods, and wholesale graft in high places\r\nwhich we have seen exposed. These excesses and irregularities are now\r\nbeing corrected.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that their exposure, from time to time, gave blow after blow\r\nto public confidence, and kept investors from buying stocks, and turned\r\ntheir attention and speculative enterprise in other directions, and into\r\nother channels. These exposures and violations of law naturally aroused\r\nsevere public criticism and indignation, and called for investigation by\r\nthe Federal Government. In this President Roosevelt took the lead for\r\nthe purpose of correcting the mal-administration, the abuse of power,\r\nand the illegal practices that had been exposed.\r\n\r\nIt was far from his intention to disturb public confidence among the\r\nstockholders of the railway and other corporations that, through their\r\nofficers, had been guilty of illegal and fraudulent acts, particularly\r\nrebating. His object was by extirpating abuses to secure honest and\r\nlawful methods of management, and so protect and benefit investors in\r\nbonds and stocks, and secure justice and equality for shippers of\r\nproduce and merchandise of all kinds, with the same rates for all, small\r\nand great, rich and poor, without special privileges to any, great\r\ncorporations being compelled to respect the law as well as small ones.\r\nThe righting and correction of wrongs practised in violation of the\r\nInter-State and anti-trust laws of Congress would have had no disturbing\r\neffect upon investors, and the public mind, if properly viewed; and it\r\nrequires a stretch of imagination to hold Mr. Roosevelt even indirectly\r\nresponsible for the twenty-nine-million fine, the immediate cause of the\r\ndisturbance in Wall Street that followed it.\r\n\r\nUnder the general monetary and other conditions then existing, that fine\r\nproved to be the last straw that broke the camel’s back, and, as is too\r\noften the case, the innocent stockholders were made to suffer with the\r\nguilty in the collapse of the stock market. The judge who frightened\r\ninvestors with visions of confiscation by inflicting that preposterous\r\nfine, must bear the responsibility of starting that downfall, not\r\nPresident Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1907, was one of the most remarkable months in the history of\r\nWall Street. After opening in profound gloom, with the stock market\r\ncrumbling rapidly away under the rush of investors and speculators to\r\nsell, regardless of price, and with the bears and alarmists busily at\r\nwork predicting widespread disaster, few expected during the twelve\r\nexciting and perilous days of the crisis that the month would close with\r\nthe stock market gradually recovering, confidence somewhat restored, and\r\nmany of both the bulls and the bears as unreasonably eager to buy as\r\nthey before had been to sell, while the sentiment of the Street had\r\nchanged from extreme depression and despondency to a cheerful and\r\nhopeful optimism. Incidentally the bulls were hanging the hides of some\r\nof the bears on the fence.\r\n\r\nWhen the fall in prices was greatest, new low records were reached for\r\nmany of even the best stocks, not only for the year but for several or\r\nmany years, as in the case of New York Central, which sold at 99½, or\r\nlower than at any time since 1898. In those twelve eventful days\r\ninvestors might well shudder, for market values shrunk about three\r\nthousand millions of dollars, if we include all the stocks dealt in on\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange measured by their lowest prices and total\r\ncapitalization. But, of course, the actual losses sustained were\r\ncomparatively small. Wall Street as soon forgets its sorrows as its\r\njoys, and looks ahead.\r\n\r\nWhen at their lowest prices—and I give them as specimen\r\nbricks—Amalgamated Copper stock had depreciated 43 millions, Union\r\nPacific 51 millions, Northern Pacific 36 millions, Great Northern 34\r\nmillions, New York Central 25 millions, Pennsylvania 28 millions, and\r\nSouthern Pacific 21 millions, while in the Curb market Standard Oil\r\nstock suffered a shrinkage of 80 millions, and American Tobacco stock of\r\n32 millions. That much of oil seemed to have been cast upon the waters,\r\nand that much of tobacco to have gone up in smoke.\r\n\r\nThe partial recovery in the stock market and the gradual return of\r\nconfidence were coincident with and in the face of a rising market for\r\ncotton. There was an advance in middling cotton to 13½ cents a pound,\r\nthe highest price on record for thirty-two years. Yet there was no\r\ndearth in the supply of cotton, and no sign of a “corner,” or the\r\npossibility of one, and we carried over into the new crop year, which\r\nbegan on the 1st of September, a visible supply of 1,200,000 bales of\r\nAmerican cotton, making a world’s supply of 2,300,000 bales, or nearly\r\n540,000 more than at the same time last year. These statistics may be\r\ndry, like a certain brand of champagne, but they tell their story in a\r\nnutshell.\r\n\r\nI dwell on cotton because cotton is still king in the South, although\r\nless powerful in its sway than before the war, owing to the South’s\r\ndevelopment of its other resources and its more diversified financial\r\nand commercial interests. It is fortunate in not having all its eggs in\r\none basket.\r\n\r\nThe recuperative power shown by Wall Street, after the crisis, was\r\ntypical of that of the whole country. Speculative sentiment quickly\r\npasses from one extreme to the other. We are a great and progressive\r\npeople and soon recover from disasters however formidable. We had a\r\nconspicuous illustration of this in the San Francisco catastrophe, to\r\nsay nothing of the civil war. But a period of stability and comparative\r\nquiet would now be salutary. The recovery in the stock market,\r\nnotwithstanding the severity of the recent strain, was mainly due to the\r\nsober second thought of the people, in conjunction with the announcement\r\nof the plan of the Secretary of the Treasury to ease the money market by\r\nmaking deposits weekly in the National banks of the large cities till\r\nthe middle of October. This allayed anxiety as to the money market and\r\nit will, or may, have the desired effect in a large degree till the crop\r\nmoving season is over, by preventing the undue locking up of money in\r\nthe Sub-Treasuries at a time when it is most imperatively needed for\r\nbusiness uses. The better feeling resulted, early in September, in the\r\n40 millions of New York City 4½ per cent. bonds being bid for five times\r\nover, although at premiums averaging only a trifle more than 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe very severe decline in copper and the copper stocks, this month,\r\nhas, however, caused some renewed and widespread disturbance, and the\r\nreduction of dividends by the Calumet and Hecla and Quincy copper\r\ncompanies will doubtless be followed by a general reduction of copper\r\ndividends. This is at present the worst feature of the general\r\nsituation, as it indicates a largely reduced trade demand for copper,\r\nand foreshadows a curtailment of copper mining.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury plan is only a makeshift, however. The true remedy for this\r\ncurrency evil lies in the abolition of the independent Treasury and\r\nSub-Treasury system, and the substitution in its place of now existing\r\nNational bank depositaries. Congress should abolish it accordingly, and\r\nit probably will if the banks unite in demanding it, and so keep the\r\ncurrency in the banks, and in active circulation. The present antiquated\r\nsystem has been outgrown by the country, and is a reproach to our\r\nnational intelligence as a great commercial people.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the improvement in conditions here, and partly\r\nbecause of it, for example is contagious, there was a decided turn for\r\nthe better in both sentiment and prices on the London Stock Exchange and\r\nthe Berlin Bourse. Apprehensions which had been felt there of the\r\ntrouble here extending, so as to more or less seriously involve Europe,\r\nsubsided when it was seen that we had regained our composure, and were\r\ngoing ahead as usual. The situation had indeed changed so much that it\r\nreally looked as if nothing very disastrous had happened, despite the\r\nhysteria and the crash that followed the spectacular fine of that\r\nNapoleon of the bench, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, a long name—or\r\nsome of it—that will be remembered, especially by the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, long after the fine has been set aside, or O.K.’d, by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court. But it would be rash to assume that the\r\ntrouble is all over. There are still many weak structures and disturbing\r\ncauses that menace the situation. There is future danger in a too sudden\r\nrecovery of confidence, and in under-estimating the danger we have\r\npassed through.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, because of what the Government has done to correct abuses in\r\nthe management of the railways and the trusts, their stockholders will\r\nfind that it has added to the security of their holdings of railway and\r\nother stocks, at the same time that it will prevent the acquisition of\r\nlarge fortunes, in dishonest ways, at their expense. The business\r\nsituation will also be the safer and sounder and more conservative for\r\nit, and its general betterment will compensate for the suffering\r\ninvolved in the ordeal we have passed through. Often out of evil there\r\ncometh good.\r\n\r\nAll concerned in the ownership and management of corporations should\r\nwillingly conform to the Federal laws now in force, and, if any of these\r\nshould prove onerous, unjust, or defective, Congress can be called upon\r\nto amend them. They might as well make a virtue of necessity. The same\r\ncourse should be pursued with regard to railway rates, fixed by the\r\nrespective States, until these, and their justice or injustice, have\r\nbeen passed upon by the Supreme Court of the United States. Through this\r\ncompliance with law the popular craze against the railways and the\r\nTrusts will gradually subside, while the misconceptions and exaggerated\r\nviews concerning Mr. Roosevelt’s policy and its influence will die out\r\nin the clearer light of a better understanding.\r\n\r\nOf one thing we may be sure, and that is that President Roosevelt will\r\nalways stand firm in his policy of enforcing the laws against wrongdoing\r\nby corporations. We heard this from Secretary Taft in his strong\r\nendorsement of that policy, and we heard it re-affirmed in the\r\nPresident’s Provincetown speech. But the penalties should always be\r\ninflicted on the individual officers responsible for violations of law,\r\nand these, to be effectual, should involve imprisonment, not fines\r\nagainst them or the corporations. That remedy is the only certain cure\r\nfor the disease, if it again appears. By uniting in support of the\r\nPresident’s policy, which simply means the enforcement of the\r\nInter-State Commerce law and the Sherman Anti-Trust law, as amended,\r\nthose in control of railways and industrial corporations will increase\r\nthe value of their stocks, and raise their credit both at home and\r\nabroad, while inspiring the other officers, and the rank and file of\r\ntheir employees, with a higher sense of honor, and responsibility to the\r\npublic, than was compatible with the old rebating and graft-seeking\r\ntrickery.\r\n\r\nA large part of Wall Street was in such a nervous state during the\r\ncrisis that it jumped at shadows, and trembled at a touch. It shuddered\r\nwhen Attorney General Bonaparte facetiously said that there was a fine\r\ncovey of game among the large capitalists in control of corporations,\r\nand that he would be a poor marksman who would not bring some of the\r\nbirds down.\r\n\r\nIt found fresh cause for alarm in the fight between the Southern Railway\r\nand the Southern States, and when the railway had its license canceled\r\nby Alabama it had a fresh attack of “nerves,” and, later, saw an ominous\r\nevent in the surrender of the railway to the State, to recover its\r\nlicense. It feared the anti-corporation storm would wreck and devastate\r\nthe business of the country. But after a storm there cometh a calm, and\r\nthe nation, as a whole, is unscathed.\r\n\r\nIn considering the situation we must never fail to bear in mind that\r\nalthough investors, and holders of stocks and bonds, and many of the\r\nweaklings of the business world, have been made to suffer severely by\r\nthe stern and uncompromising course of the Federal Government and some\r\nof the States—and that confidence was so undermined as to cause a\r\ntemporary halt in enterprise—good results will follow. This ordeal has\r\nbeen at least a purifying one, and while the East has exaggerated its\r\ndisturbing influence, the West and South have been comparatively\r\nindifferent to it. Those sections were never more prosperous and\r\nprogressive than they are now. This arises from the fact that the East,\r\nbeing richer than the West, and having much more invested capital,\r\nespecially in stocks and bonds, is correspondingly more interested in\r\nthe market for these than the West, and more disturbed by great\r\ndepression in Wall Street, and the causes producing it. The East is,\r\ntherefore, much more likely to borrow trouble than the West or the\r\nSouth, especially when it cannot borrow money.\r\n\r\nThis borrowing of trouble took the usual form of fearing from day to day\r\nthat worse consequences of the crisis awaited us than we had yet\r\nexperienced, and it was increased among business men and corporations\r\nwhen they found their banks would no longer accept as collaterals for\r\nloans and discounts many of the securities they held for investment, and\r\nupon which they had been previously able to borrow in proportion to\r\ntheir market price. They found, too, they were generally unable even to\r\nborrow, on time, what they wanted, on the best of collaterals.\r\n\r\nThey were therefore cramped for money, and this restricted or\r\nembarrassed them in their business, and in a few instances caused their\r\nfailure. Here we recognize the close connection that exists between\r\ntrade and finance. The severe depression on the Stock Exchange so far\r\nimpaired the market value of stocks and bonds as to make the banks and\r\nother money lenders everywhere distrustful of credits, the result being\r\nthis inability to borrow, or at least to borrow all that was necessary.\r\nSo it was not surprising that those with insufficient working capital\r\nwere badly cramped, and had to curtail their business and make\r\nsacrifices, or go to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe curtailment from this cause among mercantile and manufacturing firms\r\nhas been very extensive. It was better than going to the wall, however,\r\nand the after-effect upon the business situation has been salutary and\r\nwholesome. It has acted like a safety valve in checking over-trading,\r\nover-capitalizing, over-borrowing, over-stocking, and overdoing\r\ngenerally. It has slackened the pace at which too many scantily equipped\r\nconcerns were going on the road to ruin. So it has made the business\r\nsituation stronger and safer for the sound and solvent; and the\r\nelimination of a mushroom growth of irresponsible credit-seekers should\r\nbe welcomed by the banks.\r\n\r\nWall Street is the great monetary clearing house of the country whose\r\nramifications are co-extensive with the nation itself. It does not\r\ncreate values, but it reflects everything affecting securities and\r\ncommodities, and represents all material interests. It is an unfailing\r\nbarometer of values and the times. So those who say a heavy fall, or a\r\npanic, in stocks only affects Wall Street speculators shoot very wide of\r\nthe mark. Wall Street radiates its influence over the whole country, and\r\nto a large and growing extent over the whole world, and it, or I should\r\nsay New York, is destined, within no very long time, to become the\r\nfinancial center of the world. The recent severe financial disturbance\r\nin Wall Street, resulting in a reduction in the value of securities\r\naggregating over $3,000,000, has proven one important thing, and that is\r\nthat Wall Street and the industrial interests of the country have\r\nfinally largely separated, and that a panic in Wall Street, while\r\ndepressing, need not necessarily cause one at the same time in\r\nmercantile circles.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some of the Trusts and railway companies, accustomed to driving\r\nwith a too free hand, and without much regard for the law, considered\r\nthey were being handled very harshly by the law officers of the\r\nGovernment when they were brought up with a round turn and heavily fined\r\nfor rebating. But, as they had violated the law wilfully, they had only\r\nthemselves to blame, and they well knew that the way of the transgressor\r\nis hard—when convicted. There was some reason, however, in the complaint\r\nof some of the railways that in many of the States they had been made\r\nthe targets of an aggressive popular policy towards corporations, that\r\nis, the policy of enforcing rigorously laws which might in some cases,\r\nsuch as the passenger and commodity rate laws by the States, finally be\r\ndeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur large railway and industrial corporations were primarily responsible\r\nfor the disturbance and loss of confidence in the monetary situation\r\nthrough their recklessly extravagant issues of bonds, stocks, and\r\nshort-term notes. For a long time they seemed to be doing their best to\r\nkill, in this way, the goose that laid the golden egg, and they finally\r\nsucceeded in exhausting both their own borrowing power and the ability\r\nof the banks to lend, or of investors, at home or abroad, to purchase\r\ntheir issues. This tremendous output of new securities had to be\r\nchecked, for it not only glutted the market, and overloaded underwriting\r\nsyndicates, but depreciated values and created distrust among investors.\r\nIt was piling Pelion on Ossa with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of last March in the stock market, and the more prolonged\r\none of August, were obviously outbreaks of the same malady, the latter\r\nintensified by that twenty-nine-million fine. The distrust that caused\r\nthese explosions had been brewing for years, and had its origin in the\r\nwholesale issues that over-taxed the money market and the lending\r\ncapacity of the country and also squeezed Europe like an orange for all\r\nthe money it had to lend.\r\n\r\nIt was righteous retribution that overtook some, at least, of the\r\nwrongdoers among the larger corporations. Their chickens had come home\r\nto roost through their own unrestricted and extravagant exploitations\r\nand illegal and dishonest practices.\r\n\r\nThe wholesome remedy of their discontinuance, combined with proper\r\ncurtailment and conservatism, has been forced upon them by the\r\nnecessities of the situation; and the enforcement of the new laws has no\r\ndoubt put a stop to at least the most flagrant of the corporate abuses\r\nbefore prevalent. But the too sudden application of the brake at a\r\ncritical turn in the road may at any time work havoc; and it is doubtful\r\nwhether rigorous prosecutions for violations of law in years gone by are\r\nnot productive of more harm than good. They are always unsettling, and\r\nunsettlement involves a corresponding weakening of confidence.\r\n\r\nBut future offences should be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the\r\nlaw, and the railway companies and industrial corporations now fully\r\nunderstand this; and not one of them would be likely to run the risk of\r\nagain violating the law, especially with imprisonment for offenders as\r\nthe penalty. We must, however, always be careful not to make the remedy\r\nworse than the disease. In other words, the interests of the country at\r\nlarge are of more importance than the punishment of corporate wrongdoers\r\nfor long past offences. Some allowance must be made for the heat of\r\ncompetition in the strenuous years we have passed through, and the\r\nformer general tendency to moral laxity of men controlling and\r\nrepresenting corporations, when acting in their corporate capacity, a\r\nlaxity they would probably not have been guilty of in their own personal\r\naffairs. This would, of course, indicate their want of a proper sense of\r\nresponsibility and honor. But that failing is not uncommon. Now their\r\neyes have been opened to the danger of being without it.\r\n\r\nThe apparent indifference of some of the principal prosecuting officers\r\nof the Government to investment interests, in the published interviews\r\nwith them, was, however, complained of as of itself disturbing and\r\ndisconcerting to investors. It may have indicated a supposition that\r\nonly capitalists, speculators, and those of large means were affected by\r\nthe decline in stocks and bonds. The erroneousness of this impression is\r\nshown by the stock transfer books of every large railway and industrial\r\ncorporation, in which the small holders of small means are very\r\nnumerous, running up to several or many thousands in each corporation,\r\nand reaching a very large aggregate of shares. The small investors thus\r\nsuffer by depreciation with the large ones, and even the people of small\r\nmeans with only savings bank deposits are, as we can all see, menaced\r\nthrough their dividends by the depreciation of the securities held for\r\ninvestment by the savings banks. Their depositors may learn a lesson in\r\nfinance from this.\r\n\r\nThose of the State of New York report for the half year ending on June\r\n30, 1907, a new high aggregate for deposits and resources, the deposits\r\nbeing $1,394,296,034 and the resources $1,490,760,675. Yet their\r\nsurplus, calculated on the market value of their holdings of stocks and\r\nbonds, had fallen from $108,671,735 on June 30, 1906, to $95,743,206.\r\nHere we have a shrinkage through the decline in prices of nearly\r\nthirteen millions or twelve per cent. of their surplus, in one year,\r\nalthough the savings banks are by law restricted in their investments to\r\nthe most stable of first-class securities. If we go back to their\r\nreports of January 1, 1901, we find their surplus was $118,294,674,\r\nshowing that the market for bonds has meanwhile been on a declining\r\nscale. Thus the savings banks and Wall Street are shown to be related.\r\n\r\nIn this August crisis there was far too much hysteria shown where calm\r\njudgment was called for, and this hysteria made the situation dangerous,\r\nalthough there was nothing dangerous in the actual condition of the\r\ncountry, apart from the distrust of credits and the scarcity of money on\r\ntime, resulting from the immense activity of general business here and\r\nthe monetary stringency abroad. A moderate slowing down of business is\r\nconsequently the best remedy for this excess, and the one that will in\r\nthe most direct and natural way generally restore ease to the money\r\nmarket. Meanwhile, the banks should assist within proper limits, when\r\ncalled upon, corporations and firms of proved earning capacity and known\r\nto be sound, and discriminate against those that have only an insecure\r\nor speculative foundation. This would accord with the teaching of the\r\nBible, “To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall\r\nbe taken away even that which he hath.”\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling against very rich men, who have acquired their\r\nwealth through the trusts and railways, is not a prejudice against\r\nproperty, but against the supposed ways and means by which their large\r\nfortunes were acquired. The impression is, with many, that those means\r\nwere dishonest, and that their rapacious grasping for riches involved\r\ncorruption in corporate management, and, in general, a feathering of\r\ntheir own nests at the expense of the people, or at best other people.\r\nTo see them flaunting what they consider their ill-gotten gains\r\nexasperates men, and spreads discontent and unrest among the millions.\r\nEnvy and malice are easily cultivated.\r\n\r\nIt is an inequality of wealth that they resent because they believe it\r\nto have been created by rebating, stock watering, inside speculation,\r\nand tricks and devices by which other people’s money was got unjustly,\r\nand by various illegal and fraudulent practices and abuse of corporate\r\npower. The exposures made from time to time tended to confirm the people\r\nin this impression and prejudice, and President Roosevelt was only\r\nresponding to their call when he urged the prosecution of the\r\ncorporations known to have been among the most flagrant violators of the\r\nanti-rebate law.\r\n\r\nThese violators were not the corporations, which we all know have no\r\nsouls, but their officers; yet the officers have gone thus far unwhipped\r\nof justice, much to the disgust of the masses of the people. But in\r\nfuture this defect should be remedied, and rich and poor among the\r\nindividual violators of the law should be prosecuted criminally, and\r\nupon conviction sent to jail like any other criminal. I can understand\r\nhow many men, who as private individuals would have avoided criminal or\r\nwrongful acts, had no scruples about violating laws in their corporate\r\ncapacity. This, however, is an indefensible plea. They showed a moral\r\nlaxity which has been exposed and branded as a crime, and instead of it\r\nlet us hope they have now a sense of corporate responsibility and\r\nhonesty, as a result of these Government prosecutions, and the knowledge\r\nthat in future such violations of law can hardly be repeated with\r\nimpunity. They will certainly find that honesty is the best policy.\r\n\r\nThe cry against Mr. Roosevelt has been so indiscriminate that it would\r\noften be amusing but for its serious aspect. If a corporation, firm, or\r\nindividual fails in business nowadays, Mr. Roosevelt is blamed. If a man\r\nmakes a bad investment in anything, or if his creditors press him for\r\npayment, or his creditors are slow to pay or go into bankruptcy, he\r\nblames Mr. Roosevelt, while the vast host of large and small investors\r\nin stocks and bonds all over the country are almost of one mind in\r\nblaming Mr. Roosevelt for the depreciation in the market value of their\r\nstocks and bonds.\r\n\r\nI should not be surprised if very soon even the ladies who have lost at\r\nthe fashionable game of bridge will blame Mr. Roosevelt for their\r\nlosses. Everyone, nowadays, dumps his misfortunes upon Roosevelt, and\r\nattributes the cause to him. I recently heard of a man who had been\r\ndoing a thriving business on Long Island shore catching eels and selling\r\nthem in the New York market. Lately the eels have stopped going into his\r\npots to be caught, so he is now going about howling against Roosevelt\r\nfor ruining his business. That is no more ridiculous than many other\r\nthings for which he is blamed, without having had anything to do with\r\nthem. In thus complaining they overlook the long train of causes and\r\nevents that led up to this year’s disturbances in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThe public must have a scapegoat in times of excitement and discontent,\r\nand many of our wealthy people thoughtlessly held the President\r\nresponsible for the disturbances and unsettlement we have witnessed, and\r\ntheir own losses and disappointments, because he had taken the\r\ninitiative in calling upon the law officers of the Government to\r\nprosecute the railway and industrial corporations known to have violated\r\nthe law. They seemed unaware that he did this to stop those illegal\r\npractices which had made enormous fortunes for the favored few, and\r\nenabled them to crush or impoverish their competitors and impose upon\r\nthe people. He was the people’s champion.\r\n\r\nHe did not advise these prosecutions without good cause, for in every\r\ninstance where a case was tried on its merits the Government secured a\r\nconviction. Fines of large, but not enormous, amounts were levied\r\naccordingly against many of our principal railway companies, including\r\nthe New York Central, and against large industrial corporations,\r\nincluding the Sugar Trust, for rebating and accepting rebates. But as\r\nthe punishment was always by fining the corporations, and never by the\r\nimprisonment of the officers, who were the actual violators of the law,\r\nthe masses of the people complained that while they themselves would\r\nhave been sent to jail if guilty of criminal offences, these high and\r\nmighty railway and Trust officials were not, and that by fining the\r\ncorporations only the innocent stockholders were made to suffer instead\r\nof the individual wrongdoers. Their complaint was just.\r\n\r\nI trace the causes of this year’s state of affairs as far back as the\r\nfailure in London of Baring Bros. & Co., in 1890, for that unexpected\r\nevent gave a shock to confidence, and curtailed credits all over the\r\nworld. Indeed, the long career and prestige of that celebrated and\r\nhonorable house gave it a credit in both hemispheres that was second\r\nonly to that of the Bank of England, and its collapse wiped out of\r\nexistence the immense amount of credit and the banking facilities that\r\nit had enjoyed so long. This involved a corresponding international\r\ncontraction of the medium of exchange, and tightened the purse strings\r\nof the world, and it continued to do so long after the failure had\r\npassed into history.\r\n\r\nThe Boer war involved, in another way, great and prolonged depression in\r\nEngland. It drained her of an immense amount of money, and drained her\r\nalso of a vast number of men whose labor was needed at home. To raise\r\nthe sinews of war, she had to issue from time to time large amounts of\r\nconsols, and these, being in excess of the power of investors to absorb\r\nthem, steadily declined, and now—years after the war—they are still\r\nheavy. It naturally surprised the world when last August they reached\r\n81, the lowest point in their long decline, and John Bull was sorely\r\npuzzled to define the cause.\r\n\r\nThe Russian-Japanese war was another very costly and depressing factor,\r\nand adversely affected international money markets because it involved\r\nimmense borrowing by both Russia and Japan, and their bonds are still\r\nhelping to glut the European markets, and to some extent our own, as\r\nmany of the Japanese bonds are held here. At the same time France is\r\nparticularly unfortunate in being burdened with a vast amount of Russian\r\nsecurities, far more than ever before, which leaves her correspondingly\r\npowerless to make other investments, or extend assistance, when needed,\r\nto other countries.\r\n\r\nThen came our Pacific coast disaster, the earthquake and fire at San\r\nFrancisco, which involved enormous losses there, and struck Wall Street\r\nand its speculative capitalists a tremendous blow, for the latter were\r\nabout as heavily loaded with stocks at that time as before the March\r\ncrash, and these had a severe break in consequence. It also involved\r\nEnglish and German as well as American fire insurance companies in heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this train of disastrous events, both here and in Europe,\r\nhas been more or less cumulative, and their influence was so great and\r\nfar reaching that it is still being felt, especially by our rich and\r\nspeculative Wall Street men, with little of their wealth in the liquid\r\nform they would prefer, notwithstanding their heavy liquidation. They\r\nare still tied up with large amounts of stocks and bonds, bought long\r\nago at higher prices, and for which there is but a limited market. As\r\nthe same condition of affairs exists in Europe, they may find some\r\ncomfort in that fact, for we are told misery loves company. They\r\ncertainly have plenty of it.\r\n\r\nFortunately the reports of the National and State banks all over the\r\ncountry show that they are in a sound and strong condition, the result\r\nof proper conservatism, and in protecting themselves they have protected\r\ntheir depositors and stockholders. So the banks have escaped being\r\ninvolved in serious losses through the crisis in the stock market, and\r\nare in a position, now that the depression, if not over, is at least no\r\nlonger acute, to lend assistance in the recovery that sooner or later\r\ninevitably follows such a cyclone and excessive decline in prices as we\r\nhave witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe banks, however, have in common with all other holders of stocks and\r\nbonds suffered loss by the depression in price of the securities owned\r\nby themselves, this being, as I have shown, particularly the case with\r\nthe savings banks, and it may possibly, if not soon recovered, lead to a\r\nreduction of their dividends. If it should so eventuate, it would be an\r\nobject lesson that would show the poor man that even his savings bank\r\ndeposit was not beyond the depressing influence of a Wall Street crisis.\r\nBut let us hope that there will be no such far-reaching result. The\r\nsavings banks have, however, already deducted large amounts from the\r\nvalue of their holdings of securities on account of the past and present\r\nyear’s depreciation. Few of their depositors understand this, and where\r\nignorance is bliss ’tis folly to be wise.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in being Americans and having so great a country under\r\nour sovereignty, for its vast geographical extent, its diversified\r\ninterests and resources, and wide differences in climate make one\r\nsection to a certain extent independent of another. Thus the South, the\r\nWest, and the Northwest looked with complacency upon the Wall Street\r\ncrisis as something confined to the East. There was no falling off in\r\nbank clearings, no lessening of the activity in trade South or West. The\r\nindustrial and agricultural resources of the country were unaffected,\r\nand the outlook for the crops and trade is reassuring in all directions.\r\nYet last month many feared the country was going to the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe last Government report indicates a decrease in the estimated crop of\r\nwheat, but with the invisible left-over supplies, it will fall little,\r\nif any, short of last year’s crop, while the corn and other grain crops\r\nwill largely exceed the demand for home consumption. The cotton crop,\r\ntoo, which the planters will soon begin to gather, promises to be almost\r\nequal to the last. Yet its price is much higher. The grain crops, by\r\nreason of damage to the crops in Europe and elsewhere, and higher\r\nprices, are likely to yield more when marketed here and abroad than in\r\nrecent years. Our exports of cotton, too, in the last fiscal year were\r\nvalued at more than half a billion of dollars, while our exports of\r\nmanufactures aggregated 750 millions. Our coal, iron, copper, gold,\r\nsilver, and other mineral products will be larger in 1907 than in 1906,\r\nand our total industrial income will show no diminution. Yet in August\r\nmany felt as blue as indigo about the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stuyvesant Fish_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nI say all this to show that the railways will have all the freight\r\ntraffic they want, and the enforcement of existing laws relating to them\r\nwill be more likely to increase than diminish their net earnings, for\r\nthey will gain largely by the stoppage of rebating and other abuses.\r\nSome of our State and possibly some of our Federal laws may be too\r\ndrastic, and, so far as their requirements are unreasonable, oppressive\r\nor unnecessary, they should, and doubtless will be, amended by Congress\r\nand the States, or set aside as unconstitutional by the courts, as in\r\nthe case of Pennsylvania’s two cents a mile rate, for an unjust or\r\nvexatious law is abhorrent to justice—justice so well typified by that\r\nblind goddess who holds the scales on such an even balance in the world\r\nof art. Corporations, as much as individuals, are entitled to a square\r\ndeal, and a square deal for all is what President Roosevelt is working\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAs it is, most of the Western railways have, like the Southern lines, a\r\ndouble track traffic for a single track road, and there is abiding\r\nprosperity in this plethora of business. It is a sort of embarrassment\r\nof riches, for, notwithstanding the vast additions that all the railways\r\nhave made to their rolling stock and motive power in recent years, and\r\nthe enormous amounts spent in building branches and double tracking\r\nportions of their main lines, and increasing their terminal facilities,\r\nthey are still unable expeditiously to cope with the present\r\nsuperabundance of traffic; and this will naturally increase with the\r\ngrowth of population. So the outlook for their stockholders is better\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nFor his courageous course in unearthing and prosecuting the rebating\r\nevil and other wrongdoing, President Roosevelt is entitled to the\r\nhighest praise; and I reiterate that the heads of railway and other\r\nlarge corporations will best serve their own and the country’s interests\r\nby co-operating with him and his administration to secure strict\r\ncompliance with the law in future, with the hope of clemency for their\r\npast violations of law.\r\n\r\nThat the railway companies always, as a matter of policy, are disposed\r\nto be conciliatory and not willing to be openly antagonistic to the\r\nenforcement of law, is beyond question. Like the American people, they\r\nare law-abiding. We saw an instance of this in the course of the\r\nSouthern Railway and other Southern lines, in withdrawing their appeal\r\nfrom the State Court to the United States District Court in the rate\r\ncase, and agreeing to charge only the State rates, namely, two and\r\none-quarter cents a mile, in North Carolina, two and one-half cents in\r\nAlabama, and three cents in Virginia, till a decision on the\r\nconstitutionality of the State rate laws is rendered by the United\r\nStates Supreme Court. This concession was avowedly made to avoid further\r\nconflict with those States, although the companies were within their\r\nlegal rights in the appeal they had taken. They were wise.\r\n\r\nAfter the good work the Government has already done in exposing and\r\npunishing the rebate evil and other abuses, it would seem that the end\r\nin view—namely, their stoppage—has been substantially achieved. I\r\ntherefore think you will agree with me that the Government can well\r\nafford to rest on its secured results and its laurels, and discontinue\r\nprosecutions for old offences, while holding all to the strictest\r\naccountability for violations of law in the future. The law-breaking\r\ncorporations have been taught a lesson that they will never forget, and\r\nhave suffered penalties that they will not be willing to incur again.\r\n\r\nBy the Government thus showing clemency towards the offenders they would\r\nall the more be put on their good behavior, and the clamor against Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, in which they have been the leaders, would gradually subside.\r\nThose who have been punished by the law are always very likely to have a\r\nbad opinion of it, and to retaliate by charging injustice. Hence the old\r\nEnglish saying, “No rogue e’er felt the halter draw with good opinion of\r\nthe law.”\r\n\r\nThis reminds me that the two international congresses of socialists held\r\nin England and Germany in August, one at Cambridge and the other at\r\nStuttgart, showed what large masses of the people there are laboring to\r\noverthrow the existing law and order of society by putting restrictions\r\nand fetters upon individual achievement, genius, and capacity for good\r\nwork, and by giving the inferior masses all that they would allow the\r\nsuperior and educated to enjoy, a levelling process entirely\r\ninconsistent with Americanism, for it would destroy all incentive to\r\ngreat efforts, and reduce all to a uniformity inimical to progress. Some\r\nof the decline in British Consols is attributed to this socialist\r\nagitation in England, and notably in the House of Commons, several of\r\nits members being radical socialists; and the same is true of Germany\r\nand its Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, which has been for some time the storm-center of Europe,\r\nsocialism and its revolutionary doctrines, and especially the meetings\r\nand preachings of the rampant of the socialists, have added to the\r\ndisturbance, distrust, and depression caused by the monetary situation.\r\nThere, as here, over-expansion in all directions had over-taxed the\r\nmoney market and glutted the Bourse, the banks, and the speculative\r\ncapitalists with new issues of securities that were either unsalable, or\r\nsalable only at a ruinous sacrifice, owing to the heavy shrinkage in\r\nprices, and the absence of demand at the low prices. This presents an\r\nalmost parallel case to our own, except as to the effect of socialistic\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nWe have too many blatant socialists here, but they are not planted in\r\ncongenial soil, and their demagoguery and schemes for the destruction of\r\nsociety as it exists will yield no harvest, for in this great country,\r\nwhere all are free and blessed with equal opportunities, there is no\r\nreason, no just cause, or excuse for socialism. The agitation in favor\r\nof socialism and its doctrines is not American. It is antagonistic to\r\nAmerican institutions, and comes almost entirely from those who have\r\nfled from oppression and despotism in Russia and elsewhere in the Old\r\nWorld to our shores, and who fail to see, as they should, that the\r\nconditions which have given rise to socialism in Europe are entirely\r\ndifferent here. So socialism will never take root in the United States,\r\nhowever much it may be agitated by those of foreign birth who\r\nreciprocate our hospitality in giving them all the rights of citizenship\r\nthat we possess ourselves, by advocating the downfall and destruction of\r\nour institutions and system of society, which has made this great nation\r\nof free and independent citizens what it is to-day, the wonder of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of France has continuously felt, but resolutely fought against,\r\ndepressing foreign influences by tenaciously holding on to its gold, and\r\nit attracted more of it recently from this country by paying interest in\r\ntransit. Both London. and Berlin have long been trying hard to get gold\r\nfrom France, but without success. This determined policy, and refusal to\r\nfinance anything that would take money out of the country, is intended\r\nto fortify the Bank of France and French investors against a possible\r\ncrisis due to their colossal holdings of Russian bonds. France is the\r\nguardian and watch dog of monetary Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile the situation in Germany is strained, that country is taking the\r\nlead in European manufacturing enterprises, and it is forcing its trade\r\nin all parts of the world. To its great expansion in industrial work,\r\nthe locking up of capital there, in industrial enterprises of all sorts,\r\nis chiefly due. Tempted by great expectations capitalists have invested\r\nin them very heavily, and induced by high rates of interest the banks,\r\nand other large money lenders, have loaned enormously on industrial\r\nsecurities for which there is at present little or no demand from\r\ninvestors, and this conversion of their resources from a cash or liquid\r\nform to a form much more fixed than they expected, has very largely\r\ncurtailed the supply of loanable funds to others, and caused or\r\naggravated the long existing monetary stringency in Berlin. Yet, strange\r\nto say, Germany uses very few bank checks. The German Government,\r\nhowever, is about to consider a plan for regulating their issue and use.\r\nEven the Government salaries, aggregating $211,344,000, or 888 million\r\nmarks, a year, are paid wholly in specie. Here we see 18 million dollars\r\na month withdrawn from circulation, to return slowly. This is almost as\r\nbad as our Sub-treasury system. No wonder Germany is pinched for money.\r\n\r\nOne indirect cause, hitherto overlooked, of the prolonged monetary\r\nstringency in Europe has been the absorption of gold by Egypt, India and\r\nChina, and it has been sufficient to largely neutralize the effect of\r\nthe increased gold product of South Africa, Australia, America and other\r\ncountries. India has desired gold of late years, instead of silver\r\nexclusively, as before, owing to the depreciation in value of the white\r\nmetal, and China has been secretly absorbing it for the same reason, and\r\nwith an ultimate view to placing that nation on a gold basis.\r\n\r\nEgypt, however, for several years has been largely buying gold with the\r\nproceeds of its large exports, which include a particularly fine quality\r\nof long staple cotton that commands a much higher price than ordinary\r\ncotton. This gold is extensively hoarded by the Egyptian capitalists\r\ninstead of being placed in the banks there, and entering into the\r\nmonetary circulation. The consequence is that it is lost sight of, and\r\nlost to the world outside, for Egypt is not only distrustful of banks,\r\nbut imports very little in comparison with what it exports. So it is\r\nenabled to keep what it gets in gold. This seems to me an answer to the\r\nquestion, “What becomes of the new gold?”\r\n\r\nThe world’s peace in the future is more likely to be disturbed on the\r\nPacific Ocean side than on the Mediterranean. I predict that within the\r\nnext few years all the great European nations will combine, in friendly\r\nrelations, offensive and defensive, against the balance of the world,\r\nwhich means against China, Japan and India, that represent two-thirds of\r\nthe world’s population. If the United States wants to stand aloof and\r\navoid being drawn in on one side or the other, the Philippines must be\r\nparted with. The contest of the European nations will be for commerce in\r\nthe East, and the European powers, especially Russia and Germany, will\r\ndo all they can to breed trouble between the United States and Japan and\r\nwould be glad to have both nations crippled through a war. So long as we\r\nhang on to the Philippines we will have a war cloud hanging over us.\r\nEngland, owing to her alliance with Japan, is in a better position to\r\ntake care of the Philippines than we are, and if we could make an\r\nhonorable deal with England to exchange them for her South American\r\npossessions, it would be a good thing for us, as, when the Panama Canal\r\nis built, those islands will be of much more advantage to us than the\r\nPhilippines, and by thus removing the bone of contention we would secure\r\npermanent peace. The Philippines will be a great source of expense to us\r\nwithout any possibility of obtaining corresponding advantages;\r\ntherefore, why retain what will keep a sore spot open as long as we hold\r\non? We are not a colonizing nation—we have territory enough of our own\r\nwithin our own border, while England, on account of her meagre\r\ndimensions, requires colonizing for self-existence.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that it may turn out to have been a mistake for\r\nCommodore Perry to have opened the ports of Japan to the world—a caged\r\nlion being safer than one let loose. It resulted in Japan building\r\nherself up as a power; then followed the war with China, which was\r\ninstrumental in breaking down China’s exclusive walled-in method of\r\nexistence. So that now China is also opened to the world like Japan; her\r\n350,000,000 of people will get themselves on a war protecting basis,\r\nwhich will naturally make an alliance with Japan a necessity, and such\r\nan alliance will after a while require the European combination as an\r\noffset; otherwise, sooner or later some of the European nations will be\r\napt to meet the same fate as old Rome at the hands of the\r\nbarbarians—simply wiped out of existence. China and Japan will fight for\r\ntheir self-preservation and commercial interests. The 300,000,000 in\r\nIndia will fight for release from Great Britain’s rule, and backed by\r\nfanatical inspiration, under skilled leadership, will make a dangerous\r\nfoe sometime. Hence India’s natural desires will make her akin to China\r\nand Japan, arrayed against any foreign foe. So India, China and Japan\r\nand the rest of the Orient, when well disciplined and well equipped and\r\nled by Japanese generals, will require the combined European nations to\r\nhold them in check. The European nations have now had all the wars they\r\nwant and they have gained through them their present forceful positions\r\nof independence, hence all future great wars will be to keep the\r\n900,000,000 of people in Asia in subjection, and it will need all their\r\ncombined power to do so.\r\n\r\nI will now come nearer home and glance at the rising star of the South.\r\n\r\nThe continued material prosperity of the South is one of the best signs\r\nof the times, and it has given a legitimate forward impulse to the whole\r\ncountry. This section of the United States is in its natural resources\r\nmore favored than any other, and presumably will ultimately become the\r\nrichest. That indeed is its natural destiny under the industrial and\r\nagricultural development which will come from the growth of population,\r\nthe consequent increase in the supply of labor and the progress of\r\neducation. Here, indeed, you have a splendid prospect where distance\r\nlends enchantment to the view, and in aiding, encouraging and\r\nstimulating this development, on good business principles, none will be\r\nable to render better service than you Southern bankers. Already the\r\nSouth is progressing in actual agricultural and industrial wealth from\r\nyear to year, and day to day, at a rate that would have seemed fabulous\r\nnot very long ago; and the banker shares with the farmer this rapidly\r\nincreasing prosperity, especially if cotton is selling at more than\r\nthirteen cents a pound, or even at ten cents. It is, therefore, to the\r\nbanker’s interest to co-operate with the farmer, for by so doing the\r\nbenefit becomes mutual. You gentlemen, as Southern bankers, are favored\r\nby Providence in being where you have such a wide and splendid field for\r\ndoing good to others on a safe and conservative basis, at the same time\r\nthat you are building up the South, and doing good for yourselves in the\r\ntime-honored business of banking.\r\n\r\nWhile the South is increasing rapidly in actual and substantial wealth,\r\nit is a good sign that this wealth is not going into a few hands, but\r\nbeing widely distributed among all grades of the population. The city,\r\nthe town, the village, the factory and the farm give equal and abundant\r\nevidence that all are sharing this boon of material prosperity,\r\nresulting from their own industry and the Southern country’s legitimate\r\ndevelopment. You have, figuratively speaking, only to tickle the soil\r\nwith a hoe, and it smiles with a harvest.\r\n\r\nThe South produced last year crops and other raw products valued at two\r\nthousand millions of dollars, or four hundred and fifty millions more\r\nthan all the United States, outside of the South produced in 1880; and\r\nlast year also its manufactured products were valued at two thousand\r\nfive hundred millions, or five times more than it manufactured in 1880.\r\nThis is the right kind of expansion.\r\n\r\nLast year, too, the increase in the assessed value of property in the\r\nSouth was eleven hundred millions, or three hundred and fifty millions\r\nmore than the increase between 1890 and 1900. Contrast the increase of\r\nseven hundred and sixty millions in that ten-year period with the\r\nincrease of over sixteen hundred millions in the last two years—1905 and\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nSuch growth is as phenomenal as it is gratifying, not only to the people\r\nof the South but to the people of the whole United States, and it is not\r\na forced but a natural growth. We see it most conspicuously in the\r\ndevelopment of its industries, for it has now two hundred and fifty\r\nmillions invested in cotton mills, an amount exceeding the capital\r\ninvested in cotton mills in all the United States in 1880. This alone is\r\na grand exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe South also is making pig iron at the rate of three million five\r\nhundred thousand tons a year, more than all the rest of the country made\r\nin the year 1880, and the capacity of the South for iron and steel\r\nmaking is practically unlimited. Turning to bituminous coal, the South\r\nmined eighty-five million tons of it last year, and in the last fiscal\r\nyear the foreign exports of all kinds from southern ports were valued at\r\nseven hundred and thirty-four millions against only about two hundred\r\nand fifty millions in 1881. The South may well be proud of all this\r\nproductiveness.\r\n\r\nSo great is this material development and so great the consequent demand\r\nfor transportation facilities, that every railway in the South may well\r\nneed double tracking, while to keep pace with the South’s present rate\r\nof progress, thousands of miles of new railways will have to be\r\nconstructed every year for many years to come. The South should\r\ntherefore continue to encourage capital no less than immigration, on a\r\nscale extensive enough to meet all its legitimate requirements. This is\r\nthe work, Gentlemen and Bankers of the South, that lies before you.\r\n\r\nNow I come to Kentucky; good old Kentucky—with which is linked the fame\r\nof Daniel Boone, and a Civil War record of which it may well be proud.\r\n\r\nWe in the North, of course, all know that Kentucky is famous for its\r\nbeautiful women, its handsome men, its splendid race horses of the great\r\nblue grass region, and the whiskey of which Colonel Watterson has told\r\nus so much and claims to be so fine a judge. His story of “Old Kentucky\r\nBourbon” is a dream of eloquence.\r\n\r\nBut first of all to engage our attention are the women, whose beauty is\r\nonly eclipsed by their charm of manner, their refinement and bright\r\nintelligence. They represent an aristocracy of the best blood of the\r\nAmerican people, and I can testify to their fascinations, for I won, or\r\nrather surrendered to, one of the finest of Kentucky’s daughters, after\r\nfor a long time supposing that my surrender was impossible even to the\r\nfairest of the fair; and therefore I am glad to come to Kentucky and to\r\nenjoy the privilege of addressing so many of its stalwart sons as are\r\ngathered in this distinguished assembly of Kentucky bankers, on the\r\ngeneral situation, after the financial storm we have passed through. I\r\nindeed almost feel, in the tender words of the popular song, that I have\r\nat length reached “My Old Kentucky Home.”\r\n\r\nAs a border State, you are claimed by both the South and the North, and\r\nyour hospitality makes visitors from every quarter believe that, no\r\nmatter where they hail from, Kentucky knows no North, no South, no East,\r\nno West, in the welcome she extends to strangers, or friends, from every\r\nsister State. When, in after life, these visitors sing the old song,\r\n“There’s no place like home,” they will mentally add, “except Kentucky.”\r\n\r\nI thank God that to-day we all know the United States as a United\r\nCountry now and forever, which during the present generation has grown,\r\nand is growing, more united, more liberal, in a broader sense, and each\r\nsection more just and generous in seeking to solve the problem of\r\ngranting equal rights to rich and poor alike.\r\n\r\nIn closing I desire to impress upon you that I shall always have in my\r\nheart a grateful appreciation of your kindness and courtesy in\r\npermitting me to meet and address you on this occasion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the close of this Address a motion was made that “Mr. Clews be\r\ntendered a vote of thanks by the members of the Convention for his very\r\nable, very interesting, and most instructive address.”\r\n\r\nThe President of the Association—who presided—said, “Those in favor of\r\nthe motion will please rise.” He then declared the vote to be unanimous.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING DATES OF ADMISSION OF THE MEMBERS OF\r\n                               THE\r\n\r\n                        NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\n           _According to the Directory Issued July 1, 1907._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrior to May 3, 1869, the New York Stock Exchange was a body with a\r\nmembership of 533.

Nathan, who was admitted to membership\r\non May 6, 1869.\r\n\r\nOn May 8, 1869, a consolidation was effected with an organization known\r\nas the “Open Board of Brokers,” at that time facetiously referred to as\r\nthe “Coal-holers,” from the fact that they had held their meetings for a\r\ntime in a basement in William Street.\r\n\r\nThis Open Board had a membership of 354, of whom there remain as members\r\nat the present time but 26, as appears by the following list:\r\n\r\n    L.

It appears, therefore, that of members who joined the\r\nExchange prior to the 1st of January, 1870, there at present remain 85,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n        Members of the original “New York Stock Exchange”    31\r\n          now remaining\r\n\r\n        Members of the “Government Bond Department” who      15\r\n          joined May 3, 1869\r\n\r\n        One member who joined the Exchange May 6, 1869        1\r\n\r\n        Members of the “Open Board of Brokers” who were      26\r\n          admitted May 8, 1869\r\n\r\n        Present members who joined between May 9, 1869 and    7\r\n          Jan. 1, 1870\r\n\r\n                                                             __\r\n\r\n                                                             80\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\n   ENGLAND AND RUSSIA IN OUR CIVIL WAR AND THE WAR\r\n                  BETWEEN RUSSIA AND JAPAN.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Written for the _North American Review_, June 1904 issue, by Henry\r\n  Clews.\r\n\r\nThere has recently been much discussion relative to the attitude of\r\nEngland and Russia towards the United States during our Civil War. This\r\nwas provoked by the war between Russia and Japan, which caused the\r\npartisans of Russia here to contend that Americans ought to sympathize\r\nwith Russia in the contest. They argued that Americans should do this\r\nbecause Japan has an alliance by treaty with England, and English\r\nsentiment was a good deal against the United States in our struggle, or\r\nrather in favor of the South as against the North, whereas Russia was on\r\nour side, and made us, in 1863, as they erroneously claim, an offer of\r\nnaval assistance in the event of intervention by England and France.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to assert, as it has long been asserted and by many\r\nbelieved, that Russia, in 1863, offered the United States Government the\r\nuse of her ships of war that then came to the port of New York, and that\r\nthis prevented, or may have prevented, England and France from\r\nrecognizing the independence of the Southern Confederacy. But we have\r\nyet to learn that there is any record of such an official overture by\r\nRussia, either at St. Petersburg or at Washington; and there certainly\r\nwould be one in both countries if the assertion was a fact instead of\r\nbeing wholly mythical.\r\n\r\nWould Lincoln or Seward have left the country in ignorance of such an\r\naffair, or of any suggestion in that direction, if it had been\r\nofficially made? It is a myth that hardly calls for contradiction. Such\r\nmatters between nations cannot be kept secret, and the lapse of forty\r\nyears since 1863 without revealing anything concerning the alleged\r\norders, goes to prove that there were none of the kind, and that there\r\nwas nothing to reveal. The Russian ships came here in 1863, just as the\r\nRussian fleet with the Grand-Duke Alexis came to New York in 1871,\r\nmerely on a cruise.\r\n\r\nThat sentiment in England during the war was largely pro-Southern among\r\nthe wealthy mercantile and manufacturing class is not to be disputed.\r\nBut this resulted from the interruption of the cotton supply by the war\r\nand the blockade of the Southern ports, and from the loss of the South\r\nas a customer for British manufactures, involving much depression and\r\ndistress. The shoe pinched very severely. Liverpool and Manchester, in\r\nparticular, were great sufferers by the war, and smarted under the\r\nextinction, for the time being, of their Southern cotton supply and\r\nconnections, and they were against the North largely because it had\r\nchoked off this trade.[8]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  I except, of course, the great excitement and commotion created in\r\n  England by the seizure of Mason and Slidell, on November 7th, 1861, by\r\n  Captain Wilkes of the U.S.S. “San Jacinto,” when the British\r\n  Government demanded their release and an apology; but that was because\r\n  we had violated the rights of a neutral vessel by taking them from the\r\n  “Trent,” flying a British flag. We released them on that ground, and\r\n  so at once ended the trouble that had threatened war. This was a\r\n  special case of our provoking.\r\n\r\nBut this sentiment, this irritation, due to business conditions growing\r\nout of the war, was merely personal, and in no way involved the British\r\nGovernment, or reflected its leanings, opinions, or future policy.\r\nLiverpool and Manchester were, not unnaturally, sentimentally against\r\nthe North, because it was, under the necessities of war, preventing the\r\nSouth from shipping its produce to England or importing British goods.\r\nThat feeling of irritability against the North would have disappeared at\r\nany time with the resumption of trade with the South; and it did\r\ndisappear as soon as the war ended and the Southern ports were reopened\r\nto commerce.\r\n\r\nEngland’s American trade up to that time had been very much larger with\r\nthe South than with the North, for cotton was much more truly “king”\r\nthen than it is now; and, apart from grain and provisions, the export\r\ntrade of the North was very small in comparison with its present great\r\nextent. Moreover, the wealth of the United States was small in\r\nproportion, and our social relations with England and the rest of Europe\r\nwere not nearly as intimate and extensive as they have since become. We\r\nhave learned to know each other much better in the interval.\r\n\r\nWe had not then begun to export beauty and fashion, largely in the shape\r\nof American heiresses, for the delight and enrichment of the aristocracy\r\nof the Old World, and we could boast of no such colossal individual\r\nfortunes as we can now.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the British Government did, on one occasion, consider the\r\nquestion of recognition of the South and intervention in the war, it was\r\nsolely on the proposition of the French Emperor, Napoleon the Third, who\r\nwanted to break up our Union in order to promote his scheme for planting\r\nthe Latin race in America, by establishing, under French protection, an\r\nempire in Mexico, with Maximilian on the throne. But his proposition was\r\nat once unanimously, emphatically and unconditionally rejected by the\r\nBritish Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWe have this on the highest official authority, that of Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself, who, in a letter to me dated May 30th, 1889, speaks thus\r\npositively on the subject:\r\n\r\n                                    26 JAMES’S STREET, May 30, 1889.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    Having expressed my interest in the portions of your work which\r\n    I read on the day of its arrival, I think it would be less than\r\n    ingenuous if I did not, after reading what relates to the\r\n    Cabinet of Lord Palmerston, on page 56 and in the following\r\n    chapter, make some reference to it.\r\n\r\n    Allow me to assure you that, so far as that Cabinet is\r\n    concerned, you have been entirely misled in regard to matters of\r\n    fact. As a member of it, and now nearly its sole surviving\r\n    member, I can state that it never at any time dealt with the\r\n    subject of recognizing the Southern States in your great civil\r\n    war, excepting when it learned that proposition of the Emperor\r\n    Napoleon Third, and declined to entertain that proposition\r\n    without qualification, hesitation, delay, or dissent.\r\n\r\n    In the debate which took place on Mr. Roebuck’s proposal for the\r\n    negotiation, Lord Russell took no part, and could take none, as\r\n    he was a member of the House of Lords. I spoke for the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    You will, I am sure, be glad to learn that there is no\r\n    foundation for a charge which, had it been true, might have\r\n    aided in keeping alive angry sentiments happily gone by. You\r\n    are, of course, at liberty to publish this letter.\r\n\r\n              I remain, dear sir, your very faithful servant,\r\n\r\n                                                    W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n    HENRY CLEWS, Esq.\r\n\r\nIn this letter it will be seen, Mr. Gladstone, the Grand Old Man, as\r\nEngland called him, a member of the British Cabinet during Lord\r\nPalmerston’s administration, which extended from 1859 to 1865, more than\r\ncovering the period of the war for the Union, assured me that the\r\nCabinet never at any time dealt with the subject of recognizing the\r\nSouthern States, except to decline to entertain the proposition of\r\nFrance, and this “without qualification, hesitation, delay, or dissent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could be more positive and emphatic than this? What more\r\nunequivocal, explicit and direct? It is an unqualified statement that\r\nthe British Government had never during the war in any way considered\r\nthe question of recognizing the Southern Confederacy, except on that one\r\noccasion, and England was the first nation to which the French proposal\r\nwas made. Had England joined France when Napoleon made his proposition,\r\nwhich she was the first to reject, that conspirator against us would\r\nhave tried hard to help the South to succeed in disrupting the Union,\r\nfor the purpose of regaining possession of Louisiana, and capturing as\r\nmuch additional territory as possible in order to annex it to the empire\r\nhe expected to found in Mexico. He wanted a weak neighbor. We were saved\r\nfrom his machinations, and this great danger, by the resolute course of\r\nthe British Government; and Napoleon thereafter sowed the wind to reap\r\nthe whirlwind in Mexico. He consigned poor Maximilian to disaster and an\r\ninglorious death, after his empire had fallen like a house of cards when\r\nthe French troops, that had bolstered up his throne, were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThis positive testimony from so high and competent an authority as Mr.\r\nGladstone ought to be conclusive in effectually disproving the unfounded\r\n“cock and bull” story that England, at one time, contemplated the\r\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy, and that she was prevented from\r\nmoving in that direction, and led to reverse her policy, and prevent the\r\nescape of the Confederate cruisers from Laird’s shipyard at Birkenhead,\r\nby the arrival at New York of Russian war-ships.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a Russian squadron, commanded by Admiral S. Lessoffsky on\r\nhis flagship “Alexander Nevsky,” did come to New York late in September,\r\n1863, and that its officers were very hospitably received and\r\nentertained, is the peg on which this story is made to hang. I have good\r\nreasons for saying the ships came here with no such object, nor with\r\n“sealed orders” to take an active part in the war, if required. New York\r\nwas merely a port of call for them, and no doubt their officers were\r\nglad to get here and be fêted, as they were. They also, it is safe to\r\nassume, appreciated the courtesy of William H. Seward, the Secretary of\r\nState, who afterwards told me that, when he heard of their arrival in\r\nAmerican waters, he invited them to accept the hospitalities of the port\r\nof New York. He, of course, foresaw that their coming here would, or at\r\nleast might, have a good moral and political effect in our favor both at\r\nhome and abroad, by depressing the South and encouraging the North, and\r\ncausing any foreign Powers that might have been considering the\r\nadvisability of recognizing the Southern Confederacy to postpone action\r\nunder the impression that we had, or might have, Russia for an ally.\r\n\r\nHe was astute enough to see that this visit of the Russian squadron\r\nmight seem to be what it was not, particularly to foreign eyes.\r\nAppearances, we all know, are often deceptive, yet they sometimes exert\r\ngreat influence. The visit of this squadron was a case in point. It was\r\na splendid “bluff,” at a very critical period in our history. Its coming\r\nwas all the more desired by Mr. Seward because, on the 3d of February,\r\n1863, he had received a despatch from the Emperor Napoleon offering to\r\nmediate between the United States and the Southern Confederacy, to which\r\nhe replied three days later, absolutely rejecting the offer, in very\r\npositive terms. After that, early in July, the battle of Gettysburg had\r\nbeen fought, and Northern prospects had brightened very materially.\r\nNevertheless, the coincidence of an arrival, about the same time as the\r\nAtlantic Squadron came, of more Russian war-ships at San Francisco,\r\nunder the command of Admiral Popoff, added to Secretary Seward’s\r\ngratification; and, when the Russian officers of the Atlantic Squadron\r\nwent on to Washington, he kept up the festivities to which they had been\r\naccustomed in New York by giving them a grand dinner. He was a fitting\r\nhost, as he had originally invited them to come here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grand-Duke Alexis when he came to New York, with another Russian\r\nsquadron, under another Admiral, in 1871, practically verified, in reply\r\nto my inquiries in conversation while I was acting as one of the Russian\r\nReception Committee, what Secretary Seward had previously intimated to\r\nme—namely, that there was no foundation for the story that the Russian\r\nsquadron of 1863 had come here to help us in warfare, if needed. Mr.\r\nSeward told me this very definitely on one occasion when I met him at\r\nWashington. But that its officers enjoyed themselves here very much\r\nsocially was evident from their profuse expression of thanks, and\r\nacknowledgment of obligations for the favors received, before they took\r\ntheir departure, and also from the fact that when they got back to\r\nRussia, they called in a body, with the Emperor’s approval, on Mr.\r\nCassius M. Clay, the American Minister at St. Petersburg, to return\r\nthanks more formally for the courtesies and kindness of which they had\r\nbeen the recipients here.\r\n\r\nNow, it is clearly to be inferred that, if they had come here to serve\r\nus at a grave crisis, by offering to take part in our war, they would\r\nnot have felt themselves under such obligations to us; on the contrary,\r\nwe should have been under very great obligations to them, which would\r\nhave called for public acknowledgment. Moreover, if the Russians had\r\ncome on any such mission as naval co-operation in actual war, if needed,\r\nit would not only have been a matter of official record in both\r\ncountries, but it would have immediately become known, not alone to the\r\npublic here, but to the world. It would have been simply impossible to\r\nkeep the news from the press; and the Government at Washington would\r\nhave had no object; no good purpose to serve, in concealing such an\r\nalliance, for alliance it would have been of great international\r\nimportance, and one which would have tended, still more than the\r\nactivity of our own navy, to show Europe and the South the hopelessness\r\nof the South’s struggle with the North. Russia was friendly to the\r\nUnited States, of course; but this friendship between the two countries\r\nwas very different from an offer, or a willingness, to help us by armed\r\nintervention in our favor. Russia has never intimated that she had any\r\nsuch intention; and, indeed, such intervention on her part would have\r\nbeen folly, as her navy was then very small after the destruction of the\r\nCrimean War, and would have been powerless against England or France.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, therefore, that the sympathy with Russia in its\r\npresent war with Japan, which many in the United States are endeavoring\r\nto stimulate on the strength of this Munchausen story of proffered\r\nwar-ships, is based on a mere assumption. Just as in the case of one of\r\nDickens’s characters, “Mrs. Harris,” there was “no such person,” so in\r\nthe case of this visit of Russian cruisers, there was no such offer of\r\nthese by Russia to the United States, nor any evidence of any intention\r\nto offer them by Russia. On the contrary, Prince Gortchakoff, the\r\nRussian Minister of Foreign Affairs, repeatedly said to our Minister at\r\nSt. Petersburg and in despatches to the Russian Minister at Washington,\r\nthat Russia greatly favored peace, and wished for its speedy return; but\r\nwould never take sides in the controversy between North and South.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to England, we have the word of William Ewart Gladstone that\r\nthe British Government was not unfriendly to us throughout our Civil\r\nWar, inasmuch as it was absolutely and entirely opposed to the\r\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy, and instantly and effectually\r\ncheckmated the French Emperor when he tried to make it swerve from its\r\nconsistent course of neutrality. Had the British Government been\r\nunfriendly, it would have jumped at this chance to join France in\r\nrecognition and intervention. “By their fruits ye shall know them.”\r\n\r\nThere is no reason in what I have said, however, for an anti-Russian and\r\npro-Japanese feeling in the United States, or an anti-American feeling\r\nin Russia; and it is much to be desired that friendly feeling towards\r\neach other should prevail in both countries, but not at the expense of\r\ntruth. Even Japan, while fighting Russia, is showing good-will and\r\ngenerosity towards Russian officers and men, and treating them with\r\nuncommon courtesy and consideration.\r\n\r\nMy only object in thus writing is to present the matters referred to,\r\ninvolving the relations of the United States with England, France and\r\nRussia during our Civil War, in a true and proper light, and so to\r\ncorrect prevailing misapprehensions. Russia’s course in Manchuria,\r\nhowever, by which she tightened, instead of releasing, her grip upon it,\r\nas she promised to do, sufficiently accounts for our lack of sympathy\r\nwith her in her war with Japan.\r\n\r\nWhile professing friendship for the United States, she has acted in bad\r\nfaith, and by her restrictions ruined our growing trade there; and all\r\nthe specious arguments put forward by Russia through the Russian\r\nAmbassador at Washington will not make the American people believe that\r\nRussian success in this war would be an advantage to the United States.\r\n\r\nHence, American sympathies are not generally on the side of autocratic\r\nand grasping Russia, with its closed door, but with liberal Japan, and\r\nits open door. Moreover, it is to be hoped that Russia will find her\r\nso-called “special position” of exclusiveness and monopoly in Manchuria\r\nuntenable, and be compelled to abandon it, to evacuate that country, and\r\nleave its trade open to all the world. Then the now idle and ruined\r\nfactories, built there by Americans, could be turned to profitable\r\naccount again.\r\n\r\nAlthough our relations with Russia have always been friendly, past\r\nfriendship does not justify present injustice. The retention of her\r\nfoothold in Manchuria, which she was to have held only until the country\r\nwas pacified, and her obvious and avowed designs upon Corea, evidently\r\naim at the acquisition of their territory, and point to similar ultimate\r\ndesigns upon China and Japan.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, we may well sympathize with Japan in her struggle\r\nwith Russia. We owe nothing to Russia because some of her ships came to\r\nNew York in 1863; but we are indebted to England for having peremptorily\r\ndeclined the proposition of France to recognize the Southern\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, England is our natural ally, as we are allied to her by an\r\naffinity of race, language, religion and free institutions. As for “the\r\nYellow Peril,” of which so much has been said, especially by the Russian\r\nAmbassador, as something to be feared by the Western nations, it is\r\npurely imaginary and chimerical. There is no more danger of China and\r\nJapan, if successful in war at home, invading and overrunning the rest\r\nof the world at any time in the future, near or remote, than there is of\r\nthe man in the moon coming down and invading us with an army of\r\nmoonshiners.\r\n\r\n                                                  August 11th, 1905.\r\n\r\n    EDITOR New York _Times_, New York City.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: My attention has been called to an editorial in your\r\n    issue of August 10th, entitled “That Gladstone Letter Again,”\r\n    the letter in question being the one received by me personally\r\n    from Mr. Gladstone. The editorial by its wording seems to bring\r\n    in question the authenticity and veracity of the statements\r\n    contained therein.\r\n\r\n    The letter came to me voluntarily from Mr. Gladstone, as the\r\n    result of an article written by me, and it should remove any\r\n    doubt as to the position of the British Cabinet in connection\r\n    with our Civil War. The utterances of some of the individual\r\n    members of the Cabinet did doubtless favor the South during a\r\n    part of our Civil War, but when Emperor Napoleon’s proposition\r\n    for intervention came up in the British Cabinet, the action\r\n    taken was exactly as Mr. Gladstone states in his letter to me,\r\n    and is borne out by Mr. Gladstone’s speech in the House of\r\n    Commons made soon afterwards, and it was largely due to his\r\n    speech that Mr. Roebuck’s motion on Napoleon’s proposition was\r\n    defeated.\r\n\r\n    There is an unwritten law in England that the deliberations of\r\n    the British Cabinet shall never be revealed by any member except\r\n    by consent of the Crown. Mr. Gladstone was known to be a great\r\n    stickler for conventions, and his letter to me in which he\r\n    expressly says I am at liberty to publish it could not have been\r\n    written except by consent of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n                                  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\n   THE CRISIS OF 1907 AND ITS CAUSES. WAS PRESIDENT\r\n                     ROOSEVELT TO BLAME?[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  An address to the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce, Cleveland, Ohio,\r\n  Tuesday evening, January 28th, 1908, by Henry Clews.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to meet the members of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of the city of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nNext to New York—being from New York I have to make this\r\ndistinction—next to New York, I consider Cleveland the home of the most\r\nworthy set of business men in the United States. Your forefathers chose\r\nwell when they elected to settle in this beautiful spot. The wisdom\r\nwhich they displayed is proven by the twenty miles of docks on your\r\nwater front and by the fact that your people own the largest tonnage on\r\nthe lakes.\r\n\r\nThe natural resources of your surroundings have made you masters of\r\ntrade in coal, iron, and petroleum. Your harbors are commodious, and\r\nwhat they lacked in natural formation you have supplied by the famous\r\nbreakwaters which have been built. Your city is not only a natural\r\nbusiness center, but also a railroad center.\r\n\r\nYour Euclid Avenue is spoken of in the East as a model to be copied by\r\nthe lovers of beauty.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago Cleveland was a village. If you continue to thrive as\r\nyou have, where will you be fifty years hence?\r\n\r\nIt was in the soil of Cleveland that the seed was planted that has grown\r\nand developed into the greatest business plant in the world. To-day the\r\nStandard Oil Company commands trade in every country on the face of the\r\nglobe, and as a body are the greatest merchants that the world has ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nOhio has robbed Virginia of the right to be known as “the mother of\r\nPresidents,” and I predict that the Republican Convention to be held\r\nthis summer will present as its candidate your most famous and honored\r\ncitizen, Hon. William H. Taft, who will be elected by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. I suggest that he and Mr. Roosevelt change places—Taft as\r\nPresident and Roosevelt as Secretary of War, or still better, Secretary\r\nof the Navy. Then we will be ever alertful and prepared for\r\neventualities both on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. In this way we\r\nwill retain the services of both.\r\n\r\nI will begin by saying that the elimination of the Godly Motto on our\r\ngold coin many people may think means-“In President Roosevelt we trust,\r\nbut in God we distrust”; but I am sure the great mass of the Americans\r\ndo not think that way. They believe in trusting both God and the\r\nPresident, and if the President will put back “God” on the American coin\r\nthey will put him back in the White House after his present term—thus\r\nmaking our Motto: God first, our Country second, Theodore Roosevelt\r\nthird (term). The Three together one and inseparable for the next four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that there is not an intelligent man in the United\r\nStates who sincerely questions the “honesty of Theodore Roosevelt’s\r\nmotives.” Whatever he has done he has done to promote the public good\r\nand the nation’s welfare, whether his speeches have helped to cause\r\ndistrust or not. He is an honest man, and an honest man is said to be\r\nthe noblest work of God. But, of course, as we cannot expect perfection\r\neven in honest men, they may sometimes make mistakes in their judgment\r\nof consequences, however good their intentions are. That we all allow\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nYou ask the question: Is President Roosevelt’s policy towards capital\r\nsound? In other words, has he, in denouncing and instigating the\r\nprosecution of law-breaking railway corporations, and industrial Trusts,\r\nmenaced the prosperity of the country? I contend that he has not. He\r\ncertainly had no intention to do so, for, while he was instrumental in\r\nturning on the light, he was not responsible for the abuses of power\r\nthat the light revealed, and it is the revelation of graft and illegal\r\nmethods, on the part of certain railway and other corporations, through\r\nthe acts of their responsible managers, and controlling capitalists,\r\nthat has undermined public confidence in many of them.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the marked change in conditions and public sentiment,\r\nespecially in the stock market,—from the great optimism, buoyancy and\r\nhigh prices of last year to the great depression and low prices of this\r\nyear of panics,—has caused many unthinking critics of the situation to\r\nascribe it to the influence of President Roosevelt. The speculative\r\ncapitalists and Trust magnates who have lost heavily by the depression\r\nin stocks have this impression of the effect of his policy and speeches\r\nin exposing corporate wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nBut it is an idea that needs to be controverted, or at least is open to\r\nquestion, and his course is generally approved by popular opinion all\r\nover the country. In other words the people generally are in favor of\r\nthe policy represented by all that the President has done to correct\r\ncorporate abuses and illegal methods and raise the standard of business\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nBefore entering further into the subject, however, I will say that\r\ngatherings of this kind, where the burning questions of the day are\r\ndiscussed in a frank and friendly way, are productive of good\r\nfellowship, and good results. Different minds view important events from\r\ndifferent standpoints, and any association that meets for this purpose\r\nwith a desire to obtain by mutual discussion, the fairest and best\r\nunderstanding relating to public measures, is doing a patriotic service,\r\nand is worthy of the highest commendation. It is particularly so at a\r\ntime like this, in view of the prevailing depression and distrust.\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate that a presidential election did not take place\r\nlast year, as the people were in such a state of uncertainty and\r\napprehension that many well-meaning men would not, I fear, have voted\r\nwith a desire for their country’s good, but be biased by personal\r\ninterest or a determination to obtain revenge for what they have lost by\r\nthe great and prolonged decline in the stock market and the disturbance\r\nof credits.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, greatly to be deplored that some of the men high in\r\ncommand in the industrial and railroad companies have abused the trust\r\nreposed in them and made it imperative for the President to instruct the\r\nattorneys of the national government to investigate their doings, and\r\nprosecute those corporations and their officers charged with using their\r\ncorporate powers to do illegal acts, like rebating, and such chicanery\r\nas that of the Chicago & Alton reorganization. The fact that, in nearly\r\nevery such instance of Government prosecution, the guilt of the parties\r\naccused has been proved on their trial, justifies President Roosevelt in\r\nhis action.\r\n\r\nWhile capital may continue timid until the whole truth is known and\r\nconfidence in corporate management restored, the agitation, will, in the\r\nend, prove beneficial to the country; for it will purify it by\r\neliminating the unlawful evils complained of. This will inspire foreign\r\ncapitalists as well as our own with confidence; and they will invest\r\nheavily in American securities, just as soon as they feel assured that\r\nthe surplus earnings of our railway and industrial companies will be\r\nfairly divided among the stockholders under honest management, regulated\r\nby law, and subject to Federal and State supervision.\r\n\r\nRecent events have shown that drastic action was necessary to insure a\r\nsquare deal for all. Mr. Roosevelt is not attacking capital, but he is\r\nattacking those in control of corporations who have misused their power\r\nand position to do illegal acts and presumably for their personal\r\nprofit. Confidence received blow after blow from this source, before\r\ngetting another rude shock through the exposures resulting from the\r\nMetropolitan Securities investigation, and the action of the New York\r\nClearing House with regard to the Heinze and Morse banks.\r\n\r\nIt is now over two years since public disclosures of this kind as well\r\nas of railway rebating began, followed by the collapse of the copper\r\nmanipulation and, very recently, by the scandals connected with the New\r\nYork Traction situation. No wonder, therefore, that confidence is\r\nseriously disturbed. And who is responsible? Not President Roosevelt and\r\nMr. Hughes, the famous life insurance investigator, who have been\r\ninstruments of exposure, but the individuals who conceived and conducted\r\nthese unlawful operations. Of course the guilty protest against\r\nfinancial house cleaning; and they endeavor to ward off official\r\ninvestigations on the plea that these disturb confidence, and make the\r\ninnocent suffer. But the whole responsibility should be placed where it\r\nbelongs—upon the perpetrators of misdeeds, and not upon those who, in\r\nthe discharge of the duties of their high office, have been the means of\r\nturning on the light and preventing future operations of the kind. Those\r\nwho have trifled with the public interest, and displayed a blind\r\ndisregard of the people’s rights, are the real transgressors.\r\n\r\nIt becomes daily more evident that when all our railway and industrial\r\ncorporations are known to be honestly managed, and when stockholders and\r\ninvestors get their due, values will be more stable, and American\r\ncredit, which is now at a low ebb in all the great financial centers of\r\nthe world, will be restored to its rightful place.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these disclosures of illegal methods and wholesale graft\r\nthere is one gleam of encouragement, and that is, that public opinion is\r\naroused and will insist upon clean as well as capable corporate\r\nmanagement in the future, and thus these disclosures will result in the\r\nraising of the moral standard of corporate management. Meanwhile, the\r\npublic is disturbed by these revelations, and wonders what financial\r\nirregularity will be brought to light next. The action of many corporate\r\nmanagers has seemed to indicate that they think little of violating the\r\nlaws, and that, if they are broken by one high in authority, or in\r\nsocial life, immunity must be granted; or some subordinate be made to\r\nsuffer instead of themselves. If a poor man commits a crime, he is sent\r\nto jail. Sympathy for his family may sometimes make the judge lenient as\r\nto the time of his incarceration, but, however short the term, it\r\ngenerally brings sorrow and want to the family for which he is the sole\r\nprovider. Thus, the innocent have to suffer with the guilty in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn corporate matters, if a manager or controlling capitalist breaks the\r\nlaw, justice should punish him, as it would anyone else. The law should\r\nbe no respecter of persons.\r\n\r\nSodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because the people broke Nature’s\r\nlaws; and this government, although the best known to man, would be\r\ndestroyed in the course of time, if the rich and unscrupulous were\r\npermitted to break the laws with impunity, while the poor were punished\r\nfor much less serious offenses. This invidious distinction has caused\r\nthose who have suffered by the corrupt and illegal practices of\r\ncorporations and their managers to unload their grievances upon the\r\nPresident. In their communications they tell him that, while many from\r\ntheir ranks are being sent to prison, they fail to see any of the rich\r\nbeing sent there, although the evidence against them is unquestionable.\r\nThis unjust distinction, if it continues, I repeat, cannot fail to have\r\nan unsettling effect upon the American people, and may finally result in\r\nsomething more, as this is a government of the people, for the people\r\nand by the people, and a discrimination in favor of the wealthy—whether\r\ncorporations or individuals—will not be very long permitted by the plain\r\npeople, who are largely in the majority.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt took the oath at his inauguration to be guided by\r\nthe Constitution, and as the Constitution requires that the Executive of\r\nthe nation shall enforce the laws, he would have been derelict in his\r\nduty and unfaithful to his oath if he had not taken the action he has,\r\nto compel corporations to conform to the Interstate Commerce and Sherman\r\nAnti-Trust laws and their amendments. Whenever evidence has reached him,\r\nthrough the complaints of people who have suffered in consequence of the\r\nviolation of these laws, he has very properly handed the material\r\nreceived over to the Attorney General to make the necessary\r\ninvestigation, and as in every case thus prosecuted the results have\r\njustified all he has done as to these, he deserves great credit. The\r\nso-called indiscriminate attacks that are claimed to have been made by\r\nhim upon corporations and business interests have no sound basis. So far\r\nas his intentions go, he has only attacked dishonesty and law-breaking.\r\nWhile I fully approve of what Mr. Roosevelt has done in the way of\r\nreform, I confess I do not fully approve of his too oft repeated\r\npassionate utterances on the subject during the recent period of\r\ndistrust. It undoubtedly has helped to unsettle the minds of timid\r\ninvestors and weak-minded depositors. The President has probably been a\r\nlittle too outspoken at a time when silence would have been golden.\r\nThere are periods when the least said the better; still, I applaud his\r\ngood intentions and his excellent deeds, which cannot fail to prove\r\nfruitful in the end. We should all be willing, therefore, to overlook\r\nhis recent volubility and frequent reiterations.\r\n\r\nA short time ago France stood ready to invest large sums in American\r\nbonds and stocks. But just after her first venture in Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad bonds our corporation scandals filled the air with their\r\nunpleasant odor and French capital was locked at once against everything\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nWhen all the old evils have been exposed, and wrongs righted, and\r\nforeign as well as home investors again seek investments for their funds\r\nin our securities, we may rest assured that, having undergone rigid\r\ninvestigation, they will be looked upon as the best in the world.\r\n\r\nThat President Roosevelt should be blamed in any way for the banking\r\ntroubles, business failures and losses that have been made in the stock\r\nmarket is unfair; but it is always the case that the Executive in office\r\nbears the brunt of whatever disasters of the kind occur during his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThose of us whose hair is no longer black, brown, sandy or red,—or very\r\nabundant,—can well remember the calumny and evil reports that were\r\nheaped upon the broad shoulders of the well beloved Abraham Lincoln. The\r\nnoble cause he fought for cost millions of lives and billions of\r\ndollars, and of course there were very many who suffered at that time by\r\nthe war. Of these many were most bitter in their denunciation of\r\nPresident Lincoln, and this nearly broke the heart of that great man,\r\nbut did not for a moment cause him to desist in the work he saw it was\r\nhis duty to perform to the end. To-day, those who traduced him join\r\nfreely with the whole nation in doing honor to his memory. President\r\nRoosevelt may be severe in the frankness with which he reiterates his\r\nintention to punish those who break the law; but, in the distant future,\r\nthe world at large will remember him as one who dared to suffer under\r\nunjust denunciation for the sake of right, and even now the great mass\r\nof the people are with him in his efforts to improve and purify business\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThose capitalists who have lost money largely by this year’s decline in\r\nprices of stocks, and the monetary disturbance, are naturally bitter and\r\nresentful; but even the majority of such, down in their hearts, grant\r\nthat in principle President Roosevelt is doing his plain duty, though in\r\nhis speeches he may have said too much too often. If what he has done is\r\nwrong, it is the fault of the law, for he has urged no greater\r\npunishment than the enforcement of the law. But the man would be daring,\r\nindeed, in the face of the exposures already noted, who would presume to\r\nsay that the law is unjust. It aims at equal justice for all, and we are\r\na law abiding people.\r\n\r\nIn view of all the wrong doing in corporation management it must not,\r\nhowever, be forgotten that the majority of our corporations are ably and\r\nhonestly managed in the interest of the stockholders. It is not\r\nsurprising that black sheep have crept into some of them, for a certain\r\npercentage of people in every walk of life and every association, church\r\nor social club, are bad at heart, and show up in their true colors, when\r\nsubjected to the temptation to commit wrongs which will tend to their\r\npersonal advantage. The assumption that now prevails, that all\r\ncorporation management is dishonest, is, therefore, unjust and has been\r\ncausing much of the hysteria that has prevailed in Wall Street and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo protect minority stockholders, especially in the Interstate\r\nRailroads, they should have at least one representative in the board of\r\ndirectors, and he should be elected by the minority at each annual\r\nmeeting. If such a director was a cool-headed, honest business man,\r\ncertain abuses, which have been prevalent in the past, could not have\r\noccurred and would be prevented in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that to aid personal schemes, some of the men\r\nin power, even in some of our large National Banks, have resorted to\r\nmethods which have caused loss of confidence in them, which resulted in\r\ntheir retirement, practically under compulsion, as officers and\r\ndirectors. It is almost needless to say that, of all corporations, our\r\nNational Banks should be the last to be used for illegal purposes, or to\r\npromote personal gain or speculations.\r\n\r\nWhen a man in power imperils the solvency and good reputation of one of\r\nour banks, he is a public enemy, and as mean and guilty as one who\r\nattacks the virtue of a virtuous woman. To destroy confidence in that\r\nwoman and her good name is to do her an irreparable wrong. Destroy\r\nconfidence in a bank and you destroy that which is one of the\r\ncorner-stones of business prosperity. Those who invest in railroad\r\nstocks, or stocks of Industrial corporations, risk only the cost of\r\ntheir investment, but the holder of record of a National Bank stock is\r\nliable for an additional amount equal to the par value of his holdings.\r\n\r\nPublicity is the greatest safeguard of the prosperity of any corporate\r\nenterprise, and the best preventive of irregularities and frauds. Many\r\nmen will do in secret what they would fear and refuse to do under the\r\npublic eye; and if hitherto secret ways are, in the future, made known,\r\nand seen of all men, there will be less breaking and unfaithfulness\r\namong many classes of business men in high places.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of publicity I have preached for years, and it was the\r\ntopic of an address I delivered before the Wharton School of Political\r\nEconomy in the University of Pennsylvania eighteen months ago. I saw\r\nthen what was going on in corporate corruption and grafting, and\r\nrailroad rebating, but, of course, had no tangible evidence or legal\r\nproof of these misdoings.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervening time, however, so much of this came to light that\r\nthere was no alternative for the national government, as well as many of\r\nthe states, but to take drastic action to stop these evils, and probe\r\nright and left to locate and convict those responsible for them.\r\nPresident Roosevelt led the way to this laudable end. He is not in favor\r\nof persecution, however; but he is in favor of the prosecution of those\r\nknown to be guilty; and I firmly believe that his courageous stand in\r\nthis movement to correct and punish corporate abuses will overshadow, in\r\nthe history of his Presidency, all his other achievements.\r\n\r\nRemember: he would punish only the guilty and protect property interests\r\nin every way possible, so that the innocent may not suffer with the\r\nguilty, or at least suffer as little as possible.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers engaged to defend wealthy corporate wrongdoers may sometimes\r\nprevent their conviction and punishment; but the people are entitled to\r\nthe protection which comes from an equal administration of justice.\r\n\r\nIn these days the truth of the biblical saying, that “the wicked\r\nflourish like a green bay tree, but they shall be cut down,” has become\r\nevident to us in certain instances applicable to corporations.\r\n\r\nSome ancient cities and empires, including the great Roman Empire, were\r\nruined by the lawlessness and unscrupulousness of their rich men—the\r\ngreat oppressors of those days—and our America was fast falling too much\r\nunder control of large corporations and corporation capitalists; but,\r\nthe plain people of this country are for equality, equal rights, and\r\nfair play for all, and opposed to a plutocracy.\r\n\r\nIn his address at Memphis, this year, President Roosevelt said:\r\n\r\n“I will no more stay my hand because a wrongdoer masquerades as a labor\r\nleader than if he masquerades as a captain of industry.\r\n\r\n“I am against undesirable citizens when they are great capitalists who\r\nwin a fortune by chicanery and when they are men who, under the guise of\r\nstanding for labor, preach and encourage violence and murder.”\r\n\r\nTo show that he recognized the sensitiveness of certain corporation\r\ncapitalists who are cast into a frenzy by his most common sense remarks,\r\nhe once said: “It has come to a point where my saying that honesty is\r\nthe best policy is liable to lead to a run on the banks.”\r\n\r\nIn discussing the cause of the present panicky contraction and\r\ndisturbance in the business and financial world, nothing, however, could\r\nbe further from the truth than to charge it all to the great corporation\r\nexposures and prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThere were many other things that contributed to bring about this year’s\r\ndepression and disturbance, and to cast over the brightest sky that ever\r\nshone the heavy clouds of distrust, reaction, and panic.\r\n\r\nThe clouds in the financial sky can remotely be attributed in a large\r\nmeasure to the effect of the tremendous railroad, industrial and\r\ncommercial development of the last ten years, which brought about\r\ncapital requirements in excess of the ability of the country to supply\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNaturally and necessarily, this resulted in precautionary steps being\r\ntaken by bankers and others to limit demands that capital could not\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThis conservatism and consequent contraction of the overwhelming volume\r\nof business, will, it is believed, prove the strongest force in averting\r\nfurther trouble and disaster. I have for some time been urging the\r\napplication of this brake, or safety valve, of conservatism, and it is\r\nreally imperative.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to meet the demands of the enormous business offered them,\r\nthe great railway and industrial corporations sought to enlarge their\r\nequipment at vast expense. In this they acted unwisely. They overtraded.\r\nTo use a common saying, “they bit off more than they could chew.” It\r\nwas, perhaps, excusable, not very long ago, when confidence was in its\r\nzenith and credit superabundant, to attempt the financing of mammoth\r\nundertakings. But unexpectedly and like a bolt out of a clear sky, came\r\nthe startling insurance and other exposures, and gradually timidity took\r\nthe place of confidence. Then capital, which is always more timid than\r\nusual at such times, began to contract, and many railway and industrial\r\ncorporations found themselves unable to borrow the large sums needed to\r\nmeet their extraordinary expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe banks in many instances, having already over-extended credits, were\r\nunable to provide the necessary funds, and new securities, owing to\r\nexcessive supplies and other causes, ceased to find the ready market\r\nthat they had enjoyed for so long a period. Investors took wing.\r\nCurtailment, therefore, in every direction became a necessity, so\r\nPresident Roosevelt can no more be blamed for the existing depression\r\nand panicky disturbance than he can be credited with all the great\r\nprosperity that preceded the crisis.\r\n\r\nThat this reaction, culminating in a panic so severe, came just at the\r\ntime it did, is largely if not wholly coincidental. It cannot be denied,\r\nhowever, that the startling disclosures of wholesale wrongdoing on the\r\npart of many of the great railway and industrial corporations disturbed\r\nthe confidence of the public to the core and paved the way to it.\r\n\r\nThe indictment and prosecution of the rich and powerful corporations\r\nthat had been violators of the law were but the necessary and legal\r\nconsequences of their own guilty conduct.\r\n\r\nArticle II, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States requires\r\nthat before he enters on the execution of his office the President shall\r\ntake the following oath: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully\r\nexecute the office of the President of the United States, and will to\r\nthe best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.”\r\n\r\nSection 3 of the same Article of the Constitution, in enumerating the\r\nduties of the President, says: “That he shall take care that the laws\r\nshall be faithfully executed.”\r\n\r\nAs at the time of his inauguration as President of the United States,\r\nTheodore Roosevelt solemnly swore that he would faithfully execute its\r\nlaws, all of you, I know, will agree with me when I assert that he was\r\nbound to loyally and fearlessly keep that oath.\r\n\r\nAs an honest man, he has only tried to do his duty. He has attacked the\r\nlaw-breaking corporations, and those in control who have amassed large\r\nfortunes out of them dishonestly, and these only. Not to have prosecuted\r\nand to have let these corporations, and their officers, go on, unchecked\r\nand unpunished, would have been to violate his oath of office and to\r\nneglect the duty imposed upon him.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly make a farce of this great republic, and cast a\r\nstigma upon our integrity, if the laws of the land were not enforced\r\nagainst the rich and the poor alike! No such reflection as that upon our\r\nnational honor will ever be tolerated by Theodore Roosevelt! He has been\r\nready at all times to uphold the national honor. It has been well said\r\nthat the honor of the nation is the soul of the nation.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt’s resolute and unyielding stand for the rights of\r\nthe people, against the powerful corporate wrongdoers who had thrived so\r\nlong upon their secret misdeeds, has commanded the attention and\r\nadmiration of the world. His excess of earnestness and denunciation at\r\ntimes, we can forgive.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo, in speaking of one of the world’s greatest “Immortals,”\r\ntruly said: “When a man is a glory in the face of his nation, that\r\nnation which does not perceive the fact astounds the human race around.”\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt has proved himself a successful crusader against\r\nsuccessful corporate dishonesty, involving violations of law; and it is\r\ndoubtful, as he says, whether his policies have had any material\r\ninfluence in bringing about the severe depression and banking crisis of\r\nthis memorable year. But whether they have or not, he declares, with the\r\ncourage of his convictions, that during the remainder of his term he\r\nwill not swerve from these policies, but persevere in them\r\nunflinchingly. Yet all that his administration has done has been to\r\nunearth the wrongdoing. It is impossible to cut out a cancer without\r\nmaking the patient feel temporarily worse than before.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake, or a slander, to say that Theodore Roosevelt has made\r\nwar against capital. He is only opposed to dishonest corporate methods,\r\nand dishonestly acquired wealth. He respects the possessors of honorably\r\nacquired and honestly used fortunes, and would protect their property\r\ninterests in every way possible, and guard them against injustice, and\r\nbe resolute in defending their rights; for their success leads to the\r\ninference that they are good citizens. But he will assuredly stand\r\nagainst crimes of unscrupulous cunning in the management of railway,\r\nindustrial or financial corporations as resolutely as he would against\r\ncrimes of brutal violence, and equally punish the rich man and the poor\r\nman, for crime is crime whether committed by a plutocracy or capitalist,\r\na poor wage earner, or a mob. These are his avowed principles and\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nHe would regard a man who builds a railway where it is needed, and\r\noperates it fairly and honestly, as a public benefactor; but if that man\r\nmanipulated the stock and bonds of that railway so as to swindle the\r\nstockholders or bondholders, or the public, or gave rebates or otherwise\r\nfavored one shipper over another, he would regard that man as an enemy\r\nof our institutions who should be punished for his wrongdoing. All this\r\ngoes to answer the question: Is President Roosevelt’s policy towards\r\ncapital sound? I say that it is, when rightly understood!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the regulation of corporations by the Federal Government\r\nshould be made absolute, and taken away from the States, where they do\r\nan Interstate business, like the railways and express companies. This\r\nwould be better for the corporations, themselves, as well as the people\r\nthan present conditions. They should be placed under National control,\r\njust as the National Banks are.\r\n\r\nThis central undivided control would do away with the confusion of\r\nFederal and State authority now existing. Moreover, I would favor the\r\nextension of this Federal control to all interstate corporations, and it\r\nwill come in time. Meanwhile President Roosevelt is paving the way for\r\nit, and to him let us give all honor for his long step in the right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBut, now that Mr. Roosevelt has substantially achieved his purpose, he\r\ncan well afford to rest satisfied that his work will continue to bear\r\ngood fruit without any further public addresses on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe people are already familiar with his views, and their continued\r\nreiteration by him in his speeches, especially during this period of\r\nfinancial and industrial distrust, depression and unsettlement, would\r\ntend to inspire fresh uneasiness as to the situation and the value of\r\ncorporate stocks and bonds. It would do this, owing to the extreme\r\nnervousness and timidity of capital that prevails.\r\n\r\nIt is this abnormally sensitive and apprehensive condition of public\r\nfeeling that led to the recent senseless run upon certain New York trust\r\ncompanies, and in a minor degree upon banks and savings banks, and that\r\ncaused very many of the depositors, after withdrawing their money, to\r\nhoard it in safe deposit vaults, and various less safe receptacles,\r\ninstead of depositing it in other institutions.\r\n\r\nTheir hoarding it, naturally made conditions all the worse, through very\r\nseriously increasing the stringency of the money market. So great became\r\nthe scarcity of loanable funds that from the 23d to the 31st of October,\r\ncall loans were made daily on the New York Stock Exchange at rates\r\naveraging 50 per cent per annum, with some ranging from 75 to 100 per\r\ncent. Such hoarding, on a large scale, is fraught with great danger, as\r\nit involves a sudden contraction of the circulation and drain upon bank\r\nreserves. In this instance it caused renewed panic and fresh breaks in\r\nstocks, and it alone compelled the New York Bank Clearing House members\r\nto vote unanimously to issue Clearing House Certificates—nothing else\r\nwould have offset the run on deposit institutions.\r\n\r\nIt would be very far from President Roosevelt’s wish to say or do\r\nanything that would cause people to hoard money instead of employing it\r\nin customary channels; for hoarding is a public injury and contrary to\r\ngood citizenship. Furthermore, it is entirely un-American. But the\r\npublic mind has been wrought up to such a pitch of distrust and\r\nsemi-hysteria, through the disclosures of corporate dishonesty, and\r\nother disturbing causes, that a false, or at least exaggerated,\r\nimpression exists among many that all corporations are, or may be, in\r\nthe same boat. This want of confidence in the situation is very largely\r\nwhat has caused the heavy and prolonged liquidation in stocks, and led\r\nto the bank and trust company runs and great monetary and industrial\r\ndisturbance we have witnessed in this great and far-reaching crisis.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt will, therefore, see, now that he is becoming more and\r\nmore cognizant of the situation, that what the public, and particularly\r\nthe investing class, needs in this period of stress and storm and\r\nanxiety, is to be calmed and reassured and made aware that there is a\r\nsilver lining to the cloud, and no good reason for their loss of\r\nconfidence; for the country is still as great and grand, and prolific in\r\nits resources, as ever, with its future no less promising and\r\nmagnificent than it was before this crisis darkened the sky.\r\n\r\nIt is known that he takes this view of the situation, and is earnestly\r\nco-operating with the Secretary of the Treasury to ease the money market\r\nand restore confidence.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\n OUR GREAT AMERICAN PANICS FROM FIRST TO LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1907 naturally revived public interest in all our previous\r\npanics, and therefore a brief historical review of these is timely. The\r\nsmall one that followed the throwing overboard of the historic tea in\r\nBoston harbor in George the Third’s time, and which was the prelude to\r\nthe War of Independence—the victorious struggle of the old Thirteen\r\nColonies to throw off the British yoke—was of no importance, owing to\r\nthe country’s scanty trade and banking development, and the\r\ncorresponding scarcity of credits. It was a tempest in a teapot, this\r\nsequel to the Boston tea party.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1812 was the first of much magnitude in the history of the\r\nUnited States, and it resulted from over-trading and undue expansion in\r\nall directions, but was precipitated by our war with England in that\r\nyear. The banking capital of the country was then only seventy millions\r\nof dollars, yet more than ninety banks failed in the run upon their\r\ndeposits that ensued, and the Government found great difficulty in\r\nraising a war loan. Meanwhile, trade and manufactures, which had been\r\nvery active and prosperous before the declaration of war, suddenly\r\nbecame almost paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe change from undue inflation to the undue contraction born of fear\r\nwas disastrous in its wholesale destruction of market values and\r\ncredits. But the Government war expenditures, after it had succeeded in\r\ndisposing of its securities, gradually stimulated recovery from the\r\nworst effects of the panic, and industries that had been suspended were\r\nresumed, thus re-employing labor that had been left idle.\r\n\r\nNot much has been recorded of the panic of 1823, which caused trade\r\ndepression till 1825, so it was evidently much milder and less\r\ndisastrous than that of 1812. It was another instance of the reaction\r\nthat follows over-trading and an over-extension of credits, without any\r\nwar or other great event to precipitate it.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1837 was, however, much more serious and disastrous,\r\nbecause it involved far greater results owing to the growth of the\r\nUnited States in extent, population, and wealth in the interval. like\r\nits predecessor, and indeed all other panics, it was due to the\r\nover-extension of trade, speculation and credits, but it was\r\nprecipitated by the troubles of the United States Bank, and President\r\nJackson’s hostility to that institution.\r\n\r\nSpeculation had been running wild, particularly in land and new railway\r\nprojects, which were then in their infancy in England. The achievements\r\nof George Stephenson, the builder of the first locomotive engine there,\r\nhad quickly kindled the fire of railway enterprise in this country, and\r\npromoters busied themselves in raising capital for building and\r\nequipping railways here; and incidentally it gave a strong impulse to\r\nthe widely prevailing speculation in land.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1857 was, of course, infinitely greater in its extent and\r\nconsequences than that of 1837, owing to the same causes that made the\r\nlatter greater than that of 1812, namely, the growth of the territory,\r\npopulation, and wealth of the United States. Its main cause can be\r\ntraced to the enormous increase of speculative enterprise in this\r\ncountry, especially in railway building, following the great gold\r\ndiscoveries of 1849 in California. But its immediate cause was the\r\ngeneral alarm produced by the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust\r\nCompany, which had its principal agency in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThere, at the corner of Nassau Street, it had long been regarded as a\r\npillar of financial strength, and no institution in the United States\r\nstood in higher credit or commanded greater confidence, although without\r\nany good reason. When it suspended payment, the news came upon the\r\npublic with the suddenness of a thunderbolt from a clear sky. The\r\nunexpected shock filled the financial and mercantile community with\r\ndismay, and from one end of the country to the other credit was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was panic. Bank-notes were everywhere distrusted, and\r\npresented for redemption; whereupon the banks everywhere suspended\r\nspecie payment, except that the Chemical Bank of New York redeemed its\r\nown notes. Business depression and thousands of failures from Maine to\r\nCalifornia followed, and nearly three fourths of the railways, and other\r\nlarge corporations, defaulted in their interest and other payments, and\r\nwent into the hands of receivers. The depression grew deeper from month\r\nto month for more than a year after the panic, and some of the best\r\nrailway stocks declined to $3 to $5 a share, including Michigan Southern\r\nand Harlem. Meanwhile corporate foreclosure sales and reorganizations\r\ntold the story of the financial wreckage of the time.\r\n\r\nThe country had not long recovered from the effects of this great panic\r\nwhen, on the 4th of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President, and\r\nthe Civil War broke out. There was severe depression—a war crisis—then,\r\nbut it was so slow, insidious, and prolonged that it was never called a\r\npanic. It may be said to have commenced—in anticipation of the\r\nthreatened war of the South against the North—with Lincoln’s election in\r\nNovember, 1860, and to have continued till the Government began to issue\r\nthe paper money of the war era in 1861, after the suspension of specie\r\npayments.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the panic of 1857, and the prolonged depression that\r\nfollowed it, duplicated the experience of 1837, and that was the almost\r\nuniversal prevalence of what were called “shinplasters.” These were\r\npractically I O Us given as change by anyone who had received a\r\nbank-note or check for more than the amount due him in payment for\r\nanything. In New York the notes of solvent New York banks were never\r\nrefused in payment, while those of banks elsewhere were tabooed; but in\r\nmaking change, no specie was given, the banks having suspended specie\r\npayments. So, unless the exact amount was tendered, shinplasters were\r\ngiven for the balance.\r\n\r\nThe city was flooded with these personal evidences of debt for small\r\namounts, issued by storekeepers, hotels, restaurants, saloons, barbers,\r\nand the rest of mankind, and many of these were passed from hand to hand\r\ntill they became too dirty and dilapidated to be handled. They were the\r\nworst kind of filthy lucre, and understood to be only redeemable on a\r\nreturn to cash payments by the banks. But of course many of them never\r\nwere redeemed. They ranged in amount from one cent to several dollars,\r\nand this sort of scrip was more or less extensively issued from Maine to\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe Black Friday Gold Panic was a Wall Street convulsion, and not far\r\nreaching, like the others. It occurred on Friday, September 24, 1869,\r\nand was the result of a conspiracy, headed by Jay Gould, to corner gold,\r\nand force the “shorts” and importers to buy at a high premium. The Tenth\r\nNational Bank, in Nassau Street, which he, and those associated with\r\nhim, managed to control, became conspicuously involved in the corner\r\nthrough over-certifying their checks to the amount of about $7,500,000\r\non that day, and, as a result, it was closed by the Government bank\r\nexaminer. Several scandals cropped out in connection with this\r\nconspiracy to corner gold, one of which involved the resignation of the\r\nNew York Assistant Treasurer, and another two brokerage firms employed\r\nby the gold cornerers to buy and receive their gold. Gold, after being\r\nbid up by the conspirators day by day from 119½ to 162¼, broke thirty\r\nper cent on the announcement that the Government would sell five\r\nmillions of gold. This was followed by the suspension of the Gold\r\nClearing House Bank, and the Stock Exchange was also closed to check the\r\npanic in stocks that ensued. While not a commercial panic, Black Friday\r\nwas very disastrous to many in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nNext came the tremendous panic of 1873, which, commencing in Wall\r\nStreet, on September 13, with the failure of several prominent banking\r\nand brokerage firms, including Howes & Macy, Kenyon Cox & Co. (in which\r\nDaniel Drew was a special partner), Fisk & Hatch, and then Jay Cooke &\r\nCo., rapidly spread, and soon covered the entire country. Many other\r\nfailures followed these from day to day, and crowds of sightseers\r\nbesieged Wall Street from morning till night, while the Stock Exchange\r\nwas closed, and remained closed for ten days to prevent the sacrifice of\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the distress that prevailed may be inferred from the\r\nfact that on the 19th of September twenty-two Stock Exchange firms\r\nsuspended payment. Rumors of bank and trust company troubles flew thick\r\nand fast, and there was a heavy run on their deposits, while the Union\r\nTrust Company was temporarily forced to close in order to raise money on\r\nits assets to meet the run upon it. Several banks were known to be\r\nunable to stand the general run any longer, when, on the evening of\r\nSeptember 20th, the New York Clearing House resolved to issue\r\n$10,000,000 of Clearing House loan certificates, in accordance with the\r\nresolution adopted to meet the crisis of 1860-61. It was on the same\r\ndate that the Stock Exchange was closed by its governing committee.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September an additional issue of $10,000,000 of\r\ncertificates was authorized, and on the 27th, so great and widespread\r\nhad the panic become that all restrictions upon their issue were\r\nremoved. The banks, instead of paying checks in cash, except for small\r\nsums, to depositors, certified them, payable through the Clearing House,\r\nand the weekly bank statement of the Association was suspended on\r\nSeptember 27th, and not resumed till December 28th. The amount of\r\nClearing House loan certificates attained its maximum—$22,400,000—on\r\nOctober 20th. In the interval business was resumed on the New York Stock\r\nExchange on September 30th, after its ten days of suspension. While it\r\nremained closed there was a curb market on Broad Street for stocks and\r\nbonds, but sales for cash there could only be made at panic prices. The\r\ncrisis of 1873 was far more severe than that of 1907, and recovery from\r\nit was very slow. The panic of 1884 extended far beyond Wall Street, but\r\nwas most severely felt there.\r\n\r\nThere was a stock market panic in 1890, due to the failure of Baring\r\nBros. & Co., in London, and heavy gold exports from this side to allay\r\nthe panic there, but it did not spread much beyond Wall Street, and was\r\nsoon over. The panic of 1893 was, however, severe and extensive, and\r\n15,000 failures were attributed to it throughout the country. As usual,\r\nit resulted from undue speculation and expansion in trade, stocks, and\r\nnew enterprises. But it was more immediately caused by the agitation of\r\nthe 16-to-1 silver heresy, which led to a run on the gold in the United\r\nStates Treasury till the amount of free gold held by it, at all points,\r\nwas less than twenty millions, while the amount in the Sub-Treasury in\r\nNew York was reduced to only about $8,700,000. It was then, in February,\r\n1893, that President Cleveland made his famous gold purchase for United\r\nStates bonds from the Morgan-Belmont syndicate, namely 3,500,000 ounces\r\nof gold for $62,312,500 of four per cent bonds. This, aided by the\r\nsyndicate’s efforts, stopped gold exports and replenished the supply of\r\ngold in the Treasury, and so restored confidence. Therefore the run\r\nceased; and after that the largely increased customs duties gradually\r\nswelled the gold belonging to the Government to a far larger amount than\r\nit had ever held before.\r\n\r\nComing down to the panic of 1907, we are confronted by its causes. These\r\nwere cumulative, but, as in every preceding crisis, the main cause was\r\nfar too large a mass of credits—that is, of debts—for the amount of cash\r\nin which they were redeemable. Trade and speculation had been long so\r\nactive, and too often recklessly expanded, that this disproportion had\r\nbecome dangerous, and a menace to our safety, as I pointed out several\r\ntimes months before the crisis actually came. I said that a serious\r\nreaction, a serious revulsion, was inevitable unless we moderated our\r\npace and mended our ways in the matters that I have elsewhere referred\r\nto and criticised.\r\n\r\nFrom my knowledge of banking, and my personal experience of our previous\r\npanics, dating from that of 1857, I could foresee that this vast and\r\ngrowing disproportion between the volume of credits and cash would\r\nfinally lead to collapse. This disproportion is always large, and always\r\nbecomes larger in periods of activity in trade and speculation. But in\r\nthis country, and particularly among our speculative Wall Street\r\nmillionaires and promoters, it had become unwieldy, while, very largely,\r\nliquid capital had been converted into fixed forms that were unavailable\r\nin raising cash.\r\n\r\nYet the people generally did not see the danger and take alarm till, on\r\nOctober 21, the New York Clearing House was notified by the Bank of\r\nCommerce that it would not clear for the Knickerbocker Trust Company\r\nafter the following day; and simultaneously the Clearing House made an\r\nexamination of the Mercantile National Bank, and ordered all its\r\nofficers and directors to resign at once, preparatory to assisting it.\r\n\r\nThen the public suddenly took fright, and the run upon the deposits of\r\nthe Knickerbocker Trust Company caused it to close its doors about two\r\nhours after it had opened them the next day. This added fuel to the fire\r\nof distrust, and the run on the Trust Company of America and its\r\nColonial Branch, and also on the Lincoln Trust Company, began; and six\r\nbanks and a trust company suspended in Brooklyn, and the Hamilton Bank\r\nin Harlem, on the day following.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was a heavy withdrawal of deposits from all the\r\nbanks and trust companies, and the money thus withdrawn was not\r\ndeposited in other institutions, but hoarded. Hence the severe monetary\r\nstringency that ensued, which caused call loans on the Stock Exchange to\r\ncommand as much as forty to fifty per cent per annum at one time, and\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty-five till the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe New York Clearing House saw the urgent need of promptly fortifying\r\nthe banks in the Association against the drain on their deposits, and,\r\non October 26, resolved to issue Clearing House certificates against\r\nsuch satisfactory assets as they might deposit, these certificates to be\r\nused by them instead of cash, in paying their daily balances at the\r\nClearing House. This gave immediate relief to the banks, and was the\r\nsignal for every other bank clearing house in the large cities to do\r\nlikewise, besides which many of the country banks issued checks of their\r\nown, from one dollar up, in payment of checks against deposits.\r\n\r\nThe other principal features and details of the crisis I have given\r\nelsewhere. But it must not be overlooked that, severe as it was in its\r\nactual effects, it was very largely sentimental in the sense that it was\r\nprecipitated by fear—fear born of distrust. That is the immediate cause\r\nof all panics, but without the superinducing causes this fear would not\r\nexist. In our case it was the very seriously impaired credit situation,\r\narising from a multiplicity of contributory causes, which inspired the\r\nfear that caused the runs on the banks and trust companies, and the\r\nhoarding of the money withdrawn, as well as the withholding of other\r\nmoney which, in the absence of distrust, would have been deposited. To\r\nfill the vacuum caused by hoarding, we outdid all our previous efforts\r\nby importing about a hundred millions of gold.\r\n\r\nThis hoarding, and consequent stringency, apart from the issue, in all,\r\nof $81,000,000 of Clearing House loan certificates, was responsible for\r\nthe premium on currency, which at one time was quoted at four to five\r\nper cent, for it practically forced the banks to a partial suspension of\r\npayments involved in requiring checks to be made payable through the\r\nClearing House, except in cases where they were willing to accommodate\r\ndepositors with small amounts of currency. But fortunately the premium,\r\nwhich had dwindled to ¼ @ ⅜ on the 31st of December, disappeared at the\r\nbeginning of 1908. Meanwhile, all through the crisis, large employers of\r\nlabor had found great difficulty, and incurred much expense, in\r\nobtaining currency enough to pay wages; and in Pittsburg and other\r\nlabor-employing centers, wages were paid largely in scrip issued by the\r\nbanks or employing corporations. This scrip was so generally issued that\r\nin Pittsburg all the street car lines accepted it for fares.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that these conditions seriously checked buying of all kinds,\r\nand caused demoralization and semi-paralysis in industrial corporations,\r\nand that hundreds of thousands of operatives were thrown out of\r\nemployment by the stoppage or curtailment of work in mills and other\r\nmanufacturing establishments. But the storm being over, and the money\r\nmarket again easy, there is every prospect of gradual, if not rapid,\r\nrecovery to a normal standard of prosperity in our trade and\r\nmanufacturing industries. It was not till January 11, 1908, that the\r\nClearing House reported the deficit in the bank reserves wiped out, and\r\na surplus of $6,084,050 accumulated against a deficit of $11,509,550 on\r\nJanuary 3d, and at one time of $81,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt should not be thought, because we imported a hundred millions of gold\r\nfrom Europe to relieve the monetary stress produced by the crisis, that\r\nwe thereby placed this country under obligations to any other country.\r\nThe gold we imported we bought and paid for from our own resources,\r\nequivalent to cash, in the shape of exports of cotton, grain, petroleum,\r\ncopper, and other American produce.\r\n\r\nThese commodities were even more necessary to Europe than the gold we\r\npurchased there was to us. So the transactions on both sides were mere\r\nmatters of bargain and sale, no favor being shown on either side.\r\nIndeed, both England and France did all they could to restrict our\r\nimportations of gold. The extraordinary advance of the Bank of England\r\nrate to seven per cent, and its retention there till we discontinued our\r\npurchases of gold, furnished practical proof of this. This was\r\njustifiable, of course, as a defensive and protective measure for the\r\nbank, but none the less it was an obstacle placed in our path.\r\n\r\nIts proclaimed purpose was to prevent our taking gold from Europe as\r\nmuch as possible, yet in the face of this heavy handicap we bought and\r\npaid for and imported all the gold we wanted, and it was not till after\r\nwe had stopped buying that the Bank of England lowered its rate to six\r\nper cent. This showed that we controlled the Bank of England more than\r\nthe Bank of England controlled us. We were not assisted; we assisted\r\nourselves, and neither asked nor received favors.\r\n\r\nThis important fact testified to the strength and wide sweep of our\r\nresources, both financial and commercial, and also to the solidity and\r\nsoundness of our business position, and the foundation on which it\r\nrested. The firmness, too, with which we bore the enormous strain of the\r\ncrisis, and the good order and condition in which we emerged from it,\r\nwere equally eloquent in testifying to the same effect, and showing that\r\nours is indeed a great country—the greatest of all nations in its\r\nmaterial resources and acquired wealth.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this is largely shared by us with the rest of the\r\nworld, both in our enormous foreign trade and the vast amount of money\r\nspent every year by American tourists in Europe. If the hundred and\r\nfifty millions of dollars spent by them there in 1907 had been kept at\r\nhome, it might have obviated the necessity of our importing gold to\r\nrelieve the crisis. Europe has good reason to return thanks for all it\r\ngets from us; and what would the trade and commerce of Europe be, in\r\nthis progressive age, without the United States of America?\r\n\r\nThe strength, the resolution, and the courage with which the country, as\r\na whole, bore the brunt of the crisis of 1907 augurs well for a rapid\r\nrecovery from its effects, and paves the way to renewed prosperity and\r\nprogress; and there is every probability that it will recuperate more\r\nswiftly from the great and trying ordeal than it did from the memorable\r\npanics of 1812, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1884, and 1893, for its wealth,\r\npopulation, and general resources are now so vastly greater than they\r\nwere at any of those periods that comparisons are out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe growth of our banking system alone since 1873 is indicated by the\r\nfact that in the very severe panic of that year the New York Clearing\r\nHouse issued only $16,000,000 of Clearing House certificates to the\r\nbanks belonging to it, whereas in the panic of 1884 it issued\r\n$21,000,000, in the panic of 1893 $41,000,000, and in this last panic of\r\n1907 no less than $81,000,000. The crisis was severe but it was\r\npurifying, and eliminated a vast amount of unwholesome and dangerous, if\r\nnot dishonest, speculative elements from the management of many of our\r\nbanks and large railway and industrial corporations, and left in its\r\nplace the legacy of a higher standard of business morality than we had\r\nbefore. Hence, perhaps we may say, with Shakespeare, all’s well that\r\nends well, and, with the Bible, out of evil cometh good. At least we\r\nhave plucked the flower Safety from the nettle Danger.\r\n\r\nThis view of our country, and the situation, is shared by the banking\r\ncommunity of the Old World, who also absolve President Roosevelt from\r\nblame or responsibility for the crisis. In this connection a leading\r\nLondon banker, Mr. H. H. Raphael, a member of Parliament and one of the\r\nmost influential and popular financial men in Great Britain, said, in\r\nDecember:\r\n\r\n“We regard President Roosevelt as not only one of the most courageous,\r\nbut one of the ablest of all your long line of distinguished Presidents.\r\nWe admire him for his courage and independence. No wonder the heart of\r\nthe American people is with him; he is giving you a good housecleaning,\r\nand you well need it; and although you are passing through financial\r\nstorm and stress now, we know something of the wonderful recuperative\r\npower of the United States, and it will not be long before America will\r\nbe forging ahead on the highway of economical progress, cleaner and\r\nstronger than ever.”\r\n\r\nThis opinion is well worth quoting because of its evident sincerity.\r\nThere is no suspicion of politics or office-seeking about the allusion\r\nto President Roosevelt, and if one man more than any other in this great\r\ncountry of ours deserves the resounding applause of a national “Hip!\r\nHip! Hurrah!” for his public services, it is President Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n              WALL STREET AS IT REALLY IS. A VINDICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people, and some newspapers, have a false impression that Wall\r\nStreet is a gambling arena that does a great deal of harm and no good,\r\nand that it ought to be, as far as possible, abolished, while Wall\r\nStreet speculators have been recklessly and unjustly denounced as\r\ngamblers.\r\n\r\nBut those who know Wall Street well have no such impressions of it, or\r\nits speculators, or of the Wall Street community of bankers and brokers.\r\nThey can, on the contrary, testify that there is no more honorable and\r\nresponsible body of men in the world than its bankers and the members of\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange, and that nowhere is honesty, integrity, and\r\ngood faith more resolutely exacted than on that Exchange, as its\r\nconstitution, by-laws, and rules clearly show; and nowhere is a black\r\nsheep, when discovered, more quickly and severely punished than there.\r\nThe penalties involve expulsion from membership, or suspension for any\r\nlength of time the Governors may think proper for violations of its\r\nrules, and they are rigorously enforced in all cases. The same remarks,\r\nI am glad to say, apply substantially to the stock exchanges in Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and other cities.\r\n\r\nDuring the crisis of 1907, and the exposures of corporate irregularities\r\nthat preceded it, no members of the Stock Exchange were implicated in\r\nthe wrongdoing that surprised and shocked the public. The men in control\r\nof the life insurance companies that were examined and held up to scorn,\r\nfor their misuse and misappropriation of other people’s money, were not\r\nmembers of the Stock Exchange, nor were they Wall Street men.\r\n\r\nThe men who wrecked the Metropolitan Street Railway System were not\r\nmembers of the Stock Exchange, nor were those apostles of unsound\r\nbanking, the speculative bank promoters who gained control of the three\r\nchains of New York City banks to promote their own speculative purposes,\r\nand inadvertently paved the way to the panic; nor was a member of the\r\nStock Exchange responsible for the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust\r\nCompany, or at all involved in that leading event of the panic; nor was\r\na member of the Stock Exchange responsible for any bank, trust company,\r\nor corporation failure, or run that occurred anywhere during the crisis,\r\nor at any time in the panic year.\r\n\r\nOf course there may possibly be undiscovered black sheep in Wall Street\r\nas well as elsewhere, for we find them in church pews, and occasionally\r\neven in church pulpits; but we should not heap wholesale condemnation\r\nupon either Wall Street or the churches on that account.\r\n\r\nTo call the buying and selling of stocks or bonds, on the Stock\r\nExchange, gambling, is a misnomer, a misuse of the word, due either to\r\nignorance of the transactions there, or malice. It is so whether the\r\npurchases or sales are by investors or speculators, for speculation on\r\nthe Stock Exchange is not gambling. Whether stocks, or bonds, are\r\nbought, or sold, by investors or speculators is immaterial between the\r\ncontracting brokers on the floor of the Exchange. They know no\r\ndifference whatever. Delivery of the stocks or bonds is made by the one,\r\nand received by the other, in every case, and payments made accordingly,\r\nat the sale and purchase prices, investment and speculative transactions\r\nbeing treated exactly alike.\r\n\r\nA sale and purchase is the work of a moment in the Board Rooms, and no\r\nvoucher is exchanged to prove it till comparisons are made at the\r\nbrokers’ offices, usually after the Exchange closes. But no contract\r\nthus made in an instant of time is ever repudiated, no matter how heavy\r\na loss it may involve to buyer or seller, for the penalty of such a\r\nrepudiation would be immediate suspension from the Stock Exchange,\r\nfollowed by expulsion when proved.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Stock Exchange are not only men of assured solvency and\r\nrespectability but of good social position, and generally of large means\r\nand more than ordinary education and culture. Most of them, too, belong\r\nto our best clubs. Any conduct of theirs that was considered prejudicial\r\nto the interests of the Exchange would render them amenable to\r\ndiscipline, and be promptly investigated by the Governing Committee,\r\nwhose duty it is to inflict the prescribed penalties, in such cases,\r\nwithout fear or favor. The fact that a membership has a market value\r\nvarying from $50,000 to $90,000 is a certain guarantee of solvency and\r\nfair dealing under ordinary circumstances. A Stock Exchange membership\r\nthus carries with it a large property qualification, and its owner is a\r\nsubstantial citizen, who is, as we know, often one of “the Four\r\nHundred,” or to be seen in our best society, and whose wealth, in many\r\ninstances, amounts to millions. Preliminary to admission also he has to\r\nsubmit to a searching examination by the Committee on Admissions.\r\n\r\nRecent attacks upon the character of the New York Stock Exchange are\r\nentirely unjustified and have been prompted by either ignorance or\r\nprejudice. If the Stock Exchange were abolished great enterprises would\r\nsoon be paralyzed. Without its medium it would be impossible to raise\r\nthe capital for conducting our great railroad and industrial\r\ncorporations; investors would be deprived of the means of finding\r\nprofitable employment for their capital, and there would be no free\r\nmarket for the many millions of securities there dealt in. Abolish the\r\nStock Exchange and the free play of market forces which best develop\r\nreal values; then investors would be kept in the dark and their\r\nproperties would be exposed to grosser manipulations than ever thought\r\nof by stock market operators. The New York Stock Exchange, it should be\r\nremembered, is nothing more than a well-systematized market place for\r\nthe exchange of or trading in securities. From the very nature of its\r\npurpose and its organization it cannot exercise any direct control over\r\nthe management of the corporations whose securities are dealt in by its\r\nmembers. It may establish certain rules as to the conduct of business by\r\nits members, and may insist that only securities of certain standards\r\nshall be dealt in on its floor. Beyond that it cannot go; and buyers and\r\nsellers alike, as in all matters of business, are expected to exercise\r\ntheir own intelligence as to the merits of investments. One thing is\r\ncertain, that whatever its shortcomings there is no organized body of\r\nbusiness men where the standards of integrity are higher and more fixed\r\nthan on the New York Stock Exchange. Its transactions are carried on\r\nchiefly by word of mouth; the spoken word being as sacredly kept as\r\nsigned contracts. Further, there is a Board of Governors to whom any\r\ncomplaint can be carried, whose purpose is to prevent all abuses within\r\nits power and to maintain the highest possible standards of business.\r\nAll infractions of the rules are promptly punished. Certainly, whoever\r\nbegins throwing stones at the New York Stock Exchange should first look\r\nand see if his own window-panes are not in danger.\r\n\r\nA great deal of nonsense is also heard about speculation. Now,\r\nspeculation, like many other good things, may be carried to excess, and\r\nis then injurious and open to the severest criticism. But speculation\r\nwithin reasonable limits is most beneficial. It is one of the main\r\nincentives to enterprise. Crush this disposition to venture, or the\r\nwillingness to accept a risk, and enterprise would languish, trade and\r\nindustry would decline, and we should gradually settle down to certain\r\nindustrial and commercial decay. In the present highly developed state\r\nof modern civilization speculation is a motive power of the first\r\nimportance, and being a part of human nature itself cannot be\r\neradicated. In the course of ordinary business, speculation is the\r\nnatural balance wheel of trade, furnishing a class of operators who are\r\nwilling to buy or sell when others for various reasons are disinclined.\r\nMoreover, by keeping up the conflict between a large body of buyers and\r\nsellers the true value of securities or commodities is more safely\r\ndetermined than when speculation is entirely absent. The short seller is\r\nalways a buyer at a lower price, and therefore a supporter in case of\r\ndecline. Conversely, the long buyer restrains undue advances by selling\r\nto secure his profits. Again, the banker is better able to judge the\r\nvalue of collateral in a free and active market, a factor which is much\r\nto the advantage of both legitimate borrowers and lenders who may not\r\nhave the remotest interest in speculative movements. The giving of\r\ncredit and the making of loans is very largely dependent upon a thorough\r\ntest of values such as speculation only often determines. Of course\r\nspeculation is sometimes carried to excess, and much injury results in\r\nconsequence. Such excesses which are the consequence of defects in human\r\nnature must always be expected and are better corrected by experience\r\nand public opinion than by any artificial regulation. Who has not the\r\nright to profit from good business judgment, especially if that judgment\r\nincurs the risk of the future; and who should complain if his own\r\njudgment leads him into losing transactions? Concerning speculation\r\nthere is also another foolish misconception. Speculation is frequently\r\nconfounded with gambling, although the two are radically different.\r\nSpeculation is based upon knowledge and facts, whereas gambling deals\r\nsolely with chance. It is a fallacy to suppose that any but a small\r\npercentage of transactions on the New York Stock Exchange come under the\r\nhead of gambling. What difference is there between buying stocks and\r\nbonds on part payment, or margin as it is often called, and buying land\r\nor houses or other property with only one-fifth in cash and carrying the\r\nbalance on mortgage? Such transactions are speculative, are strictly\r\nmoral, and entirely a matter of business judgment. All operations\r\nentering into the future are necessarily speculative. So far as the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange is concerned its rules are drawn for the strict\r\npurpose of protecting legitimate trading, and an actual transfer of\r\nproperty is required for every transaction. Of course, abuses exist in\r\nall trades and will continue to exist, rendering it the more necessary\r\nto use a little intelligent discrimination before condescending to loose\r\ndenunciation, which may easily do much harm and no good.\r\n\r\nThe President’s attack on options in his recent message to Congress\r\ncertainly cannot apply to any business transacted on the New York Stock\r\nExchange, as options are not dealt in there. Options of from three to\r\nsixty days were dealt in a great many years ago, but were abandoned long\r\nsince. Every purchase and sale now made on the floor of the New York\r\nStock Exchange provides for a delivery on the day of purchase, or the\r\nfollowing day, and payment made therefor upon delivery of the security,\r\nand no law can possibly be passed by Congress, or the State Legislature,\r\nto prevent a broker thus buying securities for a customer on part\r\npayment on terms satisfactory to himself, any more than a law could be\r\nenacted to prevent a dry goods, hardware, grocer, or merchant in any\r\nother line from extending credit to his customers. Nearly all the\r\nbusiness of the world is thus transacted, and could not be done on a\r\nlarge scale otherwise. In London, however, most of the business is\r\nvirtually on an option basis, as it provides for fortnightly\r\nsettlements, there being two settlement periods each month, which can be\r\nextended from time to time indefinitely at the option of the parties\r\nconnected therewith.\r\n\r\nThe method of doing business in “futures” prevails on the Cotton and\r\nProduce Exchanges, and could not well be transacted, to the extent of\r\nmaking an active market for the benefit of the producers, on any other\r\nbasis, in my opinion. To do away with dealings in futures would simply\r\ndo away with the exchanges, which would be to the disadvantage of the\r\nfarmers. A farmer, as soon as he ascertains that his crop is secure,\r\nmakes a calculation of how long it will take to put it in his barn,\r\nthrash it out, and transmit it to Chicago, and he sells it to deliver\r\nduring that month or a later one, thus ridding himself of any further\r\nrisk of fluctuation in the price, and is made happy thereby. If he is\r\ndeprived of such a market, it puts him back to the old way of doing\r\nbusiness, when the large dealers from Liverpool, Chicago, and other\r\nquarters sent their agents direct to the farmers at harvest time, and by\r\nbringing all kinds of discouraging influences to bear upon them made\r\nthem sell at a fraction above the cost of production; as against this\r\nthey are at present able to hold their crop back and get the highest\r\nprice. In having the ready market which now exists the farmers have all\r\nbecome rich. Why, therefore, change the present plan, which has given so\r\nmuch prosperity to the producers of cotton and other products, to what\r\nmight be likely to reverse their present satisfactory condition?\r\n\r\nMembers of the New York Stock Exchange, in cases of insolvency, are\r\nrequired, by the rules, to immediately notify the Stock Exchange of\r\ntheir inability to meet their contracts, and the selling or buying in\r\n“under the rule,” to close defaulted contracts, if there are any,\r\nusually follows the announcement of a failure and failure carries with\r\nit suspension. But failures in the Stock Exchange are very few and far\r\nbetween, considering that there are eleven hundred members. They are\r\nindeed far below the average of failures in mercantile business, and\r\nthey are generally followed by satisfactory settlements and readmission\r\nto membership, and a resumption of business.\r\n\r\nThis speaks well for both the integrity and the conservatism of Stock\r\nExchange houses. It is very seldom that what would be called a bad\r\nfailure occurs among them. There are, in fact, no abuses on the Stock\r\nExchange, for trickery and unfair dealing is impossible, owing to the\r\nstrictness of the surveillance and discipline constantly maintained over\r\nthe members, who are also themselves punctilious in keeping their\r\ncontracts and observing the rules, and doing only what is fair and\r\nsquare in business. This is essential to their own interests and\r\nsuccess, as bankers and brokers, without regard to the penalty of\r\nsuspension, or expulsion, for any irregularity. That penalty they\r\napprove of, for it is a protection for all of them, except an occasional\r\nblack sheep that they are glad to see weeded out of the Exchange.\r\n\r\nHow necessary the Stock Exchange is to the banks was shown during the\r\nrecent crisis, as in preceding panics, when to protect themselves they\r\nwere forced to call in their loans by wholesale, and where necessary to\r\nat once liquidate the collaterals. It was the Stock Exchange that made\r\nthis liquidation possible, and saved many of the banks and trust\r\ncompanies from suspension, as well as many bankers and brokers, who were\r\nenabled by it to pass through the trying ordeal, instead of going to the\r\nwall in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThe Stock Exchange therefore obviously performs a great and very useful\r\nand important function in monetary affairs, besides being the barometer\r\nof values for stocks and bonds, as measured by prices, while the cotton\r\nand the grain exchanges perform a similar service with regard to those\r\nspeculative commodities.\r\n\r\nYet one effect of the crisis of 1907 has been to give a new impulse to\r\nWall Street detraction, and sharpen the teeth and claws of the\r\ndetractors. While many are mistaken enough to hold Wall Street\r\nresponsible for the past year’s financial disaster, many more are\r\nequally mistaken in declaring that President Roosevelt caused them by\r\nhis speeches and the Government prosecutions of law-breaking railway and\r\nIndustrial Corporations. Both charges are unreasonable and false, but\r\nthis consideration is a small matter to those who have no hesitation in\r\nmaking reckless assertions which they are unable to prove, and who are\r\nas ready to vent their spite as they are their prejudices.\r\n\r\nMany indeed without knowing anything about Wall Street speculation, and\r\nwho have never speculated anywhere, blame speculation for a host of\r\nevils that are in no way due to it. Some of them would even close the\r\nStock Exchange to stop speculation there, forgetting apparently that\r\nthis would deprive investors and banking institutions as well as\r\nspeculators of a market for securities, and make all the stocks and\r\nbonds now listed and dealt in there practically unmarketable. In such an\r\nevent there would most certainly be a fall in their prices greater than\r\nany we witnessed in 1907.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the manipulation of stocks matched orders may have\r\nbeen occasionally resorted to, despite the rule against it on the Stock\r\nExchange, but it is only because of the difficulty, or impossibility, of\r\ndiscovering or proving it, for there is no body of men subject to\r\nstricter discipline, or more amenable to it, than the members of the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange, nor any more patriotic, as their generous acts\r\nduring the Civil War, and at other times, have abundantly shown.\r\n\r\nNeither should it be forgotten that they pay the State of New York a tax\r\nof two dollars on every hundred shares of stock they sell, which is an\r\nimportant source of revenue to the commonwealth. That the Stock\r\nExchange, as a free market for securities, is indispensable to the\r\ncountry is beyond question. It is necessary to our national needs, and I\r\nam proud of being one of the oldest of its members, my membership dating\r\nfrom 1864; and I am able from long personal experience and observation\r\nto testify to the integrity, soundness, and general good character of my\r\nfellow members and the banking community of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nTherefore take my word for it that Wall Street is not as black as it is\r\npainted, and that anyone’s money is as safe there as anywhere in\r\nbusiness, if properly placed, and handled with good judgment. If any of\r\nit is lost it is by its owner, and he has only himself to blame for his\r\nill luck. But it is always to the interest of his banker and broker to\r\nhave him make money, for when a customer loses his money his broker in\r\nsome degree shares the loss by losing him as a customer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I hope that if any of you ever take a flyer in Wall\r\nStreet, you will come out of it, with flying colors, on the winning\r\nside, and with a good opinion of the Street proportioned to the\r\nmagnificence of your success!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n       THE FINANCIAL AND TRADE SITUATION, PAST,\r\n                             PRESENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAND FUTURE, REVIEWING THE CRISIS OF 1907, WITH CAUSES AND REMEDIES.[10]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  An address delivered by Henry Clews at the annual meeting of the\r\n  Pittsburg Chapter, American Institute of Banking, at Pittsburg, Pa.,\r\n  on Tuesday evening, February 25, 1908.\r\n\r\nIt gives me no ordinary pleasure to address an audience of Pittsburg\r\nbankers, for Pittsburg is the hub of our iron and steel industry, and as\r\nit has no rival in the manufacture of iron and steel, it may well feel\r\nproud of its supremacy. It is no exaggeration to say that the rise and\r\nprogress of that industry in Pittsburg is one of the marvels of the age.\r\nA few years ago Pittsburg was known in New York as the Smoky City. A\r\nlittle later she became known as the City of Steel and Coal. Now,\r\nthrough the alchemy of the brains of your wise men, she is known as the\r\nplace where smoke and coal and steel are in some mysterious way mixed up\r\nin such a form that they fill your pockets with pure gold. To the\r\nmillionaire of to-day we bow in deference to his wealth. But to the\r\ngrimy sons of toil, who planted the seed and bore the burdens of the\r\nearlier days, we take off our hats with reverence. The founders of your\r\ncity chose wisely in selecting this spot for settlement, at the river’s\r\njunction, in the midst of rich deposits of coal and iron. It seems\r\nrather odd that your two greatest products should be glass, which is\r\nbrittle, and steel, which is tough. You also excel in producing cork,\r\nwhich is light, and iron, which is heavy. Surely extremes meet in your\r\ncity as well as rivers. Down our way we wonder what you do not produce\r\nwhen we learn of the diversity of your wares. It certainly seems to me\r\nthat a man could learn a whole lot if allowed to visit all your various\r\nfoundries, factories and mills, but it would take him nearly as long as\r\nto go through college, as their name is legion. The welcome which you\r\nhave given me touches me deeply, and I assure you that in future I shall\r\npreach the doctrine that there are others in Pittsburg whose mission it\r\nis to dispense happiness besides Mr. Carnegie.\r\n\r\nIf we glance at the history of steel manufacturing in the United States,\r\nwe find it centered in and very largely confined to Pittsburg, and if we\r\nrecall the enormous fortunes made in that industry by Mr. Carnegie and\r\nmany others, under the protection of high tariff, we see one of the\r\ngreatest wonders of trade development and modern enterprise.\r\n\r\nYet it was not until after the beginning of the war between the North\r\nand the South—the great conflict waged from 1861 to 1865—that any large\r\nor even considerable amount of steel was manufactured in the United\r\nStates. But now we lead the world in making it, and Pittsburg is our\r\ngreat source of supply. At the same time, we can justly say that the\r\nmarch of invention and modern improvement in other directions has kept\r\npace with the growth of Pittsburg and our marvelous progress in iron and\r\nsteel-making.\r\n\r\nThis reflection is particularly gratifying in view of our recent\r\nfinancial crisis, in which New York was the storm-center, and Pittsburg\r\nalmost as stormy for a time. But both cities, like the country at large,\r\nstood up bravely and made the best of the situation by all the means at\r\ntheir command. Both fortified themselves by a good emergency measure and\r\nissued Clearing House Certificates, according to their needs. Pittsburg,\r\nhowever, went one or two better than New York, and, like many other\r\ncities, issued scrip; and better still no one in Pittsburg refused it,\r\nnot even a car conductor for fares. Here was public spirit rising almost\r\nto the height of patriotism.\r\n\r\nNow, Pittsburg in common with the rest of the country is again about on\r\nan even keel financially, with its banks on a cash basis, its cashiers’\r\ncertificates and scrip redeemed, and its Stock Exchange reopened. But\r\nunfortunately the crisis gave industry a blow from which it has not yet\r\nrecovered, although conditions are steadily improving all over the\r\nUnited States. The iron and steel industry received the hardest blow of\r\nall, and from a feast you quickly passed to a famine, which is a way the\r\niron trade always had. It is proverbially, however, as quick to recover\r\nas to collapse; so all we have to do is to keep up our courage and wait,\r\nand we may feel assured there is a good time coming. But whether it will\r\ncome soon, or later, is a question about which iron-masters, financiers,\r\nand trade doctors generally are much divided in opinion at present. It\r\nis a good sign, however, that work has been resumed in fully\r\nthree-fourths of the entire Duquesne works of the United States Steel\r\nCorporation in Pittsburg, although it is admitted that only 46 per cent\r\nof all the Corporation’s works are running.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1906, when stock and bond prices were manipulated\r\nabnormally to a 3½ per cent basis, while six months’ money was loaning\r\nat 6 per cent, it was evident that one or the other was too high; and\r\nconsidering the growing demand for the use of money it became quite\r\napparent it was not money that was too dear, but securities. At that\r\ntime I persistently advised every one to get out of stocks and out of\r\ndebt, and keep out for a prolonged period.\r\n\r\nSince then security values went down prodigiously—$3,500,000,000 would\r\nscarcely cover the depreciation at its lowest point of those dealt in on\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange alone. Our financial situation is vastly\r\ndifferent, however, from what it was in any of our previous great\r\npanics, of which there have been a number, since that of 1857, which\r\nbegan with the failure of the Ohio Life & Trust Co. at the time of my\r\nadvent in Wall Street. I have been in all the subsequent panics, and the\r\npresent conditions differ from those of all the other great financial\r\nstorms because the wealth of the nation has become so vast as to make it\r\nthe richest in actual wealth and productiveness of all nations. As a\r\nmatter of fact, our wealth-making developments have been so extensive\r\nand excessive as to have forged ahead of our banking facilities. This\r\nhas had much to do with our recent setback. Wise and sagacious\r\ncapitalists saw the handwriting on the wall in Wall Street and\r\nelsewhere, and those who did unloaded their securities in 1906, dumping\r\ntheir stocks at top-notch prices, amounting to at least $1,000,000,000,\r\nupon weaker-backed people.\r\n\r\nThis unloading, together with the San Francisco earthquake disaster,\r\nwhich wiped out $350,000,000 of property, struck the staggering blows\r\nwhich did more than anything else to pave the way to the recent panic\r\nconditions. The selling out by big holders was followed by all the large\r\nrailroad systems in the country selling huge amounts of bonds, stocks\r\nand short-term notes. These being offered to stockholders of record at\r\napparently tempting prices, were floated. But this great mass of new\r\nsecurities coming on the market was an indigestible one, and absorbed\r\nthe capital of a very large number of the rich men of the country and\r\nput it in fixed form; and most of these heretofore very rich men have\r\never since been in the position of a man who, having had a “Sherry\r\ndinner,” is urged to accept another dinner at Delmonico’s immediately\r\nafterwards—his wish strong but his capacity lacking.\r\n\r\nWhat produced the panic was a number of adverse factors happening one\r\nafter another in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nI summarize, briefly, the causes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe Boer war which left England in almost as bad a financial strait as\r\nwe were in through the culmination of a similar period of overdoing in\r\ntrade and speculation in new industrial ventures, together with an\r\nexcess of new issues of British Consols during the war period resulting\r\nin a recent decline in the price of these prime securities to 81—about\r\nthe lowest price on record.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SECOND.\r\n\r\nGermany was in fully as bad a condition owing to extravagant industrial\r\nenterprises, rivalling our own, and which required the most careful\r\nnursing to avoid a collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 THIRD.\r\n\r\nFrance acted alone in financing Russian loans, and in the crisis of the\r\nJapanese-Russian war was compelled unwillingly to supply new funds in\r\norder to protect the French loans already outstanding. Hence France had\r\nlittle or no money to lend except to the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOURTH.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese-Russian war brought both of these countries forward for the\r\nfirst time as prominent and important factors in the world’s money\r\nmarket, and both are still, like Oliver Twist, crying for “more.” This\r\nconflict and the Boer war combined wasted over $2,000,000,000 of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FIFTH.\r\n\r\nFunds were almost unobtainable except at prohibitive rates at the time\r\nof our recent crop-moving period, and for causes already mentioned we\r\ncould not look to Europe for help. Usually Europe discounts New York\r\nsecurities bills for about $300,000,000 at this period, but last year\r\nEurope said: “No; we have troubles of our own.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SIXTH.\r\n\r\nThe California earthquake with losses of $350,000,000, and the Chili and\r\nother earthquakes of less importance and severity in various parts of\r\nthe world were heavy blows at prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nThe compulsory unloading of very many millions of dollars of stocks and\r\nbonds by large capitalists and operators, together with immense sales of\r\nnew securities by corporations and railroads, and the manipulation of\r\nprices and stocks up to a 3½ per cent interest basis while time money\r\nwas loaning at 6 per cent, and above, on the best of collateral. Besides\r\nwhich heavy, excessive and reckless operations in real estate and mining\r\nenterprises having been made all over the nation, caused large amounts\r\nof capital to lose its liquid quality and become fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the great life insurance companies and the\r\nMetropolitan railroad, and the sad disclosures, followed by the absurd\r\nfine of $29,400,000 by Judge Landis against a corporation with a capital\r\nof only $1,000,000, had a demoralizing effect upon the public mind. This\r\npreposterous fine savored of confiscation and alarmed investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NINTH.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission’s examination of the Chicago & Alton\r\ndeal and the consequent developments further undermined the confidence\r\nof investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TENTH.\r\n\r\nThe making of injudicious loans by the Knickerbocker Trust Co. and the\r\nchains of banks, both in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which caused the\r\nsuspension of the institutions and arrest of officials on criminal\r\ncharges intensified public distrust, while the collapse of the Copper\r\nmarket unsettled the metal markets all over the world and resulted in a\r\nreduction of dividends on copper shares, and a serious break in the\r\nprice of all that class of securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LASTLY.\r\n\r\nA gross abuse of our credit system and the consequent inflation of all\r\nvalues, stimulated by loose banking and promoting methods, proved the\r\nclimax in a series of events which culminated in the sharpest though not\r\nthe severest panic the present generation has experienced. The main\r\ncause of the panic was that of general overdoing. Credit was\r\nover-extended; speculation was reckless and ill-advised; expansion of\r\nevery sort was being carried to excess by over-confidence, until finally\r\nthe country’s floating capital was practically exhausted through being\r\nturned too rapidly from liquid to fixed forms. We have only to glance at\r\nthe demands upon new capital during the last year or two to realize this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the congested state of the stock market may be obtained\r\nfrom the fact that during the last five years the total amount of new\r\nsecurities authorized was $6,800,000,000; the eleven months of 1907\r\nalone accounting for $2,000,000,000 of this total.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter period our railroads authorized $1,400,000,000\r\nsecurities, of which they were able to issue only one-half, owing to\r\nmoney market conditions. Of industrial securities less than $500,000,000\r\nwere authorized, but nearly $400,000,000 of these appear to have been\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nThese figures take no account of the issues of municipal securities, and\r\nthose of many other business concerns of a minor character, but they are\r\nquite sufficient to indicate the extraordinary demands upon the money\r\nmarket during the last two years, demands which in connection with huge\r\nspeculative borrowings imposed an unbearable strain upon the banks and\r\nprecipitated the March, August and October collapses in the stock\r\nmarket. Other influences have undoubtedly been at work to cause the\r\nbreakdown, but no single factor compares in importance with that of the\r\nexcessive issues of new securities and obligations during the past two\r\nyears which the country was utterly unable to assimilate.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the cause of the recent panicky contraction and\r\ndisturbance in the business and financial world, nothing, however, could\r\nbe further from the truth than to charge it all to the great corporation\r\nexposures and prosecutions.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, there were many other things that contributed to bring\r\nabout last year’s depression and disturbance, and to cast over the\r\nbright sky of business prosperity the heavy clouds of distrust, reaction\r\nand panic.\r\n\r\nThe recent clouds in the financial sky can remotely be attributed in a\r\nlarge measure to the effect of the tremendous railroad, industrial and\r\ncommercial development of the last ten years, which brought about\r\ncapital requirements in excess of the ability of the country to supply\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNaturally and necessarily, this resulted in precautionary steps being\r\ntaken by bankers and others to limit demands that capital could not\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThis conservatism and consequent contraction of the overwhelming volume\r\nof business will, it is believed, prove the strongest force in averting\r\nfurther trouble and disaster.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to meet the demands of the enormous business offered them,\r\nthe great railway and industrial corporations sought to enlarge their\r\nequipment at vast expense. In this they acted unwisely. They overtraded.\r\nIt was perhaps excusable not very long ago, when confidence was in its\r\nzenith and credit superabundant, to attempt the financing of mammoth\r\nundertakings. But unexpectedly and like a bolt out of a clear sky, came\r\nthe startling insurance and other exposures, and gradually timidity took\r\nthe place of confidence.\r\n\r\nThen capital, which is always more timid than usual at such times, began\r\nto contract, and many railroad and industrial corporations found\r\nthemselves unable to borrow the large sums needed to meet their\r\nextraordinary expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe banks, in many instances, having already over-extended credits, were\r\nunable to provide the necessary funds, and new securities, owing to\r\nexcessive supplies and other causes, ceased to find the ready market\r\nthat they had enjoyed for so long a period. Investors took wing.\r\nCurtailment, therefore, in every direction became a necessity; President\r\nRoosevelt can no more be blamed for the recent depression and panicky\r\ndisturbance than he can be credited with all the great prosperity that\r\npreceded the crisis.\r\n\r\nThat this reaction, culminating in a panic so severe, came just at the\r\ntime it did, is largely if not wholly coincidental. It cannot be denied,\r\nhowever, that the startling disclosures of wrongdoing on the part of\r\nmany of the great railroad and industrial corporations disturbed the\r\nconfidence of the public to the core, and paved the way to it.\r\n\r\nBeing now myself optimistic, I look on the sunny side and hope for the\r\nbest. It is, however, a time for conservatism, and while trusting in\r\nProvidence, it is well to keep our powder dry. It is a good time to\r\ncultivate the virtue of patience, and make haste slowly until all the\r\naftermath of the panic, in the way of liquidation and the elimination of\r\nunsound timber from business structures, is completed.\r\n\r\nThis will leave everything in the financial and industrial world\r\nstronger than before. It will also leave us with a higher standard of\r\nbusiness morality resulting from the exposure of looting and other\r\nillegal practices and abuses of power in the management of large\r\ncorporations. The stoppage of the evil of rebating by the railroads is\r\nof itself a great gain in this respect, and for this we have to thank\r\nPresident Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAs to the future, Pittsburg and the iron and steel trade should be the\r\nfirst to feel improvement in the general business of the country, for\r\niron is still the best barometer of the times, as it leads all other\r\nindustries in both depression and recovery, and what an eventful history\r\nPittsburg can point to, the world knows.\r\n\r\nIt was at Pittsburg that the Bessemer process was first applied to steel\r\nmaking in America, and the giant strides in the industry that followed\r\nits supersedure of the open-hearth process not only astonished ourselves\r\nbut all Europe. It was a new departure on a grand scale, this\r\napplication of science to mechanical methods, a revelation that was\r\nmarvellous in the trade expansion and wealth it produced.\r\n\r\nYet it is not improbable that before long, if not immediately, the\r\nBessemer process by which this immense development was achieved will be\r\nvery generally superseded by the open-hearth process of steel making,\r\nwhich originated and had its early development in this country. Thus in\r\nthe whirligig of time it will displace the Bessemer process, by which it\r\nwas itself displaced. This, as you are of course aware, is owing to\r\nimprovements, chiefly by Talbott, an American engineer, in the\r\nopen-hearth process, which for a long time has been considered almost\r\nout of the race in competition with the Bessemer process. This reminds\r\nus that history repeats itself.\r\n\r\nThe open-hearth process has now been brought to such perfection that its\r\nsuperiority over the Bessemer process is declared by many in the trade\r\nto be established. Thus practice makes perfect, and time works wonders.\r\nIts superiority over the Bessemer process is said to have been\r\nparticularly demonstrated in dealing with ores of any but a very low\r\nphosphorus grade. This American improvement in the open-hearth process\r\nhas been already widely recognized and adopted in England, and we are in\r\nthis way repaying the debt we owed to that country for the Bessemer\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe steel manufactured in the United States last year aggregated\r\n23,246,000 tons, of which 12,275,000 tons were by the Bessemer process\r\nand 10,971,000 tons by the open-hearth process. There were also some\r\nother varieties of production, copied from processes in use on the\r\nEuropean Continent, but the general drift, I am informed, is now towards\r\nthe open-hearth process.\r\n\r\nOut of Pittsburg, of course, I should not talk so much about steel, but\r\niron and steel are Pittsburg’s bread and butter. This reminds me that\r\napart from agriculture the principal sources of our national wealth are\r\nminerals and manufacturing. Mining and manufacturing are primary and\r\nfundamental industries. Our agricultural income last year, according to\r\nthe United States census estimates, was about seven thousand millions of\r\ndollars, while the metals mined were valued at about two thousand\r\nmillions, against $1,902,517,565 in 1906.\r\n\r\nThis metallic product for the year, it is estimated, was turned by\r\nmanufacturing it into materials having a market value of fifteen\r\nthousand millions of dollars. If we add that of agriculture, the\r\nmetallic products, and manufacturing, together, we have a total\r\nvaluation for the year of twenty-four thousand millions of dollars. The\r\nfertility of our natural resources is here shown by their rapid rate of\r\ndevelopment. But this, while contributing so largely to our present\r\nnational wealth, is not an unmixed good. We should always bear in mind\r\nthat the more we take out of the earth, and the more we strip our\r\nforests of timber, the less we have remaining. In forestry, however, we\r\nare now preparing for the future by replanting, but we cannot replant\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe mineral products of this country have more than trebled since 1890;\r\nmore than doubled since 1899; and are more than five fold what they were\r\nin 1880. From 1900 to 1906 our mineral product increased at a rate\r\nrepresenting a hundred and ninety millions a year.\r\n\r\nI am quoting these statistics as a reminder of the vastness of our\r\nnatural resources, and the recuperative power of the nation, which is\r\none of the most encouraging features of the national situation. These\r\nresources are the backbone of the country’s greatness; and those who can\r\nsee nothing cheerful in the outlook and to whom everything at times\r\nlooks as blue as indigo, will do well to think of them, for they are\r\nNature’s national banks, that can never fail, and unfailing sources of\r\nour national prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt was these resources, in the form of exports to foreign countries,\r\nthat enabled us to purchase and pay for—without borrowing or asking\r\nfavors—the one hundred millions of gold that we imported to relieve the\r\ncrisis. Here was indisputable evidence of the large international trade\r\nbalance in our favor, and of our monetary and commercial independence of\r\nthe rest of the world; and this gold we still hold, although in the\r\nordinary course of commerce we may reasonably export some of it before\r\nlong, for we have plenty to spare and money is superabundant at two per\r\ncent on call in Wall Street. Meanwhile our exports of produce and other\r\nmerchandise continue extremely heavy, and they were never heavier than\r\nduring the crisis, that is, in the last three months of 1907, while in\r\nJanuary, 1908, they rose to a total value of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight millions, or $17,742,352 more than in January, 1907. This\r\nis all the more favorable because our imports since the crisis have very\r\nlargely decreased. In our January exports, cotton alone represented\r\n$76,687,508 of the total, and breadstuffs $24,463,503.\r\n\r\nAs to our national finances and the defects of our currency system,\r\nthere is much that calls for reform, but there seems to be little or no\r\nprospect at this session of Congress of the passage of a comprehensive\r\nfinancial measure, although it is a remedy we need. We shall therefore\r\nhave to rest content for the time being with the much amended emergency\r\ncurrency measure, familiar to us as the Aldrich Bill. This provides only\r\nfor the issue of a maximum of five hundred millions of currency by the\r\nGovernment to the national banks, to ward off a panic or mitigate its\r\neffects, the banks to pay six per cent interest per annum for whatever\r\nthey take of this emergency currency, and give security in acceptable\r\nrailway, municipal and other bonds for it to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. I am, therefore, strongly in favor of the Aldrich\r\nmeasure as a panic remedy, naturally so as I originated the fundamental\r\npart of it. It will do much to prevent panics, and will effectually stop\r\nthe hoarding of currency that accompanies them, for what inducement\r\nwould there be to hoard it when a supply of five hundred millions of new\r\ncurrency would be open to the banks? There could be no extreme scarcity\r\nof money then; nothing in any way approaching the stringency that not\r\nonly New York but the whole United States suffered under in the last\r\nthree months of 1907.\r\n\r\nYet the great remedy, the comprehensive financial reform measure we need\r\nwill be ultimately passed by Congress, and its provisions will include\r\nthe modification of the Sub-Treasury system, which has always been a\r\nsource of much mischief through locking up Government money received for\r\nCustoms duties and internal revenue taxes, that ought to be kept in\r\ncirculation. The proposition, however, to establish a central national\r\nbank in New York, or anywhere else, as a substitute for it, is to be\r\nstrongly deprecated. It would be a rich plum for those who controlled\r\nit, but would excite the jealousy and hostility of all the other banks.\r\nMoreover, such a bank would in effect be a revival of the old United\r\nStates Bank, against which, and the scandals and corruption connected\r\nwith it, President Jackson made war so vigorously as to force it into\r\nliquidation. The second experiment of a United States bank was no less\r\ninvolved in scandal and no less a failure than the first, and in each\r\ncase there was the same inglorious end, compulsory liquidation. Both,\r\ntoo, were used as political machines, and guilty of favoritism and many\r\nabuses of power, and a new central bank would give us another big\r\npolitical and speculative machine, liable to the same evils and\r\nobjections. Therefore all bankers should resolutely oppose a central\r\nbank. It would not be a remedy for any of the evils complained of, but,\r\ninstead, furnish us with a new complication.\r\n\r\nWhile we can hardly expect any fundamental changes in our currency\r\nsystem at present, one improvement might easily be made in it by\r\nCongress at once, and that is by the removal of restrictions on the\r\namount of national bank notes taken out or canceled per month, as well\r\nas by establishing a bank-note redemption bureau at every United States\r\nSub-Treasury, so as to save the delay and expense of sending to and from\r\nthe Redemption Bureau at Washington, that all the national banks are now\r\nsubjected to. As a minor remedy this should be urged upon Congress.\r\n\r\nTurning to the United States bonds pledged with the Treasury to secure\r\nthe national bank notes, we all know that they are as good as gold, if\r\nnot better, but still they are evidences of debt, and it is a false\r\neconomic principle to issue currency on such a basis. Moreover, it is\r\ncostly for the Government, for it practically and permanently prevents\r\nit, in the interest of the national banks, from redeeming the bonds\r\ndeposited to secure national bank notes, out of its surplus income.\r\nStill it has great merit in giving us a safe and sound bank currency.\r\nUltimately this system, born of the civil war, will be superseded by a\r\nbetter one, but this will doubtless be done in a manner which will not\r\ninterfere with or impair vested interests.\r\n\r\nOwing to the short time now left of this session of Congress, nothing\r\nmore than the “Aldrich” bill can possibly be enacted at this time. Its\r\nsimplicity is a recommendation to Congress. But, nevertheless, Congress\r\nshould later pass a permanent currency bill, a bill which will settle\r\nevery question as to the finances of the nation, at once and for a\r\ncentury to come. Such a bill is possible, and in fact it would be the\r\nsimplest kind of measure for the Government to adopt—one to provide for\r\njust the kind of currency, and the amount of currency the business of\r\nthe nation, the banks, and the people should have; one to provide for a\r\nperfectly elastic currency without creating the slightest depreciation\r\nof money or danger of loss to banks or Government. It should provide a\r\nperfect way of obtaining money to move the crops, and furnish an\r\nall-sufficient means of preventing or breaking panics. It should make\r\nthe money of the United States still more current and acceptable in all\r\nparts of the world. This would make the nation greater in the eyes of\r\nother nations, and give the United States Treasury a proper command of\r\nthe commerce and finances of the world, within ten years after being put\r\ninto operation.\r\n\r\nAll the Government need do to effect such change in the finances of the\r\ncountry, and to acquire all such advantages for the Government and the\r\npeople, in my opinion, is to wipe out the whole system of National Bank\r\nCurrency, and give such banks, or any banks, Government currency direct,\r\nupon the same securities and such other kinds of securities as the\r\nGovernment is willing to accept, and permit the banks to increase or\r\ndiminish the amount it obtains whenever the business of the banks\r\nrequires it; every bank to do no more than give sufficient security for\r\nthe money. The Government need do no more than to take the security and\r\nhand the bank the money. The Government should be paid for the use of\r\nthe money a low rate of interest, say one per cent. No bank should be\r\nrequired to pay more.\r\n\r\nThe credit of the Government will be all sufficient for the credit of\r\nthe currency, and every dollar of it would be perfectly secured by the\r\nsecurity given the Government for it by the banks. The issuing of the\r\nmoney by the Government under this system would not injure the credit of\r\nthe Government in the slightest degree. Banks should be allowed to\r\nincrease or diminish the amount of money they obtain in amounts which\r\ncan be decided by the law. Such a system would be satisfactory to all\r\nthe people, except the national banks. These banks have been given the\r\nprivilege of having their names on the money they issue long enough. The\r\nmoney of the banks has ever been Government money. The Government has\r\npromised to pay it if the banks did not, and has had the means of\r\npaying. Let the Government do as it should: issue all the money. Let it\r\nbe circulated by banks which give proper security for it. Enlarge the\r\nmeans of securing the Government, by accepting State and Municipal\r\nbonds, or even Railroad bonds, to the extent of say 50 per cent, and\r\nGovernment bonds for the other 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe amount of additional business this change in the finances of the\r\ncountry would make the Government, would be no greater than any other\r\nchange would make, and would be much less than what will be necessary if\r\nthe present bill before the Senate is passed. All the great work and\r\nexpense of settling up the affairs of broken national banks and paying\r\noff their notes will be stopped.\r\n\r\nThere would be no such things then for the Government to settle. The\r\nTreasury can be required by the law to keep all the currency issued for\r\nthe purpose, that may be taken up, distinct and separate from all\r\nTreasury receipts from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the panic ordeal of 1907 that the New York banks passed\r\nthrough was reflected in the issue to them by the New York Clearing\r\nHouse, on and after October 22d, of, in all, a hundred millions of loan\r\ncertificates, although the largest amount of these outstanding at any\r\none time was eighty-four millions. This form of banking relief is purely\r\nAmerican and has never been adopted in Europe. The maximum issue of\r\nClearing House loan certificates in the panic of 1893 was $41,690,000,\r\nand in the panic of 1873 $26,565,000. But in 1893 New York bank deposits\r\nwere only $400,000,000; in 1907 they were $1,050,000,000, exclusive of\r\nTrust Companies. The maximum of certificates in 1907 was reached in the\r\nthird week of November, but the Clearing House banks showed their\r\nlargest deficit in reserve—$54,100,000—in the first week in November.\r\nSimultaneously the loan certificates issued by the Boston Clearing House\r\nreached their largest aggregate, $11,995,000. It is noteworthy also that\r\nthree powerful New York banks then held one-third of all the loan\r\ncertificates issued by the New York Clearing House. One of these held\r\n$13,500,000; another $10,000,000; and the third $7,500,000. The obvious\r\nobject of this was to enable the strong banks to loan a part of their\r\ncash reserves to weak associates.\r\n\r\nThe Clearing House Committee and the New York banks individually and\r\ncollectively did splendid work in mitigating as far as possible the\r\neffects of the panic, while the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.\r\nCortelyou, rendered very valuable service by co-operating with the\r\nnational banks to reduce the monetary stringency through large Treasury\r\ndeposits and facilitating the importation of gold.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan and several other private bankers also rendered praiseworthy\r\nservice during the panic, and my firm did its part by loaning to the\r\nmembers of the Stock Exchange, at the most critical period, three\r\nmillion dollars at moderate rates of interest.\r\n\r\nThe New York Clearing House is a non-incorporated association, but its\r\nreserve is the foundation for an enormous amount of the country’s\r\ncommercial credit. Of course, the banks and others holding practically\r\nunsalable collateral for loans, that the borrowers were unable to repay,\r\nwere forced to help the borrowers and save themselves from loss by\r\ncontinuing to hold them through the crisis for a better market. There\r\nwere many cases of this kind, particularly among the Trust Companies,\r\nand there has been much slow and careful after-panic liquidation of such\r\ncollateral, and much of it has still to be done. It is, however, being\r\nfacilitated by the decided improvement that has taken place in the\r\nmarket for first-class bonds.\r\n\r\nCapitalists who for the past two or three years had been dissatisfied\r\nwith the returns of ordinary investments and who had gone into hazardous\r\nspeculations and extensive underwriting of new bond issues in the hope\r\nof large and quick profits, have been sobered by their heavy losses and\r\nare now seeking safety in prime investment bonds.\r\n\r\nHad the market for bonds not improved as it has, it would have been\r\npractically impossible for the New York Central and other Railway\r\nCompanies to have marketed the large amount of notes they have succeeded\r\nin selling since the beginning of this year. The after effects of the\r\npanic, as well as the panic itself, would also have been far worse than\r\nanything we have witnessed had it not been for the previous heavy\r\nstock-market liquidation, a liquidation that in many cases had been\r\npractically continuous from the end of 1906, and that was most drastic\r\nand disastrous in August, 1907.\r\n\r\nThat the banking situation has become normal is indicated by the\r\nelimination of loan certificates and the resumption of normal methods by\r\nall the Clearing Houses in the United States, and particularly by the\r\nresumption of the weekly detailed bank statements by the New York\r\nClearing House. This occurred on February 8th for the first time after\r\ntheir suspension on October 26, 1907, and was supplemented by statements\r\nof the non-Clearing House banks and Trust Companies, including actual as\r\nwell as average conditions. This last is a new and commendable feature,\r\nwhich every Saturday will enable us to learn how all the banking\r\ninstitutions in New York City and its several boroughs stand, both\r\nindividually and collectively, in their average and their actual\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThat we are assured of a superabundance of money at low rates of\r\ninterest is evident from the large and growing accumulations of surplus\r\nfunds in the banks from Maine to California, and the light demand. All\r\nthe indications favor a protracted period of extreme ease in the money\r\nmarket, modified only by gold exports and the withdrawal by the\r\nGovernment, from time to time, of some and probably a large part of its\r\ndeposits in national banks. This again reminds us that the Sub-Treasury\r\nsystem makes the Government an unlimited hoarder of money, with only\r\nevil results. This, alone, calls for its modification.\r\n\r\nBut while the large aggregate of the surplus funds of the banks\r\ntestifies to the return of confidence, and with it the return to banking\r\nchannels of hoarded money, it also reflects the dullness of trade and\r\nmuch idle machinery and unemployed labor. Hence the bank clearings of\r\nthe United States in January were twenty-five per cent less than in\r\nJanuary, 1907. This condition of affairs has been and still is severely\r\nfelt by the Railways, whose largely reduced gross and net earnings and\r\nlong lines of empty cars tell why a number of them, like many industrial\r\ncorporations, have reduced or passed their dividends, or paid them in\r\nscrip. More railway and industrial corporations will probably have to\r\naccommodate themselves to circumstances and do likewise in consequence\r\nof reduced earnings. That we expect, and are prepared for, while the\r\ntrade depression lasts, and hence we all hope and trust it will be\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we cannot ignore the political situation in this Presidential\r\nyear, and the disturbing and depressing effect of the recent message of\r\nPresident Roosevelt to Congress, with its onslaught on Wall Street,\r\nfollowed by the unjust bitter attack of Mr. Bryan on Stock Exchange\r\nspeculation, which he denounced as gambling. Wall Street was thus ground\r\nbetween the upper and nether millstones of the Republican and the\r\nDemocratic parties; it was fired on from both sides with hot shot, grape\r\nand canister, without any good reason.\r\n\r\nSpeculation in stocks, as conducted through Stock Exchange brokers, is\r\nno more gambling than speculation in real estate or ordinary\r\nmerchandise. All trade is more or less speculative because it involves\r\nrisks. If it did not involve risk there would not be so many mercantile\r\nfailures as there are every year, yet no one calls trade gambling. Every\r\ntime a merchant buys a line of goods, he makes a venture, not knowing\r\nwhether they will rise or depreciate in market value on his hands. He\r\nbuys also on credit, just as he gives credit to his customers; and what\r\nis the difference in principle between this form of credit and the\r\ncredit a stock broker gives his customers who pay ten per cent on the\r\npar value of their purchases while the broker provides the balance and\r\nholds the stocks as security? This is the margin, which is a credit in\r\nthe account of each of them; and I call it a credit instead of a margin,\r\nwhich is a better word for brokers to use.\r\n\r\nThe present anti-speculation crusade is accompanied by many delusions\r\nand very imperfect ideas concerning the conditions and equities of\r\nbusiness operations. Who is to decide which are speculative transactions\r\nand which are not? Business cannot be conducted without making contracts\r\nentering into the future, and that is speculation. The builder who\r\ncontracts to build you a home is a speculator; the manufacturer who\r\nagrees to deliver a thousand cases of cotton goods sixty days hence is\r\ndealing in futures, and all operations extending into the future are\r\nunavoidably of a speculative character. Even marriage is often called a\r\nlottery. It is quite impossible and thoroughly stupid to try to\r\neliminate speculation, for it is an essential element in all business\r\ntransactions, except those for cash. If business were reduced to the\r\nlatter basis, it would soon become injuriously restricted and more\r\nexposed to corners and violent fluctuations than ever.\r\n\r\nAs to legitimate or illegitimate speculation, who is to decide between\r\nthe two, and where is the line to be drawn? If the investor buys\r\nsecurities in advance of his income, expecting to complete the purchase\r\nlater on, is that legitimate? Suppose circumstances compel him to change\r\nhis mind and sell before his original purchase is completed, is that\r\nlegitimate? And in what respect does such a transaction differ from the\r\nordinary marginal contract? It may, perhaps, differ in intent; for the\r\nspeculator usually buys with a view to taking advantage of temporary\r\nfluctuations. Yet, who would be bold enough to investigate the\r\nintentions of buyers or sellers? Only the most drastic kind of force\r\ncould compel divulgence of such secrets, and is it possible to establish\r\nany such system of espionage in this country? Speculation, as often\r\nstated in these advices, when confined to reasonable limits is\r\nbeneficial. It is the natural balance wheel of commerce and finance. By\r\nits means and through the conflict of opinion between buyers and sellers\r\nreal values are established by simpler and more reliable means than by\r\nany other known methods. No Government investigation will ever ascertain\r\nthe real value of our railroads so well as the higgling and bargaining\r\nbetween buyers and sellers, which is alike the moving spirit of commerce\r\nand the arbiter of values on all Stock Exchanges the world over.\r\nSpeculation is liable to be carried to excess, and abuses in speculative\r\nmethods undoubtedly exist; but these are better corrected by a strong\r\nand elevated public opinion than through any legal measures based upon\r\npolitical claptrap. There is a flood of nonsense in this campaign\r\nagainst speculation, anti-option, etc., which does not find believers\r\nhere but may in other parts of the country. It consists very largely of\r\npolitical humbug, and is nothing more than one of the usual methods by\r\nwhich crafty politicians play upon the ignorance and prejudice of the\r\nmasses for their own advantage. After the elections this mania will\r\nprobably pass away, to be then recognised as one of the psychological\r\nfeatures usually following a panic. Previous instances of this sort of\r\nagitation were the granger and populist movement, which exhibited many\r\nof the present symptoms of political insanity. Nevertheless, such\r\nagitation may do serious harm, and its fallacies should be fearlessly\r\nexposed in order to prevent the people from being deceived and misled.\r\nEven now this agitation, especially us manifested in hostile State\r\nLegislatures, is seriously interfering with that restoration of\r\nconfidence that is absolutely necessary to business recovery. It is\r\nkeeping both capital and labor idle. Capital is proverbially timid, and\r\nuntil such attacks cease enterprise is sure to be more or less\r\nrepressed. Of course there are abuses that need rectifying, but it is\r\nfolly to carry restraint to the point of extinction. Because a few\r\nindividuals play golf to harmful excess, would any sane person suppress\r\nso wholesome a sport? Yet that is precisely the policy of many of the\r\nreformers of the present day. Too frequently these reform movements\r\nsavor of ignorance. Their purpose is frequently admirable; but the\r\ncountry sadly needs more sanity in their application.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt condemns “options” very vigorously, as if they were\r\nnow dealt in on the Stock Exchange, as they once were, ranging from\r\nthree to sixty days; but they have not been traded in there for many\r\nyears, all purchases and sales of stock being deliverable and receivable\r\non the day following the transactions on the floor of the Exchange,\r\nexcept those specifically for “cash,” which means, to be delivered and\r\nreceived the same day. But on the Cotton, Produce and Coffee Exchanges,\r\nand Chicago Board of Trade, nearly all the transactions are in\r\n“futures”—and these are a boon to cotton and grain growers and coffee\r\nimporters, who, through them, can sell their growing crops and\r\nimportations months before they actually possess and are ready to\r\ndeliver them, so in advance making sure of the prices they will get for\r\ntheir farm products and importations.\r\n\r\nThis is speculation, yet perfectly legitimate, and I think that if\r\nPresident Roosevelt and Mr. Bryan knew more about these markets and the\r\nN. Y. Stock Exchange from actual experience, they would see the\r\ninjustice of much that they have said in decrying the evils of\r\nspeculation. Black sheep and exceptional wrongdoing should not be held\r\nup as examples of all and everything in Wall Street; and because\r\nunscrupulous men sometimes embezzle in order to get money to speculate\r\nwith, Wall Street should not be held responsible for their crime, any\r\nmore than a river should be blamed for a man’s suicide because he jumps\r\ninto it to end his troubles. There is nothing illegal or against public\r\nwelfare in a broker buying and selling stocks and bonds for his\r\ncustomers in conformity with the rules of the N. Y. Stock Exchange, nor\r\ncan there ever be; and I know that such business is just as honorable\r\nand legitimate as the buying and selling of iron, dry goods or real\r\nestate on credit. It is credit that keeps alive the business world.\r\n\r\nThe attacks on the financial center of this country are indiscriminate,\r\nand I am sorry that President Roosevelt, who has done so much good in\r\nother respects, should have nipped the bud of reviving confidence in the\r\nstock market in the way he did, for his denunciation of Wall Street,\r\ncoupled with Mr. Bryan’s wholesale and wild condemnation of the Stock\r\nExchange, led to a renewal of liquidation in the stock market, and a\r\nfresh decline in prices through creating fresh distrust of their\r\nholdings among investors.\r\n\r\nThe New York Stock Exchange is a great national and international\r\nmarket, and its 1100 members compose a very honorable and wealthy body\r\nof men, whose integrity in all their business transactions is\r\nunquestioned. They are bound not only by the rules of the Stock Exchange\r\nto be absolutely honorable and strictly honest in their dealings, but\r\ntheir own interests and their relations with their fellow members and\r\ntheir customers compel them to be so, and to be also above suspicion.\r\nSummary punishment, even to expulsion from membership, would follow any\r\ndishonorable or dishonest act on the part of any of them, and such\r\ninstances are of extremely rare occurrence. It is therefore unjust to\r\nstigmatize these men, these bankers and brokers of good business\r\nstanding and good social position, in the manner they have been\r\nstigmatized recently by Mr. Bryan; and again I think that if he knew\r\nWall Street better than he does he would have been more discriminating,\r\nand would have confined his severest criticism to the speculative\r\ncapitalists who have probably at times abused the Stock Exchange by the\r\nmanipulation of stocks.\r\n\r\nThe so-called practice of “washing” is strictly prohibited by the rules\r\nof the Stock Exchange, but as it is very hard to detect and prove, in\r\nsome instances, doubtless it may possibly have gone unpunished. The\r\nStock Exchange, however, earnestly endeavors to ferret out and prevent\r\nand severely punish all violations of its rules.\r\n\r\nAfter every great panic, the Stock Exchange has been made a scape-goat,\r\nand unjustly assailed as the main cause of the trouble. The fact however\r\nthat the two great opposing forces in national politics are now united\r\nin their attacks upon Wall Street is unusual, and foreshadows more\r\nattacks of the same disturbing character during the presidential\r\ncampaign. This is a depressing factor in both the financial and trade\r\nsituation, and we see evidence of it in all directions. It is, of\r\ncourse, a factor that retards recovery from the crisis by retarding the\r\ngrowth of confidence, and how far its influence will extend we have yet\r\nto see. But of one thing we may be sure, and that is, we shall be\r\nreminded of it very forcibly from time to time from the batteries on\r\nboth sides of the political battle ground until after the November\r\nelection; then the guns will cease to belch their thunder. Hence we must\r\nbe prepared for it in the interval and make the best of it, remembering\r\nthe old adage-“Forewarned, Forearmed.” But never before has politics\r\nhurled its javelins so fiercely against Wall Street, and that\r\npractically means all the Stock Exchanges in the country. The joint\r\nattack is against stock speculation, and no Stock Exchange in the world\r\never was or ever can be free from that. It would obviously be absolutely\r\nimpossible to distinguish investment from speculative transactions on\r\nthe floor of the Stock Exchange, or tell whether long or short stock was\r\nbeing bought and sold. Because speculative capitalists in control of\r\nlarge corporations have managed them dishonestly for their own benefit,\r\nand in furthering their schemes and speculations employed stock brokers\r\nand used the Stock Exchange, it and its members should not be held\r\nresponsible for the wrongdoing of these men, as it is a market open to\r\nall the world, just as is the London Stock Exchange or any Bourse in\r\nContinental Europe. To restrict its scope and operations by law would be\r\nto lessen its usefulness to investors and corporations issuing\r\nsecurities, and destroy its utility as a free market for all.\r\n\r\nWall Street being not only a local but a national and international\r\nfinancial center, the whole world, not only the whole country, is\r\ntributary to it, and it is indispensable to the whole country. Yet it is\r\nmade the target at present for all sorts of political abuse, and various\r\nschemes have been urged for suppressing trading in stocks, all of which\r\nare of course chimerical, for as long as we have securities, there must,\r\nin justice to the millions of holders, be a market for them. Without it\r\nthere would be a sort of chaos of confusion and abnormal prices, for it\r\nis the speculator who is often the most keen and discriminating in\r\njudging the true value of securities. The much maligned “bear” is the\r\nsafety valve of the market. He often prevents the manipulation of the\r\nprice of a stock to an unfairly high figure by exposing the weak points\r\nin the situation, which is a protection to a prospective buyer.\r\n\r\nA great deal of shallow abuse is still being showered on the Stock\r\nExchange from all parts of the country. This always follows a panic. It\r\npleases a certain class of ignorant and misguided people to hear Wall\r\nStreet denounced and maligned on every opportunity. It matters little\r\nwhether the accusations are right or wrong. So pessimistic is public\r\nopinion that the worse the charges the more numerous the believers. No\r\none looks on the other side; no one is told of the manifold services and\r\nadvantages of Wall Street as a financial center. No one is taught that\r\nWall Street is merely a central market for capital, just as Chicago is\r\nfor wheat, Boston for wool, New Orleans for cotton, etc. How many\r\nappreciate the fact that Wall Street is as essential to the business\r\nlife of the country as is the Legislature at Washington to our political\r\nlife? How many realize that Wall Street is the primary nerve center of\r\nthe American business world; that a blow struck there is an injury to\r\nthe whole financial and business fabric of the nation? How many forget\r\nthat in Wall Street the investor can deal with greater advantage to\r\nhimself, as a rule, than in any other financial market? How many\r\nunderstand that there the country can best settle its accounts; send its\r\nsavings, and make its investments more readily and on better terms than\r\nanywhere else? The very individuals who most violently abuse Wall Street\r\nare often among the first to go there for financing new enterprises or\r\nto pick up cheap investments. Thither, also, these same grumblers hasten\r\nin order to “get rich quickly.” When they succeed nothing is heard about\r\nthe “wickedness” of Wall Street, and they flatter themselves as to their\r\nown superior shrewdness. But when these same individuals lose, then Wall\r\nStreet is nothing but a “gambling hell and a cesspool of iniquity.” They\r\nfail to recognize that their losses are the result of their own\r\ncupidity, or inability to discriminate between sound and unsound\r\ninvestments. They usually lose because of their own bad judgment; but\r\nnevertheless, there is no end to their objurgations.\r\n\r\nNow Wall Street after all is little different from any other department\r\nof business and industry. Its makeup naturally includes men with similar\r\nfailings and similar impulses to good and evil that exist everywhere;\r\nmen who are better than the politicians who make capital by abusing Wall\r\nStreet; men who are better than some of the trusts or the unions which\r\naim to selfishly and often relentlessly grasp all within their power. It\r\nmay also include a very few who unscrupulously manipulate property for\r\ntheir own advantage and at every opportunity. But it also includes a\r\nvast majority of men of high principles, of great foresight and of\r\nenlightened self-interest; men who recognize that their own welfare is\r\ndependent upon their regard for the welfare of others. Most of such men\r\nare rarely heard of, and their good deeds and honorable achievements are\r\nnot exploited in the daily press, which is naturally interested in the\r\nsearch for the abnormal. Wall Street probably contains a much larger\r\npercentage of strong brainy men than any other community, because right\r\nthere centers the management of large affairs and great organizations\r\nwhich demand the highest ability. True, Wall Street attracts some men of\r\nunscrupulous and predatory instincts because of the great opportunities\r\nfor accumulating wealth by devious and often improper methods. The\r\noccasional flotation of questionable schemes and the improper use of\r\nfunds held in trust undoubtedly are sometimes among the greatest evils\r\nconnected with Wall Street. They are evils that its best men are most\r\nanxious to see eliminated, and it is satisfactory to know that strong\r\nefforts are being made in this direction. It cannot be too strongly\r\nstated that many of the abuses which aggravated the late panic could not\r\nbe repeated, and have been stopped forever. Whatever defects remain, the\r\nbusiness standards of Wall Street are upon a distinctly higher plane\r\nthan existed some time ago. In spite of troubles and pessimism the world\r\nis growing better and better. But so long as fools with money are to be\r\nfound, just so long will there be sharpers ready to take the one and\r\nleave the other. It is useless to expect the millennium. Human nature\r\nchanges slowly, and the only means of checking abuses is to establish\r\nrules and standards of a high order, and to keep alive a public opinion\r\nthat will insist upon their enforcement. An alert and vigorous public\r\nopinion is often more effective in preventing evil than the punitive\r\nmeasures which are applied after the wrong has been done.\r\n\r\nNo king, on being crowned, was ever prouder or happier than I, when I\r\nfirst stepped on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a newly\r\nelected member. The pride that I felt at that time has grown and\r\nincreased every year since that day, so long ago, as I have seen the\r\nExchange grow in influence and moral power. There is no body of men in\r\nthe world superior to the members of our Exchange in honor, integrity\r\nand truthfulness. Every transaction on the floor is done on word of\r\nmouth. Sales involving millions of dollars are consummated without a\r\nscrap of writing, and it is a rare occurrence that even a dispute arises\r\nover a transaction, and even then, unless a witness can be found to the\r\ntransaction, the matter is settled usually by each party assuming\r\none-half the loss, as both the buyer and the seller know that the other\r\nis just as square and honest as he is, and that the dispute is over a\r\nmisunderstanding and not a misrepresentation. Many people are wont to\r\nworry over the nervous strain under which their friends in the Stock\r\nExchange are laboring in busy times. Their worry is unnecessary, as the\r\nbusy time on the “Street” is the happy time. Many people pretend to be\r\nshocked at the want of dignity which prompts the members to skylark and\r\nact like boys. Don’t be shocked. This is the recreation which offsets\r\nthe strain and keeps the members young. One of the most impressive\r\nscenes that can be witnessed is viewed from the gallery on the morning\r\nof a very busy day. At five minutes to 10 the members are seen quietly\r\ngathering in little groups around the different “posts,” chatting and\r\nsmiling—at 10 o’clock exactly a gong sounds which announces that\r\nbusiness can begin. Every man on the floor commences to yell and paw the\r\nair, and one who did not understand would think that he was watching the\r\nworking room of bedlam. But if he watches closely he will see that order\r\nreigns in seeming chaos. Automatic signals on the walls, quickly moving\r\npages and telephone clerks in the booths at the side of the Exchange\r\nroom, all work in harmony, and the great machinery “moves in a\r\nmysterious way its wonders to perform.” Almost everything in the\r\ncountry, yes in the world, has its influence in this great market. The\r\ngrains of wheat, the kernels of corn, the bolls of cotton, the chinch\r\nbug and the boll weevil: each has a vote. The miner deep in the bowels\r\nof the earth and the crew on a swiftly moving railroad train, the track\r\nwalker and the laborer are all exercising indirectly an influence. All\r\nthe great railroads and industrial corporations come to Wall Street in\r\ntheir time of need, and if their object is worthy they do not leave with\r\ntheir wants unsupplied. Wall Street proper, as represented through the\r\nNew York Stock Exchange, is the barometer of the country. Every man,\r\nwoman or child who has a dollar invested or deposited in a savings bank\r\nis interested in the good or bad times which prevail in the Street. In\r\ntimes of great disaster or need, the members of the Exchange are the\r\nleaders in contributing to the relief of the afflicted. There is a lot\r\nof good in Wall Street that outsiders know nothing of; if you are one of\r\nthem, find out the truth. Be sure to hear witnesses on both sides. Honor\r\nand truthfulness are the cornerstones on which the whole fabric of\r\nbusiness in Wall Street is built, and confidence is the keystone of the\r\narch that covers all transactions. The fact that a weak spot is\r\noccasionally uncovered proves the strength of the general structure.\r\nThere is no place in the world where the measure of confidence between\r\nemployer and employee is so large and where loyally to each other is so\r\nmarked. In whatever business a young man intends to embark, a year or\r\ntwo in Wall Street is a good training, as he will learn much that will\r\nbenefit him in after life. He would realize the necessity of close\r\nattention to work and the true application of the principles of the\r\nGolden Rule. In these times of reckless denunciation of Wall Street a\r\ngeneral application of this rule by those who attack by innuendo and\r\nwithout a scintilla of truth would help to restore confidence and give\r\nevidence of fair-mindedness on their part. Men in high places prefer\r\ncharges and the very wording of their complaint proves that they are\r\nbeyond the depth of their knowledge. Wall Street will survive all\r\nattacks, and the refutation of these attacks by well-meaning but\r\nmistaken men will in the long ran redound to its lasting good. This is a\r\ntime of trial by fire in both business and private life, and those who\r\nhave nothing to fear will come out of it unscathed, and the New York\r\nStock Exchange will be in the front rank of those declared guiltless and\r\nworthy.\r\n\r\nPossibly there are a few abuses undiscovered on the Stock Exchange that\r\nshould be remedied. Nevertheless, I affirm without fear of contradiction\r\nthat there is no business institution in the United States where\r\nstandards are as high or where the integrity of its members is equal to\r\nthat prevailing on the Stock Exchange. Therefore, let the people and our\r\nLegislatures come to their senses, and awake to the fact that in\r\nstriking at the financial district they are hurting themselves quite as\r\nmuch as those whom they seek to destroy, and that the evil transactions\r\nare small in comparison with the good. Let them understand that in\r\nfomenting discontent of this sort they are intensifying the general\r\ndepression, adding to the number of unemployed, driving capital into\r\nhiding and generally interfering with that recovery in commerce and\r\nindustry which is now so earnestly desired. The present antipathy to\r\nWall Street savors largely of public hysteria, bogyphobia and political\r\ndementia. Apparently, it is a disease which must run its course; if so,\r\nthe best cure will be a period of reflection in which to cultivate\r\ncalmer and more rational views.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Wall Street is being riddled with hot shot, the\r\nrailways are being harassed by State legislation, involving low rates,\r\nand projects are on foot that in effect would prevent their development\r\nto meet the wants of the people. All this is oppressive and inimical to\r\nthe national welfare, and I advocate as a remedy removing the interstate\r\nrailways from the control of the States, and placing them entirely under\r\nthe control of the United States Government. This Congress can and\r\nshould do promptly.\r\n\r\nAnother great difficulty the railways and other large employers of labor\r\nnow have to contend with is the refusal or unwillingness of the Labor\r\nUnions to consent to a reduction of wages to meet reduced earnings. A\r\nlowering of wages has become absolutely necessary, for they are still at\r\nthe high figures to which they were pushed during the long period of\r\nprosperity. They are at a boom level that railway and manufacturing\r\ncorporations cannot afford to pay in these altered times. The Labor\r\nUnions should recognize this at once, and reduce their wage scales, and\r\nnot wait until they are forced to yield. Moreover, they should see that\r\nwith reduced wages a larger number of men could be profitably employed\r\nthan is possible with wages as they are, and in this way the ranks of\r\nthe unemployed would be reduced. This of itself would be of great\r\nbenefit to both the working men and their employers, as well as to the\r\ncountry at large. It is a time when common sense should be brought into\r\nplay in the adjustment of means to ends in wages as well as other\r\nmatters, for the more it is the quicker will be recovery from the\r\neffects of the panic, and the less will be the suffering from industrial\r\ndepression by labor as well as capital. This in the concrete means that\r\nit would result in there being fewer workmen in actual want, and fewer\r\ncorporations going to the wall. It is one of the great remedies that the\r\nsituation now calls for.\r\n\r\nA general reduction of wages would to almost a certainty cause some\r\nmills that have closed to reopen, and cause others that are running on\r\npart time to run on full time. The advent of Spring will of course tend\r\nto stimulate recovery, so we shall have the help of Nature to repair\r\ndamages. With Nature as an ally, we ought to rapidly overcome all\r\nobstacles in the way of complete recuperation.\r\n\r\nReadjustment of existing conditions is the order of the day, and where\r\nthere’s a will there’s a way, as we all know. The general reduction that\r\nhas taken place in the price of commodities, and to some extent in\r\nrents, furnishes a very good reason of itself why wages should be\r\nreduced from the high points to which they climbed to meet high prices.\r\nAs it is, the inequality between wages and prices is very conspicuous,\r\nand equality should be restored as quickly as possible. Equality is\r\nanother name for justice. It is also the touchstone of taxation. Workmen\r\nshould not forget that even half a loaf is better than no bread, and\r\nthat by accepting reduced wages they are paving the way to better times\r\nfor themselves as well as for the country. Then, too, they owe a duty to\r\nsociety at large. No one should be governed by the narrow, selfish\r\npolicy of living for himself alone. This is a world in which we must\r\ngive and take, and labor and capital have mutual interests.\r\n\r\nThe decline in commodity prices, that were before excessive, has been\r\nsalutary and of vast benefit in bringing the necessaries of life within\r\neasier reach of the wage-earning masses, and in preventing many\r\nindustries from going from bad to worse, through cheapening their\r\nsupplies of raw material. The people generally, as consumers, benefit by\r\nthis reduction in the cost of production, and in turn it tends to\r\nincrease consumption and quicken trade and manufacturing enterprise. All\r\nthese influences, too, toad to strengthen confidence in the situation\r\nand hope for the future. But the over-trading, extravagance and\r\nexcessive speculation that primarily led to the panic should be\r\ncarefully guarded against in the future.\r\n\r\nThe very severe and extensive liquidation that we have witnessed, not\r\nonly in Wall Street but all over the country, has made the financial\r\nsituation sounder and therefore safer than it has been for several\r\nyears, for it must be confessed that many of our speculative captains of\r\nindustry and finance passed far beyond the bounds of conservatism in\r\ntheir operations, and invited the crisis we experienced by their\r\nreckless assumption of inordinate risks and liabilities.\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting retribution when some of them were engulfed by it.\r\nEspecially culpable and dangerous to the public were those speculative\r\ncapitalists who sought and gained control of chains of important\r\nnational banks, and then used their resources to extend their own\r\nhazardous speculative schemes. These men were really the immediate cause\r\nof the crisis, and they are now deservedly paying the penalty for it.\r\nBut this is a small consideration in comparison with the enormous amount\r\nof havoc they created. One good thing, however, has come out of so much\r\nevil, and that is improvement in our banking condition, by the exposure\r\nand eradication of this unsound banking that prevailed in New York, and\r\nto some extent elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe shall, in this generation at least, have no more such speculators\r\nstepping into control of large New York banks and using them pretty much\r\nas if they, their assets and deposits, were their own property. Those\r\nresponsible for this unsound banking were public enemies, and we are\r\nstill feeling the effects of their reckless and illegal proceedings. The\r\nfact that several of them are now under indictment for their offences is\r\na reminder that the way of the transgressor is hard. Their elimination\r\nfrom the banking world removed a source of great danger, which might, if\r\nallowed to continue longer, have resulted in a far worse state of things\r\nthan they actually created before their career was brought to a close.\r\n\r\nA salutary effect of the panic is the check it has given to extravagance\r\nand waste in living expenses, and the practical lesson in economy that\r\nit has taught very many, for economy is wealth. To reduce expenses after\r\nbusiness reverses is the best way to recuperate, and a little adversity\r\nis not without its uses among us, for we are beyond question the most\r\nextravagant people in the world. This extravagance in living has been\r\nthe prime cause of much of the “graft” evil that has lowered the tone of\r\nour business and political life, to say nothing of abuses of power,\r\nembezzlements, corporation-looting, and other forms of dishonesty.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt in his war against illegal and dishonest corporate\r\npractices has certainly worked for the good of the country and to raise\r\nthe standard of business morality; and the life insurance, railway and\r\nother corporate scandals that we are all familiar with have shown how\r\nmuch reform and purification were needed even in high places. Let us\r\nnever forget, as the Bible tells us, that “Righteousness exalteth a\r\nnation” however great may be its material prosperity.\r\n\r\nThat there is a very large amount of money lying idle and available for\r\ninvestment in first-class bonds was conspicuously shown by the result of\r\nthe sale by the City of New York on February 14th of fifty millions of\r\nfour and a half per cent bonds, when three hundred millions were bid\r\nfor, at an average price of about 104¾. This oversubscription of six\r\ntimes the amount offered came from people who would not have touched any\r\nbut gilt-edge securities.\r\n\r\nOf course, the present cheapness of money accounts for much of this\r\nlarge New York subscription, as apart from investors, banks and bankers\r\nare seeking safe employment for their surplus, in securities that can be\r\npromptly marketed on the Stock Exchange whenever necessary. The latter\r\nis an indispensable condition with them, particularly now in view of the\r\nnational banks being enormously indebted to the Government in the shape\r\nof Treasury deposits, and also in view of the future needs of the\r\nGovernment calling for their return. This is already giving a hardening\r\ntendency to time money.\r\n\r\nAlthough trade is largely prostrated through inactivity, it is safe to\r\nsay, notwithstanding what is bad in the situation, that fundamental\r\nconditions are generally sound, and therefore recovery while gradual\r\nwill be the easier for it. Meanwhile with inactivity forced upon us, let\r\nus be masterly in our inactivity, and make a virtue of necessity. There\r\nis much in knowing when to stop and when to go ahead; when to ’bout ship\r\nand when to take in sail, and double reef the mainsail and the topsails,\r\nor heave to, and when to sail under bare poles or a full spread of\r\ncanvas. Skillful navigation is necessary to success.\r\n\r\nWith regard to bank reserves, it is especially important during this\r\nperiod of depression that they should be kept exceptionally strong and\r\nas much as possible, within reasonable limits, above the required\r\npercentage. Twenty-five per cent of reserve against deposits in the\r\ncentral reserve cities, and especially in New York, is not always\r\nsufficient, as we have seen, from time to time, to enable the banks\r\nthere to weather a storm.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England maintains an average reserve of nearly twenty-five\r\nper cent larger than that; and it is guarded from suspension in times of\r\npanic by a suspension of the bank act by the Government, which allows it\r\nto issue its notes ad libitum without any compulsory reserve. Here are\r\ntwo elements of safety. The stronger in reserve the banks keep\r\nthemselves, the more confidence in them and in the situation will be\r\nstrengthened, and the stronger confidence becomes, the more enterprise\r\ncan build upon it. So the banks by their conservatism should do all they\r\ncan to encourage confidence as the prime requisite in recuperation.\r\n\r\nThe New York banks, holding as they do largely the reserves of other\r\nbanks throughout the country, should hold a reserve nearer to that of\r\nthe Bank of England, which is also the depository of the reserve of\r\nother banks, but in a much larger proportion. If the New York banks had\r\nheld thirty per cent reserve last October, when the Knickerbocker Trust\r\nCompany failed, there might have been no necessity for issuing Clearing\r\nHouse certificates, and in that case there would have been no hoarding\r\nof money and little or no panic. But the banks are naturally desirous of\r\nmaking money by keeping their loans and discounts at high figures, so\r\nthey are apt to look upon reserves above the legal limit as money\r\nwasted. The legal limit, however, is too low in the central reserve\r\ncities. My remedy is to raise it. It ought, in my opinion, to be at\r\nleast thirty per cent instead of twenty-five per cent, and apart from\r\nany legal requirement, the New York Clearing House should adopt a rule\r\nrequiring the banks in the Association to keep a reserve of thirty per\r\ncent. The banks would lose a little in profits by this change, but they\r\nwould gain in safety, and reduce our liability to panics. Their\r\nexperience during the crisis, when for ten weeks, until the end of\r\nDecember, currency loaned at a premium ranging from two per cent to five\r\nper cent, should make them anxious to avoid another such ordeal, and an\r\nounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\r\n\r\nOne unpleasant part of the aftermath of the panic in New York was the\r\nfailure in one week, at the end of January, notwithstanding that they\r\nheld five millions of loan certificates, of four banks belonging to the\r\nClearing House, because of runs on their deposits, and the refusal of\r\nthe Clearing House to give them further assistance. Whether or not any\r\nof these will be able to resume is still undetermined. Yet, in sharp\r\ncontrast with the excitement and alarm that prevailed for weeks after\r\nthe Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, the public regarded these\r\nfailures with apathy, and the recovery in the stock market which was\r\nthen in progress, chiefly under the covering of short contracts, was not\r\neven checked by it, so much had sentiment changed in the interval. These\r\nfailures had been practically discounted, large as they were, by what\r\nhad gone before, including the decline in stocks. Yet collectively they\r\nhad more than twenty-one thousand depositors. These may eventually be\r\npaid in full, but it is very uncertain when that will be, for the law is\r\na slow coach, especially when a permanent receivership is fastened upon\r\na bank, largely owing to the long wait usually necessary for the\r\nconversion of slow assets into cash. Moreover, the expenses of\r\nliquidation eat up a large part of the assets under the system of fees\r\nfor receivers and their counsel, which have always been much too large\r\nfor the work done, and consequently they involve injustice to the\r\ncreditors. Laws should therefore be passed substituting for fees fixed\r\nrates of compensation, per diem, for both of these, that is salaries;\r\nand meanwhile the courts should, under the existing laws, reduce their\r\nfees to reasonable amounts, and so correct this evil of extravagance in\r\nthe cost of liquidation, which in some instances has been so excessive\r\nas to practically amount to robbery of the victims. This is a needed\r\nremedy that should be urged upon State legislatures.\r\n\r\nTwo of these failed banks are expected to resume within six months,\r\nwhile the other two will be wound up, and probably pay depositors forty\r\nper cent or fifty per cent of their claims within about that length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately, however, the crisis of 1907 was much less prolific of\r\nbank failures than that of either 1873 or 1893. In 1893 no fewer than\r\none hundred and fifty-eight banks suspended, and of these sixty-five\r\nwent into permanent receiverships, while eighty-six resumed within the\r\nyear, and seven later. But few of these banks had a capital of half a\r\nmillion or more, their average capitalization being only $169,000. The\r\nbanks generally in the fourteen years interval had gained immensely in\r\nstrength as well as in number, and their power of resistance to the\r\neffects of the crisis, when it came, had been correspondingly increased.\r\n\r\nWhile the profits of trade and manufacturing have been dwindling,\r\nprophets as to the future of business and prices have increased\r\nenormously, and they were never more numerous or more divided in opinion\r\nthan they are now. Some of them point to the fact that with the single\r\nexception of steel, in the hands of the United States Steel Corporation,\r\nprices have declined, and they argue that unless demand increases they\r\nwill, like stocks and wages, naturally go lower, and that the Steel\r\nCorporation will be forced, by the reductions already being made by the\r\nindependent steel makers as well as by the heavy decline in iron, to\r\nfollow suit. These also look for somewhat prolonged depression. But many\r\nother prophets are sanguine that we are already seeing the worst of it,\r\nand that commodity prices are about as low as they are likely to go. The\r\ntrue prophets are probably the conservatives who steer between these\r\nconflicting opinions and avoid both extremes. But whatever may come, on\r\nthe ebbing or rising tide, of our business life, we should, as\r\nLongfellow says, “Learn to labor and to wait, with a heart for any\r\nfate,” and at the same time hold ourselves always ready to make the best\r\nof our opportunities as they arise, and, as America is pre-eminently\r\nrich in opportunities, we shall not find them waiting long. In any\r\nevent, the wants of eighty-four millions of our people must be supplied,\r\nand we are the most progressive nation in the world. I therefore\r\nask—Who’s afraid?\r\n\r\nI am quite of the opinion that the time has arrived for calamity howling\r\nto cease; there is now no occasion for undue anxiety. Caution, however,\r\nmay be necessary, especially in commercial operations. The worst of the\r\nfinancial depression has been seen, and the long-distance view is\r\ncertainly more encouraging than at any time during the last six months.\r\nBusiness men have now no reason to feel otherwise than confident. I\r\nfirmly believe that recuperation will be quicker after the recent panic\r\nthan was experienced after any of the previous great panics since the\r\none of 1857.\r\n\r\nNow is the time for the timid to develop bravery, for the strong to aid\r\nthe weak, for the ignorant to be willing to learn from the wise. Let us\r\nall work together for the common good, and the upward tide will bear us\r\nall along towards better times and lasting prosperity. Panics come in\r\ncycles and it will be years before another one can strike us. Let the\r\nworker give his best services to his employer. Let the employer grant\r\njustice and fair pay to the worker and to all, and the nightmares and\r\nstorms of the past year will be forgotten or remembered only as a lesson\r\ntaught by experience, which will serve to teach us not to overdo in the\r\nfuture but to temper enterprise with conservatism.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\n        AMERICAN SOCIAL CONDITIONS.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  An address by Henry Clews, LL.D., to the students of Yale University,\r\n  New Haven, Conn., November 1, 1907.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman and Students of Yale University_:\r\n\r\nAs you gentlemen of good old Yale are studying American social\r\nconditions, I am glad to have the opportunity of addressing you, and I\r\ncongratulate you on the prestige you will derive from graduating at so\r\ngreat and famous a university. You are now on the threshold of American\r\ncitizenship and have good reason to be proud of the prospect before you,\r\nwith its unlimited possibilities.\r\n\r\nSurely it is a privilege that you all value, and can hardly overvalue,\r\nthat of becoming American citizens, and thus forming a part of this free\r\nand glorious Republic, where the gates of opportunity are thrown wide\r\nopen to you, and the golden harvest of success stands ready to be reaped\r\nby the worthy and deserving, who are able and willing to do good work,\r\nand work hard in their chosen calling. I may reasonably predict that\r\nsome of you will become leaders of thought, trade, science, literature\r\nor art, and that will be your ample reward. I base my prediction on the\r\nfact that you are not here because you are compelled to be, but because\r\nyou have a thirst for knowledge, for information, or suggestions that\r\nmay be of use to you in this connection, and are willing and anxious to\r\nwork hard to attain what you desire. The first requisite to attain\r\nsuccess in any form is this willingness to study and work for what you\r\nwant, so, being equipped with this necessary quality at the start, you\r\nare prepared to make headway in the battle of life.\r\n\r\nThe pessimist is abroad in this fair land of ours, in these days,\r\npreaching the gospel of discontent, and a favorite text is that the\r\nyoung man has now no show, or little chance to get on in life. Do not be\r\nmisled or discouraged by such a false doctrine. There never was a time\r\nwhen brains were at a greater premium than at present, nor courage,\r\neducation, industry, and energy more requisite or in greater demand. The\r\nharder you have to struggle to complete your education, the better\r\nfitted you will be for that battle of life, for in your youth you will\r\nhave attained victory over the obstacles which lie in the path of\r\nsuccess. Disappointments may embarrass you, but you must conquer them,\r\ninstead of allowing them to conquer you. Every victory, thus won, will\r\nbe an incentive to further efforts and achievements, and will provide a\r\nstepping stone to success.\r\n\r\nRight here, let me impress upon you that the foundation stones of real\r\nsuccess in life are industry, honesty, and truthfulness. These are\r\njewels which every man can possess, if he cares to. Do not be honest\r\nbecause it pays, or as a matter of policy. Be honest because you are\r\nconscientious, and it is right to be honest and a reproach to be\r\ndishonest. A man who is honest and truthful in all things is the highest\r\ntype of manhood, and commands respect in every walk of life.\r\n\r\nWhile you are still young, I advise you to have an ideal. Make up your\r\nmind what you are best suited for, and strive with all that is in you to\r\nperfect yourself for the work of such a position or profession. While it\r\nis the almost universal desire to become rich, remember that there are\r\nother things in life more to be desired than great wealth. Whether\r\namassed in Wall Street or elsewhere. Few of the great authors,\r\nscientists, professors, or inventors have been wealthy men, yet they\r\nwere great public benefactors, and their names will live in the pages of\r\nhistory long after the very rich men of the world have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nLearn well the history of your country. Study the science of Federal,\r\nState, and Municipal government. Study also finance and banking. Whether\r\nyou go into Wall Street or not, it will be useful to you. Before you\r\nleave Yale, try to inform yourselves on all the subjects that will make\r\nyou useful citizens, as well as competent, practical workers. School\r\nyourselves to be polite and courteous under trying circumstances.\r\nPoliteness is one of the strongest allies one can have in his dealings\r\nwith his fellow-men. It is not only so in my field of activity—Wall\r\nStreet—but everywhere.\r\n\r\nRead only good books. Libraries are now so plentiful that—even if you\r\nhave not one of your own—good books are within the reach of all, and\r\nhere at Yale you, of course, have an embarrassment of riches from the\r\nGreek and Latin classics to modern literature.\r\n\r\nWhile you are improving your minds, take good care of your bodies. You\r\nare not yet too old for me to give you points. Exercise all you can in\r\nthe open air. Cleanliness of body, and neatness of dress, even if you\r\nare not millionaires and your clothes are threadbare, will often be\r\ntaken as a guarantee of good character. Be thrifty and economical, even\r\nif you cannot equal Russell Sage, and never get into debt, if you can\r\nhelp it.\r\n\r\nStrive to learn to do some one thing, in the line of your studies,\r\nbetter than anyone else can do it, and you will have a specialty to\r\nrecommend you to a chosen career. Whatever you attempt to do, do it with\r\nyour whole soul—as Mr. Roosevelt, our strenuous and gifted President,\r\nsays: “Buck hard and hit the center of the line.”\r\n\r\nI have been much impressed with the manual training schools, which have\r\nrecently been established in New York City. I wish that manual training\r\ncould be added to the course in every school and college. Mr. Booker\r\nWashington has ably presented the plan in his Tuskegee Institution,\r\nwhere every man to get an education must learn a trade, and every man\r\nwho learns a trade gets an education. It is a substantial personal asset\r\nfor rich or poor.\r\n\r\nBecause you live in a city, do not think that the country is less\r\nattractive, and has no chance to grow like a town. The State of Texas\r\nalone could give to every man, woman, and child in the United States a\r\nfull-sized building lot 20 × 100, and then, allowing for public\r\nhighways, have over one-third of the area of the State left for the\r\nproduction of food supplies. The West, the Southwest, and the South, are\r\nyearning for newcomers. Horace Greeley used to say: “Go West, young\r\nman!” The emigrants from foreign shores will some day realize that there\r\nis a welcome ready for them outside of cities. Colonies will be formed\r\nand men of intelligence will be needed to rule and advise the newcomers;\r\nand those of you who can speak a foreign language will be well fitted\r\nfor such a position. But you may aspire to the United States Senate, or\r\nto become Wall Street millionaires.\r\n\r\nThe natural resources of our country are constantly being developed, and\r\nmen of brains and courage will be sought to lead the armies of workmen.\r\nEvery man cannot be a captain of industry, but a man of pluck and\r\neducation need not remain a private in the ranks very long. Still, avoid\r\nthat vaulting ambition that overleaps itself and falls on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWhatever your calling may be, try to become your own master in your\r\nyounger days. Nothing will give you so much self-reliance as the habit\r\nof relying on yourself. You may possibly fail at first, but great\r\nsuccesses are often built on failures, if the one who fails will profit\r\nby the lesson. Bulwer Lytton tells us that in the bright lexicon of\r\nYouth, there is no such word as Fail.\r\n\r\nWhen you graduate, do not imagine that your education is completed.\r\nConsider that you are just beginning to be able to learn, and that your\r\nCollege life has simply been a period of training to put you in\r\ncondition for the real struggle for knowledge. Practice makes perfect in\r\nall the professions.\r\n\r\nSee to it that you acquire some new point in knowledge every day that\r\nwill be of future value to you. This will mean 365 good ideas acquired\r\nin a year, and every one of these ideas will be like money out at\r\ninterest, or like seeds planted in good soil. They will blossom and bear\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nDo not believe that all men in politics are rascals, or weaklings, who\r\ncan be bought for a price. If you have the inclination, get into\r\npolitical life and be a factor in the affairs of your district. Honest\r\nand truthful men will be most welcome in this field, and may be of great\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nDo not be worried by the statements made by so many pessimists that\r\nsociety, and the country at large, are on the verge of moral bankruptcy.\r\nI tell you that the world is growing better every day, and good men are\r\nheld in higher respect than ever. Of course there are more rascals, and\r\nmore thieves, than there were fifty years ago, but that is because there\r\nare far more people. The percentage of bad to good is relatively\r\nsmaller. Men who do wrong are found out oftener and sooner than they\r\nwere in the olden days, and the news of wrongdoing is carried all over\r\nthe land by telegraph and telephone and published broadcast in the daily\r\npapers. A hundred years ago a man might commit a crime a thousand miles\r\nfrom New York and we could not get the news of it in a month, even if it\r\nwas sent at all.\r\n\r\nUse all your endeavors to suppress the use of profanity or obscenity in\r\npublic places or elsewhere. This is one of the crying evils of the day\r\nand our women are never safe from the insults of having to listen to\r\ntalk that would not be tolerated in a first-class barroom. But of course\r\nthe present company is excepted. You are all gentlemen and scholars.\r\n\r\nBe cheerful under adverse circumstances. Ella Wheeler Wilcox expresses\r\nwhat I mean when she says:\r\n\r\n                   “It’s easy enough to be pleasant,\r\n                    When life goes by like a song;\r\n                      But the man worth while\r\n                      Is the one who will smile\r\n                    When everything goes dead wrong.”\r\n\r\nWhenever you see a chance to help a fellow-man who is not as well\r\nequipped as you are, give him a lift up. If you do so, _you_ may forget\r\nit, but _he_ never will, and you will secure a friend who will be\r\nlooking for a chance to do you a good turn.\r\n\r\nAn old clergyman used to preach that true religion consisted in doing\r\nsomething good each day, so that when one went to bed at night, he could\r\nfeel that the world was a little better, or some one a little happier,\r\nbecause he had lived that day.\r\n\r\nChemistry is going to play the important part in the next twenty-five\r\nyears that electricity has in the past quarter of a century. Fortune\r\nawaits any man who can make use of waste material. Millions of dollars’\r\nworth of this is thrown away every year because the mind of man has not,\r\nas yet, been able to solve the problem of utilizing it. Students are now\r\nat work to this end and who can tell but one of you may be the man who\r\nwill play an important part in this great work of discovering new\r\nsources of wealth and progress. If so, he will find a bigger gold mine\r\nthan Wall Street.\r\n\r\nRailroad magnates are on the watch for improvements and devices of any\r\nkind that will tend toward saving time, increasing facilities, lessening\r\nliability of accident, or saving in cost of construction or equipment.\r\nHere is a broad field for action and for fertile minds to work in.\r\n\r\nCopper metal is in such demand that the price has recently been higher\r\nthan in a generation, namely, twenty-six cents a pound, and some cheaper\r\nmetal may be found to possess qualities that will allow it to take the\r\nplace of copper in a degree.\r\n\r\nSurgeons and physicians now perform operations and effect cures that\r\nwould have been considered miracles in my younger days, and still we\r\nfind each year that they have much to learn. It is possible that I am\r\nnow addressing some youthful savant, who will startle the world in the\r\ndistant future by still more miraculous skill.\r\n\r\nWherever you go, whatever you do, keep your eye on the star of Hope.\r\nEvery man has his place in the world if he can only find it. Opportunity\r\nknocks at every man’s door at some time during his early life. Look\r\nsharp and secure it when it knocks at yours, and grab it before it\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nBut, to all I would advise that when you have found occupation, whether\r\nit is in the professions, or not, strive to please. Don’t expect to sit\r\nin high places at once. Remember that most of you are in the junior\r\nclass and can only graduate to a higher class by merit. Study well your\r\nsurroundings and what is ahead of you. Carefully consider what may await\r\nyou. If you see no evidence of a position worthy of your hopes, do not\r\nhesitate to make a change. It is better to change several times while\r\nyou are young than to waste your time by remaining where you cannot\r\nexpect to achieve success.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental principles of business is that civility costs\r\nnothing and always pays good dividends, both in and out of Wall Street.\r\nVery often the temptation will come to you in dealing with a nervous or\r\ncranky customer or client, to give vent to your wrath or impatience. My\r\nadvice is don’t. That is also _Punch’s_ advice to those about to marry.\r\nTo succeed in holding and pleasing such a customer is a high\r\naccomplishment, and sure to attract attention.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty has endowed every man with two important allies, namely,\r\ncourage and conscience. The latter can be blunted if not heeded and an\r\nelastic conscience is worse than a wooden leg. Be cautious not to enter\r\ninto any deal or occupation when your conscience warns you that you are\r\ntreading on dangerous ground; but, having made up your mind that you are\r\nin the right, press forward with all the energy that is in you. If you\r\ndo not succeed, have the courage to rise and try again and renew the\r\nstruggle. Nearly every man who has made a great success in business life\r\nhas, in his earlier years, suffered reverses. These failures have been\r\nlessons that have taught him the way to win. You may often be\r\ntemporarily discouraged by seeing success come to the dishonest and\r\nunworthy, but remember that such cannot command the respect of their\r\nfellows. There is more in life than “filthy lucre,” although Wall Street\r\nprizes it immensely. A contented mind is more to be desired than great\r\nriches, and, if you are poor, be independently poor. Andrew Carnegie\r\nsays that to die rich is to die disgraced, so guard against that.\r\n\r\nYou are really now on the threshold of a new school—the school of Life.\r\nAs the old forest guides were taught their wood wisdom by the rocks, the\r\nstreams, the grass, the leaves, and kindred objects, so you will learn\r\nby actual contact with all the customs, rules, and complex situations of\r\nthe business world, what to do and what to avoid.\r\n\r\nMany young men are disheartened before they start in business by the\r\nfact that so many lines of manufacture are controlled by big\r\ncorporations and trusts. As I have already shown, they hear the talk of\r\nthe agitator and discontented that a poor man has no chance in life. Let\r\nme repeat that brains will always command a premium and that young men\r\nwho have brains, backed by energy, will always be in demand. You must\r\nprove that you have these requisites, by good work, and you will find\r\ncapital will seek to combine with such qualities. You may start in\r\nbusiness, or the professions, with your feet on the bottom rung of the\r\nladder; it rests with you to acquire the strength to climb to the top.\r\nYou can do so if you have the will and the force to back you. There is\r\nalways plenty of room at the top. The men now at the top have their\r\nminds and hands full, and are eager to delegate to smart assistants some\r\nof their work so as to ease the burden they bear. Success comes to the\r\nman who tries to compel success to yield to him. Cassius spoke well to\r\nBrutus when he said: “The fault is not in our stars, dear Brutus, that\r\nwe are underlings, but in our natures.”\r\n\r\nForm the habit as soon as you become a money earner, or money maker, of\r\nsaving a part of your salary, or profits. Put away one dollar out of\r\nevery ten you earn. The time will come in your lives, when, if you have\r\na little money, you can control circumstances; otherwise circumstances\r\nwill control you. You may often have to practice self-denial to save ten\r\nper cent. of your earnings; but compel yourselves to do so and you will\r\nnever regret it. Most of the leading men in business life to-day started\r\nout less well equipped with worldly goods or education than any of you.\r\nWhat they have done at least some of you can do.\r\n\r\nSee that the money you spend is well spent. By careful judgment in this\r\nrespect, you will acquire a habit which will cling to you in after life.\r\nMany a man makes bad investments because he did not learn to be cautious\r\nin the beginning of his business career.\r\n\r\nThe improvements in the past quarter of a century have been marvelous\r\nand the end is not yet. There are many new ideas being formulated, and\r\nsome of you may bear an important part in solving problems which will\r\nrevolutionize the world. Electricity and chemistry are perhaps still in\r\ntheir infancy, and latent forces are floating around unknown to men. The\r\nnext fifty years may indeed witness changes just as great and startling\r\nas we have seen during the last fifty.\r\n\r\nI once advised young men to go as soon as possible into business. I have\r\nchanged my opinion somewhat and think that it is well to get a technical\r\ntraining in a business at college where special courses are taught. I\r\nstill consider, however, that if a young man is to enter Wall Street he\r\nwill learn just as much by going into the Street as soon as he\r\ngraduates, and I consider a large office just as good as any business\r\ncollege, where a pupil can learn by actual experience as well as he\r\ncould by a theoretical course in a business college. Almost every man in\r\na leading position in a banking house has started as a junior clerk and\r\ngradually worked his way up.\r\n\r\nThe term “Get the habit” has become quite a metropolitan by-word and\r\nbrings me to speak on this subject, for the habits we acquire have much\r\nto do with our progress, and as Lamartine has truly said:\r\n\r\n                    “Habit with its iron sinews\r\n                     Clasps and holds us day by day.”\r\n\r\nIn the various matters of detail that make up the sum and substance of\r\nbusiness—considered as trifles by the foolish, but by the wise as\r\nimportant and vital—such as our methods of occupation, our time, and our\r\nmanners, great care should be taken to acquire the sterling habits of\r\nindustry, punctuality, and sobriety. The most watchful and jealous care\r\nshould ever be exercised by you all in this regard. A single deviation\r\nfrom the straight path may mean much, for habit is not of sudden\r\nacquirement, but is formed (and also lost) act by act, thread by thread,\r\nas we progress in the journey of life.\r\n\r\nIf you hold a fiduciary position in a Wall Street banking house, or\r\nbank, remember that the information you acquire regarding the secrets\r\nand inside facts of the business of your employers belongs to them alone\r\nand must not be divulged or spoken of to anyone. Very often you will\r\nhear of “tips” being circulated there as inside information. Never put\r\nfaith in such tips, as an employee who would give away the secrets of\r\nthe firm he works for would be unscrupulous enough to lie to you, and I\r\nwarn you not to make a close friend of such a person. Do not think that\r\nI look upon you as boys in tendering this piece of advice, but rather as\r\na veteran addressing new recruits.\r\n\r\nThe trait of tenacity of purpose is very often a natural gift; but if\r\nyou have not this persistence by nature you must cultivate it. For, with\r\nit, you can succeed, you can make difficulties bend, you can make\r\nopposition give way, and doubt and hesitancy yield to confidence and\r\nsuccess. Without it, the more shining qualities of our nature will not\r\ninsure your success, nor avert failure and disaster.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Suspension Bridge over the Niagara River was to be\r\nerected the great question was how to get the cable over. A kite was\r\nelevated, which, with a favoring wind, alighted on the opposite shore.\r\nTo its insignificant little string a cord was attached which was drawn\r\nover, then a rope, then a larger one, and then a cable; until the great\r\nbridge between the United States and Canada was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                First across the gulf we cast\r\n                Kite-borne threads till lines are passed,\r\n                And habit builds the bridge at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn like manner, my friends, our whole character is made up of little\r\nthings, of threads and strands and ropes of habit. Let us be sure that\r\nthey are always good and sound.\r\n\r\nNext to the unwisdom of selecting and following bad or incompetent\r\nadvisers in matters of business, there are also certain persons whom, if\r\nyou wish to do well and make a fortune honestly, you should be careful\r\nto avoid. You will not always know them by their appearance; in fact,\r\nthat is often the worst rule to go by, for they are generally well\r\ndisguised. It is in their manner and conversation that you will find\r\nthem out, and, that this be the easier, I have made a collection of\r\ntheir characteristics, as follows:\r\n\r\n        Avoid a man\r\n    Who vilifies his benefactor;\r\n    Who unjustly accuses others of bad deeds;\r\n    Who never has a good word for anybody;\r\n    Who, when he drinks, habitually drinks alone;\r\n    Who boasts of the superiority of his family;\r\n    Who talks religion downtown in connection with his daily business\r\n       affairs;\r\n    Who talks recklessly against the virtue of respectable women;\r\n    Who runs in debt with no apparent intention of paying;\r\n    Who borrows small sums on his note or check dated ahead;\r\n    Who will not work for an honest living;\r\n    Who looks down upon those who do;\r\n    Who is always prating about his own virtues;\r\n    Who imputes bad motives to those trying to do good;\r\n    Who betrays confidence;\r\n    Who lies;\r\n    Who is honest only for policy’s sake;\r\n    Who deceives his wife and boasts of it to others;\r\n    Who chews tobacco in a public conveyance;\r\n    Who gets intoxicated in public places;\r\n    Who partakes of hospitality and talks behind his entertainer’s back;\r\n    Who borrows money from a friend and then blackguards the lender.\r\n\r\nWith a population of 85,000,000 people, which this country now has, it\r\nis easy to find associates in life without selecting men possessed of\r\nany of these characteristics, and life is the better worth living\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nYou will both save and make money by strict observance of this short\r\ncatalogue of men to avoid. You are not called upon to do anything or to\r\nrisk any money in the exercise of this discretion. It simply consists in\r\nletting such people severely alone, and if you have been in the habit of\r\nbeing imposed upon by such characters, you will find your happiness, as\r\nwell as your cash, greatly increased by prudently avoiding them.\r\n\r\nThere is another subject of signal importance, to which I invite your\r\nearnest attention.\r\n\r\nYou must ever bear in mind that while, when you become citizens, you\r\nwill possess certain rights and privileges—such as the elective\r\nfranchise and equality before the law—there are, as well, sacred\r\nobligations and duties imposed upon you, as citizens, that should be\r\nfaithfully regarded and performed.\r\n\r\nTo properly understand and appreciate these duties, you should, I\r\nreiterate, make a careful study of our system of government, and\r\nacquaint yourselves with the manner in which municipalities, states, and\r\nthe nation are governed.\r\n\r\nAs you mature, attend political meetings and read and discuss economic\r\nquestions of the day; for public discussion is one of the best\r\nquickeners of individual thought and expression. Be prepared, when the\r\ntime comes, to actively participate in the affairs of your city and\r\nstate as well as the nation, and stand always ready and willing to lend\r\nyour aid to the uplifting of the government to the highest ideals of\r\nDemocracy, or Republicanism, as you see them.\r\n\r\nIf I should add a further word of advice it would be an appeal to you to\r\never cherish, deep in your hearts, undying love of country.\r\n\r\nNot only be ready to defend it with your lives; but constantly cultivate\r\nand encourage the inspiring qualities of civic pride and virtue, so that\r\nyour whole future career will reflect a sincere and patriotic affection\r\nfor and just appreciation of the noble institutions of our great\r\nrepublic. As, however, you are doubtless all true patriots this advice\r\nmay be uncalled for.\r\n\r\nLeaving, these few precepts with you, I wish to assure you that in\r\nwhatever you may undertake, in banking, trade, or the professions, you\r\nwill have my good wishes for your success, and if I have planted in your\r\nminds seed that will bear good fruit, it will add to the pleasure I have\r\nenjoyed in addressing you and giving you incidentally, as students of\r\nAmerican social conditions, my experience of human nature, for, in your\r\ncase particularly, the proper study of mankind is Man.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\n        THE FINANCIAL AND TRADE SITUATION AND\r\n                         PROSPECTS.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  An address delivered at the Annual Banquet of the National Association\r\n  of Cotton Manufacturers, at the Hotel Brunswick, Boston, on Thursday\r\n  evening, April 16, 1908, by Henry Clews, LL.D.\r\n\r\nIn familiarizing myself with the history, scope, and objects of the\r\ndistinguished organization I have the honor to address—The National\r\nAssociation of Cotton Manufacturers—I was impressed by the vast extent\r\nand importance of the interests it represents through its membership,\r\nwhich covers not only New England but the whole manufacturing world of\r\nthe United States, to say nothing of foreign countries in which it has a\r\nnotable representation.\r\n\r\nSuch an organization is obviously capable of exerting great and lasting\r\npower for good in the improvement and development of the cotton\r\nmanufacturing industry in this country, and incidentally it cannot fail\r\nto benefit all our manufacturing interests, for there are ties, visible\r\nand invisible, that bind them all together in a bond of mutual sympathy.\r\n\r\nHow immense these interests are is almost beyond computation; but we may\r\nform some idea of them from the fact that the capital stock of the\r\ntextile mills, print works and bleacheries represented by your\r\nAssociation’s own members alone, aggregates no less than $334,500,000,\r\nwithout counting their surplus.\r\n\r\nYour statistics further tell us that in these mills are 17,157,637\r\nspindles, 1,472 sets of woolen and worsted cards, 5,849 knitting\r\nmachines, and 67 printing machines. These figures are eloquently\r\nsuggestive of the country’s manufacturing enterprise and skill, which\r\nhave kept pace with its rapid growth, and the progress of mechanical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nBeyond all this, you have $400,075,000 more capital in the affiliated\r\nmanufacturing industries of cotton cloth, cotton, textile machinery,\r\nmill supplies and the like, represented by your associate members. This,\r\nindeed, is a grand exhibit.\r\n\r\nSo your association is the representative of $734,586,000 of capital, a\r\nlarge item in the national wealth of the United States. But, great as it\r\nis, it will continue to grow with this great and ever-growing nation,\r\nand with it will come still further improvements in mechanical\r\nprocesses, methods and machinery, and a far wider foreign market for our\r\nmanufactures, especially in the Orient and South America, where the\r\nBritish and the Germans have dominated trade in the past.\r\n\r\nThis association in its work for the advancement of cotton manufacturing\r\ninterests, and particularly in the promotion of their commercial\r\nrelations, and whatever relates to improvements in manufacture, is a\r\nvaluable ally of the motive power that turns the wheels and runs the\r\nmachinery of the mills; and I congratulate you on being united for a\r\npurpose so conducive to both the prosperity of a great manufacturing\r\ninterest and the national welfare.\r\n\r\nI will now turn to the main subject, the financial and trade situation,\r\npresent and prospective, in which I find much that is encouraging and\r\nfavorable to a general betterment of conditions from this time forward.\r\n\r\nWith regard to business conditions and prospects, the general sentiment\r\nof both Wall Street and the rest of the country is optimistic, and to\r\nthis may be attributed the extensive recovery of the stock market that\r\nhas already taken place since the crisis that began in October. Although\r\nthe dealings in stocks have been very largely professional, the\r\nimprovement reflects the confidence in the situation of the rich Wall\r\nStreet men who have led the movement, and confidence, like distrust, is\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any considerable buying by the outside public has been\r\nconspicuous, but so also, since the end of 1907, has been forced or\r\nvoluntary liquidation. Hence, there being no pressure to sell actual\r\nstock, it was easy for the powerful bull party at work to advance prices\r\nagainst the short interest, which was very large; and the bears were\r\ndriven to cover their contracts at a heavy sacrifice of their previous\r\npaper profits. But, like the poor, the bears are always with us, and\r\ntheir expressed views as to trade conditions and prospects are, of\r\ncourse, as pessimistic as those of the majority are the reverse. But the\r\nmajority rule, and Wall Street never fails to discount the future. It is\r\nthe great financial barometer of the United States.\r\n\r\nLeaving sentiment aside, there is ample scope for differences of opinion\r\nas to the exact situation and the future, so conflicting are the reports\r\nthat come to us. In some sections, and some industries, very different\r\nconditions are reported than those that prevail elsewhere, and bankers,\r\nmerchants and manufacturers in the same towns disagree as to things as\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nThis shows that we are in that uncertain transition period which always\r\nfollows panic; and how long it will last, is the problem that business\r\nmen all over the country are now trying to solve. Meanwhile the rise in\r\nstocks, which has been encouraged by the banking interest largely for\r\nthe sake of its influence in promoting confidence among the people of\r\nall classes, may fairly be looked upon as the precursor of substantial\r\nimprovement in general business.\r\n\r\nYet, however much we may hope for quick recovery from the effects of the\r\ncrisis, we should always look unfavorable facts squarely in the face,\r\nfor self-deception is the worst kind of folly. We must consider the\r\nworst, as well as the best, features of the situation, in order to gauge\r\nit correctly; and the reduction of ten per cent. in the wages of cotton\r\nmill operatives in New England, and the working of many cotton, woolen\r\nand other mills on part time only, and the shutting down of others,\r\nshows how much manufacturing industry there, as well as elsewhere, has\r\nbeen affected by the severe ordeal we have passed through.\r\n\r\nBut, so far as the banking institutions were concerned, Boston enjoyed a\r\nlarger degree of immunity from trouble during the crisis than any other\r\ncity, a fact that bears testimony to their soundness and conservatism.\r\nBoston may, therefore, well pride herself on this memorable\r\ncircumstance, the result of good banking and good business methods. She\r\nhad, fortunately, no speculative capitalists with chains of important\r\nbanks under their control, as New York had.\r\n\r\nThe crisis accomplished one good thing, and that was the sweeping away\r\nof this unsound banking, which had become a menace not only to New York,\r\nbut to the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe best banking authorities believe that actual business improvement is\r\nalready making headway, although there is no uniformity in it, the\r\nrecovery in some places, and some lines of business, being decided,\r\nwhile in others it is barely visible. Thus the Southwest, and its great\r\ndistributing center, St. Louis, report a larger degree of betterment\r\nthan any other section, while Chicago, like the Eastern and Middle\r\nStates, reports comparatively little.\r\n\r\nIn the present stage of recuperation, the wage problem is forcing itself\r\nmore and more upon public attention, and especially upon that of mill\r\nowners and the railway companies. The urgent necessity the railways are\r\nunder of reducing them, to offset reduced earnings, is met by the\r\nunwillingness, or refusal, of the men to have them reduced. They have\r\nbeen encouraged in this attitude by President Roosevelt’s action, and\r\nnow the labor leaders are urging Congress to legislate in support of\r\ntheir position. But Capital has its rights as well as Labor.\r\n\r\nThe railway companies, as an alternative to reducing wages, have\r\nproposed an increase in freight rates, but shippers are up in arms\r\nagainst this, particularly manufacturers; and the authorities of the\r\nStates, as well as the Interstate Commerce Commission, signified their\r\nopposition to it. The railways, meanwhile, have kept pace, as far as\r\npracticable, with the contraction of traffic, by discharging large\r\nnumbers of their men. In this way they have materially reduced their\r\nexpenses, while they report increased efficiency by the labor still\r\nemployed, every man in these times being anxious to hold his place by\r\ndoing good work.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, jobs being now scarce, men want to keep their jobs\r\ninstead of being “laid off,” as the phrase is. This of itself is a\r\nwholesome effect of hard times.\r\n\r\nThe labor problem is one of peculiar difficulty, and substantial,\r\npermanent improvement in trade and securities will not be seen until\r\nthere has been a complete readjustment of commodities, prices and wages\r\nin accordance with the altered conditions. To insure steady work for\r\nlabor, and a fair profit for employers, why would it not be wisdom for\r\nthe labor union leaders to agree to a contract to last for the coming\r\nfour months only, consenting to a reduction of 20 per cent. in wages?\r\n\r\nReadjustment is a harmonizing process, and harmony promotes recovery and\r\nthe full development of our powers and resources. This is what the\r\nbusiness situation imperatively calls for now, and all business men\r\nshould do their best to foster it, and so work together as a unit, for\r\nin unity there is strength. We have an example of it in our United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe cotton goods industry in New England has, I know, been much more\r\nseverely depressed by the crisis than was at first thought possible;\r\nbut, fortunately, the losses sustained will be the more easily borne\r\nbecause of the large profits of previous years. Notwithstanding the cuts\r\nmade in standard goods, the demand for them is still abnormally light,\r\nand hence stocks are accumulating in the face of the heavy decrease in\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, therefore, that those most intimately concerned are more or\r\nless at sea as to how long this depression will continue, and what the\r\nresults will be. They see certain grades of goods that were selling at\r\n8⅜ cents a yard just before the panic now being offered at 5½ cents, and\r\nthis is an object lesson that tends to make even the most optimistic of\r\nthem a trifle blue for the time being. But this is precisely the time\r\nwhen courage and confidence in the situation are most needed. I give you\r\nall credit, however, for being equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\nWith eighty-five millions of our own people to clothe—to say nothing of\r\nthe rest of mankind—manufactured cotton products will before long be in\r\ndemand again at rising prices, for civilization demands clothes in hot\r\nweather as well as cold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, endurance is called for, and will doubtless not be found\r\nwanting, except where special circumstances impose limits to it, and we\r\nall know that patience is a virtue.\r\n\r\nRecovery to normal conditions will, of course, be gradual, and it is\r\nbetter that it should be so, to ensure permanence. In the meantime, it\r\nwill be a relief to the dry goods trade when sales are no longer\r\nextensively made by cutting under quoted prices more or less sharply.\r\n\r\nThe bold, and even aggressive, action of the American Federation of\r\nLabor in going to Washington and making demands upon Congress, and\r\ncriticizing not only the laws but the decisions of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, puts a new and serious face on the old contest\r\nbetween Labor and Capital. It arouses some apprehension as to the\r\nlengths to which Labor will go, and how far its political influence may\r\nenable it to accomplish its purposes. Politicians are ever ready to show\r\nsubserviency to Labor, merely for the purpose of gaining votes for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe all want to see justice done to Labor, but we also want to guard\r\nagainst injustice being done to Capital by Labor, and Labor’s resistance\r\nto a reduction of wages to correspond in some degree with the decline in\r\nthe earnings and profits of those employing it, is a practical injustice\r\nto all those outside the ranks of organized labor.\r\n\r\nThe readjustment of wages to existing conditions is, therefore, of the\r\nfirst importance and should be first to receive serious consideration,\r\nwith a view to harmonizing both sides, and a prompt settlement. Half a\r\nloaf is better than no bread, for both Labor and Capital, and it is not\r\nto the interest of either to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\r\nTheir interests are mutual, but Labor is posing as if they were\r\nantagonistic. It has often done this before, but never more\r\nconspicuously than now.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our foreign market for cotton goods, there is plenty of\r\nroom to widen it, but our exports of these, in competition with England,\r\nGermany and other countries, are more or less checked by the high price\r\nof labor here, and its comparatively low price there. Hence we should\r\nconstantly endeavor to overcome this disadvantage by keeping ahead of\r\nthe rest of the world in labor-saving devices, and improvements in\r\nmachinery and manufactures. We should try to surpass all Europe in the\r\nquality, as well as the cheapness of our goods.\r\n\r\nAs we are the most inventive of all nations, and the quickest to adapt\r\nourselves to new or altered conditions, we shall doubtless find this\r\nfeasible, if not an easy task, whereas England, our greatest competitor\r\nin manufacturing, is proverbially slow in changing machinery.\r\n\r\nI once asked Mr. Andrew Carnegie what was the mainspring of his\r\nphenomenal success as a manufacturer of iron and steel, and he replied:\r\n\r\n“I always kept foremost in making improvements in my machinery and\r\nmethods of manufacture. Whenever a new invention that I could use was\r\npatented, I secured it at any cost, and so kept in advance of all my\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n“At one time I had two million dollars’ worth of new machinery that I\r\nwas about to install, but a man came to me with an improvement in it\r\nthat he had just patented, and I bought his patent and adopted it. In\r\ndoing this, I had to cast aside, as old material, the two millions’\r\nworth of new machinery. But the improvement recompensed me many times\r\nover for what I had sacrificed to make the change.”\r\n\r\nIt is in promoting improvements in manufacturing processes and machinery\r\nthat this Association, apart from its general utility, can be of great\r\nand permanent value to the cotton mill industry and kindred\r\nmanufacturing enterprises. Ready adaptability of means to ends is as\r\nimportant in manufacturing cotton sheetings, and the other products of\r\nthe loom, as in every other business and everything else.\r\n\r\nI remember that in conversation with Admiral Sir Charles Beresford, of\r\nthe British navy, when he was visiting New York, he told me of an\r\ninstance of American adaptability to circumstances, that he noticed\r\nwhile in China. The Chinese had been long complaining of the want of\r\nsufficient width in a certain grade of British cotton fabrics that they\r\nwere using and they had asked the English agents from time to time if\r\nthey would increase the width. But nothing came of their expostulations\r\nand requests, as the agents, after writing home, told them the\r\nManchester manufacturers said they would have to alter their machinery\r\nin order to give them the desired width, and this could not be done.\r\n\r\nBut the agent of a large American dry goods house, with extensive cotton\r\nmill interests, arrived at Shanghai, and hearing the complaint of the\r\nChinese, he said: “Give me your order and you can have whatever width\r\nyou want,” and he got the order. Sir Charles added: “So, you see, you\r\npeople are smart and give them what they want; besides, you make your\r\ncotton goods heavier than we do and the Chinese like them better because\r\nthey wear longer, for when the Chinese put on such clothes they never\r\ncome off until they rot off.” Here was an instance of ready adaptability\r\nto the occasion and market needs by an American, which the English\r\nlacked.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the importance of scientific investigation with a\r\nview to the discovery of new elements and processes in manufacturing, is\r\nfound in silkine, a fabric closely resembling silk, which has come into\r\npopular use. It resulted from the discovery that the mulberry and other\r\ntrees on which silk worms feed possess properties that could be\r\nextracted and utilized, to a certain extent, in the production of a\r\nsilky fibrous material which in combination with fine Egyptian cotton,\r\nmade a cloth so closely resembling silk as to be possibly mistaken,\r\nexcept by experts, for the silk of the silk worm. Here theoretical and\r\npractical science were happily combined with mechanical skill to produce\r\nan entirely new material, and doubtless there are many similar\r\nopportunities awaiting discovery. This Association by stimulating such\r\ninvestigation in mechanical science may achieve even greater results\r\nthan it anticipates.\r\n\r\nThe world’s markets offer a most magnificent opportunity for the\r\nenterprise of American cotton manufacturers. We grow four-sixths of the\r\nworld’s crop of cotton but manufacture only one-sixth. That is to say,\r\nwe export three-fourths of the cotton we grow, leaving England and\r\nGermany to turn the fibre into yarns and fabrics for other countries in\r\nall parts of the world. A much larger share of this foreign trade ought\r\nby right to come to the United States, for the foreign market offers a\r\nfield vastly larger and quite as profitable as the domestic field, if\r\nthe extraordinary profits of Lancashire spinners during the past few\r\nyears are to be taken as an index.\r\n\r\nLast year Great Britain exported cotton goods valued at $500,000,000,\r\nwhile our exports of cotton manufactures were valued at only\r\n$26,000,000. During this same period Great Britain exported\r\n6,298,000,000 yards of piece goods valued at $400,000,000; our exports\r\nmeanwhile being only 216,000,000 yards at $15,000,000. Here, then, is a\r\nfield for our best ambitions and skill. We cannot forever endure the\r\nsight of seeing other nations manipulating our raw product at enormous\r\nprofits, a goodly portion of which should remain for distribution on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThere is one respect in which the New England cotton industry much\r\nimpresses an outsider. Your industry, I am glad to say, is, and always\r\nhas been, remarkably free from the evils of promotion and speculative\r\nenterprise. Furthermore, it has most fortunately not been inoculated\r\nwith the fever for trusts and consolidations; although I happen to know\r\nthat such projects have from time to time been presented to your\r\nconsideration. Perhaps your refusals to entertain such propositions thus\r\nfar have been due to conditions peculiar to the industry; yet I venture\r\nto hope that it has been not a little due to the strong spirit of\r\nindividualism which is one of the best characteristics of the New\r\nEnglander; a characteristic which I trust will be cherished for\r\ngenerations to come, because it is a most wholesome and necessary check\r\nupon the paternalistic tendencies of the day. One beneficial result of\r\nthis policy is that the cotton industry is adapting itself to the new\r\nconditions following the panic with much less friction than in other\r\nindustries. You have lowered prices, curtailed production and diminished\r\ncosts in order to stimulate a revival of consumption in a manner that\r\npromises to make you among the first in completing the process of\r\nreadjustment. When recovery begins the cotton trade ought to be among\r\nthe first to feel reviving influences. While other industries have been\r\nusing or misusing their newly acquired powers of combination to resist\r\nnatural tendencies, or to squeeze out dividends upon grossly watered\r\nstocks, you have squarely faced the new conditions and trimmed your\r\nsails accordingly. I have no doubt, therefore, that, with your mills\r\nhonestly capitalized, you will soon be going along safely and\r\ncomfortably in smoother waters when the trusts will still be struggling\r\nagainst adverse conditions simply made worse by foolish resistance to\r\neconomic laws.\r\n\r\nThe most encouraging feature of our business situation now is the\r\nprospect of an unusually large wheat crop, winter wheat being in extra\r\nfine condition, and spring wheat having been planted under the most\r\nfavorable conditions, owing to the season for farm work being three\r\nweeks earlier this year than last. The planting of other crops has also\r\nbeen facilitated by good weather, and altogether the agricultural\r\noutlook, at this date, has very rarely been so promising of bountiful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThis is a great national blessing, for the foundation of our national\r\nwealth is our crops. Agriculture is indeed the great source of both our\r\nnational and international strength. It was almost entirely from this\r\nsource that we were enabled, from a merely nominal sum last August, to\r\nbuild up a foreign trade balance of 521 millions of dollars in the first\r\neight months of this fiscal year, and the large preponderance of our\r\nexports over our imports still continues, and will make the balance in\r\nour favor at the end of the year one of unexampled magnitude.\r\n\r\nThis curtailment of our imports, especially of luxuries, has made the\r\nshoe pinch in Europe, for we had been Europe’s best foreign customers.\r\nBut, naturally extravagant as we are as a people, we can economize with\r\nas much ease, celerity and determination as we can spend, when the\r\nnecessity to do so arises. So we are at present economizing on a grand\r\nscale and with great success.\r\n\r\nWe have only to consider our unlimited sources of national wealth,\r\nhowever, to see that the prospect before us is one that should inspire\r\nabsolute confidence in the gradual return of prosperity in all\r\ndirections. Let us bear in mind that our agricultural products yielded\r\nus last year, as the returns of the Department of Agriculture show,\r\n$7,400,000,000.\r\n\r\nMining and manufacturing were the next largest sources of our national\r\nwealth. The metals mined yielded $3,000,000,000, and this metal product\r\nwas converted by manufacturing into materials that had a market value of\r\nfifteen thousand millions of dollars. Thus the agricultural products,\r\nmetals mined and metals manufactured, in the year, had a value of\r\n$25,400,000,000. We may, therefore, well and honestly say that this is a\r\ngreat country. “Long life to it!” as an enthusiastic Irishman was once\r\nheard to exclaim. “By jabers, it can’t be beat!”\r\n\r\nThe market for raw cotton has, of course, been handicapped by the\r\ndepression in the cotton industry, and the efforts of the Southern\r\nplanters to advance the price of the staple very materially by holding\r\nit back instead of marketing it, have failed, as they deserved to fail.\r\nCotton is now lower than it was during the crisis, and about as low as\r\nat any time in this crop year, being 300 points, or 3 cents a pound,\r\nbelow the season’s top notch. But cotton is still king in the factories.\r\n\r\nThis decline is equivalent to $15 per bale, or a hundred and eighty\r\nmillion dollars on a crop of twelve million bales. So spinners and spot\r\nbuyers in general have not for two years had so good a chance to\r\npurchase for summer and autumn delivery, and advantageously cover their\r\nseason’s requirements as they had last month and this. But spinners have\r\ntaken more than a million bales less of this season’s crop since the\r\nfirst of September last than in the same time in the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau in its final report for the season tells us the total\r\ncrop ginned up to the first of March last was 11,261,163 bales,\r\nincluding “linters”; and it estimates that 127,646 bales remained\r\nunginned on March 1. Allowing for the usual under-estimating of the\r\ncotton ginned in the reports to the Government, it follows, from the\r\nfigures, that the spinnable cotton from the last season’s crop will\r\naggregate no more than 11,500,000 bales. This is with the average net\r\nweight of a bale, 501½ pounds.\r\n\r\nThe statistical or technical position of cotton is therefore bullish,\r\nnotwithstanding the very large falling off in consumption and the\r\nrequirements of spinners, this year, both here and in Europe, as the\r\nindications are that there will not be a very heavy or unmanageable load\r\nof cotton to be carried over into the new crop year, which begins on the\r\nfirst of September.\r\n\r\nOne very hopeful sign of the times is the check that has been given to\r\nradical state legislation concerning railway corporations by the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, declaring the rate laws of Minnesota and\r\nNorth Carolina in certain respects unconstitutional. The decision\r\npractically denies the right of a State to enact and enforce rate laws\r\nagainst interstate railways. This takes the wind out of the sails of a\r\ngood many Western and Southern political agitators, and makes the State\r\ncourts more definitely than ever subservient to the Federal Courts. The\r\nclash as to jurisdiction between the two courts which we witnessed in\r\nthe South last year is therefore not likely to recur.\r\n\r\nThe decision was based mainly upon the unreasonable penalties prescribed\r\nby the North Carolina and Minnesota statutes, but it sustains beyond all\r\nquestion the contention of the railway companies, which are now held to\r\nbe at liberty to refuse to obey any State law reducing rates upon their\r\nmaking affidavit that it would reduce their earnings to an unreasonable\r\nextent. Upon such an affidavit a judge of the United States Circuit\r\nCourt can order a suspension of the operation of the law until the law\r\ncan be shown in court to be reasonable.\r\n\r\nThis is a protecting bulwark against radical and confiscatory State\r\nlegislation, resulting from the inflammatory appeals of demagogues. By\r\nprotecting the railways it protects investors, and adds to the security\r\nof railway property, which, in turn, strengthens confidence in that\r\nproperty, and confidence is what is most necessary to recuperation. Let\r\nus therefore help to increase it.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire to promote confidence, and clarify the business\r\nsituation, that has inspired the recent utterances of President\r\nRoosevelt, and dictated the course of the Federal law department. This\r\nis commendable and has had a good effect.\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular event of the crisis, and its most sensational\r\nstarting point, in New York, was the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust\r\nCompany under a wild rush to withdraw its deposits on the 22nd of\r\nOctober, 1907, and the subsequent suicide of Charles T. Barney, its\r\npresident; and the most satisfactory event in its later career was its\r\nresumption of business on the 26th of March, 1908, after many trials and\r\ntribulations. On that day, too, it received $1,500,000 of deposits more\r\nthan it paid out, a remarkable contrast to the heavy run before the\r\nsuspension. This, and the almost simultaneous payment in full of the\r\ndepositors of the Oriental Bank, a New York State institution, were\r\nreassuring influences that did much in helping to pave the way to\r\ngeneral recovery, and stimulate the rise in the stock market, which of\r\nitself had a good moral, if not material, effect upon the business\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the fourth day after the Knickerbocker’s suspension,\r\nnamely, on Saturday, the 26th of October, that the New York Clearing\r\nHouse committee decided to issue Clearing House certificates to the\r\nbanks in the Association needing them to pay their Clearing House\r\nbalances. Then their issue against satisfactory collaterals deposited\r\nwith the Clearing House, began at once. This was the signal for every\r\nother clearing house in the country to do likewise simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the detailed weekly bank statements were suspended, and\r\nthese were not resumed till the 8th of February, 1908. Meanwhile a\r\nhundred and one millions of the Clearing House certificates had been\r\nissued and redeemed, except some that were held by the National Bank of\r\nNorth America, the Mechanics and Traders Bank, the Bank of New\r\nAmsterdam, and the Oriental Bank, which had all failed. But these were\r\nall redeemed before the end of March.\r\n\r\nIt was in the third week of November that the issue of Clearing House\r\ncertificates reached its maximum. But the banks had reached their\r\nlargest deficit in reserve in the first week of November, when it rose\r\nto $54,100,000, a prodigious amount of which the public was in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nIn Boston at the same time your banks had taken out $11,995,000 of their\r\nown Clearing House certificates, but this total was never increased.\r\nAfter that the banking situation all over the country was slowly on the\r\nmend. But, owing to the partial suspension of currency payments by the\r\nbanks, caused by runs and hoarding inspired by the use of clearing house\r\ncertificates, currency and gold commanded a premium in New York ranging\r\nfrom 1 to 5 per cent. This premium was current from the time the\r\ncertificates were first issued till the end of December, 1907. The\r\nhoarding of money was, meanwhile, enormous. After that the premium\r\nbecame suddenly a thing of the past, and hoarded money was rapidly\r\ndeposited with the banks.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in the panic of 1873 the New York Clearing House\r\nissued only $26,565,000 of certificates, and in the panic of 1893 only\r\n$41,690,000. But these figures merely show how very much smaller New\r\nYork’s banking capital, deposits, and loans were in those years than\r\nthey are now.\r\n\r\nThe throwing out of employment through the effects of the panic of large\r\nnumbers of men, most of them of foreign birth, resulted in a larger\r\nexodus of steerage passengers to Europe than was ever before known,\r\nthese aggregating 114,078 in the first two months of 1908, while only\r\n50,601 immigrants arrived here during those months. The outward rush\r\ncommenced in November and it still continues with little abatement. But\r\nas a safety valve for unemployed labor it is perhaps to be welcomed for\r\nthe time being, as it reduces the ranks of the unemployed, and when the\r\nlabor of these aliens is again in demand they will return as fast as\r\nthey went. They know on which side their bread is buttered.\r\n\r\nImmigration is, however, no longer as necessary to this country as it\r\nwas in pioneer times. Our aim now should be to keep out undesirable\r\nimmigrants, particularly anarchists, Black Hand Italians and Armenians,\r\nand rabid socialists who come here to make trouble, and preach doctrines\r\nof equality and confiscation, entirely inimical to American institutions\r\nand national as well as individual progress.\r\n\r\nI now come to the markets for stocks, bonds, and speculative\r\ncommodities, and the recent indiscriminate attacks upon them by Mr.\r\nBryan and others both in and out of Congress, as hotbeds of what they\r\ncall gambling.\r\n\r\nAs one of the oldest members of the New York Stock Exchange I can, from\r\nmy long experience, testify to the integrity and high character of its\r\nmembership, and the strict discipline of that Association over those\r\ncomposing it. Any breach of its rules, any deviation from the line of\r\nfair dealing, or anything prejudicial to its interests, is promptly\r\ninvestigated and as promptly punished, when proved to the satisfaction\r\nof the Governing Committee, by fine, suspension, or expulsion. But it is\r\nvery rare for a member to be either charged with or found guilty of\r\nchicanery of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unjust and outrageous for Mr. Bryan and others who have\r\ndenounced the New York Stock Exchange to call it a gambling arena and\r\nits members gamblers. They are brokers in a free market, a market open\r\nto all the world, and they are ready to receive and execute orders from\r\nall the world, and whether or not these orders are for investment or\r\nspeculative account, it is not for them to inquire. Still less is it for\r\nthem to discriminate against speculation, when speculative far more than\r\ninvestment dealings are the life of every stock exchange in the world. A\r\nstock exchange to have any value must be a free market.\r\n\r\nSpeculation in stocks is no more gambling than speculation in real\r\nestate, or merchandise, although different in degree, but there may be\r\nexcesses in speculation as in everything else. The stock exchange as a\r\nbody should not, however, be held responsible for the excesses of\r\nindividual speculators, or for the dishonesty of men who embezzle in\r\norder to get money for the purpose of speculating. Gas should not be\r\nblamed for causing the death of a man who deliberately locks his room\r\ndoor, shuts his windows tight, and turns on the gas to die.\r\n\r\nThose who know Wall Street well, as I do, know how false a view of it\r\nMr. Bryan and others, including certain members of Congress, have given\r\nto the public. If they really had known Wall Street well, and had any\r\nconscience, they would not have said what they did say. They have\r\nmisrepresented it grossly and unjustifiably, and in their moralizings\r\nupon it they have not reasoned, but ranted.\r\n\r\nSome of them have even advocated the entire elimination of the Stock\r\nExchange. They would thus invite financial chaos and leave investors,\r\nthe banks, insurance companies, and all other corporate holders of\r\nstocks and bonds practically without a market for their securities in\r\nwhich to either buy or sell. This would be putting back the hands of the\r\nclock of progress with a vengeance. It would be going back to the wigwam\r\nand the canal boat, but of course it would never be tolerated and\r\ntherefore be impossible.\r\n\r\nYet this slandering and mudslinging campaign by representatives of both\r\nthe great political parties for political effect is none the less\r\ninjurious and reprehensible because it can never have any substantial\r\nresult, much less the destruction of Wall Street. It is scandalous abuse\r\nof which we may have more before the November election, but it is\r\nalready high time that it should stop in the interest of truth and\r\njustice and the public welfare.\r\n\r\nThese assailants of the New York Stock Exchange would also abolish all\r\nother stock exchanges, and the Chicago Board of Trade, as well as all\r\nthe other grain and provision exchanges, and all the cotton exchanges in\r\nthe country that deal in futures. Perhaps they are not aware that the\r\nfarmers and planters of the West and South derive, or can derive, great\r\nbenefit from having a free market for “futures” open to them, for it\r\nenables them to sell their crops before they are harvested, if the\r\nprices are satisfactory and they want to make sure of them. This applies\r\nalso to the Coffee Exchange and importers of coffee.\r\n\r\nTo drive dealings in time options from the Produce and other exchanges\r\nwould be to drive them to Canada, Liverpool, and London, and let the\r\nmarkets there make prices for us, instead of making them for ourselves,\r\nall of which shows the absurdity of this clamor against speculation in\r\nstocks and speculative commodities. Speculation is thus stigmatized as\r\ngambling with no more reason or justice than the inevitable risks of\r\nordinary mercantile trade could be called gambling, for no one can\r\nengage in trade of any kind without taking risks.\r\n\r\nNow that the storm of the crisis has passed away, and the investigation\r\nand prosecutions that have taken place have laid bare the corporate\r\nevils that were rife among us, including railway rate rebating and\r\nvarious forms of looting and wholesale graft by controlling capitalists,\r\nwe have come into a purer business atmosphere. Corrupt, plundering, and\r\nlaw-breaking officers of banks, and railway, insurance, and other large\r\ncorporations have, in many cases, been exposed and shown the error of\r\ntheir ways, and we have in consequence a higher business morality than\r\nwe had before we passed through this ordeal of purification. In other\r\nwords, the house cleaning we have had has done us good, and this of\r\nitself is a compensation that can hardly be overrated in its future\r\ninfluence. Banks and trust companies and railways, insurance, and other\r\ncorporations have been freed from much unsound and dishonest management,\r\nand also loose, grafting and speculative practices, and we have in their\r\nplace that higher moral tone which is safeguarded by greater publicity\r\nof accounts and more rigid official examinations under new and stricter\r\nlaws than ever before.\r\n\r\nThus temptation to chicanery and other corporate wrongdoing, and abuses,\r\nby those in control of corporations, is largely reduced, and this is\r\nimportant, for an old proverb tells us that opportunity makes the thief.\r\n\r\nGood grounds for an optimistic view of the situation and the future, you\r\nwill all acknowledge, can be found in our unequaled and immense natural\r\nresources and their uninterrupted development. These and the enterprise\r\nof our people and our free institutions and popular government, which\r\nmakes us all sovereigns in our own right, are national blessings. They\r\nfortify our national life, and leave our splendid growth and powers of\r\nachievement unchecked; and our wonderful progress in the past will no\r\ndoubt be eclipsed by our still greater and grander future, with the\r\nUnited States of America the foremost nation in the world.\r\n\r\nIn all this progressive movement the cotton and other mill industries of\r\nNew England, and the rest of the country, will share; and in this\r\nnatural and legitimate expansion, gentlemen, you and your successors may\r\nlook forward to, and find, the potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams\r\nof avarice, as Andrew Carnegie did in Pittsburg. From such a great\r\nAmerican object lesson for manufacturers as Carnegie, you should all\r\nderive a vast amount of encouragement, and that hope that springs\r\neternal in the human breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\n         PEACE ASSURANCES FROM JAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          ASSURANCE FROM VISCOUNT KENTARO KANEKO, THE EMINENT\r\n                  STATESMAN OF JAPAN, THAT BELLIGERENT\r\n                        REPORTS ARE GROUNDLESS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n           FABRICATIONS, HE SAYS, OF SENSATIONAL NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   NO APPREHENSION IN EMPIRE OF ANY DISRUPTION OF FRIENDSHIP EXISTING\r\n                        BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeclaring that all talk of trouble between this country and Japan is the\r\noutgrowth of “pernicious fabrication on the part of sensational\r\nnewspapers,” Viscount Kentaro Kaneko, who was special Ambassador to the\r\nUnited States from Japan during the Russian-Japanese war, has written a\r\nreply to a letter addressed him by me, in which the latter, under date\r\nof December 5th, last, expressed the hope that no difficulties might\r\narise between the two countries which could not be readily and amicably\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nViscount Kaneko, whose elevation to his present title and whose\r\nappointment as adviser to the Emperor on all things American, came close\r\nupon the heels of the close of the struggle with Russia, besides is one\r\nof the present eminent Statesmen of the Empire. During General Grant’s\r\nfirst term, he was a member of a commission sent here to study American\r\nfinance. Prince Ito was the head of this commission and I acted as\r\nfriendly adviser, at the request of General Grant, then President. This\r\ncommission afterwards went to London, Paris, and Berlin, and made a\r\nsimilar investigation of the financial systems of each of those nations,\r\nand on their return home, via the Suez Canal, they made a full report of\r\ntheir mission and in it strongly recommended their government to adopt\r\nthe American system, which was promptly done, and I was appointed by the\r\nJapanese Government special agent to aid in carrying out their new\r\nfinancial system. I awarded the contract for the engraving to the\r\nContinental Bank Note Co., of New York, on their successful competitive\r\nbid, and after all the work of establishing their new financial system\r\nwas accomplished I received a flattering commendation from the Secretary\r\nof the Japanese Treasury for my services in the matter and a very\r\nhandsome pair of Japanese silver vases as a souvenir accompanied same.\r\n\r\nMy letter, which was sent when reports of impending trouble with Japan\r\nwere numerous, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                   December 5, 1907.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR VISCOUNT:\r\n\r\n    It gives me infinite pleasure to congratulate you on the\r\n    bestowal of your present very great title by the Emperor,\r\n    knowing as I do that it is so richly deserved. No one in this\r\n    country can bear stronger testimony of your untiring vigilance\r\n    and masterly efforts in the work you had on hand in this country\r\n    during your war with Russia, and the marvelous success which\r\n    crowned your exertions. No one of your nation who has visited\r\n    this country made more or stronger friends than you did amongst\r\n    our people, and we are all hoping that the time will come when\r\n    you will return as Ambassador. It would indeed be an appointment\r\n    for the benefit of both nations, and would do more than anything\r\n    I can think of to strengthen the long-existing friendly\r\n    relations between the two peoples. There are occasional rumors\r\n    of our relations being strained, but they originate, I am quite\r\n    sure, in either Russia or Germany, owing to a desire in some\r\n    quarters to disrupt the friendship. You can rely upon one fact,\r\n    however, that if there is ever a severance, which God forbid, it\r\n    will not emanate from this side.\r\n\r\n                                  Faithfully yours, HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n                       VISCOUNT KANEKO’S ANSWER.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. CLEWS:\r\n\r\n    Your kind letter of December 5th reached me a few days ago and I\r\n    am infinitely obliged to you for your hearty congratulation on\r\n    my recent advancement to a higher rank for a modest service\r\n    which I was able to render my Emperor and country during the\r\n    late war. In performing the duties which were entrusted to me\r\n    during my sojourn in your country, what little I was able to\r\n    accomplish was due to the kind encouragement and assistance\r\n    which the friends in America so unsparingly gave me. and in this\r\n    connection I assure you that you share the largest part of it.\r\n\r\n    You mentioned about the so-called strained relations between\r\n    America and Japan. It is really a pernicious fabrication of\r\n    sensational newspapers, and I am glad that you seem to believe\r\n    it to be so too. So far as I am aware there is nothing of a\r\n    serious nature diplomatically pending between the two countries.\r\n    It is absolutely groundless, therefore, even to imagine, as some\r\n    alarmists would have us believe, that there may be a possible\r\n    disruption of the friendship which has been cemented so firmly\r\n    ever since this country was introduced by America to the family\r\n    of civilized nations in the world. I assure you that every one\r\n    of our people on this side of the Pacific is keenly alive to the\r\n    gratitude we owe you, and I think it most remarkable that nobody\r\n    in this empire seems to entertain, even to the slightest degree,\r\n    any apprehension of a breach of the friendship. Such a thing\r\n    never comes into our head. Again thanking you for your courtesy,\r\n\r\n                                  Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                       (Signed) KENTARO KANEKO.\r\n\r\n    TOKYO, JAPAN, January 21, 1908.\r\n\r\nI have kept up a correspondence with Prince Ito and other Japanese\r\nStatesmen ever since I was first associated with them thirty-seven years\r\nago. The letter from the Viscount spoke for itself and showed the utter\r\nnonsense of sensational reports.\r\n\r\nI also wrote to Marquis Ito about the war rumors as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                   December 5, 1907.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARQUIS:\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding the frequent rumors that have of late sprung up,\r\n    both in this country and Europe, to the effect that the\r\n    long-existing friendly relations between Japan and America are\r\n    becoming strained, I think I am in a position to know that there\r\n    is not the slightest foundation therefor, so far as we are\r\n    concerned. There has been, however, a vicious motive in their\r\n    circulation, and it is quite dear to my mind that they have had\r\n    their origin in, and are disseminated by people in Russia and\r\n    Germany, the wish being father to the thought. For some reason\r\n    or other they seem particularly anxious that the pleasant\r\n    relations existing between our two countries should be weakened,\r\n    and finally severed, hence the strenuous efforts in that\r\n    direction. I feel quite sure, however, that there is not the\r\n    slightest possibility of such a contingency.\r\n\r\n    To show how false these rumors are, as well as to cement the\r\n    friendship which now exists between our countries (which you and\r\n    I know to be real and lasting) and to put an end to the jingo\r\n    talk of the press both here and in Japan, would it not be an\r\n    excellent idea for the Emperor to formally invite the Admiral\r\n    and Commanders of our fleet, which is to cruise in the Pacific\r\n    waters, to meet him at some convenient seaport in your country?\r\n    I know that the American people would appreciate such an honor\r\n    and that the greeting they would receive from your countrymen\r\n    would banish all thought of a disruption of our pleasant\r\n    relations. The Yankees of the West respect and admire the\r\n    Yankees of the East, and every effort should be made to increase\r\n    the harmony which now prevails.\r\n\r\n    Hoping, my dear Prince, that you are enjoying good health and\r\n    happiness, I remain\r\n\r\n                                  Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                        HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n    MARQUIS ITO, TOKYO, JAPAN.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                         FLEET TO VISIT JAPAN.\r\n\r\n                          INVITATION ACCEPTED.\r\n\r\n            NEW PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.\r\n\r\n_Official Statement from Washington, March 20._\r\n\r\nThe American battleship fleet is to visit Japan. The desire of the\r\nEmperor to play host to the “Big Sixteen” was expressed to Secretary\r\nRoot yesterday by Baron Takahira, the Japanese Ambassador. The\r\ninvitation, which was in the most cordial terms, was considered by\r\nPresident Roosevelt and the Cabinet to-day. Secretary Root was directed\r\nto accept the invitation, and the acceptance was communicated to Baron\r\nTakahira this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n             THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n           DECORATES HENRY CLEWS WITH THE ORDER OF COMMANDEUR\r\n                   OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ORDER OF\r\n               THE RISING SUN—ON THE INSIGNIA IN JAPANESE\r\n                   LETTERS IS “KUN-KO-SEI-SHO”—WHICH\r\n                     MEANS “EXALTED MARK OF MERITS\r\n                             AND SERVICES.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      LETTER FROM VISCOUNT KANEKO.\r\n\r\n    _New York Tribune_, March 21, 1908.\r\n\r\n                                              TOKYO, March 23, 1908.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. CLEWS:\r\n\r\n    Please accept my heartiest congratulation on the new honor which\r\n    has been added to your already distinguished life by His\r\n    Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, who was pleased to confer upon\r\n    you the Imperial Decoration, in recognition of your valuable\r\n    service to this country. In due time, I know, Ambassador\r\n    Takahira in Washington will officially present it to you. I\r\n    hardly need say how gratefully I am appreciating your kind\r\n    friendship which enabled me to perform whatever was entrusted to\r\n    me, though to a very modest extent, during my sojourn in your\r\n    land in 1904-1905. And in this connection, I assure you that I\r\n    now look back, with much feeling, to those pleasant times I had\r\n    with you in America. I sincerely hope that our next meeting will\r\n    soon be in this country where your special interest in us is\r\n    already so greatly appreciated, as is shown in the recognition\r\n    which has been given you by the Emperor this time.\r\n\r\n    With my renewed assurance of the warmest regards to yourself,\r\n    and hoping that this will find you well, I remain,\r\n\r\n                                  Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                       (Signed) KENTARO KANEKO.\r\n\r\n    MR.

Upon its receipt\r\n    I will formally express my gratification to his Imperial\r\n    Majesty, the Emperor, for the great honor conferred.\r\n\r\n    If Japan were nearer to New York I might be able to promise that\r\n    our next meeting would be in your own country—the Land of the\r\n    Rising Sun—but as you have achieved so much good for Japan, in\r\n    the United States, I doubt not that business, or international\r\n    diplomacy, of which you are one of the masters, will bring you\r\n    here again, when, I assure you, you will be received with the\r\n    honor and respect which your distinguished services and your\r\n    high personal character entitle you to expect.\r\n\r\n    With assurances of the highest regard and friendship for you and\r\n    your countrymen, I have the honor to remain,\r\n\r\n                                  Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                       HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n    VISCOUNT KENTARO KANEKO,\r\n\r\n                                  TOKYO, JAPAN.\r\n\r\n                      CONSULATE GENERAL OF JAPAN.\r\n\r\n                                      60 WALL STREET, NEW YORK CITY,\r\n                                                     April 27, 1908.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED SIR:\r\n\r\n    Referring to the official dispatch of even date, I take liberty\r\n    to ask you to appoint some afternoon in the near future which\r\n    will be convenient for you to receive me at your home or\r\n    elsewhere when I will have the honor and pleasure of carrying\r\n    out the important mission of presenting you with the\r\n    distinguished mark of honor. With kind regards,\r\n\r\n                                  Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                       (Signed) K. MIDZUNO.\r\n\r\n    MR. HENRY CLEWS,\r\n\r\n         630 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\nI named Sunday, May 3d, at half-past one o’clock, at my residence, 630\r\nFifth Avenue, and invited a large number of friends to luncheon, which\r\nmade the occasion a most enthusiastic and enjoyable one.\r\n\r\n    The Honorable Kokichi Midzuno, said: Mr. Clews, acting under the\r\n    instructions of His Excellency Count Tadasu Hayashi, Minister of\r\n    Foreign Affairs, I have the honor to inform you that His\r\n    Imperial Majesty, the Tenno of Japan, my August Sovereign, as a\r\n    special token of Imperial good will, has graciously been pleased\r\n    to confer upon you the decoration of Commandeur of the most\r\n    distinguished order of the Rising Sun, and I have the honor to\r\n    present to you the said decoration. In performing this most\r\n    pleasant duty, I deem it my privilege to avail myself of this\r\n    occasion to tender my hearty congratulations and to convey to\r\n    you, Esteemed Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\nWhich was replied to by me as follows:\r\n\r\n    MR. MIDZUNO:\r\n\r\n    In receiving at your hands under the instructions of His\r\n    Excellency Count Tadasu Hayashi, Minister of Foreign Affairs for\r\n    the Empire of Japan, the decoration of Commandeur of the most\r\n    distinguished order of the Rising Sun, bestowed upon me by His\r\n    Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, as a special token of\r\n    his good will, I respectfully acknowledge my high appreciation\r\n    of the honor, and shall always value the distinction as one of\r\n    the greatest that could be conferred upon me. I shall ever\r\n    regard it not alone as a flattering compliment to myself, and a\r\n    recognition of such services as I have been able to render, but\r\n    as an emblem of the friendly relations that bind Japan and the\r\n    United States together in a bond of sympathy; and I trust that\r\n    this tie of friendship will never be weakened. I at least will\r\n    always endeavor to strengthen it.\r\n\r\n    I have long been intimately conversant with the affairs of\r\n    Japan, and been deeply and sympathetically interested in the\r\n    rapid and wonderful development of the Empire, and all the more\r\n    so in consequence of my good fortune in having had the personal\r\n    acquaintance, while they were in New York, of those two\r\n    distinguished Japanese Statesmen, who are now Prince Ito and\r\n    Viscount Kentaro Kaneko. Moreover, the correspondence that has\r\n    passed between us since their return to Japan has only quickened\r\n    my regard, and heightened my admiration for them and their\r\n    Country. Both have proved themselves great in peace as well as\r\n    war, and may the light of the Land of the Rising Sun never grow\r\n    dim, and America and Japan be joined by their mutual interests\r\n    in unbroken peace and concord forever.\r\n\r\n    With many thanks to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, for this\r\n    great honor, and to His Excellency Count Tadasu Hayashi, as well\r\n    as yourself, for your courtesy in the fulfilment of your duties,\r\n    and for the evidences of your personal friendship for me, which\r\n    touches me deeply, I assure you that my appreciation cannot be\r\n    expressed in words.\r\n\r\n    This symbol of the Rising Sun indicates the coming of the day of\r\n    greatness of your nation, and my fervent hope is that darkness\r\n    may be unknown in your land.\r\n\r\n    In the midst of our festivities to-day there is a cloud, and I\r\n    desire to express my deepest sympathy to the people of Japan in\r\n    the loss of so many young lives in the disaster which visited\r\n    them during the past week. Though dead, these young men still\r\n    live as an example to others that a life given to country in\r\n    time of peace deserves the same lasting glory as though given in\r\n    battle.\r\n\r\nI then requested the ladies and gentlemen to fill their glasses and rise\r\nand drink to the health of His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Consul General of Japan answered the toast as follows:\r\n\r\n    MR. CLEWS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n    As the local representative of Japan, I have the pleasure and\r\n    honor to thank you for the toast to His Imperial Majesty,\r\n    proposed by our esteemed Host and so heartily joined in by you\r\n    all. It is high honor as well as great pleasure that I was in a\r\n    position to personally present that high mark of honor to Mr.\r\n    Henry Clews. But what makes me most happy is that this came in\r\n    most opportune time, when the international horizon which was\r\n    said to be more or less clouded for some time has become\r\n    clear—so clear that even the yellowest journals of this country\r\n    which are sparing no efforts to stir up anti-Japanese feeling\r\n    among American people, can no more find any meteorological item\r\n    for a pessimistic weather forecast. Now that all transient and\r\n    incidental questions between your country and ours have been\r\n    settled in an amicable way, now that your government, on behalf\r\n    of your people, have gladly accepted our invitation to\r\n    participate in the Grand Exposition to be held in Japan in 1912,\r\n    and now that my fellow countrymen in Japan have most pleasant\r\n    anticipation to welcome the officers and men of your mighty\r\n    fleet of battleships in our beautiful ports, I hope and trust\r\n    that the most friendly relations between two nations, which have\r\n    existed and are happily existing, will be an everlasting one.\r\n\r\n    In conferring upon you, Mr. Clews, that high mark of honor which\r\n    I have just had the pleasure to present, His Majesty is\r\n    reflecting the friendly feeling and unfeigned affection that\r\n    fifty millions of His faithful subjects entertain toward the\r\n    people of this great Republic for their kind guidance and\r\n    unshaken sympathy shown to Japan and her people from the time\r\n    when your great Commodore knocked at the door of our Island\r\n    Empire to invite its secluded people to the comity of nations\r\n    down to the present day, not to speak of the most trying time\r\n    Japan passed through a few years ago, and their gratitude for\r\n    the most valuable service rendered by American people to effect\r\n    the termination of hostilities and restoration of peace through\r\n    the far-sighted, active, and able good offices of your great\r\n    President, whose toast I beg to propose.\r\n\r\nMy acknowledgment by letter of the honor conferred upon me:\r\n\r\n                                                        May 2, 1908.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    Please convey to his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, my\r\n    sincere thanks for bestowing upon me, as a token of his good\r\n    will, the Imperial decoration of Commandeur of the most\r\n    distinguished order of the Rising Sun. No words of mine can\r\n    fitly express my high appreciation of this honor, and I shall\r\n    always value the distinction as one of the greatest that it has\r\n    been my good fortune to achieve. I consider it a symbol of the\r\n    friendly relations existing between Japan and the United\r\n    States—a friendship which, I assure you, I shall endeavor to\r\n    foster and promote to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n    With many thanks to his Imperial Majesty for the honor conferred\r\n    upon me, of which I am justly proud, and to your Excellency for\r\n    your kind offices in my behalf, I have the honor to remain,\r\n\r\n                                  Most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                       (Signed) HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n    HIS EXCELLENCY COUNT TADASU HAYASHI, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n    OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Prince, then Marquis, Ito is interesting as a\r\npart of the world’s history, and shows the feeling and friendship of\r\nthat great statesman:\r\n\r\n                                              TOKYO, April 14, 1904.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    In answer to your letter of February 17th, let me first of all\r\n    thank you most sincerely for the constant sympathy you have\r\n    shown to our country’s cause. Your friendly efforts on the\r\n    occasion of the Chino-Japanese war are still fresh in my memory\r\n    and in the memory of all those who have heard of them. And, in\r\n    general, the sympathetic attitude of public opinion of your\r\n    country is a great encouragement to us in our faith that in\r\n    fighting for our own future security and undisturbed enjoyment\r\n    of the fruits of civilization, we are to a certain extent\r\n    fighting also for the common cause of all. Just as you say, the\r\n    supremacy of Russia in Corea would mean not only a constant\r\n    menace to the very existence of our island empire, but would\r\n    also mean the wholesale destruction of our commercial and\r\n    industrial interests already legitimately vested there in the\r\n    past, not to mention the loss of natural outlet for our\r\n    expanding people. The constant policy of Russia in this part of\r\n    the globe has steadily inclined toward monopolization of natural\r\n    resources of the country she conquers and annexes. Her\r\n    Manchurian policy is the irrefutable evidence of the above\r\n    statement. So that in fighting for our own interests we are at\r\n    the same time fighting for the principle of “fair competition\r\n    all around” in these new markets of the world. I am indeed very\r\n    sorry that the negotiations carried on on our side, with sincere\r\n    “bona-fide,” were not crowned with success so earnestly desired.\r\n    If the Russian Government were a little more inspired by the\r\n    spirit of moderation and of toleration for the legitimate\r\n    interests of others things would not have come to this pass. As\r\n    it was, there remained no other way for us but to try to enforce\r\n    by arms what we could not do by reason. And we had to do so ere\r\n    it would have become too late, for Russia was steadily and\r\n    rapidly augmenting her fighting forces available in this part of\r\n    her empire, so that before long the sheer mass of her fighting\r\n    power would have made it a folly for us to attempt to resist the\r\n    unscrupulous march onward. It has been nothing but a coolly\r\n    thought-out step in the cause of State necessity. And I am much\r\n    gratified to see that you as well as the general public opinion\r\n    of your country, have understood our motives in their true\r\n    light.\r\n\r\n    Hoping that you are enjoying as robust a health as when I saw\r\n    you last in New York, and also hoping to be able to see you\r\n    again in no distant future,\r\n\r\n                                  I remain, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                       (Signed) MARQUIS H. ITO.\r\n\r\n    HENRY CLEWS, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n        New York City, U. S. A.\r\n\r\nThe following article, which I wrote at the time for one of our leading\r\nmagazines, contains matter which may be instructive to my readers:\r\n\r\n                                                       May 24, 1904.\r\n\r\n    The success of the Japanese in the present war with Russia is\r\n    due to their great zeal. What they undertake to do, they\r\n    generally do with great earnestness of purpose, which calls\r\n    forth sacrifice, energy, courage, and determination. The\r\n    concentration of all these qualities is the basis of success in\r\n    all undertakings whether large or small. The success of the\r\n    Japanese is easily accounted for also by the fact that they love\r\n    their Emperor as a people—they are willing to fight for him and\r\n    to die for him, added to which, they are fatalists and are not\r\n    afraid to face death on the battle-field, because they firmly\r\n    believe that the next world is better than this, and therefore\r\n    to die in a good cause, especially in fighting for the salvation\r\n    of their country, secures a high and honorable position there.\r\n    Against these characteristics, which back the Japanese in the\r\n    present war, their antagonists, the Russians, fear their\r\n    Emperor, and under the autocratic rule of the nation soldiers\r\n    are very often put into the army through force and kept there.\r\n    There is a vast difference, therefore, on the battlefield, in\r\n    the fighting qualities of soldiers who are backed by love of\r\n    their Emperor and soldiers who are backed by fear of their\r\n    Emperor. Then again, the discipline of the Japanese soldiers is\r\n    of a more intelligent and up-to-date order than that of the\r\n    Russians. Each regiment in Japan is composed of 400 men with a\r\n    captain in command who carries a sword. Their training provides\r\n    that if anything should happen to the captain, and his sword\r\n    should fall to the ground, it must be taken up on the instant by\r\n    the next in rank, and if anything should happen to him, the next\r\n    in rotation takes his place, and so on all the way through to\r\n    the last man; and each man to the end of the 400 is capable of\r\n    picking up the sword and commanding with it, which also means to\r\n    continue the fight until the last man in each regiment is killed\r\n    or disabled; in other words, the fight is never to be given up\r\n    except by total extinction. As an evidence of the interest and\r\n    earnestness of the Japanese people, it is customary, amongst the\r\n    trades-people, whenever a family that they have been supplying\r\n    with the necessaries of life is deprived of the father of the\r\n    family, in consequence of his going to the war, to continue to\r\n    supply all their needs the same as before and without sending\r\n    any bill therefor. It is pretty difficult, therefore, for the\r\n    Russians, notwithstanding that they so largely outnumber the\r\n    Japanese, to whip such a determined, forceful people either on\r\n    land or sea.\r\n\r\n    There is scarcely an important college anywhere in the world in\r\n    which Japanese students are not to be found studying for all\r\n    vocations, and they are bent upon acquiring the best and most\r\n    up-to-date methods in all walks of life. Admiral Togo was\r\n    educated at Annapolis, and the American, English, and\r\n    Continental colleges have educated many of Japan’s best army and\r\n    navy officers now engaged in the war.\r\n\r\n    The Japanese are not given much to invention, but they possess\r\n    great discernment and discrimination; they know a good thing\r\n    when they see it, and are very skilful in imitation. Fifty years\r\n    ago, when Commodore Perry successfully negotiated for the\r\n    opening of the Japanese ports, that nation’s intercourse with\r\n    the outside world commenced. A few years thereafter a commission\r\n    was appointed to frame a constitution. This commission visited\r\n    all the great nations in pursuit of information. They\r\n    familiarized themselves with the American constitution and the\r\n    basis of the government of other nations; they culled the best\r\n    from all and put it into their constitution. It took them seven\r\n    years to accomplish it. When they made their report to the\r\n    Emperor he accepted it without any modifications whatsoever, and\r\n    notwithstanding the great changes that have taken place in that\r\n    country in consequence of its growth and development, there has\r\n    been no occasion up to this date to in any way change that\r\n    document.\r\n\r\n    They also appointed thirty-five years ago a commission, with the\r\n    present great statesman, Marquis of Ito, at its head, to visit\r\n    the various nations with a view of obtaining the best\r\n    information possible in order to establish a financial system.\r\n    On their trip around the world to study the various foreign\r\n    financial systems with a view of adopting one up to date for\r\n    Japan, they first came to this country and brought official\r\n    letters to General Grant, then President. General Grant turned\r\n    them over to me to teach them our financial system. I posted\r\n    them up thoroughly on our financial methods. They then went to\r\n    England, France, and Germany, and returned to Japan via the Suez\r\n    Canal. On their return, their report strongly favored the\r\n    adoption of the American system. It was accepted by the\r\n    Government, and their Secretary of the Treasury appointed me\r\n    their agent to get up the engraving of their new currency and\r\n    bonds, similar to those of the United States Government. I sent\r\n    the phraseology and denominations of all our different demand\r\n    notes and various bonds to them, and they transferred the same\r\n    into their own hieroglyphics and sent them to me. I had the same\r\n    beautifully steel engraved through the Continental Bank Note\r\n    Company, who were the lowest bidders, in competition for the\r\n    work. Since that time I have kept up a most interesting and\r\n    exceedingly friendly acquaintance and correspondence with\r\n    Marquis Ito, and his recent letter to me contained much of\r\n    interest, as it gave most excellent reasons for Japan being\r\n    involved in the present war, which he said was not from his\r\n    country’s desire, but through necessity, as a matter of defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\n     THE NATIONAL CORPORATION PROBLEM.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  An address by Henry Clews, LL.D., delivered at the First Annual\r\n  Banquet of the Economic Club of Manchester, New Hampshire, May 20,\r\n  1908.\r\n\r\n_Mr. President and Members of the Economic Club_:\r\n\r\nThe political and popular clamor against the industrial Trusts, with\r\nwhich we have been long familiar, was due primarily to the anti-monopoly\r\nsentiment of the people, but in a far greater degree to the crushing of\r\ncompetitors, through unlawful and unjust methods, by some of the\r\nconspicuously large corporations, as Government prosecutions have shown.\r\n\r\nHence public hostility to the Trusts increased, and remedial legislation\r\nwas called for. The general feeling was that as a Trust had neither a\r\nbody to be kicked nor a soul to be damned it should be handled by the\r\nlaw without gloves, and with the utmost rigor.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of the railway rebating evil by which competition had been\r\ndestroyed, and great monopolies built up resulting in colossal fortunes\r\nfor their principal owners, added fuel to the fire of this indignation;\r\nand similar abuses and unlawful practices by certain Trusts showed how\r\nstrong combinations of capital had preyed upon, and killed off, weaker\r\nones, and individual traders, to an extent that made the injustice of it\r\na national scandal.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inflamed state of the public mind, some of the laws enacted\r\nto remedy the evils complained of may have been too drastic for the\r\npurpose. But excesses of this kind correct themselves. Such laws are\r\neither not enforced, or repealed after being enforced. As General Grant\r\nonce said to me,-“The surest way to repeal a bad law is to enforce it.”\r\nWe have fortunately always a safety valve in public opinion, which never\r\nerrs in the long run, and the public opinion of a nation is reflected in\r\nits laws.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of corporate interests in the United States is suggested\r\nby the fact that, including prominent city banks and Trust companies,\r\nthere are more than 20,000 corporations reported in the manuals devoted\r\nto them. Of these 1,512 are active, operating railway companies, 1,129\r\nelectric traction companies, 1,158 gas, electric light and electric\r\npower companies, 267 water companies, 259 telephone, telegraph and cable\r\ncompanies, 1,510 active, operating and producing industrial and\r\nmiscellaneous companies, 880 active or operating mining companies, and\r\n13,500 banking, insurance and other financial companies.\r\n\r\nThe railway companies cover 222,013 miles, and they had a capitalization\r\nand bonded debt, on the 1st of January, 1908, of $13,908,456,846, at\r\npar.\r\n\r\nThe industrial and miscellaneous companies had at the same date a\r\ncapitalization of $9,849,833,000, and the stocks of all the corporations\r\nin the United States aggregated more than $33,600,000,000 at par,\r\nexclusive of banks, Trust companies and other financial institutions.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the present enormous railway mileage of the country,\r\nit is interesting to note that as recently as 1865 there were only 3,085\r\nmiles in operation; and in 1879—the year of specie resumption, after the\r\nlong civil war suspension from 1861—this total had only increased to\r\n86,556 miles.\r\n\r\nThese figures remind us of the great rapidity with which new railway\r\ncorporations were subsequently organized, and laid their tracks, while\r\nold ones extended their lines from Maine to California, and the St.\r\nLawrence to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe can also remember the nation’s phenomenal progress simultaneously in\r\nall other directions, and that, before 1880, Trust companies and\r\nindustrial corporations were few and far between in comparison with the\r\ngreat multitude of those with which we have now to deal. The modern era\r\nof these striking features of our business life, and the development of\r\nthe industrial Trusts which now cover the country, East, West, North and\r\nSouth, had then hardly commenced.\r\n\r\nYet our great corporations, and our great railway systems are still\r\ngrowing and multiplying, and will continue to grow and multiply to meet\r\nthe wants of our rapidly increasing population for generations to come,\r\ntill every part of our vast territory is thickly settled. Railways and\r\nmanufactories represent our largest corporations, and are next in\r\nimportance to our unlimited agricultural resources and mining interests.\r\n\r\nThey remind us too, that while these and all other corporations need\r\nregulation by law, this regulation should never hamper, or interfere\r\nwith, their legitimate activities and expansion, however strict and\r\nsevere it may be in prohibiting and punishing wilful violations of law\r\nand other abuses of power.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the power and extent of our railway systems that\r\nthese—fifty-seven of them in all—operate, or control, six hundred and\r\neighty-eight subsidiaries, or jointly controlled railway companies,\r\nembracing 196,425 miles of road, with an aggregate of outstanding stock\r\nof $4,750,325,000, and $8,180,780,000 of bonds, a total for both, at\r\npar, of $12,931,154,000. These figures are exclusive of stocks and bonds\r\nheld in the treasuries of the companies.\r\n\r\nThus nearly ninety per cent of the steam railway mileage of the United\r\nStates is operated, or controlled, by the fifty-seven systems. The\r\nremaining ten per cent of the country’s railway mileage is composed\r\nmainly of short, independent and disconnected lines, some of which are\r\nrun at a loss, and many without reporting any considerable profit.\r\n\r\nRailway corporations in this country are therefore, except as to this\r\nunimportant ten per cent, a great consolidated force, for the\r\nfifty-seven systems that control ninety per cent of the mileage, are\r\nequivalent to so many Trusts, and these can join hands in a solid\r\nphalanx at any time for any lawful purpose, and practically form one\r\ngreat railway Trust spanning the continent, a gigantic power that but\r\nfor law would be a monopoly.\r\n\r\nSo the National corporation problem is largely one of the railways, and\r\nit involves the best way for the Federal Government to regulate these,\r\nand all the corporations, in the interest of trade, commerce and the\r\npeople, and to do this without imposing unnecessary restrictions upon\r\ntheir legitimate operations and development.\r\n\r\nThe corporation problem in this country is still new and unsolved, but\r\nit has assumed immense national importance through the growth of the\r\nlarge industrial Trusts during the last twenty years. Before that they\r\nwere unknown, and they have to a large extent revolutionized business\r\nand business methods in the United States.\r\n\r\nThey resulted from the enormous and rapid increase of our population,\r\nindustrial activity, industrial development and wealth, and the\r\nconsequent increase of competition in all branches of trade.\r\nCorporations, good, bad and indifferent, sprang up like mushrooms, and\r\nthen combinations of corporations into larger ones took place, and we\r\nhad Trusts.\r\n\r\nThese were organized ostensibly to secure economies in management which,\r\nin conjunction with their large capital, would enable them to compete\r\nadvantageously with smaller concerns in the same lines of business, and\r\ngive them more or less control of their markets.\r\n\r\nBut in doing this they of course threw many out of employment, and\r\nforced many of their smaller competitors out of business. Consequently\r\nthe popular sentiment against them at first was very strong and the cry\r\nof “Monopoly” was often heard.\r\n\r\nIt was found however that the rise in prices that had been generally\r\napprehended as a result of the formation of Trusts did not occur, at\r\nleast not to any disturbing extent. So public hostility to them quieted\r\ndown, although their struggling and ruined competitors still felt sore\r\nover their rivals’ success, all the more so when it was discovered that\r\nmost of them were making far larger profits than had ever before been\r\nmade in the same industries. If this had always been done honestly there\r\nwould have been no reason to complain.\r\n\r\nThe great industries dominated by Trusts included, besides petroleum and\r\nsugar refining, iron and steel working, copper and other metal and\r\nmineral mining, India rubber and tobacco manufacturing, distilling, and\r\nalso many miscellaneous manufactures, in addition to those in other\r\nlines than manufacturing. The traders who had occupied these fields of\r\nindustry before them looked small indeed beside these new corporation\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination in favor of one and against another by railway\r\ncorporations was an iniquity that built up large fortunes for a few and\r\nstarved and ruined many. But that, let us hope, has been effectually\r\nstopped forever by its exposure and denunciation by President Roosevelt\r\nand the Federal legislation which it provoked; and any revival of it\r\nshould be punished with the utmost rigor of the law, not by fines but by\r\nimprisonment of both the giver and receiver of rebates.\r\n\r\nFines can be easily paid by large corporations, however much their\r\nstockholders may suffer, but being placed behind iron bars is always\r\ndistasteful, if not terrible, to their officers; and it leaves a stigma\r\nthat they are anxious to avoid.\r\n\r\nTheir aversion to being disgraced in the eyes of their families and\r\nfriends by imprisonment as criminals will always tend to make them\r\nextremely cautious not to incur this risk, however willing through lack\r\nof moral scruples, some of them might be to violate the anti-rebate laws\r\nif they could do so with impunity, and however much they might be aware\r\nthat lawlessness, apart from the question of dishonesty, is anarchy, and\r\ntherefore unpatriotic.\r\n\r\nCorporation looting in its various forms, and political contributions of\r\ncorporation money, are, like rebating, equally wrong in principle, and\r\nshould be punished with equal severity and involve compulsory\r\nrestitution. That is really the only way to prevent the recurrence of\r\nsuch wrongs by the unprincipled.\r\n\r\nJudge Anderson, in charging the jury at the trial of John R. Walsh in\r\nChicago for bank frauds, said: “The law presumes that every man\r\nunderstands and foresees the natural, legitimate and inevitable\r\nconsequences of his acts. The color of the act determines the complexion\r\nof the intent. The intent to injure or defraud may be presumed when the\r\nunlawful act which results in loss or injury is proved to have been\r\nknowingly committed.”\r\n\r\nMany of the irregularities, abuses and questionable methods of large\r\ncorporations resulted no doubt from the haphazard speculative manner in\r\nwhich they were organized. Their promoters and organizers had always, or\r\nnearly always, speculative objects in view in forming the combinations\r\nwe call Trusts. They looked for their first profit in the stock deals\r\ninvolved in them, and were generally willing to give extravagant prices,\r\npayable in stock, for properties that they wished to control and bring\r\ninto these new Trusts.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, caused overcapitalization, and in many cases this\r\novercapitalization was equivalent to several times the actual value of\r\nthe properties embraced in the Trusts created, and in some instances to\r\nmany times their value. Then too extravagantly high salaries were given\r\nto the men in control of such organizations for their services as\r\nofficers. They were generally “on the make,” working for Number One—that\r\nis for themselves—as well as the Trusts.\r\n\r\nIt often followed that, in their efforts to float their stock and pay\r\ndividends, loose and none too scrupulous practices were resorted to, and\r\nmore or less false and exaggerated representations were made as to\r\nactual values and conditions. So greed and graft dominated not a few of\r\nthem more than the interests of their outside stockholders.\r\n\r\nThey were in a position where they could help themselves to the cream,\r\nand leave the skim milk for the investors, and not many of them\r\nneglected their opportunity to skim the cream, and to feather their\r\nnests more or less, in the last few years, before stricter laws were\r\npassed by Congress and the States for the management of corporations.\r\n\r\nThe laxity of both the State and Federal laws with regard to\r\ncorporations, till recently, permitted much to be done in the dark,\r\nwhich is now rendered impossible by the light of publicity that is\r\nrequired by the new enactments, as well as by various prohibitions of\r\ndishonest practices, besides that crowning evil, railway rebating, that\r\nwere before prevalent.\r\n\r\nCampaign contributions by corporations were wrong, morally and legally,\r\nnot because political contributions are wrong, but because they were a\r\nwrongful and illegal use of corporate money. But the controlling\r\nofficers of many large corporations, particularly the New York City\r\nRailways and large life insurance companies, were woefully blind to\r\nthis, so accustomed had they been to handling corporate funds in their\r\ncharge as if they owned them, and could do as they pleased.\r\n\r\nThese transactions were almost on a par with some of those connected\r\nwith the purchase at a fictitious price of a certain Street Railway—a\r\npractically non-existent line—in which large capitalists were concerned.\r\nHere was a flagrant instance—involving a diversion of half a million\r\ndollars—of the doings of men controlling a great street railway system,\r\nat the expense of the stockholders whom it was their duty to faithfully\r\nserve and protect.\r\n\r\nThat many dishonest acts by men controlling corporations have gone\r\nunpunished is greatly to be regretted, and looks very much like a\r\nmiscarriage of justice. But let us believe that dishonesty was\r\nexceptional and honesty the rule in corporate management.\r\n\r\nWhere punishment is inflicted for infractions of the law involving\r\nlarceny, it should be the same as for giving or receiving railway\r\nrebates. Fines have no terrors for wealthy evildoers who violate the law\r\nfor their own sinister ends at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nThe popular hostility to the Trusts however, was often too\r\nindiscriminate. It made little or no distinction between the good and\r\nthe bad. The Trusts were, as enlarged corporations with large capital, a\r\nnational trade development of our time.\r\n\r\nAiming at greater production, economy and efficiency, through their\r\nlarge means and modern improvements, than had been possible with small\r\nconcerns, they marked a forward step in that progressive industrial,\r\ncommercial and financial march which has created our vast national\r\nwealth and made this country the Wonder of the World.\r\n\r\nBut of course it was inevitable that these Trusts, with their large\r\ncapital, and new and improved methods and machinery, should supersede to\r\na great extent the old order of things, and take away from them the\r\nbusiness of others that they competed with. It is only natural that the\r\nstronger competitors should more or less dominate or destroy the weaker,\r\nand the success of the Trusts was merely another illustration of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. This is a law of Nature which it is useless to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not against the creation of Trusts, but against\r\ninjustice, lawlessness, misrepresentation, looting and other evil\r\npractices in the management of Trusts that we have a good right to\r\ncomplain, and against which the strong arm of the law should be always\r\nraised. A well and honestly managed Trust can do business as\r\nlegitimately, and with as much or more, advantage to the public, as any\r\nindividual, any firm, or any small corporation can.\r\n\r\nBut there is constantly greater temptation to wrongdoing by those in\r\ncontrol of large corporations than is the case in small ones. We have\r\nseen many instances of the abuse of power in these, not only in forcing\r\nthe allowance of rebates from the railways, but in other unjustifiable\r\nways calculated to get the upper hand of competitors, or kill them off\r\nentirely, as well as in the misuse of corporate funds for speculative\r\npurposes, to say nothing of appropriations through that too common form\r\nof dishonesty called graft.\r\n\r\nMen in high positions in corporations have often done in secret, in the\r\nway of chicanery what they would have been both ashamed and afraid to do\r\nopenly. But now that the old practices have been exposed and the new\r\nlaws require publicity of accounts, and have closed the door to the many\r\nopportunities for fraud and graft that were before open, through severe\r\npenalties, we have a purer business atmosphere and a higher moral tone\r\nin our business life. So some good has come out of our corporation\r\nscandals, and public sentiment has been aroused against corporate\r\ncorruption and all abuses of power.\r\n\r\nCorporations no less than individuals of course have rights which should\r\nbe scrupulously respected by both our Federal and State legislators. But\r\none defect in corporation legislation by Congress, as well as the\r\nStates, has often been that it failed to make a sufficient distinction\r\nbetween what may be called private and public corporations. It stands to\r\nreason that railway and industrial corporations, and all public utility\r\ncompanies, that have sold their stocks and bonds to the public, and had\r\nthem admitted to dealings on the stock exchanges should have their\r\ncondition subjected to stated periodical examinations and publicity\r\nwhich would be uncalled for in the case of smaller corporations that had\r\nnot marketed any of their securities, and whose earnings and affairs had\r\nno interest for the general public.\r\n\r\nThe railway companies are now required by law to keep their books and\r\naccounts in a certain prescribed form under the supervision of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commissioners, and this is the right kind of\r\npublicity, for it permits of no cheating, nor of any neglect to comply\r\nwith the law. The record of each day’s business tells the story and\r\nthese books and accounts are all the time open to Government inspection.\r\nBut such regulations would be unreasonable if applied to the small\r\nprivate industrial corporations.\r\n\r\nHonestly managed and solvent corporations have nothing to fear from\r\npublicity as to their financial condition, although they have a perfect\r\nright to guard their trade secrets from publicity, provided they are\r\nfree from any dishonest or illegal taint. Well and honestly managed\r\npublic utility corporations are our best protection against municipal\r\nownership, which in this country would be sure to involve political\r\ncorruption, and probably poor service.\r\n\r\nIt would be a step towards socialism, and socialism in this country\r\nwould be antagonistic to our government, our institutions and our\r\nnational progress, and should be resolutely resisted and frowned upon by\r\nall Americans. It is a weed transplanted from the hotbeds of European\r\ndespotism that can never flourish here, for our soil is entirely\r\nunsuited to it.\r\n\r\nPublicity at regular intervals of earnings and conditions by railway,\r\nindustrial and other corporations creates confidence where confidence is\r\nmerited, while exposing weakness where weakness exists. By eliminating\r\nthat which is unsound and dangerous, it benefits the sound and the safe,\r\nand removes grounds of suspicion injurious to all.\r\n\r\nSecrecy is the defense of the weak, and they naturally shirk the light;\r\nbut the public interests demand that all the large corporations submit\r\nto it, and stand or fall according to their merits. This applies to\r\nbanking and insurance as well as manufacturing, trading and\r\ntransportation corporations, all, in this respect being in the same\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this publicity and ensure simplicity and accuracy the\r\nbooks and statistics of corporations should be kept in a clear and\r\nsystematic manner that any examiner could easily understand. I say this\r\nbecause in some large corporation failures that have occurred much\r\nirregularity and confusion of accounts was found.\r\n\r\nThis not only delayed the receivers in ascertaining the amount of the\r\nassets and liabilities, but showed that the officers of the failed\r\nconcerns could not have been very closely conversant with their precise\r\ncondition when they suspended. Bad, or careless book keeping, accounting\r\nand office management has led to many important corporation failures\r\nthat good work in that department might have averted.\r\n\r\nCorporations should therefore, be careful to supervise their clerical\r\nforces closely, and also employ accountants to make periodical\r\nexaminations and audits of their books, for accounting and statistics in\r\nthese days have been raised to the importance of a science.\r\n\r\nOld fogyism, wherever it still exists, should be made to give place to\r\nimproved and time saving modern methods. These may be small matters to\r\ndwell upon, but a close observance of them is necessary to good\r\ncorporate management in this age of close competition and aggressive\r\nenterprise. All that is out of date, or needless, or a drag upon\r\nprogress, or which handicaps business development should be promptly\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nThe political influence of large corporations has so far not received as\r\nmuch consideration as it deserves. But it is a factor in our State and\r\nnational business life that is more and more making itself felt in an\r\nunobtrusive but none the less effective way.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this manifested in the strong and numerous protests,\r\nemanating from this source, against the national government and the\r\ninterstate commerce commission consenting to the general rise of freight\r\nrates conditionally agreed upon by the Eastern and other railways. In\r\nmaking these protests to President Roosevelt the corporations are well\r\naware that he can control the action of the interstate commissioners in\r\nthe matter, and by a word cause them to either give or refuse permission\r\nto raise railway rates. They know too that his keen political\r\nobservation and insight will cause him to weigh and consider with the\r\ngreatest care the effect of the administration’s course in consenting,\r\nor refusing to consent, to this inconsistent proposal to raise railway\r\nfreight rates in such a period of trade depression as this, when more\r\nthan 413,000 cars are idle. In view of the Presidential Campaign, and\r\nthe issue to be decided at the polls next November, not merely by the\r\npoliticians, but by the people, he will not underrate the importance of\r\nthe railway corporation question as a political factor.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the President’s communication to the interstate\r\ncommissioners a short time ago directing an investigation by them in\r\nrelation to the need of the proposal of the Southern railways to reduce\r\nwages, resulted in an immediate abandonment of their announced plan to\r\nreduce them, and in fact all the railways were similarly influenced by\r\nthat act of his. He knew that the reduction in one section would be the\r\nentering wedge for a general reduction, and perhaps a strike.\r\n\r\nSo the railways switched off the reduced wages line to the increased\r\nfreight line, thinking that the President, from what he had said, as he\r\nsurveyed the situation from his political observatory, would prefer the\r\nalternative of higher freight rates to lower wages. Here comes the rub.\r\nIt is a two-edged political sword that President Roosevelt, above all\r\nothers, will see requires to be very cautiously handled.\r\n\r\nWithout great care in this difficulty the administration might find\r\nitself between the upper and the nether millstone of a very ugly\r\nquestion, and in active antagonism with either the large corporations\r\nand the whole mercantile community, on the one hand, or the railways, on\r\nthe other, with both sides bringing all their political influence and\r\nartillery into play.\r\n\r\nHere would be an acrimonious contest that could not fail to affect\r\npolitical results in November. The President would very naturally be\r\nanxious to avert it, but how to reconcile the two opposite courses of\r\nsaying yea or nay to the railways, and secure harmony between them and\r\nLabor, is a problem hard to solve.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the proposition agreed to by the officers of the\r\nEastern trunk railways to advance freight rates from ten to fourteen per\r\ncent, it is well to consider that the gross earnings of all reporting\r\nlines in February showed a decrease of twelve and one half per cent from\r\nthose of last year, and that in March the decrease was 14⅜ per cent, the\r\nresult of the prevailing industrial depression, particularly in the\r\niron, steel and coal trade and the New England cotton and woolen milling\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed increase would, of course, have to be added to the cost of\r\nthe commodities carried, and saddled upon the consumers. It was\r\ntherefore to be expected that a flood of indignant protests would come\r\nfrom these, as well as from large shippers and the rank and file of the\r\nmercantile community. They have urged the injustice of such an advance\r\nin these hard times, and in the teeth of an average contraction of fully\r\ntwenty-five per cent in the demand for goods. But the railways in reply\r\npoint to the refusal of the U. S. Steel Corporation and other large\r\ntrade combinations to lower their prices for railway materials, as well\r\nas to the political and other work of the Labor Unions, at Washington\r\nand elsewhere, in support of their determination to keep wages up to the\r\nhighest figures of prosperous times, refusing meanwhile to listen to any\r\nterms of wage readjustment to the situation as it is. These are\r\nextenuating circumstances, but two wrongs do not make a right; and the\r\nbest way of adjusting these differences is a difficult corporation and\r\nlabor problem of itself.\r\n\r\nIt may surprise some to learn that the great power concentrated in the\r\nPresident’s hands by Congress has made the great corporations, including\r\nthe railway companies and banking institutions, ambitious and eager to\r\ncontrol the Federal Government itself, and they are resolutely working\r\nto control it as far as they can by the force of capital, but as\r\nunobtrusively as possible. They know that their designs to make the\r\nmoney power supreme would arouse popular indignation, so they are\r\nengaged in a still hunt, and Samuel J. Tilden used to say that this is\r\nwhat wins in politics and a political campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Government control of the Trusts, the railways and other\r\ncorporations has become so great that it is hardly to be wondered at\r\nthat the great object that they have now in view should be to control\r\nthe government’s policy, and already they are _sub rosa_ powerful\r\npolitical machines. In this connection it is significant that some large\r\nrailway and banking interests have identified themselves with the\r\nPresidential movement. Every fresh extension by Congress of the\r\nPresident’s power over corporate interests has made the large\r\ncorporations—industrial, railway and financial—with their enormous\r\ncapital and resources, more and more bold and determined in their\r\nefforts to control the Presidency, if indeed that is possible; and this\r\nmotive underlies a great and growing amount of corruption in our\r\nNational politics.\r\n\r\nWe can therefore see in the attitude and views of the great\r\ncorporations, with their wealth and political influence, a possible\r\nmenace to our Republic and its free institutions.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of vast and vital concern to our citizens, and it is\r\nhigh time that their serious attention should be called to the fact that\r\nthe powers with which the President is invested over the business of all\r\nclasses of corporations have become so extended and far reaching that\r\nthe Trusts and their railway and financial allies, are ready to\r\nsacrifice any moral principle, and pay any price within their power, to\r\ncontrol the policy of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nSo the greatest of all the National corporation problems we have now to\r\ndeal with is how to curb and regulate, without injustice, the increasing\r\npolitical power and pernicious political activity of these and other\r\ncorporations, and prevent them from accomplishing their great object,\r\nGovernment control, for this indeed would be a National calamity.\r\n\r\nTo President Roosevelt we are almost entirely indebted for the\r\ndevelopment we have witnessed in the National control of corporations\r\nunder the authority of that provision of the Constitution which invests\r\nCongress with the power to regulate commerce between the States. This\r\nwas a great task well performed, and only second to it in importance has\r\nbeen his activity in promoting Congressional legislation for the\r\ninvestigation, conservation and increase of the country’s National\r\nresources, including the irrigation of arid regions, the establishment\r\nin the public domain of forest reserves, which had been too long\r\nneglected, and the extension and increased efficiency of the geological\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to those National interests and the Federal management\r\nand control of corporations has been the President’s direction of the\r\nwork of the Department of Commerce and Labor, the act creating which\r\nprovides that it shall be its duty “to foster, promote and develop the\r\nforeign and domestic commerce, the mining, manufacturing and fishing\r\nindustries, the labor interests and the transportation interests of the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\nAs all the business of the country outside of banking and finance, is\r\npractically covered by this Department, its importance can hardly be\r\noverestimated, especially in relation to the great corporations; and it\r\nis in co-operation between these and the commercial organizations of the\r\nUnited States, in common with all the other designated business\r\ninterests of the country, and this branch of the Federal Government,\r\nthat harmony and good corporate management can be best promoted, and the\r\npolitical power and aspirations of the Trusts, the railways and the\r\nother corporations be effectually regulated and permanently curbed. To\r\nthis result that Department’s energies should steadily tend, for the\r\npolitical domination of this country by Trusts and the money power would\r\nbe an intolerable evil, however much it might be hidden and disguised.\r\nIt would be inimical to our form of government, and the spirit of all\r\nAmerican institutions, and to ward off this threatened danger, by\r\nnipping it in the bud, is a public duty that the government owes to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed likely to become our great National corporation problem;\r\nall the other problems relating to the Trusts, the banks and the\r\nrailways being subordinate to this in importance, for it aims at\r\npolitical power for Capital, which would undermine the very foundations\r\nof our great and glorious republic—the government for which the patriots\r\nof the American Revolution fought so bravely at Bunker Hill, and then,\r\ncrowned with victory, made 1776 glorious with the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nBut forewarned, forearmed, and public opinion the great court of appeal,\r\nwill always govern and keep the Trusts as well as all our other great\r\nbusiness interests in line for the advancement of our National welfare\r\nand the prosperity of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XC.\r\n\r\n             WHY I AM AN AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI came to this country from England over fifty years ago, expecting to\r\nstay for merely a short visit. I had barely learned the localities of\r\nthe public buildings and the principal streets, when I began to perceive\r\nthe possibilities that presented themselves to a young man, who had the\r\ncourage to push, to compete for a place in the race for wealth and\r\nposition. I liked the hustle and the bustle that contrasted so vividly\r\nwith the slow and easy style which prevailed in my native country. I\r\ncould not escape being drawn into the spirit which surrounded me, and I\r\nmade up my mind that I would make my stand in life in New York, and I\r\nsought and found employment. Fortunately I had letters of introduction\r\nto people of culture and refinement, so my social surroundings were both\r\nattractive and beneficial. In a few years the Civil War broke out and\r\nthe leaven was thereby added to the liking I had for the flag which\r\nfloats for freedom, and I became a more ardent American than though this\r\nhad been my native soil. I had the good fortune to meet the great men of\r\nthose days and they whetted my appetite to rise to their level, and much\r\nof my success is due to the quiet influence they exerted upon my young\r\nmind. When I landed in New York, most o what is now the great West, was\r\nboundless prairie or dense forest, but even then the indomitable spirit\r\nof people around me yearned to subdue this wilderness and make it\r\nblossom and bear fruit. Millionaires were few in those days and\r\ntruthfulness and honesty, combined with a willingness to work, were the\r\nnecessary requisites to enable a young fellow to succeed. The fact that\r\nthis was a government for the people, and by the people, did much to\r\ndetermine me that here I had found the promised land. No aristocracy to\r\ncontend with but the aristocracy of brains and courage; no traditions of\r\ncenturies to hang between you and your right to toe the scratch with any\r\nman. The country was growing beyond its population and immigration was\r\ninvited in such an attractive way that the desirable classes from all\r\nover Europe were drawn to our shores. The fact that men born in humble\r\nlife had become some of the world’s leaders proved the possibilities\r\nthat might come to any one who cared to try and who had the courage not\r\nto know when he was beaten. In this country Congress has always made,\r\nand is still making, laws that benefit all kinds and conditions of men\r\nwho behave themselves. Before the law neither blue blood nor family tree\r\nprotects any man who violates the statutes, for all are free and equal.\r\nThis nation has never fought for conquest of territory and wherever our\r\nflag floats it has a moral and undisputed right to do so.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is but a summary of the volumes I might add to the reasons\r\nwhy I am an American. One more is that I cannot help being an American\r\nand I don’t want to.\r\n\r\n                                                            HENRY CLEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I wish to ask public indulgence on account of omissions.\r\n\r\nThere are many brilliant financiers and skillful operators of the\r\nyounger generation in Wall Street who have thus far shown that they are\r\nprobably destined to a prosperous, and in some instances, an illustrious\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are others of various ages and long experience, whose\r\nachievements have been of a quiet, unostentatious character and whose\r\nbusiness lives and operations have been conducted with great reserve,\r\nyet with marked success.\r\n\r\nAlthough these two classes have not yet done much to make their\r\nexistence conspicuous in the public eye, while some of them, through\r\nexcess of modesty, perhaps, have even shunned publicity, yet their lives\r\nhave been replete with noteworthy events and the acquisition of very\r\nuseful knowledge which, if preserved and recorded, would be highly\r\ninteresting in the present, and probably not unworthy of being\r\ntransmitted to the future.\r\n\r\nI have a considerable number of these clever and worthy gentlemen in\r\n“the volume of my brain,” for whom I have no space in this book, as it\r\nhas already exceeded the dimensions which I had originally designed, but\r\nin an additional volume I intend that they shall be duly remembered\r\naccording to the best of my humble ability and my opportunities of\r\nforming a just estimate of their deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ The page number of final chapter (\"CONCLUSION\") was added to the\r\n      Table of Contents.\r\n    ○ A few illustrations were moved to be closer to the appropriate\r\n      text.\r\n    ○ Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\r\n      when a predominant form was found in this book.\r\n    ○ Text that:\r\n      was in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_);\r\n      was in bold by is enclosed by “equal” signs (=bold=).",
