No attempt was made to cover the wide\r\nfield of postal activity and inquiry for which a much larger book\r\nand much greater space would be required. It is simply meant to be a\r\nbook of reference, a sort of hand-book on postal subjects for busy\r\npeople who may not care to read lengthy accounts or stories which a\r\nfew paragraphs might sufficiently explain, or care to wrestle with\r\ncolumns of figures which are best given in official reports and chiefly\r\nvaluable to public men for legislative purposes, for comparison and\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nAll necessary postal knowledge of immediate public interest is herein\r\nset forth in such compact shape as to acquaint the reader with what\r\nhe might want to know, or direct his inquiry to sources of wider\r\ninformation if the desire was not satisfied with the reference thereto\r\nwhich this work might afford. In general it will be found amply\r\nsufficient for all ordinary purpose as the scope of subjects is as wide\r\nas the active operations of the Department at present include.\r\n\r\nThe special articles referring to subjects of general postal interest\r\ncover a considerable range of inquiry and deal more fully with those\r\nmatters which are but briefly mentioned in that portion devoted to the\r\npurely business details of the Department. Much of this material is\r\nnew and all of it treated so as to interest the reader. These articles\r\non general postal topics in connection with the other matter herewith\r\ngiven, relating to the service, may please some one here and there and\r\nperhaps justify the publication of this little contribution to the\r\nliterature of the time.\r\n\r\n  L. M.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  March 15, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Ruskin McArdle, late Private Secretary to the Postmaster\r\nGeneral, now Chief Clerk of the Department, whose friendly regard I\r\nhave long enjoyed and whose courteous and considerate treatment to all\r\nwith whom his official relations have brought him into contact, this\r\nlittle volume is respectfully dedicated as a mark of appreciation and a\r\ntoken of deep and lasting esteem.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operations of the postal service are conducted by divisional\r\narrangement with the duties of each accurately and specifically\r\ndefined. Previous to this administration much of the work of the\r\nvarious bureaus was found to be overlapping each other and exercising\r\na separate authority in correlated matters. These officially related\r\nduties were each brought under a proper head, insuring prompt attention\r\nand fixing a definite responsibility which has been found to be of\r\nrecognized benefit and value.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL\r\n\r\n  _Postmaster General._--ALBERT S.

The contention is whether\r\nthe basis of payment shall be by weight or by the space used. While\r\nthe space rate is the higher of the two it lends itself to rational\r\nreadjustment, and is therefore best for government needs. The tests\r\nmade show a saving of about $7,000,000 per annum by the space method.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency standard now required of Postmasters, has it is stated,\r\ngreatly improved the service and the announced policy of the Department\r\nto reappoint all those who render meritorious service has been adhered\r\nto and will be continued.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending June 30, 1917, 38 second class offices were\r\nadvanced to the first class; 135 third class to second, and 1,203\r\nfourth class to third. Average annual salary of post-office clerks is\r\nnow $1,142 per annum, city carriers $1,126.50.\r\n\r\nRemovals of employees for cause are now rarely made, statistics show\r\nless than one per cent in both the post office and city carrier service.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that where because of unusual conditions, rural\r\ncarriers cannot be obtained at the maximum rate of pay, advertisements\r\nbe issued calling for proposals for the performance of such service.\r\n\r\nMotor vehicle routes are now in operation on a total length of over\r\n41,000 miles, averaging 54 miles per route, at an average cost of\r\n$1,786.49 per route.\r\n\r\nThere are now 43,463 rural routes in operation, covering 1,112,556\r\nmiles. Cost of rural service decreased 0.011 per patron during the year\r\n1917; cost per mile decreased 0.114 cent per mile.\r\n\r\nThe cost per mile of travel by star-route contractors is $0.1024. Cost\r\nper mile of travel by rural carrier is $0.1510. This difference in cost\r\nis receiving departmental consideration.\r\n\r\nShipment of parcel post packages increased 14 per cent in 1917,\r\nthe increase representing more than 25,000,000 pieces. Cooperation\r\nof postmasters in bringing the insurance feature particularly that\r\nof partial damage prominently to public notice, has resulted in an\r\nincrease of over 8,000,000 insured parcels over the showing of 1916.\r\n\r\nGrowing carelessness in addressing letter mail resulted in 13,000,000\r\nletters being found undeliverable during 1917, an increase of 21 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe report shows an audited surplus for the year of $9,836,211 the\r\nlargest in the history of the department. The increase over the\r\npreceding year was 5.66 per cent, while the increase in cost was 4.45\r\nper cent. The audited revenues for the year amounted to $329,726,116.\r\n\r\nRemarkable growth in postal savings is shown. In 1917 there were\r\n674,728 depositors with a total of $131,954,696 to their credit.\r\nThe average balance for each depositor was $195.57.

In the first Book of Kings it is stated that Queen\r\nJezebel wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed with the King’s seal,\r\nand sent them to the elders and nobles in the city. In the Book of\r\nEsther mention is made of sending letters by posts to all the King’s\r\nprovinces. There are also evidences that the Assyrian and Persian\r\nnations established stations, or posts a day’s journey apart, at\r\nwhich horses were kept ready saddled with waiting couriers for the\r\ntransmission of public orders and edicts. Xenophon mentions that Cyrus\r\nemployed posts throughout his dominions and Herodotus speaks of the\r\nlarge structures erected for post stations. The mail service of China\r\ndates far back into antiquity. It is said that in the fourteenth\r\ncentury there were 10,000 mail stations in the empire. Peru, remarkable\r\nfor its early evidences of civilization, had according to the historian\r\nPrescott, communication established from one end of the country to\r\nthe other. There is, however, nothing to show that ordinary human\r\naffairs received any attention at this early period, the activities of\r\nrulers being devoted entirely to governmental interest and concern.\r\nThe affairs of commerce and trade were probably carried on by personal\r\nenterprise, by voyages of trade discovery by water or expeditions on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe method of using couriers for transmitting intelligence was\r\nevidently long continued, being the only means known by which such need\r\ncould be met, or the one which most naturally suggested itself. The\r\nRomans employed couriers for the promulgation of military and public\r\norders to their scattered provinces, private letters being sent by\r\nslaves or by such opportunity as occasion afforded. It is said that\r\nCharlemagne employed couriers for public purposes, but the practice\r\nwas discontinued after his death, special messengers being used when\r\noccasion required. England employed couriers for public purposes in the\r\nthirteenth century, and in the fourteenth century Louis XI returned to\r\nthe practice of employing mounted couriers and established stations\r\nbut only for government purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of Personal Communication\r\n\r\nAs early as the beginning of the thirteenth century the need of\r\npersonal communication was recognized and the University of Paris\r\narranged for the employment of foot-messengers to bear letters from its\r\nthousands of students to the various countries in Europe from whence\r\nthey came. This plan lasted until 1719. In the fifteenth century an\r\nattempt was made and the custom prevailed for some time, of sending\r\nletters by traveling tradesmen or dealers who made regular trips\r\nin certain directions for barter, purchase or sale. The tremendous\r\nstimulus given to the development of commercial conditions by the\r\ncrusades, made business intercourse necessary, and the post riders\r\nwho had surplus horses soon found use for them in the conveyance of\r\npassengers and ultimately in the transmission of general information\r\nwhich finally resulted in a fixed compensation and which method\r\nremained in use for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nThe real beginning of letter posts for private and business purposes,\r\ndates from the year 1516, when Roger, Count of Thurn, established\r\nriding posts in the Tyrol, connecting Germany and Italy. A letter post\r\nhad been established in the Hanse towns in the thirteenth century,\r\nbut the actual commencement of such activities dates from the year\r\n1516. The Emperor Charles V made these riding posts general throughout\r\nhis dominions and appointed Leonard, Count of Thurn, his postmaster\r\ngeneral. The Counts of Thurn and Taxis held this monopoly by regular\r\nsuccession for many years afterward. The rapid growth of English\r\ncivilization made postal progress necessary for its people and this\r\nbrings us to the period of most interest to students as well as the\r\naverage reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Postal History of England\r\n\r\nAs much of our postal system is naturally based on that of England from\r\nour early Colonial dependence, it is of interest to note the various\r\nsteps of English progress and development in connection with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe first English postmaster general of whom any account can be given\r\nwas Sir Brian Tuke, who is described on the records of the year 1533 as\r\n“Magister Nuncrorum, Cursorum, Sire, Postarum,” but long subsequent\r\nto this appointment of a postmaster general the details of the service\r\nwere frequently regulated by proclamation and by orders in council.\r\nDuring the earlier years of Queen Elizabeth, most of the business of\r\nthe postal service to and from England was managed by the incorporated\r\n“Merchant Strangers” who appointed special postmasters among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe accession of James I, necessitating more frequent communication\r\nbetween London and Scotland, led to many improvements in the postal\r\nservice. It was ordered that the posts should travel not less than\r\n7 miles an hour in summer and 5 miles in winter. In 1619 a separate\r\npostmaster general for foreign parts was created. Thomas Witherings\r\nwas one of the successors in this office and entitled to rank as one\r\nof the many conspicuous postal reformers in the continental service.\r\nAll letters were then carried by carriers or footpads 16 or 18 miles a\r\nday. It required two months to get answers from Scotland or Ireland to\r\nLondon. He directed that all northern mail be put into one “portmantle”\r\ndirected to Edinburgh and separate bags to such postmasters as lived\r\nupon the road near to any city or town corporate, which was the first\r\nstep in the separation of mail since carried to such perfection here\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nPenny Postage Attempted\r\n\r\nThe income from the post office in 1643 was but 5,000 pounds.\r\nUltimately the posts both inland and foreign were farmed out to John\r\nManley for 10,000 pounds a year by an agreement made in 1653. About\r\nthis time an attorney of York, named John Hill, ventured upon the plan\r\nof placing relays of post horses between that city and London and\r\nundertook to convey letters and parcels at half the former charge. He\r\naimed to establish penny postage for England, two-penny postage for\r\nScotland, and a four-penny postage for Ireland. But the post office\r\nwas regarded in that day as a means of revenue and incidentally of\r\npolitical espionage and government did not approve of such individual\r\nenterprise. His letter carriers were literally trampled down by\r\nCromwell’s soldiers, and the enterprising attorney narrowly escaped\r\nsevere punishment. Another attempt at penny postage for London was\r\nestablished by William Duckwra, a custom house employe, and Robert\r\nMurray, a clerk in the excise office. Duckwra carried for a penny\r\nand registered and insured, both letters and parcels up to a pound\r\nin weight and $10 in value. He established hourly collections and\r\nten deliveries daily for the central parts of London and six for the\r\nsuburbs. The Duke of York had, however, a patent covering this service\r\nand suits were laid against him which put an end to his enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe systematic employment of women in post office and telegraph service\r\nwas for a long time an experiment and a problem, but it afterwards\r\nproved a success. Under new regulations in 1870, women were employed\r\nas telegraphists for eight hours daily with pay according to age,\r\nintelligence and practical experience. At the close of 1880, there were\r\na thousand women so employed in the cities of London, Edinburgh, and\r\nDublin, and nearly as many in minor postal positions throughout the\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Post Office at London\r\n\r\nThe necessary authority for the establishment of a general post office\r\nat London to cover the British dominions, including the American\r\nColonies, was given by act of Parliament in 1657. Under this act the\r\npostal affairs of England were conducted for a great length of time\r\nwith but little if any improvement. It was not until the memorable\r\npamphlet of Sir Rowland Hill was issued in 1837 that any real progress\r\nwas made or any attempt made worthy of mention. Postal conditions were\r\nso unsatisfactory that he made the whole subject a matter of profound\r\ninquiry and his pamphlet on “Postal Reform” stirred the nation and\r\nled to a complete reformation of the entire postal system and was the\r\nbeginning of the British post office as we see it today.\r\n\r\nThe important events in English postal history given above and that\r\nwhich follows in chronological order are abridged from the Encyclopedia\r\nBrittanica, 1891--1720, organization of cross roads and rural posts;\r\n1753, establishment of post office in American Colonies under Benjamin\r\nFranklin; 1774, improved mail coaches and organized mail routes; 1821,\r\nfirst conveyance of mail by steam-packet; 1830, first mail coach by\r\nrailway; 1834, postage stamps invented by James Chalmers, Dundee,\r\nScotland; 1835, overland route to India; 1838, Postal money order\r\nsystem; 1840, general and uniform penny postage (per half ounce); 1855,\r\nfirst street letter boxes put up in London; 1856, Postal Guide issued;\r\n1861, Postal Savings Banks instituted; 1870, transfer of telegraph to\r\nstate and postal cars introduced; 1881, postal orders issued; 1883,\r\nparcel post established.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench and German Postal History\r\n\r\nThe French Postal System was founded by Louis XI in 1464. It was\r\nlargely extended by Charles IX, 1565, and generally improved under\r\nHenry IV and Louis XIII. Napoleon abolished the board system by which\r\nthe French service was then conducted and recommitted the business\r\nto a postmaster general as it had been under Louis XIII. Napoleon\r\ngreatly improved the service in all its details, and the measures he\r\nadopted and the reforms he introduced in 1802 remained in force for\r\nmany years afterward and are probably in use now with such additions\r\nas developments suggested. The most important reforms in French Postal\r\nHistory were the extension of postal facilities to all the communes,\r\neffected under Charles X, 1829; adoption of postage stamp, 1849, under\r\nLouis Napoleon. Issue of postal notes to bearer, 1860; Postal Savings\r\nBanks, instituted 1880.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Prussian or present German postal system was\r\nmainly due to Dr. Stephan, who was also the chief organizer of the\r\nInternational Postal Union. This Prussian system, incorporated into the\r\nadmirably organized post and telegraph service of the empire, began\r\nwith the Great Elector, 1646. In Strasburg a messenger code existed as\r\nearly as 1443. A postal service was organized at Nuremberg in 1570.\r\nThe first mail steam packet was built in 1821; the first transmission\r\nof mails by railway was in 1847; telegraph service in postal affairs,\r\n1849. A regular delivery by letter carriers attached to the state\r\npostal system existed in Berlin as early as 1712.\r\n\r\nThese principal items of postal history concerning France and Germany\r\nare condensed from the excellent articles upon the subject as found\r\nin the Encyclopedia Brittanica, edition of 1891, as well as the\r\ninformation on English postal history, for which acknowledgment is made\r\nin its proper place relating to the Postal History of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Colonial Period\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt to provide postal facilities for the colonies was\r\nin 1672 when Governor Lovelace, of the New York colony, established\r\nmonthly service between New York and Boston. An office was later\r\nestablished at Philadelphia from which weekly mail was received and\r\nsent. By the signing of letters patent in 1691 the control of the\r\nAmerican posts was vested in Thomas Neale, commonly called the “Neale\r\nPatent.” In that year Neale and the Royal Postmasters General appointed\r\nAndrew Hamilton, Postmaster General of America. All the colonies except\r\nVirginia cooperated with him in improving and extending the service.\r\nA weekly post was established between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to\r\nBoston, Saybrook, New York, Philadelphia, Maryland and Virginia. Five\r\nriders were engaged to cover each of the five stages twice a week.\r\nIn 1707 the crown purchased the good will of the American post and\r\ncontinued John Hamilton, the son of Andrew, in that office at an annual\r\nsalary of 200 pounds. In the year 1737, Franklin became postmaster\r\nat Philadelphia and generally supervised the other offices of the\r\ncolonies. In 1753 he was one of the deputy Postmasters General, but was\r\ndismissed in 1774 by Governor Hutchinson, of Massachusetts, because of\r\nhis adherence to the patriotic cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Continental Congress\r\n\r\nBut Franklin was not to remain idle for when the Continental Congress\r\nmet at its second session at Philadelphia, July 26, 1775, they resolved\r\nto have a post office system of their own and he was selected to carry\r\non the work. A salary of $1,000 per annum was voted him with permission\r\nto employ a secretary and a comptroller with a salary of $340 per\r\nannum to each, and a line of posts ordered established from Falmouth,\r\nNew England, to Savannah, Ga., with postages 20 per centum less than\r\nthose afforded by parliament. However, Franklin’s great diplomatic\r\nability soon secured him a transfer to a wider field of usefulness and\r\nhis son-in-law, Richard Bache, who had been comptroller, was named\r\nto succeed him. The ledger kept by this gentleman is still preserved\r\namong the archives of the Department. It consists of about 3 quines of\r\nfoolscap, written over in a neat and legible hand. Ebenezer Hazard,\r\nwho had been the Constitutional postmaster at New York, so termed to\r\ndistinguish him from the British deputy at that place, was appointed\r\nto succeed him. In 1782, an act was passed by the Colonial Congress\r\nestablishing a line of posts between New Hampshire and Georgia, the\r\nsalary of the deputies not to exceed 20 per cent of the revenues.\r\nThe rate of postage at that time on letters weighing not over 1\r\npenny-weight and going not more than 60 miles was equal to 5½ cents and\r\na proportionate charge for greater weights and distances.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown Postmasters\r\n\r\nIn a well-written article in the Washington, D. C., _Evening Star_, of\r\nJuly 26, 1913, upon the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred\r\nand thirty-eighth year of the American postal service, the activities\r\nor self-assumed powers of the English or crown postmasters and its\r\neffect in encouraging the independent sentiment of the time was stated\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n “These crown postmasters had, or at least they exercised, the right of\r\n ‘spying’ upon the mails intrusted to their care. This made it difficult\r\n and dangerous for the liberty-loving colonists to communicate with\r\n each other. The zealous representatives of England also professed to\r\n exercise a supervising care over the newspapers which were printed in\r\n the colonies, and made arbitrary rules and regulations against those\r\n who were too liberal or outspoken in their expressions of condemnation\r\n of things as they then were and who dared to urge the liberty and\r\n independence of the colonists. Some papers were shut out of the mails\r\n and some were forced to tone down their utterances. A pound sterling was\r\n demanded to carry 250 papers, 130 miles.\r\n\r\n “The post office led in the unification of the colonists. Paul Revere\r\n was the confidential post rider of Massachusetts. The tea party in\r\n Boston Harbor would have been but a neighborhood affair but for the\r\n agency of the post office and the patriotic publishers who spread the\r\n news up and down the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n “The postal service did more than any one other agency to unify and\r\n unite the colonists. It brought their interests and endeavors to a\r\n common meeting point. It brought the leading men and women to know and\r\n exchange ideas one with another. Printing presses were established about\r\n the same time that the postal service was begun in America. Postmasters\r\n enjoyed the privilege of sending their mail free of postage, so most\r\n postmasters became publishers. In this way the news of the doings of the\r\n various jealous colonists was disseminated and the opinions of these\r\n early postmaster-publishers were given wide circulation. It added an\r\n incentive to trade and intercourse. By making the colonists acquainted\r\n it dissipated jealousies. The growth of the post office from the humble\r\n beginning of a sturdy carrier from New York to Boston loaded with\r\n ‘divers letters and small portable packages’ (you see they had parcel\r\n post even in those days), solidified the colonists and made their\r\n independence possible.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPost Offices and Post Roads Established\r\n\r\nDuring the Continental Government, the receipts of all the post offices\r\ndid not exceed $35,000 and in 1789 were $10,000 less. February 20,\r\n1792, an act was passed establishing post offices and post roads within\r\nthe United States, the first general law. The contracts made were to\r\nrun eight years and the salary of the Postmaster General was increased\r\nto $2,000, and $1,000 for his Assistant. The original number of post\r\noffices (that is for the first year) was seventy-five and the mail\r\nroutes less than 2,000 miles over which mails were carried by horse,\r\nstage, or sailing packets. In 1795, the number of postoffices had\r\nincreased to 453, and the routes to over 13,000, and the net revenue to\r\nover $42,000. This closes the period of Continental management, except\r\nordinary details and changes which bore no relation to any especial\r\nobject or purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period of Progress\r\n\r\nFrom 1801 dates the great advance in modern methods, ideas and\r\naccomplishment. It then occupied forty days to get a letter from\r\nPortland, Me., to Savannah, Ga., and bring back an answer, and\r\nforty-four at Philadelphia for a reply to one addressed to Nashville,\r\nTenn. Ten years later the time had been reduced to twenty-seven and\r\nthirty days. By 1810 there were over 2,400 post offices and the post\r\nroutes covered over 37,000 miles. Marked improvements began soon after\r\nthis period. The office of Second Assistant Postmaster General was\r\ncreated and the scale of postages changed. Single letters of one piece\r\nwere charged from 8 to 25 cents, according to distance. Sunday delivery\r\nof mail at post offices was inaugurated about that time in the face of\r\ngreat objection from the religious bodies of the country, the strife\r\nbeing kept up for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the mails were first conveyed in steamboats from one port\r\ntown to another, the Government paying 3 cents for each letter and 1\r\ncent for newspapers. The postal laws of 1816 made a further change\r\nin postage which lasted until 1845. The new scale charged letters\r\nconsisting of one piece of paper, not going over 30 miles, 6 cents; not\r\nover 80 miles, 10 cents; not over 150 miles, 12½ cents, and not over\r\n400 miles, 18¾ cents, and for greater distances, 25 cents. On the ninth\r\nof March, 1829, Hon. William T. Barry, of Kentucky, was commissioned\r\nPostmaster General by President Jackson, and called to a seat in his\r\nCabinet, being the first Postmaster General to receive that honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostage Stamps Introduced\r\n\r\nEarly in 1836, pony expresses as they were called, were put into\r\noperation on the principal turnpike roads of the Southern and Western\r\nStates for the purpose of carrying letters of persons desiring\r\ngreater expedition, press news and Government dispatches, at triple\r\nthe ordinary rates, but the experiment was abandoned, not proving\r\nprofitable. In July, 1838, the Department was reorganized and an\r\nAuditor appointed. The office of Third Assistant Postmaster General\r\nwas also created at that time. Railroads were declared post routes\r\nby act of Congress, in July, 1838, and the mails carried upon them.\r\nPostage stamps of the five-and ten-cent denominations with the faces\r\nof Franklin and Washington, respectively, were introduced in 1847.\r\nPreviously all postages were collected entirely in money, prepayment\r\nbeing optional. July, 1851, a new series of stamps was adopted,\r\nconsisting at first of denominations of 1 and 3 cents, but afterwards\r\nof larger amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressive Steps Taken\r\n\r\nRapidly sketched for reference, the more important progressive steps\r\nthat followed show that during the administration of President\r\nTyler, while Hon. Charles A. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, was Postmaster\r\nGeneral, many reforms were instituted, such as cheapening the postage,\r\nimproving the manner of letting routes by contract, prohibiting\r\nprivate expresses, and restricting the franking privilege. Prior to\r\nthis period, letters were not rated by weight but by enclosures. For\r\ninstance, a letter containing three banknotes for which the single\r\nletter charge would be 18¾ cents for over 150 miles, was then charged\r\n75 cents, the inclosure making it a quadruple letter. Under the new\r\nsystem the rate was measured by the weight, all weighing not over\r\nhalf an ounce were regarded as single letters and carried for 5 cents\r\nfor distances not over 300 miles and 10 cents for greater distances.\r\nIn 1850 the “foreign desk,” from which ultimately grew the admirable\r\narrangement of the Postal Union, was instituted by Hon. Horatio King,\r\nof Maine. Through the efforts of Judge Hall, of New York, Postmaster\r\nGeneral under President Fillmore, the postage on letters was reduced\r\nto 3 cents. The registration system came in under Postmaster General\r\nCampbell, of Pennsylvania, during the administration of President\r\nPierce. The Free Delivery Service was inaugurated in 1863 by Hon.\r\nMontgomery Blair, of Maryland, also the money order system in 1864, in\r\nLincoln’s administration. The Railway Mail Service dates from July,\r\n1862, when Judge Holt, of Kentucky, ordered its establishment, the\r\nfirst railway postoffice being from Quincy, Ill., to St. Joseph, Mo.,\r\non the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Data\r\n\r\nA summary of historical data covering some of the principal features of\r\npostal progress may be given in chronological order as follows: Postage\r\nstamps first issued at New York, July, 1847; stamped envelopes first\r\nissued, June, 1853; letters registered, July, 1855; newspaper wrappers,\r\nAct of Congress, February, 1861; Free City Delivery, July, 1863; Money\r\nOrder System, November, 1864; International Money Orders, October,\r\n1867; Postal Cards, May, 1873; Postage reduced to 2 cents, October,\r\n1883; Special Delivery, October, 1885; Rural Delivery, October, 1896;\r\nPostal Savings, January, 1911; Parcel Post, January, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of post offices in the United States, 76,945, was\r\nreached in 1901, since which time by the introduction of rural delivery\r\nthe number has steadily declined, 21,011 having been discontinued.\r\nJuly, 1916, there were 55,934 in operation. Extent of post routes in\r\nmiles in 1790 was 1,875. In 1915 the number was 1,672,169. The miles\r\nof service performed in 1915 amounted to 617,527,795. The entire\r\ncompensation paid to postmasters in 1789 was $1,657. In 1916 the\r\nestimated amount was $31,150,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nQuestions of Finance\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Revenue--How Derived\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Post Office Department are derived from sales\r\nof stamps, stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers and postal cards,\r\nsecond-class postage (pound rate) paid in money, box rents, money\r\norder business, balances due from foreign postal administrations,\r\nmiscellaneous receipts, fines and penalties, and from unclaimed dead\r\nletters and postal matter. Its greatest revenue is received from\r\npostage paid on mail matter. The amount so received in the last fiscal\r\nyear was $287,001,495.13, or 91.97 per cent of the total revenue\r\nreceived. Of this amount $20,174,973.93 was received from mailings of\r\nsecond, third and fourth-class mail matter on which the postage was\r\ncollected in money, the remainder, $266,826,521.20, being the postage\r\npaid by means of stamps. Entire revenue, 1916, $312,057,688.83.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenues and Expenditures\r\n\r\nThe audited revenues and expenditures of the Post Office Department\r\nfor the year 1916, show that the ordinary postal revenue yielded\r\n$303,232,143.36; revenue from money order business $8,130,545.47,\r\nand from postal savings business $695,000. Total revenue received,\r\n$312,057,688.83. Expenditures: On account of the current year, 1916,\r\n$297,637,128.87. On account of previous years, $8,566,904.27. Total\r\nexpenditure during the fiscal year 1916, $306,204,033.14. Excess of\r\nrevenue over expenditure, 1916, $5,853,565.69. Amount of losses by\r\nfire, burglary, etc., $24,419.62. Surplus in postal revenue for fiscal\r\nyear 1916, $5,829,236.07.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of Expenditure\r\n\r\nExpenses of the postal service are paid as follows:\r\n\r\n_By Postmasters._--Postmasters are authorized to pay their own\r\nsalaries, the salaries of clerks and carriers attached to their\r\noffices, rent, light, and fuel, and other expenses of their offices\r\nfrom postal receipts.\r\n\r\n_By Warrants Drawn upon the Treasurer of the United States._--These\r\nwarrants are in payment of the contracts for transportation of\r\nmail, supplies, and other obligations that cannot be paid direct by\r\npostmasters. The accounts are prepared for payment by journals in\r\nthe Bureau of the Post Office Department having jurisdiction over the\r\nappropriations and certified to the Auditor, who reviews them and\r\nforwards the journals to the Division of Finance. Warrants are then\r\ndrawn for the amounts due to contractors, countersigned by the Auditor\r\nand mailed direct from the Department to the payees.\r\n\r\n_By Disbursing Postmasters._--Certain payments may be authorized\r\nby the Postmaster General to be made by postmasters designated as\r\ndisbursing officers. The Department authorizes and directs disbursing\r\npostmasters, one in each State, to pay the monthly salaries of rural\r\ndelivery carriers. In addition thereto the Department authorizes other\r\npostmasters who are designated as disbursing officers, to pay the\r\nsalaries of railway mail clerks, and in some instances the salaries of\r\npostoffice inspectors and other employes of the postal service. When\r\nthe receipts of an office are not sufficient to meet the pay rolls\r\nauthorized by the Department, the postmaster is instructed to make an\r\nestimate of the deficiency and forward a requisition to the Postmaster\r\nGeneral therefor. An accountable warrant drawn on the Treasurer of the\r\nUnited States for the sum needed is then forwarded to the postmaster\r\nwho deposits the same in a depository bank and issues his check in\r\npayment of such salaries.\r\n\r\n_By Transfer Draft._--If a balance appears to be due a postmaster after\r\nhis term of office has expired and his accounts have been adjusted, the\r\nAuditor certifies the amount due and upon this certification a transfer\r\ndraft issued by the Department and drawn on a postmaster in the State\r\nin which the former postmaster resides, is forwarded in settlement of\r\nthe account.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Appropriations Are Made for the Department\r\n\r\nAppropriations for the Post Office Department are made by the Congress\r\nupon estimates submitted to the Postmaster General by the heads of the\r\nvarious bureaus according to the nature and needs of the service. After\r\nexamination and approval by the Postmaster General, these estimates\r\nare sent to the Secretary of the Treasury where the estimates for\r\nall Departments of the Government are assembled for transmission to\r\nCongress. Hearings on the estimates submitted by the Postmaster General\r\nare then held by the House Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads,\r\nthe members of which go over the items in detail, the various bureau\r\nheads being in attendance to explain more fully, if need be, the public\r\nnecessity and requirements of the estimates submitted. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral may also be called upon to explain these estimates if the\r\nCommittee so desire. At the conclusion of these hearings, the result\r\nof such inquiry and the recommendations of the Post Office Committee\r\nare submitted to Congress and are considered in Committee of the Whole.\r\nWhen the post office bill is under consideration and upon its passage\r\nthrough the House of Representatives it is in charge of the Chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, who answers all inquires\r\nmade and defends the action of his committee in submitting these\r\nestimates to Congress for its action and approval.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuditor for the Post Office Department\r\n\r\nAll accounts of the Post Office Department are audited by the Sixth\r\nAuditor of the Treasury, who is the Auditor for the Department. When\r\nthe Department was reorganized in 1836 this position was created for\r\nthe purpose of relieving the Postmaster General of the responsibilities\r\nof this particular form of official duty. The statutes define these\r\nduties which are numerous and important, the fiscal relations, owing\r\nto the great growth of the postal service, being of such magnitude\r\nand involving such an amount of detail that the office has become one\r\nof the greatest of the auditing branches of the Treasury Department.\r\nThe annual reports of the Auditor to the Postmaster General show the\r\nfinancial condition of the Department at the close of each fiscal year\r\nand are a part of the Postmaster General’s report to Congress. A very\r\nlarge force of clerks is required to conduct the operations of the\r\noffice and the most approved devices and methods are used to facilitate\r\nthe dispatch of business. For greater convenience the office of the\r\nAuditor is lodged with the Post Office Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDepartment Operations--General and Detailed Descriptions and Cost of\r\nService\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Rural Free Delivery\r\n\r\nThe subject of Rural Free Delivery occupies so much public attention\r\nboth in the press and among the people, and the Department has shown\r\nsuch interest in the matter and done so much to make the service\r\npopular and attractive as a public measure, that it is worthy of some\r\nconsiderable space in a work devoted entirely to postal affairs. Aside\r\nfrom tabular work which has no proper place in descriptive accounts of\r\ndepartmental operations, a very good idea of what rural delivery is and\r\naims to accomplish, may be gathered from the articles which follow this\r\nintroductory reference.\r\n\r\nThe history of Rural Delivery dates from January 5, 1892, when Hon.\r\nJames O’Donnell, Member of Congress from Michigan, introduced the\r\nfirst bill in Congress relating to the subject. This bill carried an\r\nappropriation of $6,000 but failed of passage. March 3, 1893, Congress\r\nappropriated $10,000 for experimental purposes but this sum together\r\nwith $20,000 appropriated July 16, 1894, for the same purpose, was\r\nnot used, Postmaster General W. S. Bissell, of New York, deeming the\r\namount insufficient. On June 9, 1896, $10,000 together with the prior\r\nappropriation of $30,000 was made available, and experimental rural\r\nfree delivery service was established by Postmaster General Wilson, of\r\nWest Virginia, on October 1, 1896, simultaneously, on three routes in\r\nthat State--Charlestown, Uvilla and Halltown.\r\n\r\nAt the close of business June 30, 1916, there were 42,927 rural routes\r\nin operation, 42,766 carriers covering 1,083,070 miles and serving\r\n5,719,062 families, representing a total population of 26,307,686, and\r\nat the cost of $51,715,616. Aggregate daily travel by rural carriers,\r\n1,063,305 miles. Average length of rural routes, 24.96 miles. The first\r\ncomplete county service was in Carroll County, Maryland. Available\r\nreports show that between the years 1905 and 1909, delivery of mail\r\non rural routes increased 87 per cent. In 1913, 2,745,319,372 pieces\r\nof mail were delivered; in 1915, 3,193,326,480; 1916, 3,022,755,601.\r\nCost of delivery per patron: 1915, $2.060; 1916, $1.966. Average annual\r\npay of carriers was $1,162.50, including motor vehicle service. For\r\nhorse-drawn routes the average was $1,155.48.\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Delivery Defined\r\n\r\nThe doubts, uncertainties and the delicate questions involved in\r\nthe early days of rural delivery when the subject was viewed with\r\nconcern, cautiously tested as an experiment and its extension in\r\nvarious directions regarded as perhaps outside the bounds of original\r\nintent and therefore to be approached with considerable reserve, is\r\nwell illustrated when petitions from Utah and other mining sections\r\nof the West for the establishment of such service to supply isolated\r\ncommunities devoted exclusively to mining, raised the question in the\r\nadministration of Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith as to the\r\nproper definition of rural free delivery. It was held by the First\r\nAssistant Postmaster General that the term “rural” meant communities\r\nnot included in cities or incorporated villages, and that it did not\r\nnecessarily imply that the persons so situated should be engaged in\r\nfarming pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Struggle for Rural Free Delivery\r\n\r\nThe aim and purpose of rural delivery was to place the rural resident\r\non something like equal grounds with the dweller in the cities so far\r\nas mail facilities were concerned, not exactly so, for conditions\r\nwere dissimilar, but to such reasonable extent as circumstances would\r\npermit. For years there had been a growing discontent among farmers\r\nand the people in the smaller towns and villages because of the postal\r\nadvantages afforded to the cities, and the more populous communities.\r\nThey felt themselves deprived of opportunities and benefits which\r\nothers enjoyed and could not understand why the accident of location\r\nshould make such a difference. Postal service was intended for all the\r\npeople, not a part, not merely for those who had chosen to live in\r\ncities but for those outside as well. This desire to share at least in\r\nthe benefits so freely accorded to others became at length so outspoken\r\nand insistent that recognition could no longer be denied and the matter\r\nwas finally introduced into Congress and an attempt made to secure\r\nlegislation upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe magnified difficulties of such a proposition as rural delivery\r\ncontemplated had long deterred action, and when the attempt was finally\r\nmade, the question was viewed with such caution and approached with\r\nsuch hesitation and the apprehension of an unknown and indeterminate\r\nexpense so bound up with possible failure of real benefit in proportion\r\nto cost, that postal authorities hesitated to take the initial step.\r\nEven when a sum of money was appropriated the task seemed too great\r\nfor successful accomplishment, and it was only when further delay was\r\nvigorously opposed that the step was taken. Congress voted $40,000 to\r\nmake the experiment and with that to begin with active measures were\r\ntaken and the rest is postal history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Advantages of Rural Delivery\r\n\r\nThe question has frequently been asked to what extent and in what way\r\nhas rural delivery service benefited the country sections of the United\r\nStates. Many magazine articles have been written to show the general\r\nadvantages it affords in rendering rural conditions more tolerable\r\nand enduring the inconveniences to which such life is subject. In one\r\nparticular at least, it has been of immense advantage and that alone\r\nhas secured it great public favor. It has given the farmer his daily\r\npaper. This great educator of our modern civilization, an almost\r\nindispensable necessity of our times, was practically denied the rural\r\nresident before the advent of this service, but now the avenues of\r\ncommunication are so far-reaching and the service so well conducted,\r\nthat publishers of daily papers have not only been able to greatly\r\nextend their circulation in every direction, but actually to bring the\r\nmorning newspaper to the farmer’s door at an hour which places him on\r\nan equal footing with his city neighbor in all the advantages which\r\nearly news can give, but which is of special advantage to the farmer\r\nwho has something to sell and is thus directed to the best market for\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\nThe combined opportunity which both publisher and subscriber now enjoy\r\nin country sections reached by rural delivery and the use made of it\r\nis forcibly illustrated in a recent statement published in a South\r\nDakota paper. A rural carrier stated that when he started service some\r\nyears ago there were but three farmers on his two routes who took daily\r\npapers. There are now something like 200 dailies taken by patrons on\r\nthese routes, some farmers subscribing for two or three.\r\n\r\nWhat rural delivery has done in other directions may be summed up\r\nas follows: It has broadened the field of industrial opportunity,\r\ntouched as if with magic power the possibilities of human endeavor,\r\nand transformed conditions to a degree almost marvelous. It has\r\nbrought special delivery almost to the door; secured good roads and\r\nmaintains them by official interest and concern; has attracted the\r\nattention of the various States to this question and obtained results;\r\nit has made farm lands more valuable and contributed to increased\r\nproduction; it has abridged time by rapid communication; brightened all\r\nenvironment, and made ordinary dull routine interesting and attractive;\r\nit has lessened toil by the instructive suggestions which Government\r\nexperiment and inquiry affords, and has made the home a center of\r\ninfluence and crowns domestic life with all that makes for peace and\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Delivery as Viewed by President McKinley\r\n\r\nThe favorable opinion entertained of the advantages of the rural free\r\ndelivery service when it was yet in the experimental stage and doubts\r\nwere expressed as to its practical benefit, cost considered, is well\r\nset forth by President McKinley in his annual message to Congress,\r\nDecember 3, 1900.\r\n\r\n “This service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces to good\r\n roads and quickens and extends the dissemination of general information.\r\n Experience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension that it would\r\n be so expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make it a serious\r\n burden. Its actual application has shown that it increases postal\r\n receipts, and can be accompanied by reductions in other branches of\r\n the service, so that augmented revenues and the accomplished savings\r\n together materially reduce the net cost.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First County Rural Service\r\n\r\nThe first full county service was inaugurated in Carroll County,\r\nMaryland, and at a time when weather conditions made it something of\r\nan undertaking. December 20, 1899, was the date selected and winter\r\nwith its storms and snow had put the roads in the worst possible\r\ncondition. Sixty-three post offices and thirty-five services by star\r\nroute contractors, were discontinued in one day and rural free delivery\r\nservice substituted. Westminster, then a third-class office, was\r\nmade the distributing center but postal stations were established in\r\nvillages where post offices had formerly been located.\r\n\r\nService started with four two-horse postal wagons and with a postal\r\nclerk in each to issue money orders, register letters and cancel stamps\r\non the letter mail collected. These wagons supplied mail to twenty\r\nrural carriers at designated points and brought all the territory\r\nwithin easy and convenient reach. This initial service first covered\r\n387 square miles of the 453 in the county, but soon afterward embraced\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of so great a change in postal service created\r\nantagonism and a strong delegation came to Washington to enter protest.\r\nBut the manifest advantages which soon began to appear, silenced all\r\nopposition, and the great majority of the protesting citizens withdrew\r\ntheir opposition and bore convincing testimony to the efficiency and\r\nvalue of the service. The cost of the service in the first three months\r\nwas $4,543, saving by service superseded, $2,805. Increase of postal\r\nreceipts was $1,501.75 leaving net cost of the whole county service for\r\nthree months at only $236.\r\n\r\nThis successful county experiment attracted wide attention and full\r\ncounty service was thereafter rapidly established in many directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry-wide Extension, Rural Delivery\r\n\r\nThe extension of rural delivery has increased from year to year and the\r\ncost of the service has grown in corresponding proportion. The great\r\nnext step would be country-wide extension, which has been frequently\r\nmentioned on account of the vast possibilities bound up in such a\r\nmeasure. This would, however, involve a very considerable expense. It\r\nis estimated that to extend this service to all rural patrons wherever\r\nlocated would cost something like $100,000,000 more. While such\r\ncomplete service is the logical conclusion of all rural delivery effort\r\nand may be expected to engage public attention in the near future, as\r\nit is the only means left by which the thousands of people now deprived\r\nof such benefits can be reached and accommodated, such a tremendous\r\nadvance must be seriously considered before any definite steps can\r\nbe taken, but rural delivery will never reach the point of greatest\r\nusefulness until this country-wide extension is an accomplished fact\r\nand people everywhere are permitted to equally enjoy the benefit which\r\nit confers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Rural Delivery Enhances the Value of Farm Land\r\n\r\nMany arguments have been advanced by the friends of rural delivery\r\nto show the almost immeasurable value of this service to the farming\r\ncommunities of the nation, but there is one case which has come under\r\nthe notice of the publisher which presents an argument of such striking\r\nforce that it is worthy of special mention.\r\n\r\nMr. Marion F. Holderman, of Washington, D. C., states that in 1885 he\r\nbought 135 acres of farming land three miles east of Rantoul, Ill., in\r\nChampaign County, for $44 per acre, and that in 1901 rural delivery\r\nwas established enabling the delivery of the Chicago daily papers at\r\nhis gate in the morning, thus giving him all the advantages of the\r\nChicago market and the opportunity of the shipment of grain, stock,\r\nand farm products the same day that these published market reports\r\nappeared. This fact so greatly enhanced the value of the land through\r\nthese succeeding years that he was able to sell this property for\r\n$225 per acre on March 1, 1917, thus netting him a profit of $24,435.\r\nNo improvements were made on the farm except necessary repairs and\r\npainting of the buildings.\r\n\r\nHe states that if there had not been rural delivery he would have had\r\nto go to the post office for his mail at least twice a week which at\r\nthe lowest estimate for the time of the person, vehicle, and the horses\r\nwould have cost him over $225 per annum, and as there are 105 families\r\non the route besides himself, the saving to the patrons of the route by\r\nthis service is over $23,850 annually, besides the value of the land\r\nincrease, and the many other advantages which have followed.\r\n\r\nTaking his estimate of saving to each family along a route and allowing\r\nfor six families for each mile, three on each side of the road, and\r\nthere being 1,037,259 miles of rural delivery roads in the United\r\nStates, it can be seen what an aggregate wonderful saving this has\r\nmade, not counting the property, personal and educational value of such\r\na service to the people.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that by this showing that the saving to the patrons of\r\n1 mile of rural delivery service ($1,350) will more than pay what it\r\ncosts the Government for a 24-mile route at a rate of $1,200 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Per Capita Cost in Rural Delivery\r\n\r\nThe per capita cost in the Rural Delivery Service has been a matter\r\nof considerable interest to those who are following the progress and\r\nextension of this branch of the public service. The great advance which\r\nhas been made in this service and the still greater extent to which it\r\nis proposed to extend it, embracing ultimately all patrons wherever\r\nlocated, naturally raises the question of cost as a whole and the cost\r\nper patron.\r\n\r\nCharles Emory Smith, Postmaster General in 1900, who was one of the\r\nstaunch friends of rural delivery in its early days, said the gross\r\ncost could be estimated by three methods, cost per square mile, cost\r\nper capita, and cost per county. Adhering to the subject in hand it may\r\nbe stated that he found the cost per capita at that time to be 92.7\r\nserving a population of about 2,000,000 people on something less than\r\n3,000 routes. There is no reliable data covering the period to 1910\r\nupon this subject, but taking an estimate based upon close calculation,\r\nit is found that notwithstanding the tremendous growth of this service\r\nduring that time reaching in 1910 over 41,000 routes and accommodating\r\nover 20,000,000 patrons, the cost per capita had arisen to only 1.797,\r\nand now with nearly 43,000 routes and serving over 26,000,000 people\r\nas patrons, the cost per capita is but 1.966. No answer as to cost\r\nconsidering the known value of such service could be illustrated more\r\nforcibly than by the figures here presented. If the undeniable benefits\r\nof rural service to the people can be given with ever-increasing\r\nefficiency at a cost no greater than that, it can be reasonably assumed\r\nthat the people who live upon the farms of the United States and endure\r\nthe hardships of such life with its many attendant inconveniences are\r\ncertainly entitled to their share of public benefit, especially when\r\nas shown, the cost is so small compared to the inmeasurable advantages\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\nThe city delivery service of the nation with its 34,000 carriers\r\ncosts now over $43,000,000. No computation of cost per capita in this\r\nservice has ever been made and relative comparison cannot be given\r\nbut such figures as are available show that in 1911 the per capita\r\ncost of serving the people in the cities of the country was $1.40 and\r\nthat in 1916 this cost had increased to $1.75. When the comparatively\r\ncomfortable conditions under which city delivery is conducted is\r\nconsidered, and the proportionate difference in appropriation taken\r\ninto account, it will appear that the excess of cost in rural delivery\r\nis no greater than might naturally be expected from the peculiar\r\nnature of the service, the territory to be covered, and the almost\r\ninsurmountable conditions with which it has to contend. Indeed, it is\r\na matter of surprise that the cost of service per capita under the\r\ncircumstances is so small.\r\n\r\nTo keep down the public expense to so low a figure while extending this\r\nservice to millions of people heretofore denied this privilege, should\r\nbe a matter of congratulation and encourage the hope, as well as assure\r\nthe ultimate end towards which all rural delivery aims and activities\r\nare directed, viz., country-wide extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Necessary Conditions of Rural Delivery\r\n\r\nEngland, France and Germany antedate us in the establishment of rural\r\ndelivery, but the service there is bureaucratic, originating always\r\nwith the post office officials and dominated by red tape requirements.\r\nOurs is democratic and cooperative. It is established upon petitions\r\nsent through Representatives in Congress, irrespective of party\r\naffiliation. However, any application received from a postmaster, or\r\nindividual, showing reasonable warrant for the establishment of a rural\r\nroute in any community will be given careful consideration by the\r\nDepartment. It is absolutely free, the only conditions the Government\r\nmakes in establishing and maintaining service is that those who desire\r\nto avail themselves of its beneficent provisions shall do their part\r\ntowards rendering it of public advantage, viz., by mending their roads,\r\nbuilding bridges over unbridged creeks and streams, see that the\r\ncounty commissioners give prompt attention to such needs and provide\r\nthemselves with suitable receiving boxes, conveniently placed along the\r\nroadside that the carrier can readily deposit and collect mail without\r\nalighting from his conveyance. Patrons can do much towards aiding the\r\nGovernment in this matter and they doubtless do their bit in a willing\r\nand accommodating spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Cost Per Patron, and Pieces Handled in Rural Delivery Service\r\n\r\nA study of the annual cost per patron in the rural delivery service\r\nfor the year 1916, shows that in the States of California and Utah,\r\nand in the District of Columbia, it was less than $1 each. In the\r\nStates of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,\r\nFlorida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,\r\nMississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode\r\nIsland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West\r\nVirginia, it was more than $1 and less than $2. In Illinois, Indiana,\r\nIowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,\r\nNevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont,\r\nWisconsin and Wyoming, it was more than $2 and less than $3, and in\r\nNorth and South Dakota it was over $3 and less than $4. Annual cost of\r\nservice for patron decreased from 2,066 in 1915 to 1,966 in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe annual cost per piece of mail handled on rural routes was lowest in\r\nthe States of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Utah, and the District of Columbia, and highest in Arkansas,\r\nFlorida, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee. Annual\r\ncost per price handled was .0144 in 1915 and .0150 in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe States which had the largest number of patrons served on rural\r\nroutes (over a million in each) were Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,\r\nMichigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nTennessee, and Texas. The States which had less than 100,000 patrons\r\nserved were Arizona, Delaware, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode\r\nIsland, Utah, Wyoming and the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation and Extension of Rural Service\r\n\r\nRelative to the provision in the act making appropriations for the\r\nrural service for the fiscal year 1917, “that rural mail delivery\r\nshall be extended so as to serve as nearly as practicable the entire\r\nrural population of the United States,” it should be stated that rural\r\ndelivery service covered, at the end of the fiscal year 1916, 1,037,259\r\nmiles of roads, while star-route service was operated upon 139,634\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are 2,199,646 miles of public roads in the\r\nUnited States, so that there remain 1,022,753 miles or roads on which\r\nno mail service is in operation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fiscal year 1916 an estimated population of\r\n26,307,686 was served by rural routes, 520,000 by star routes, and\r\napproximately 10,000,000 by fourth-class post offices. The total rural\r\npopulation in the United States is placed at 43,991,722. It will be\r\nseen, therefore, that while 83 per cent of the rural population is\r\nreceiving convenient mail service, 47 per cent of the rural road\r\nmileage is uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeeding Up the Rural Service by Motor Vehicle\r\n\r\nThis is a time of intense activity. Action is demanded everywhere and\r\n“get there” is the cry of the day. Brevity and speed are in close\r\nfellowship in the business world and competition spurs on towards\r\nthe greatest possible endeavor in any direction where advantage\r\nlies. Expedients no longer serve. Only that which is best and in the\r\nhighest degree efficient, can hope to survive. The introduction of the\r\nmotor car in transforming conditions and producing wonderful changes\r\nis characteristic of this pushing age. Time is money. The motor has\r\ndemonstrated its value, and dominates the field of all far-reaching\r\nenterprise. Business men recognize its tremendous possibilities\r\nand advantageous help in saving time and abridging distance. It\r\nspells efficiency in commercial life and men strain a point to\r\nbring themselves up alongside their pushing and wideawake neighbors\r\nin availing themselves of this great modern aid to the completest\r\nequipment. The farmer realizing what it can accomplish in his peculiar\r\ndomain, has hastened to supply himself with what will contribute to\r\nhis profit, and he finds in this great adjunct to energetic industrial\r\nlife the means of increasing his business and enlarging his vision of\r\nopportunity and desire.\r\n\r\nMotor vehicle service is of course an innovation upon the 24-mile\r\nhorse-drawn route, and as any innovation upon old-established custom\r\nmay expect to meet objection in the administration of public affairs,\r\nespecially when such an innovation contemplates a readjustment of\r\nroutes and a possible reduction of carriers, objection was raised in\r\nsome quarters, but the desire to secure all the benefit which the\r\nparcel post could give by the opportunity afforded by zone extension,\r\nwas a determining factor in the case, and the Postmaster General,\r\navailing himself of the power vested in him by act of Congress,\r\nordered its establishment, due regard being had to the limitations and\r\nconditions under which it could be operated. Experience has justified\r\nthe wisdom of such action. Motor vehicles were accordingly introduced\r\ninto the rural service in 1915 to meet this demand for greater\r\nexpedition in service and the transportation of increased amounts of\r\nparcel post and mail matter on extended routes and principally from\r\nthe larger cities. These routes must, however, be 50 miles in length\r\nand the compensation is fixed at not more than $1,800 per annum, the\r\ncarriers to furnish and maintain their own motor vehicles. On June\r\n30, 1916, 500 of such routes were in operation with a total length of\r\n26,878 miles, averaging 53.756 miles per route, with an annual cost\r\nof $877,824, or an average of $1,755.65 per route. These motor routes\r\nsuperseded horse-drawn vehicle service formerly costing $1,093,106 a\r\nyear, or an annual saving of $515,282. Motor routes are of especial\r\nbenefit in sections where railroad facilities are lacking. The greater\r\ndistance covered by motor routes makes it possible for a much larger\r\nnumber of persons in given localities to communicate with one another\r\non the same day, eliminating the necessity for taking the mail to\r\npostoffices for redispatch and in some instances transshipment over\r\none or more railroads. Better facilities are also afforded for the\r\ntransportation of products of the farm. Indianapolis, Ind., is a\r\nconspicuous example of the efficiency of this service in reducing\r\npostage; a 20-pound package mailed on a rural route from one office\r\nin Marion County addressed to a patron of a rural route on another,\r\nwhich would have cost 24 cents, can now be carried for 15 cents, and\r\na 50-pound package from one point to another, the cost of which would\r\nhave been 54 cents will now cost but 30 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nVillage Delivery\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the desire of the Government to do everything in its\r\npower to oblige and accommodate the people of the country and enlarge\r\nevery privilege which could advance their interests or provide for\r\ntheir comfort, the question of the extension of village delivery, for\r\nwhich there has been considerable demand, but which has heretofore\r\nreceived little encouragement, was taken up with a view of securing\r\nsuch action from Congress as would allow further extensions to be made,\r\nthe original appropriation being too limited for the purpose.\r\n\r\nBetween the very great facilities afforded the dwellers in the cities\r\nand the almost equally great accommodation shown to those in the rural\r\nsections, village delivery was but imperfectly considered and the\r\nbenefits and advantages which a more direct attention to these needs\r\ncould have secured, was allowed to remain in abeyance, or at least not\r\ngiven the attention it deserved.\r\n\r\nBut the claim of the residents of small towns to equal privileges with\r\nmore favored localities was at length recognized and village delivery\r\nwhich was established and put into operation in 1912, was extended\r\nuntil 280 of such towns now have this accommodation, employing 400\r\ncarriers. The entrance salary paid village delivery carriers is at the\r\nrate of $600 per annum, and increased to $690 per annum after twelve\r\nmonths of satisfactory service. Only communities where the annual post\r\noffice receipts amount to $5,000 are entitled to this service.\r\n\r\nCarriers appointed at third class offices are not subject to civil\r\nservice rules as such offices are not classified. When the receipts\r\namount to $8,000 per annum, the office is advanced to second class and\r\nthe village delivery carriers are given a civil service status.\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Delivery\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the number of city delivery offices was 66, number of carriers\r\n685, cost of service, 1864, $317,063.20. In 1916 the number of\r\noffices was 1,864, number of carriers 34,114, and the cost of service\r\n$43,136,818. Average annual salaries of carriers for the past four\r\nyears has increased from $1,080.22, to $1,115.46. Carriers enter the\r\nservice at a salary of $800 per annum and are promoted annually on\r\ntheir service record through the various grades until they reach the\r\nsalary of $1,100 at first class offices, and $1,000 at offices of the\r\nsecond class, after which promotion depends upon their exceptional\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nStar Routes\r\n\r\nJune 30, 1916, the number of star routes was 11,187, length in miles,\r\n147,167, average cost per mile of length of routes $54.16, per mile of\r\ntravel $0.1026. In the renewal of contracts on certain routes in the\r\nwestern States under new form of advertisement there was a reduction in\r\nthe cost of operation of $130,000.\r\n\r\nStar routes are so-called because originally, a “star” appeared on the\r\nadvertisements for contract bidding to distinguish them from other\r\ncontracts and because of the words “with due celerity, certainty and\r\nsecurity” which appeared in connection with such contract service. The\r\npurpose of star route service is to serve post offices off the line\r\nof railroad travel and incidentally such families as may live between\r\nthose post offices who erect boxes or hang out satchels to receive\r\ntheir mail, also to collect mail where proper provision has been made\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nNo bid submitted under an advertisement for star route service will be\r\nconsidered unless the bidder shall agree in his bid that in the event\r\nof the contract being awarded to him he will reside on or contiguous to\r\nthe route and give his personal supervision to the performance of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Savings\r\n\r\nThe postal savings system was inaugurated January 3, 1911. In June,\r\n1916, the number of depositors was 602,937 and the balance to the\r\ncredit of depositors was $86,019,885.00. The denominations of postal\r\nnotes or certificates are $5.00, $10.00, $20.00, $50.00 and $100.00,\r\nand they may be purchased at any postal depository. The interest\r\nallowed by the Government is 2 per cent. These deposits may be\r\nexchanged in amounts of $20.00 and multiples thereof, for 2½ per cent\r\nU. S. Postal Savings, registered or coupon bonds. Postal certificates\r\nare made at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney Order System\r\n\r\nDr. Charles F. Macdonald, who had been greatly interested and had taken\r\nan active part in the establishment of the money order system, was\r\nupon its inauguration in May, 1864, appointed as superintendent. He\r\nis often called the “father of the money order system” and doubtless\r\nwith some considerable justice. He labored untiringly to make it a\r\nsuccess, and upon his death in 1902 it was found that he had bequeathed\r\n$2,000 to the United States to be used by the Postmaster General in\r\nthe improvement of that service, and Congress by act of October 22,\r\n1913, accepted the gift, and the commission appointed by the Postmaster\r\nGeneral in furtherance of the act recommended that a vignette of Dr.\r\nMacdonald be placed on the money order draft forms. This recommendation\r\nwas approved by the Postmaster General and carried into effect. Orders\r\nissued: 1916, 121,636,818. Amount, $719,364,950.46. Orders paid and\r\nrepaid: number, 122,379,113. Amount, $720,584,719.58. Net money order\r\nrevenue for 1916, $6,821,499.75.\r\n\r\n\r\nStamp Books\r\n\r\nThe need for some convenient way of handling postage stamps when\r\nmore were purchased than immediately required and which need was\r\nlong felt and operated as a bar against the purchase of stamps in\r\nany considerable quantity for occasional use, led the Hon. Edwin C.\r\nMadden, Third Assistant Postmaster General, to consider some method\r\nof remedying this lack, and on March 26, 1900, after considerable\r\nexperiment with paper of various kinds to suit the purpose, devised\r\nthe stamp book now in use of which millions of copies are annually\r\nsold. In 1916, the Department issued 28,005,930 of these books and\r\nthe demand for them is constantly increasing. These books are made in\r\nsix different kinds--books containing 24 and 96 stamps of the 1-cent\r\ndenomination; 12, 24 and 48, of the 2-cent denomination, and a book\r\ncontaining both 1-cent and 2-cent stamps, viz., 24 1-cent, and 24\r\n2-cent.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be but just to divide the credit of the\r\norigin of the stamp book with Captain Bain of the Bureau of Engraving\r\nand Printing, who, it is said, had the project in mind for some time\r\nprevious to its inauguration as a public accommodation. Mr. Madden\r\nis usually given the credit but, as stated, the credit may perhaps\r\nbe fairly divided, as it is understood that both these gentlemen\r\ncollaborated in the perfection of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Cards\r\n\r\nThe postal cards now so generally used at once sprang into public favor\r\nwhen adopted in this country in 1873. Their use has not only been a\r\nmeans of carrying intelligence in easy and convenient form, but has\r\ncontributed to commercial enterprise in many forms, and many directions\r\nas the growing demand for them in the business world amply indicates.\r\nThe number issued to postmasters in 1916 was 1,047,894,800 and the\r\nvalue of these cards was $10,784,307.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Stamps\r\n\r\n  Postage stamps and other stamped paper\r\n    on hand in post offices, July 1, 1915     $104,035,823.48\r\n  Stamped paper charged to postmasters         287,352,176.84\r\n  Sales by postmasters, July 1, 1915, to\r\n    June 30, 1916                              277,728,025.20\r\n  Stamped paper on hand in post offices,\r\n    June 30, 1916                              112,332,714.66\r\n\r\nThe reduction in stamp sales which followed the outbreak of the war in\r\nEurope and the gradual recovery is shown in the increases, viz., for\r\nthe quarter ending September 30, 1915, the percentage of increase was\r\n3.01; for December 31, 1915, it was 9.04; for March 31, 1916, it was\r\n9.87; for June 30, 1916, it was 11.25.\r\n\r\nInteresting information concerning the manufacture of stamps, etc., is\r\ngiven in the article relating to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing\r\non page 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Classification\r\n\r\nThis division is charged with the consideration of all questions\r\nrelating to the classification of matter admitted to the mails,\r\nintended or deposited for mailing, including the determination of the\r\nadmissibility of publications to the second class of mail matter,\r\nthe limit of weight and size of mail, penalty envelopes and the\r\nfranking privilege. This office is in the Bureau of the Third Assistant\r\nPostmaster General to whom all questions upon this and kindred subjects\r\nshould be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchasing Agent\r\n\r\nUnder the direction and control of the Postmaster General, this officer\r\nhas the supervision and purchase of all supplies for the Department,\r\nwhether under contract or not, for the Post Office Department proper or\r\nfor any branch of the postal service. The Postal Laws and Regulations\r\nprovide that a Bureau officer controlling an appropriation, may\r\nauthorize postmasters and other postal officials to purchase supplies\r\nchargeable to that appropriation subject to the approval of the\r\npurchasing agent in each instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dead Letter Office\r\n\r\nAll undeliverable mail matter comes within two classes, unmailable\r\nand unclaimed. The first comprises such as is not sufficiently\r\nprepaid or so incorrectly, insufficiently or illegibly addressed\r\nthat the destination could not be discovered. All letters of this\r\nclass containing matter of value is classified and recorded and a\r\nconsiderable amount of money can thus be returned to the owner. The\r\nlarger part of such unmailable matter contains articles of merchandise,\r\nphotographs, etc. The undeliverable letters are those that though\r\nproperly prepaid and correctly addressed are unclaimed, not taken out\r\nof the office, though effort had been made by advertisement to find the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nLetters and parcels received for 1916 amounted to 10,839,890. Of this\r\nnumber 3,677,194 pieces were delivered, 101,485 filed, 7,019,436\r\ndestroyed and 41,775 under treatment. Checks, drafts, money orders and\r\nother valuable papers of the face value of $2,303,119.56 were found\r\nin undelivered letters, practically all of which was restored to the\r\nowners. The net revenue from the sale of undeliverable articles of\r\nmerchandise and currency found loose in the mails, etc., aggregated\r\n$53,665.69. Advertised letters returned from the Dead Letter Office now\r\nrequire the payment of 1 cent, the revenue of this for the past six\r\nmonths amounted to $11,000, making net revenue $64,665.69, or within\r\n$10,000 of the whole amount required to conduct the operations of the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nFormerly all dead matter came to Washington for examination and\r\ndisposition. Now there are twelve large cities in the country\r\ngeographically arranged, to which dead matter is sent in addition to\r\nwhat is received in Washington. This has made it possible to largely\r\nreduce the force in the Washington office. The establishment of the\r\nDead Letter Office dates back to 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Locks\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of locks used by the Department, in protecting\r\nthe mails, the brass padlocks seen on letter and package boxes, the\r\niron lock used on mail pouches, the inside letter box lock, and the\r\nregistered lock used to protect the more valuable mail. The locks and\r\nkeys are made by the Government in the equipment shops at Washington.\r\nOf the iron lock there are something like a million in use. These locks\r\nare made at a cost of 8½ cents each and weigh but 2-4/5 ounces, the\r\nlightest and best lock ever used for the purpose. Locks previously\r\nin use cost a great deal more to make and keep in repair and were\r\nmuch heavier. The study of economy in various forms during the past\r\nfour years has made it possible to introduce many reforms in the\r\nmanufacture of locks of which the above is a significant example. Steel\r\nis now largely used in all lock equipment on account of the high cost\r\nof brass. All equipment used in mail transportation is made by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMail locks and keys were formerly made by contract, but during the\r\nadministration of Postmaster General Dickinson it was decided to do\r\nthis work under Government supervision. Public policy, no less than\r\neconomy dictated this course. While the manufacture of Government locks\r\nwas surrounded with all possible safeguard and precaution there could\r\nbe no absolute assurance that the mechanism would be kept secret, would\r\nbe safe from imitation, so the Government, both for security to the\r\nmails and for economic reasons, decided to have the work done under its\r\nown direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Pouches and Sacks\r\n\r\nIn the general scheme of mail bags used in the postal service the term\r\n“pouch” is used to apply to all mail bags designed for locking by\r\nmeans of mail locks, and the term “sack” is used to apply to all mail\r\nbags used in the postal service which are designed for closing but not\r\nlocking.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “pouch” may be mentioned those bags used for inclosing\r\nthrough registered mail, saddle bags, designed for transportation of\r\nmail on horseback; inner registered bags, used for holding registered\r\nmatter and inclosed in another receptacle; and the ordinary pouches for\r\nfirst class mail matter such as letters, etc.; also the mail catcher\r\npouch, the use of which is restricted to the exchange of mails with\r\nmoving trains.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “sacks,” which are designed for closing, as a rule, but\r\nnot locking, comes the ordinary sack for newspapers and parcel post\r\nmatter, and bearing a cord fastener which bears a label case and also\r\nserves for closure purposes. The standard bag is made of No. 8 canvas,\r\nof best quality, and withstands usage for several years. The sacks used\r\nfor foreign mails, ordinary and registered, are not provided with a\r\nclosure device but are tied with a string and secured with a lead seal,\r\nbut it is expected in the near future these classes of bags will be\r\nequipped with a locking contrivance.\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years the weight of pouches used for ordinary\r\nservice has been rapidly diminishing. The average weight of pouches in\r\n1907, largest size, was about 9 pounds 5 ounces each, while those now\r\nbeing introduced into the service weigh 2½ pounds each. This reduction\r\nin weight being due largely to the elimination of leather parts. Many\r\nold-style pouches are still in use, viz., made of a heavy canvas body,\r\nleather bottom and a light weight top; costing about $2.16 each; the\r\n“1908” pouch made of a heavy canvas bottom with leather band and a\r\nlighter weight canvas top and body, costing about $1.44 each. These\r\npouches are now being rapidly replaced with the all-canvas pouch\r\ncosting less than 70 cents each. Catcher pouch used in the exchange\r\nof mails on moving trains costs 80 cents each. Wherever possible, the\r\nDepartment has eliminated expensive leather and other parts in the\r\nproduction of its equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 600,000 pouches and 4,000,000 sacks available\r\nto the service at present. The all-canvas pouch which the Department\r\nnow furnishes costs between 69 and 70 cents, while the largest size\r\ndomestic standard sack cost a little less than 73 cents, smaller\r\nsizes in proportion. Pouches and sacks are purchased by contract but\r\nkept in repair by the Government. New pouches of new types are also\r\nmanufactured by the Government, nearly 80,000 being made in the Mail\r\nBag Repair Shop during the past year.\r\n\r\nThe principal movement of mails is from the east to the west, from the\r\ngreat commercial centers to the less densely populated districts. This\r\nebb and flow is natural in ordinary times, but is greatly increased\r\nboth in volume and quantity when the immensely stimulated holiday trade\r\nchanges conditions in all directions and calls for the exercise of\r\nadministrative ability in meeting extraordinary demands and supplying\r\nsuddenly developed needs. These conditions are met by a system of\r\ndistribution devised to meet just such needs, whereby congestion is\r\nrelieved at one point and pressing demands accommodated at another, the\r\nvarious mail bag depositories under capable management rendering such\r\nnecessary aid. The whole supply of bags has been handled as much as ten\r\ntimes in one year through these depositories without which the peculiar\r\nconditions of the service could not be met. Mountain carriers in the\r\nnorthwest require special pouches especially in the sections where snow\r\nshoes are needed. The carriers in Alaska with their dog-teams have also\r\nspecial makes of pouches and thus all conditions are met where peculiar\r\nneeds require it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost Office Supplies\r\n\r\nIn June, 1872, Congress authorized the establishment of a blank\r\nagency for the purpose of supplying the smaller post offices with\r\nblanks and stationery. The appropriation was $132,500. In 1883 the\r\nscope of this enactment was enlarged and the Department undertook\r\nthe tremendous task of supplying all the post offices of the country\r\nwith stationery and all the office equipment and appliances needed in\r\nthe conduct of public business. The amount of a recent appropriation\r\nfor the purpose was about two and a half million dollars. From this\r\nblank agency has grown the Division of Supplies, which furnishes all\r\nsupplies needed except mail bags, locks and keys, which come under the\r\nequipment branch, of which this division is a part. Supplies are sent\r\nto postmasters upon requisitions made out upon blank forms furnished\r\nfor the purpose. These requisitions are carefully revised by clerks and\r\nallowances made conformably to practice and customs. Money order and\r\npostal note requisitions are also handled in this division. Supplies\r\nare required in enormous quantities for public use. In twine alone the\r\nrequired amount for 1916 was 2,000,000 pounds, or 680,000 miles of it.\r\nInk 15,000 gallons. Facing slips more than a billion; pencils, pens,\r\nblanks, envelopes and paper in staggering amounts. The utmost economy\r\nis practiced in sending out these immense supplies that waste may be\r\nprevented and the money appropriated used to the best advantage. The\r\ncapable management of the Superintendent and those in charge of the\r\nDivision of Equipment and Supplies, has produced gratifying results\r\nin all directions and rendered service which has been recognized and\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Delivery\r\n\r\nSpecial delivery was authorized by Act of March 3, 1885, during the\r\nadministration of Postmaster General Vilas. Established October 1,\r\n1885. At first restricted to free delivery offices in towns of 4,000 or\r\nmore inhabitants. August 4, 1886, it was extended to all free delivery\r\noffices. Special delivery service is made to all persons within the\r\ncarrier limits of city delivery and to patrons of rural service who\r\nreside more than 1 mile from post offices, but within half a mile of\r\nrural routes. Deliveries are made at all first and second class post\r\noffices on Sundays and at other offices if open on Sunday, and at all\r\noffices on holidays. Auditor’s report shows that for the quarter ending\r\nSeptember, 1916, the amount expended for this service was $633,713.21.\r\nThe number of pieces delivered was nearly 8,000,000, or a yearly\r\naverage of something like 32,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Mail Service\r\n\r\nThe foreign mail service of the United States dates back to 1868, when\r\nJames H. Blackfan was chief clerk of the Department. This service was\r\nthen in charge of the chief clerk and when the office of Superintendent\r\nof Foreign Mails was created he was placed in charge of it. These\r\nmails are carried under the Act of 1891. All mails not carried by the\r\nmileage basis under this act are carried by non-contract vessels on the\r\nweight basis. The total cost of this service in 1916 was $2,228,341.\r\nThe rate of compensation allowed under the general statute for the sea\r\nconveyance of United States mails by steamers of American register, not\r\noperated under the ocean mail Act of 1891, is not exceeding the full\r\npostage of the mails conveyed. The two principal offices from which\r\nforeign mail is dispatched are New York and San Francisco. Clerks are\r\nassigned to this service as need requires. Under the regulations of the\r\nUniversal Postal Convention, mail matter other than parcel post, may\r\nbe dispatched whether fully prepaid or not, but as double the amount\r\nof postage is collectable when not fully prepaid, postmasters in this\r\ncountry have been instructed whenever practicable to notify senders\r\nof short-paid letters that such double expense might be avoided. On\r\nregistered articles and parcel post packages, full prepayment is\r\ncompulsory. Rate of postage is 5 cents for the first ounce or fraction\r\nof an ounce, and 3 cents for each additional ounce or fraction thereof.\r\nLetter postage for England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and British\r\npossessions goes at 2 cents an ounce. International parcel post rate is\r\n12 cents per pound or fraction of a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopography Branch\r\n\r\nThe impetus given to this branch of the service, the making of maps,\r\nby the rapid growth of rural delivery, the reorganization of which\r\nmade the completion of county maps an almost immediate necessity, has\r\nconsiderably stimulated activity in this direction and been productive\r\nof great benefit generally. Recompilations of State maps have been\r\nmade, old drawings brought up to date and diagram maps replaced by\r\nthose of the regular edition. The making of maps has developed into\r\nquite an industry in recent years owing to the greatly increased need\r\nfor such matter. Few people realize how necessary such aid is in\r\ndetermining questions of administrative concern, especially in such\r\nvast areas of public enterprise as the growth and extension of the\r\nrural delivery and star route service involves.\r\n\r\nThese public maps are very largely used for post routes and altogether\r\nthis branch occupies quite an important place in Department operations.\r\nOf the post-route class 43,258 were printed during the year of 1916,\r\n1,545 were sold to the public, together with 5,983 county and 1,963\r\nlocal center maps (blueprints) the balance having been distributed to\r\nthe postal service, to other Departments and to Members of Congress. In\r\nthe blue-printing plant 7,964 county maps, 13,330 local center maps,\r\nand 10,347 miscellaneous plans, forms, etc., were made.\r\n\r\nOf the 3,010 counties in the United States there are 2,630 in which\r\nrural delivery service is in operation. Accurate maps, showing\r\nrural service in 984 of these counties, have been completed, while\r\npreliminary maps for 755 others, giving similar information, have been\r\ndrawn. Base maps and other data are in hand which will be used in the\r\ncompilation of maps of 432 additional counties. Active steps are being\r\ntaken to procure information from every possible source for use in\r\ncompiling maps of the 459 remaining counties.\r\n\r\nThese maps of every county in the United States in which rural\r\nservice has been established, are made on a scale of 1 inch to the\r\nmile. They show all public roads, rural routes, post offices, houses,\r\nschool-houses, churches and streams. Negative prints are sold at 35\r\ncents each by application to the Third Assistant Postmaster General.\r\nLists are furnished on request showing maps completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Post Office Service\r\n\r\nOn the first of July, 1916, a new division was created in the office\r\nof the First Assistant Postmaster General to be known as the Division\r\nof Post Office Service. This new division absorbs the duties formerly\r\nperformed by the City Delivery and the Division of Salaries and\r\nAllowances. All persons employed directly in post offices as well as\r\nthe city carriers will now come under the control of this division.\r\nIt will also include every function relating to the handling and the\r\nmoving of the mails in the cities and towns of the country. More\r\nefficiency and better results generally are confidently expected to\r\nfollow this change which is in line with the general policy of placing\r\nall closely related duties under the same jurisdiction and control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSpecial Articles on Postal Subjects\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Postal System\r\n\r\nThe genius of the American Postal System is found in the harmonious\r\ncooperation of its several parts, in direction and in operation; wise\r\npolicy and purpose as seen in the formulation of plans, with willing\r\nassistance in operation to render such plans effective. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral directs the policy, the bureau heads execute what is determined\r\nupon and the benefit or failure is seen in practical administration.\r\nAll alike share in achievement, the mind that conceives, the heads that\r\ndirect, and the force upon whose faithful and intelligent effort the\r\noutcome depends.\r\n\r\nA form of Government democratic in all its parts and tendencies\r\nrequires fidelity and patriotic purpose in performance from every one\r\nto whom any trust is committed, and in every successful accomplishment\r\nof any given plan or purpose, the measure of success is always in\r\nproportion to the interest taken or the industry with which such plan\r\nor purpose is pursued. Loyalty alike to administrative endeavor or the\r\npublic welfare is imperatively required and unless this is faithfully\r\nand ungrudgingly given no plan can succeed, even the best devised must\r\nsurely fail. There is such a thing as patriotic devotion to public duty\r\nand no man is fit to hold an office of trust no matter how small it may\r\nbe who does not consider this as an obligation to be met and honestly\r\ndischarged. If any one thing has contributed to make our postal\r\nestablishment prosperous and great it is the conscious acceptance\r\nof the full meaning of such an obligation. This has distinguished\r\nAmericans in all public employment, emphasizing the stirring words\r\nof Lord Nelson, England’s great naval commander, whose injunction to\r\npatriotic response upon a memorable occasion deserves to be remembered\r\nin civil life as well, for loyalty and patriotism are as much in\r\naccord there, as much demanded in ordinary civil functions as in the\r\nmore heroic, but not less honorable and useful pursuit common to our\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderate Treatment of Newspaper Mail\r\n\r\nWhen General Gresham was Postmaster General in President Arthur’s\r\nadministration, the Washington correspondent of the _Louisville\r\nCourier-Journal_ complained to him about the non-delivery of\r\nnewspapers mailed by private individuals. “What do you think is the\r\nreason?” asked General Gresham. “I attribute the failure,” said\r\nthe correspondent, “to the carelessness of post office officials.\r\nA newspaper in their mind is a very small thing and it is handled\r\naccordingly. If the address is the least unintelligible no effort is\r\nmade to decipher it and it is tossed on the floor and if the wrapper\r\nhappens to be torn it shares the same fate, and I believe that\r\nnewspapers are often torn open and read without any conscientious\r\nscruples whatever.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you told me about the alleged carelessness that exists in\r\npost offices in the country,” said General Gresham. “I shall give the\r\nmatter prompt attention. If I cannot work out a reform in that respect,\r\nI would remove a postmaster for breaking the wrapper of a newspaper or\r\nmaking away with it as quick as I would if he had torn open a letter.\r\nOne is as sacred as the other.”\r\n\r\nBureau of Engraving and Printing\r\n\r\nStamp Manufacture\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing in which all the postage stamps\r\nused by the Government are manufactured is a wonderful institution\r\nevery way. Every known appliance and all that the mechanical skill and\r\ningenuity of the Director, Hon. Joseph E. Ralph, and his very capable\r\nexpert and designer, Mr. B. R. Stickney, could devise, have been\r\nbrought into requisition for the purposes the Bureau is intended to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nThe various operations required in printing postage stamps alone, of\r\nwhich such enormous quantities are annually required, would seem a\r\ngreat undertaking, but when to this is added the printing of all the\r\npaper money, bonds and securities used by the Government, the magnitude\r\nof the task may be understood. Between four and five thousand people\r\nfind employment within the Bureau, the greatest establishment of its\r\nkind in the world. Thousands of visitors annually witness the wonders\r\ntherein displayed and come away impressed with the marvels they have\r\nseen in the adaption of means to a definite purpose. The care and\r\ncomfort of the employes is a matter of deep concern to the Director\r\nand every possible method of providing for both, by approved means\r\nof sanitation and ventilation, is availed of. The air is washed and\r\nstrained to cleanse it of all impurities and full hospital provision\r\nmade for those who may need medical care and attention. Nothing seems\r\nto have been forgotten or overlooked in this most wonderful of all\r\ngovernment establishments and the result is that under favorable\r\nworking conditions the utmost that may be expected is fully realized.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary postage stamps are in denominations of from 1 cent to $1\r\nand of nineteen kinds. The output is 40,000,000 daily, or something\r\nlike thirteen billions per annum, with a face value in 1915 of\r\n$221,875,000. They are printed in sheets of 400 each, which are divided\r\nand subdivided until the sheet contains 100 stamps in which amount they\r\nare sent to the post offices for public use. The various processes used\r\nin manufacture, the printing, gumming and perforating, are separately\r\nperformed on the sheets of stamps; those intended for slot machines\r\nare printed and perfected on a rotary press which performs all the\r\noperations at once. This press, the invention of Mr. Stickney, after\r\nseven years of labor, will save 65 per cent of the cost of printing\r\nstamps per annum or $280,000, and will completely revolutionize stamp\r\nprinting from intaglio plates. It combines twenty-three operations in\r\none. It prints, gums and perforates the stamps, cuts them into sections\r\nof 100 stamps each, or will finish the stamps in coils of 500 and 1,000\r\nstamps per coil. It turns out the finished product ready for shipment\r\nto the postmasters of the country. As an object lesson to further show\r\nthe tremendous proportions of this postage stamp industry, it may be\r\nstated that the daily output would cover approximately eight acres of\r\nland if laid flat or make a chain of stamps 703 miles long if laid end\r\nto end. The sheets of 100 stamps each sent to post offices in 1915,\r\npiled up one upon another, would make a shaft over 6 miles high, and\r\nplaced end to end would make a strip over 16,000 miles long and as\r\nthere are ten rows of stamps on each sheet, a strip of single stamps\r\nwould be more than 160,000 miles long, enough to girdle the earth six\r\ntimes with something over.\r\n\r\nThe paper required to print these stamps for the year 1915 amounted to\r\n1,200,000 pounds, and to make this paper and to obtain this amount,\r\n3,500 spruce trees were ground to a pulp. Converted into lumber this\r\nwould have built fifty houses complete. The amount of ink required was\r\n670,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the post office inspectors, unannounced, visited the Bureau at\r\nthe close of the fiscal year of 1915 to check up the accounts, they\r\nwere found correct to the last one-cent stamp, a high compliment to the\r\nexcellent accounting system in practice at that institution.\r\n\r\nOrders for stamps are received daily from the Office of the Third\r\nAssistant Postmaster General and shipped by the Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost Office Inspectors\r\n\r\nThe Division of Post Office Inspectors is in many ways one of the\r\nmost interesting in the postal service. The duties are varied and of\r\nespecial importance, as the Post Office Inspector when on duty for the\r\nDepartment is the official representative of the Postmaster General and\r\nclothed with all due official authority. The purpose of such officials\r\nis to have ready at hand reliable men for confidential work. Unusual\r\ncapacity is required, tact, judgment, patience and courage. The duties\r\nof an inspector are not measured by the ordinary hours of employment,\r\nbut depend altogether upon the nature of the work he is called upon\r\nto perform, day and night in successive order, being synonymous terms\r\nwhen especial service is required. Complaints are generally the basis\r\nof inquiry and operation, but the scope of duties takes a wide range,\r\ninvolving special work of any kind and in any direction. Irregularities\r\nin the service form the principal basis of complaints, but violations\r\nof postal laws, frauds and depredations upon the mails furnish a\r\nproportionate share.\r\n\r\nThe inspectors are assigned to duty in geographical divisions of the\r\ncountry under an inspector-in-charge, with the Chief Inspector at\r\nWashington in general control. As a rule inspectors do duty in their\r\ndivisions, but under the orders of the Postmaster General they may be\r\nsent anywhere. They are expected to be familiar with the Postal Laws\r\nand Regulations and conduct their inquiries in accordance therewith.\r\nThe division is directly under the Postmaster General and in the\r\nclassified civil service, and the selections made for this important\r\nservice represent men of intelligence and integrity. Volumes could\r\nbe written of the strategy employed and methods pursued in tracing\r\ncriminal operations. The more agreeable duties, however, require an\r\nequal amount of skill though attended with less danger and difficulty.\r\nThe force of inspectors has been largely increased in recent years\r\nbecause of postal growth and development in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railway Mail Service\r\n\r\nThe Railway Mail Service of the United States, the most splendid of\r\nall the branches of the postal service, owes its origin to Hon. S.\r\nR. Hobbie of New York, First Assistant Postmaster General in the\r\nadministration of President Jackson. Upon his return from Europe in\r\n1847, he made a report to the Department giving his impression of the\r\ntraveling post office in England. The Department was then struggling\r\nwith many difficulties in the distribution and bagging of the mails and\r\none plan after another was tried with but indifferent success. Finally\r\nJudge Holt, Postmaster General in 1862, determined to try the English\r\nsystem and the first railway post office was introduced in the postal\r\nservice of the country. The overland mails were then carried by stage\r\ncoaches from the west side of the Missouri River to California and the\r\nimmense accumulation of mail matter at Saint Joseph, Mo., destined for\r\nthe Pacific Coast and the intermediate States, induced the Postmaster\r\nGeneral to establish the first railway post office on the Hannibal and\r\nSt. Joseph Railroad (Quincy, Ill., to St. Joseph, Mo), the pioneer\r\nroad in Railway Mail Service history. The growth of the Railway Mail\r\nService has been marvelous and its achievements unequalled in modern\r\nprogressive developement. Three thousand five hundred railroad mail\r\nroutes, aggregating 502,937,359 miles of service and employing nearly\r\n19,000 postal clerks and supervisors with salaries amounting to over\r\n$26,000,000 attest the strength and greatness of this magnificent arm\r\nof the postal service. Of the 14,369,582,586 pieces of mail matter\r\ndistributed and re-distributed during the past year, 14,367,325,426\r\npieces, or 99.984 per cent, were handled correctly--a record which\r\nshould be a matter of pride to every man who wears the badge of the R.\r\nM. S. The fifteen divisions in which the whole service is divided each\r\ncomplete in itself, but responsive to central control and direction in\r\nWashington, has brought the system to such a state of perfection that\r\nbut little remains for further experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parcel Post and the Opposition to Its Establishment\r\n\r\nThe splendid showing made in the recent reports of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral touching the growth and development of the Parcel Post in this\r\nadministration must be of interest to the people of the country for\r\nwhose benefit this measure has been so successfully conducted. Its\r\nadmitted usefulness brings forcibly to mind the struggle through which\r\nthis measure passed before the force of public opinion and the evident\r\nadvantage it foreshadowed, secured its ultimate adoption.\r\n\r\nWhile in the American Republic history is rapidly made and startling\r\nchanges are not of infrequent or uncommon occurrence, it is, however,\r\ntrue that subjects which provoke discussion because cherished interests\r\nare endangered or settled opinions of public policy liable to be\r\noverthrown, require time in which to adjust themselves to changing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe student of political economy will be interested to note how these\r\nchanges of time and condition affect the opinion and views of men\r\nidentified with public affairs. What seems wisdom and good judgment in\r\none generation is opposed and set aside in another, both acting for the\r\ngeneral welfare and inspired by patriotic purpose.\r\n\r\nThe proper scope and purpose of government, in its relation to the\r\npeople whom it serves, is always a matter of deep concern, not only as\r\nto the views held by those appointed to administer public affairs, but\r\nalso in the opinions and ideas of the people themselves. While a great\r\nprinciple may remain in many minds the same, unchanged and reluctant to\r\nchange, conditions may operate to produce views entirely dissimilar and\r\ncompletely at variance with those of another and previous period.\r\n\r\nTwo greatly divergent and distinctive opinions have divided the\r\nthinkers and the statesmen of our country as to the proper functions of\r\nsuch a government as this. This difference arising from the educational\r\nenvironment of many leaders of public opinion, easily became a matter\r\nof accepted political or party belief between those who held to the\r\nlimitations of delegated authority and those who inclined to wider\r\npower and greater privilege. Both have had earnest and strenuous\r\nadvocates, but the tendencies of the times conclusively point to the\r\ngrowing acceptance of the latter as more suited to a great and growing\r\nnation whose needs may not be fettered by tradition or obstinate\r\nblindness to the march of progress, but must recognize the paramount\r\ninterests of the people whose welfare should always be the chief\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nThe Parcel Post is now a recognized benefit to the country. All classes\r\nand conditions profit by its mutual advantage. Its gigantic strides\r\nto popular favor cannot be measured or adequately described. The\r\nburdensome exactions of the high tariffs, which corporate enterprise\r\nso long interposed, have been lifted and closer relation established\r\nbetween buyer and seller, by which both are the gainer. As no\r\ncompromise was possible where monopoly was concerned, it remained for\r\nthe Government to set aside the question of limited powers and give\r\nthe people of the country the benefit to which they were entitled, but\r\nwhich monopoly denied, viz., the opportunity to profit by the use of\r\nthe facilities which were at hand and which have proven so thoroughly\r\neffective. Two names stand out prominently in this connection, the\r\nstatesman whose thorough knowledge of the subject and whose earnest\r\nand intelligent efforts shaped and directed this great public measure,\r\nand the public official whose hearty cooperation assured its success.\r\nHon. David J. Lewis, of Maryland, and Hon. Albert S. Burleson, the\r\nPostmaster General, deserve the thanks of the country for their work in\r\nthis beneficial enterprise and the meed of praise will not be withheld.\r\n\r\nThe old-time belief in the necessity of curbing the ambitious designs\r\nof those who were striving to open the way to an enlargement of\r\ngovernment privilege is strikingly seen in the attitude of Postmaster\r\nGeneral Jewell in his annual report to Congress in 1874. In referring\r\nto the activity then already seen to widen the scope of the Post Office\r\nDepartment and engage in enterprises held by many at that time and the\r\nPostmaster General in particular, as foreign to the sphere of duties\r\nand intended purposes and powers of the Department, Mr. Jewell said:\r\n\r\n “I would suggest that the time has come when a resolute effort should be\r\n made to determine how far the Post Office Department can properly go in\r\n its efforts to accommodate the public, without trespassing unwarrantably\r\n upon the sphere of private enterprise. There must be a limit to\r\n governmental interferency and happily it better suits the genius of\r\n the American people to help themselves than to depend on the State. To\r\n communicate intelligence and disseminate information are the primary\r\n functions of this Department. Any divergence from the legitimate sphere\r\n of its operations tends to disturb the just rule that, in the ordinary\r\n business of life, the recipient of a benefit is the proper party to\r\n pay for it, since there is no escape from the universal law that every\r\n service must in some way be paid for by some one. Moreover, in a country\r\n of vast extent like ours, where most of the operations of the Department\r\n are carried on remote from the controlling center, the disposition to\r\n engage in lateral enterprises, more or less foreign to the theory of\r\n the system, may lead to embarrassments whence extrication would be\r\n difficult.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the advocates of the privileged rights of private enterprise\r\nhave ever resisted the entrance of government into the field of\r\nnational endeavor, the triumphant progress of the Parcel Post under\r\nDepartmental direction has silenced all captious objection, for its\r\nadmitted adaptation to the needs of the country and its growing\r\npopularity among the people, attests the fact that no limitations can\r\nbe wisely set in public affairs which bars the progress of an intended\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was later made in 1901 to check the growth of public\r\nsentiment favorable to the establishment of the Parcel Post, for which\r\na bill has been introduced into Congress, by a concerted movement, by\r\nwhom originated is not known, which aimed to arouse the merchants in\r\nrural sections in opposition thereto, a widespread propaganda, the\r\nobject of which was to flood President McKinley with a stereotyped\r\ncircular signed by these rural merchants all over the country, in order\r\nthat such measure might not meet with his approval because of the wreck\r\nand ruin it would be sure to create. To what extent this movement\r\nwas carried or what attention it received from President McKinley is\r\nnot known, but the fears of Postmaster General Jewell or the alarm\r\nof the rural merchants were not borne out in the light of subsequent\r\nevents, as the successful progress of the Parcel Post has abundantly\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis popular measure was, however, not to be secured for the public\r\ngood without strenuous effort, even in these later days when its early\r\nadoption was so clearly foreseen. It still had to encounter opposition,\r\nthe lingering echo of previous struggle. Its friends had to meet and\r\ncombat resistance, within and without the halls of legislation and it\r\nwas only by determined purpose and a concert of effort that criticism\r\nwas finally silenced and the measure written into the statutes of the\r\nnation. Congress passed the act, August 24, 1912, and the struggle of\r\nnearly half a century was at an end with the popular will triumphant.\r\n\r\nFirst recommended in 1892. Law passed by Congress August 2, 1912.\r\nBecame operative January 1, 1913. It is in operation on 45,000 rural\r\nroutes and a billion parcels are carried annually. Parcels may be sent\r\nC. O. D., may be insured, 3 cents for parcels valued up to $5 or less\r\nand a low graduated scale up to $100. Indemnity is paid for partial\r\nloss or damage. Rate is charged by weight in pounds and by zones. Books\r\nare now admitted and all classes of proper merchandise accepted. Weight\r\nis limited to 50 pounds for first and second zones (150 miles) and to\r\n20 pounds beyond. Postmasters will give all necessary information.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting Facts about the Postmasters General\r\n\r\nExcluding the border States, the South, properly speaking, has had but\r\ntwo men in the office of Postmaster General since the days of Benjamin\r\nFranklin--Joseph Habersham, of Georgia, and Albert Sidney Burleson,\r\nof Texas. The more populous States of the east, with their political\r\npower and material advantages, have had the greatest number of such\r\nappointments, 23 of the 48 men who have held that office having come\r\nfrom that section. The border States have had 15 and the west only\r\n8. It was not until 1866 that the west was at all recognized in the\r\nappointment of such cabinet officer, when Alexander W. Randall, of\r\nWisconsin, was chosen by President Johnson. Subsequently that State\r\nfurnished three more Postmasters General, viz., Howe, Vilas and Payne.\r\nIn 1829 the Postmaster General became a member of the cabinet by the\r\naction of President Jackson, his first appointee to that position, Hon.\r\nWilliam T. Barry, of Kentucky, receiving that honor.\r\n\r\nIn considering the States of the Union which have been most fortunate\r\nin appointments to this office, it is found that Pennsylvania and New\r\nYork have each had 6 to their credit; Connecticut, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nand Wisconsin, 4 each; Massachusetts, Maryland, and Ohio, 3 each,\r\nand the remainder scattered among the 18 States from which all the\r\nPostmasters General have been selected.\r\n\r\nThe term of service was, it seems, much longer in the olden days than\r\nat present. From 1775 to 1850--75 years--there were only 17 men in\r\nthat position, Gideon Granger, of Connecticut, having served 13 years\r\nand 8 months, and Return J. Meigs, of Ohio, 9 years and 3 months. From\r\n1850 to 1913--63 years--there have been 31 men in that office. Whether\r\nthe shifting currents of political life and expediency, or other\r\ncauses, have operated to make changes in this office, it appears that\r\nmany occurred in the administrations of some of our chief executives.\r\nRoosevelt, for instance, had four Postmasters General; Grant, Arthur,\r\nand Cleveland (in the latter’s two terms) also had 4 each; Washington\r\nand Buchanan, 3; Jackson, Fillmore, Lincoln, Hayes, and McKinley, 2\r\neach. The remainder of the Presidents evidently retained the men they\r\nhad originally appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithdrawal of Letters from the Mail\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that a letter once mailed can be\r\nwithdrawn. Such is, however, the case. Letters may be withdrawn from\r\nthe mails at the office of mailing by satisfactory identification, a\r\nwritten address in the same handwriting, if address was written, or\r\nsuch other evidence as will satisfy the postmaster of the applicant’s\r\nright to withdrawal. If letter has already been dispatched the\r\npostmaster may telegraph to the point of destination for withholding\r\nsuch letter from delivery, or to a railway postal clerk in whose\r\ncustody the letter is known to be, carefully describing the same and\r\nrequesting its return. A sum must be deposited with the postmaster\r\nsufficient to defray all expenses incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling of the Mail\r\n\r\nOfficial mail comes to the Department addressed to the several\r\nBureaus. It is then opened, assorted to the various divisions and\r\nredistributed to the clerks according to the subjects named or special\r\nduties assigned to each. The divisions are supervised by the official\r\nin charge, under whose direction the work is done and by whom the\r\nresponsibility is assumed. He advises with and suggests methods of\r\noperation, and in important matters involving special correspondence,\r\nassumes direct charge himself. Letters written by clerks are submitted\r\nto the chief for examination before being initialed for mailing, or for\r\nthe signature of the Bureau heads where such signature is required.\r\nLetters are answered according to date of receipt all reasonable\r\npromptness being enjoined. Filing is done according to the nature and\r\nduties of the various bureaus and the character of correspondence\r\nand papers in use. Approved systems are followed and metal filing\r\ncases generally employed. In the Bureau of the Fourth Assistant where\r\nmonthly reports are received in connection with the regular mail,\r\nduring the month of January, 1917, the amount so received aggregated\r\n72,000 pieces, and 46,000 pieces of mail were dispatched. Ordinary\r\nhand work could not dispose of such amounts with the force assigned,\r\ntherefore mechanical devices for opening and sealing mail are employed\r\nfor the purpose. Messengers gather the outgoing mail by regular rounds\r\nand it is dispatched as soon as brought to the mailing room. A work\r\nof considerable magnitude in this Bureau is now being conducted,\r\nviz., the purging of the accumulated rural and star route files and\r\ncorrespondence which had so grown in bulk as to make both search and\r\nhandling difficult. It was a much needed reform and will be found of\r\nespecial value in filing operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost Accounting\r\n\r\nBy means of an accurate cost-keeping system devised for the equipment\r\nshops, but which can be adapted to any form of clerical expense, great\r\nimprovements have been made and savings effected. All mail equipment is\r\nnow supplied at a greatly reduced cost and in improved form. Supplies\r\nfor post offices are judiciously and economically handled under the\r\nsystem now in operation, all discoverable waste checked and the service\r\ngreatly benefited. The direct, the indirect and the overhead charges\r\ncan now be clearly ascertained in any form of manufacturing enterprise\r\nand the cost in any direction definitely known. It was a long felt need\r\nin economical administration and its introduction in the Post Office\r\nDepartment has been of decided advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCleansing Mail Bags\r\n\r\nThe life of a mail bag is about six years and after being dragged about\r\non railroad platforms and other places they accumulate an amount of\r\ndust and dirt which renders them unfit for handling when returned to\r\nthe bag shop for repair. The old practice was to shake them out by\r\nhand, but in the hurry and haste of business this was but imperfectly\r\ndone and there was constant complaint among the operators and clamor\r\nfor a better system. After many experiments and various tests a method\r\nwas at length devised which cleans them thoroughly and does away with\r\nthe discomfort under which the work was done. The method finally\r\nadopted consists of large tumbling barrels or cages made of wood with\r\nslats and fashioned in the shape of a star, holding several hundred\r\nbags each. Driven rapidly by electric power the bags are thoroughly\r\nshaken, the escaping dust confined in a tightly constructed room\r\nand carried off by blowers into an immense canvas bag resembling a\r\ndirigible balloon when inflated. At stated intervals the end of this\r\nbag is opened and the dirt and dust removed. Four thousand bags a day\r\nare now successfully treated by this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farm-to-Table Movement\r\n\r\nAs the farm-to-table movement is now attracting a great deal of public\r\nattention and is directly connected with the postal service by its\r\nafforded means of communication, some observations upon the subject may\r\nbe worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nThere are four fundamental facts connected with the subject, viz., the\r\npoints of production, places of consumption, methods of operation and\r\nmeans of communication. Production is upon the farm, consumption in the\r\ncities and towns, methods, to be determined by experience, and the mode\r\nand means of conveyance, a government function.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first of these divisions, certain facts are apparent.\r\nThe balance of trade, eight to one is against the farmer at the\r\npoint of production; he receives very much more than he sends. Why\r\nthis disproportion? It is caused either by lack of interest in the\r\nsubject, or because of lack of practical experience in the successful\r\nmanagement of such business enterprise. The remedy in either case\r\nis in his hands. If interest is wanting he should cultivate it; if\r\nhe has made experiments and they have failed of proper results, he\r\nshould not become discouraged but try again. High prices in the cities\r\nlead the residents there to seek relief by direct dealings with the\r\nproducer. The consumer will reach him if he puts himself in touch\r\nwith the man who is seeking, and the desire to sell his goods and do\r\nbusiness, should lead the producer to inquire how best it can be done.[\r\nThe postmaster can help him by advice and counsel and it should be a\r\npleasurable duty for the postmaster to advise and confer with, and put\r\nthe producer (who is his patron), in the way of profitable business\r\nintercourse with the man in the city who needs him and is only too\r\nanxious to find who he is, where he lives, and what he has to sell.\r\n\r\nWhile the country postmaster at the point of production has a duty\r\nto perform in advising with the producer (for the postmaster is to\r\nall intents and purposes the “middleman” in this connection) the city\r\npostmaster has also a duty to perform in assisting the resident there\r\nto find the most convenient places of production and how such places\r\ncan be easily reached and what can be procured there that the city\r\nresident wants and needs. Many postmasters are now paying especial\r\nattention to this matter on account of the urgent necessity which the\r\nhigh prices, and diminished quantities of provision that come to the\r\ncities, render so necessary, but conditions require that many more\r\nshould be engaged in that direction to afford all the benefit this\r\ngreat measure of the Government was intended to give.\r\n\r\nThe methods, the best methods to obtain the end desired, both at the\r\npoint of production, where the supply is found, and at the point\r\nof consumption to which this supply is to be transported, must be\r\ndiscovered by the actual results which the various methods that have\r\nbeen tried have produced, or were found to be most advantageous and\r\nmost successful. Many plans have been suggested and tried out, but it\r\nmust remain for experience to demonstrate and determine which of these\r\nis best and most likely to secure advantageous benefits.\r\n\r\nThe remaining question is the part the Government is called upon to\r\nperform to reap the most possible results and make the farm-to-table\r\nmovement popular and profitable. The Government is more ready to act\r\nthan either producer or consumer seem to be; to extend every privilege\r\nand afford every accommodation which postal enterprise or the public\r\npurse can provide, that this, in some sense paternal relation of\r\ngovernment to people in benevolent provision for their welfare, may\r\nsecure all that its most sanguine projectors ever hoped to accomplish.\r\nIt has the support of Congress, and the Postmaster General has omitted\r\nno word or act which could in any manner contribute to its success\r\nand stands ready to do the utmost that his great office and his great\r\nopportunity afford, to make this measure a benefit and a boon to all\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe readjustment of prices will come, and the remedy appear, when the\r\nelimination of so much handling, packing, repacking and distributing\r\nwith its consequent loss and its increased cost, decreases the cost\r\nwhich the consumer has to meet for all this added labor, and for which\r\nhe pays the price, and from which burden the parcel post by its direct\r\nand better system of exchange aims to free and relieve him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Service in Alaska\r\n\r\nAlaska is so far off that its interests do not commonly concern the\r\npeople to any great extent. The Government, however, takes a more\r\npaternal view of its only territorial possession in North America,\r\nand has paid particular attention to its progress and development,\r\nespecially in postal affairs and the means of communication among\r\nthe people. Alaska has now 170 post offices of which 45 have money\r\norder facilities. It has 21 star routes with an aggregate length of\r\n4,544 miles and an annual travel of 249,331.10 miles. Annual rate\r\nof expenditure, $260,518.50. Average rate of cost per mile traveled,\r\n$1.04. Average number of trips per week, 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandardization in Post Office Methods\r\n\r\nDuring this administration a very important change was made in the\r\nmanagement and conduct of the larger post offices of the country.\r\nIt was found that the delivery of parcel post matter by vehicle was\r\ncosting from 1 to 6 cents each. Investigation showed that this varying\r\ncost was largely due to lack of uniformity in methods and equipment\r\nand that the need of standardization extended to every branch of post\r\noffice service. Postal experts were accordingly sent to all sections of\r\nthe country to study existing methods and recommend necessary changes.\r\nAs a result, unnecessary independent divisions in post offices were\r\neliminated and two divisions established, one in charge of records,\r\naccounts and financial services, the other to have charge of the\r\nmail handling operations. The personnel of the offices also received\r\nattention, that as far as possible, clerks could be assigned to the\r\nduties for which they were best fitted. Subsequent investigation\r\nconfirmed the advantage of such standardization, and the large post\r\noffices which handle 75 per cent of the nation’s mail, have now been\r\nbrought under such improved control that the benefit which such\r\nintelligent methods, properly carried out, should naturally develop,\r\nhas been abundantly shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Savings Circulars in Foreign Tongues\r\n\r\nThe Government has for years been anxious to reach citizens of foreign\r\nbirth residing in the United States for the purpose of informing them\r\nrelative to our Postal Savings System. Circulars have now been issued\r\nin the mother tongue to Bohemian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Danish,\r\nNorwegian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Magyar, Italian,\r\nJapanese, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Ruthenian, Serbian,\r\nSlovak, Sloverian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish people here which have\r\nbeen widely distributed and are expected to be of considerable service.\r\nThe foreign born population in this country, according to the census of\r\n1910, numbers over 13,000,000 and it is believed that the business of\r\nthe Postal Savings System would be greatly increased if the attention\r\nof these people could be properly directed to its advantages, and\r\nthese circulars in their own language are intended for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Enterprise of a Patriotic Maryland Editor\r\n\r\nIt seems from old records on the subject as mentioned in the\r\n_Washington Evening Star_, that some of the editors of the colonial\r\nperiod of our history had quite a good deal to say and took a very\r\nactive part in shaping political events, particularly in postal\r\naffairs. One Maryland editor, Goddard by name, when his papers were\r\nrefused in the mails on account of his outspoken views, set about\r\nestablishing what he called “A Constitutional American Post Office.”\r\nHe issued a circular, July 2, 1774, announcing his plan, and went\r\nabout the colonies soliciting support. Committees were appointed and\r\nsubscriptions of money secured, postmasters designated, riders secured\r\nand service established, which was instantly patronized. Crown post\r\nriders found the roads unsafe and resigned. Goddard was printer of the\r\n_Maryland Journal_, printed at Baltimore, and by the early part of 1775\r\nhe had thirty offices and nine post riders, covering the territory from\r\nMassachusetts to Virginia, including Georgetown-on-the-Potomac.\r\n\r\nIt was a private service, operated in opposition to the still\r\nexisting British service. Goddard had declared his desire to have the\r\nContinental Congress assume charge and administer this service for all\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress took up the matter and appointed a committee\r\ncomposed of Mr. Franklin, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Lee, Mr. Willing, Mr. Adams,\r\nand Mr. P. Livingston, who brought in their report July 25, 1775.\r\n\r\nThe report was taken up and considered the next day, July 26, 1775,\r\nwhen it was resolved, that a Postmaster General be appointed for the\r\nUnited Colonies. The record of the Continental Congress on that day\r\n(postal independence day), then closes with the unanimous election of\r\nBenjamin Franklin to be Postmaster General.\r\n\r\n\r\nDamage in Handling Parcel Post Mail\r\n\r\nA study of 4,219 reports received at the headquarters of the various\r\nRailway Mail Service Divisions during a thirty-day investigation, held\r\nrecently to discover the amount of damage in handling parcel post mail\r\nand the causes of such damage, it was found that in 52.31 per cent of\r\nthe cases damage was caused by improper preparation of the parcels by\r\nsenders. The result of this investigation may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cases of damage caused by improper preparation\r\n    of sender                                     2,207\r\n  Cases of damage caused by improper handling\r\n    by postmaster                                   107\r\n  Cases of damage caused by improper handling\r\n    by Railway Mail Service employes                 43\r\n  Cases of damage caused by improper handling\r\n    by railroad employes                             54\r\n  Cases of damage from miscellaneous causes         188\r\n  Cases of damage from unknown causes             1,620\r\n                                                 ------\r\n          Total                                   4,219\r\n\r\n  Cases of damage to--\r\n    Eggs                                    355    8.41\r\n    Butter                                   99    2.35\r\n    Hats                                    119    2.82\r\n    Paint                                    20     .47\r\n    Powders                                  59    1.40\r\n    Preserves                               129    3.06\r\n    Liquids                                 925   21.92\r\n    Foodstuffs                              575   13.63\r\n    Merchandise                           1,002   23.75\r\n    China and glass                         368    8.72\r\n    Liquids                                 925   21.92\r\n    Fruit                                   194    4.60\r\n    Poultry                                  51    1.21\r\n    Flowers                                  53    1.26\r\n    Other articles                          270    6.40\r\n                                         ------  ------\r\n                                          4,219  100.00\r\n  Damage cases insured                      137    3.25\r\n  Damage cases on star routes               304    7.21\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Opinion by Daniel Webster on Mail Extension\r\n\r\nIn this period of unprecedented postal growth and activity when\r\nhistory is rapidly made and great achievements are born in a day, it\r\nis interesting to recall that in 1835, during the discussion of a\r\nmeasure in the United States Senate to establish a post route from\r\nIndependence, Mo., to the mouth of the Colorado River, the learned\r\nDaniel Webster closed his speech in opposition with the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n “What do we want with this vast worthless area; this region of savages\r\n and wild beasts, of deserts, shifting sands, and whirlwinds of dust;\r\n of cactus and prairie dogs? To what use can we hope to put these great\r\n deserts or those endless mountain ranges, imposing and covered to their\r\n very base with eternal snow? What use have we for such country? Mr.\r\n President, I will never vote 1 cent from the Public Treasury to place\r\n the Pacific Coast 1 inch nearer to Boston than it now is.”\r\n\r\n“I can safely venture,” said Hon. D. C. Roper, late First Assistant\r\nPostmaster General in his speech at the Denver, Colo., Convention of\r\nthe National Association of Postmasters, in July, 1913, from which\r\nthis extract is made, “that were Mr. Webster to return to earth and\r\naccompany me on this western trip he would confess in chagrin that in\r\nno expression made during his long career as a public speaker was he\r\nwider of the mark.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Blind Woman on the Pay Roll\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how the blind, those who have been denied by nature\r\nor accident of the most priceless of all human faculties, can adapt\r\nthemselves to conditions whereby the means of support may be obtained.\r\nAll communities and great centers of population have doubtless\r\nsuch cases, especially where opportunities are afforded by private\r\nmunificence or public appropriation, but there are perhaps few cases\r\nwhere, in Government service, it is possible for a blind person to find\r\nan opportunity to earn a living. The Mail Bag Repair Shop at Washington\r\nfurnishes such a case and it is worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six years ago a blind girl, Miss Hattie Maddox, called to see\r\nPostmaster General Wanamaker and asked for a place in the bag shop. She\r\nsaid, “You give seeing people a two months’ trial at the work, will\r\nyou give me that much time to prove that I can do it?” She then went\r\nto Colonel Whitfield, Second Assistant Postmaster General, who had\r\ncharge of such work, and showed him some crocheting she had done and\r\nthe opportunity she sought was given her. She is there today busy with\r\na pile of mail bags, stringing them with new cords, finding weak spots\r\nand repairing them with needle and thread and does the work as well as\r\nany of those around her. An attendant from her home brings her to her\r\ndaily task and calls for her, and she is one of the most contented and\r\nhappy women on Uncle Sam’s pay roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wanamaker’s Four Great Postal Reforms\r\n\r\nMarshall Cushing, private secretary to Postmaster General Wanamaker,\r\nsays in his book “The Story of Our Post Office,” published some\r\nyears ago, that Mr. Wanamaker had in mind and frequently discussed\r\nwith public men, four great postal propositions, one of which this\r\nadministration is now vigorously pushing forward, while the other\r\nthree are still in abeyance. These propositions were the postal\r\ntelegraph, the postal telephone, rural free delivery and house-to-house\r\ncollections of mail. He regarded them as simple and easy business\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\nThe first proposed that the thousands of letter carriers of the\r\nDepartment should help the telegraph companies collect and deliver\r\nmessages, and that a few clerks in a central bureau at Washington could\r\nmanage the stamp department and do the book-keeping for this part of\r\nthe business of the companies. Telegrams were to be written on stamped\r\npaper, sold by the Department, or upon any sort of paper provided with\r\nstamps sold by the Department, and be deposited as in the case of\r\nletters whether on the streets or attached for collection and delivery\r\npurposes at house doors. These postal telegrams were to be collected by\r\ncarriers on their regular tours of collection and telegraphed to the\r\ndestinations and taken out and delivered in the first delivery. Answer\r\nto be sent off exactly in the same way.\r\n\r\nTelegraphic business was thus to be cheapened to the public because of\r\nthe lessened cost to the companies by this Government aid, commonly\r\nestimated at about one third of their whole operating expenses. The\r\ngain to the Government would be not only the 2 cents for postage\r\nrates proposed for telegrams under this scheme but also the impetus\r\ngiven by general correspondence. The gain to the companies would be\r\nthe additional patronage which lower rates and regular collection and\r\ndelivery would give, also the saving of this expense and the office\r\nuse, clerk hire, etc., and other expenses incidental thereto. This\r\nscheme was in no wise to interfere with the use of the quicker form\r\nof telegraphing for those who preferred it. It was simply intended\r\nto bring together in concerted action the two great machines for\r\nconveying intelligence, the telegraph plant of the companies and the\r\nfree delivery operating forces of the Department. This, in brief, was\r\nhis idea, but much more extensively elaborated in further supporting\r\narguments in its favor and in meeting objections where doubts of its\r\npracticability might be supposed to exist.\r\n\r\nThis proposition has been widely mentioned, has had many advocates,\r\nand it is interesting to note in this connection that Postmaster\r\nGeneral Burleson entertains a somewhat similar idea, and has in three\r\nannual reports to Congress urged the matter, however, with this\r\ndifference. Wanamaker’s plan did not contemplate taking over the\r\ntelegraph companies, simply entering into a mutual business arrangement\r\nwith them, while Postmaster General Burleson goes a step farther by\r\nthe incorporation of the telephone and telegraph into the postal\r\nestablishment. The opposition to the postal telegraph was as strong\r\nthen as now, its constitutionality being questioned by those who\r\noppose it. Mr. Wanamaker held that the powers granted to Congress by\r\nthe Constitution were not merely confined to the facilities known at\r\nthe time, but were to keep pace with the progress of the country, and\r\nMr. Burleson says, operation of these facilities inherently as well\r\nas constitutionally, belongs to the postal service. Both are thus in\r\naccord, differing only in method. The question is one of interest and\r\nits future development will be watched with considerable concern by all\r\nwho wish to see further progress in this direction.\r\n\r\nAs the second of Mr. Wanamaker’s propositions, the postal telephone,\r\nwith its tremendous opportunities and possibilities, especially\r\nin connection with rural delivery and parcel post advantages, the\r\nmagnitude and success of which even the enthusiastic and optimistic\r\nPennsylvanian did not then foresee, is bound up in General Burleson’s\r\nplan, and the third, the rural free delivery, is making such strides\r\ntowards country-wide extension that it is only a matter of time when it\r\nmay be brought near, the fourth of Mr. Wanamaker’s propositions remains\r\nonly to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis is the use of letter boxes for the collection as well as the\r\ndelivery of mail from and to everybody’s door in every city, town,\r\nvillage and farming community of the country. This means such an\r\nimmense convenience to everybody that he does not argue the case,\r\nbut simply points out its admitted advantages as a sufficient reason\r\nfor its early adoption. A disk at the door-box when mail was to be\r\ncollected would summon the carrier on his daily rounds, even if no\r\nmail was to be delivered; trips to the letter box on the corner would\r\nthen be no longer necessary, and the ease and certainty with which\r\ncollection would be made, would in Mr. Wanamaker’s opinion, give an\r\nimpulse to letter writing and increase the public revenue to a very\r\nconsiderable extent. It would mean two great conveniences to the\r\nfamily, the safe delivery of letters at their door and the equally safe\r\ncollection of mail therefrom. Of course to obtain this service, letter\r\nboxes would have to be provided by the householders, but Mr. Wanamaker\r\nbelieved that this complete accommodation would induce people to go to\r\nthat trifling expense in order to gain such an evident advantage. It\r\nwas tried in St. Louis in his time, and worked exceedingly well.\r\n\r\nPostmaster General Wanamaker was an official with a far-seeing vision\r\nand actively alive to all postal possibilities, and the present\r\nPostmaster General is fully abreast of him in every form of public\r\nenterprise which makes for the utmost in postal accomplishment (See\r\npage 83, for Postmaster General Burleson’s views regarding Postal\r\nTelegraphs and Telephones).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rural Carrier as a Weather Man\r\n\r\nIt is said that the most common topic among mankind everywhere is the\r\nweather. It follows nearly every greeting and salutation, introduces\r\nconversation, is always a subject of interest and affords opportunities\r\nof discussion upon which people can agree and disagree without exciting\r\nthe least disturbance whatever.\r\n\r\nIt has so much to do with the temper, the disposition the pleasures and\r\nthe material affairs of life that its compelling interest is admitted\r\nand the winds and clouds are ever objects of our daily attention. The\r\nGovernment recognizes this fact and has brought scientific knowledge to\r\nbear upon the subject for the benefit of the man who tills the soil,\r\nfor the mariner upon the sea and they who dwell in the cities, and for\r\nwhom wind and weather has also its peculiar interest and concern.\r\n\r\nWeather maps are common in the crowded cities and commercial centers,\r\nbut are not as convenient of access in the country districts, and aside\r\nfrom the reports in the morning papers, the farmer has no particular\r\nway of acquainting himself with the provision the Government has made\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that an easy and simple way of interesting and\r\ninforming the rural residents of the daily weather forecasts would be\r\nfor the carriers on rural routes who can obtain this information to\r\nmake it known by means of little flags attached to their vehicles,\r\nfor example, a white flag when the weather will be clear, a red flag\r\nwhen rain is indicated, a yellow flag for snow and a blue flag when\r\na cold wave is coming. This would be a daily guide, a matter of but\r\nlittle trouble to the carrier, and give his daily visits an additional\r\ninterest to all the patrons whom he serves.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Box Numbering System for Rural Routes\r\n\r\nIn the cities of the country the streets are named and the houses are\r\nnumbered by the authorities. The Department uses these numbers and\r\nstreet names in its mail deliveries. A letter to be properly addressed\r\nto a person or a firm needs only the number of the house or building\r\nand the name of the street. This method is very simple and the mail is\r\nspeedily and successfully handled.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts there are four systems in use by the\r\nDepartment, the railroads, and the express companies. The first\r\nsystem is where patrons erect boxes at their places of residence for\r\nthe collection and delivery of mail. The letter or parcel is simply\r\naddressed to the post office, to the patron and the rural route is\r\ngiven. The second is where a letter or parcel is addressed to the\r\npatron at a post office, with the number of the route, the box number,\r\nthe side of the road, and the miles from the office being embodied in\r\nthe box number. The third is where a letter or parcel is addressed to\r\na patron at a post office giving the route number and the number of\r\nthe patron’s box. The fourth system is where mail is addressed to the\r\npatron at an office giving the section and township where the patron\r\nlives. This latter system is used by the railroads relative to freight\r\nand express matter and definitely locates a person in any part of the\r\nUnited States. The addition of the rural route number and box makes the\r\nmost complete designation possible.\r\n\r\nThere has been an ingenious plan suggested (if it can be practically\r\nemployed), a newer and more complete method of numbering the boxes\r\nalong rural delivery routes indicating and locating the patrons thereon\r\nwhich will identify the patron with his place of residence, simplify\r\nassorting, and afford in many ways advantages not offered or included\r\nin the old method.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Present Method\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Suggested New Method\r\n\r\nThe diagram on the following page, which is intended to illustrate the\r\nsuggested new plan, shows that in any given three numbers, such as 111,\r\nthe first figure at the left would be the route number, the second\r\nfigure the number of the box, the third the distance from the supplying\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n_Explanation_: The first figure as indicated denotes the rural route\r\nnumber, the second figure denotes the box and its location on the mile,\r\nthe third or more figures denotes the miles from the supplying post\r\noffice. Each mile is divided into four quarters for box designation,\r\nthose on the right have the odd figures 1, 3, 5, 7, and those on the\r\nleft even figures 2, 4, 6, and 8. If there is more than one box in\r\na quarter, the other boxes are given the first box number in that\r\nquarter with the addition of a small letter _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc.,\r\nafter the mile figure or figures. The patron if he lived at the first\r\nquarter of a mile would be addressed--John Williams, Rayville, Ill.,\r\nRural Delivery 111. This would show that John Williams lives on rural\r\nroute number one, at the first quarter mile on the delivery part of\r\nthe route, and that it is the first box on the first mile. If he\r\nlived on the second mile at the third quarter he would be addressed\r\nRural Delivery 152, and his box would be so numbered. If he lived on\r\nthe second mile at the second quarter, and on the left-hand side of\r\nthe road, his box number would be 142. Where automobile routes are\r\nestablished a capital letter can be used instead of the first figure.\r\nIf it is desired, the section number can be used instead of the miles\r\nfigure or figures, and would then show where the patron lived in the\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Department has under consideration the\r\nquestion of locating the boxes on the right-hand side of the road for\r\nthe convenience of the carrier. The above system can be used whether\r\nall the boxes are located on the right side of the road or not. The\r\nquestion of entirely abandoning the practice of numbering boxes\r\nis also being considered and if adopted, this suggested method of\r\nadditional identification would of course be useless. It is simply\r\nmentioned here as an idea to aid in readily assorting mail in the\r\noffice and as a more complete method of identification than under the\r\npresent system. If the Department decides that the name of the owner on\r\nthe box is sufficient, this suggested new plan has no further value and\r\ncan be regarded as one of the many novel ideas in connection with the\r\nrural service which come up from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be said that a box once located and numbered always\r\nretains its identity and no matter how many persons live at, or move to\r\nor from that locality, the box number retains its identity the same as\r\na house retains its identity in a city.\r\n\r\n\r\nWireless Telephones in the Rural Service\r\n\r\nFrom that memorable day in June, 1875, when Alexander Graham Bell\r\ndiscovered a faint sound emanating from the curious little machine over\r\nwhich three years of patient labor had been spent, until today, when\r\nthe world is debtor to this great man for one of the marvels of the\r\nage, the telephone has been a constant wonder and especially so at this\r\ntime, when its adaptability for the common uses of life has made it of\r\nvalue wherever civilization extends. Mr. Bell was a professor at Boston\r\nUniversity and his honors came to him at an early age, for he was but\r\ntwenty-nine when the patent that was to make him famous was granted by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited his invention at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition\r\nwith but indifferent success; no attention was paid him until Dom\r\nPedro, Emperor of Brazil, a visitor at the fair, who knew the young\r\ninventor, placed the receiver to his ear while Professor Bell, in an\r\nadjoining room, spoke into it and, listening to it a moment, looked up\r\nwith the exclamation, “My God, it talks!” Recognition by the judges was\r\nthen hurriedly given and future success assured.\r\n\r\nThe fortieth anniversary of the award of this patent was fittingly\r\ncelebrated at the annual dinner of the National Geographic Society in\r\nWillards Hotel, Washington, D. C., March 7, 1916. The account of what\r\noccurred there, the splendid tributes paid to Professor Bell by the\r\ndistinguished men present, appears in the March number of the _National\r\nGeographic Magazine_, 1916, and presents a story of achievement of\r\nwhich every American can be justly proud, but is not a matter of pride\r\nto American genius alone, but shared alike wherever men do homage to\r\nintellectual worth and greatness.\r\n\r\nBut what of the future? Can the telephone be brought to still other\r\nuses than already known? Can it be made adaptable for field use, for\r\nrural purposes in the country districts of the United States? _The\r\nElectrical Experimenter_, for April, 1917, discusses a practical\r\npossibility in this direction, not for civil pursuits but for military\r\nneeds. It mentions a wireless telephone set, mounted on a motorcycle\r\nfor army purposes by means of radiophonic communication in connection\r\nwith a military aeroplane. This is of course intended for military\r\npurposes only, but shows the great possibilities involved and\r\nadvantages that may follow fuller investigation of wireless methods.\r\nAll questions of wireless development for military needs, however, may\r\nnow be safely left in the hands of those directly concerned. Perhaps\r\nthe greatest interest centers at present in its possibilities in the\r\nfield of the rural delivery service where its successful introduction\r\nwould work a most tremendous change. If, for instance, it could be\r\nused by a rural carrier, what a field of opportunity it would open in\r\nconnection with such service.\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility of such accomplishments? It would seem that\r\nthere is from the investigation and discovery of a young electrician,\r\nEarl Hanson, of Los Angeles, Cal. He recently demonstrated to the\r\nmayor of Los Angeles and the president of the telephone company\r\nthat his apparatus could send music, talk of any kind, whispers and\r\nsignals without wires. His device is so light and small and yet so\r\neffective that when attached to a bicycle used by a policeman, constant\r\ncommunication could be maintained with the laboratory. One or one\r\nthousand receivers can be attached, and each hears as distinctly as\r\nif they were in the room from which the sounds proceeded. The only\r\nexplanation of this marvelous process given is that the inventor used\r\nvery low frequency wireless waves in a new way. The great drawback to\r\nwireless telephony and telegraphy has always been that the air is one\r\ngreat “line” and always busy. Hanson’s plan aims to overcome this, to\r\nsend messages though the air is split up around him by the operation of\r\nother stations!\r\n\r\nAll this is wonderful and may require more demonstration to prove\r\nits adaptability, but science is at work and it is not improbable\r\nthat wireless telephones for rural use and purpose may ere long be\r\nsuccessfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Jasper, Fla., _News_, voices this prophetic hope in a well-written\r\narticle which recently appeared in that paper, and we take pleasure\r\nin presenting that portion herewith as a compliment to editorial\r\nenterprise and a far-seeing vision of coming events.\r\n\r\n “An improvement, which we confidently look forward to as being made in\r\n the not far distant future, will be the establishment of a wireless\r\n telephone system at every county seat in connection with the rural free\r\n delivery service.\r\n\r\n “By means of this wireless telephone, the carrier would be enabled to\r\n communicate with the post office from any point while serving his route,\r\n and the post office could call any carrier desired and deliver a message\r\n which the carrier would get without even stopping his automobile.\r\n\r\n “The advantage of an arrangement of this kind can be easily seen. The\r\n farmer could meet the mail at his number and over the wireless, could\r\n call a doctor, send a telegram, inquire about the market direct with\r\n the buyer, have Uncle Sam to run his errands, and many other things too\r\n numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n “Truly, we are living in a wonderful age, but more wonderful things are\r\n coming.”\r\n\r\n\r\nParcel Post Exhibits at County Fairs\r\n\r\nOne of the methods by which the Department is bringing the advantages\r\nof the parcel post to the attention of the people of the United\r\nStates is by means of exhibits at State and county fairs and other\r\ncivic expositions. While there is no appropriation available for such\r\npurpose, postmasters who are interested in this government experiment\r\nto bring producer and consumer together and so reduce the cost of\r\nliving expense have shown such desire to aid in this matter and their\r\nefforts have been so generally successful in this direction that\r\nspace has been freely given and great benefits have followed in all\r\ncommunities where this plan has been tried.\r\n\r\nFrom reports at hand it appears that ninety-four of such displays have\r\nbeen held in various States and that thirty additional fairs were\r\nyet to be held at which such parcel post exhibits were to be made a\r\nspecial feature. By tens of thousands, both city and rural populations\r\nhave been afforded an opportunity to see working demonstrations of the\r\nfarm-to-table service and been enabled to profit thereby.\r\n\r\nThese exhibits are generally so instructive to the people, the farmers\r\nso willing to show by card or samples of goods what they can furnish,\r\nand the postmasters so ready to cooperate in every way to make these\r\npostal exhibits a success by showing different styles of containers,\r\nthe best method of packing, etc., that no opportunity should be lost\r\nwhere county fairs are held to secure space for such exhibits and\r\nmake the most creditable display possible. The postmasters are the\r\nproper parties for carrying out the purposes of the Government in this\r\nconnection and the Department is anxious that such opportunities be\r\navailed of that the advantages thus offered may be utilized to their\r\nfullest extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Express Service of the Government\r\n\r\nThe parcel post, the great express service of the Government, is now\r\nused so generally and for so many purposes that the mention of some of\r\nthe things that are being shipped may be of interest. For instance,\r\nat the Lincoln County fair at Merrill, Wis., some time ago, there was\r\nan exhibit of a take-down house all the parts of which had been sent\r\nto Merrill by parcel post. Indeed the shipment of lumber by parcel\r\npost is not now an uncommon thing, due attention being paid to postal\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nAt Gridley, Cal., a patron entered the office with several small sacks\r\nof some heavy material and asked to have them forwarded. The clerk\r\nafter weighing them regarded the sacks with some suspicion and upon\r\ninquiry of the shipper learned that the sacks contained dirt, soil from\r\na farm, which he was sending to the State University for analysis.\r\nAnother patron appeared at the office in the morning with a package of\r\nmeat under his arm and posted the parcel to a family in Marysville,\r\nCal., remarking at the time that Mrs.---- ordered this meat for supper!\r\n\r\nAn enterprising farmer at Burke, Va., advises the Postmaster at\r\nWashington, D. C., that he would kill a steer on December 1, and would\r\nsell the cuts of meat at one-third less than Washington retail prices.\r\nHis offer was advertised in a farm list and in a parcel post trade\r\npaper and before the steer was killed the meat had all been engaged.\r\nThe cuts were sent to the customers in market baskets and containers.\r\nThe farmer was offered $35 for the steer on the hoof, but realized $45\r\nby individual sales and the hide paid for help in parting and dressing\r\nfor market. Orders came from Washington, Baltimore, and even from Long\r\nIsland, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster of Denver, Colo., reported that on Thanksgiving Day,\r\n1914, more than 1,000 perishable parcels, 80 per cent of which\r\ncontained turkeys, were received at the Denver office and delivered in\r\ngood condition.\r\n\r\nThe list of possible shipments of every conceivable kind and character\r\ncould be indefinitely extended, for it is known that the scope of\r\nsubjects that can be handled by the parcel post is practically\r\nlimitless and only awaits proper enterprise for productive profit to\r\nthose who will engage in it.\r\n\r\nThe parcel post is without question a great success. There is no other\r\nmeasure of interest connected with the service which presents so many\r\neconomic possibilities. Its great advantage over the private carriers\r\nis apparent and the benefits quickly seen in practical operation. The\r\nUnited States mail goes everywhere throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe country. Private expresses are governed by the avenues of profit.\r\nThe Government is not concerned about profit but regards service as of\r\nparamount importance, hence it directs its activities to all regions\r\nalike, going where there are no express offices or ever likely to be.\r\nThis is the great distinguishing feature of the parcel post and its\r\nbenefits as can be plainly seen, are chiefly for the rural sections\r\nwho would be denied these advantages were there no such service in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe whole effort of the parcel post aims to furnish an exceedingly\r\nreasonable method of interchanging commodities between the farm and\r\ncity home, something which no private corporation has ever attempted or\r\nwould undertake to do, all such enterprises being purely for gain and\r\nprofit. The farmer can now find the opportunity he has been seeking. By\r\nsome little care and attention to the conditions that assure favorable\r\nresults, such as putting himself in touch with his customers, properly\r\npacking and furnishing a good article at a reasonable price, he can\r\ndevelop a profitable market for what he produces, reduce the cost of\r\nliving to others while reaping an advantage for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Telephone and Parcel Post in Cooperation\r\n\r\nElsewhere attention is called to the future possibilities of the\r\nwireless telephone for rural uses, but in the meanwhile the many uses\r\nto which the telephone can be put in the common affairs of life is\r\nbeing industriously employed in all the rural sections of the country.\r\nThe farmers have learned to make daily use of this convenience and it\r\nis doubtless employed to almost as great an extent there as in the\r\ncities and commercial centers. The farmers wife can talk to the village\r\nstore, or the more ambitious establishments at the county seat, or\r\nperhaps reach a neighboring city for her wants, and Uncle Sam is so\r\nanxious to oblige her and has made such ample provision for the purpose\r\nthat her wants can receive instant attention and be promptly supplied,\r\na matter gratifying alike to the customer and the merchant as well.\r\n\r\nIt was altogether different before these conveniences were available.\r\nIt probably meant in those days a visit to the city or town, or if\r\nthe need was not pressing the friendly aid of neighborly interest and\r\nconcerns in seeing her wants supplied. In the hurry and rush of modern\r\nlife taking everything for granted and considering nothing uncommon, we\r\nare apt to pay little heed to the many comforts we now enjoy, and of\r\nwhich this Government provision for speedily supplying our wants and\r\nneeds forms no inconsiderable part.\r\n\r\nThe local merchant also comes in for his share of advantage to which\r\nthe telephone and parcel post so greatly contribute. The scope of his\r\npatronage is now broadened and enlarged. One hundred and fifty miles\r\nof territory have been added to and is now tributary to the field of\r\nhis industrial enterprise, and he can fairly compete with mail order\r\nhouses by the lower rates of postage within this zone--quite an item in\r\nhis favor--for it is practically a rate of 1 cent a pound or but little\r\nmore, which with some business ability and advertising push will give\r\nhim a field of opportunity wherein he can enter with every prospect of\r\nat least an equal chance with any of his competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining Public Officials\r\n\r\nThe following editorial article from the Washington, D. C., _Post_,\r\nwhile not relating to postal affairs particularly but treating of\r\nthe public service generally, has yet its peculiar significance to\r\npostal affairs as 80 per cent of all public employees are in some way\r\nconnected with the postal service. This very thoughtful and clearly\r\nexpressed editorial contains so much of value upon a subject to which\r\nbut little attention has been given, that the matter may well occupy\r\na share of public concern in a country such as ours where so large a\r\nproportion of its people occupy public position.\r\n\r\nThe _Post_ says:\r\n\r\n There has been a steady increase in the number and variety of Government\r\n activities. As industry has become more complex more Government\r\n agencies have been created for the purpose of regulation and control.\r\n Unfortunately, improvement in methods has not kept pace with the\r\n addition of new agencies.\r\n\r\n Touching upon this condition, Prof. Charles A. Beard, of Columbia\r\n University, supervisor of the training school for public service,\r\n recently asked:\r\n\r\n “How can we educate the public up to an appreciation of the necessity\r\n for trained and expert service in every branch of the Government? How\r\n can we order our public service so that it will attract the ablest men\r\n and women and guarantee progressive careers to those who prove loyal and\r\n efficient? How can we develop our civil service commissions into genuine\r\n recruiting agencies capable of supplying the Government with exactly the\r\n type of service needed for any given movement and of maintaining a loyal\r\n and efficient personnel?”\r\n\r\n If promotions were more certain in the Government service there would\r\n be no dearth of competent men to fill the places higher up. To solve\r\n this particular phase of the problem, however, it will be necessary to\r\n have the Government pay higher salaries. Better pay is now available\r\n in private industry than in the public service, and the Government has\r\n not yet reached the point where there is any general realization of the\r\n sound principle that it is better in the long run to pay high salaries\r\n to efficient men than to employ mediocre men at smaller salaries.\r\n\r\n The universities and colleges can do their part in training young men\r\n who seek elective offices, but a man well trained for office might lack\r\n the qualities which make for political success. Many foreign cities are\r\n run by experts. A large city frequently hires its chief executive from\r\n some neighboring town. A competent manager in a small city knows that\r\n he has an excellent chance of attracting attention by good work and\r\n getting a promotion. This system has been tried out in a small way in\r\n the United States, where a number of cities have hired managers to take\r\n full charge, with indifferent results. While progress toward efficiency\r\n is apt to be slow, the increased discussion of the problem is certain to\r\n bear good results eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Benefit of the Fourth Class Postmaster\r\n\r\nWhile the public concern has received the utmost attention, there are,\r\nhowever, some questions of interest affecting the welfare of postal\r\nemployees which should be given consideration. It is but common justice\r\nto consider the present method of payment to fourth-class postmasters,\r\nfor it allows them but small returns for their labor. If the same high\r\nstandard of efficiency is expected of them which should obtain in the\r\nservice generally, they should have their labor properly compensated.\r\nAt present the law restricts the salaries to be paid according to the\r\nvolume of outgoing mail at their office. The rural carrier who works\r\nunder the postmaster is under no such restrictions, is better paid,\r\nand has more holiday privileges. The fourth-class postmaster may have\r\nto work half days on holidays and Sundays and has no leave of absence.\r\nThe rural carrier has both. The position of postmaster may therefore\r\nbe said to be less desirable than that of the carrier, though his\r\nofficial responsibility from the nature of his duties is greater. At\r\nthe recent State convention of third and fourth-class postmasters,\r\nheld at Sunbury, Pa., the question was brought up and a reform urged\r\nin the matter. There is much to be said in favor of a more equitable\r\nadjustment, and the subject can be approached without detriment to the\r\ncarrier by a wider and more comprehensive view of the duties of the\r\npostmaster and a corresponding improvement in the method of payment.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the parcel post as a great common carrier is\r\nan added feature in connection with this subject. The fourth-class\r\npostmaster receives much more mail than he sends out. This inequality\r\nwhich affects his pay can be largely corrected if the postmasters in\r\ncities would adopt some practical measures towards stimulating orders\r\nfrom city patrons for farm produce which could be shipped by mail.\r\nThe organic act passed by Congress contemplated such advantageous\r\ninterchange for the benefit of the fourth-class postmaster as well\r\nas the city consumer, and a steady and persistent effort in that\r\ndirection by the city postmasters would greatly assist in carrying\r\nout the intention of Congress in this respect and popularize the plan\r\nin the rural sections by the reciprocal advantages it would confer.\r\nThe fourth-class postmaster could, however, greatly benefit himself,\r\neven under present methods, by making an earnest and industrious\r\neffort to develop the parcel post idea in his community, embracing the\r\nopportunities of his official relation to the service by encouraging\r\nand taking an active part in every detail of postal management, of\r\nwhich, just now, the parcel post is so conspicuous a feature and\r\nwhose more extended use among the people would so greatly advance his\r\nofficial as well as his personal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Work and Private Control\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asked why the Post Office Department cannot be managed\r\nas if it were in the hands of a private corporation. Many reasons might\r\nbe given, but a few will serve to explain the difference and perhaps\r\nenlighten the public who may expect more than the Department can\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the service is throughout closely controlled by\r\nCongress through its committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, and no\r\nimportant variations in the system or the methods of administration\r\ncan be initiated without their concurrence, and even if any particular\r\nor significant change is proposed by such committee, it is not always\r\npossible to obtain full congressional consent. Differences between the\r\nadministrative heads of the Department and Congress as to the necessity\r\nor advantage of certain plans or methods, are not uncommon, especially\r\nwhen any proposed changes antagonize existing usage or clash with\r\nparty policy or expediency. When proposed changes invade the domain\r\nwhere private enterprise has interests more or less valuable already\r\nestablished, influence may be brought to bear to counteract the reforms\r\nproposed, based on honest grounds of dissent as to the real benefit\r\nor practical advantage to be gained by the adoption of such measures.\r\nUnless it can then be shown that public interests would be benefited by\r\nthe changes proposed, the Department might have difficulty to overcome\r\nthis opposition.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, corporate control moves within narrower limits and\r\nexercises its power in more direct fashion. In theory a corporation is\r\ncomposed of its stockholders, a majority of whom nominate the board of\r\ndirectors. This board in turn appoints the permanent officials and they\r\nexercise full control in operation. Wide powers are given to these men\r\nand the policies advanced for extending influence and gaining profit\r\nare generally adopted. It is quite different dealing with Congress.\r\nNew policies are not always accepted, sometimes rejected or ignored.\r\nIt therefore follows that private concerns, having a freer hand and\r\nno complicated management to contend with, can institute experiments\r\nand try methods, and if well conceived, obtain results which a more\r\nrestricted authority could only perhaps with difficulty secure.\r\n\r\nA striking contrast between public and private control is seen in\r\nthe appropriation system by which the Departments are governed.\r\nAside from the difficulty often experienced in securing additional\r\nhelp when required, which would be readily given in great private\r\nconcerns because of expected advantages to follow, Department needs\r\nare sometimes left unsupplied and the dispatch of business hindered by\r\ndelay in this respect, or in the installation of mechanical appliances\r\nso generally used now, and which have in recent years to a very large\r\nextent, taken the place of human agencies in the business world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the greatest difficulties which obtains in public work\r\naside from what has been already mentioned and which has hampered more\r\nrapid progress in the Post Office Department, was the tendency and\r\npractice to adhere to old-established rules and precedents. These lax\r\nmethods, which were particularly apparent in the business customs and\r\nofficial procedure of the Department, were so firmly imbedded in its\r\nofficial life that it required a firm hand and a positive purpose to\r\ndislodge them. The present Postmaster General had both the courage and\r\nthe desire to sweep away these relics of a bygone period and substitute\r\nnewer and more suitable methods to meet progressive conditions and the\r\nDepartment is now conducted as it should be, and public complaints\r\ncaused by these obsolete and unsuitable measures is now largely avoided.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things that confront and have confronted the\r\nDepartment in its efforts towards greater efficiency. Conditions must\r\nbe taken into account and understood. The Department must always be a\r\npublic function and under Government control and be conducted, more\r\nor less, according to public usage. While red-tape rules and customs\r\nwill to some extent remain, great progress has been made in many\r\ndirections and public methods, by skilful management, brought nearer\r\nto the successes of business life, and the time is near at hand when\r\nthe answer to the interrogatory first propounded, may be made in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting the Public Records\r\n\r\nAmong the many useful and necessary reforms accomplished by the\r\nPostmaster General may be mentioned the institution of a hall of\r\nrecords for the protection of the files and valuable papers which\r\nbelong to the Department. These records contain the history of postal\r\nadministration from the beginning and deserve the most careful\r\nattention, not only on account of their sentimental but their\r\nhistorical value as well. The rise and progress of this index to our\r\ndeveloping greatness in postal progress from the days of Benjamin\r\nFranklin to our own times, is recorded in the volumes which form the\r\ngreat official library of the Department. The opinions, acts and State\r\npapers of every Postmaster General are found here and a complete\r\nhistory of the whole postal administration could be compiled from these\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of some surprise that preceding administrations paid so\r\nlittle attention to the care and proper housing of these valuable files\r\nand papers. For years they were stored in the garrets and attic of the\r\nold Post Office Building, inconvenient of access, and so limited in\r\nspace that any semblance of order was next to impossible. Lying there\r\nfor years practically undisturbed, a prey to the ravages of dust and\r\ndecay, it is a wonder that they are in any condition of preservation\r\nwhatever. The traces of neglect and ill-usage has left its marks\r\nvisibly upon these old volumes, and but for the quality of the material\r\nthen used and the care in binding then demanded for public documents,\r\nthey would be of but little service now.\r\n\r\nTo Postmaster General Burleson belongs the credit of rescuing these\r\nvaluable archives of his Department from ultimate destruction.\r\nSpace was found on the first floor of the building for storage and\r\narrangement. A force of clerks from each Bureau was detailed for this\r\nwork. The books and papers were removed from the nooks and corners to\r\nwhich they were relegated and under careful supervision located in the\r\nplace provided for them. Accumulations of dust brushed off, bundles\r\nof documents neatly arranged and tied anew, frayed edges and loosened\r\ncovers attended to, and the more important historical records set\r\napart for rebinding when necessary. Protected now from danger, easy of\r\naccess and convenient for reference, with space and light to assist\r\nin general preservation, these records can now be readily consulted,\r\ntime is saved in search and conditions in every way made serviceable\r\nand satisfactory. With an elaborate and carefully devised system of\r\nindexing, this official record is perhaps the most complete of any of\r\nthe Departments of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistry, Insurance, and Collect-on-Delivery Services for the Fiscal\r\nYear 1916\r\n\r\nThe number of pieces of mail registered, insured, and sent collect on\r\ndelivery during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1916, is shown in the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n            _Registered_                          1916\r\n  Paid registrations:\r\n      Domestic letters and parcels               29,091,506\r\n      Foreign letters and parcels                 5,179,325\r\n                                                 ----------\r\n      Total paid registrations                   34,270,831\r\n  Free registrations--official                    4,965,738\r\n                                                 ----------\r\n      Total paid and free                        39,236,569\r\n\r\n  Amount collected for registry fees          $3,427,083.10\r\n\r\n            _Insured_\r\n  Fourth-class (domestic parcel post):\r\n      Total pieces insured (3-, 5-, 10-,\r\n        and 25-cent fees)                         24,936,082\r\n      Total fees                               $1,067,192.29\r\n\r\n            _Collect on Delivery_\r\n  Fourth-class (domestic parcel post) pieces       6,300,546\r\n      Fees                                       $630,054.60\r\n\r\n\r\nReadjustment of Rate for Second-Class Mail\r\n\r\nOne of the vexatious problems with which the Department has to deal is\r\nthat relating to second-class mail matter which costs the Government\r\nseveral times over what is received therefrom in the way of revenue.\r\nIn March, of 1911, Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing\r\nthe appointment of a commission to investigate the subject and make\r\na report thereon. The president selected Mr. Justice Hughes, of the\r\nSupreme Court, President Lowell, of Harvard University, and Mr.\r\nHarry A. Wheeler, of Chicago. This commission found that the cost to\r\nthe Government of handling and transporting this mail was about 6\r\ncents a pound for which the Government received but 1 cent a pound.\r\nThe Department recommended an increase to 2 cents a pound which was\r\napproved by the commission. February 22, 1912, the report was submitted\r\nto Congress by the President, who urged favorable consideration, but\r\nso far no action has been taken. Suggestions as to desirable changes\r\nin relation to second-class mail matter have been made to Congress\r\nby Postmaster General Burleson, in which several ideas as to a more\r\nequitable arrangement were proposed, by which the Government would get\r\na compensation more nearly in accord with the expense of this service,\r\nbut without result, and the whole subject remains undisposed of with\r\nthe prevailing rate still in force. This class of mail increased\r\n93,184,891 pounds over that of the year 1915, notwithstanding the\r\nhigher cost of paper and material. The readjustment of rates is held\r\nto be necessary in view of the disproportion of revenue to the cost of\r\nhandling and transportation.\r\n\r\nPostmaster General Charles Emory Smith in his annual report to Congress\r\nin 1900, referring to the cost of carrying second-class mail matter as\r\nhindering the progress of rural delivery extension, said:\r\n\r\n “In my last annual report it was shown that if a class of publications\r\n which now, under an evasion of the purpose of the law, pay the\r\n second-class rate of postage, were really made to pay the third-class\r\n rate, as they ought to do, it would bring an additional revenue to the\r\n Government of $12,343,612. This amount is lost through an abuse that can\r\n be and ought to be rectified. It is a public contribution without any\r\n public advantage for the sole benefit of a few private interests.... If\r\n it is a question between favoring a very limited number of publishers\r\n and favoring twenty-one millions of people who live on the farms of\r\n the United States, there ought to be no hesitation in serving the\r\n many rather than the few. The abuse should be uprooted as a public\r\n duty, the national delivery service should be undertaken as a public\r\n policy, and when through the overthrow of the wrong the right can be\r\n established without the slightest additional burden, the appeal becomes\r\n irresistible.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPeculiar Customs of European Rural Delivery\r\n\r\nSome years ago at the request of Postmaster General Gary, the Secretary\r\nof State addressed a letter to each of our ambassadors and ministers\r\nin Europe, asking for information touching the extent and character\r\nof rural delivery in the countries to which they were accredited. In\r\nthe answers received it was shown, for example, that in Great Britain\r\nthere was substantially a house-to-house rural delivery, only the most\r\ninaccessible domiciles being left unvisited. The English rural postman,\r\ntraveling chiefly on foot, walks from 15 to 18 miles a day, for an\r\naverage pay of 18 shillings, or $4.50 a week. A paternal government\r\nprovides him with a uniform, gives him $5 a year to buy shoes,\r\nfurnishes him medical attendance when sick, and permits him to retire\r\non a small pension after ten years of faithful service.\r\n\r\nIn France rural carriers, who also travel on foot, are paid a mileage\r\nof 7¼ centimes a kilometer, or not quite 2½ cents a mile, for the\r\ndistance they cover. The average length of a route is from 10 to 15\r\nmiles, and they are required to cover it every day in the year, Sunday\r\nincluded. They receive an allowance for clothing, and may retire on a\r\npension at the end of fifteen years. The service extends into every\r\ncommune, and practically all France is covered by rural free delivery.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the delivery of mails in remote rural districts is not\r\nexactly free. Extra postage is charged, part of which goes to the\r\ncarrier and part to the government. The pay of carriers, outside\r\nof this allowance, is from 700 to 900 marks a year, with 100 marks\r\nadditional for house rent (a German mark being equivalent to 24 cents\r\nof our money).\r\n\r\nIn Austria-Hungary the rural carrier is hired by the postmaster of the\r\nlocal office to which he is attached and paid by him. He is authorized\r\nto collect a fee of half a cent on all letters and an eighth of a cent\r\non all newspapers delivered by him. His average pay is about $120 a\r\nyear. To earn this sum he travels 10 miles a day, always on foot.\r\nBefore he can enter upon his duties he has to make a deposit of $80\r\n(or two-thirds of a year’s salary) with the postmaster as security for\r\ncarrying out his contract.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian rural carrier makes a daily round trip of 15 or 16 miles on\r\nfoot, and is paid a salary which varies according to the supposed cost\r\nof living in the district where he serves, but which seldom exceeds\r\n$250 a year. He is denied the right to vote, and prohibited from taking\r\npart in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Was a Newspaper? Act of 1825\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Postmaster General Wickliffe of Kentucky\r\nthe question was raised what in the meaning of the postal law, Act of\r\n1825, constitutes a newspaper. _The Shipping and Commercial List_ and\r\n_New York Price Current_ claimed that it was a newspaper and entitled\r\nto the newspaper rate. It had been so regarded prior to 1837, but\r\nafterwards as subject to letter postage. The Postmaster General wanted\r\nlight upon the subject and the question was submitted to the Attorney\r\nGeneral, Hon. H. S. Legare for an opinion. As his spirited reply may\r\ninterest newspaper men of today as well as others, the principal parts\r\nof the opinion are subjoined:\r\n\r\n “The only light, a very uncertain one, is the use of the word,\r\n ‘newspaper’ in common parlance or in the English Stamp Acts. According\r\n to the statute it must be (1) periodically published; (2) at intervals\r\n not exceeding two days; (3) must contain public news or remarks thereon;\r\n (4) that it contain not more than two sheets. Thus it may be admitted\r\n that the paper must be published at short intervals, but what is a short\r\n interval? There are many weekly newspapers, why not monthly? It may be\r\n doubted whether the intervals need be exactly stated. The passing events\r\n may be diversified according to the tastes, the fancies, the wants or\r\n convenience of mankind. The monthly catalogue of new publications will\r\n be of interest to a scholar, proceedings of tribunals to a lawyer,\r\n theaters or new fashions in dress to the idle and the gay, etc.,\r\n bulletins of battles to a soldier, price currents to a merchant, etc. A\r\n newspaper is more likely to please a majority of readers which meets all\r\n tastes. Why should a devout man be annoyed by puffs of opera dancers,\r\n members of a total abstinence society with tempting sales of wines and\r\n liquors, a plodding man of business with dissertations on books, or a\r\n bookish man with columns of business advertisements?”\r\n\r\nThe decision states in conclusion that “_The Shipping and Commercial\r\nList_ to be treated as a newspaper must be sent open and without any\r\nwritten signature or note.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen in the Post Office Department\r\n\r\nThe women of the United States owe an everlasting debt of gratitude\r\nto Frances E. Spinner for opening to them the door of opportunity for\r\nemployment in the public service. Salmon P. Chase was Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury in the administration of President Lincoln and General\r\nSpinner was the Treasurer of the United States. Many of the clerks of\r\nthe Treasury had joined the army, and General Spinner suggested to the\r\nSecretary the employment of women in their stead. Though his suggestion\r\nmet with considerable opposition at the time, the wishes of General\r\nSpinner finally prevailed, and Secretary Chase gave his consent to the\r\nappointment of women, and the avenues of public employment were opened\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSince that time the employment of women in the public service has\r\nbecome general, and they may now be found in all the Departments, in\r\npost offices and as mail carriers on the post roads of the United\r\nStates. The most recent register of employees in the Post Office\r\nDepartment shows that it had upon its pay rolls for the Department\r\nproper, sixty-two women receiving $1,200 per annum, thirty-two at\r\n$1,400 per annum, ten at $1,600 per annum, three at $1,800, forty-three\r\nat $1,000 per annum, besides many more at lesser salaries. The act of\r\nGeneral Spinner in opening the door of the public service to women\r\ndoubtless had its general effect in private employment as well, for\r\nfrom the close of the Civil War the entrance of women into the business\r\nrelations of the country may be safely dated.\r\n\r\nMany of the women in the Departments occupy positions of responsibility\r\nand importance, and fill such positions with credit to themselves and\r\nthe service as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailroad Accidents and the Construction of Mail Cars\r\n\r\nThere were 163 railroad accidents during the fiscal year, 1916, of\r\nwhich 155 resulted in injuries to clerks, and eight, exclusive of those\r\nin which clerks were injured, resulted in loss or damage to mail.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the kind and construction of the mail cars in\r\nwhich accidents to clerks occurred:\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------+----------+---------+---------\r\n  Kind of car| Number   | Number| Clerks  | Clerks   | Clerks  | Total\r\n             | of cars  | of    | killed  | seriously| slightly| clerks\r\n             | in       | clerks| or died | injured  | injured | injured\r\n             | accidents| in    |   as    | in these | in these|   and\r\n             |          | these | result  |  cars    |   cars  | killed\r\n             |          | cars  |   of    |          |         | in these\r\n             |          |       | injuries|          |         |  cars\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------+----------+---------+---------\r\n  Wood       |    57    |   76  |    1    |    18    |    42   |    61\r\n  Wood-steel |          |       |         |          |         |\r\n   reenforced|    18    |   25  |         |    12    |     9   |    21\r\n  Steel      |    67    |  258  |    1    |    28    |    86   |   115\r\n  Steel      |          |       |         |          |         |\r\n   underframe|    22    |   57  |         |     9    |    21   |    30\r\n             +----------+-------+---------+----------+---------+---------\r\n  Total      |   164    |  416  |    2    |    67    |   158   |   227\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------+----------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Ownership of Postal Telegraphs and Telephones\r\n\r\nOpinion of Postmaster General Burleson\r\n\r\nPostmaster General Burleson, in his annual report to Congress for 1916,\r\nmade the following statement regarding Postal Telegraphs and Telephones:\r\n\r\n“As the former reports pointed out, the private ownership of telephone\r\nand telegraph utilities places in private hands the control of\r\nimportant vehicles for the transmission of intelligence, and therefore\r\ninfringes upon a function reserved by the Constitution to the National\r\nGovernment. Operation of these facilities inherently as well as\r\nconstitutionally belongs to the Postal Service. Attention again is\r\ncalled to the legal precedents and the attitude of former postmasters\r\ngeneral, as briefly stated in my report for 1914:\r\n\r\n“That it has been the policy of this Government to ultimately acquire\r\nand operate these electrical means of communication as postal\r\nfacilities, as is done by all the principal nations, the United States\r\nalone excepted, is evidenced by the fact that the first telegraph line\r\nin this country was maintained and operated as a part of the Postal\r\nService, and further by the Act of July 24, 1866, which provided for\r\nthe Government acquisition of the telegraph lines upon the payment of\r\nan appraised valuation, and again by the act of 1902, which directed\r\nthe Postmaster General ‘to report to Congress the probable cost of\r\nconnecting a telegraph and telephone system with the Postal Service by\r\nsome feasible plan.’\r\n\r\n“‘It is an interesting fact that, whereas policies of Government have\r\nbeen advocated and some adopted, the constitutionality of which have\r\nbeen seriously questioned, the principle of Government ownership and\r\ncontrol of the telegraph and telephone finds its greatest strength\r\nin the Constitution. This opinion has been shared by practically all\r\nPostmasters General of the United States, who have held that the\r\nwelfare and happiness of the nation depend upon the fullest utilization\r\nof these agencies by the people, which can only be accomplished through\r\nGovernment ownership.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquor Carried by the Mails\r\n\r\nIn view of the rapid spread of prohibition sentiment in the country\r\nduring the past few years, it may be of interest to know that the\r\nactivities then already apparent to check in every possible way\r\nconvenient access to this demoralizing evil, found in a limited sense\r\nthe aid and support of the Post Office Department.\r\n\r\nThere was a growing suspicion that traffic in the carrying of liquor\r\nfrom one point to another on the lines of the star-route service\r\nby carriers was being conducted, and this suspicion afterwards\r\ndeveloped into loud and persistent complaints which finally reached\r\nthe Department and attracted official attention. It was stated that\r\nliquor was being conveyed by these carriers to points in local option\r\nterritory and even distributed among the Indians, a practice which the\r\nGovernment was particularly anxious to prevent. The matter was finally\r\nbrought to the attention of Postmaster General Von Meyer who at once\r\ntook steps to interfere with this traffic. After some consultation as\r\nto the best means of stamping out this evil, a clause was inserted\r\nin the advertisement for star-route service and later embodied in\r\nevery contract upon which awards were made. This statement says: “It\r\nis further agreed that the contractor or carrier shall not transport\r\nintoxicating liquor from one point to another on this route while in\r\nthe performance of mail service.”\r\n\r\nThis positive Governmental interference with the traffic in liquor by\r\nmeans of the mails may not be generally known, and it is mentioned here\r\nthat credit might be given to Postmaster General Von Meyer for an act\r\nwhich destroyed a growing evil, covertly conducted, and put a stop to a\r\npractice which was doing damage in a great many sections.\r\n\r\nBy Act approved March 3, 1917, providing for appropriations for the\r\nPost Office, no letter, postal card, circular, newspaper, etc.,\r\ncontaining any advertisement of spirituous, vinuous, malted, fermented\r\nor other intoxicating liquor of any kind, or containing a solicitation\r\nof an order for said liquors, shall be deposited in or carried by\r\nthe mails of the United States, or be delivered by any postmaster or\r\nletter carrier addressed and directed to any person, firm, corporation\r\nor association at any place or point in any State or territory of the\r\nUnited States, at which it is by the law in force in such State and\r\nTerritory at that time unlawful to advertise or solicit orders for such\r\nliquors or any of them respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Post Office Department Helps the Farmer\r\n\r\nOf all the great Executive Departments, the Post Office comes closest\r\nto the people and is of particular interest to the farmer living\r\naway from the great avenues of postal service supply. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral, from his service in Congress, where the needs of the farmer\r\nare known, coupled with the opportunities of his present position,\r\nwas able to render him a great service, and that he has done so, that\r\nhis administration has shown his successful efforts in this direction\r\ncannot be questioned nor denied.\r\n\r\nThe Parcel Post with all its beneficent possibilities and advantages\r\nreceived early consideration. It meant so much to the farmer that\r\nzealous and persistent attention was wisely directed to obtain the\r\nutmost that could be accomplished. Weight limits were extended,\r\npostage reduced by zone expansion, and the project put upon such\r\npractical basis that great benefits are already assured and further\r\nprogress only waits legislative sanction. City and country are now\r\nbrought together. Suburban express, the result of motor service, gives\r\nthe farmer an easily reached and remunerative market and the consumer\r\nfinds upon his daily table the fresh products which this rapid means of\r\ncommunication from the farm can so readily supply. The Parcel Post is\r\none of the most popular measures of this administration and everything\r\npossible has been done to foster and perfect it.\r\n\r\nThe Rural Free Delivery with its millions of patrons, of which over\r\n650,000 were added within the past three years, tells the story of\r\nadministrative accomplishment. The great success of rural delivery is\r\npeculiarly the farmers triumph. He is now on a par with his neighbor in\r\nthe cities in all that enterprising postal service can give. Taken both\r\ntogether, the widely admitted success of the Parcel Post as well as\r\nthe rural delivery, a chapter of achievement has been written of which\r\nthe Department is justly proud and against which criticism can find no\r\nground for righteous complaint.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that this administration has done for the man in\r\nthe country. The energetic application of the experimental legislation\r\nappropriating $500,000 for participation in the construction of\r\nimproved highways has brought forth an additional appropriation of\r\n$75,000,000, which will be expended by the Federal Government, in\r\ncooperation with the States, for the improvement of roads over which\r\nmail delivery is performed, or on which it may be located hereafter.\r\nThe Rural Credit and Good Roads bills are subjects of profound\r\ninterest which even partisan prejudice cannot minimize or obscure.\r\nThe tremendous advantage which these two great measures afford the\r\nfarmer will be readily admitted and recognized when seen in practical\r\noperation. The need of such beneficent help has long been felt and\r\nthese two bills should make the lot of the farmers much easier. They\r\nhave been getting reasonably good prices for their products and are\r\ngenerally prosperous, but the fact remains that but few hold their land\r\nfree of incumbrance. Complete ownership will now be possible. With\r\nfederal aid to road construction and this new rural credits law, it\r\nshould not be long until the greatest prosperity the country sections\r\nhave ever known should be an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpediting the Mail on Star Routes\r\n\r\nAttention is called elsewhere to the benefit of motor vehicle service\r\nin rural delivery, and it is now proposed to introduce this advantage\r\nin the star-route service as well. Until a short while ago there was\r\nno authority for any particular form of conveyance to be used in this\r\nconnection. With the advent of automobiles and other motor vehicles, it\r\nbecame evident that great opportunities presented themselves by which\r\nthe transportation of mails on this class of routes could be measurably\r\nexpedited and during the present administration the law was so amended\r\nthat the mode of transportation could be specified.\r\n\r\nThe demand of the day is for the rapid conveyance of mails in every\r\ndirection and people are no longer satisfied to put up with the\r\npractices and methods of other days. That mails have been conveyed\r\nin this service with “due celerity, certainty and security” was not\r\nenough. Money is paid for service and the best that can be given is\r\nrequired. So it was decided to expedite star-route service. While there\r\nare a number of routes on which automobiles are now used in view of the\r\nprovision of law as covered by the order of the Postmaster General,\r\nAugust 14, 1916, amending section No. 1424 to correspond with the law\r\nas amended, steps are now being taken in connection with the award of\r\ncontracts for the four-year term beginning July 1, 1917, which includes\r\nthe contract section from Maine to West Virginia, to require the use of\r\nmotor vehicles wherever the importance of the route seemed to warrant\r\nand weather conditions would permit the use of such conveyance. One\r\nhundred and forty advertisements are now pending for such service in\r\nthis contract section.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a great accommodation for all routes where such\r\nservice can be employed and will give the people the best mail\r\nfacilities that can be devised. It will hasten the receipt and dispatch\r\nof mails by means of rural carrier connections, be of great advantage\r\nto the business men along such routes, expedite newspaper delivery and\r\nin many cases save twenty-four hours over the present method. Every\r\neffort will be made to introduce this more rapid service as quickly and\r\nwidely as the laws will permit. If it is found to work well in this\r\nfirst contract section where it is to be tried, it will be extended to\r\nothers in regular succession until the star-route service everywhere\r\nhas the benefit of this improved means of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln Postmaster in 1837\r\n\r\nSo much has been said and written about Abraham Lincoln that it would\r\nseem as if nothing new could be mentioned. In fact his history and\r\nbiography are as well known to the school children as that of George\r\nWashington, but it is probably not generally known to the postmasters\r\nof the country that he was at one time in the postal service as a\r\npostmaster, and in a book devoted entirely to postal affairs it may be\r\nof interest to state the fact that this additional incident in his life\r\nand public career may be added to what is already known.\r\n\r\nMr. T. H. Bartlett, in the Boston _Transcript_, says:\r\n\r\n It will interest Lincoln lovers to learn that, as far as known, probably\r\n the first time that Abraham Lincoln’s name was mentioned in print was in\r\n the United States Biennial Register for 1837. It was in the Post Office\r\n Department, as “Postmaster at New Salem, Ill., Abraham Lincoln, 1 quar.,\r\n 10-19-48.” The Register contained the names of every officer and employe\r\n for that year.\r\n\r\nSo people who keep scrap books in which to note peculiar events and\r\noccurrences in the lives of great men may add this little item to their\r\ncollection, for everything connected with the life of Abraham Lincoln\r\nis worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Central Accounting Office for Each County\r\n\r\nA very notable and far-reaching measure of public administration in the\r\nconduct of the Post Office Department was enacted in the past session\r\nof Congress by which, in order to promote economy in the distribution\r\nof supplies and in auditing and accounting, the Postmaster General was\r\nauthorized to designate districts and central offices in such districts\r\nthrough which supplies shall be distributed and accounts rendered. This\r\nmeans in other words that one postmaster in a county is hereafter to\r\ndistribute supplies for the other post offices and render an account\r\nto the auditor for all the offices in a certain county or district,\r\nthus simplifying the whole subject and placing the business involved\r\nat each of these offices under one central control. This is, however,\r\nnot to give such central office authority to abolish offices, to change\r\nofficers or employees in offices included in such district.\r\n\r\nThe law goes into effect July 1, 1917, and the Postmaster General will\r\nappoint a committee, of which the First Assistant Postmaster General\r\nwill probably be chairman, to establish the system and select the\r\ncentral office in each district or county to which the other offices\r\nare to report, and under whose general control this plan is to be\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillions of Money for Good Roads\r\n\r\nThat good roads are an important factor in the spread of civilization\r\nis a statement which no one will dispute. Imperial Rome in the zenith\r\nof its power perfectly understood this. The marvellous genius and\r\nindustry which constructed its great highways of commerce and travel,\r\nworks which have been the admiration of all succeeding ages, are yet\r\nsplendid even in their decaying greatness. Prescott, the historian,\r\nin his romantic history of Peru, tells of the wonderful engineering\r\nskill displayed in the reigns of the early Peruvian rulers in the\r\nbuilding of their great military roads, which served alike the purpose\r\nof a peaceful people as well as the rapid assembling of its armies for\r\nwarlike action. No nation now neglects this very important part of its\r\neconomic life, and the United States having become a power in universal\r\ncivilization is fully alive to all the measureless advantages which\r\ngood roads afford.\r\n\r\nMaterial prosperity waits upon road development and land values rise\r\nin proportion to road improvement. A few striking instances may be\r\nmentioned as illustrating this fact. _Wallace’s Farmer_ has stated that:\r\n\r\n“In Franklin County, New York, where 24 miles of good roads have been\r\nbuilt, eight pieces of land selected at random increased 27.8 per\r\ncent in value. In Lee County, Virginia, which built eighty-four miles\r\nof roads, land advanced 25 per cent in value. Spottsylvania County,\r\nin the same state, improved forty-one miles of roads, and the land\r\nadjoining sold for $44.75 where previous to the improvement it had been\r\nbought for just $20 less per acre. After Manatee County, Florida, had\r\nconstructed sixty-four miles of macadam and shell highway, the land\r\nalong the road increased more than $20 per acre in less than two years,\r\nand the land a mile away from the road showed an increase of $10 an\r\nacre. In Wood County, Ohio, where land has been drained and bounded by\r\nlimestone pikes, the values have risen from $70 to $250 per acre.”\r\n\r\nThe _New York Journal of Commerce_ says “there are few agencies that\r\nare so fruitful of economic good, social and political solidarity,\r\nand even national spirit.” The very great desire of the Post Office\r\nDepartment to extend and improve the rural delivery service is an ever\r\npresent argument in favor of good roads, without which no extensions\r\nor improvements are possible. The life of the country church, the\r\ncountry school, the whole question of intensive and scientific farming\r\nis involved in the subject of good roads, and in its wider and broader\r\naspect the question takes on a new and a very significient meaning.\r\nOriginally intended to promote and foster the arts of peace, military\r\nneeds now claim national attention. Quoting again from the _Journal of\r\nCommerce_: “Mobilization, defense, and the transportation of troops,\r\nmunitions, and supplies, are in a large part dependent upon an adequate\r\nsystem of highways, especially along the sea coasts and national\r\nborders. The experience of all the warring nations of Europe in the\r\npresent conflict, are ample proof of this. Only the future will show\r\nwhether or not these objects have been kept in view when the national\r\nappropriation is spent.”\r\n\r\nThe Government has set aside for the year ending June 30, 1919, the\r\nsum of $14,550,000 as an apportionment to the States to aid in the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of rural post roads in accordance with\r\nthe provision of the Federal aid roads law. $20,000,000 will be\r\napportioned for 1920, and $25,000,000 for 1921. This is the third\r\napportionment under the law, $4,850,000 having been apportioned for\r\n1917 and $9,700,000 for 1918. The Bureau of Public Roads states that\r\nthe expenditures for road and bridge building in the United States have\r\nincreased from about $80,000,000 a year in 1904 to $282,000,000 in\r\n1915, or more than 250 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese figures are as amazing as they are impressive, and they must\r\ncarry to the mind of the reader the solicitude of his government for\r\nall that makes for national prosperity and advancement. There was a\r\ntime when good roads were a luxury and only a few States in the East\r\npaid any attention to this question. With the advent of the automobile\r\ncame a great change. Rides for pleasure as well as for gainful pursuits\r\nrequired better conditions, and for both purposes good roads became\r\neverywhere a question of paramount importance. The farmer whose\r\nimproved surroundings permitted this now common luxury, wanted the\r\nbenefit of it, and the demand for better road conditions found its way\r\ninto the halls of legislation in the States, and in the Congress of\r\nthe Nation, and the answer to this demand upon the part of the Federal\r\ngovernment is the magnificent appropriation which is now available and\r\nto be expended for this far reaching purpose.\r\n\r\nRural delivery in which the rural resident is so greatly interested\r\nwill profit most by this liberal government provision, it being\r\noriginally intended for post road purposes, of which rural delivery\r\nis now the principal and most important part. The rural life of the\r\ncountry is to be bettered in every way by the spread of this means\r\nof postal communication. The Post Office Department is always ready\r\nto listen to every suggestion which makes for greater comfort and\r\nconvenience in this direction, and to act promptly when resulting\r\nadvantages can be shown. Therefore, the sections where rural delivery\r\nis not as fully introduced and developed as it might be, or inviting\r\nfields for exploration and administrative action are not yet reached,\r\nthe people for whose benefit this money is to be used should get\r\nin touch with the Department and bring to its attention whatever\r\ninformation upon the subject they may possess which might be fashioned\r\ninto useful results. The Department has many eyes but cannot see all\r\nand know all, and this is where outside assistance can be of great\r\nadvantage, and would be most gladly welcomed. Postal patrons are\r\nthe working partners of the Postmaster General in all that concerns\r\nthe improvement and extension of the service, and if they will take\r\nthe same active interest that he does and cooperate with the Fourth\r\nAssistant Postmaster General, in whose Bureau this rural delivery work\r\nis centered, great advances in all directions may be readily made.\r\n\r\n\r\n$14,550,000 for Rural Post Roads\r\n\r\nApportionment to the States from government funds to aid in the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of rural postroads in accordance with the\r\nFederal aid roads law for the year ending June 30, 1919, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Alabama         $313,456      Ohio             558,043\r\n  Arizona          205,540      Oklahoma         346,489\r\n  Arkansas         250,018      Oregon           236,332\r\n  California       456,167      Pennsylvania     690,145\r\n  Colorado         257,278      Idaho            182,471\r\n  Connecticut       92,216      Illinois         658,323\r\n  Delaware          24,411      Indiana          406,230\r\n  Florida          170,723      Iowa             434,653\r\n  Georgia          403,909      Kansas           429,131\r\n  Maryland         130,871      Kentucky         292,984\r\n  Massachusetts    221,261      Louisiana        203,755\r\n  Michigan         435,356      Maine            144,807\r\n  Minnesota        425,865      Rhode Island      34,972\r\n  Mississippi      268,751      South Carolina   215,014\r\n  Missouri         508,603      South Dakota     243,175\r\n  Montana          298,520      Tennessee        340,663\r\n  Nebraska         319,445      Texas            876,986\r\n  Nevada           193,229      Utah             170,763\r\n  New Hampshire     62,610      Vermont           68,128\r\n  New Jersey       177,357      Virginia         298,120\r\n  New Mexico       238,634      Washington       216,530\r\n  New York         749,674      West Virginia    159,713\r\n  North Carolina   342,556      Wisconsin        382,707\r\n  North Dakota     229,585      Wyoming          183,805\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Extensions by Air and Motor Truck Routes\r\n\r\nAs the result of a recent conference between Postmaster General\r\nBurleson and Secretary of War Baker, and with the approval of the\r\nPresident, Congress has been asked to authorize the Secretary of War\r\nto turn over to the Post Office Department all military aeroplanes and\r\nmotor vehicles not serviceable for military purposes, or which after\r\nthe war may be dispensed with for military service.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any aeroplanes are turned over to the Post Office\r\nDepartment, aeroplane mail routes will be established in the country,\r\nas they now are in Italy and France.\r\n\r\nItaly has an aerial mail route from her coast to Sardinia, and is able\r\nto deliver 500 pounds of mail in two hours. France has a similar aerial\r\nroute between her coast and Corsica.\r\n\r\nThe motor trucks procured from the War Department at this time or\r\nat the close of the war will be available for the parcel post truck\r\nservice. In the view of the Postmaster General, the operation of these\r\nmotor-truck routes would add 100 per cent to the value of the parcel\r\npost service in the vicinity of the cities where established.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living will be reduced, it is stated, by eliminating\r\nuseless and expensive operation in the postal means of communication\r\nbetween producer and consumer; will permit the producer to continue\r\nproduction and the labor incident thereto, instead of suspending\r\nproduction or labor while conveying produce to consumers, and will\r\nextend the postal zone of collection-and-delivery service in the\r\nvicinity of large cities to the point where the actual farmer-producer\r\nis domiciled rather than where only suburban residents and nonproducers\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCare Required in Preparing Contracts\r\n\r\nAmong the most important duties which a postmaster is called upon to\r\nperform is seeing that contracts for star-route service are properly\r\nfilled out before being sent to the department. These contracts are\r\nof a legal nature and while the necessary provisions are plainly\r\nstated and simple enough to be easily understood, extreme care must be\r\nexercised to see that the instructions are complied with. Spaces for\r\nthe signatures of the contractor, the sureties and witnesses properly\r\nfilled out, dates given, names plainly written wherever required and\r\nthe contractor should personally examine the contract to see that all\r\nthis is carefully done. Failure to note these necessary details causes\r\nthe return of the contract for correction, delaying its acceptance\r\nand imposing extra and unnecessary work upon the contract clerk. It\r\nmay also be stated that as failure to perform service on the part of\r\nthe contractor is liable to bring these contracts into courts of law\r\nfor judicial determination, it becomes of the highest importance that\r\nnothing required to be done is omitted in preparation and the contract\r\nbe correct in form and in every particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirthday of the American Postal Service\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of July, 1917, the postal service of the United\r\nStates can celebrate the one hundred and forty-third anniversary of\r\nits establishment. It was on July 26, 1775, nearly a year before the\r\nindependence of the colonies was proclaimed, that the freedom of postal\r\naffairs was made an accomplished fact. The British control had existed\r\nfor eighty-three years, from 1692 to 1775. There was only one line\r\nthen in existence along the coast with but few branches and those far\r\nbetween. This service was first managed by private interests under a\r\npatent from William and Mary, but afterwards directly by the English\r\ncrown. The fullness of time had at length arrived, had brought the\r\nauspicious day, and postal independence was born!\r\n\r\nPatriotic sentiment is not wanting in this country of ours, and the\r\nflag is ever the object of sincere and heartfelt devotion. The great\r\nstrides in postal development from that day to this should make the\r\npulse of every citizen, particularly every postal employe, great or\r\nsmall, quicken with civic pride as each successive anniversary of our\r\ngreat postal establishment brings the date to mind. Postmasters might\r\nwell signalize the day by conspicious display of the flag under which\r\nsuch tremendous progress has been made not only in postal affairs but\r\nin national greatness and glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Postmasters General\r\n\r\n  _Continental Congress_\r\n                       Benjamin Franklin,    Pennsylvania,  July 26, 1775\r\n                       Richard Bache,        Pennsylvania,  Nov. 7, 1776\r\n                       Ebenezer Hazard,      New York,      Jan. 28, 1782\r\n\r\n                                                               _Date of\r\n  _Presidents_       _Postmasters General_     _State_       Appointment_\r\n  Washington,          Samuel Osgood,        Massachusetts, Sept. 26, 1789\r\n      ”                Timothy Pickering,    Pennsylvania,  Aug. 12, 1791\r\n      ”                Joseph Habersham,     Georgia,       Feb. 25, 1795\r\n  Jefferson,           Gideon Granger,       Connecticut,   Nov. 28, 1801\r\n  Madison,             Return J.

The smaller post offices which\r\nreceive 65 per cent of the parcels, dispatch only 9½ per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe annual readjustment of the salaries of presidential postmasters,\r\nwill, according to the provisions in the postal appropriation bill\r\nfor 1917, be based on the gross receipts for the four quarters ending\r\nDecember 31, instead of March 31, as heretofore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEligibles for fourth-class postmaster places are selected in the order\r\nof their civil service rating unless good and sufficient reasons to the\r\ncontrary are submitted to the Department. Of 32,000 of such eligibles,\r\n89.5 of those whose names appeared first on the list were appointed. In\r\n8 per cent the second highest were selected, and in 2.5 per cent, the\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of postmasters in the United States are, according to\r\nclasses, 567 in the first, 2,211 in the second, 6,414 in the third, and\r\n46,742 in the fourth class. Total, 55,934.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCuster County, Montana, has one of the longest mail routes in the\r\nUnited States. This line runs from Miles City to Stacey, Olive,\r\nBroaddus, Boyer, Graham, and Biddle. It is said to be 126 miles long\r\nand some contend that it is longer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe longest star route in the United States is from Helper to Vernal,\r\nUtah, 116 miles, and the price the Government pays is $38,678.70 per\r\nannum. The longest route in Alaska, is overland, Barrow to Kotzbue, 650\r\nmiles. The shortest route is in Pennsylvania, from Keiser to Natalie,\r\n65/100. There is one route in New York, Delhi to Bloomville, 8 miles\r\nand back, twelve times a week, for which the contractor receives but 1\r\ncent per annum, no doubt considering the advantage of carrying the mail\r\nas a sufficient compensation for taking the job at such a rate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are 3,010 counties in the United States, 984 have rural service\r\nand steps are being taken to see what can be done with the remainder,\r\nthough any considerable progress in such direction must be slow as a\r\ngreat deal of preliminary work must be done before any real action can\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat fractions count in a great business organization such as the Post\r\nOffice Department, will be seen when it is stated that postmasters\r\nduring the year, 1916, accounted for a total of $131,625.90, arising\r\nfrom gains in fractions of a cent where stamped envelopes and wrappers\r\nwere sold in odd quantities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe annual per capita of expenditure for postage in the United States\r\nhas increased since 1912 from $2.58 to $3.04, and the gross postal\r\nrevenue from $246,744,015 to $312,057,688. In the fiscal year of 1857,\r\nthe first full year in which prepayment of postage by means of stamps\r\nwas compulsory under the Act of March 3, 1855, the per capita use of\r\nstamps was but 19 cents. The increase of population in this period has\r\nbeen 257 per cent. Of postage stamp consumption 4,968 per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sales of postage stamps and other stamped paper for the fiscal year\r\n1916 aggregated $277,728,025.20, an increase of $21,521,481.49, the\r\ngreatest sales and the largest increase ever recorded, exceeding the\r\nentire sales of the fiscal year 1873, which amounted to $20,324,817.50.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Post Office Department was removed to Washington, D. C., first\r\nMonday in December, 1800, the seat of Government being changed to the\r\nDistrict of Columbia at that time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOver 100 years ago the question of patronage was already a disturbing\r\nfeature in the management of public affairs. Gideon Granger, of\r\nConnecticut, Postmaster General in 1814, who had been an active and\r\nefficient official in the administration of President Madison, lost his\r\nplace on account of some disagreement with the President, regarding the\r\nappointment of postmasters. It is not clear whether he resigned or was\r\ndisplaced, but the differences of opinion with President Madison led to\r\nhis retirement from the service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoseph Habersham, of Georgia, Postmaster General in the administration\r\nof General Washington, 1795, was the first one of the long line of\r\nPostmasters General to sit in the Capital of the Nation, he coming to\r\nWashington when the seat of Government was established there in the\r\nyear 1800.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPost route and rural delivery maps made by the Government are on a\r\nscale of 1 inch to the mile. These maps show all public roads, rural\r\nroutes, school houses, churches, streams, etc., and negative prints can\r\nbe purchased at 35 cents each by application to the Third Assistant\r\nPostmaster General.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of claims filed with the Solicitor for the Post Office\r\nDepartment in 1916, for the value of postage stamps lost by burglary of\r\npost offices, was 690, amounting to $144,440.54, as compared with 720\r\nclaims, amounting to $197,011.88, filed in 1915. It will be seen that\r\nwhile the number of claims is approximately the same, the amount is\r\n$52,571.34 less.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in 1857 and prior thereto, to publish the names of\r\nthe postmasters in connection with the post offices as is indicated\r\nby an old Postal Guide published by D. D. T. Leech at that time. This\r\nwas then easily enough done, for the offices then numbered but 13,600\r\nand changes were not as frequent as at present. The First Assistant\r\nPostmaster General had in his Bureau 18 clerks, the Second Assistant,\r\n26, the Third Assistant, 25, and the Chief Clerk of the Department, who\r\nhad charge of the Inspection Service, had 18. There were then but 11\r\ndistributing offices in all of New England including Pennsylvania, 8 in\r\nVirginia, and the Carolinas, 3 in Georgia, 4 in Ohio, 2 in Illinois,\r\nMissouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Iowa, and 1 each in Maryland, Michigan, Indiana, Texas,\r\nand California. Aaron V. Brown, of Tennessee, was the Postmaster\r\nGeneral. The abbreviation for Massachusetts was then “M.S.” as is seen\r\nby an old dating stamp of that period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1868 money orders were issued at the rate of 10 cents for all\r\norders not exceeding $20. By act approved June 8, 1872, the rate was\r\nreduced to 5 cents for all orders not exceeding $10. By this change\r\nthe Government lost, in the two succeeding years on account of this\r\nreduction, 2.84/100 on every order issued on the 5-cent basis, showing\r\nthat such rate at that time was too low.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were 2,405 rural carriers separated from the service during the\r\nyear 1915, of which number 1,228 resigned, 232 died, and 618 were\r\nremoved. In 1916, there were 2,602 changes, 1,844 carriers resigned,\r\n208 died and 550 were removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire expense incident to the operation of the rural mail\r\nservice is in the compensation paid to carriers. On account of their\r\nunusual duties, which include the sale of stamps and stamped paper,\r\nregistration of mail, transaction of money-order business, etc., duties\r\nnot required of city delivery carriers, it is stated that carriers\r\nmaintaining a motor vehicle of the capacity required by the Department,\r\nwho work eight hours a day and carry perhaps as much as 50,000 pieces\r\nof mail a month, should receive not less than $2,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe total number of miles of railroad in the United States in 1830\r\nwas 23, and 634 miles in 1834, on which mail covering 78 miles, was\r\ncarried. In 1844 the mileage had increased to 4,377 and mail carried\r\non 3,714 miles. In 1854 the mileage was 16,720, in 1864, 35,085, in\r\n1874, 70,278, and in 1882, 104,813, with corresponding increase of mail\r\ncarriage. There are now 3,479 railroad mail routes with a length in\r\nmiles of 234,175.13 and an annual travel of 502,937,359.43 miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decision of President Wilson to place all postmasters of the\r\ncountry under the civil service law will take away $16,587,300 of\r\npublic patronage from the customary method of disposal. At the first\r\nof the year there were 567 first-class offices in the country paying\r\nsalaries ranging from $3,000 to $8,000, or a total of $2,014,300.\r\nIncluded in this list were the post offices in New York, Chicago, St.\r\nLouis, Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Indianapolis,\r\nKansas City, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo Columbus, Atlanta, and other\r\nlarge cities. There were 2,213 second-class offices, salaries ranging\r\nfrom $2,000 to $2,900, or a total of $5,235,500. Third-class, 7,437\r\npaying from $1,000 to $1,900 yearly, or a total of $9,337,500.\r\nFourth-class postmasters are already under the civil service law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom 1816 to 1845, a letter carried not over 30 miles paid 6¼ cents,\r\nover 80 and under 150 miles, paid 12½ cents, and if the letter weighed\r\nan ounce, four times these rates were charged. In 1851 the 3-cent rate\r\nwas reached for distances less than 3,000 miles, and in 1853 distance\r\nlimit was abolished and the rate made uniform. This system led to a\r\ndeficiency in 1860 amounting to over $10,000,000. The restriction of\r\nservice during the Civil War, it being then confined to the densely\r\npopulated States of the north, allowed a surplus to appear amounting\r\nin 1863 to $2,800,000. After the war, deficiencies became the rule for\r\nmany years, diminishing, however, from year to year as the country\r\nbecame more thickly settled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy official order it is stated that the Department commends and will\r\ngive record credit marks to rural carriers whose efforts result in\r\ngreater quantities of farm products being transported through the mails.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the growth of the service together with the added\r\nwork of the postal savings system and the parcel post, the Department\r\nservice in Washington has been reduced by 200, with a resultant saving\r\nof over $166,000 per annum because of the adoption of methods of\r\noperation which develop efficiency, and permit the changes so necessary\r\nto progressive improvement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the cost of extending rural free delivery service\r\nthroughout the entire country will be $100,000,000, additional. This\r\nseems like a vast sum for one form of public service, but country-wide\r\nextension is also a vast proposition and its benefits would be so\r\nimmeasurably great if it could be accomplished, that the nation might\r\nconsider the money well spent for such a purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that fully 80 per cent of all civil\r\nservice employees of the Government are in one way and another\r\nconnected with the postal service. This shows how vast and widely\r\nextended this service must be and how intimately connected with the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe objectionable use to which window-delivery service in the cities\r\nof the country may be subjected, has led to an active and vigorous\r\ncampaign by the Department to check the possibility of making this\r\npublic accommodation a channel for unworthy purposes, and this active\r\neffort has, it is believed, been productive of great good in such\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe danger to life and limb by service in postal cars, to which\r\nattention is called elsewhere, has led to increased effort to provide\r\ncars of all-steel construction for better protection in this naturally\r\nhazardous service. One thousand of this pattern have within a recent\r\nperiod been added to those already in use and a liability law enacted\r\nfor the relief of employes. The risks which must be taken in this\r\nservice demand that the best possible protection that can be given\r\nshould be afforded that the dangers of the rail may be lessened to the\r\nleast degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mails of the United States were first carried on steamboats from\r\none post town to another in 1813, the Government paying not over 3\r\ncents for each letter and 1 cent for newspapers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRailroads were declared post routes by act of Congress in July, 1838,\r\nand the mails carried thereon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis administration is certainly doing all it can to save money in\r\nvarious directions. An opportunity was presented in the motors returned\r\nto the Department for repair. These motors have been neglected in many\r\ninstances through indifference or lack of mechanical knowledge on the\r\npart of postal employes. Each returned motor is now given careful\r\nexamination by an expert electrician and from the knowledge thus\r\ngained, additional instructions as to proper handling of this class of\r\nequipment will be sent out. The same is true of old cancelling machines\r\nwhich have lain idle for a number of years but by the adoption of newly\r\ndesigned mechanical attachments have been converted into serviceable\r\nequipment at a nominal cost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe increase in expenditure for rural delivery by periods was as\r\nfollows: 1897, first year, $14,840. Third year, 1900, increased to\r\n$420,433. In 1905, to $20,864,885. In 1910, to $36,914,769, and in 1916\r\nto $51,715,616.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRevision of the rural delivery service to eliminate duplication,\r\nunnecessary retracing and unjustifiable special facilities was\r\nconducted in 329 counties in twenty-nine States during the fiscal year\r\nof 1916, at a reduction in cost of $1,359,162. This saving with that\r\nmade in readjustments in the fiscal year of 1915, made it possible\r\nto grant all applications for new service and extensions where the\r\nrequirements have been met. It is estimated that the whole territory\r\nnow covered by rural service, with such necessary revision, could be\r\noperated at a reduction in cost of $3,500,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commercial shortage in the paper industry is being to some extent\r\nremedied, at least so far as the Post Office Department can aid and\r\nassist, by urging the cooperation of every employe in the conservation\r\nof the waste paper in all of the larger post offices of the country.\r\nPaper-baling machines are now supplied to the postmasters for this\r\npurpose, which not only contributes to economy in use and adds to\r\nthe visible supply, but is a matter of revenue as well, for what was\r\nformerly regarded as waste, and destroyed, is now made a matter of\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe numberless curiosities gathered from unmailable and unreclaimed\r\narticles which found their way into the Dead Letter Office from time\r\nto time, together with the many articles of postal interest to those\r\nwho delight in antiquities--the old mail coaches used in the west, the\r\ndog sledges used in the Alaskan service, the carriers in uniform of all\r\nnations and the many features of interest too tedious to enumerate here\r\nand which formed a veritable collection of postal wonders and delighted\r\nthousands of people when gathered for display purposes on the first\r\nfloor of the Post Office Department are now, in part at least, in the\r\nNational Museum at Washington and are well worthy a visit when people\r\ncome to the Capital City on a sight-seeing tour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe period of greatest activity in extension and general progress of\r\nRural Delivery was from 1900 to 1905, the appropriations running from\r\n$450,000 in 1900 to $21,116,000 in 1905. On February 1, 1902, the rural\r\nletter carriers were placed under the civil service by executive order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSalary increases in the Rural Delivery service have been as follows:\r\nAugust 1, 1897, $300; July 1, 1898, $400; July 1, 1900, $500; March\r\n1, 1902, $600; July 1, 1904, $720; July 1, 1907, $900; July 1, 1911,\r\n$1,000; September 30, 1912, $1,100; July 1, 1914, $1,200.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Old Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\n NOTE.--In some old postal publications dating back to 1843 and 1857, a\r\n number of curious laws and regulations appear which may be of interest\r\n to people who delight in antiquarian research. Where no date or Act of\r\n Congress is mentioned in the paragraphs following, they refer to laws or\r\n regulations prior to 1843 or between that date and 1857. These items are\r\n published simply as indicating the peculiar views and opinions of the\r\n time, and are not to be taken as an official guide for the present day,\r\n for changes may have been made in some cases, amendments in others, some\r\n superseded by later enactment and all more or less affected by later\r\n conditions and needs. No attention can therefore be given them except\r\n as phases of other days, unless indeed existing laws and regulations\r\n make them, or some of them still operative and in force, which may be\r\n determined by consulting the laws and regulations of today.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Senators and Members of Congress, the franking privilege was\r\noriginally limited to 2 ounces in weight, excess to be paid for. Act of\r\nMarch 3, 1825.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sum of 4 cents was allowed for advertising each letter remaining\r\nunclaimed in a post office if published in more than one newspaper.\r\nSection 35, Act July 2, 1836, Act of 1825, Section 26, allowed but 2\r\ncents for each letter, published three times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNewspaper publishers could have printed or written notice sent to\r\nsubscribers stating the amount due on subscription, which shall be\r\nattached to paper and the postmaster shall charge for such notice the\r\nsame postage as for a newspaper. Act of 1825.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo ship or vessel arriving at any port in the United States shall make\r\nentry or break bulk until the mails are delivered to the postmaster by\r\nthe master of such ship or vessel. Penalty was $100. Act of 1825.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 1, Act of March 2, 1847, permitted deputy postmasters whose\r\ncompensation for last preceding year did not exceed $200 to send\r\nletters written by himself, and to receive through the mail written\r\ncommunications addressed to himself in his private business which shall\r\nnot exceed ½ ounce, free of postage. Regulation 293, allowed every\r\ndeputy postmaster to frank and receive free all his letters, public and\r\nprivate, subject to the ½-ounce weight. This privilege did not extend\r\nto his wife or any other member of the family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPaid letters might be forwarded by private opportunity to places where\r\nno post offices were established.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPostmasters were not allowed to give credit for postage, but if it was\r\ndone, letters addressed to such persons on which postage was paid or\r\ntendered by him could not be detained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAct of August 31, 1852, allowed letters enclosed in _stamped envelopes_\r\nto be sent out of the mail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy joint resolution of February 20, 1845, the Postmaster General could\r\nmake contracts with railroads for carrying the mail without advertising\r\nfor bids as was then the custom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe postmaster, or one of his assistants, was required, before office\r\nwas swept or otherwise cleaned of rubbish, to collect and examine all\r\nwaste paper in order to guard against possibility of loss of letters\r\nor mail matter by falling to the floor or mingling with waste paper.\r\nObservance of rule was strictly enjoined, its violation constituted a\r\ngrave offense. They were also admonished in mailing letters or packets\r\nto use all wrapping paper fit to be used again, and the sale of such\r\npaper was strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs late as 1843, postmasters were officially known as “Deputy”\r\npostmasters following the old custom from the beginning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf a newspaper began to arrive at the office in the course of the post\r\noffice quarter, deputy postmasters should demand postage in advance of\r\nthe subscriber up to the end of that quarter. At the end of a quarter,\r\nthey might refund postage on so many of the newspapers as had not\r\narrived during the quarter. Advance payment of postage was invariably\r\ndemanded and unless complied with no papers should be delivered even\r\nthough the postage was tendered on them singly. (Act, 1825.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarriers were required to receive and convey a letter (and the money\r\nfor its postage when tendered) if delivered more than a mile from a\r\npost office and to hand it with the money, if paid, into the first post\r\noffice at which carrier arrived. A penalty of $50 attached on failure\r\nto do so. (Act of 1825).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPostmasters were forbidden to show any preference between one person\r\nand another in the arrival or delivery of mail by the unlawful\r\ndetention of any letters, packages, pamphlet or newspaper. A fine not\r\nexceeding $500 was the penalty and the person was forever prohibited\r\nfrom serving as postmaster. (Act of July 2, 1836.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA ferryman who by wilful neglect or refusal to transport mail across\r\na ferry thereby delaying the same, was to be fined $10 for every ten\r\nminutes of such delay. (Act of March 3, 1825.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLetter carriers employed at such post offices as the Postmaster\r\nGeneral may direct, were allowed to collect 2 cents for each letter\r\nthey delivered. For letters lodged at the post office by direction\r\nof the individual, the postmaster was to receive 1 cent; newspapers\r\nand pamphlets ½ cent; letters received by carrier for deposit in a\r\npost office, 2 cents, to be paid to the postmaster for a fund for\r\ncompensation of carriers. This was known as the “penny post” and was in\r\nvogue until the day of free delivery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 38, Act of March 3, 1825, provided that: Any person confined\r\nin jail on any judgment in a civil case obtained in behalf of the Post\r\nOffice Department, who makes affidavit that he has a claim against the\r\nGeneral Post Office, not allowed by the Postmaster General, and shall\r\nspecify such claim in the affidavit, that he could not be prepared for\r\ntrial by lack of evidence, the court being satisfied in those respects,\r\nmay be granted a continuance by the court until the next term, and\r\nthe Postmaster General authorized to have such party discharged from\r\nimprisonment if he has no property, of any description, but such\r\nrelease shall not bar a subsequent execution against the property of\r\nthe defendant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA postmaster was not allowed to receive free of postage, or frank any\r\nletter or packet, composed of, or containing anything other than paper\r\nor money. (Sec. 36; Act of July 2, 1836.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the Postal Laws and Regulations of 1843, only a free\r\nwhite person could carry the mail and any contractor who employed or\r\npermitted any other than a free white person to convey mail was subject\r\nto a penalty of $20.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt post offices where the mail arrived between 9.00 o’clock at night\r\nand 5.00 in the morning, the postmaster was allowed a commission not\r\nto exceed 50 per cent on the first $100 collected in any one quarter\r\n(Act of March 3, 1825), but the commission was afterwards increased\r\nto 70 per cent. (Act of June 22, 1854.) No allowance on this account\r\nwas, however, to be made unless accompanied by a certificate signed by\r\npostmaster upon a prescribed form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPost riders and other carriers of mail collecting way letters on which\r\npostage had been paid, were allowed 1 cent each for such service by the\r\npostmaster when such letters were delivered at the post office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Express mail service” could be established by the Postmaster General\r\nif deemed expedient, for the purpose of conveying slips from newspapers\r\nin lieu of exchanges, or letters, except such as contained money, not\r\nexceeding ½ ounce in weight, and public dispatches, marked as above, at\r\ntriple rates of postage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEmployment of extra clerks was permitted and authorized when actually\r\nneeded to answer some information called for by Congress. Copyists,\r\netc., were paid at the rate of $3 a day; other service $4 when actually\r\nand necessarily employed. (Act of August 26, 1842.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 442, Chapter 60, says: “Every deputy postmaster will consider\r\nhimself the Sentinel of the Department in regard to its affairs in\r\nhis immediate vicinity; and he will carefully observe and promptly\r\nreport to it everything tending to affect its interests or injure its\r\nreputation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 445 says: “If a mail carrier having the mail in charge becomes\r\nintoxicated, the Deputy Postmaster will instantly dismiss him, employ\r\nanother at the expense of the contractor and report the facts to the\r\nDepartment.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 382, Chapter 53. “Deputy postmasters are in the habit of\r\nsettling their printer’s bills only once in two or three years and then\r\nforwarding the advertising account for several quarters at once. This\r\nmust not be done. All such accounts must be forwarded with the returns\r\nto which they belong.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSection 379. “No allowance for furniture will be made to any post\r\noffice when the net proceeds do not amount to $20 per year.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAct of 1825, Section 39, and Act of 1863, Section 41, says the carriers\r\nof the “United States City Dispatch Post” in New York, and other city\r\ndispatch posts, wherever established, are authorized to charge and\r\ncollect 3 cents on each letter deposited in any part of the city, and\r\ndelivered at another.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAct of 1825, Section 38, states a deputy postmaster will not open, nor\r\nsuffer to be opened, any packet of newspapers, not addressed to his\r\noffice, under a penalty of $50. A penalty of $20 was to be imposed on\r\nany person not authorized to open mails, who shall open any packet of\r\nnewspapers not directed to himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRegulations 324 and 325 says that the franking privilege travels with\r\nthe person possessing it and can be exercised in but one place at\r\nthe same time, and prohibited deputy postmasters or other privileged\r\npersons from leaving their frank behind them upon envelopes to cover\r\npublic or private correspondence in their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueer Collection in Holiday Mail\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the Cincinnati, Ohio, post office, gave an account\r\nof the queer combinations and collections of articles found loose\r\nin the mails at the Christmas season owing to the carelessness of\r\nsenders. These articles vary from value to worthlessness, utility to\r\nuselessness. Money, jewelry, articles of dress, dainty ribbons to\r\nchoice silk patters, tableware, and even to “corn shellers.” Many of\r\nthe articles named were doubtless in combinations and sent to one\r\naddress, but being carelessly wrapped or addressed, they could not be\r\nassembled for identification or identified singly for delivery in the\r\ngreat majority of cases. The list is given for the benefit of readers\r\nwho delight in curious things. These articles were held for a week for\r\npossible identification and then sent to the Dead Letter Office. No\r\nattempt has been made at classification as more interest is excited by\r\ntaking them as they come. Some of the combination must have been very\r\namusing. List is as follows:\r\n\r\nA cabinet photograph, pair rubber sleeves, 2 silver quarter-dollars,\r\nsewing machine shuttle, piece of white swiss goods, 2 dimes, a brass\r\nkey, package common tea spoons, 5 cents and 8 childs’ cards from\r\nBeamsville, Ont., for Mrs. J. Carl, Tallahassee, Ala., and sent to the\r\npostmaster of that place for delivery. Two unstamped letters, one to\r\nMrs. Rebecca Washington, the other to Wm. Cummings; 65 cents, plated\r\nbutter knife, gold plated lead pencil, silver quarter, 2 combination\r\ntools, 2 pen knives, lot photographs, pension affidavit of Jasper\r\nAcres, pair knit stockings, 6 books, false mustaches, pearl pen holder,\r\nbox of pills, patent corn sheller, 2 electrotype plates of “Sellers\r\nCough Syrup,” yellow and purple knit hoods. Christmas cards, studs,\r\n2 small drills, peacock feather, fountain pen, ladies brooch, butter\r\nknife, felt soles, letter in match box addressed to postmaster Berlin,\r\nsugarspoon, celluloid, ring, sleeve buttons, 25 cents, hair switch,\r\nopen letter to J. Lyon, Red, Ky., Ind., which was delivered to him.\r\n\r\nTwo pen knives, dime, box violin strings, ladies fashion bazaar,\r\nbottle “Fruit Laxative,” plain gold ring, ear rings, breast pin, and\r\nthimble (snide), paper needles, book “Bad Boy’s diary,” pencil, large\r\npen knife, 70 cents, unstamped letter to Adelaide Long, iron hook, toy\r\nknitting machine, 2 tops of sleeve buttons, hair chain, lot crayons,\r\nchalk, letter to P. O. Wickley, Augusta, Me., unstamped, containing 70\r\ncents in stamps, child’s book “The Proud Little Lady,” magic lantern,\r\nwatch chain, masonic charm, ½-dozen teaspoons, paper needles, childs\r\nmits, comforter and doll, 2 harmonicons, Bible, child’s gingham dress,\r\n2 sticks of candy. A wallet containing a gold double eagle, $20\r\nbill, 9 $5 bills, 3 $10 bills, found by F. A. Montague, in a pouch\r\nfrom Lewisburg, Tenn., and returned to postmaster of that town to be\r\ndelivered upon receipt to the sender.\r\n\r\nGold plated pencil, unaddressed envelope, containing pair of lisle\r\nthread gloves, black and white stamped ribbon, uninclosed letter\r\ncontaining $1 marked from “Joe to Gus,” two-cent piece, gold and jet\r\npencil holder, butter knife, tidy, white apron, pair baby socks, blank\r\ncheck book, dominoes, black cord and tassel, red worsted shawl, tidy.\r\nWooden box, lot of candy, assortment of rubber sheep. Letter from R.\r\nMacFeeley, Washington, D. C., to Capt. A. M. Corliss, without envelope,\r\none cent, German picture cards, meerschaum cigar holder, woman’s head\r\ndesign. Three plain rings, four watch charms, compass, horseshoe cigar\r\ncutter, two lanterns, pearl handled table knife, billiard ball, silver\r\nquarter sewed in some knit work, whisk broom, a false tooth, two black\r\nties, three New Year cards, hair switch, curry comb, vanity case,\r\nstuffed Aunt Dinah, game “Old Maid,” box Mason’s blacking with brush,\r\nfiddle strings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding the Cats\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not generally known that cats are kept and fed at the\r\npublic expense in some of the larger post offices of the country. Some\r\nyears ago (and it may still be the custom) an appropriation of from\r\n$80 to $100 was annually made for this purpose for the benefit of the\r\nNew York post office, and $30 to $40, spent for like service at the\r\nPhiladelphia office. In an article in the _Philadelphia Record_ it was\r\nstated that a man in that city had a contract for keeping these feline\r\nemployes of the office in provisions, and it was also mentioned that\r\nthere are about 1,000 of these useful domestic animals in the employ of\r\nthe Post Office Department and they are paid for their services by food\r\nand shelter. It is estimated that about $1,000 per annum is expended in\r\nthis way at the principal post offices and large public buildings of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nFerrets are also often employed for this purpose in the great public\r\nbuildings in Washington when the rodents get too numerous and damage\r\nto papers and files likely to occur. The common practice of eating\r\nlunches in these government buildings tends to the spread of this\r\nannoying condition and the cats in the public service are held to be a\r\nuseful and necessary convenience in hunting down and interfering with\r\nthe nibbling propensities of this pest to domestic as well as public\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Couple of Distinguished Canines\r\n\r\nMention is made in another article of the employment of cats in post\r\noffices as “mousers,” and they doubtless contribute their share towards\r\npublic benefit. The dog, man’s most faithful friend, so eulogized in\r\nsong and story, has also, it seems, his part in public interest and\r\nconcern. For many years the postal clerks of the country paid great\r\nattention to “Owney” an adventurous terrier dog who attached himself to\r\nthe Railway Service and whose exploits as a traveler and companion on\r\nmany postal trips and runs made him a familiar and welcome acquaintance\r\nwherever he established his temporary domicile. His faithfulness,\r\nfriendship and fellowship, in his way of showing it, was the topic of\r\ndiscourse when he made his occasional visits and his praises were told\r\nin many a newspaper story and he wore the numerous decorations and\r\nmedals with which he was bedecked, the gift of admiring friends, with\r\nall the dignity and grace becoming a dog so honored and esteemed.\r\n\r\n“Owney” had an humble imitator and counterpart in canine sagacity and\r\nwisdom in a dog at Mount Carmel, Pa., whose watchful guardianship of\r\nthe office mail and general fidelity won him such deserved recognition\r\nat home as a remarkable example of what a dog can be taught to do, that\r\nhis fame spread abroad, was brought to public attention at Washington\r\nand the post office people awarded him special recognition in the shape\r\nof a handsome collar, raised by subscription. He got his name in the\r\nnewspapers, but whether all this honor and glory turned his head and\r\nhis attention elsewhere, or some evil-minded person, jealous of the\r\ncostly collar he wore, appropriated it and the dog also, is not known,\r\nbut after being thus honored and decorated and set apart from the rest\r\nof the canine fraternity, this famous dog suddenly disappeared and was\r\nnever heard of again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldier’s Sister a Mail Carrier\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson has issued an executive order allowing the Postmaster\r\nGeneral to appoint as temporary rural mail carrier, during the absence\r\nof the regular carrier on military duty, the person on whom the support\r\nof the dependents of the regular carrier devolves, without regard to\r\ncivil service requirements, if the substitute is found competent. The\r\nfirst appointment under the order is that of Miss Edith Strand, of\r\nPrinceton, Ill., whose brother was called into the military service,\r\nleaving her to care for the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet giving a brief history of the postal service, compiled by\r\nMr. Stanley I. Slack during the administration of Postmaster General\r\nCharles Emory Smith from which a few general facts are taken relating\r\nto our early postal history, appears a statement that use had been\r\nmade of the following works--Journal kept by Hugh Finlay, 1773-74,\r\nBrooklyn, 1867. Joyce “History of the British Post Office; The Early\r\nHistory of the Colonial Post Office by Mary E. Wooley; Leech and\r\nNicholson’s History of the Post Office Department, Washington, 1879,\r\nand the contributions of the Postal History of the United States by C.\r\nW. Ernst of Boston in Vols. XX, 1895, and XXI, 1896; Journal of the\r\nPostal Union.” As none of these authorities have been consulted in\r\nthe publication of this work, or access had to any of them for such\r\npurpose, this explanation is made so that if anything from the above\r\nmentioned publications appears herein, drawn from Mr. Slack’s pamphlet,\r\nthe necessary acknowledgment might hereby be made and due credit given.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      INDEX TO ITEMS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n  Annual readjustment salaries, 93\r\n  Claims for stamps lost by burglary, 95\r\n  Credit marks for rural carriers, 97\r\n  Cost, country-wide extension rural delivery, 97\r\n  Difference in dispatch parcel post matter, 93\r\n  Department force at Washington reduced, 97\r\n  Eligibles, fourth-class postmasters, 93\r\n  Expenditure rural delivery by periods, 98\r\n  First Postmaster General to sit at Capital, 94\r\n  Gain to Department in fractions of a cent, 94\r\n  Increase rural carriers’ pay, 96\r\n  Longest mail route, 93\r\n  Longest star route, 93\r\n  Loss to Government by low money order rate, 95\r\n  Mails first carried on steamboats, 98\r\n  Number of counties having rural service, 93\r\n  Names of postmasters mentioned in 1857, 95\r\n  Number of postmasters affected by order of President, 96\r\n  Per capita expenditure for postage, 94\r\n  Patronage 100 years ago, 94\r\n  Period of greatest activity, rural service, 99\r\n  Post routes, rural delivery maps, 95\r\n  Postal employes in public service, 97\r\n  Paper baling machines, 99\r\n  Postal curiosities in National Museum, 99\r\n  Postmasters by classes, 93\r\n  Postage stamp sale, 1916, 94\r\n  Railroads declared post routes, 98\r\n  Rural carriers separated from service, 1915-1916, 96\r\n  Rates of postage, 1816 to 1853, 96\r\n  Revision of rural service, 98\r\n  Shortest postal route, 93\r\n  Salary increases, rural carriers, 99\r\n  Saving money by motor repairs, 98\r\n  Sale postage stamps, 1916, 94\r\n  Total railroad mileage, 1830, 96\r\n  Window delivery service, 97\r\n  When the Department was moved to Washington, 94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\n--Obvious errors were corrected.",
