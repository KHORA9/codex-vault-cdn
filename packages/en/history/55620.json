the years 1914, 1915,\r\n1916, 1917, and 1918, or during as many of these years as they\r\nexisted—for a number of them were created after the war had started. The\r\nrecord of each has been known as a “divisional history.”\r\n\r\nThe history of an enemy division is a summary of all the information\r\nobtained from all sources. It includes the latest composition—that is,\r\nthe regiments and other units that make up the division; a record of its\r\npast engagements; its recruitment and racial features; commanders;\r\npresent strength; and morale. On a basis of these factors the division’s\r\nfighting quality is rated on a standard of classes adopted by General\r\nHeadquarters and noted in the history. The data is collected and filed\r\ndaily at various troop headquarters and eventually in the Enemy Order of\r\nBattle subsection of the General Staff, Intelligence Section at the\r\nGeneral Headquarters. The information comes chiefly from the front-line\r\ntroops, resulting from their observation, reconnaissance, and the\r\ninterrogation of the prisoners they take. This evidence is often\r\nfragmentary and inconclusive, being gathered as more or less\r\ndisassociated items, here and there along the whole front. But when it\r\nis consolidated and collated it becomes of great value and warrants\r\ndeductions which may be depended upon.\r\n\r\nPrisoners’ statements and captured documents are the source of almost\r\nall the information contained in a divisional history. The outline of\r\nthe past engagements of a division is known from the Battle-Order\r\nrecords. Prisoners add to this specific account of successes, citations,\r\nfailures, internal disturbance, etc. The divisional composition is\r\nestablished by prisoners, and in the case of the smaller divisional\r\nunits from addresses on captured letters. The effective strength is\r\ndeduced from prisoners’ stories of recent losses incurred and drafts of\r\nnew men arriving. In estimating the quality of a division the\r\nIntelligence Section considers principally the conditions under which\r\nthe enemy command has used it in previous military operations.\r\n\r\nAll this information is kept posted up to date so that a history of\r\npresent value can be written without delay and dispatched to our front-\r\nline troops opposite whom a new or additional enemy unit has appeared or\r\nis about to appear.\r\n\r\nThe use to our troops of these histories is obvious. Much of the\r\ninformation contained is of direct value to our commanders. The\r\nstrength, morale, and fighting qualities of the opposing divisions are,\r\nof course, an important factor in our plans and operations. Other items,\r\nsuch as the names of the enemy commanders, assist the examining officer\r\nin checking the veracity and accuracy of prisoners’ statements. It has\r\nbeen often observed that the more the intelligence officer knows or\r\nappears to know of the prisoner’s organization the better results he\r\nobtains from his questions. The uses to which information of the enemy\r\nmay be put have proved so various and unexpected that the principle is\r\nestablished that no fact about the enemy is too unimportant to be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this set of Histories of German Divisions the histories\r\npublished by French General Headquarters have been used for the years\r\nprior to 1918. For the last year of the war the histories were written\r\nby the Second Section of the General Staff, General Headquarters, A. E.\r\nF., from the American records. These included all information from\r\nAmerican sources and also that which was received from Allied armies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Alpine Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Bav.

At the end of May, 1915, it was sent by way of Innsbruck to the\r\nTrentino, where it remained until October 16 (vicinity of Campitello).\r\nIt took part in several smaller actions (particularly on Sept. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. On October 17 it left Bozen and went to France by way of Innsbruck,\r\nNeu-Ulm, Stuttgart, Deux-Ponts, and detrained at Laonnois on the\r\nMezieres-Rethel line on October 19.\r\n\r\n3. It remained in this area until October 25. At that time it was\r\ntransferred to Serbia by way of Mezieres, Germershein, Augsburg, Munich,\r\nVienna, Budapest, Temesvar. It detrained at Weisskirchen on October 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n4. The Alpine Corps advanced in Serbia by way of Kragujevac and Kraljevo\r\nas far as Novipasar (near the Montenegrin frontier); from that place to\r\nMitrovica. Elements of the Alpine Corps remained south of Uskub until\r\nthe end of March, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. On March 21, 1916, the Alpine Corps was taken to Hungary by way of\r\nBelgrade, and then to France. Itinerary: Budapest, Breslau, Dresden,\r\nLeipzig, Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Liege, Charleville.\r\n\r\n2. It went into line on the front east of Rheims (the Leib Regiment at\r\nCernay) on April 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the beginning of May, it went to rest in the vicinity of\r\nCharleville. About May 30 it went to the Spincourt area by way of Sedan.\r\nAt the beginning of June it went into action at Verdun north of the Vaux\r\nFort, northeast of Fleury, and took part in the attacks launched in this\r\nsector during the month of June (attack of June 23 upon Thiaumont).\r\n\r\n4. After reorganization, at the end of June or the beginning of July,\r\nthe Alpine Corps came back into line near Fleury on July 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n5. After having lost 71 per cent of its Infantry in the various attacks\r\nat Verdun, the Alpine Corps was withdrawn on August 12 and took over the\r\nsector Fontaine-aux-Charmes-Vauquois, in the Argonne. The 3d Jaeger\r\nRegiment was taken from it and entered into the composition of the 200th\r\nDivision (Carpathian Corps).\r\n\r\n6. In the first half of September the Alpine Corps left the Argonne and\r\nentrained for Roumania.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of September it went into action in the vicinity of\r\nHermannstadt, then in the vicinity of Brasso. On December 10 it reached\r\nPloesci; it was at Rimnicu-Sarat on the 24th. Upon the stabilization of\r\nthe Roumanian front it occupied the front of Panciu-Focsani. During the\r\nactive period in Roumania the Leib Regiment lost heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved northwest of Focsani on April 6, 1917, the Alpine Corps was\r\nsent to Hungary, in the vicinity of Karlsburg. After a rest of three\r\nweeks it was transferred to the western front. Itinerary: Karlsburg (May\r\n10), Szegdin, Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg, Rosenheim, Munich, Strassburg,\r\nColmar, Neu-Breisach.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER ALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. On June 15 it went into line on the Alsatian front (Rhone-Rhine\r\nCanal, Aspach).\r\n\r\n3. On July 20 it was withdrawn from the front and sent to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of August it was again sent to Roumania. It took\r\nover its old sector near Focsani and received the Russo-Roumanian\r\nattacks launched between Briala and Panciu.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n5. In September it was sent to the Italian front.\r\n\r\n\r\nIZONZO.\r\n\r\n6. On October 24 it attacked on both sides of the Tolmino and took\r\npossession of Mont Cucco on the 25th. It rested in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTE TOMBA.\r\n\r\n7. On November 25 it was engaged at Monte Tomba, and on December 12 on\r\nthe slopes of Monfenera, with the exception of the 1st Jaeger Regiment,\r\nwhich was in reserve.\r\n\r\n8. Relieved between December 15 and December 20, it remained behind the\r\nlines until the middle of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe Leib Regiment and the 1st Regiment of Jaegers are Bavarian,\r\nrecruited principally from upper Bavaria. The 2d Regiment of Jaegers is\r\npurely Prussian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe discipline and firmness of the commanding officers make the Alpine\r\nCorps an elite body, of a genuine combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In January the Alpine Corps entrained for Alsace (itinerary Salzburg,\r\nMunich, Ulm, Friburg, Saverne); then went to rest in the region of\r\nSarreburg.\r\n\r\n2. It remained here undergoing training until the 10th of April.\r\n\r\n3. It was sent to Flanders, via Metz, Sedan, Namur, and detrained near\r\nLille on the 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n4. The division was engaged northeast of Bailleul from the 14th to the\r\n18th. It then rested east of Lille until the 23d. It reentered the line\r\non the Kemmel-Locre front, where it remained until about the 10th of\r\nMay, when it was withdrawn, after having suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. It moved then to the Ghent region, where it rested until the end of\r\nJuly. It then rested near Tourcoing until the 8th of August. It\r\nentrained at Tourcoing and Tournai on the 8th and went to St. Quentin\r\nvia Ham.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n6. The division entered line in the Hallu-Fransart-Hattencourt sector\r\nnorth of Roye on the 11th. On the 27th it fell back along the Somme\r\nCanal near Bethencourt. It was withdrawn from line the beginning of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n7. It came back to line almost immediately north of Peronne in the\r\nMoislain sector; on the 7th it was thrown back upon Longavesnes-Epehy-\r\nVillers-Guislain, where it was withdrawn on the 23d, after losing\r\nheavily (861 prisoners).\r\n\r\n8. Elements of the Alpine Corps were identified at Walincourt in rear of\r\nthe front on October 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALKANS.\r\n\r\n9. Sent to the eastern front, the Alpine Corps reinforced the troops in\r\nthe Balkans near Nish in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine Corps was considered one of the best German units. It showed\r\nits worth by retaking the village of Hallu on the 11th of August, and\r\nwhile counterattacking at Moislains on the 2d of September.\r\nNevertheless, the morale was lowered. The Alpine Corps comprised about\r\n3,500 Infantry combatants early in August. It lost about 700 prisoners\r\nin August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Bavarian Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                        │                     1918\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n                        │       Brigade.        │       Regiment.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Cavalry.               │1 Bav.

But\r\nafterwards this designation indicated a composite division (Benzino\r\nDivision) formed from the 3d Bavarian Reserve Brigade and the 59th\r\nLandwehr Brigade (28th Ersatz, Baden) and the 120th Landwehr Regiment\r\n(Wurttemberg).\r\n\r\n\r\nVOSGES.\r\n\r\n1. The Benzino Division was first engaged in the Vosges (St. Marie\r\nRidge, St. Die, Laveline) until September.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n2. After a rest in the Valley of the Bruche, it entrained at the end of\r\nSeptember for Mars-la-Tour and reinforced the 3d Bavarian Corps in the\r\nSt. Mihiel area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. The Benzino Division occupied the area east of St. Mihiel (Spada to\r\nApremont) during the entire year 1915. In November it took the name of\r\nBavarian Ersatz Division.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested in Lorraine from December, 1915, to the end of\r\nFebruary, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February, 1916, the 120th Landwehr Regiment was\r\nreplaced by a Prussian Regiment, the 81st Landwehr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. On February 28, 1916, the Bavarian Ersatz Division took over the\r\nsector of Fresnes-en-Woëvre-Ronvaux. It remained there until the end of\r\nOctober, 1916. On October 17, the 4th Bavarian Reserve Regiment left the\r\ndivision temporarily to go to Galicia, to the 199th Division, and came\r\nback in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. From October 25 to November 15 the Bavarian Ersatz Division took part\r\nin the battle of the Somme east of Gueudecourt, with the exception of\r\nthe 81st Landwehr, which was definitely detached from the division.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to the Aisne, it went into line in the vicinity of\r\nCraonne at the end of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. On the Aisne front, east of Craonne, the Bavarian Ersatz Division\r\nreceived the French offensive of April, and its conduct gained the order\r\n“Pour le Mérite” for its general.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved at the end of April, it occupied a sector in the Apremont\r\nWood from the middle of May to the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n3. On September 1 it was in Belgium, where it was engaged on both sides\r\nof the Ypres-Menin road until September 25. The 3d Battalion of the 4th\r\nBavarian Reserve Regiment was almost destroyed on September 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October the division was transferred to the\r\neastern front and sent into line southeast of Tarnopol in December.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of autumn 1917, the 28th Ersatz Regiment (Baden) was\r\nwithdrawn from the division and replaced by the 18th Bavarian Reserve.\r\nThe division was then entirely Bavarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Ersatz Division is recruited from the 1st and 2d Bavarian\r\nCorps districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Ersatz Division is a very mediocre division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the quiet Verdun sector until July 12, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 231st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE.\r\n\r\n2. It was moved to the Vesle front and on July 25 relieved the 40th\r\nDivision near Oulchy-le-Chateau. It remained in this sector until August\r\n12, when it was withdrawn and sent to rest in the vicinity of Maubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. On September 1 it proceeded to Mauchault and during the first days of\r\nSeptember relieved the 88th Division in line near Perthes. It was in the\r\nfighting between September 23 and October 3 in Champagne, losing about\r\n2,000 men in that engagement.\r\n\r\n4. The division was so reduced in strength that it was dissolved shortly\r\nafter its retirement from line in October. The 18th Bavarian Reserve\r\nRegiment was dissolved and the men drafted to the 15th Bavarian\r\nDivision. The 15th Bavarian Reserve Regiment was also dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was used only in defensive\r\nsectors during 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Jaeger Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1917        │       1918        │       1919\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │11 Jag.  │         │         │5 Ers.   │11 Jag.\r\n              │         │12 Jag.  │         │         │         │12 Jag.\r\n              │         │13 Jag.  │         │         │         │13 Jag.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │1 Sqn. 10 Drag.\r\n              │                   │                   │  Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │Staff, 2 Ulan Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │Staff, 8 Bav.

Relieved at the beginning of January, 1918, it was sent\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe Jaeger Division is a very good Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division again entrained March 20 and was transported to the area\r\nnortheast of St. Quentin by way of Strasbourg, Treves, Cologne, Liege,\r\nNamur, Charleroi, Maubeuge, Bohain. From there it marched to the region\r\nsouth of Chaulnes and rested three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It was in line in the Villers-Bretonneux sector from April 27 to May\r\n19–20. After its withdrawal from line it rested southwest of Guise\r\n(Bernot, Hauteville) from 25th to 30th. The division marched toward the\r\nfront by Ham (May 30) and arrived in the neighborhood of Lassigny on\r\nJune 7–8.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was engaged near Lassigny (Le Plessier) on June 9 and\r\nadvanced as far as Elincourt. It was relieved about mid-June.\r\n\r\n4. It rested between St. Quentin and Guise for a time, and was then\r\nrailed to Alsace (near Mulhausen), where it rested during four weeks. It\r\nentrained at Mulhausen about July 24–27 and was moved to Liesse\r\n(northeast of Laon) on July 30. From there it marched toward the front\r\nnorth of Soissons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was engaged at Soissons and Pommiers, then at Bieuxy-\r\nJuvigny, from August 2 to 28. It rested for two weeks and returned to\r\nline at Gouzaucourt on September 12. Between September 27–30 it was\r\nforced to fall back on La Vacquerie and Gonnelieu. It was relieved at\r\nthe end of the month after suffering very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n6. On October 6–7 the division was reengaged south of Cambrai\r\n(Walincourt). It fell back on Briastre by Caudry and on the 15th retired\r\nfrom the front. It rested from October 15 to 22. On the 12th the\r\ndivision is known to have received a reinforcement of 600 men.\r\n\r\n7. It was engaged southwest of Le Quesnoy from October 22 to November 1,\r\nlosing numerous prisoners on the 24th. After a short rest it was again\r\nin line at Etreux and south of Le Quesnoy on November 4–5. It retreated\r\nby Pont-sur-Sambre on November 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as an attack\r\ndivision in the Matz offensive, but in general the division was used to\r\nreplace assault divisions and hold an important sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1st Guard Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Gd.    │1 Ft.

Detrained on the 11th and 12th of August in “Prussian Wallonia,” at\r\nWeismes and neighboring stations. Entered Belgium August 13, via\r\nStavelot; crossed the Meuse at Huy on the 18th. The 23d it fought at\r\nFosse and St. Gerard, after having crossed the Sambre at Jemmapes.\r\nFought at Fournaux on the 24th. Was engaged, August 29, between Guise\r\nand Vervins (le Sourd, Leme).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n2. It fought next on the Marne (St. Gond marsh).\r\n\r\n3. It was in Artois near Hebuterne the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. In November the 1st Bde. was in Flanders (Gheluvelt); the 2d Bde.\r\nremained at Hebuterne. From the beginning of the campaign until January\r\n19, 1915, the 3d Ft. Gd. Regt. suffered casualties of 49 officers and\r\n2,707 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The beginning of January the 1st Bde. went from Gheluvelt to\r\nChampagne.\r\n\r\n2. The beginning of February the 2d Bde. rejoined the 1st.\r\n\r\n3. In March the division went to Alsace, where the whole Guard Corps was\r\nbrought together again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. In April the division went to Russia (Galicia), detraining at Bochnia\r\nthe 22d.\r\n\r\n5. It fought at Tarnow and Krasnoslaw, skirted Brest-Litowsk, and pushed\r\non to Krobin. The losses of the 3d Ft. Gd. Regt. in Russia (May 15-Aug.\r\n31) were 17 officers and 2,116 men. The 1st Ft. Gd. Regt. lost 53\r\nofficers and 3,005 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n6. Brought back by stages to Warsaw; entrained about the 15th of\r\nSeptember for the western front. Itinerary: Thorn, Posen, Frankfort-on-\r\nthe-Oder, Berlin, Cassel, Giessen, Coblentz, Treves, Luxemburg, Namur,\r\nCharleroi.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n7. Reassembled at Charleroi, the division was alerted September 25, and\r\nengaged on the Artois front (Folie). Losses of the 1st Ft. Gd. Regt. in\r\nthe fighting of the end of September amounted to 1,522.\r\n\r\n8. Relieved October 20, it took over the Lassigny-Beuvraignes sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the calm Lassigny sector until July 20,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n2. After some days rest in the neighborhood of Nesles, the division went\r\nby stages to the Peronne region, where it was put in reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. August 15 it relieved, in the course of the battle of the Somme, what\r\nwas left of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n4. The division lost heavily (5,000 men, only 300 of whom were\r\nprisoners) during the attacks of the 19th and 20th of August and at the\r\ntime of the costly defense of Clery (Sept. 3), and therefore it was\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n5. Reassembled in the Catelet region, and having received\r\nreenforcements, it went back into line south of the Somme, in the\r\nBiaches-Barleux sector. Its losses there were considerably less.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division was withdrawn from the Biaches-Barleux sector the end of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n2. It reformed, went through a course of training, and then proceeded to\r\nthe Guiscard region. During February, 1917, it received 500\r\nreenforcements (1917 class, recuperated men). In March its depot was\r\nempty (all the men having been sent to the division).\r\n\r\n3. The beginning of April the division reassembled in the Sissonne\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n4. As early as April 12, before the French attack on the Aisne front, it\r\nwas alerted. April 17 it was engaged in the Ailles-Hurtebise sector.\r\nThere it went through the attack of May 5. (Losses, 2,500 to 3,000 men\r\nfor the whole division, only 141 prisoners.)\r\n\r\n5. Relieved a few days later, it took over a sector in the Argonne\r\n(Grand Courte-Chaussee), where it remained the month of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n6. On July 4 it left for Russia. (Itinerary: Namur, Liège, Aix-la-\r\nChapelle, Duesseldorf, Minden, Hanover, Berlin, Frankfort-on-the-Oder,\r\nPosen, Lodz, Brest-Litowsk, Kovel, Lemberg, Ozidow; it detrained July\r\n9.)\r\n\r\n7. The division participated in the counterattack against the Russians,\r\nand later in the attack of Riga.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n8. It was brought back to France in the middle of October. (Entrained at\r\nRiga Oct. 16. Itinerary: Koenigsberg, Posen, Halle, Cassel, Coblentz,\r\nSedan, Novion-Porcien; detrained near Rethel, Oct. 21.)\r\n\r\n9. The division took over the Marquise sector in Champagne the end of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Guard Division may be considered one of the very best German\r\ndivisions. Excellent conduct under fire.\r\n\r\nIt displayed on the Aisne as well as on the Somme energy and\r\ndetermination while on the defensive.\r\n\r\nAmong its heavy losses there was an exceedingly small number of\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAgain on the Aisne (April-May, 1917), it displayed remarkable military\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIt received important reenforcements of the younger classes (15–16–17),\r\n30 per cent from the class of 1917.\r\n\r\nIts normal value was reduced temporarily on account of the arrival of\r\nelements which had never been under fire (June, 1917).\r\n\r\nPrisoners taken in the Argonne (June, 1917) seemed less keen for\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line until the 21st of January.\r\n\r\n2. It was withdrawn at that date and put through a course of training in\r\nopen warfare until March 1, when it entered line east of Reims\r\n(relieving 203d Division), remaining in until the 15th in order to\r\nbecome familiar with the terrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. It remained in close support north of Montdidier, and finally entered\r\nline March 28 near Hangest-en-Santerre, fighting until April 5, and\r\ngiving a good account of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIMAY.\r\n\r\n4. The division went through another course of training in the Chimay\r\narea until May 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division entered line in the Grivesnes sector. It fought very\r\nwell in this the Aisne offensive, immediately after which its commander,\r\nPrince Eitel Friedrich, was promoted from colonel to major general, but\r\nsuffered exceedingly heavy losses. It was withdrawn June 7, going to\r\nrest in the Charleroi region, where it remained until July 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n6. It entered line on that date east of Dormans, and despite stubborn\r\nresistance by the French succeeded in making some headway. July 22–23 it\r\nmoved slightly to the west, relieving the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division\r\nnear Passy-sur-Marne. It moved back, giving ground to the Allied counter\r\noffensive, and was finally withdrawn from line north of Fere-en-\r\nTardenois August 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRECY-AU-MONT.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested then until August 25 in the vicinity of Rethel,\r\nand then came into line near Crecy-au-Mont and fought until September 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n8. September 20 the division moved eastward and relieved the 53d Reserve\r\nDivision in the Varennes sector, where it was when (Sept. 26) it was\r\nswamped by the opening of the American Meuse-Argonne offensive. It did\r\nnot resist as strongly as it might have, and so the 5th Guard Division\r\nmoved to its support. Withdrawn on the 29th, it, in turn, returned\r\nOctober 3 to support the 5th Guard. It was finally withdrawn on the 8th\r\nafter it had most of its battalions reduced to one company. It left\r\n1,788 prisoners in our hands; its total losses probably being about\r\n4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\nThe division was identified in line farther to the west October 14 at\r\nOlizy, and near Chestres on the 21st. It remained in line in this region\r\ncontesting the French advance until the Armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war the division was rated as one of the very best German\r\nshock divisions. During the last year it fought a great deal and, until\r\nthe last stages, very well. It suffered severe losses, and finally, due\r\nto the lack of effectives, it was found impossible to refill its\r\ndepleted ranks; its morale deteriorated and it did not fight well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1st Guard Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Gd.    │1 Gd.    │1 Gd.    │1 Gd.    │1 Gd.    │1 Gd.\r\n              │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.\r\n              │         │2 Gd.    │         │2 Gd.    │         │2 Gd.\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.\r\n              │15 Res.  │64 Res.  │15 Res.  │64 Res.  │         │64 Res.\r\n              │         │93 Res.  │         │93 Res.  │         │\r\n              │Gd.

At the beginning of the war the 1st Guard Reserve Division forming,\r\ntogether with the 3d Guard Division, the Guard Reserve Corps swept into\r\nBelgium—as part of the 2d Army under von Buelow—the 16th of August,\r\ncrossed the Meuse at Ardenne (massacres) the 20th, and pushed on as far\r\nas Namur. On the 29th the two divisions (Guard Reserve Corps) were\r\nbrought back to Aix-la-Chapelle, and left for east Prussia September 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n2. The beginning of October the Guard Reserve Corps, attached to the\r\nSouthern Army Group, took part in the invasion of the southern part of\r\nPoland, fought at Opatow (Oct. 4), and suffered severe losses at Lodz\r\nwhile retreating from the Russian armies.\r\n\r\n3. During the winter of 1914–15 it fought on the Bzura.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1915, the Guard Reserve Corps was split up. The 1st\r\nGuard Reserve Division was sent to the north of the Vistula, in the\r\nMlawa-Prasnysz region. By the 6th of March the 1st Guard Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment had already had its thirty-ninth engagement there\r\n(letter).\r\n\r\n2. In March the 93d Reserve Regiment was attached to the 4th Guard\r\nDivision (new). During the summer of 1915 the 1st Guard Reserve Division\r\nwas engaged in the operations to the north of the Vistula (von\r\nGallwitz’s army).\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n3. The pursuit of the Russians brought the division as far as the\r\nneighborhood of Smogorni-Vishnev, where it took part in violent fighting\r\nand where it was relieved the middle of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. During the early days of October it entrained at Grodno for the\r\nwestern front. (Itinerary: Warsaw, Posen, Berlin, Hanover, Aix-la-\r\nChapelle, Liège, Cambrai.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n5. It went into rest cantonments on the banks of the Scheldt between\r\nMarcoing and Bouchain (November-December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 1st Guard Reserve Division and the 4th Guard Division then formed\r\nthe reconstituted Guard Reserve Corps.\r\n\r\n2. During January and February, 1916, the division was employed on\r\ndefensive works in the Wytschaete-Messines sector; it also held a sector\r\nin that region. At the same time it underwent a course of training in\r\nthe neighborhood of Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. The beginning of May the division took over the sector south of\r\nNeuville-St. Vaast.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of July it was engaged on the Somme (Belloy-Barleux).\r\n\r\n5. After August 19 it spent some days at rest near Cambrai, and came\r\nback into line until September 8 between the Mouquet Farm and\r\nMartinpuich. It suffered local attacks, in which it was constantly\r\npushed back with heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. After a rest in the neighborhood of Cambrai it was sent to a calm\r\nsector to the north of Ypres, near the Ypres-Pilkem road.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. November 5 the division returned to the Somme (Warlencourt) where it\r\nspent the winter of 1916–17.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1917, the 1st Guard Reserve Division commenced the\r\nwithdrawal movement on the Hindenburg Line, leaving prisoners in rear-\r\nguard actions (PysGrevillers region). It was withdrawn from the front\r\nabout March 20 to go to rest near Tournai.\r\n\r\n2. The 1st Guard Reserve Division and the 4th Guard Division then became\r\nindependent divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. April 25 the division took over the Oppy-Gavrelle sector and fought\r\noff the British attacks.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved the beginning of May, it was sent to rest at Templeuve, and\r\nwas later employed in the construction of defensive works near Cambrai\r\n(May).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. The 1st of June it was carried to Tourcoing, and from there to\r\nWarneton, June 8 it went into line to the east of Messines, where it\r\nrelieved the 3d Bavarian Division, very much worn out the day before. It\r\nwas itself withdrawn as early as the 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. The division then went back to Artois and held the Moeuvres-Pronville\r\nfront (June 21–22 to Aug. 16) taking part in no important action.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n7. After some days rest at Douai, it became reengaged August 21, on the\r\nLens front, in a series of very heavy conflicts following the attack of\r\nAugust 15. The 64th Reserve Infantry Regiment was particularly\r\nexhausted. Gas attacks caused it to suffer equally heavy losses in\r\nSeptember and December.\r\n\r\n8. The division remained in this sector until the end of 1917. In\r\nNovember it sent some elements to reinforce the Cambrai front against\r\nthe British attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was recruited in all provinces of Prussia, like the rest of\r\nthe Guard. Despite their numbers, the 64th and 93d Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiments do not come (to any considerable extent) from the 3d and 4th\r\nCorps Districts. The 93d Reserve Infantry Regiments came from what was,\r\nbefore its dissolution, a “guard landwehr battalion (Magdeburg)” (seal\r\nof pay book).\r\n\r\nThe 1st Guard Reserve Division is not above the average German division\r\nin value. The Alsatians in its ranks were withdrawn and sent to Russia\r\nin 1916, but there are still numerous Poles, who do not constitute an\r\nelement of strength. It seems much less to be feared than most of the\r\nPrussian organizations that do not have the “Litze” (braiding), less,\r\ntoo, than the Wurttemburgers of the 13th Corps District and the better\r\nBavarian troops. (British document, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n1. The 1st Guard Reserve Division was relieved in the Lens sector by the\r\n220th Division the first of the year and was withdrawn, remaining at\r\nrest in this region until it relieved the 220th Division, February 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARVIN.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved by the 220th Division February 20 and went\r\nto the Carvin area, where it went through a course of training in open\r\nwarfare so as to become the assault division of the Souchez Group.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The opening day of the March 21 offensive the division was identified\r\nat Lagnicourt (northeast of Bapaume). It was very probably “leap-\r\nfrogged” by some other division the next day, but it reappeared the 27th\r\nnear Bucquoy, in a straight line with the advance taken as a whole. It\r\nsuffered exceedingly heavy losses, finally having to utilize its\r\npioneers as Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n4. April 20 the division was withdrawn from the Somme front and marched\r\nto Givenchy (just north of the La Bassée Canal) the next day, where it\r\nrelieved the 4th Ersatz Division. It fought there until about May 21,\r\ngiving a good account of itself, considering its weakened condition, and\r\nas a result its brigade commander was promoted a lieutenant general, and\r\nthe division commander received Pour le Mérite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMMONT.\r\n\r\n5. The division moved to the Grammont area, where it underwent a course\r\nof training with artillery and aeroplanes in preparation for a coming\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n6. It relieved the 38th Division at Festubert, north of the La Bassée\r\nCanal July 5; it was relieved July 14 by the 18th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested in the Fauquissart area, and then relieved the\r\n12th Reserve Division north of Hinges the night of August 2–3. It was\r\nrelieved about August 26 by extension of front of the neighboring\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n8. The 2d of September the division reinforced the front north of the\r\nArras-Cambrai Road. About the 10th it side-slipped south, for it was\r\nidentified southwest of Moeuvres. It remained here, suffering heavy\r\ncasualties (450 prisoners), and was relieved by the 7th Cavalry Division\r\nduring the night of September 22–23.\r\n\r\n9. It remained in this region, however, and was thrown back into line in\r\nattempt to stem the British advance, being identified at Bourlon\r\nSeptember 28; withdrawn about October 5.\r\n\r\n10. The division returned October 16–17, relieving the 30th Division\r\neast of Neuvilly, and was withdrawn about the 20th.\r\n\r\n11. November 4 it was identified north of Landrecies. It took part in\r\nthe general retirement, being identified south of Berlaimont November 5,\r\nand east of Maubeuge on the 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Guard Reserve Division was rated as in the first of four\r\nclasses. During 1918 it did not fight brilliantly, but it was always to\r\nbe depended upon. It was called upon to fight much in heavy engagements,\r\nand suffered very severe losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Guard Ersatz Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │           1914–15           │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Gd.

In reserve during the battle on the 20th, it crossed\r\nthe frontier on the 23d with the 6th Army, fought southeast of Lunéville\r\nthe first days of September, and toward the end of the same month it\r\nwent to Haye (Woevre).\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n1. There it formed part of the Ersatz Corps and held various sectors of\r\nthe region until March, 1916 (St. Baussant, Flirey, Bois de Mort-Mare,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1916, the 1st Guard Ersatz Mixed Bde. (6th and 7th Guard\r\nRegiments) left the Apremont region to go to the north of Combres and to\r\nthe south of Fresnes-en-Woevre.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. After a rest of 10 days at St. Marie aux Chênes (Apr. 24-May 3) it\r\nwent to the front north of Verdun. May 11–12 it entered line in the\r\nBois-Nawé (west of Douaumont), where it took part in several attacks\r\n(notably that of May 25). It rested in June, and fought again, beginning\r\nJuly 1, to the southeast of the Thiaumont works.\r\n\r\n3. The 5th Guard Ersatz Mixed Bde. which had remained in the Montsec\r\nregion, entrained at Vigneulles-St. Benoît (July 23–26), detrained at\r\nSpincourt, and during the night of August 3–4 entered line to the east\r\nof Fleury. Together with the 1st Bde., it took part in the attack of\r\nAugust 5, and both suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. The Guard Ersatz Division was withdrawn from line the end of August,\r\nafter having lost 50 per cent of its infantry before Verdun.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLIREY-EN-HAYE.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest in the region west of Spincourt it went back into line\r\nto the north of Flirey-en-Haye; it remained there until about the 5th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nIn September the 357th and the 358th Infantry Regiments were attached to\r\nthe Bavarian Ersatz Division and the 214th Division, respectively. The\r\nGuard Ersatz Division received in exchange a regiment newly formed from\r\ncompanies taken from the 6th and 7th Guard and the 357th Infantry\r\nRegiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTE DU POIVRE.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested in November, leaving December 18 to go to the\r\nregion north of Côte du Poivre, following the French attack of December\r\n15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. About January 15, 1917, the Guard Ersatz Division was withdrawn from\r\nthe Verdun front and sent to Champagne (St. Hilaire sector).\r\n\r\n2. Relieved toward the end of March, the division was sent to reserve in\r\nthe Chateau-Porcien region, which it quitted April 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. April 16 and the days following elements of the division\r\ncounterattacked toward Bermericourt; then relieving (Apr. 18) the\r\nremnants of the 21st Division, the Guard Ersatz Division went through\r\nthe French attack of May 4. It left this front soon after.\r\n\r\n4. May; rest in rear of the Champagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. After a stay in a sector in Haye to the north of Flirey (from the\r\nbeginning of June to the middle of July), the division was carried to\r\nthe eastern front (July 23–27). (Itinerary: Sarrebrucken, Kreuznach,\r\nFrankfort, Leipsic, Cottbus, Glogau, Warsaw, Grodno, Vilna.)\r\n\r\n6. The Kaiser reviewed the division July 29. From the 1st to the 17th of\r\nAugust it was trained in open warfare near Vilna.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGA.\r\n\r\n7. Taken to Chavli (Aug. 28), then to the Gross-Ekkau region, the\r\ndivision entered line in the Uxkuell region and participated in the Riga\r\noffensive, entering Riga September 3–4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n8. September 8 the division entrained for the western front. (Itinerary:\r\nChavli, Kovno, Eydtkuhnen, Insterberg, Posen, Cottbus, Leipsic,\r\nFrankfort, Thionville, Briey.) It encamped near Spincourt, and then,\r\nabout October 10, entered line to the north of Bezonvaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe Guard Ersatz Division was recruited all over Prussia just as all the\r\nother Guard divisions.\r\n\r\nGood division. The 6th and 7th Guard Regiments are not to be considered\r\nas tried troops. The 399th Infantry Regiment seems to have but a slight\r\ncombative value.\r\n\r\nThe men are said to have shown dissatisfaction when they left Russia for\r\nthe western front. Desertions are said to have taken place en route.\r\n(Inter. pris. Dec. 15–17.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained north of Verdun until February 20, when it was\r\nrelieved and went to Damvillers, entrained, and went to the Arlon area\r\nand was trained until March 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It entrained at Arlon on that date and traveled via Charleroi to\r\nMons, where it arrived the following day. By night marches the division\r\npassed through Maubeuge-Bavai-Englefontaine-Fontaine au Bois-Bazuel-Le\r\nCateau-Busigny-Bohain-Fresnoy-Péronne, without taking part in any\r\nfighting. It came into line March 25–26, and was heavily engaged at\r\nProyart the 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGARD.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn about April 6, after having large\r\ncasualties, and reinforced the front near Hangard the night of April\r\n9–10, not being relieved until about May 4. Flanking divisions extended\r\ntheir fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONS.\r\n\r\n4. It rested northwest of Mons until the end of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. It then went to reserve in Champagne, and entered line west of\r\nAuberive July 15. It was withdrawn on the 21st.\r\n\r\n\r\nOULCHY LE CHATEAU.\r\n\r\n6. The division was identified in line north of Oulchy le Chateau July\r\n29, where it fought until withdrawn, about August 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n7. It went into rest cantonments at Helfrantzkirch (northeast of Basle),\r\nand remained there until September 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n8. Prisoners of the division were captured southwest of Roulers, and\r\nthey stated that it entered line October 5–6. The division remained in\r\nline fighting stubbornly, but to no purpose, until withdrawn, November\r\n7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nReliable information is to the effect that the Guard Ersatz, the Guard\r\nCavalry, and the Jaeger Divisions bore the title “Oberste Heeresleitungs\r\nAngriffsdivisionen,” and that they were held under the direct control of\r\nthe Supreme Command. Nevertheless, the Guard Ersatz has always been\r\nconsidered as being in the second of four classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Guard Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                        │                     1918\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n                        │       Brigade.        │       Regiment.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Infantry.              │5 Ldw.

The 1st Army Corps was engaged on the Russian front at the very\r\nbeginning of the war.\r\n\r\n2. Up until November the 1st Division participated in the operations of\r\nEast Prussia, and notably in the battle of Tannenberg (Aug. 27–29).\r\n\r\n3. In December the two divisions of the 1st Corps separated. The 2d\r\nDivision remained in the north; the 1st Division went to the 9th Army,\r\nfrom December, 1914, to January, 1915 (Bzura-Rawka), then to the Army of\r\nthe South, operating in the Carpathians and on the Dniester, from\r\nFebruary, 1915, to February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. The division went to France in March, 1916. The 41st Infantry\r\nRegiment detrained March 13 near Metz; the 48th Infantry Regiment at\r\nHagondange March 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. The division was put in line near Vaux April 20, fought in the bois\r\nde la Caillette in May, in the bois de Vaux Chapitre, and the bois Fumin\r\nin June and July. It suffered enormous losses there. In the 1st Company\r\nof the 41st Infantry Regiment, the numbers on the pay books passed from\r\n1,359 (Apr. 10) to 1,674 (July 19), indicating the arrival of at least\r\n316 reinforcements. From the beginning of the war until July, 1916, the\r\nregiment had received an average of 1,360 men per company.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of July, 1916, the 1st Division, leaving behind the 41st\r\nInfantry Regiment, which fought before Verdun in August, was once more\r\ntaken to the eastern front, where it formed part of the Carpathian\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUKOVINA.\r\n\r\n1. In July, 1917, the division was in the Kirlibaba-Dorna-Vatra region.\r\nBeginning July 27, it followed up the retreating Russians, halting,\r\nearly in August, in the Sereth region.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. The division entrained, the beginning of December, near Czernowitz,\r\nand was carried to the French front. (Itinerary: Kolomea, Stanislau,\r\nLemberg, Tarnow, Oppeln, Breslau, Dresden, Leipsic, Halle, Cassel,\r\nCoblentz, Treves.) Ordered to Lorraine, it was sent to the region east\r\nof Etain, relieving the 13th Reserve Division and occupying the sector\r\nin front of Moulainville (Dec. 27; still there Jan. 23, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the regiments of the 1st Division are recruited in East\r\nPrussia, but since the 1st Corps District, sparsely populated and of\r\nrestricted size, could not keep it up alone, the elements coming from\r\noutside this district are numerous. During the stay on the eastern front\r\nAlsace-Lorrainers were used in considerable number. While in France the\r\ndivision’s ranks were filled up with the aid of the abundant resources\r\nof Brandenburg and Silesia (3rd and 4th Corps Districts); consequently,\r\nthe division does not display to any degree the local character like the\r\nmajority of the German divisions.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Division was on the Russian front from August, 1914, until\r\nDecember, 1917, with the exception of the period April-July, 1916,\r\nduring which it was engaged before Verdun.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the division fraternized with the Russians for about three\r\nweeks in April, but this came to an end early in May with the arrival\r\nopposite them of new Russian troops, who received their advances with\r\nbullets. (Inter. pris., Jan. 24, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line in the Verdun sector until relieved by\r\nthe 11th Bavarian division about February 15.\r\n\r\n2. It moved to the Conflans area, where it went through a course of\r\ntraining in open warfare in order to fit itself to become an assault\r\ndivision. At this time, too, it exchanged its Alsatians for Prussians of\r\nthe 78th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. March 27 the division reinforced the front at Bray, north of the\r\nSomme. It fought until the 30th, and lost to such an extent that its\r\ncompanies, which had been filled up while in the Conflans area, were\r\nreduced to an average strength of 40 men.\r\n\r\n4. It was withdrawn March 30, and rested immediately in rear of the\r\nposition it had held in line until about April 19.\r\n\r\n5. The following day the division went back into line just south of the\r\nSomme, and immediately suffered heavily. It was relieved May 2 by the\r\n24th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n6. The division went to rest in the Peruwelz area, and then had some\r\nmore training in the same region.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n7. Early in July the division was identified in reserve near Hirson.\r\n\r\n8. July 16 it entered line near St. Hilaire, and was withdrawn the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n9. It was immediately thrown into line in the Bois de Vrigny, where it\r\nfought in an attempt to prevent the Allies from annihilating the German\r\ntroops in the Soissons-Chateau Thierry-Rheims pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n10. About August 10 the division was withdrawn and went to rest in the\r\nregion of Laon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFFAUX.\r\n\r\n11. September 3 it relieved the 27th Division near Laffaux, and, being\r\nsurprised by a French attack, lost heavily (2,300 prisoners).\r\n\r\n12. September 16 it was relieved by the 29th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n13. The division came back into line near Betheny (northeast of Rheims)\r\non October 2 and was withdrawn about the 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. FERGEUX.\r\n\r\n14. It reentered line in the St. Fergeux region October 14, and was\r\nagain withdrawn the 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIART.\r\n\r\n15. November 7 the division was identified near Liart (south of Rocroi),\r\nand remained in line until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1st Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Res.   │1 Res.   │1 Res.   │1 Res.   │1 Res.   │1 Res.\r\n              │         │3 Res.   │         │3 Res.   │         │3 Res.\r\n              │72 Res.  │18 Res.  │72 Res.  │18 Res.  │72 Res.  │18 Res.\r\n              │         │59 Res.  │         │59 Res.  │         │59 Res.\r\n              │1 Res.   │Jag.

The 1st Reserve Division was on the Russian front from August, 1914,\r\nuntil November 1, 1917, at which time it entrained for France.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST PRUSSIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n2. In 1914 it and the 36th Reserve Division formed the 1st Reserve Corps\r\n(Gen. Otto von Buelow). It took part in the operations of East Prussia\r\n(Hindenburg’s Army), in the Lodz maneuver (Von Mackensen’s Army), and in\r\nthe combats on the Bzura.\r\n\r\n3. In February, 1915, the division was in the Prasnysz region, northeast\r\nof the Bohr-Narew line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n4. In May, as part of Eichhorn’s Army, it took part in the raid on\r\nCourland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. It was on the Dvina in the Friedrichstadt region until July.\r\n\r\n2. In August it was identified in Galicia, in Bothmer’s Army, opposed to\r\nthe Broussiloff offensive. Here it had heavy losses. (The 11th Company\r\nof the 3d Infantry Regiment, in particular, was reduced to 30 men.)\r\nDuring September the division was reinforced. The depot at\r\nFriedrichstadt, near Warsaw, was completely emptied to make good its\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of September elements of the division were in line\r\nnear Friedrichstadt, along the Dvina, in a calm sector. The 18th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was attached to the newly formed 225th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. January 5, 1917, the division was taken to the Mitau region, where it\r\nhelped stop the Russian attack. Losses in this sector were light, but\r\nthere was considerable discontent due to the cold.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved about the 15th of March and sent to the\r\nneighborhood of Gross-Eckau, near Mitau, where it rested two months.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGA.\r\n\r\n3. The middle of May it was put back into line before Riga. It took part\r\nin the offensive against that city in September, stayed there from the\r\n3d to the 7th of September, and then took up again its march toward the\r\neast. It organized its positions about 70 kilometers from Riga, near\r\nHintzenberg (or Hildersberg?) (near Wenden) and established itself\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved the end of October, it entrained near Wenden for the western\r\nfront (Itinerary: Riga, Mitau, Kovno, Eidtkuhnen, Insterburg, Thorn,\r\nPosen, Lissa, Breslau, Cottbus, Leipsic, Erfuhrt, Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nSarrebruecken, Thionville, Sedan, Vouziers.) It detrained November 6 at\r\nSemide (southeast of Vouziers).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest of two days, the division went into line in the St.\r\nHilaire sector (east of Vaudesincourt-Auberive).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was recruited in East Prussia and, as a result of\r\ninsufficient local resources, from divers other localities—a great many\r\nAlsace-Lorrainers during the sojourn on the Russian front.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Reserve Division has taken part in all the important attacks\r\nwhich have taken place on the eastern front since the beginning of the\r\nwar. It seems, however, from interrogation of deserters (in Champagne,\r\nNovember, 1917), that the cadres and men were little prepared for war as\r\nit was waged on the western front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line east of Auberive until relieved by the\r\n23d Division April 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. May 13–14 it relieved the 76th Reserve Division in the Givesnes\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n3. It was relieved August 4, but came back into line on the 10th a\r\nlittle farther to the north, in the region of Hangest-en-Santerre. It\r\nwas withdrawn a few days later and rested several days in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n4. August 19 it relieved the 75th Reserve Division near Beuvraignes. It\r\nfought until relieved September 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n5. After 10 days’ rest it relieved the 21st Division near Le Verguier,\r\nnorthwest of St. Quentin. It was withdrawn on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIBEMONT.\r\n\r\n6. October 1 the division relieved the 208th Division near Ribemont.\r\nWithdrawn October 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMPIERRE.\r\n\r\n7. It came back into line November 7 and remained until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division has suffered very heavily, notwithstanding the fact that,\r\nuntil about the 10th of August, it had taken no part in any really\r\nimportant actions this year. On the 18th of September the 1st Reserve\r\nRegiment was almost wiped out, its three battalion officers being\r\ncaptured with their staffs. It had also suffered a great many casualties\r\nthe 9th and 10th of August. It is difficult to estimate the strength of\r\nits companies, owing to the fact that it is still in an active sector,\r\nbut it is probably not over 50 rifles.\r\n\r\nIn the main the recruitment is East Prussian. There have been many\r\nAlsace-Lorrainers in its ranks, but since many of these have deserted\r\nthere are probably not a great many of them left. For the most part the\r\nmen are between 25 and 35 years old, but there are many older men and\r\nsomething less than 10 per cent of the division is made up by recruits\r\nof the 1919 class. It is again to be noted that the division was not\r\nemployed in any of the German offensives this year.\r\n\r\nIts conduct was remarkable in no way during the division’s participation\r\nin the heavy fighting around Hangest, Beuvraignes, and to the north of\r\nSt. Quentin. During the early part of the year, when the division was in\r\nline in Champagne, there were a great many desertions, especially among\r\nthe Alsace-Lorraine element. There have also been many cases of mutiny,\r\nespecially in the 59th Reserve, the worst of the three regiments. About\r\nthe middle of August a batch of some 500 recruits started out from the\r\ninterior for the division. To sustain the morale of the men, these\r\nrecruits were told they were going to simply support the artillery.\r\nNotwithstanding this, less than 250 men remained when the draft reached\r\nits true destination—the front lines. The men are very tired of the war,\r\nbut on the whole seem resigned to the necessity of doing their duty.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Reserve is rated as a third-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1st Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │6 Mixed  │34 Ldw.  │6 Ldw.   │34 Ldw.  │34 Ldw.  │31 Ldw.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │49 Ldw.  │         │49 Ldw.  │         │37 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │84 Ldw.\r\n              │34 Mixed │31 Ldw.  │34 Mixed │31 Ldw.  │         │\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │         │\r\n              │         │84 Ldw.  │         │33 Ldw.  │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │84 Ldw.  │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │90 Ldw.

It was first called the 10th Landwehr Division,\r\ntaking the name of 1st Landwehr Division in July, 1915. It comprised the\r\n6th Mixed Landwehr Brigade (34th and 49th Landwehr Regiments) and the\r\n34th Mixed Landwehr Brigade (31st and 84th Landwehr Regiments).\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST PRUSSIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n1. First engaged in East Prussia (Angerburg, Gumbinnen, August, 1914, to\r\nJanuary, 1915), Jacobi’s Division took part in the operations between\r\nMariampol and Suwalki. Early in March, 1915, it was before Lomza; then\r\nin the Ossowiec region on the Bobr. It was at this time that the\r\ndivision became known as the 1st Landwehr Division, and the 33d Landwehr\r\nRegiment was attached to it.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of August the division was in the Kalvariia region,\r\nSuwalki. It took part in the summer offensive, but remained in support,\r\nnever doing any actual fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n3. After a rest on the Little Berezina, it went to Courland, going into\r\nline in the Uxkuell region (October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained to the south of Riga until the end of July,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n2. In August it went to Volhynia, where it took over the Borovno sector\r\n(on the Stokhod) and held it for more than a year, until about November,\r\n1917. The 6th Landwehr Brigade was taken away and remained in the Mitau\r\nregion (April, 1916). Since then the division has been composed of only\r\nthree regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved in the Borovno sector toward the end of 1917, went to rest\r\nin the vicinity of Kovel. In January, 1918, the division received\r\nreinforcements from the 9th Landwehr Regiment (dissolved) and also from\r\nthe 20th Landsturm Regiment. It had already had men of the 1919 class\r\nsince November, 1917. Still more arrived in February, 1918, when the\r\ndivision was on the point of departing for Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the 31st and 84th Landwehr Regiments were recruited in the\r\n9th Corps District; the 33d Landwehr Regiment in the 1st Corps District.\r\nLatterly, however, widely diversified elements have been introduced—men\r\nof the 20th Landsturm Regiment (18th Corps District); from the 9th\r\nLandsturm Regiment (2d Corps District); also men from the 3d, 7th, and\r\n17th Districts (class 1919). There is, too, a considerable number of\r\nAlsace-Lorrainers (33d Landwehr Regiment).\r\n\r\nThe 1st Landwehr is a mediocre division, composed of old men and of\r\nothers that have little military value. (March, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. The division was then taken to the western front, and after some time\r\nspent in reserve (it was probably trained in the methods of warfare\r\nemployed on the western front, although there is no evidence to\r\nestablish it) it relieved the 35th Division near Merckem, March 20. It\r\nwas relieved about April 19 by elements of the 83d Division.\r\n\r\n2. April 26 it was identified in the St. Julien-Hooge sector, replacing\r\npart of the 236th Division, which side slipped to the south. In an\r\nunsuccessful attack during this time it suffered exceedingly heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was relieved by the 6th Cavalry Division during the\r\nnight of July 27–28 and went to rest in the Vosges.\r\n\r\n4. About October 3 the division relieved the 30th Bavarian Reserve\r\nDivision near Aspach le Bas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n5. It was withdrawn from this sector soon afterwards to be thrown in to\r\nmeet the American advance east of the Meuse, being identified west of\r\nFlabas October 16. They lost heavily, staying in until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Landwehr is rated as a third-class division. Still, although\r\nmany of its younger men were sent to other divisions just before it came\r\nto the western front, it did rather well, its commanding officer having\r\nbeen promoted after its participation in the battle of the Lys, and the\r\ndivision as a whole having been lauded several times in the official\r\ncommuniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1st Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Bav.   │Body Inf.│1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.\r\n              │         │1 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │         │1 Bav.\r\n              │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │         │24 Bav.  │         │24 Bav.\r\n              │         │16 Bav.  │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │8 Bav.

At the beginning of the war the 1st Bavarian Division, forming, with\r\nthe 2d Bavarian Division, the 1st Bavarian Corps, was part of the 6th\r\nArmy (Bavarian Crown Prince). It detrained at Sarrebruecken (Aug. 8–9),\r\ncrossed the frontier, sacked Badonviller the 12th, and withdrew to the\r\nnorth of Sarrebruecken the 17th. It fought at Sarrebruecken the 20th. In\r\nliaison on the left with the Badeners of the 14th Corps, it crossed the\r\nfrontier and advanced to Nossoncourt and Xaffévillers (Sept. 6) via\r\nBaccarat. September 12 the division, having been withdrawn, was\r\nreassembled at Peltre (near Metz). It then entrained at Metz the 14th\r\nand 15th, and detrained near Namur, reaching Péronne the 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. In the last days of September, 1914, at the time of the “race to the\r\nsea,” the two divisions of the 1st Bavarian Corps were in the 2d Army\r\n(Von Buelow), which operated on the Somme in the Péronne region. They\r\nbecame heavily engaged notably at Combles (Oct. 24) and at Maricourt\r\n(Dec. 17). By November 4 the 1st Bavarian Regiment had had casualties of\r\n63 officers and 2,090 men since the beginning of the war. (Casualty\r\nlist.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The 1st Bavarian Division was kept in line on the Somme (Dompierre-\r\nMaricourt) until October, 1915. Its composition was changed—the Body\r\nInfantry Regiment went to the Alpine Corps, the 16th Infantry to the\r\n10th Bavarian Division. In return, the 24th Infantry (a new formation)\r\nwas received.\r\n\r\n2. The division was taken to the region north of Arras (Neuville-Souchez\r\nsector), where it remained almost seven months (October, 1915-May,\r\n1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. About May, 1916, the division was relieved to the west of Vimy and\r\nsent to the Verdun front, where it took part in the battles near\r\nDouaumont (May 23), and in those of June 1 and 8.\r\n\r\n2. Re-formed in the Romagne-sous-les-Côtes area, it reentered line about\r\nJune 22 for new attacks. During this offensive the division suffered\r\nseverely. It was relieved at the beginning of July.\r\n\r\n3. After a short rest behind the Verdun front the division reoccupied\r\nthe Apremont-St. Mihiel sector, remaining there until October 11, when\r\nit was reconstituted, receiving large reinforcements (recuperates and\r\nmen of the 1916 class).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Taken to the Caudry sector (near Cambrai), it was engaged on the\r\nSomme (Sailly-Saillisel, Morval) October 13 to end of November, where\r\nits losses were once again exceedingly heavy.\r\n\r\n5. The division reappeared in the region of St. Mihiel (Bois d’Ailly-\r\nForêt d’Apremont sector) the beginning of December, and remained there\r\nuntil the early days of May, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATEAU DE CALIFORNIE.\r\n\r\n1. Entrained about May 7 at Vigneulles, it proceeded to the Laon region,\r\nwhere it was in reserve (May 8–12). The following day it took over the\r\nsector west of Hurtebise, where it participated in several attacks (May\r\n20-June 17), losing heavily therein.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved June 21 and went to rest south of Mezieres\r\n(La Francheville, etc.), where it was reconstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. July 25 it went back into line on the Champagne front (sector south\r\nof Ste. Marie-a-Py); it did not take part in any important engagements\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n4. The division was withdrawn December 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was recruited in the southern part of Bavaria. The presence\r\nof contingents from the Bavarian Alps was responsible for the withdrawal\r\nof the Body Regiment to form the Alpine Corps.\r\n\r\nDespite the losses it suffered during May and June in the Hurtebise\r\nsector, the 1st Bavarian Division may still be considered a good\r\ndivision. It has had time to reconstitute itself during the long calm\r\nperiod spent in Champagne (July 25-Dec. 27, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from line, the division was put through a course of\r\ntraining. It relieved the 80th Reserve Division north of Vauquois\r\nFebruary 17.\r\n\r\n2. It was relieved by the 80th Reserve Division about the 1st of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n3. The opening day of the March offensive the division reinforced the\r\nfront south of St. Quentin. It was withdrawn the next day.\r\n\r\n4. March 23 it came back into line north of Chauny. It was withdrawn\r\nabout the 30th.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n5. April 6 it relieved the 3d Bavarian Division west of Lassigny. It was\r\nin turn relieved by the 3d Bavarian Division on the 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. Having suffered a great deal in the fighting on the Somme, the\r\ndivision was taken to a quiet sector in Champagne, relieving the 52d\r\nReserve Division May 1 north of Souain. About June 30 it was relieved by\r\nthe 30th Division.\r\n\r\n7. It reinforced the front near Souain July 15. It was withdrawn about\r\nthe 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n8. The division entered line northeast of Soissons August 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n9. It was relieved by the Jaeger Division about August 19, and moved to\r\nthe west, taking over the Cuts sector, southeast of Noyon, August 20,\r\nand was withdrawn the 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUCY-LE-CHATEAU.\r\n\r\n10. August 31 the division was identified at Folembray, northwest of\r\nCoucy-le-Chateau; withdrawn about September 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n11. About September 27 it took over the Manre sector, southeast of\r\nVouziers, where it remained, fighting, until the signing of the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Bavarian is rated as a first-class assault division; it was\r\nutilized as such throughout 1918. It fought well; its losses were\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1st Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.\r\n              │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.\r\n              │         │2 Bav.   │         │2 Bav.   │         │2 Bav.\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.\r\n              │2 Bav.   │3 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │3 Bav.   │         │3 Bav.\r\n              │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │         │  Res.\r\n              │         │12 Bav.  │         │12 Bav.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.   │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Bav.

The Bavarian Reserve Division (1st Bavarian Reserve Corps, with the\r\n5th Bavarian Reserve Division) was at the beginning of the war part of\r\nthe 6th Army (Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria), and detrained in Lorraine\r\nAugust 13–14. After having helped to check the French offensive in\r\nLorraine, participated in the battle of August 20, entered Luneville,\r\nand after having fought at Einville, early in September, it went to rest\r\nin the vicinity of the Paris-Avricourt railroad, and later march to Metz\r\nby stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n2. September 27–28 the division entrained at Metz and was carried to\r\nCambrai. Entering line between Douai and Arras, it fought at Izel,\r\nGavrelle, Rouvroy (Oct. 2–3). On the 5th its right wing was at Souchez,\r\nthe whole 1st Bavarian Reserve Corps being then in line north of Arras.\r\nOctober 23 the two divisions of the corps attacked violently along the\r\nCarency-Roclincourt front; they remained in line until June, 1915, the\r\n1st Bavarian Division being between Roclincourt and Écurie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUVILLE-ST. VAAST.\r\n\r\n1. In May, 1915, the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division was engaged at\r\nNeuville-St. Vaast, when it was reinforced by two battalions of the 99th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment. The 2d Bavarian Reserve Regiment suffered\r\ncasualties of 14 officers and 1,413 men (casualty list).\r\n\r\n\r\nLE LABYRINTHE.\r\n\r\n2. In June the division fought at the Labyrinth.\r\n\r\n3. It continued to hold the sector north of the Scarpe, but moved toward\r\nthe south in December, the front of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Corps\r\nextending as far as Blaireville.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line east of Arras, straddling the Scarpe\r\nuntil August, 1916. From May to August, it comprised the 12th Bavarian\r\nReserve Regiment, instead of the 3d Bavarian Reserve Regiment, loaned\r\ntemporarily by the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn August 8, it went to the Somme. It was engaged the 12th in\r\nthe Clery sector, and was relieved as early as the 15th by the 1st Guard\r\nDivision after having suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n3. The second fortnight in August the division was at rest near Cambrai.\r\nThe end of that month and early in September, some elements of the\r\ndivision were engaged near Clery and Martinpuich in order to facilitate\r\nreliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. About the middle of September the 1st Bavarian Reserve Corps was\r\nwithdrawn from the region of the Somme and sent to the Aisne, where the\r\n1st Bavarian Reserve Division occupied a sector to the west of Craonne\r\nuntil the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n5. Brought back north of the Somme, it sent some elements into line in\r\nthe Beaumont-Hamel sector (north of the Ancre, December-January).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. After sometime at rest, the division went back into line February 27\r\nto the north of Arras (Roclincourt-Neuville-St. Vaast). April 9 it\r\nreceived the full shock of the British attack—lost the villages of\r\nThelus and Bailleul and 1,500 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about the 15th of April, the division rested, and then\r\nentered line north of the La Bassée Canal (east of Festubert). It\r\nremained here five months, taking no part in any important engagements\r\nbut suffering losses as a result of gas attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. It left for Belgium October 6–7, and took over the Zandvoorde sector\r\n(southeast of Ypres) on the 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Bavarian Reserve Division is a good division, but its combatant\r\nvalue can not be compared to that of the active Bavarian divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. Here it remained in line until February 11, when it was relieved by\r\nthe 239th Division and withdrawn to rest in the Menin area, before it\r\nhad suffered many casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIXMUDE.\r\n\r\n2. March 9 it relieved the 54th Reserve Division in the Dixmude sector.\r\nIt was relieved on the 22d by the extension of the fronts of the\r\nneighboring divisions.\r\n\r\n3. It marched to Zedelghem the same day, and reached Seclin on the 23d.\r\nThe 28th it came into reserve near Douai. It was undoubtedly intended to\r\nreinforce the German attack on the Arras front on the 28th, but as this\r\nwas a complete failure, it returned to the Carvin area.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYS.\r\n\r\n4. April 9 the division reinforced the front near Richebourg-St. Vaast,\r\nand took part in the initial attack on the Lys battle front the same\r\nday. It advanced through Lacouture, Vieille-Chapelle, and had reached\r\nZelobes April 10. After the first day’s fighting it met with a strong\r\nresistance and suffered heavily. It was relieved near Robecq by the\r\n239th Division, April 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOS.\r\n\r\n5. April 27 the division relieved elements of the 207th Division east of\r\nLoos (south of the La Bassee Canal).\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n6. It was relieved by the 16th Division about September 27, marched to\r\nCarvin, which it left September 29, and entrained at Seclin for Heule,\r\nwhence it marched into line via Moorseele. It was identified near\r\nRoulers October 4. It was relieved by the 6th Cavalry Division October\r\n16.\r\n\r\n7. After a rest of only a few days the division came back into line on\r\nthe 23d to the south of Deynze, whence it was withdrawn about October\r\n31. It did not return to line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Bavarian Reserve Division took part in no real fighting with the\r\nexception of the Lys offensive, in which it did nothing to distinguish\r\nitself. It would seem that the division does not deserve to be rated\r\nhigher than third in a scale of four classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1st Bavarian Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │13 Bav.  │8 Bav.   │5 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │5 Bav.   │4 Bav.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │10 Bav.  │         │5 Bav.   │         │5 Bav.\r\n              │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │14 Bav.  │15 Bav.  │14 Bav.  │15 Bav.  │9 Bav.   │6 Bav.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Mixed  │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │  Ldw.   │\r\n              │         │122 Ldw. │         │122 Ldw. │         │7 Bav.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Ldw.\r\n              │60 Mixed │60 Ldw.  │13 Bav.  │8 Bav.   │13 Bav.  │8 Bav.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.   │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │71 Ldw.  │         │10 Bav.  │         │10 Bav.\r\n              │         │         │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │60 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │1st Sqn. 2d Bav.   │1st Sqn. 2d Bav.\r\n              │                   │  Corps Dist.

The origin of the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Division dates from the\r\nstabilization of the Lorraine front after the check of the Germans\r\nbefore Grand-Couronne in September, 1914.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of the war the different elements which were to\r\nenter into the composition of the division were employed in Lorraine in\r\nrear of the combatant troops. The 71st Landwehr Regiment came from the\r\nwar garrison of Strasburg.\r\n\r\n3. These elements grouped in three brigades forming the 1st Bavarian\r\nLandwehr Division, were brought up to the front early in September and\r\nput into line in the Château-Salins sector (from Jallaucourt to the\r\nRhine-Marne Canal).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. From that time on the division occupied the same front in Lorraine,\r\non each side of the Rhine-Marne Canal, broadening or narrowing its front\r\naccording to the number of troops in line in the region.\r\n\r\n2. During the summer of 1915 its limit was carried to the southeast\r\ngradually as far as the Luneville-Avricourt railway, next to the region\r\nsouth of Leintrey; to the northeast as far as the western ledge of the\r\nForet de Bezange.\r\n\r\n3. In May, 1915, the 60th Landwehr Bde. was detached from the division,\r\nand replaced by the 5th Bavarian Landwehr Bde. (4th and 5th Bavarian\r\nLandwehr Regiments) coming from the 10th Ersatz Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. South of Leintrey—western edge of the Foret de Bezange. In January,\r\n1916, the 14th Bavarian Landwehr Bde. was detached from the 1st Bavarian\r\nLandwehr Division; the 122d Landwehr Regiment (Wurttemburg) passed to\r\nthe 2d Landwehr Division; the 15th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment to the\r\n39th Bavarian Landwehr Division. The brigade was replaced by the 9th\r\nBavarian Landwehr Bde. (6th and 7th Bavarian Landwehr Regiments). The\r\ndivision thus became entirely Bavarian; it was increased, shortly after,\r\nby the addition of the 60th Reserve Regiment, which was later\r\n(September) attached to the 221st Division.\r\n\r\n2. In July, 1916, the 13th Bavarian Landwehr Bde. was withdrawn from the\r\ndivision and replaced by battalions of Landsturm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the division’s sector was shortened—it was limited\r\non the southeast by the western edge of the Foret de Paroy. In March it\r\nended northwest of Juvrecourt. In June it extended itself once more to\r\nthe southeast, fixing itself finally in July between Juvrecourt and the\r\neastern edge of the Foret de Paroy; the limits have not varied since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n2. About the first of the year the 5th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment passed\r\nto the 2d Bavarian Landwehr Division (new formation—Russian front).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Bavarian Landwehr Division established itself on the Lorraine\r\nfront in September, 1914, after the hard fighting in that region had\r\nceased. It executed some important raids with its assault company,\r\nnotably in June, 1917 (Foret de Paroy), and November (Arracourt region).\r\nIn general, however, it remained exclusively on the defensive. It is\r\nmade up of men whose physical value is often diminished; who have,\r\nconsequently, waged only position warfare, and that upon a defensive\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Parroy sector in Lorraine throughout\r\n1918, and, with the exception of a very few raids executed by the\r\ndivisional Stosstrupp, did nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nLosses and reinforcements have been few. The strength of the companies\r\nappears to be about 80 men, of an average age of 35–40 years. The 1st\r\nBavarian Landwehr is rated as a fourth-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1st Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                        │                     1918\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n                        │       Brigade.        │       Regiment.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Cavalry.               │1 Cav.

At the beginning of the war the Field Army contained only one naval\r\ndivision. This division entered Belgium on September 4, 1914, detrained\r\nat Brussels, and on September 6 took up its position to the left of the\r\ncorps which was besieging Antwerp. After the taking of the city on\r\nOctober 10 the division marched along the coast, arrived at a point\r\nbetween Ostend and Bruges on October 23, and on November 2 relieved the\r\n4th Ersatz Division on the front of Nieuport-St. Georges.\r\n\r\n2. On November 24, 1914, the Naval Corps was formed by adding a 2d Naval\r\nDivision to the 1st.\r\n\r\n3. After this time the Naval Corps occupied the sea front and the sector\r\nof the coast in occupied Flanders. The staffs of the 1st and 2d Naval\r\nDivisions were permanently in command of this sector—the sea front (from\r\nRaversyde to the frontier of Zeeland as far as Maldegem was assigned to\r\nthe 1st Naval Division; the front on land from the North Sea to\r\nSchoorbakke, 4 kilometers southeast Nieuport, to the 2d Naval Division).\r\nThe six regiments of Marine Fusileers alternated between the two\r\nsectors, and consequently changed from one division to the other.\r\n\r\n4. In April, 1917, the three naval infantry regiments were withdrawn\r\nfrom the 1st and 2d Naval Divisions to organize a new Division, the 3d\r\nNaval Division. These regiments had already formed a provisional\r\ndivision, from the end of September, 1916, to January, 1917, when they\r\nwere engaged on the Somme. After fighting east of Ypres (August to\r\nNovember, 1917), the 3d Naval Division came into line at Nieuport\r\n(Lombartzyde) to the right of the 2d Naval Division in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe Marine or Sailor Fusileers, recruited at the beginning of the war\r\nfrom among the seamen or the population of the ports, had only a\r\nmediocre combat value at the time.\r\n\r\nSince 1917, in consequence of reinforcements taken from the land army,\r\nand also in consequence of reducing the age of the effectives, the\r\nregiments of Naval Fusileers seem to be of better quality.\r\n\r\nFrom a recruiting standpoint, they may be compared with the active\r\ndivisions of the German Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was out of line in 1918 until May 1. From that date\r\nuntil November 4 it held the extreme right of the German line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class. Until the last month of the war\r\nits front was quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           2d Guard Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │3 Gd.    │1 Gren.  │3 Gd.    │1 Gren.  │3 Gd.    │1 Gren.\r\n              │         │3 Gren.  │         │3 Gren.  │         │3 Gren.\r\n              │4 Gd.    │2 Gren.  │4 Gd.    │2 Gren.  │4 Gd.    │2 Gren.\r\n              │         │4 Gren.  │         │4 Gren.  │         │4 Gren.\r\n              │5 Gd.    │5 Gren.  │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │5 Ft.    │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │4 Gd.

The 2d Guard Division remained in the sector of the region Noyon-Roye\r\nuntil August, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. On August 15 it was sent to the Somme region (Chilly), where it\r\nsuffered heavy losses both to the north and to the south of Peronne.\r\n\r\n3. From October 1 to the end of December, 1916, it fought for a second\r\ntime south of Peronne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1.

It\r\nsuffered heavy losses in the Aisne sector in May, 1917. However, even\r\nafter this attack the morale of the men on the whole seemed quite high.\r\nAt the Malmaison attack, October 23, the troops of the division, after\r\nthree days, were completely defeated.\r\n\r\nDuring the last battles the division showed only moderate fighting\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

It went then via Marchiennes (Mar.\r\n20–21), Montigny (Mar. 21–22), to Lambres, where it arrived the evening\r\nof March 22. After 5 days’ rest here the division moved up to the line\r\nat Vitry-en-Artois (Mar. 27) to reinforce the front for the attack north\r\nof the Scarpe on the 28th. Except for one battalion of the 1st Guard\r\nGrenadier Regiment, the division took part in the fighting, as the\r\nattack was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOREUIL.\r\n\r\n3. The following day it marched via Arleux-Morchies-Beaumetz-\r\nHaplincourt-Le Fansloy-Les Boeufs-Maricourt, crossing the Somme at\r\nSuzanne-Proyart-Framerville-Caix-Mézières. It went into reserve east of\r\nMailly-Raineval, where it remained until April 5, when it came into line\r\nnorth of Rouvrel. It was relieved by the 6th Reserve Division May 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division reinforced the Aisne battle front about May 26 to the\r\nwest of Vailly. It was relieved, June 17, by the 40th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest in the Marle region the division reinforced the front\r\nnear Chatillon-sur-Marne July 15. It was withdrawn on the 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n6. August 27 the division reinforced the front south of the Somme near\r\nDompierre. It was relieved, September 3, by the Alpine Corps, after\r\nsuffering heavy losses, and losing 1,450 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE CATELET.\r\n\r\n7. During the night of September 11–12 it reinforced the front near\r\nRonssoy (west of Le Catelet). It was withdrawn October 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n8. After resting a fortnight the division relieved the 52d Reserve\r\nDivision at Machelen, October 24. It was relieved by the 6th Cavalry\r\nDivision November 4, and did not return to line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Guard Division is rated as a first-class assault division. It\r\nparticipated in a great deal of heavy fighting during 1918 and always\r\nacquitted itself very well. It was mentioned in the official communiqués\r\non several occasions. Between the end of August and October 9 it had\r\nlost 2,800 in prisoners alone. Indeed, its losses must have been very\r\nheavy, since there is positive evidence at hand to show that it received\r\n4,000 replacements between August 10 and October 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2d Guard Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │26 Res.  │15 Res.  │26 Res.  │15 Res.  │26 Res.  │15 Res.\r\n              │         │55 Res.  │         │55 Res.  │         │55 Res.\r\n              │38 Res.  │77 Res.  │38 Res.  │77 Res.  │38 Res.  │77 Res.\r\n              │         │91 Res.  │         │91 Res.  │         │91 Res.\r\n              │ 10 Res.

At the beginning of the war the 2d Reserve Guard Division was grouped\r\nwith the 19th Reserve Division in the 10th Reserve Corps. This corps\r\nformed a part of the Second German Army (Von Bülow).\r\n\r\nThe division entrained at Zulpich August 10, entered Belgium the 14th,\r\npassed the Meuse near Liege the 17th, surrounded Namur on the north,\r\ncrossed the Sambre to the west of Charleroi on the 22d, fought at\r\nMarbaix the 23d, and the 29th and 30th at Ribemont and St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE-CHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. The 2d Reserve Guard Division was engaged in the battle of the Marne\r\nbetween Sezanne and Montmirail (Sept. 6–7). It retreated through Epernay\r\nand fought on the Rheims front. It held its position on this front\r\n(Courcy sector) up to the month of February, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. Toward the middle of February, 1915, the two brigades of the 2d\r\nReserve Guard Division were separated. The 26th Brigade went into the\r\nline between Thiescourt and the Oise and the 38th Brigade went to the\r\nforest of the Argonne.\r\n\r\n2. Regrouped in Alsace in the vicinity of Schlestadt toward the end of\r\nApril, the 2d Reserve Guard Division was transported about May 20 to the\r\ndistrict of La Bassee. It was engaged in the Cuinchy-Givenchy sector\r\n(June-July).\r\n\r\n3. About the 1st of August the division was sent to rest east of\r\nCambrai.\r\n\r\n4. In September it occupied the sector of Vingles-Hulluch to the south\r\nof the La Bassee Canal. September 25–26 it took part in the third battle\r\nof the Artois and suffered great losses. Portions of the 2d Reserve\r\nGuard Division participated in the attack near Loos October 8.\r\n\r\n5. The division remained in the district of La Bassee up to April, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. The 2d Reserve Guard Division was relieved about April 7 of the\r\nCuinchy-Canal sector of La Bassee. After a rest in Belgium in the\r\nvicinity of Tournai, the division was placed in the Gommecourt sector\r\n(Somme), end of May.\r\n\r\n2. The Franco-British offensive found it in this sector July 1. It was\r\nseverely engaged from July to November, 1916, sometimes in the vicinity\r\nof Pozieres, Thiepval, Bazentin-le-Petit (from July to September),\r\nsometimes farther north, and suffered serious losses (51 per cent of its\r\npersonnel).\r\n\r\n3. The 2d Reserve Guard Division was maintained in the Gommecourt-\r\nHebuterne sector during the entire winter of 1916–17. At the end of 1916\r\nit ceded the 55th Reserve Infantry to the 220th Division (organization).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n1. The middle of March, 1917, the 2d Reserve Guard Division participated\r\nin the retreat of the German Army; it went back through Bucquoy,\r\nLagnicourt, Beaumetz-les-Cambrai toward the Hindenburg line. It\r\nestablished itself on this line between Queant and Boursies until the\r\nend of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of June the division remained at rest several days\r\nin the vicinity of Cambrai, and was then transported to the Thielt,\r\n(Pitthem-Eeghem) district (end of June). At the beginning of July it\r\napproached the front toward Staden.\r\n\r\n3. On July 31, certain elements of the division, being surprised and\r\nlater reassembled on the western border of the Houthulst forest, counter\r\nattacked in the direction of Bixschoote and suffered rather heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n4. The 2d Reserve Guard Division remained in this sector eight days. It\r\nwas relieved August 8–9 and sent to rest in the district of Gand\r\n(Lakeren-Ostnieuwekerke) till the beginning of September.\r\n\r\n5. About the 10th of September it was sent into the line on the front\r\nwest of Passchendaele (southeast of St. Julien). It was withdrawn from\r\nthis position toward the end of the month in order to go in again,\r\nalmost immediately, to the southeast of Armentieres.\r\n\r\n6. It remained there until the end of November, after which it\r\nreappeared on the front west and north of Passchendaele in December.\r\n\r\n7. It was relieved February 1, 1918, and went into the district of\r\nRoulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Reserve Guard Division was always considered as being an\r\nexcellent division because it had always fought well, though it showed\r\nonly mediocre fighting qualities to the north of Ypres in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe 31st of July it counterattacked without energy and without success\r\nin the direction of Bixschoote. During the approach, a great number of\r\nmen remained in the rear.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, its attitude was passive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Passchendaele sector until withdrawn\r\nabout January 9.\r\n\r\n2. It came back into line, relieving the 199th Division, during the\r\nnight of January 23–24, north of Passchendaele. It was relieved by the\r\n239th Division February 1.\r\n\r\n3. February 7 it relieved the 239th Division; relieved by 41st Division\r\nMarch 3. It then was trained for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n4. March 21 the division reinforced the Cambrai front near St. Leger,\r\nfighting, with heavy losses, until the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n5. It came back into line west of Neuville-Vitasse about April 3,\r\nrelieving the 236th Division. April 29 the division was relieved by the\r\nextension of the fronts of the neighboring divisions.\r\n\r\n6. It went to the Douai area and rested there until coming into line in\r\nthe Gavrelle sector during the night of June 7–8; it relieved the 187th\r\nDivision. It was relieved by the 187th Division June 20 and went to be\r\nreconstituted in the Tournai area, receiving a draft from the 427th\r\nInfantry Regiment and another of over 500 men from Germany.\r\n\r\n7. The division relieved the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, near\r\nBucquoy, August 7. During the heavy fighting that followed it lost 2,400\r\nin prisoners alone. It was withdrawn August 25.\r\n\r\n8. September 2 it reinforced the front near the Arras-Cambrai road,\r\nwhence it was withdrawn about the middle of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n9. It then relieved the 9th Reserve Division near Neuve-Chapelle\r\nSeptember 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n10. October 5 prisoners belonging to the division were identified near\r\nLedeghem. It remained there, being identified by prisoners November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe general commanding the 2d Guard Reserve Division was decorated in\r\nFebruary and again in May. The last decoration was Pour le Mérite, and\r\nwas accompanied by promotion. August 15 Gen. Petersdorff reprimanded the\r\ndivision because, as he said, “within 14 days, 1 noncommissioned officer\r\nand 10 other ranks have been missing from the division * * *.” It is\r\nconsidered as a second-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              2d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │3.       │4 Gren.  │3.       │4 Gren.  │3.       │4 Gren.\r\n              │         │44.      │         │44.      │         │33 Fus.\r\n              │4.       │33 Fus.  │4.       │33 Fus.  │         │44.\r\n              │         │45.      │         │45.      │         │3 Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │10 Horse Jag.

At the beginning of the war the 2d Division was sent to the Russian\r\nfront. Up to the month of November it participated in the operations in\r\nOriental Prussia (Tannenberg, Aug. 27–29).\r\n\r\n2. In November, 1914, the 2d Division, minus one brigade, which\r\ncontinued to hold its old sector, was withdrawn and included in the\r\ngroup which attacked in the direction of Lodz and operated between the\r\nVistula and the Warta; continuing its activities, it attempted to cross\r\nthe Bzura-Rawka opposite Warsaw in the district of Lowicz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1915, it reappeared in Oriental Prussia\r\nand participated in the offensive which ejected the Russians from this\r\nProvince. It was engaged in its entirety in the district of Lyck and\r\nmarched upon Augustowo and Grodno.\r\n\r\n2. The Russian counter attack launched in the vicinity of Prasnysz\r\ntoward the end of March drew the 2d Division to this sector.\r\n\r\n3. In July during the development of the Hindenburg offensive, it\r\nemerged from the Ostrolenka-Pultusk line and proceeded in a northerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n4. Upon the stabilization of the front the 2d Division held a sector\r\nbetween Illukst and Lake Drisviaty (Dwinsk District).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of July, 1916, portions of the 2d Division were assigned\r\nto duty in Galicia to oppose the Russian advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The reconstituted 2d Division was engaged in the Mitau sector up to\r\nthe end of January, 1917; all its units were identified in the vicinity\r\nof Kalnzen.\r\n\r\n2. On February 8 it entrained at Mitau for the western front.\r\n(Itinerary: Chavli, Kovno, Insterburg, Konigsberg, Stettin, Hamburg,\r\nMunster, Aix-la-Chapelle, Liège, Louvain, Bruxelles, Audenarde.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. Detrained February 13 and remained at rest up to the end of March. It\r\nreceived reinforcements of various classes of men (wounded,\r\nconvalescents, class 1917 reservists).\r\n\r\n4. The division occupied the Wytschaete sector from the 25th of March to\r\nthe beginning of June. (On April 15 and May 10 and 15 it received the\r\nfirst reinforcements from the class of 1918, the last having had only\r\nthree months’ instruction; in all, 4,460 men between January 1 and June\r\n1.) On June 7 it left 2,825 men in the hands of British troops.\r\n\r\n5. On June 10 the 2d Division retired from the Belgian front. It was\r\nplaced at rest in the district of Audenarde in June and then entrained\r\nfor the eastern front (end of June).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n6. It arrived in Russia at the beginning of July and was put at rest in\r\nthe district of Vilna. On July 14 it was identified in the Illukst\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n7. It returned to France on the 25th of November. It entrained on this\r\ndate at Kovno and was transported over the following itinerary:\r\nInsterburg, Thorn, Posen, Frankfort-sur-Oder, Berlin, Paderborn,\r\nCrefeld, Aix-la-Chapelle, Liège, Namur, Vouziers (Nov. 30).\r\n\r\n8. On December 27 it relieved the 1st Bavarian Division in the Souain-\r\nSomme-Py sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nExcept during the period March-June, 1917, when the 2d Division was\r\nfighting in Belgium, it continuously occupied the Russian front from the\r\nbeginning of the war till December, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 2d Division remained in line in the Souaine-Somme-Py region until\r\nrelieved by the 87th Division about April 2. It went back to the Army\r\ndepot at Semide, where it stayed about a week drilling and maneuvering.\r\nApril 10 it entrained at Machault, and went via Rethel, Liart, Marle,\r\nand detrained at La Ferté-Chevresis, encamping in the vicinity. It\r\ntraveled by St. Simon (Apr. 11), Ham, Solente (5 km. east of Roye), and\r\nLaboissiére, where it stayed until April 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. May 1 the division relieved the 51st Reserve Division at Monchel,\r\nsouth of Montdidier; relieved August 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n3. The division was identified in line near Essigny-le-Grand, south of\r\nSt. Quentin, September 5; it was relieved about the 15th by the\r\nextension of the fronts of the neighboring divisions.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of September 20–21 it went back into line north of\r\nSt. Quentin, in the Bellenglise sector. It was withdrawn about the 10th.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested for a fortnight in the Avesnes area, then came\r\ninto line October 24, relieving the 19th Reserve Division east of\r\nRibemont (southeast of St. Quentin). It was withdrawn from line early in\r\nNovember and did not return.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 2d is rated as a third-class division. It was used in a great deal\r\nof heavy fighting and suffered severe losses (July 23 it lost 54\r\nofficers and 1,800 men in prisoners alone west of the Avre; the 9th and\r\n10th of August it lost 443 prisoners; in its engagements between August\r\n8 and October 1 it lost over 1,500 prisoners). Nevertheless, it was\r\nnever used as an attacking division, but confined itself to holding the\r\nsectors allotted it; on account of its weakened condition and lowered\r\nmorale (there are several cases of insubordination on record), it did\r\nnot acquit itself any too well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         2d Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │53 Mixed │124 Ldw. │53 Mixed │124 Ldw. │53 Mixed │124 Ldw.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │\r\n              │         │125 Ldw. │         │125  Ldw.│         │125 Ldw.\r\n              │9 Bav.   │6 Bav.   │9 Bav.   │6 Bav.   │   (.)   │120 Ldw.\r\n              │  Mixed  │  Ldw.   │  Mixed  │  Ldw.   │         │\r\n              │Ldw.     │7 Bav.   │Ldw.     │7 Bav.   │         │122 Ldw.\r\n              │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │ 6 Res.

The 2d Landsturm Division (Franke Division) forms a part of the\r\nArgonne group and has continuously occupied sectors of this district\r\nsince September, 1914. At the beginning of the campaign it comprised a\r\nWurttemberg and a Bavarian brigade. Engaged at Etain August 24, 1914, it\r\ncrossed the Meuse at Stenay on the 31st.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning with September it occupied the line in the woods of Cheppy\r\nand Malancourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. Vauquois-bois de Malancourt sector.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September, 1915, portions of the division (one\r\nbattalion of the 6th and one of the 7th Bavarian Landsturm) were\r\nassigned to service in the district of Massiges; they rejoined the\r\nVauquois sector at the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. Vauquois-bois d’Avocourt and Malancourt sector.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of 1916 the 2d Landsturm Division was reconstituted\r\nwith exclusively Wurttemberg elements, including the 120th Landsturm,\r\nwithdrawn from the Bavarian Ersatz Division, and the 122d Landsturm,\r\nproceeding from the 1st Bavarian Landsturm Division. The 9th Bavarian\r\nbrigade went over to the 1st Bavarian Landsturm Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. In the Cheppy-bois d’Avocourt wood sector.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of August, 1917, the 2d Landsturm Division changed places\r\nwith the 2d Bavarian Division and took the Nord Four sector of Paris-\r\nBolante-Courte-Chausse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nSector division. Did not leave Argonne from the beginning of the war. On\r\nseveral occasions it furnished young men to active and reserve\r\nWurttemberg regiments, replacing them by older Landsturm men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\nThe division remained in line in the Apremont sector, engaging in but\r\nlittle activity until the American attack of September 26. From that\r\ntime on until it was withdrawn, October 25, it fought a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nMost of the young men of the division were taken from it to be sent to\r\nother organizations early in the year. October 12 the corps commander\r\ntelegraphed the King of Wurttemberg (the 2d Landwehr Division comes from\r\nWurttemberg): “The 2d Landwehr Division * * * has particularly\r\ndistinguished itself by its bravery and intrepidity during the last\r\ncombats in the Argonne and has thus contributed toward the failure of\r\nthe enemy’s attempt to break through.” It was badly used on the opening\r\nday of the American attack, but it fought hard. It loaned companies to\r\nvarious other divisions, including the 1st and 5th Guard Divisions, and\r\nfor days at a time these Landwehr troops were making the greatest\r\nresistance in the Aire Valley. While the division lost only 795\r\nprisoners during the offensive, its total losses undoubtedly are above\r\n5,000, there being evidence to show that many companies did not have\r\nmore than 25 men, there being only three companies per battalion, and—in\r\nat least one case—only two battalions in the regiment. It is rated as a\r\nfourth-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         2d Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │3 Bav.   │3 Bav.   │3 Bav.   │3 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │12 Bav.\r\n              │         │20 Bav.  │         │20 Bav.  │         │15 Bav.\r\n              │4 Bav.   │12 Bav.  │4 Bav.   │12 Bav.  │         │20 Bav.\r\n              │         │15 Bav.  │         │15 Bav.  │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Bav.

At the beginning of August the 2d Bavarian Division which, with the\r\n1st Bavarian Division, formed the 1st Bavarian Corps, was a part of the\r\narmy of the Crown Prince of Bavaria (6th Army). The 3d Brigade, covering\r\ntroops, detrained at Reding near Saarburg, the 3d of August. On the 9th\r\nthe division was at its full strength. It proceeded to the frontier,\r\nreached Badonviller, and retired as far as Gosselming (west of Saarburg)\r\nthe 17th of August, gave battle there on the 20th, and recrossed the\r\nfrontier. It advanced as far as Xaffévillers (Sept. 7), whence it\r\nretired to Morhange (Sept. 10). On September 15 the division entrained\r\nat Metz. It detrained near Namur, gained Peronne by stages, and was\r\nengaged at Foucaucourt the 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Together with the 1st Bavarian Corps it was attached to the 2d Army\r\n(Von Bülow), operating on the Somme in the district of Peronne. It took\r\npart in the fiercely contested battles which took place there but a\r\nshort time after the stabilization of the front and suffered serious\r\nlosses. At the beginning of the campaign, October 30, the 12th Infantry\r\nhad 50 officers and 1,910 men who were unable to take part in action\r\n(lists of losses).\r\n\r\n3. The division was maintained in this district up to the month of\r\nOctober, 1915, first to the south of the Somme, later, at the beginning\r\nof November, 1914, between Dompierre and Maricourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the division was reduced to three regiments through\r\nthe cession of the 3d Infantry to the 11th Bavarian Division. Between\r\nthe 10th and 15th of October, 1915, the 2d Bavarian Division was placed\r\non the Artois front in the Neuville-Souchez sector.\r\n\r\n2. About the 20th of December it was in the line at Bailleul-Sire-\r\nBerthoult between the western part of the Lille road and the Arras road.\r\n\r\n3. It remained there until the beginning of May, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. At this date it was relieved and transported to Verdun. It\r\nparticipated in the violent battles which took place there in May and\r\nJune in the vicinity of Douaumont and suffered serious losses (50 per\r\ncent of its personnel). It was reconstituted in June in the district of\r\nMerke-Romagne-sur-les-Cotes (reinforcement of from 50 to 100 men per\r\ncompany), and went back to the line near Thiaumont. It suffered serious\r\nlosses in the attack of June 23 (the companies of the 12th Bavarian\r\nRegiment were reduced to about 40 men).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. The 2d Bavarian Division was withdrawn from this zone of combat about\r\nthe 15th of July and was sent to the Apremont-St. Mihiel sector, where\r\nit was reconstituted. It received numerous reinforcements (convalescents\r\nand class 16 men). During this period, which extends up to October 15,\r\nit did not take part in any serious operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of October it was transported to the Somme (Sailly-\r\nSaillisel sector), where it was again put to a severe test.\r\n\r\n4. After staying a month in the Somme district it reoccupied the lines\r\nin the St. Mihiel sector at the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n1. The 2d Bavarian Division was withdrawn from the St. Mihiel sector\r\nbetween the 2d and 5th of May, 1917, and entrained at Mars-la-Tour on\r\nthe 6th, whence it was transported via Conflans to Montcornet, where,\r\nduring the night of the 8th, it gained the sector situated to the east\r\nof Hurtebise.\r\n\r\n2. From the 9th on the 2d Bavarian Division engaged some of its elements\r\non the salient northeast of Californie Plateau (May 9 and 10).\r\n\r\n3. The division occupied this sector up to the end of May and\r\nparticipated in serious engagements notably those of the 13th and 22d of\r\nMay to the northwest of the plateau. It was put to a very severe test.\r\n(The 9th Company of the 20th Battalion was reduced to 45 men.)\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n4. The 2d Bavarian Division was relieved at the beginning of June and\r\nsent to rest for 15 days at Camp Sissonne; later it was transported to\r\nthe Argonne, where it occupied the Grande Courte-Chausse sector. During\r\nthis rest it received two reinforcements—700 to 800 men June 28 and 300\r\nmen in July.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of August it changed sectors and went into the line toward\r\nBois d’Avocourt (Bois de Cheppy).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. The division was withdrawn from this sector at the end of October and\r\nremained in repose in the vicinity of Stenay up to the middle of\r\nNovember, whence it was directed to the sector west of the Bois-le-\r\nChaume. The 12th Bavarian Regiment, which had been sent in reserve to\r\nthe southeast of Altkirch about the 10th of November to ward off an\r\nexpected French attack in Alsace, rejoined the division December 6.\r\n\r\n7. The 2d Bavarian Division remained in this sector (southeast of\r\nBeaumont) up to January, 1918, and then went to rest in the district of\r\nLongwy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Bavarian Division participated on the 9th and 10th of May, 1917,\r\nin violent but unsuccessful counterattacks on the salient northeast of\r\nthe Californie Plateau. It appears that the Bavarians were always placed\r\nin the most dangerous positions and that they were sacrificed by the\r\nPrussians.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this condition the 2d Bavarian Division still showed itself\r\nas a good division (July, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line north of the Bois des Fosses until\r\nrelieved by the 19th Reserve Division, January 14. It went then to the\r\nLongwy region, where it was put through a stiff course of training in\r\nopen warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMIENS.\r\n\r\n2. March 23 it entrained at Audun-le-Roman, and traveled via Longwy-\r\nSedan-Charleville-Hirson-Anor-Avesnes-Le Cateau-Bertry-Caudry to\r\nCambrai, where it detrained March 24–25. At first the division marched\r\nin the direction of Bapaumes, but was diverted in a southerly direction\r\non the way and passed through Le Transloy-Sailly-Saillisel-Péronne-\r\nVillers-Carbonnel-Estrees-Foucaucourt and billeted at Beaucourt-en-\r\nSanterre on the night of March 30–31. April 2 it attacked at Morisel,\r\nand two days later to the southwest of Morisel. It fought then until the\r\n15th, when it side-slipped to the north, relieving the 54th Division,\r\nits place being taken by the 15th Division. It was relieved about May 4\r\nby the 21st Division.\r\n\r\n3. It moved to the area southeast of Ghent, and there was reconstituted\r\nand trained. June 2, it relieved the 14th Bavarian Division in the\r\nMorisel sector. It was relieved the middle of the month by the extension\r\nof fronts of the neighboring divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. It rested in rear of the front in Champagne for about a month and\r\nthen entered line in the Navarin sector (north of Souain), being\r\nidentified by prisoners, July 15. It was withdrawn on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE.\r\n\r\n5. August 4 the division relieved the 22d Division at Jonchery (on the\r\nVesle, east of Fismes). It remained in line, taking part in the general\r\nretirement, until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Bavarian is one of the very best German shock divisions. It was\r\ncalled upon to do a great deal of heavy fighting, and always acquitted\r\nitself well. It suffered severe losses in consequence, but these were\r\nmade good as long as the German High Command had replacements at its\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     2d Bavarian Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │9 Bav.

Two of its\r\nregiments, the 5th Bavarian Landwehr and the 10th Bavarian Landwehr,\r\nwere assigned respectively to the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Division and the\r\n33d Reserve Division, at that time on the Lorraine front. The 2d\r\nBavarian Landwehr was ceded by the 6th Bavarian Landwehr Division, which\r\nheld a Vosges sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. As soon as it was constituted the 2d Bavarian Landwehr Division was\r\ntransported to the Eastern front via Frankfort and Leipzig.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n2. Directed to Courlande and attached to the 8th Army it entered the\r\nline in the vicinity of Friedrichstadt (middle of January, 1917) and\r\nremained in this district up till February, 1918. In September it\r\nparticipated in the operations against Riga.

In August, 1914, the 3d Guard Division was first directed to the\r\nWestern Front. It fought below Namur.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. The 27th of August the division was transported to Silesia via\r\nOriental Prussia. It took part in the invasion of southern Poland.\r\n\r\n3. The group of armies of which it formed a part was turned back and was\r\nobliged to retire to Lodz.\r\n\r\n4. During the winter of 1914–15 it took part in the severe engagements\r\non the Bzura.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1915 the 3d Guard Division was dismembered; the\r\n5th Brigade was sent to Oriental Prussia; the 6th Brigade, to the south\r\nof the Carpathians, was engaged in the Uzsok defile distinct.\r\n\r\n2. In March, 1915, the 6th Brigade alone formed the 3d Guard Division,\r\nwith the addition of the 9th Grenadier Regiment to its own two\r\nregiments. Thus formed, the 3d Guard Division took part in the campaign\r\nof the summer of 1915. (Carpathians Oriental Galicia. Linsingen’s army.)\r\n\r\n3. The division took up its position before Tarnopol and passed the\r\nwinter of 1915–16 there. (Bothmer’s army.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1916, the 3d Guard Division was transported to the Western\r\nFront. It occupied a sector in Champagne and took part in no serious\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\n2. It was sent to rest at Valenciennes the 1st of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The 1st of July (beginning of the Franco-British offensive) the 3d\r\nGuard Division went into the line on the Somme. It was put to a severe\r\ntest there, particularly in the Thiepval district (57.5 per cent loss).\r\n\r\n4. After the Somme it was sent to the Dixmude front.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n5. It was transported to Galicia (beginning of September) by the\r\nfollowing itinerary: Liège, Cologne, Leipzig, Dresden, Cracow, Przemysl.\r\n\r\n6. At Halicz the 3d Guard Division took part in the German\r\ncounteroffensive, and again suffered great losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n7. It was sent back to the Western Front on the 24th of November by the\r\nfollowing itinerary: Lemberg, Jaroslaw, Gorlitz, Dresden, Chemnitz,\r\nNurnberg, Heilbronn, Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Rheinweiler, and having\r\narrived there the 20th of November, was sent to rest for a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Beginning with January and up to April 6, 1917, the division occupied\r\nthe sector of the forest of Parroy.\r\n\r\n2. The 8th of April it entrained at Metz, and arrived at Cambrai via\r\nMontmedy, Sedan, and Charleville.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. Engaged in action before Arras in order to repulse the English\r\noffensive from April 15 on, it participated in severe battles (May).\r\n\r\n4. On the 18th of May the division was relieved and sent into the\r\nCambrai district. After a short period of repose it occupied the\r\nPronville-Inchy-en-Artois sector (June 1–22).\r\n\r\n5. It was sent in reserve to the Bruges sector (June 22).\r\n\r\n6. It was transported to Thourout the 9th of July and remained there at\r\nrest until July 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n7. On the 31st of July, the date of the great British attack, the 3d\r\nGuard Division suffered very heavy losses (1,000 prisoners) in relieving\r\nthe 23d Reserve Division in the Pilken sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n8. It was relieved the 5th and 6th of August and transported to Alsace,\r\nwhere it was placed at rest. At the beginning of September it occupied\r\nthe Altkirch sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n9. About the 7th of October the division was again sent to Flanders to\r\nthe northeast of Zonnebecke.\r\n\r\n10. The 3d Guard Division left the Ypres front (Zonnebecke) at the\r\nbeginning of November, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n11. After remaining in the vicinity of Ghent it went into action before\r\nCambrai near the Bourlon wood (Nov. 22).\r\n\r\n12. It was relieved the 10th of December and went to rest in the\r\nVendegies District (south of Valenciennes—division maneuvers).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The division returned to the line in the sector, southwest of Cambrai\r\non January 10, relieving the 21st Reserve Division. It remained in line\r\nuntil the 119th Division relieved it on February 12.\r\n\r\n2. The division retired to Hem-Lenglet (north of Cambrai) where it\r\nrested and underwent instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n3. The division entered the line on March 19, between Inchy-en-Artois\r\nand Pronville. Engaged in the advance between the 21st and 24th. It\r\nsuffered heavy losses on the 22d in the fighting north of Beaumetz,\r\npassing to the second line on the 24th. The division came back and\r\nparticipated in the fighting about Bucquoy and Hebuterne, March 26-April\r\n3.\r\n\r\n4. Returning from the Somme front about April 4, the division was at\r\nrest until April 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n5. The division was engaged on the Lys, northeast of Estaires, after\r\nApril 18, then north of Kemmel from April 30 to May 5. Heavy losses\r\nfeatured the fighting.\r\n\r\n6. After resting at Halluin for seven days the division was moved by\r\nrail to Lorraine by the route Namur, Treves, Saarbruck, Sarreguemines.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n7. On May 18 the division relieved the 202d Division in the Chateau\r\nSalins sector. While in this quiet sector the division received\r\nreinforcements. When it left the line on June 24, the division was\r\ncomparatively fresh and an available reinforcement for a battle front.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n8. On leaving Lorraine the division moved to Rozay-sur-Lene, July 1, and\r\nlater southward to Hannogne.\r\n\r\n9. In the offensive of July 15, the division fought east of Rheims in\r\nthe region of des Monts. Between the 15th and 31st heavy losses were\r\nsuffered. It is known to have received a draft of 300 men in July.\r\n\r\n10. While at rest behind the Champagne front further drafts of men from\r\nRussia and Rumania were received.\r\n\r\n11. The division held the line in Champagne north of St. Hilaire-le-\r\nGrand from August 15 to September 18.\r\n\r\n12. Upon relief the division was first sent to Laon, but was hastily\r\nentrained and hurried to Machault, where it entered the line\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n13. From September 27 to October 5 the division was engaged between\r\nSomme-Py and Manre; then it fought near Orfeuil where 900 prisoners were\r\nlost. Acting as a rear guard, the division covered the retreat from\r\nMachault to Voziers. Extremely heavy losses were reported in this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n14. Withdrawn on the 8th, the division was moved by truck to Romagne.\r\nAfter two days in reserve it entered the line on the 12th, now opposing\r\nthe first American Army. In this sector it fought vigorously, making\r\nperhaps the stiffest resistance encountered in the offensive.\r\n\r\n15. The division went out on October 17 and rested until the 26th.\r\n\r\n16. Reengaged northeast of Attigny (Rilly-aux-Dies) on the 26th, the\r\ndivision continued in line until the armistice. The last identification\r\nwas southeast of Mezieres on November 7. Five hundred prisoners were\r\nlost by the division during their last period in line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Guard Division was rated as one of the best German divisions. It\r\nwas completely exhausted in the offensive of March and April and\r\nsuffered from a low morale in July and August. The Argonne Battle losses\r\nwere very severe for the division. The regiments were reduced to 200 and\r\n300 effectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              3d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │5.       │2 Gren.  │5.       │2 Gren.  │6.       │34 Fus.\r\n              │         │9 Gren.  │         │9 Gren.  │         │42.\r\n              │6.       │34 Fus.  │6.       │34 Fus.  │         │4 Ldw.\r\n              │         │42.      │         │42.      │   (1, 2, and 4\r\n              │         │         │         │         │      Btns.).\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼───────────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Horse Gren.

Was situated to the north of Soissons after the retreat. The 2d of\r\nOctober it was in the district south of Roye; on the 4th it fought near\r\nBeauvraignes.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of November it was transported to Flanders\r\n(Wytschaete-Messines District) where it remained till the end of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n7. It then entrained for Russia (end of November). On its arrival it was\r\ndivided. The 5th Brigade was attached to the 8th Army in Oriental\r\nPrussia, the 6th Brigade to the 10th Army to the east of Lodz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. During the first months of 1915 the two brigades remained separated\r\nand changed position with their respective armies. The 5th Brigade went\r\ninto the government of Souvalki near the frontier of Oriental Prussia;\r\nthe 6th into Poland near Prasnysz and the Narew.\r\n\r\n2. In May, at the time of the formation of new divisions, the 5th\r\nBrigade was broken up. The 2d Grenadiers, then in Courland, went over to\r\nthe Homeyer Brigade which then became the 109th Division; the 9th\r\nGrenadiers went as the Third Regiment to the 3d Guard Division which\r\nabandoned one of its brigades (the 5th Guard) for the formation of a 4th\r\nGuard Division.\r\n\r\n3. The 3d Division, reduced to the 6th Brigade, completed itself by the\r\naddition of the 4th Landwehr Regiment (1st, 2d, and 4th Battalions). The\r\nprogress of the Russian offensive conducted it into the Vidzy District,\r\nwhere it firmly established itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Its composition varied still more in the course of the year 1916 and\r\nit lost the two active regiments which it still had. The 42d Infantry\r\nleft it in September to go to the Kovel District and from there to\r\nMacedonia; in December the 34th Fusiliers left it definitely in order to\r\ngo to Courland. In exchange it received two regiments formed in the\r\nautumn, the 426th and the 428th Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. There was no change of composition or position during 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\nThe division remained in the east throughout the year. Its movements\r\nwere obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         3d Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │18 Ldw.  │6 Ldw.   │18 Ldw.  │6 Ldw.   │18 Ldw.  │6 Ldw.\r\n              │         │7 Ldw.   │         │7 Ldw.   │         │7 Ldw.\r\n              │19 Ldw.  │37 Ldw.  │         │19 Ldw.  │37 Ldw.  │19 Ldw.\r\n              │         │46 Ldw.  │         │46 Ldw.  │         │46 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Ldw.

Up to the German offensive of the summer of 1915 the 3d Landwehr\r\nDivision, along with the 2d Landwehr Corps, participated in the Polish\r\ncampaign. At the end of October, 1914, it was identified before Warsaw\r\n(Rawa-Vistula); in the middle of November it was in retreat to the south\r\nand east of Czenstochow; in December it was to the west of Kielce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1915, the 2d Landwehr Corps was still in the Kielce\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the middle of February a brigade (19th Landwehr Brigade) was\r\ndetached to the northeast of Warsaw (Plock-Mlawa). Reassembled to the\r\nwest of Kielce in April, the 3d Landwehr Division remained between the\r\nVistula and the Pilica until July.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARANOVITCHI.\r\n\r\n3. The division took part in the offensive against the Russians (July-\r\nAugust); it was before Ivangorod July 20 and arrived in the vicinity of\r\nBaranovitchi toward the end of August.\r\n\r\n4. In October it was in the line near Goroditche. In November it took\r\nthe Liakhovitchi sector (south of Baranovitchi).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 3d Landwehr Division remained to the southeast of Baranovitchi\r\n(Liakhovitchi) for more than two years (November, 1915-January, 1918).\r\nThe 37th Landwehr became independent in July, 1916, and received various\r\nsuccessive additions. About the same date the 3d Landwehr Division\r\nfurnished a part of the elements necessary to the formation of the 420th\r\nInfantry. In return the 327th Landwehr was assigned to it, and it kept\r\nthis regiment until June, 1917, ceding it at that time to the 4th\r\nLandwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Liakhovitchi sector. In November the 3d Landwehr Division sent an\r\nimportant reinforcement to the 9th Division (particularly to the 7th\r\nGrenadiers); two months later a smaller reinforcement was sent to the\r\n43d Reserve Division, which was preparing to leave the eastern front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\nThe division remained in the eastern theatre throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division remained on the Russian front from the beginning of the\r\nwar.

At the time of the declaration of war the 3d Bavarian Division and\r\nthe 4th Bavarian Division constituted the 2d Bavarian Army Corps. At the\r\nbeginning of August, 1914, the 2d Bavarian Army Corps formed a part of\r\nthe 6th Army (Crown Prince of Bavaria). It detrained at Faulquemont\r\n(Lorraine) on August 8, and the 3d Bavarian Division was to the north of\r\nChâteau-Salins on the 10th. It took part in the Battle of Morhange on\r\nthe 20th, passed the frontier, pillaged Gerbeviller on its way, and\r\nadvanced as far as the left bank of the Mortagne. Forced to turn back,\r\nit moved near Metz the 15th of September and entrained the 19th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME-FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to the 1st Bavarian Army Corps, the 2d Bavarian Army Corps\r\nwas attached to the 2d Army and fought in the Peronne District (end of\r\nSeptember); then it was transported to Flanders, where it rejoined the\r\n6th Army.\r\n\r\n3. From November, 1914, to October, 1915, the 2d Bavarian Army Corps\r\noccupied the front from the Ypres-Comines Canal as far as Douve. During\r\nthis period it generally remained on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the 3d Bavarian Division ceded the 22d Infantry to\r\nthe 11th Bavarian Division, formed at this time.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1915, the 3d Bavarian Division was sent as a reinforcement for\r\na short time to the Arras sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. In the month of October the 2d Bavarian Army Corps (3d and 4th\r\nBavarian Divisions) was transported to the Auchy-Loos sector and kept\r\nthere until August, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In the Loos sector the 2d Bavarian Army Corps showed itself very\r\nactive. It undertook mine works and executed them with great rapidity.\r\nAt the end of April it attempted a gas attack; this latter had no\r\nsuccess, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The 3d Bavarian Division left the Loos sector with its Army Corps\r\nabout August 25 and went into the Somme District. It occupied the\r\nMartinpuich-Bazentin-le-Petit sector up to the 15th of September and\r\nfought with characteristic stubbornness. Its total losses during this\r\nperiod reached 4,976 men (55 per cent).\r\n\r\n3. The Division retired from the Somme September 27 and was sent to the\r\nDouve sector (from this river to the Armentières-Lille railroad). It\r\nremained there till the end of March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The 3d Bavarian Division was relieved from Armentieres March 20,\r\n1917. It was transported to the Arras District, situated on the Scarpe\r\nfront, on April 11. It suffered considerable loss in the two unfortunate\r\ncounterattacks of Monchy-le-Preux and in the French counterattack of\r\nApril 23.\r\n\r\n2. The division was withdrawn from the front April 25 and sent to rest\r\nin the Roubaix zone until the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. On June 5 the 3d Bavarian Division began to relieve the 40th Division\r\nin the Messines sector. The British attack took place on the 7th during\r\nthis relief. The division lost the village and the summit of Messines.\r\nIt suffered considerable loss and left 1,531 prisoners in the hands of\r\nthe enemy. (The 17th Battalion was reduced to 800 men; the 23d suffered\r\nabout equal losses; the 18th lost fewer men.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. The 3d Bavarian Division was withdrawn from the Messines sector June\r\n8, 1917, and taken to the Conflans area. After a short period of repose,\r\nduring which it was partially reconstituted, it was put into the line in\r\nthe sector of the Bezange forest (south of Château-Salins) July 18.\r\n\r\n5. The 3d Bavarian Division received a reinforcement of 4,500\r\nmen—convalescents, exclusively—between June 8 and the end of August. (At\r\nthe end of August the personnel averaged only 120 men who drew rations\r\n(80 combatants) per company in the 17th Battalion.) The losses sustained\r\nthe 7th of June had not been made good by the 28th of August.\r\n\r\n6. The division was sent into Lorraine for rest and reconstitution,\r\nremaining on the defensive, and pursuing the instruction of its\r\ndetachments in the use of light minenwerfers and assault tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n7. It left Lorraine in the middle of October. On the 28th it occupied\r\nthe Aisne front to the north of Braye-en-Laonnois (Trucy sector). The\r\n17th Battalion was the only one to engage in the October battles which\r\npreceded the German retreat to the north of the Ailette.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Bavarian Division is one of the best German units.\r\n\r\nIt always fought well, showing great energy in the offensive and\r\npreserving a great tenacity in the defensive.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fighting value of this division appears to have\r\ndiminished during the course of the year 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. About January 1 the division was relieved and went into training in\r\nthe region Fournes-Chimay, where it remained for four weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n2. The division relieved the 47th Reserve Division near Septvaux about\r\nFebruary 1, and occupied the line until March 28.\r\n\r\n3. Retired from the front on the 28th; the division was sent toward\r\nChauny-La Fere, where it constituted the reserve division of the 8th\r\nReserve Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n4. In April the division alternated between short periods in line and\r\nbrief rests. North of Plemont it relieved the 7th Reserve Division about\r\nApril 2, was relieved by the 1st Bavarian Division a few days later, and\r\nreturned to line about April 11, relieving the 1st Bavarian Division.\r\nAbout this time the division received a draft of 900 men of the 1919\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n5. The division was withdrawn from the Lassigny front about May 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE OISE.\r\n\r\n6. The division participated in the Oise fighting of June, although it\r\ndid not take a direct part in the opening attack. It supported the\r\neffort of the 3d Bavarian Reserve Division, lending some battalions,\r\nfrom which prisoners were taken. About the middle of June the division\r\npassed to the second line, rested two weeks, and returned to the\r\nMontdidier-Noyon front about June 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n7. The division remained in line throughout July and encountered the\r\nAllied attack of middle August. About August 21 it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n8. Between August 21 and October 7 the division was not satisfactorily\r\nidentified. Elements were reported near Terguier in September, near\r\nYpres, and in the region of St. Etienne-Arnes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n9. The division entered the Woevre line on October 7, near Manheulles,\r\nwhere it remained until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was used during 1918 as a sector-holding division. It took\r\nno prominent part in the offensives of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          3d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │5 Res.   │2 Res.   │5 Res.   │2 Res.   │5 Res.   │2 Res.\r\n              │         │9 Res.   │         │9 Res.   │         │9 Res.\r\n              │6 Res.   │34 Res.  │6 Res.   │34 Res.  │6 Res.   │20\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Landst.\r\n              │         │49 Res.  │         │49 Res.  │         │49 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │5 Res.

At the beginning of the war the 3d Reserve Division, recruited in the\r\n2d District (Pomerania), formed a part of the 8th German Army\r\n(Hindenburg). It fought with this army in eastern Prussia; it was\r\nengaged in the battle of Tannenberg (Aug. 26–28), in the battles of\r\nBiallo, Lyck, Suwalki, and Augustowo (September-October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1915, the 3d Reserve Division participated in the battle\r\nof the Mazurian Lakes, and in May in the battles on the Polish frontier.\r\n\r\n2. During the great offensive of the summer of 1915 the division was\r\nengaged in the operations on the Bobr, which resulted in the taking of\r\nOssovietz. In August it fought in the vicinity of Kovno. It participated\r\nin the siege of this city (Aug. 13–18) at the battle of Niemen (Aug. 19-\r\nSept. 8). When the front was stabilized it took position to the north of\r\nSmorgoni (southeast of Vilna).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 3d Reserve Division occupied this sector (north of Smorgoni) up\r\nto March, 1917. At this time it was placed in reserve in the Vilna\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of May, 1917, it was sent to the western front. It\r\nentrained May 13 at Soly (east of Vilna), and was transported via Vilna,\r\nWirballen, Gumbinnen, Berlin, Hanover, Aix-la-Chapelle, Liege, Louvain,\r\nand Brussels up to Bruges, where it detrained May 18. It was sent to\r\nrest in this district until June 4.\r\n\r\n3. On this date the division was transported to the district north of\r\nSt. Quentin and went into the line on the 8th in the Vendhuille-\r\nBellicourt sector (west of Catelet), where it habituated itself to the\r\nwestern front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n4. The division was relieved the end of July. After having been in\r\nreserve for several days it engaged in the battle of Ypres on the\r\nFrezenberg front on August 4; here it was severely tried by artillery\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n5. It was withdrawn from the front August 18 and sent to rest, first at\r\nTournai and later in the Moorslede District.\r\n\r\n6. On September 23 it was again sent into the line in the battle of\r\nFlanders to the south of Zonnebeke (Polygone wood), and again suffered\r\nserious losses on the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n7. The 3d Reserve Division was relieved September 28 and transported to\r\nAlsace (Mulhouse District), where it remained in repose up to the middle\r\nof October.\r\n\r\n8. About the 10th or 15th of October it occupied the sector north of the\r\ncanal from the Rhone to the Rhine, and remained there till the end of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n9. At this time it was withdrawn from the front. It entrained for Metz\r\nNovember 10. In December it was in the vicinity of Sissone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n10. About December 13 it entered the line in the Craonne sector\r\n(Juvincourt area). At the beginning of January it took over the\r\nneighboring sector (Bouconville).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nVery mediocre morale. The 49th Reserve Regiment was very severely tested\r\nby losses and desertions to such a point that it had to be returned to\r\nthe rear after August 18, 1917. September 26 the 8th Company of the same\r\nregiment refused to take part in the attack. The relatively high\r\nproportion of men of the 2d Landsturm levy may be responsible for these\r\nfacts, since they formed part of the regiments of the Second District.\r\n\r\nAccording to prisoners captured in February, 1918, the 3d Reserve\r\nDivision seemed to be of mediocre quality: “6,000 men lost in Flanders,\r\npoorly replaced by men 50 per cent of whom were old, many being above\r\n40, and by 30 per cent Poles.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite the mediocrity of its personnel, it must be noted\r\nthat the 49th Reserve was subjected to a special training for attack\r\ntroops in November and December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the line in the Craonne sector until about April\r\n20, when it was relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n2. It reappeared on May 1 near Hainvillers (southeast of Montdidier),\r\nwhere it remained until about June 20. The division was in the thick of\r\nthe June fighting on the Oise and lost heavily.\r\n\r\n3. About June 20 the division went to rest in the region of Guise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division participated in the fighting between the Marne and\r\nSoissons when the Allies delivered their attack on the Marne salient. It\r\nrelieved the 115th Division at Longpont on July 18 and withstood the\r\nattack until July 31. The 49th Reserve Regiment was almost annihilated\r\nin the course of the fighting near Mery. The other regiments were\r\nreduced to 70–80 rifles per company.\r\n\r\n5. Retired from the front on July 31, the division rested at La Capelle\r\nuntil September 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. The division came into line east of Chevisy on September 2. Its\r\ncomposition had been altered by the disbandment of the 2d Reserve\r\nRegiment and the addition of the 2d Grenadier Regiment from the 109th\r\nDivision. The British attack on the Somme of September 12 engulfed the\r\ndivision, which lost 1,300 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n7. It was withdrawn about September 27 and transferred to Belgium, where\r\nit entered the line near Dixmude on September 29. It held the line in\r\nthis sector until October 16, when it passed into the second line for a\r\nweek’s rest. Returning to line on the 23d, it remained in line until the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is rated as a third-class division. Its morale was on the\r\nwhole bad. The Polish elements deserted freely. In July pillaging of\r\nsupply trains was apparently prevalent in the divisional area. Elements\r\nof the division refused to fight in the Oise battle in June, and the\r\nGerman command appeared to have confidence in its fighting value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           3d Naval Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry     │4 Nav.       │1 Mar.       │Mar.         │1 Mar.\r\n              │             │2 Mar.       │Inf.

The 3d Naval Division was organized in April, 1917. Its Regiments\r\n(1st, 2d, and 3d Naval Infantry) were detached from the Naval Corps,\r\nbefore the constitution of the division, to take part in the attacks\r\nupon Steenstraat on April 22, 1915, and on the Somme from September,\r\n1916, to April, 1917. Since its formation the 3d Naval Division has\r\nscarcely left the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. In August, 1917, the 3d Naval Division occupied the sector of\r\nLombartzyde.\r\n\r\n3. In October it was in action on the Ypres front at Poelcappelle.\r\n\r\n4. In December it again took over the sector of Lombartzyde.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Naval Division is recruited from the entire German Empire, the\r\nnaval troops being imperial troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the troops of the 3d Naval Division were landing and\r\noccupying troops for the German colonies. They are good units whose\r\nrecruiting has been kept up to a high standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved north of St. Georges about the 1st of March\r\nand moved to Valenciennes, where it arrived about the 13th. From March\r\n18 to 23 it moved up to the front by stages via Haussy-Cattenieres-\r\nLesdain. On the 23d it followed up the advance, passing through Fins and\r\nManancourt on the 24th–25th and coming into action at Contalmaison on\r\nthe 25th. It captured Albert on the 26th. The division held a sector\r\nwest of Albert until mid-April, and on April 24 returned to its former\r\nsector west of Anthuille. It was relieved about the end of May by the\r\n24th Division.\r\n\r\n2. On June 20 the division returned to relieve the 24th Division in the\r\nAveluy sector. In mid-July the company strength was low. No drafts had\r\nbeen received recently and sickness was prevalent. This, together with\r\nthe August spell in line, had considerably reduced the morale of the\r\ndivision. It was relieved on August 19 by the 83d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested at Flers for five days, when it came into line\r\nwest of Grevillers on the night of August 23–24 to reinforce the line.\r\nIt was withdrawn in a few days (Aug. 26) and rested at Cambrai. Five\r\nhundred prisoners were taken from the division in this period.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested at Thourout during the first half of September.\r\nOn the 27th it was engaged west of Marcoing and fought in that area\r\nuntil the end of the month. The total prisoners captured from the\r\ndivision was 700.\r\n\r\n5. After two weeks’ rest in the Cambrai area, the division returned to\r\nline at Molain on October 17.

From March 14 to July 12 the 4th Guard Division was in line near\r\nPrzasnysz. It belonged to Gallwitz’s army, which was operating north of\r\nthe Vistula.\r\n\r\n2. From July 13 to September 28 the division took part in many fights,\r\nnotably on the Narew, and took part in the pursuit as far as the region\r\nof the marshes of Lithuania.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the front and reached Kovno on foot, where it\r\nentrained for the Western Front on October 10 via Koenigsberg, Luebeck,\r\nHamburg, Aix-la-Chapelle, Namur. Detrained at Douai and sent to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. From November 14 to 26 it occupied a sector near Arras, then went to\r\nrest near Cambrai.\r\n\r\n5. From December 15, 1915, to January 4, 1916, it built entrenchments in\r\nthe region of Wytschaete-Messines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. During January and February, 1916, the 4th Guard Division continued\r\nits entrenching work in the sector Wytschaete-Messines and held the\r\nsector at the same time.\r\n\r\n2. Until the end of April, 1917, the 4th Guard Division, together with\r\nthe 1st Reserve Guard Division, formed the reserve corps of the guard.\r\nBoth these divisions were put through a course of training with a view\r\nto active operations.\r\n\r\n3. From May 9 to July 23 the division remained in line northeast of\r\nNeuville-St. Vaast.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Engaged in the battle of the Somme July 25 (Estres sector), suffered\r\nheavy losses and was withdrawn August 19. Engaged again after a few days\r\nof rest and fought some severe local battles until September 10\r\n(Thiepval sector).\r\n\r\n5. After seven days of rest behind the Flanders front it held a quiet\r\nsector north of Ypres from September 17 to October 25.\r\n\r\n6. From November 6 to 25 it was again sent to the Somme, where it was\r\nsubjected to several heavy local attacks (Warlencourt sector).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Remained in the Warlencourt sector until March 17, 1917. It was\r\nrelieved immediately after it had retired to the Hindenburg line.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n2. After three weeks’ rest in the region of Tournai it was sent by\r\nstages to the south of Lens, where it went back in the lines. It\r\nsuffered considerable losses there. Withdrawn from the front July 11.\r\n\r\n3. At rest in the region of Pont-a-Vendin and Meurchin. On August 15 the\r\ndivision was hurried up to the north of Lens. It attacked to regain the\r\nlost ground but in vain. Its losses were extremely heavy.\r\n\r\n4. The division stayed in line until September 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. At rest for a week behind the front. Entrained September 23 and 24 at\r\nCarvin for Flanders.\r\n\r\n6. It was at first in the reserve of the army, but went into line\r\nSeptember 27 east of Zonnebeke. After one of its regiments had attacked\r\nand was stopped by the British artillery fire (Oct. 22), the division\r\nobtained replacements and on October 4 renewed its attempt to retake the\r\nheights lost on September 26. Warned by a British attack, they became\r\ndemoralized and fled in disorder toward Becelaere. The losses of the 4th\r\nGuard Division were so heavy that it had to be relieved on October 5 to\r\n7.\r\n\r\n7. Entrained for Guise and arrived there October 10. Went into line on\r\nthe 14th in the sector of Itancourt, southeast of St. Quentin, and was\r\nstill holding it in December. Its forces were much reduced by the\r\nattacks in Flanders and were reinforced by neighboring units (13th\r\nLandwehr Division).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nFormerly an excellent combat unit, having that traditional esprit de\r\ncorps which animated the regiments of the Prussian Guards. At the\r\npresent time (November, 1917) it has lost a good part of its fighting\r\nvalue. It seems to have been much weakened by the battle of Ypres\r\n(October, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUISE.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested during January near d’Origny Ste. Benoite (west\r\nof Guise).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. On February 4 the division came into line northwest of Bellenglise.\r\nIt was relieved about the middle of February.\r\n\r\n3. Upon relief, it marched via Bohain to St. Souplet, near Le Cateau.\r\nHere the division underwent a course of training in this area until\r\nMarch 18, when it marched via Bohain-Brancourt-Montbrehain-Ramicourt\r\nback to its old sector at Bellenglise, arriving in line March 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n4. The division attacked in the first line and advanced by Hesbecourt\r\nMarch 21–26. Passing into support for eight days it was reengaged April\r\n3–8 near Bouzencourt and le Hamel, suffering very heavy losses. Between\r\nthe 8th and the 24th the division rested. It was in line again near\r\nMarcelcave from the 22d to the end of April, participating in the attack\r\nat Villers-Bretoneaux on the 24th. Heavy losses were again sustained.\r\n\r\n5. Again the division went to rest at St. Souplet, near le Cateau. The\r\n2d Battalion of the 427th Regiment, dissolved, arrived as a\r\nreinforcement for the division on May 27. The division was moved by rail\r\nto Flavy le Martel on night of June 1. It marched by nights to Canny sur\r\nMatz (by Golancourt, Guiscard, and Candor) and entered the line on the\r\nnight of June 8–9.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE OISE.\r\n\r\n6. The division attacked on the 9th between Roye sur Matz and Canny sur\r\nMatz. It penetrated by Marquelise to Antheuil. The French counterattack\r\nthrew it back north of Antheuil on the 11th. The division stayed in line\r\nuntil the 19th.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n7. After resting at Bohain until June 29 the division was moved to\r\nLorraine by Valenciennes-Brussels-Namur-Saarburg. Here it was rested and\r\nreconstituted.\r\n\r\n8. The division returned by rail to Athies sur Laon on July 22. From\r\nthere it marched to Mousey sur Aisne by stages and then in trucks to\r\nMareuil en Dole on July 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE, VESLE, AISNE.\r\n\r\n9. The division was engaged July 27 southeast of Fere en Tardenois. It\r\nfell back toward Fismes on August 1–2, from where it was shifted into\r\nthe Courlandon-Breuil sector, which it held from August 14 to the\r\nbeginning of September. On the 5th it moved to the south of Glennes,\r\nremaining there until the 30th, when it fell back across the canal. The\r\ndivision was relieved on October 2, but turned back to line on the 5th\r\nto cover the retreat near Benu au Bac. On the 7th it went to rest for a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\r\nARDENNES.\r\n\r\n10. Reengaged west of Chateau Porcien from October 14 to November 5. The\r\n93d Regiment was mentioned in the German communique of November 2 as\r\nfighting especially well. In the retreat the division passed through\r\nRenneville and Rubigny, where it was last identified on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was always regarded as a first-class fighting division,\r\nalthough the losses on the Somme in March and the setback on the Oise in\r\nJune lowered its value. Constant fighting impaired the morale and kept\r\nthe effectives low, but the division was always to be included in the\r\nfirst-class divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             4th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │7.       │14.      │7.       │14.      │7.       │14.\r\n              │         │149.     │         │149.     │         │149.\r\n              │8.       │49.      │8.       │49.      │8.       │49.\r\n              │         │140.     │         │140.     │         │140.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │12 Drag.

At the beginning of the campaign the 4th Division fought on the\r\nWestern Front until November, 1914. It detrained at Rheydt on August 9\r\nand 10, and entered Belgium on the 14th and France on the 25th. Fought\r\nat Sailly-Saillisel on the 28th; reached Grand-Morin September 5 and\r\nfought at Acy en Multien on the 6th. After retreating to the north of\r\nSoissons it remained south of Roye from the end of September to the end\r\nof October, and was near Ypres in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to Russia and took part in the second offensive on Warsaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In January it took part in the battles of Bolimow. In February it\r\nwent to the Carpathians (Army of the South under Linsingen). Took part\r\nin the offensive on Lemburg.\r\n\r\n2. About September 27, 1915, it was relieved in the region south of\r\nBaranovitchi and entrained at Kobryn for the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. It arrived in the vicinity of Sedan at the beginning of October.\r\nAfter a few days’ rest it marched to the north of Tahure.\r\n\r\n4. On October 30 the division took part in the attack of Butte De Tahure\r\nand suffered severe losses.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of November it left Champagne for the region of\r\nReims where its units went into the trenches on November 8. Until the\r\nbeginning of April, 1916, it held the sector northwest of Prunay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of April the division was sent to rest in the\r\nvicinity of Rethel. During this period (Nov. 15 to Apr. 16) its losses\r\nwere light.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of May the division was sent to the region of\r\nVerdun. On May 4 it took part on the attack on Hill 304, where it\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved May 15 and sent to rest in the region of Mouzon-Carignan,\r\nfrom where it went to the region of Damvillers.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of July it was sent to hold the sector of Thiaumont\r\nat the moment when the French recommenced their offensive in that\r\nregion. Its losses were very heavy.\r\n\r\n5. On August 3 it left Thiaumont for the region of Cumieres, on the left\r\nbank of the Meuse (Aug. 5).\r\n\r\n6. At the end of September it held the sector Malancourt-Avocourt.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved at the end of October and trained at Dun. After a short rest\r\nit went into line in December northeast of Vaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Vaux sector until April 17.\r\n\r\n2. It relieved the 10th Reserve Division in the region of Satigneul\r\n(night of Apr. 15–16) a few hours before the beginning of our attack. It\r\nremained in this sector until May 5 and was subjected to French attacks\r\nof April 16 and May 4.\r\n\r\n3. Beginning May 5, it was relieved and went into camp in the region of\r\nCaurel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. On May 7 and the following days it went into the sector of Grille\r\nMont Haut and held this until June 19.\r\n\r\n5. The division was put in reserve on this date in the region Epove-\r\nWarmeriville.\r\n\r\n6. Went into line in the sector Moronvilliers (July 19 and days\r\nfollowing) until the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of October it entrained at Juniville and went to Belgium,\r\nwhere it held the sector Poelcapelle until November 24.\r\n\r\n8. It went into line again east of Armentieres on November 30 and was\r\nstill in that sector on January 11, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nIn spite of heavy losses suffered several times, it would seem that they\r\nwished to keep up the Pomeranian character of the 4th Division, although\r\nit received in September, 1915, some men of the 1915 class from Hesse-\r\nNassau, and later on a number of Brandenburgers and Silesians, as the\r\nthird and sixth districts often furnished their ratio to the districts\r\ntemporarily out of men. A great majority of men, however, came from\r\nPomerania, and as the resources of this Province in men are limited it\r\nwas necessary, to keep up the provincial composition of this division,\r\nto draw from the Landwehr depots and the battalions of Pomeranian\r\nLandsturm. Since it was impossible to maintain the quality of the\r\ndivision, it seems that they were anxious to maintain its nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Division was always a very good division and gave proof of very\r\nfine military qualities in all the battles in which it took part,\r\nespecially in the sector of Sapigneul during the offensives of April 16\r\nand May 4, 1917. It would seem that the nature of the replacements they\r\nreceived, especially the most recent ones, has considerably altered the\r\nvalue of this division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved from the front of Armentieres on January\r\n23, and went to rest and instruction in the Oisene area (southwest of\r\nDeyuze). After four weeks the division entrained at Roubaix on March 16\r\nand detrained at Douai on the following day. Hence it marched by stages\r\nto Neuville St. Remy, a suburb of Cambrai. The division was concentrated\r\nsouth of Inchy on the night of March 20–21.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. Engaged on March 21, the division advanced by Doignies and Herrnies.\r\nIt passed to rest on the 24th and was reengaged from March 26 to April 6\r\nat Miraumont, Hebuterne, and Colincamps. The division suffered very\r\nheavy losses in the engagement.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved from the Hebuterne front on April 6, the division rested two\r\nweeks in the Bapaune-Cambrai area. The division moved north to the Lys\r\nfront via Douai-Lille.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n4. The division was in line west of Merville from April 23 to May 14.\r\n\r\n5. While at rest north of Tournai, the division was reconstituted and\r\nprepared for another heavy engagement.\r\n\r\n6. The division entrained for Loos on June 30 and moved on to Sailly sur\r\nla Lys on July 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYS WITHDRAWAL.\r\n\r\n7. The division came into line near Merris on July 27. It lost 500\r\nprisoners south of Meteren on August 18. On the 30th the division fell\r\nback on Bailleul and later to Bac St. Maur and Fleurbaix. It was\r\nrelieved at Fleurbaix on October 11.\r\n\r\n8. The division rested from the 11th to the 21st near Denain.\r\n\r\n9. Again the division was engaged to the east and northeast of Solesmes\r\nand near Le Quesnoy, retreating to Beaurain, Ghissignies, and Ruesnes.\r\nIt passed in the second line on November 1, but came back to the line\r\nsouth of Le Quesnoy about November 5. It retreated by Locquignol toward\r\nMaubeuge, where it was last identified on November 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Division was a very good division. In 1918 its morale was\r\nmediocre, due to the young recruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          4th Ersatz Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │9 Ers.   │9, 10,   │9 Ers.   │9, 10,   │9 Mixed  │359.\r\n              │         │  11, and│         │  11, and│  Ers.   │\r\n              │         │  12,    │         │  12,    │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │360.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │13 Mixed │361.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │  Ers.   │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │362.\r\n              │13 Ers.  │13, 14,  │13 Ers.  │13, 14,  │         │\r\n              │         │  15, and│         │  15, and│         │\r\n              │         │  16,    │         │  16,    │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n              │33 Ers.  │33, 34,  │33 Ers.  │33, 34,  │         │\r\n              │         │  35, 36,│         │  35, and│         │\r\n              │         │  and 81,│         │  81,    │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │Ers.

From there it went to Bruges (Oct. 14), then Ostend (Oct. 16). On the\r\n17th by the road along the coast it marched from Ostend to Nieuport\r\n(Oct. 30). It then went into the line in front of the Belgians on the\r\nright bank of the Yser (November).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIXMUDE.\r\n\r\n1.

With the 37th Landwehr\r\nBrigade and the 2d Reserve Ersatz Brigade (Basedow Division) it\r\nconstituted the Werder Corps (December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division was kept in the region of Dixmude until April, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. After April a part of the division was sent east of Ypres between the\r\nYpres-Roulers Railway and the Comines Canal. Some of the units of the\r\ndivision remained in line near Dixmude.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. About September 27 the division left Belgium for the Somme, where it\r\nwas engaged during the first two weeks of October near Le Sars.\r\n\r\n4. On October 15 it returned to Belgium and went back to the sector east\r\nof Ypres in November.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to rest about November 30 and sent back to the Somme south of\r\nBapaume, about the middle of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Remained south of Bapaume (Le Transloy-Gueudecourt) until the end of\r\nFebruary, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of March it relieved the 14th Bavarian Division in\r\nthe same sector at the beginning of the retirement of the German troops,\r\nwithdrew to the east of Bertincourt, via Neuville-Bourjonval, Metz en\r\nCourtuere, and fought on the Trescault-Havricourt line (April).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about April 26 or 28 and sent north of the Scarpe about May\r\n10. Engaged near Roeux until about May 18 and suffered heavy losses\r\n(more than 800 prisoners).\r\n\r\n4.

Took part in the\r\noffensive against the Russians, and in September was near Radautz, where\r\nit remained until December. Due to some of its forces being transferred\r\nto other organizations more than to its losses, the companies of the\r\n362d Infantry from August to October, had fallen from 120 men to 70\r\n(examinations of Russians).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n7.

The 214th Reserve\r\nRegiment coming from the dissolved 46th Reserve Division, replaced the\r\n361st Regiment.\r\n\r\n9. The division was engaged near the La Bassee Canal from September 16\r\nto October 1. It rested until the 16th, when it was reengaged southwest\r\nof Lille. In the retreat it fell back by Wavrin, Seclin, Cysoing, Ere,\r\nMons and Blaugies.

At mobilization the 4th Bavarian Division, with the 3d Bavarian\r\nDivision, formed the 2d Bavarian Army Corps. It transferred its 8th\r\nBrigade (Metz Garrison) to the 33d Reserve Division and replaced it by\r\nthe 5th Bavarian Reserve Brigade, organized in the Palatinate. The other\r\nbrigade, the 7th, detrained, commencing August 3, between Morhange and\r\nRemilly. The reserve brigade detrained August 10 at St. Avold. Assembled\r\nthe 18th in the rear of the Metz-Strasbourg Railroad and with the 2d\r\nBavarian Army Corps constituted the 6th Army (Crown Prince Ruprecht of\r\nBavaria).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. On August 20 it fought west of Morhange. Then it captured the fort of\r\nManonviller (with the 22d Bavarian of the 3d Bavarian Division) and\r\nadvanced to Mortagne, south of Luniville. September 11 it was withdrawn\r\nto the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. September 18 the division entrained at Metz for Namur, from where it\r\nwent to the north of Peronne (Sept. 25). It then became part of the 2d\r\nArmy and fought from September 26 to the middle of October in the region\r\nnorth of the Somme (Fricout, Mametz, Montauban).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. During the third and fourth weeks of October (beginning the 23d) it\r\nwent to Flanders (6th Army) south of Ypres. It held the sector of\r\nWytschaete from November 14 to October 15 and was on the defensive.\r\nNovember 9 the 5th Infantry was reduced to less than 800 men\r\n(notebooks).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1915, the 8th Reserve Infantry was transferred from this\r\ndivision to the 10th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. September 26, 1915, some of its units fought on the Loos-Hulluch\r\nfront at the time of the British attack. In the counter attack, during\r\nwhich these troops retook ditch No. 8, they suffered severe losses.\r\n\r\nIn November the whole division was in the region of Loos south of\r\nHulluch, where it stayed until August 16. In this sector it carried on\r\nmine warfare. About the end of April, 1916, it lost 1,100 men while\r\nattempting a gas attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Toward the end of August, 1916, the division was sent to the Somme.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged between Martinpuich and Longueval, where it fought\r\nviolent battles for the Bois Haut (Aug. 25–28 to Sept. 15). Its total\r\nlosses were 5,361 men, or 60 per cent of its effectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Again sent to Flanders and held the sector northeast of Armentieres\r\n(east of the Bois de Ploegsteert) from October 16 to June 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1917, while still in line in front of Bois de Ploegsteert,\r\nit was in part subjected to the British attack against Messines ridge,\r\nand suffered especially from the artillery preparations. It lost 200\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved from the Belgian front about June 16 and sent to rest in the\r\nregion of Audenarde until July 7.\r\n\r\n3. Beginning July 9, it was engaged southeast of Armentieres (between\r\nthe Lys and Wez-Macquart) July and August.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the Armentieres sector in the middle of September and\r\nwent into line northeast of Ypres, between Zonnebeke and Passchendaele,\r\nfrom September 26 to October 27. Suffered heavy losses (30 per cent of\r\nits forces).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. October 11 entrained at Pitthem and went to Conflans the 13th from\r\nwhere it went into line in the region of Thiaucourt (Limey sector).

As soon as it is filled up again this division shall again\r\ntake its place on the most effective fronts (December, 1917).\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that February, 1918, it is not yet completely filled\r\nup and does not seem to be in shape for an offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the quiet Thiaucourt sector until late March\r\nwhen it was relieved by the 40th Division. On April 14 it entrained at\r\nNancieulles and traveled via Audun le Romain-Longuyon-Sedan-Charleville-\r\nHirson-Avesnes-Denain-Orchies to Rouchin. It marched to Armentieres,\r\narriving on April 16, and proceeded to reserve near Bailleul on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEMMEL.\r\n\r\n2. On the 23d of April the division came into line northeast of\r\nDranoutre, suffered heavy losses about here, and was relieved about May\r\n1.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested until June 11 in the north of France. During this\r\ntime it was reviewed by the King of Bavaria and Prince Franz. The\r\ndivision commander was decorated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. It returned to line near Merris about June 11. It continued in line,\r\nsuffering heavy losses until July 10.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested out of line until August 17.\r\n\r\n6. It was reengaged on August 17 east of Bucquoy, coming from Lille via\r\nCambrai Velu Beugny. It was withdrawn from the battle north of Bapaume\r\non August 25, after losing 1,600 prisoners.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested near Tourcoing until late in September.\r\n\r\n8. On September 29 the division was identified in line in Champagne,\r\nnorth of Maure. Its composition had been changed by the disbandment of\r\nthe 5th Bavarian Reserve Regiment and the substitution of the 4th\r\nBavarian Regiment from the dissolved 14th Bavarian Division. The\r\ndivision continued on this front, with short periods in the second line,\r\nuntil November 4. It was identified north of Marvaux (October 4), near\r\nMonthois (October 11), between Namdy and Falaise (October 19). The\r\ndivision was considered in reserve 3d Army between November 4 and the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was of the first quality. It saw heavy fighting and showed\r\nitself very aggressive in attack and tenacious in defense. The extensive\r\nreplacements which have been necessary did not improve the morale, but\r\ndue to the high quality and spirit of the organization, it was always to\r\nbe considered as a first-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   4th Cavalry Division (Dismounted).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                        │                     1918\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n                        │       Brigade.        │       Regiment.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n                        │39 Cav.                │38 Ldw.

Its regiments are extremely good.\r\n\r\nThe Division had been brought to the Aisne to retake the Californie\r\nPlateau, and it showed wonderful energy in this work (July 19, 1917).\r\nOctober 23, 1917, at the Chemin des Dames, in spite of its great losses\r\nand of the fact that the 1918 class formed about 20 per cent of its\r\neffectives, the division showed great resistance, and left only a\r\ncomparatively small number of prisoners in our hands (about 300).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division arrived at Fourmies on January 10 for training and\r\nmaneuvers. About February 14 it marched to Avesnes, where it rested\r\nuntil March 5. It then marched to St. Quentin by night marches, passing\r\nthrough Homblieres, Dallow, Happencourt, Tugny, and crossed the Crozat\r\nCanal between Ham and St. Simon on March 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the night of the 23d it relieved the 45th Reserve Division in\r\nfront of Golancourt, where it met a lively resistance. From the 24th to\r\nthe 27th it was in army reserve resting in the region Golancourt le\r\nPlesses Patte d’Oie. On the 28th it moved\r\n\r\nby Flavy le Meldux, Ecuvilly, Catigny, Candor, and entered line west of\r\nLassigny on the 29th, relieving the 1st Bavarian Division. On the 30th\r\nit attacked west of the Roye sur Matz railroad but was stopped by our\r\ncounterattacks. Until April 10 the division was in line at Beuvraignes\r\nand at Roye sur Matz. On the 8th it received 400 men, mostly of the 1919\r\nclass, in reinforcements.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from line on April 4, the division moved by degrees to the\r\nnortheast of Laon on April 24, where it was reorganized, reinforced, and\r\nrested near Rozay sur Serre. By night marches it moved to the Aisne\r\nfront and entered line on May 26, between Corbeny and the Californie\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. It fought in the offensive from May 27 to 30, advancing by\r\nGuyencourt, Fismes, Crugny, Cierges, and Vincelles. Between May 31 and\r\nJune 7 it was in reserve at Coulonges, Sergy, Beuvardes, Grisolles, and\r\nSommelous. The division was reengaged northwest of Chateau Thierry on\r\nJune 7 against the American 2d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATEAU THIERRY.\r\n\r\n5. In the three weeks the division was in the Torcy-Hautevesnes sector\r\nit lost most heavily. Several companies of the 20th Regiment were\r\nannihilated on June 8–9; the others were reduced to 30–40 rifles. The\r\ndivision lost about one-half its effectives in this period.\r\n\r\n6. It was withdrawn about June 30 and reconstituted in reserve of the\r\nTorcy sector near Coincy from July 1 to 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n7. The division came back on the 18th and engaged in rear-guard fighting\r\nnear Monthiers and Grisolles. It was engaged on defensive works near\r\nBlanzy les Fismes from July 29 to August 8.\r\n\r\n8. It rested in the region of Bruyeres from August 2–8, when it was\r\ntransported to Belgium by Marle-Hirson to rest. On the 31st it was\r\nalerted and entrained, the regiments following with a day’s interval by\r\nMauberg-St. Quentin, detraining at Laon and Crepy en Laonnois. From that\r\npoint it moved by foot to Vauxaillon front.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE-AILETTE.\r\n\r\n9. On September 3 the division relieved the 238th Division east of\r\nLouilly. In the succeeding days it suffered very heavily. It was\r\nrelieved on September 16.\r\n\r\n10. The division left the Laon area on September 16 and detrained that\r\nnight at St. Juvin, where it rested until September 24. The heavy losses\r\nof the division were made good while there.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n11. It entered the line opposite the American 1st Army on September 27\r\nin the region of Montblainville. After heavy losses, which caused a\r\npartial disintegration of the division, it withdrew on October 8. The 3d\r\nGuard Grenadier Regiment was practically destroyed in this fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n12. It was transported to the Woevre and on October 19 was engaged east\r\nof Verdun at Chatillon sous les Cotes. Here it remained until the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a first-class division, but after its rough\r\nhandling in the Hautevesnes-Torcy sector it lost much of its value as an\r\nattack division.\r\n\r\nBoth on the Aisne in September and in the Argonne the division’s losses\r\nwere extremely heavy. Battalions were reduced to three companies in\r\nOctober. By the 20th of October the remnants of the companies were\r\ncombined to make one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             5th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │9.       │8 Body   │9.       │8 Body   │10.      │8 Body\r\n              │         │  Gren.  │         │  Gren.  │         │  Gren.\r\n              │         │48.      │         │48.      │         │12 Gren.\r\n              │10.      │12 Gren. │10.      │12 Gren. │         │52.\r\n              │         │52.      │         │52.      │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Hus.

After its return from Italy the division rested and trained at\r\nChenois, near Charleville, from January 1 to March 1, when it moved to\r\nAnderlues-Resbaix (west of Charleroi) from March 1 to 14. On that date\r\nit moved to the front by night marches by Maubeuge, Landrecies,\r\nWassigny, and Etaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It took its place in line between Lesdins and Remancourt (north of\r\nSt. Quentin) on the night of March 20–21. The next day it was engaged in\r\nsupport of the 25th Division, advancing via Morcourt and Fayet. It took\r\npart in the attack on Holnon Wood and reached Attilly that night. It\r\ncontinued to advance on the 22d via Beauvois-Lanchy-Uguy-Quivieres-\r\nCroix-Moleguaux to a point east of Falvy. On the 24th it forced the\r\ncrossing of the Somme at Falvy and Pargny and reached Morchain that\r\nnight. It was at Omilcourt on the 25th and captured Chaulnes on the\r\n26th; from there it advanced to Fouquescourt and Rouvroy on the 27th,\r\ncrossed the Avre, and when the line stabilized near Aubvillers the\r\ndivision withdrew, March 28. Its losses in the fighting were extremely\r\nheavy. In crossing the Somme it especially distinguished itself.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested until April 3, when it was reengaged between\r\nSauvillers and Grivesnes from April 3–12. It again lost heavily,\r\nespecially the 52d Regiment, during the attack of April 4 near the Bois\r\nde Arrachies.\r\n\r\n4. It rested and trained from April 13 to May 23 at Iron et Vadencourt,\r\nnear Guise. It is known to have received 1,000 men from Beverloo on\r\nApril 14. From May 23 to 26 it marched toward the Aisne front by night,\r\nthrough Parpeville, Monceau le Neuf, Aisis sur Serre, Couvron,\r\nLaniscourt, Foucancourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n5. On the night of June 26 it entered line southeast of Lizy. In the\r\noffensive the division advanced by Chavignon, Malmaison, Uregny, region\r\nof Pommiers, Mercin, Pernant, east of Ambleny. It was partially relieved\r\non June 7 and the last elements withdrawn by June 13.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested between Guise and Le Nouvion (Mannappes Lechelle)\r\nfrom the middle of June to July 18. During this period the Spanish\r\nsickness ravished the troops. Reinforcements reconstituted the division\r\nduring this period. On July 19 the division was transported to Anezy le\r\nChateau by way of Wassigny, Guise, Mesbricourt. By marches it moved by\r\nsteps to south of Soissons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n7. On July 21 the division was engaged near Buzancy. It fell back to the\r\nVesle by Acy on August 1–2. It remained in the sector south of Vailly\r\n(Ciry-Salsogne, Sermoise) until September 5, when it retired to the line\r\nVailly-Celle sur Aisne. After losing more than 1,000 prisoners it was\r\nrelieved on September 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nARDENNES.\r\n\r\n8. The division was reengaged in the region of Jonchery on September 28.\r\nIt retired north of the Aisne (Sept. 30) toward Berry au Bac. Again\r\nretreated October 10 by Prouvais, La Malmaison, to Nizy le Comte. It was\r\nin line there until October 17, when it retired to the second line for a\r\nweek. It was reengaged in the same region from October 25 to November 5,\r\nwhen it retreated by Rozoy and Brunehamel with extremely heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nBefore the summer of 1918 the 5th Division was an excellent assault\r\ndivision, frequently mentioned in German communiques. But after August,\r\n1918, it became a sector-holding division. It was almost constantly in\r\nline after July 21 with consequent lowering of morale and discipline. In\r\nNovember it had but two battalions per regiment and three companies per\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         5th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │9 Res.   │8 Res.   │9 Res.   │8 Res.   │10 Res.  │8 Res.\r\n              │         │48 Res.  │         │48 Res.  │         │12 Res.\r\n              │10 Res.  │12 Res.  │10 Res.  │12 Res.  │         │48 Res.\r\n              │         │52 Res.  │         │52 Res.  │         │\r\n              │ 3 Res.

At the beginning of the war the division belonged to the 1st Army\r\n(Von Kluck). Detrained at Crefeld from August 10 to 12; entered Belgium\r\nthe 18th. The 3d Reserve Corps was sent to France. The division was at\r\nMalines on August 22, at Vilvorde the 26th, and fought against the\r\nBelgians on that day. The 3d Reserve Corps then turned toward Antwerp,\r\nwhich it besieged. After the city was taken the corps advanced toward\r\nthe sea through Ghent, Bruges, October 13 to 16. The 19th the 5th\r\nReserve Division attacked in the direction of Nieuport. At the beginning\r\nof November it fought in the vicinity of Bixschoote, in the forest of\r\nHouthulst; then until the end of November it held the Dixmude-Langmarck\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. About December 2 the division entrained for the eastern front. On\r\narriving in Russia it became part of Mackensen’s army (9th Army). It was\r\nsent to the Bzura.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1915, the division was attached to the 10th Army and\r\ntook part in the battle of Prasnysz.\r\n\r\n2. In May one of its brigades remained before Kovno with the 10th Army\r\n(Gen. von Eichhorn). The other brigade joined the 3d Reserve Corps of\r\nthe 9th Army (Gen. von Fabeck) and fought on the Bzura. The 52d Reserve\r\nInfantry was transferred to the 107th Division.\r\n\r\n3. In July the division was reorganized. It was attached to the 9th Army\r\nbefore Warsaw and fought between the Bzura and the Pilica.\r\n\r\n4. In November, after crossing the Vistula and the Bug it arrived before\r\nBaranovitchi. It remained in this region until March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. On January 1, 1916, it held the eastern sector of Novo-Grudok, north\r\nof Baranovitchi.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of April the division was placed in reserve behind\r\nthis sector.\r\n\r\n3. During the first two weeks of July it was engaged between Gorodivche\r\nand Baranovitchi to oppose the Russian offensive started on this part of\r\nthe front. On July 8 it suffered heavy losses. (The 8th Reserve had\r\n1,200 men out of action.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. It was relieved in this area about the middle of April and sent to\r\nthe Western Front.\r\n\r\n2. Entrained between the 17th and 18th of April at Molczacz\r\n(Baranovitchi sector) and went to France, via Brest-Litovsk-Warsaw-\r\nOppeln-Breslau-Goerlitz-Dresden-Leipzig-Sondershausen-Frankfort on Main-\r\nSarrebrucken-Metz. It detrained at Mars la Tour.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. It was then sent to St. Maurice sous les Cotes, where it rested for a\r\nfew days and then went to the Cotes de Meuse, east of the Combres\r\nHeights. It went into the sector before Combres (Calonne trench) on May\r\n15 or 16, and there became accustomed to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved May 27, it was sent behind the Aisne front; spent about\r\nthree weeks in the Sissonne region, and about June 19 went into line on\r\nCalifornie Plateau near Chaevreux. On June 24, July 3 and 22, the\r\ndivision executed some violent attacks on Californie Plateau, and some\r\nof its units lost half their men.\r\n\r\n5. Partially relieved about July 23, the units of the division were sent\r\nto rest successively at St. Erme, Ramecourt, and La Selve. Before August\r\n10 it was back on Californie Plateau (region of Craonne south of\r\nCorbeny).\r\n\r\n6. The division took part on the same position in the general retreat of\r\nNovember 1 which brought the German lines back to the north of the\r\nAilette following the French attack of La Malmaison. The division\r\nremained on these new lines (south and west of Corbeny) until January\r\n22, 1918.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved on this date and put through a course of training in the\r\nregion of Chimay. On February 18 it marched to the sector of Juvincourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nBrandenburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is considered by the Germans as a very good division. Its\r\noriginal elements came from the best corps, the Brandenburg corps, but\r\nit contains a large proportion of Poles. The division needs rest and\r\nreplacements. When reconstituted it will probably again be a good unit.\r\n(Dec. 29, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n1. On February 21 the division relieved the 113th Division at\r\nJuvincourt, which sector it held until March 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was withdrawn to reinforce the battle front at Chauny, where it\r\nappeared on April 2. About April 11, it retired to second line, from\r\nwhich it returned to the battle front on April 25, relieving the 242d\r\nDivision at Couchy le Pots. The division continued to hold this sector\r\nuntil early June.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n3. Between June 1 and 10 it was moved from the Couchy le Pots sector to\r\nreinforce the Montdidier-Noyon battle front, where it was identified on\r\nJune 12 near Courcelles. It was withdrawn on June 17.\r\n\r\n4. During July the division rested in rear of the Amiens front.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. It came into line on August 8 at Trace le Mont. In the opening week\r\nof the offensive it lost many prisoners and retired from the line about\r\nAugust 20 to rest near St. Gobain. On the 29th it returned to line near\r\nArblencourt-Champs. It withdrew early in September but returned to\r\nsupport the 80th Reserve Division in a counterattack executed in the\r\nregion Sancy-Vauxillon September 16–18.\r\n\r\n6. Following this the division was rested near Laon. On October 7 it was\r\nentrained and moved to the region of Tupigny-Mennevret.\r\n\r\n7. It was engaged on October 9 to the east of Bohain before the extreme\r\nright of the 4th British Army. It was relieved in this sector on October\r\n23 by the 200th Division. At this time the division was very low in\r\neffectives; two regiments had three battalions of three companies and\r\none regiment had but two battalions. The average company strength was\r\nabout 50 men.\r\n\r\n8. Retired to rest for 15 days, the division returned to line on\r\nNovember 5, near Wiege Faty.

It comprised the 37th Landwehr Brigade (73d and\r\n74th Landwehr); until then attached to the 26th Reserve Corps, and the\r\n2d Reserve Ersatz Brigade (3d Ersatz Reserve and 4th Reserve Brigade),\r\nsituated in the Dixmude sector. With the 4th Ersatz Division, the\r\nBasedow Division, which became the 5th Ersatz Division in 1916,\r\nconstituted at the end of 1915 the Werde Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. From January to October, 1916 the division remained in Belgium\r\n(region of Yser, then southeast of Ypres). However, the 4th Ersatz\r\nReserve was transferred to the 206th Division at the beginning of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the Ypres front at the beginning of October, the\r\ndivision was sent to the Somme and engaged north of Courcelette from\r\nOctober 19 to 30.\r\n\r\n3. In November it was sent to rest behind the Champagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of December it was sent to Russia (the 73d Landwehr\r\nentrained December 11 northeast of Reims, via Dusseldorf-Hamburg-\r\nKoenigsburg-Tilsit-Poneviej. Detrained at Elovka the 16th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\nSent into line in the Illukst sector (region of Dvinsk) at the beginning\r\nof January 1917 and remained in this country during the whole year\r\n(Illukst, Lake Stenten, Kchtchava). Its losses were very small—17 killed\r\nand 20 wounded in the 3d Ersatz Reserve from the end of December, 1916,\r\nto the end of August, 1917. Because the sector was so quiet the division\r\nhad only small forces during the last months of 1917. The 73d Landwehr\r\nat the end of November had only 60 to 65 men per company (examination of\r\nRussians).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division remained for a long time in the quiet sectors of the\r\nRussian front and seems to have had only moderate fighting value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. The 5th Ersatz Division was still in the vicinity of Dvinsk in\r\nFebruary.

The division advanced into Livonia (in March) and remained in the\r\nPskov-Ostrov region as late as June 27th. The 74th Landwehr Regiment was\r\nidentified here on August 6, but the rest of the division was identified\r\nnear Mitau during July.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of October, it was reported that the division, having\r\nbeen refitted, had come to the Western Front via Trier and Rethel;\r\nhowever, the division was never actually identified on the Western\r\nFront.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as 4th class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         5th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │14 Ldw.  │36 Ldw.  │14 Ldw.  │36 Ldw.  │14 Ldw.  │36 Ldw.\r\n              │         │66 Ldw.  │         │66 Ldw.  │         │66 Ldw.\r\n              │         │17 Ldw.  │30 Ldw.  │25 Ldw.  │30 Ldw.  │25 Ldw.\r\n              │30 Ldw.  │25 Ldw.  │         │65 Ldw.  │         │65 Ldw.\r\n              │         │65 Ldw.  │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │4 Sqn. 1 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │                   │                   │1 and 2 Landst. 4\r\n              │                   │                   │  C.

The 17th Landwehr was under the 14th Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. During the first days of September the 14th Landwehr Brigade was\r\nengaged at Fresnes and Marcheville (in Woevre), near the 33d Reserve\r\nDivision. It fought on the Cotes de Meuse, near Champlon and Les\r\nEparges, at the beginning of October and suffered heavy losses there.\r\n\r\n2. In December the two brigades (14th Landwehr Brigade and 30th Landwehr\r\nBrigade) were united in the Woevre (Warcq, Hennemont, Marcheville,\r\nChamplon, Saulx). The division at that time was part of the Von Strantz\r\ndetachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the sector between Warcq and Saulx en Woevre\r\nduring the whole of 1915. In January the 17th Landwehr, from which many\r\nmen had deserted, was sent to Russia, where it assisted in the formation\r\nof the 85th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. At the time of the Verdun offensive the division was present during\r\nthe attacks on the Cotes de Meuse, near Braquis, Ronvaux, Manhuelles, at\r\nthe end of February to March, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of March the 14th Landwehr Brigade took the place of\r\nthe First Guard Ersatz Brigade (Guard Ersatz Division) in the Apremont\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n3. The 30th Landwehr Brigade was kept before the Cotes de Meuse (region\r\nof Fresnes en Woevre) until July. It then rejoined the other brigade\r\neast of St. Mihiel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST OF APREMONT.\r\n\r\n1. The division from this time on did not leave the Forest of Apremont\r\nsector. In April, 1917, the 66th Landwehr was transferred to the 23d\r\nLandwehr Division, newly organized, and soon sent to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nA sector unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. On April 12 the division undertook a local operation in the Apremont\r\nsector in an effort to divert troops and artillery from the Somme front.\r\nAbout 800 men of the Storm Battalion were engaged. Forty-seven prisoners\r\nwere lost in the attack. Aside from this the sector continued very quiet\r\nuntil September 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n2. The division was engaged in the attack in the St. Mihiel salient. It\r\nlost heavily in prisoners, among whom were the entire staff of the 3d\r\nBattalion, 65th Landwehr Regiment, which was taken on September 12 in\r\nthe Bois de Thiaucourt. The division retreated with orders to take up\r\npositions between the first and second positions of the Hindenburg line.\r\nHere it had orders to hold the Mihiel Zone under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n3. The division continued in line until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Landwehr Division was rated as a fourth-class division. In 1918\r\nit held the Apremont sector continuously, showing no initiative or\r\ncapacity for offensive operation, but due to the small losses and heavy\r\neffectives it offered as much resistance to our attack in September as\r\ndid the other German divisions in the salient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         5th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │9 Bav.   │14 Bav.  │9 Bav.   │14 Bav.  │9 Bav.   │14 Bav.\r\n              │         │21 Bav.  │         │21 Bav.  │         │21 Bav.\r\n              │10 Bav.  │7 Bav.   │10 Bav.  │7 Bav.   │10 Bav.  │7 Bav.\r\n              │         │19 Bav.  │         │19 Bav.  │         │19 Bav.\r\n              │ 2 Bav.

At the beginning of the war the division was a part of the 3d\r\nBavarian Army Corps, with the 6th Bavarian Division, and was part of the\r\n6th Army (Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria). Detrained between Boulay\r\nand Courcelles from August 9 to 11, it fought August 20 on the right of\r\nthe 2d Bavarian Corps at Oron, Lusy, Fremery. Crossed the frontier on\r\nthe 22d and advanced to Sanon, fighting on the 25th at Serres and\r\nHoéville, and on September 2 at Einville Wood. During the days following\r\nit formed the left of the troops attacking Nancy by way of Champenoux.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n2. After its failure the division was assembled at Metz on September 13\r\nand 14. The 19th it was at Mars-la-Tour. From there going through La\r\nHaye it reached the Cotes de Meuse. The 7th Infantry took Nonsard the\r\n20th and Heudicourt the 21st. Marching on the left of the 6th Bavarian\r\nDivision, which went up the hill, the 5th Bavarian Division, walking\r\nalong the summit, established itself in the forest of Apremont at the\r\nbeginning of September 25 and held it during the whole of 1915, and,\r\nexcept for the months of October and November, 1915, during the summer\r\nof 1916. Its losses were quite high during the first two months of the\r\ncampaign. On October 14 the 1st Company of the 14th Infantry had only 1\r\nofficer and 41 men (notebooks).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. October 6, 1915, the division was sent to Champagne, via Audun le\r\nRoman-Longuyon-Sedan, to relieve the 16th Reserve Division which had\r\nbeen crushed by the French attack of September 25. It was engaged south\r\nof Tahure (La Courtine) beginning October 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of December it returned to its old sector east of\r\nSt. Mihiel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In July, 1916, the division was withdrawn from the St. Mihiel salient\r\nand sent to Artois. It held the Lens-Vimy sector until the end of\r\nAugust, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. September 7 to 8 it was engaged in the Somme (Delville Wood-Ginchy).\r\nIt suffered heavy losses in the fights around Ginchy and during the\r\nBritish attack of September 15 (Flers, Gueudecourt).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved September 20, it went back into line after a few days of\r\nrest in the sector Neuve-Chapelle, south of the Armentieres road.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained on the front south of Armentieres during the\r\nwhole winter 1916 to 1917. In February it was reduced to three regiments\r\non the transfer of the 14th Infantry to the 16th Bavarian Division,\r\nnewly organized.\r\n\r\n2. It left the lines at the end of April, but at the beginning of May\r\nwent to the sector north of Arras, where it fought heavily at Fresnoy on\r\nMay 7 and southeast of Gavrelle on June 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the Oppy-Gavrelle front July 1 and sent to rest near\r\nthe Belgian-Dutch front. It went through a period of training at the\r\nBrasschaet camp in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. About August 6 it entrained and went to Gits, via Lokeren, Ghent,\r\nThielt, and Pitthen. From there it went to Roulers. On August 10 held\r\nthe sector south of St. Julien, east of Ypres, where it suffered heavy\r\nlosses in the fighting of August 15 and days following. Relieved August\r\n24.\r\n\r\n5.

In 1917 it did well at Arras and on the Ypres front where it\r\nsuffered heavy losses (information from the British, February, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. About February 13 the division was relieved, moved to Tourcoing (Feb.\r\n14), and trained in that area until March 17, when it marched to\r\nRoubaix. It entrained and moved to Fressies (5 miles north of Cambrai),\r\nrested until the 19th, and moved to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged east of Cambrai (Vaux-Vrancourt) on March 22. Retiring\r\nto second line about April 4, it rested near Sapignies until about April\r\n11, when it was identified southeast of Boyelles. It was relieved by the\r\n111th Division on May 6.\r\n\r\n3. The division trained in the Somain area until May 22, when it was\r\nmoved by trucks via Cantin and Palluel to Ecourt. A day later it marched\r\nto Bullecourt and relieved the 221st Division on night of May 24–25.\r\nLieut. Gen. v. Endres, the division commander, was promoted to the\r\ncommand of the 1st Bavarian Corps about this time. The division was\r\nrelieved in the Boyelles sector on July 15 by the 21st Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. After resting behind the Arras Front the division entered the line\r\nnear Lihons on August 10. After suffering heavy losses it withdrew from\r\nthe battle front south of Peronne on September 24 and retired to the Le\r\nCateau region.\r\n\r\n5. It rested for a week and returned to the battle at Rumilly on the\r\nnight of September 30-October 1. About October 12, after heavy losses,\r\nit was withdrawn and rested near Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n6. On October 25 it was again put in line at Rameguies-Chin. It was last\r\nidentified at Mourcourt on November 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Bavarian Division was a first-class division.

The division constituted, with the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, the\r\n1st Bavarian Reserve Corps, and at the beginning of the war was part of\r\nthe army of Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria (6th Army). It detrained\r\nfrom August 11 to 13 between Sarreguemines and Sarralbe. It fought\r\nAugust 20 on the left of the 21st Corps at Loudrefeing, was engaged the\r\n26th at Maixe, September 2 at Deuxville, northwest of Luniville, and\r\nremained a few days longer behind Luniville.\r\n\r\n2. On September 13 it was in line on the Seille and the Paris-Avricourt\r\nRailroad and remained there until the last days of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. September 28 and 29 the division entrained at Metz. Detrained the\r\n30th and October 1 at Valenciennes. Engaged north of Arras (Roclincourt-\r\nCarency) in October and November and took position in the sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1915, the division was increased by the 39th Landwehr\r\nInfantry (Westphalian), coming from Brussels and sent as punishment to\r\nthe Artois front. In March and April two of its regiments were\r\ntransferred, the 6th Reserve to the 10th Bavarian Division, and the 13th\r\nto the 11th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. May 9, 1915, the division suffered very heavy losses during the\r\nFrench offensive of Carency-Souchez. (The 10th Reserve Infantry lost 35\r\nofficers and 1,711 men, the 1st Reserve Bavarian Battalion of Chasseurs\r\nlost 13 officers and 750 men.)\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of June the division was moved south of the Scarpe in\r\nfront of Arras (Blangy sector).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1916, the 39th Landwehr Infantry went to Russia.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in Artois until August, 1916, and was increased\r\nby a regiment from the 1st Bavarian Division (3d Reserve Infantry later\r\nreplaced by the 12th Reserve Infantry).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about August 7, the division was sent to the Somme and was\r\nengaged near Maurepas from the middle of August to September. Heavy\r\nlosses. August 19 the 2d Battalion of the 10th Reserve Infantry was\r\nreduced to 150 men (letter). September 1 the 3d Battalion of the 7th\r\nReserve Infantry borrowed 200 men from the 5th Bavarian Ersatz (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. In the middle of September the division was sent to the Aisne, where\r\nit held a quiet sector east of Craonne until the end of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. About December 9 the division returned to the Somme (south of\r\nSaillisel.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division was withdrawn from the Somme front at the end of\r\nJanuary, 1917, and sent to rest in the vicinity of Cambrai until April.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of April it was sent east of Laon to the region of\r\nSt. Erme, and reinforced the front south of Juvincourt between the\r\nMiette and the Aisne about April 12 in anticipation of the French\r\noffensive. It was subjected to the attack of the 16th and suffered heavy\r\nlosses (2,000 prisoners).\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the Aisne front about April 20, the division was\r\nreconstituted north of Laon (?), and on May 1 held the St. Mihiel sector\r\n(Chauvoncourt-Spada).\r\n\r\n4. October 7 it left the region of St. Mihiel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to Flanders and sent into line October 12 near the Ypres-Roulers\r\nRailroad (Zonnebeke). In November it was left of Artois, where it held,\r\nafter intervals of relief, a sector north of the Scarpe (from Gavrelle\r\nto Acheville).

Early in January the division was relieved in its sector north of the\r\nScarpe and went to rest north of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE.\r\n\r\n2. It was reengaged southeast of Gavrelle on February 21, when it was in\r\nline during the attack.

On April 7–8 it came in line south of Hebuterne, where it was engaged\r\nuntil April 16. After eight days’ rest it came into line south of the\r\nAyette, relieving the 195th Division on April 24. It was not withdrawn\r\nuntil July 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n4. The division moved to Muelhausen, via Belgium and Germany, a trip of\r\n10 days. While at rest there it was frequently alerted in anticipation\r\nof an expected Allied attack in that region. On September 4 it returned\r\nthrough Germany and Belgium to Douai, where the British were attacking.\r\n\r\n5. It left Douai on September 22, detraining at Dun sur Meuse on\r\nSeptember 23. From there the division marched to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. On September 27 it was engaged at Daunevoux. It was engaged\r\nthroughout the entire Meuse-Argonne battle on the American front. At\r\nMontfaucon it was forced back with heavy losses. The division affected\r\nrelief by regiments, which were sent to close support to be\r\nreconstituted by drafts. Five hundred replacements were received early\r\nin October. The initial company combat strength averaged 60 men. On\r\nNovember 4 this had been reduced to 20. During the retreat of November\r\n1–2 the division crossed the Meuse and took up a position on the east\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Bavarian Reserve Division was rated as a second-class division.\r\nApart from the Meuse-Argonne offensive, it did not see much heavy\r\nfighting during the year.

At the beginning of the war the 3d Army Corps belonged to the 1st\r\nArmy (Von Kluck). Entered Belgium August 4 and the 11th Brigade made\r\npart of the unit which attacked Liège. Its reservists rejoined it there.\r\nThe 12th Brigade crossed the Belgian frontier August 15; then the\r\ndivision, completely filled up, marched via Tongres, Louvain, and Hal.\r\nIt fought the 24th at Mons and Frameries. Going via Villers-Cotterets\r\n(Sept. 1), La Ferté-Milon, it arrived at Petit-Morin September 4.\r\nEngaged the 6th between Montceaux and Courgivaux on the left of the 5th\r\nDivision. Obliged to retreat, it established itself on the right bank of\r\nthe Aisne in the region of Soissons. It remained there until the end of\r\nJune, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. From October 30 to November 30, 1914, the division, reinforced by\r\nunits of neighboring organizations, directed a successful offensive\r\nagainst the French troops in the region Chavonne-Soupir and threw them\r\nback on the left bank of the Aisne November 17 to 19, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. From the end of January to July, 1915, the Aisne front was held by\r\nthe division and remained quiet, the division suffering no losses. At\r\nthe end of March the 35th Fusilier Regiment was transferred to 56th\r\nDivision (new division).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved from the region of Soissons toward the end of June and sent\r\nto Artois. On July 14 it took the place of the Bavarians before Arras.\r\nWithdrawn from the front toward the beginning of August and sent to rest\r\nbetween Valenciennes and Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n3. September 23 it entrained for the Eastern Front. With the 25th\r\nReserve Division it constituted, on the Serbo-Hungarian frontier, a new\r\n3d Army Corps belonging to the Gallwitz Army. October 9 it crossed the\r\nDanube and remained in Serbia until the capture of Kragujewatz. During\r\nthis October campaign the division suffered greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. Returned to the Western Front at the beginning of December. Sent to\r\nrest and reorganized in the region Hirson-Avesnes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January and the beginning of February, 1916, it was\r\nsent to the front north of Verdun (Romagne-Mangiennes area).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. February 22 it was engaged with the 5th Division in the zone between\r\nthe western limits of Herbebois and the eastern slopes of the Cotes de\r\nMeuse. The two divisions did not go beyond Fort Douaumont, captured by\r\nthe 24th Infantry. Their violent attacks on the village February 26 to\r\n28 were repulsed. March 2 the regiments were withdrawn from the front\r\nand filled up.\r\n\r\n3. On March 8 new and unsuccessful attacks against the village of\r\nDouaumont and the Hardaumont defenses.\r\n\r\n4. About March 15 the 3d Army Corps was withdrawn from the front. The\r\n6th Division went to the region of Mulhouse to be reorganized. On April\r\n25 the division was again engaged (south of Douaumont-Caillette Wood)\r\nand again suffered heavily. It is probable that each of its regiments\r\nwere completely reorganized after each attack at Douaumont (more than 60\r\nper cent losses).\r\n\r\n6. At the end of May the division was relieved and sent to rest in the\r\nregion of Ville au Montois.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n7. In the middle of June it was sent to Champagne and occupied quiet\r\nsectors northeast of Prunay, then east of Auberive. It remained there\r\ntill the end of September. It exchanged its 20th Infantry Regiment for\r\nthe 396th Infantry Regiment, organized September 26. (See illustration.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n8. At the beginning of October sent to the Somme and was engaged in the\r\nregion of Gueudecourt and again suffered heavily, October 8 to 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n9. Withdrawn from the Somme front at the end of October; went to the\r\nArgonne in the sector Fille-Morte-Boureuilles, November 30 to beginning\r\nof April, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of April, 1917, the division was sent to Alsace. It\r\nstayed about two weeks in the region of Mulhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. About April 20 sent to Champagne and took over a sector south of\r\nMoronvilliers where it was subjected to the French attack of April 30.\r\nIt had to be relieved a few days after, as it suffered great losses at\r\nMont-Haut (50 to 75 men per company).\r\n\r\n3. The division returned to Alsace and was reorganized behind the front\r\nin the region of Mulhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. About July 1 sent to the Eastern Front in Galicia, where it held a\r\nsector in the Skalat region.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nWithdrawn from this front at the beginning of October it entrained for\r\nFrance, beginning the 7th, southeast of Tarnopol, and traveled via\r\nLemberg-Cracow-Dresden-Cassel-Coblentz-Treves-Thionville-Montmedy-\r\nCharleville-Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. After staying a few days around Vouziers and Marle the division was\r\nsent on October 23, the date of the French offensive, precipitately near\r\nLaon. October 24 and 25 it took over a sector on the Ailette in the\r\nregion of Lizy (Urcel sector) and was still holding it January 24, 1918,\r\nafter a period of rest in Laon in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSame remarks as for the 5th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Army Corps was always considered as one of the star corps of the\r\nPrussian Army. The 6th Division was among the best in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe military qualities seem to have been considerably lessened after the\r\nlosses suffered, notably before Verdun and in the Mont Haut sector. It\r\nmust be noted, however, that, according to the examination of a deserter\r\non November 2, 1917, the 396th Regiment is still considered as an\r\nexcellent unit whose morale is intact.\r\n\r\nLosses before Verdun (February to May, 1916): 20th Infantry, 2,904 men\r\n(633 killed); 24th Infantry, 2,691 (584 killed); 64th Infantry, 2,819\r\n(603 killed); 3d Battalion of Chasseurs, 1,422 (219 killed). Total,\r\n9,831 men (2,039 killed).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved by the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division\r\nJanuary 12. It, in turn, relieved the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division the\r\n24th. February 22 it was again relieved by the 6th Bavarian Reserve\r\nDivision. It rested then in the Maubeuge area, where it underwent a\r\nthorough course of training. The division then marched via Catillon,\r\nBohain, Fresnoy le Grand, Le Verguier, Berthaucourt, Vermand,\r\nMarteville, Trefcon, Monchy Lagache.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERONNE.\r\n\r\n2. It came into line S. E. of that city near Meharicourt, March 24,\r\nrelieving the 113th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. It was withdrawn from line about the 10th of April, and went to the\r\nGuise area, where, with the 5th Division, it was put through another\r\ncourse of training. It reinforced the battle front near Juvigny, May 27.\r\nIt was withdrawn from line August 4.\r\n\r\nIt moved via Anizy le Chateau, southwest of Laon, Guise, Grougis,\r\nBohain, Bertry, Neuvilly, Solesmes, Valenciennes, Ghent, to Turkyen\r\n(northwest of Roulers). The division remained here until September 7,\r\nwhen it entrained at Roulers and traveled via Lille and Denain to Iwuy,\r\nremaining in reserve in the Sancourt-Proville area until the 14th, when\r\nit was moved up into support near Ribecourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of September 17–18 it reentered the line and\r\ncounterattacked against Havrincourt (southwest of Cambrai). It was\r\nwithdrawn October 1, after suffering heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. The division came back into line near Escadoeuvres (northeast of\r\nCambrai), October 7. It was withdrawn on the 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIENNES.\r\n\r\n6. October 23 the division entered line near Escautpont (north of\r\nValenciennes).\r\n\r\n7. It was withdrawn a few days later, and reappeared in line south of\r\nValenciennes on the 29th. The night of November 7–8 it was relieved by\r\nthe 185th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAccording to an article by Prof. Wegener in the Koelnische Zeitung,\r\nMarch 30, the 6th Division “particularly distinguished itself” in the\r\nSomme offensive. It did very well, too, in the Aisne attack and also in\r\nthe German attempts to prevent the Allied advance beginning July 18. It\r\nsuffered very heavy losses—e. g., 1,550 prisoners in its two engagements\r\non the Cambrai front during September and early October; nevertheless,\r\nit is still to be considered as one of the best German shock divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         6th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COMPOSITION.[6]\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │11  Res. │20 Res.  │11 Res.  │20 Res.  │11 Res.  │20 Res.\r\n              │         │24 Res.  │         │24 Res.  │         │35 Res.\r\n              │12  Res. │26 Res.  │12 Res.  │26 Res.  │12 Res.  │24 Res.\r\n              │         │35 Res.  │         │35 Res.  │         │19\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Res.

At the beginning of the war the 3d Reserve Corps belonged to the 1st\r\nGerman Army (Gen. von Kluck). The 6th Reserve Division detrained August\r\n10 in the region of Crefeld, entered Belgium the 17th, passed through\r\nBelgian Limburg at the beginning of September, moved on Malines to\r\noppose the Belgian offensive. September 9 the division attacked the\r\nBelgian troops in the region of Louvain and then took part in the siege\r\nof Antwerp.\r\n\r\n\r\nYSER.\r\n\r\n2. After the fall of Antwerp it moved toward the sea from October 13 to\r\n16, through Ghent, Bruges, and Ostend. It concentrated near Thourout\r\nOctober 19 and fought along the Yser Canal. It fought violently in the\r\nregion of Nieuport-Dixmude at the end of October and the beginning of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of December the 3d Reserve Corps went to Russia, the\r\n6th Reserve Division being withdrawn from the Belgian front about the\r\nmiddle of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. On arriving on the Eastern Front the division was engaged on the\r\nBzura and before Warsaw (9th Army, under Mackensen).\r\n\r\n2. In July, 1915, it became a part of Von Buelow’s army, which marched\r\non the left wing (north) of the German forces during the offensive\r\nagainst Russia (summer and fall of 1915).\r\n\r\n\r\nDVINA.\r\n\r\n3. In November the division still belonged to Von Buelow’s army, called\r\nthe Niemen army, and was engaged on the Dvina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1916, the division (8th Army under Von Buelow) held a\r\nsector in the region of Riga-Friedrichstadt.\r\n\r\n2. During its stay in Russia the division did not have very heavy losses\r\nexcept in July, 1916, when it opposed violent Russian attacks near\r\nKekkau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved from the Kekkau sector in May, 1917, and was sent to the\r\nWestern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. Entrained about May 6 at Mitau and sent via Cottbus, Cassel,\r\nCoblentz, Treves, Thionville to Dun, where it detrained May 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORT HOMME-HILL 304.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of May the division went into line on the left bank of the\r\nMeuse in the sector Mort Homme-Hill 304. On June 29 some of the units of\r\nthe division supported an attack attempted by the 10th Reserve Division\r\nagainst Hill 304 and suffered heavy losses. August 20 the French\r\noffensive struck them. Its losses were enormous. Two of its regiments,\r\nthe 24th Reserve and 20th Reserve, were nearly wiped out. The 35th\r\nReserve was not weakened quite so much, yet was seriously diminished.\r\nThe division lost 2,800 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the front, the division was sent to Galicia at the end\r\nof September. It was still there January 31 on the old Austro-Russian\r\nfrontier after furnishing reinforcements to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nBrandenburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Reserve Division, a short time after its return from the Eastern\r\nFront, was considered about as follows: “Its value is mediocre. In spite\r\nof its units from Brandenburg and the recent creation of shock troops,\r\nits long stay in Russia has greatly depreciated its fighting value”\r\n(July 11, 1917).\r\n\r\nThis judgment was completely verified August 20, 1917: “The 6th Reserve\r\nDivision on the whole opposed no resistance to the French attack of\r\nAugust 20 at any point. * * * The conduct of a good number of its\r\nofficers seems not to have been edifying. A good many seized the pretext\r\nof intoxication or gave unsatisfactory reasons for withdrawing to the\r\nrear” (October, 1917).\r\n\r\nThe German command thought best to send this division back to the\r\nEastern Front (September, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Reserve Division entrained at Zborow the evening of March 8, and\r\ntraveled via Sokal-Brest Litovsk-Varsovia-Kaliscz-Lissa-Gorlitz-Bautzen-\r\nDresden-Leipsic-Weimar-Erfurth-Eisenach-Bebra-Fulda-Hanau-Frankfort-\r\nMainz-Kreuznach-Thionville-Sedan to Balhain (northeast of Asfeld), where\r\nit arrived March 15.\r\n\r\nThe division rested at Villers (near Asfeld) until the 25th of March,\r\nwhen it reentrained and traveled to Crécy sur Serre. From there it\r\nmarched via Mesbrecourt-Pouilly sur Serre-La Fère-Liez-Commonchon to the\r\narea northeast of Noyon, and remained in reserve for some days. Elements\r\nof the division came into line west of Chauny at the end of March, but\r\nwere soon withdrawn. About the 1st of April the whole division marched\r\nto Roye and remained there until the 15th, when it continued its march\r\nvia Erches and Arvillers to Plessier, relieving the 2d Guard Division\r\nsouthwest of Moreuil May 1.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of August it was relieved by the 24th Division and shortly\r\nafter it was dissolved and the men composing it were sent as drafts to\r\nthe 5th and 6th Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe only aggressive action of the division on the Western Front during\r\n1918 was a raid carried out by a battalion against the French lines in\r\nthe La Gaune woods (southwest of Moreuil) early in May; it was not a\r\nsuccess, and it is estimated that practically the whole attacking force\r\nwas wiped out. The 6th Reserve is rated as a third-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         6th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │11  Bav. │10 Bav.  │11 Bav.  │10 Bav.  │11 Bav.  │10 Bav.\r\n              │         │13 Bav.  │         │13 Bav.  │         │13 Bav.\r\n              │12  Bav. │6 Bav.   │12 Bav.  │6 Bav.   │12 Bav.  │6 Bav.\r\n              │         │11 Bav.  │         │11 Bav.  │         │11 Bav.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Bav.

In August, 1914, the 6th Bavarian Division with the 5th Bavarian\r\nDivision constituted the 3d Bavarian Corps and was part of the 6th\r\nBavarian Army (Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria). One of its brigades,\r\nthe 11th, detrained, beginning August 4, at Remilly as a covering force.\r\nAugust 20 the division fought on the right of the 5th Bavarian Division\r\nat Prevecourt and Delme. They crossed the French frontier with this\r\ndivision on the 22d and were engaged the 25th at Maixe on the Sanon and\r\nnorth of Luneville during the first days of September. Also with the 5th\r\nBavarian Division, it was near Champenoux September 8, at the time of\r\nthe attack against Nancy until the 11th, and then retreated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. Assembled at Metz from the 14th to the 17th, the division went on the\r\n18th to the west of the Moselle. It reached and climbed the Cotes de\r\nMeuse the 21st and attacked the fort of the Camp des Romains and St.\r\nMihiel the 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n3. Following these attacks which continued during October and ended in\r\nthe capture of the fort and of St. Mihiel, the division established\r\nitself from Chauvoncourt to Spada in November to December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the sector of the St. Mihiel salient\r\n(Chauvoncourt-Spada-Lamorville) during the whole of 1915 and until June,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. About June 20, 1916, the 11th Bavarian Brigade was relieved from the\r\nSt. Mihiel sector and sent to Longuyon and from there to the Verdun\r\nfront. It participated in opposing the French attack of June 23 (with\r\nthe Alpine Corps) on Thiaumont and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to rest July 4.\r\n\r\n3. The 12th Brigade withdrew from the St. Mihiel front July 13 and 16\r\nand went into line before Fleury, beginning July 17 to 18 (11th\r\nRegiment). Its losses were such that on July 26 the replacement depot of\r\nthe 11th Infantry at Ratisbonne was ordered by telegraph to furnish\r\nimmediately 500 replacements (letter).\r\n\r\n4. On August 2 and 3 the whole division was fighting in this sector and\r\nlost heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. The division left the Verdun front about August 5. After a short stay\r\nin the Argonne it was sent to the Somme at the beginning of September,\r\nfought between Flers and Gueudecourt September 15 to 27 and again\r\nsuffered serious losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. On August 1 the division took over the sector of Neuve Chapelle-\r\nFestubert, and remained there until May 10, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1917, the 11th Infantry and the 3d Field\r\nArtillery were transferred to the 6th Bavarian Division (new).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved from the Neuve Chapelle sector May 10 and\r\nwent into line northeast of Arras (Oppy, Fresnoy, Acheville), in the\r\nmiddle of May. They suffered some loss from gas attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. The division left Artois September 10 and went to Flanders (sector\r\nnortheast of Langemarck) September 29. The British attack of October 4\r\ncaused it heavy losses and it lost Poelcappelle to the British.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved October 8, sent to rest, and reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. On October 18 it appeared south of the La Bassee Canal, where it\r\nsuffered again from gas attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nUpper Palatinate and part of Lower Bavaria (Third Bavarian district).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe morale of the division was good. On the Fresnoy front in 1917 it\r\nshowed activity and enterprise. It always reacted quickly against\r\nattacks, but it seems that it could easily be persuaded to adopt a more\r\npassive attitude if circumstances were such as to permit it (information\r\nof the British, February, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 6th Bavarian Division was relieved south of the La Bassee Canal\r\nby the 4th Ersatz Division, January 18, and went to rest in the area\r\nsouth of Tournai.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of February it relieved the 187th Division south of\r\nthe Bois Grenier (west of Lille). About the 24th it was relieved by the\r\n10th Ersatz Division, and went back nearer Lille, where it probably\r\nreceived training in open warfare, although this fact has never been\r\ndefinitely established.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n3. For the Somme offensive, the division was sent to the Cambrai front,\r\nentering the line March 20, near Bullecourt, and attacking the following\r\nday. Little progress was made by the Germans on this part of the front,\r\nand the division lost heavily in many attacks. It was withdrawn about\r\nMarch 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIXMUDE.\r\n\r\n4. April 4 it relieved the 214th Division south of Dixmude. A very\r\nelaborate attack against the Belgians was planned to take place here\r\nApril 17, and it was to be made by the 6th Bavarian Division and some\r\nelements of adjoining units. It was presumed that the German successes\r\nat Mount Kemel had shaken the line to the north and that the whole Ypres\r\nsalient could be captured. Preparations were made, and the attack\r\nattempted, but it failed completely, and the Belgians not only threw the\r\nenemy back but took a great many prisoners. It was withdrawn about the\r\n19th and went to rest for a week near Ruddervoorde (south of Bruges),\r\nalthough some of its elements held part of the sector of the 1st\r\nLandwehr Division east of Merckem for a day or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n5. The division was sent to the Verdun region via Brussels-Namur-Sedan-\r\nMontmédy, and went into camp in the vicinity of Chauvency (west of\r\nMontmedy), where it remained 10 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. May 24 it relieved the 22d Division near Beaumont (north of Verdun).\r\n\r\n\r\nROYE.\r\n\r\n7. It was relieved about August 7, and after resting a few days moved up\r\nto the Roye region. It was identified in the Bois des Loges August 16;\r\nit had relieved the 206th Division. The division remained in line\r\nretiring in the face of the Allied advance, but fighting stubbornly,\r\nespecially near Campagne, Montigny, and Essigny le Grand; at the last-\r\nnamed place it counterattacked violently, but in vain, September 29. It\r\nwas still in line when the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Bavarian is rated as one of the 45 best enemy divisions. It\r\nsuffered extremely heavy losses, but since it always fought well—though\r\nnot brilliantly, during 1918—the German High Command sent it as many\r\nreplacements as it could. The morale has always been good, but quite\r\nanti-Prussian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6th.

This division was organized in Bavaria in September, 1914, and sent\r\nto Belgium about October 21. Assembled in the vicinity of Lille and was\r\nsent toward Dadizeele the 27th and was near Gheluvelt October 29, but\r\ndoes not seem to have been in the fight.\r\n\r\n2. November 1 it was sent south of Ypres between Hollebeke and Messines.\r\nIt attacked in the direction of Wytschaete November 2 and suffered heavy\r\nlosses: 11th Company, 4 officers and 181 men (16th Reserve Regiment);\r\n6th company of the 17th Reserve Regiment, 5 officers and 228 men\r\n(casualty lists). November 6 the 3d company of the 21st Reserve Regiment\r\nwas reduced to 3 provisional officers and 63 men (notebook).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Messines-Wytschaete sector until the\r\nbeginning of March, 1915.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved between March 6 and 8 and sent the 11th as reinforcements to\r\nthe 7th Corps at Neuve Chapelle. Then sent to rest in the region of\r\nRoubaix in March.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\n3. Beginning of April it went into line southwest of Lille between\r\nGrenier Wood and Aubers and held this sector until the end of September,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. July 19, 1916, the division suffered heavy losses in opposing the\r\nBritish attack southeast of Laventie.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved from the Lille front about September 27 and engaged in the\r\nSomme district near Eaucourt l’Abbaye and Gueudecourt until October 13.\r\nAgain suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. October 25 it took over the Vimy-Lievin sector, south of Lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the front south of Lens during all the winter of\r\n1916 to 1917 and executed many raids.\r\n\r\n2. February 12 sent to rest near Douai and reorganized in February and\r\nMarch. One of its regiments, the 21st Reserve, was transferred to the\r\n16th Bavarian Division, newly organized.\r\n\r\n3. March 14 it went into line north of the La Bassee Canal.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from this sector at the end of April and was engaged May 8\r\nnortheast of Arras, at Oppy Gavrelle, until May 11. In the middle of\r\nJune it returned to this sector for a few days and does not seem to have\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest near Douai until the end of June the division was sent\r\nto Flanders. Was first placed in reserve south of Thielt during the\r\nfirst few weeks of July and engaged the 18th southeast of Ypres in the\r\nLedeghem sector. Lost heavily from the artillery preparation and was\r\nrelieved July 30 before the British attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n6. Sent to Alsace and held the Altkirch sector from the middle of August\r\nto beginning of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAONNOIS.\r\n\r\n7. About October 16 to 17 it was sent to the region of Lizy, southwest\r\nof Laon. It relieved on the Ailette, east of Anizy le Chateau, about\r\nOctober 25, the remains of the 14th and 52d Divisions, decimated by the\r\nFrench attack of the 23d.\r\n\r\n8. The division was not heavily engaged in the sector of Lizy. It\r\ncontinued to hold it in November and December 1917 and January 1918.\r\nDuring this period it was sent to Vervins for rest and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was organized as an attack unit. From January 24 to\r\nFebruary 19, 1918, it went through a training for the offensive in the\r\nvicinity of Vervins including breaking-through maneuvers, Feb. 1 with a\r\nPrussian division at Vallee aux Bleds; another divisional maneuver\r\nFebruary 11 before the German Crown Prince and Gen. Ludendorff; third\r\ndivisional maneuver February 18 (examination of prisoners, Feb. 28,\r\n1918). It is to be noted that in Flanders, where the division had the\r\nonly important fight it had in 1917 it suffered heavily. Its morale was\r\nso weakened that it had to be withdrawn before the British attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERVINS.\r\n\r\n1. The 6th Bavarian Reserve Division was relieved in the Anizy le\r\nChateau region by the 6th Division, January 24 and went to the vicinity\r\nof Vervins where it was put through a course of training in open\r\nwarfare, in which artillery and aeroplanes participated. These exercises\r\nwere supervised by the Crown Prince and Ludendorff.\r\n\r\n2. February 22 it relieved the 6th Division in its former section. About\r\nthe end of the month the division was relieved by elements of the 13th\r\nLandwehr Division, and by the extension of the flanks of the neighboring\r\ndivisions, going to rest in the Chauny region.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the middle of April the division relieved the 206th Division\r\nnear Mesnil St. Georges (southwest of Montdidier). It was relieved by\r\nthe 25th Reserve Division April 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nAILETTE.\r\n\r\n4. There is some doubt as to where the division went; it was reported\r\nnortheast of Ghent, northeast of Laon, and in Lorraine. There is some\r\nevidence to show that it relieved the 222d Division near Anizy le\r\nChateau during the night of May 2–3. This front was very quiet until the\r\nGerman offensive of May 27, in which attack the 6th Bavarian Reserve\r\nDivision did not attack in the front line—being “leap-frogged” by the\r\n5th and 6th Divisions acting as shock units—but followed up the advance\r\ncoming into line between these two divisions during the night of the\r\n27th–28th. It was at this time definitely identified. In the attack on\r\nTerny (May 28), the division met with strong resistance and suffered\r\nheavily. June 1 it captured Le Port, but lost it again to the French on\r\nJune 7, with severe losses. It was relieved about the 15th by the 53d\r\nReserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n5. July 17 it was identified near Passy sur Marne (west of Dormans). It\r\nwas withdrawn August 6 and spent a fortnight refitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPAUME.\r\n\r\n6. August 23 it reinforced the front near Ervillers (northwest of\r\nBapaume) having traveled via Cambrai, Bourlon, and Beugnâtre. The\r\ndivision was withdrawn early in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n7. It relieved the 8th Division southwest of Messines during the night\r\nof September 17–18. Just before coming into line the 17th Bavarian\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment was dissolved and its men drafted to the other\r\ntwo regiments of the division. It was replaced by the 25th Bavarian\r\nInfantry Regiment from the 14th Bavarian Division which was dissolved at\r\nthis time. Likewise, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Field Artillery Regiment\r\nwas dissolved and replaced by the 19th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment\r\nfrom the 10th Bavarian Division disbanded in July. The division remained\r\nin line until the armistice was signed, withdrawing through Wytschaete-\r\nHouthem-Comines-Marcke-Ooteghem and Krinstraat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Bavarian Reserve is rated as a second-class division, which\r\nseems justified not only from opinions concerning its ability as a\r\nfighting unit coming from Allied sources, but also from the fact that,\r\nalthough it had a course of training in “breaking through” in February,\r\nit was never so used by the German High Command, serving rather as a\r\n“follow up” division. (Cf. May 27 offensive.) The division suffered\r\nheavy losses during its 1918 engagements; indeed, some prisoners\r\ncaptured the middle of September said that it was to be broken up. They\r\nwere mistaken, but one of the infantry regiments and the artillery\r\nregiment were disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6th Bavarian Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │Von      │121 Ldw. │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │1 Bav.\r\n              │  Frech. │         │  Mixed  │  Ldw.   │  Mixed  │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │\r\n              │1 Bav.   │123 Ldw. │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │2 Bav.\r\n              │  Mixed  │         │  Mixed  │  Ldw.   │  Mixed  │  Ldw.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │\r\n              │2 Bav.   │1 Bav.   │         │3 Bav.   │         │3 Bav.\r\n              │  Mixed  │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │2 Bav.   │         │12 Bav.  │         │12 Bav.\r\n              │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.\r\n              │         │3 Bav.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  Ldw.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │12 Bav.  │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  Ldw.   │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │1 Ldw.

The 14th Brigade, which had already obtained reservists July 30,\r\nentrained on the evening of August 2 and was one of the six brigades\r\nordered to take Liege. The whole division moved into the region of Liege\r\nAugust 15. It belonged to the 1st Army (Von Kluck), and passed through\r\nLouvain August 18 and through Brussels the 20th. On the 23d it was on\r\nthe Haine, west of St. Ghislain. On the 24th between Quiévrain and\r\nAudregnies it threatened to envelop the Allied left. Going through Le\r\nCateau and Peronne on August 28, the division passed through Grand Morin\r\nand arrived at Choisy, southeast of Coulommiers, from where it was sent\r\nin all haste to the aid of the right wing of the 1st Army (Etavigny,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n2. After the retreat it went to the north of the Aisne below Soissons\r\nuntil the last days of September (fights at Cuisy en Almont, Morsain,\r\nNouvron, Fontenoy).\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September it was attached to the 6th Army (Crown Prince\r\nof Bavaria) and sent to Artois.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October it fought south of Arras (Monchy aux\r\nBois, Ransart, Wailly). It established itself south of the Scarpe.\r\n\r\n5. It held the sector until the end of May, 1915. During this period it\r\nlimited itself to organizing defensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In March the division was reduced to three regiments by the transfer\r\nof the 66th Infantry to the 52d Division (new).\r\n\r\n2. In May, 1915, at the time of the French offensive in Artois some\r\nunits of the division were sent as reinforcements to the region of\r\nNeuville-St. Vaast. It left some prisoners and suffered heavy losses on\r\nMay 12 to 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. June 12 the division left the sector south of the Scarpe and went\r\ninto line the 13th between Lorette and Angres (from the Souchez-Aix\r\nNoulette Road to the Blanc work). The French offensive struck it June 13\r\nand the days following north of the road from Souchez to Aix Noulette.\r\nIt was forced to give ground and lost many prisoners (250 men, among\r\nthem 6 officers from the 26th Infantry north of Bois Carre; the 2d\r\nBattalion of the 26th Infantry lost 12 officers and 597 men out of\r\naction, according to the Prussian casualty lists).\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of July the division established itself south of the\r\nrailroad from Grenay to Lens, north of Souchez. September 25 it fought\r\nin the third battle of Artois, north of Bois en Hache, before Angres and\r\nLievin. It showed considerable energy, but again had many of its men\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n5. The division remained in this sector southwest of Loos (south of the\r\nLens-Béthune Road; Lene-Grenay Railroad) until July, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Until the beginning of July, 1916, the division had no serious\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\n2. About July 3 the division was relieved from the Loos front. On the\r\n13th it was at Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. July 14 and 15 it began to be engaged in the battle of the Somme\r\nbetween Pozieres and Bazentin le Petit. It suffered terrible losses.\r\nRelieved May 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest in the region of Valenciennes it went into line east of\r\nArras August 9 and stayed there until September 17. At this time it\r\ntransferred its 27th Infantry to the 211th Division and took in exchange\r\nthe 393d Infantry, composed of levies from the regiments of the 7th,\r\n8th, and 12th Divisions, 50th Reserve Division and 38th Landwehr\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. About September 18 it again took part in the battle of the Somme in\r\nthe sector of Courcelette. It fought bravely and again suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. Withdrawn from the Somme about October 2 and went into the sector\r\nsoutheast of Loos October 5. Again withdrawn from this sector November\r\n10 it went almost immediately into the line south of the La Bassee Canal\r\nand stayed there until May 28, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. During the winter of 1916–17 the division had no big battles, but\r\nsuffered from raids executed by the British troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. May 28 it was withdrawn from the La Bassee front and sent to the\r\nregion of Ypres (sector of Hollebeke-Wytschaete) June 8 to 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of July it was sent to Alsace to the vicinity of\r\nMulhouse where it rested.\r\n\r\n4.

Its first units appeared there beginning\r\nAugust 9, 1914, the date of the detraining of the 121st Landwehr at Neuf\r\nBrisach. The 119th Landwehr fought south of Mulhouse beginning August\r\n19, and the 40th Landwehr at Dornach near Mulhouse on the same day.\r\n\r\n2. In October, 1917, the 52d and 55th Brigades, which were to compose in\r\n1915 the 7th Landwehr Division, were part of the Gaede Army Group and\r\noccupied the region of Munster, Guebwiller, Cernay.\r\n\r\n3.

In April\r\nthe 40th Landwehr (Baden) left the division and was transferred for some\r\ntime to the 6th Landwehr Division (Bavarian).\r\n\r\n2. The 7th Landwehr Division then contained the 119th, 121st and 123d\r\nLandwehr, to which a fourth regiment was joined, the 126th Landwehr,\r\nformed by drafts from the three others. The division, from then on\r\nexclusively Wurtemberger, from that time held the sector Wattwiller-\r\nRhone-Rhine Canal (Cernay-Altkirch).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1.

It took over the\r\nKisselin sector (Volhynia).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nFrom April, 1915 on, the division was entirely composed from men from\r\nWurtemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nA mediocre division, much reduced by transferring its most energetic\r\nunits to active regiments and Wurtemberg reserve regiments and receiving\r\nin exchange older men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1918, the 7th Landwehr Division left the Kisselin region\r\nand advanced into the Ukraine. “We are going into Russia to succor the\r\nUkrainians,” wrote a man of the 122d Reserve Regiment from the Rovno\r\nregion on February 26.

After resting near Courtrai for two weeks, the division entrained at\r\nLauwe on August 13 for Armentieres, where it remained until August 23.\r\nIt went into line in the Kemmel area for three days. The division was\r\nthen railed back to Tourcoing, from where it was transferred by trucks\r\nto Lagnicourt on August 26 and came into line on the following day at\r\nEcoust.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS-CAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n3. In two weeks the division was heavily engaged in the Arras battle. It\r\nwas relieved on September 9, after losing more than 700 prisoners. The\r\ndivision rested in the Cambrai area until September 22, when it relieved\r\nthe 1st Guard Reserve Division north of Moeuvres. It was withdrawn on\r\nSeptember 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n4.

With the 7th Division, the 8th Division formed the 4th Army Corps. It\r\ndetrained August 10 to 12 near Dusseldorf and, with that corps, was part\r\nof the 1st Army (Von Kluck). Entered Belgium the 15th, passed through\r\nLouvain the 19th, and through Brussels the 20th, and executed with the\r\n7th Division an enveloping movement on the left of the Allies. Fought at\r\nSolesmes the 26th and arrived east of Coulommiers September 6, from\r\nwhere it was sent in a great hurry to the right of the 1st Army, with\r\nthe 7th Division (Lizy sur Ourcq-Plessis, Placy, etc.). September 8 the\r\n11th Company of the 93d Infantry was reduced to 96 men (notebook).\r\n\r\n2. After the retreat, beginning the 15th, it was engaged against the\r\nleft wing of the British north of Soissons (battle of the Aisne,\r\nCuffies, Chavigny, Pasly, etc.).\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September it went with the 4th Army Corps to Artois\r\nwith the 6th Army.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October it took part in the attacks south of\r\nArras and held the lines near Monchy aux Bois.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Monchy sector during the first few months of\r\n1915. At the end of May it was relieved from this sector and put in the\r\nreserve of the army near Douai after transferring the 36th Fusiliers to\r\nthe 113th Division, newly formed (March).\r\n\r\n2. During the first two weeks of June it went into line in the Souchez\r\nsector and opposed the French attacks. Relieved at the beginning of\r\nSeptember and became army reserve near Tourcoing and Roubaix.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOS.\r\n\r\n3. At the battle of Loos during the counterattack the division suffered\r\nheavy losses in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In 1916 until the battle of the Somme the division did not take part\r\nin any serious engagements. It was established in the Loos sector. July\r\n3 it left this front for the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of July it went into battle on the Pozieres-Longueval-\r\nBois Delville front and suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of July it was relieved and sent to rest in the region\r\nof Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n4. August 9 it took over a quiet sector before Arras and stayed there\r\nabout five weeks.\r\n\r\n5. About September 18 it again went into the battle of the Somme. It\r\nheld the Thiepval-Courcelette sector, where it had some hard fighting,\r\nwhich caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. October 1 it left this sector to again hold the trenches northeast of\r\nLoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. During the winter of 1916–17 the division had no heavy fighting.\r\nHowever, in April, May, and June it had serious losses due to the many\r\nraids executed by the British.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of July and the beginning of August the division\r\nsuffered considerably from artillery fire. It was relieved before the\r\nattack of the British before Lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. August 5 it entrained for Rethel. Rested for some time in the region\r\nof Semide, then held the sector west of Butte du Mesnil from August 15\r\nto September 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n4. About September 18 it was sent in the region of Bouziers and October\r\n4 went into line west of Becelaere (Belgium), and shortly afterwards,\r\nOctober 9, south of Hollebeke. It was still there January 20, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nProvince of Prussian Saxony, Duchy of Anhalt, and part of Thuringia.\r\nSame remarks as for the 7th Division. The fluctuations in the resources\r\nof the region are evidenced by the following facts: On November 4, 1917,\r\na man came to the 5th Company of the 93d Infantry who was born in 1898\r\nin the Eighth District, was a farmer, and had been called up September\r\n3, having had just two months of training. He was sent by a depot in\r\nCologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nSince the battles of 1914 the division remained entirely on the\r\noffensive. It always defended itself well in attacks and held its\r\npositions with tenacity.\r\n\r\nDuring its stay on the Champagne it did not show any activity, but also\r\nit had no desertions. It may be said that its morale is good.\r\n(September, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved by the 17th Reserve Division in the\r\nHollebeke sector about January 31. It rested and trained near Coutrai\r\nduring February and until March 7.\r\n\r\n2. On March 7 it was engaged west of Zandvoorde, where it was in line\r\nuntil April 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n3. The division came into the battle line west of Merville on April 11,\r\nwhich town it captured. About the 23d it passed to the second line.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested for two weeks at Canteleu (a suburb of Lille). It\r\nreturned to a rest camp north of Kemmel about May 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n5. It was engaged south of Ypres from May 15 until the 1st of July in\r\nthe sector, with division headquarters at Halluin.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested near Coutrai during July, from where it returned\r\nto its former sector south of Ypres on July 26 and was in line until the\r\nnight of September 17–18.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE CATELET.\r\n\r\n7. It was moved south to relieve the Alpine Corps at Vendhuile, where it\r\ncame in on September 23. In the fighting the division was driven back by\r\nAubencheul-Villers Cutreaux on Maretz-Clary early in October. After\r\nsuffering heavy casualties and losing over 400 prisoners, it was\r\nwithdrawn on October 14.\r\n\r\n8. The division rested in the Guise area until October 22.\r\n\r\n9. It was reengaged north of Le Cateau on October 22–23, but withdrew\r\nabout November 1. On the 5th it was identified in line north of Maulde,\r\nwhere it remained until the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was regarded as a first-class division. A majority of its\r\nmen came from the younger classes. Its effectives were high and the\r\nmorale good. Apart from the Armentieres offensive in April, the division\r\nwas on the defensive during 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         8th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │56 Ldw.       │109 Ldw.      │56 Ldw.       │109 Ldw.\r\n              │              │110 Ldw.      │              │110 Ldw.\r\n              │              │109 Landst.   │              │109 Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Ldw.

In February, 1916, the 109th Landwehr and the 110th Landwehr, which\r\nhad up to that time remained on the defensive, took part in the attacks\r\nbetween Seppois and Largitzen and against the Scoonholz, northwest of\r\nAltkirch. They executed many raids during 1916.\r\n\r\n2. The 109th Landsturm, which was in line at one end of the front, was\r\nbroken up in May, 1916, and replaced in the division by the 111th\r\nLandwehr, newly formed, consisting in reality of three Landsturm\r\nbattalions already stationed in Alsace, of which two were part of the\r\n109th Landsturm (XIV 23 and XIV 25).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\nAbout January 23, 1917, the division was withdrawn from the Alsace front\r\nand sent to the Cotes de Meuse, where it took over the sector west of\r\nFresnes en Woevre. April 15 the division moved toward the north and held\r\nthe lines to the Etain-Verdun road.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nEntirely from Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was a defense division (May, 1918). Each company had one\r\nshock-troop squad per platoon (prisoners’ statements Dec. 8, 1917).\r\n\r\nLike the 2d and 7th Landwehr Divisions, but to a smaller degree, the 8th\r\nLandwehr Division had some of its men transferred to active units; thus,\r\nin November, 1917, it transferred some men to 121st Division, then near\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\nThe division continued in the Woevre sector during 1918. Through failure\r\nto identify it, it was considered as out of line September 21 and\r\nSeptember 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIt was rated as a fourth-class division. Its losses apart from the St.\r\nMihiel attack were negligible. In the attack it did fairly well, without\r\nheavy loss. The morale was fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    8th.

The 9th Division with the 10th Division, formed the 5th Army Corps\r\n(Posen), and at the beginning of the war was part of the 5th Army\r\n(German Crown Prince). Detrained August 9 to 10 in annexed Lorraine,\r\nnear Bouzonville, and fought August 22 at Virton. After a number of\r\nmarches and countermarches in Woevre, it established itself during the\r\nfirst days of September with the 10th Division in a sector of Cotes de\r\nMeuse (Calonne trench). It remained there about two years from\r\nSeptember, 1914, to September, 1916, with rest billets in the villages\r\nof the Woevre at the foot of the hills (Thillot, Woël, Hannonville,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES EPARGES.\r\n\r\n1. In the spring of 1915 it took part in the battles of Les Eparges\r\nwhere it suffered heavily. In March it transferred its 58th Infantry to\r\nthe 119th Division, newly formed, which was operating in Galicia\r\nbeginning with April.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of September, 1916, the division was withdrawn from\r\nthe sector of Calonne trench and relieved the 14th Bavarian Division in\r\nthe woods of Vaux Chapitre (Verdun). In this last sector it suffered\r\nhuge losses. October 24, 1916, it lost 700 men captured.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved at the beginning of November and reorganized with men of all\r\nages from depots of the Fifth District.\r\n\r\n3. November 4 it entrained behind Douaumont; was sent to the Aisne and\r\nput in the line November 8 in the sector of Nouvron, where it remained\r\nuntil the middle of February, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. Entrained at Laon during the last two weeks of February, 1917, and\r\nsent to Vigneulles, via Charleville-Conflans-Chambley; and again went\r\ninto the sector of Calonne trench between February 18 and the end of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved at the end of April and sent from Mars la Tour-Vigneulles\r\n(via Conflans-Sedan-Liart) to the region of Rozoy sur Serre. After a few\r\ndays’ rest in the vicinity of Sissonne it was engaged beginning May 6 in\r\nthe attacks on the plateaus of Vauclerc and Californie, where some of\r\nits regiments suffered heavy losses, especially on the Winterberg.\r\n\r\n3. Beginning May 18 the division did not attack any more but merely held\r\nthe sector (Californie-Chevreux les Courtines). However, our attack of\r\nMay 22 to 24 caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of May the 9th Division was replaced by the 41st Division.\r\nIt received reinforcements. (The 19th Infantry received 200 men June 14.\r\nAbout May 25, 60 men of the 1918 class were sent to the 6th Company of\r\nthis regiment.) From May 13 to June 13 the 10th Company of the 154th\r\nInfantry received 68 men at least, most of them of the 1918 class.\r\n\r\n5. About June 17–18 the division appeared in the sector of Juvincourt,\r\nwhere it attacked on the night of August 4–5 without success. Relieved\r\nabout September 8 without having losses in this last sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n6. During September it was sent to rest in the region of Pierrepont-\r\nMissy-Liesse. Engaged in the sector of Bovettes-Pargny-Filain from\r\nOctober 23 to 27 and withdrawn from this front at the beginning of\r\nNovember after some of its regiments had suffered heavy losses during\r\nthe battle of October 23 to 25.\r\n\r\n7. About the middle of November the division went to the sector of\r\nChevregny, after a rest of about two weeks in the region of Laon, during\r\nwhich it was filled up again. It held this sector until the beginning of\r\nDecember. December 8 it was in the vicinity of Laon. January 11, 1918,\r\nsome of the units were at Liesse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division (Fifth District) was recruited in Lower Silesia, where the\r\nGerman population is much more numerous than the Polish population.\r\nAlthough it received men from the Second and Third Districts in 1913 and\r\nmen from the Seventh District in 1916, it could without great difficulty\r\nget all its men from its original territory. Its replacements come\r\nalmost entirely from Lower Silesia, and in emergency from Silesia. It is\r\nmore homogeneous than the 10th Division, where the Polish elements have\r\nto be balanced off by Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAmong the various German units which were engaged in front of Verdun and\r\nat Californie Plateau, the 9th Division was one of those which showed\r\nthe least resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on the Chemin des Dames front on December\r\n29 and went to rest and train in the Guise area until the middle of\r\nMarch, when it proceeded to the battle front.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was at Marcyon March 20. On the 21st it followed up the attack\r\nwithout being engaged through Happencourt, Artemps, Tugny, Dury, Pithon,\r\nHam, and Nesle (Mar. 25). It was engaged on the 26th near Roye and\r\nadvanced by Montdidier to west of Mesnil-St. Georges March 27–28. Its\r\nattack of March 30 on Ayencourt-Royancourt met with heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn on April 1 for a short rest, during which\r\nit received a draft of 400 men. It returned to line southwest of\r\nMontdidier and was in line from April 5 to 8.\r\n\r\n4. Until the 18th it was in reserve near La Boissiere and later near\r\nNesle until April 24.\r\n\r\n5. It rested near Hirson and Vervins during May, again receiving drafts\r\nto the number of 300 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n6. On May 20 it marched by night stages to the Aisne front, passing\r\nthrough Froidmont, Verneuil sur Serre, and Bruyeres. On the opening day\r\nit advanced in reserve by Presles, Monampteuil, and Pargny Filain. It\r\nwas engaged on the 28th at Sancy-Vregny and advanced in the first line\r\nsouth of Soissons, Venizel, Missy sur Aisne, Courmelles, Noyant,\r\nChazelle, and Poisy (May 30). Its losses in front of Chazelle were\r\nparticularly heavy. It was relieved on June 8. An official German\r\ndocument gives the division losses between May 28 and June 2 as 96\r\nofficers and 2,830 men.\r\n\r\n7. It rested in the vicinity of Rethel and Novion-Porcien (June 15 to\r\nJuly 7) and reconstituted by drafts. It moved toward the Aisne front on\r\nJuly 10, going into reserve northeast of Rheims for a week. Alerted on\r\nthe 17th it moved to Oulchy le Chateau.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n8. The division was engaged near Hartennes and Varcy from July 20 to\r\nAugust 2. It was driven back on Fismes on that date and relieved the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n9. In August it rested and trained near Vailly and in the vicinity of\r\nLaon. After the 24th it was north of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n10. The division was engaged east of La Pompelle from September 20 to\r\nthe beginning of October. On the 3d it was forced back on Isles\r\nBazancourt, and later to Nanteuil sur Aisne. On October 17 it was\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n11. Two days later it was entrained for Flanders, but at Mons directed\r\ntoward Avesnes and La Capelle.\r\n\r\n12. Its last engagement was north of Guise from October 21 to November\r\n4; then near Novin and Avesnes. 1,800 prisoners were taken on November\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a first-class division. Its performance in\r\n1918 was not of the best, however. It was engaged in the Somme, Aisne,\r\nand Marne actions without winning special credit. Discipline was\r\nreported to be lax, and morale poor at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         9th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │17 Res.  │6 Res.   │17 Res.  │19 Res.  │17 Res.  │6 Res.\r\n              │         │7 Res.   │         │7 Res.   │         │19 Res.\r\n              │         │19 Res.  │         │6 Res.   │         │102\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  (Ldw.).\r\n              │         │5 Res.   │         │5 Res.   │         │5 Res.\r\n              │         │  Jag.   │         │  Jag.   │         │  Jag.\r\n              │         │  Btn.   │         │  Btn.   │         │  Btn.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │98 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │395.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Res.

At the beginning of the war it belonged to the 5th German Army\r\n(Imperial Crown Prince). Concentrated in the region of Sarrebruck and\r\ncrossed the southern part of Belgian Luxemburg; fought August 22 near\r\nVille en Montois and September 1 in the region of Consenvoye-Flabas, and\r\nwas kept east of the Meuse near Sivry September 2. Toward the end of\r\nSeptember and the beginning of October the division sent a few units to\r\nthe left bank of the Meuse (Forges-Malancourt-Chattancourt). The\r\ndivision established itself in Woevre during the last two weeks of\r\nOctober and at the beginning of November in the region Etraye-Wavrille-\r\nRomagne, where it did some fighting at Maucourt November 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. About November 13 the division was sent from the region of Verdun to\r\nFlanders. Some units of the division fought near Poelcappelle and south\r\nof Bixschoote in support of the 3d Reserve Corps. It suffered very heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n3. Again sent to Woevre during the month of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1915, the division held the region Gincrey-Etrain-Warcq.\r\nIt remained in this section during the whole of 1915 and until the end\r\nof February, 1916. In April it transferred its 7th Reserve Infantry to\r\nform the 121st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. A few days before the Verdun offensive (end of February, 1916,) the\r\nregiments of the division were relieved. The 6th Reserve and the 19th\r\nReserve organized with their best units one attack battalion each. These\r\nbattalions took part with the 15th Army Corps in the violent action at\r\nthe beginning and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n2. March 7 its units were reorganized behind the front and the division\r\nadvanced through Maucourt-Ornes and established itself north of Vaux.\r\nMarch 9 and 10 the three regiments of the division attacked successfully\r\nthe village and fort of Vaux. They were repulsed nearly everywhere with\r\nvery heavy losses.\r\n\r\n3. About March 12 the division was relieved from before Vaux and sent to\r\nrest in the region of Senon-Amel.\r\n\r\n4. Went back into line about March 20 south of Damploup. It did not\r\nattack any more, but bombardments caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved about the end of April and sent to rest in the vicinity of\r\nSaverne (Alsace) until June 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. About June 20 it went into line in Champagne (sector of Souain-\r\nTahure) but did not take part in any important action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. Withdrawn from the front about September 20 or 25 and sent to the\r\nSomme. Engaged between the eastern limit of Bouchavesnes and the main\r\nPéronne road until October 18. It had a few losses.\r\n\r\n8. After a period of rest, probably in the vicinity of Vouziers, it was\r\nagain sent to the Somme, first behind the front southeast of Bapaume\r\nDecember 1, then about December 17 in line in the sector of Bouchavenes-\r\nBois de St. Pierre-Vaast until February, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1917, the division held on the Somme the sector north of\r\nthe Ancre—south of Achiet le Petit.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the front about March 10 and sent to rest in the\r\nregion of Cambrai, and was established on a new front about March 20\r\nwest of Catelet near Gouzeaucourt, Villers Guislain.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. About April 15 it was relieved and went into line south of the\r\nScarpe, northeast of Monchy le Preaux, from the beginning of May till\r\nthe beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4.

Detrained August 10 and 11 near Sarrelouis and belonged to the\r\n5th Army (Prussian Crown Prince). Entered Luxemburg the 18th, passed\r\nthrough Arlon the 20th, and left it on the evening of the 21st.\r\n\r\n1. Took part in the combat of August 22, 1914 at Ethe, near Virton, next\r\nto the 9th Division. August 28 it was north of Thionville, expecting to\r\nleave for Russia. August 30 it continued its march in the Woevre,\r\nreached the Cotes de Meuse, and attacked the fort of Troyon September 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES EPARGES.\r\n\r\n2. After the battle of the Marne it held the sector of the Cotes de\r\nMeuse east of Verdun (Les Eparges-Callone) which it held almost all the\r\ntime until October 1916. Took part in the series of combats which took\r\nplace in this sector between April and July, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. At the time of our offensive of September and October, 1915, in\r\nChampagne, the 10th Division sent some of its units there, but they\r\nreturned to Woevre about December 10, 1915, after four weeks’ rest in\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n2. After this and until the beginning of October, 1916, the Division\r\nheld its sector of the Cotes de Meuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. In October 1916 the division was relieved and took over the sector of\r\nDouaumon in November. It suffered heavy losses December 15, when the\r\nFrench defeated it severely, and had to be withdrawn from the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. Reorganized at the beginning of January, 1917, after a three weeks’\r\nrest in the region of Mars la Tour, and took over again its former\r\nsector of the Cotes de Meuse at the beginning of March, remaining there\r\nuntil the end of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. Entrained May 1 at Mars la Tour and sent via Conflans-Montmedy-Sedan-\r\nCharleville-Hirson to the region north of the Aisne, where it took over\r\na sector northwest of Braye en Laonnois. It made an attack there May 18\r\nbut did not lose very heavily.\r\n\r\n3. On June 20 it was relieved and sent to rest near Crecy sur Serre.\r\nLeft this region about July 25 and spent six days at Gizy and vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n4. On July 30 it went into line in the sector from Ailles to Hurtebise.\r\nIts regiment suffered a great deal from our artillery fire. During the\r\nattack of August 31 to September 1 the division suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. About September 15 the division was relieved. On the 20th it took\r\nover the sector of St. Gobain.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of the French attack at the end of October an\r\nemergency call was sent the 23d for some of the units of the division\r\nwhich were at rest in the region of Crepy en Laonnois and during the\r\nnight of the 23d–24th they went into line to cover the retreat of the\r\ndivisions in line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST OF ST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the division remained in line in the forest of St.\r\nGobain during this attack. The division was relieved about the middle of\r\nDecember; and on December 15 it was behind the St. Quentin front. At the\r\nend of January 18 the division relieved the 211th division in the sector\r\nof Ailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 10th Division differs from the 9th in that its normal recruiting\r\ndistrict (Province of Posen) is composed mostly of Poles. There are,\r\ntherefore, a large number of Poles in its ranks, but it is evident that\r\nthey are trying to mix them with Prussians, who are less liable to\r\ndesert. The 47th Infantry on December 15, 1916, before Verdun contained\r\nmen from the ninth and tenth districts. The 398th Infantry, whose\r\ncompanies were taken from various divisions, for example the 9th, the\r\n10th and the 103d, obtained from the 103d Division Hessian and\r\nThuringian units. There is the same variety in the 6th Grenadiers, which\r\ncontained at the end of 1912 besides the original drafts from the\r\ndistrict, men from the ninth and tenth districts, as well as from the\r\neighteenth district, the latter belonging to the trained Landsturm (2d\r\nBav.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nUntil the attack of Verdun, the 10th division always had the reputation\r\nof being a good division composed of good units. At the time of the\r\nattack of the French December 10, 1915, however, the division which was\r\nin the sector north of Verdun did not seem to defend itself as\r\nstubbornly as might be expected. It should, however, be noted that 15\r\nper cent of the forces were at that time weakened by sickness. During\r\nthe German attack of May 18, 1917, the 47th Infantry clearly gave the\r\nimpression that it was quite inferior to the two other regiments of the\r\ndivision. (The presence of Poles in the 47th should be noted.) August\r\n31, 1917 at the Chemin des Dames, the units of the 10th division\r\nresisted well and counterattacked with vigor September 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Ailles on February 20 and went to\r\nrest and train for a month. It was at Montcornet, later near Saint\r\nRichaumont, Voulpaix, and La Vallee-aux-Bleds. It marched toward the St.\r\nQuentin front on March 20, by Origny-St. Benoite and Itancourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was in the second line on March 21 and 22, advancing through\r\nUrvillers and Essigny. It was engaged March 23 to 25, crossing the\r\nCrozat Canal to the west of Jussy, Cugny, and Guiscard. It rested on the\r\n25th and 26th. The division was reengaged on March 27 to the 30th in the\r\nvicinity of Libermont, Ognolles, Beuvraignes (27th) Conchy les Pots\r\n(28th–31st). The losses were heavy on the 27th and 28th. The division\r\npassed into the second line on the 31st and then to reserve at Solente\r\n(east of Roye) until the 30th of April.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested and trained from May 5 to 20 at Jeantes la Ville\r\nand Nampcelle la Cour (east of Vervins). It received a draft of 800 men\r\non May 18.\r\n\r\n4. The division marched toward the Aisne front through Montigny le\r\nFranc, Marchais, Montaigu, and Mauregny, May 25 and 26, by night.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n5. It attacked on the Chemin des Dames on May 27, near Ailles, its\r\nformer sector. It was in the front line of the advance through Paissy,\r\nOeuilly, Barbonval, Blanzy, Bazoches (27th), Mareuil en Dole, (28th),\r\nsouth of Fere en Tardenois, (29th), south of Beuvardes (30th), south of\r\nBouresches. It retired from the front about June 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division was at rest near Sissonne after the middle of June to\r\nJuly 7. It marched to the front via Eppes, Brenelle, Foret de Fere, July\r\n7 to 11. It crossed the Marne on the morning of the 15th, by pontoons,\r\nhaving passed through the sector of the 10th Ldw. Div. The division’s\r\nobjective was a line 8 klms. south of the river, which was to have been\r\nreached by 11 a. m. The advance was completely checked by the American\r\nDivision (3d) south of the Marne. The division lost 400 prisoners and\r\nmany casualties.\r\n\r\n7. The division was taken out within a few days and rested at Arcy-St.\r\nRestitute. It was engaged near Vierzy on the 26th and was thrown back on\r\nthe Vesle by August 1, when it was relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOEVRE.\r\n\r\n8. The division was taken to Athies-sous-Laon, where it entrained on\r\nAugust 5 for Mars-la-Tour. The itinerary included Hirson, Charleville,\r\nSedan. It camped at Sponville until the night of August 18–19. It\r\nrelieved the 277th Division in the sector Richecourt, Lahayville, St.\r\nBaussant. The division had absorbed the 255th Division, dissolved on\r\nAugust 7, and its losses in men and material had been made up. The\r\ndivision sustained the American attack of September 12 and was thrown\r\nback north of Thiaucourt on Jaulny, Rembercourt. The division lost\r\nheavily in casualties and prisoners. Practically the entire 3d Battalion\r\nof the 398th Regiment was captured on the first day. It was taken out on\r\nSeptember 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSELLE.\r\n\r\n9. The division was reassembled at Loringen, near Metz. From the\r\ndissolved 77th Reserve Division the 257th Reserve Regiment was turned\r\ninto the 6th Gren. Regiment (10th Division), the 419th into the 398th\r\nRegiment, and the 332d into the 47th Regiment. Other drafts from Germany\r\nwere received to reconstitute the division. On the 5th of October the\r\ndivision entered the sector east of the Moselle (Nomeny), where it\r\nremained until October 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n10. The division returned to Metz and moved by rail for Pelte, via Metz-\r\nLonguyon-Montmedy. It went into position on November 3 northwest of\r\nStenay. The last identification was on the Meuse on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a first-class division. It behaved creditably\r\nin the Somme and Aisne offensives. It was completely defeated on the\r\nMarne, from which it never recovered. The inferior qualities of the\r\ndrafts received in August and September lowered the fighting value of\r\nthe division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         10th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │18 Res.  │37 Res.  │19 Res.  │37 Res.  │19 Res.  │37 Res.\r\n              │         │46 Res.  │         │46 Res.  │         │98 Res.\r\n              │77.      │37 Fus.  │         │98 Res.  │77.      │37 Fus.\r\n              │         │155.     │77.      │37 Fus.  │         │155.\r\n              │         │         │         │155.     │         │\r\n              │         │         │   (37 Res.

About February 15, 1916, the division was relieved from the sector on\r\nthe right bank of the Meuse and put in reserve. During the first days of\r\nthe offensive it engaged only a few attack battalions. Beginning March\r\n12 it was in line before Vaux and Fort Vaux and had very heavy losses.\r\nApril 3 the 8th of the 37th Fusiliers received at least 64 replacements\r\n(recuperated men who entered the service the preceding November and\r\nrecovered wounded and sick).\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved at the end of April and sent to rest in the\r\nregion of Mulhouse from the beginning of May to June 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to Champagne and held the sector north of Tahure, south of Somme\r\nPy, until September 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. After a few days rest it was sent to the Somme south of the St.\r\nPierre Wood-Vaast from October 5 to 15. It suffered very heavy losses\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n5. At rest for 13 days, then entrained, and went to Dun via Hirson-\r\nMézières-Charleville-Sedan October 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORT HOMME.\r\n\r\n6. It held the sector of Mort Homme (left bank of the Meuse) from\r\nOctober 28 to February 8, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division was at rest in the middle of February, 1917, in the\r\nregion of Sedan, then of Dizy le Gros.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of March it went into line in the region of Berry au\r\nBac (from Hill 108 to Spigneul). It was relieved at the beginning of the\r\nFrench attack April 16. The French artillery preparation caused it heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORT HOMME-HILL 304.\r\n\r\n3. From April 24 to May 15 it was in line in its old sector—Cumierès-\r\nMort Homme—and from the middle of May till July 19 in the adjoining\r\nsector—Hill 304-Avocourt Wood. It attacked June 28 and 29 and opposed\r\nour counterattacks of July 12 to 17, suffering heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the front about July 19.\r\n\r\n5. At rest near Sedan and reorganized (replacements from the Fifth\r\nDistrict and Eighteenth District (Frankfort on Main)).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. It then took over the sector Vitry-Cernay les Reims about August 8.\r\nRemained there until about October 27.\r\n\r\n7. November 9 it went into line north of Craonne in the region of\r\nChermizy-Bouconville (?). Some of the units of the division were not in\r\nthis sector. After a rest in the camp of Sissonne and at Poilcourt, end\r\nof October to middle of December, they went into line in the sector\r\nMiette-Aisne about December 17. About that date the division was\r\nregrouped north of Berry au Bac, where it was still in February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nProvince of Posen. The differences were made up by the Sixth District\r\nmostly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is considered as a “big attack” division. In April, 1917,\r\nin the region of Berry au Bac it executed a well-conducted attack on\r\nSatigneul. The offensive value of the division showed itself again\r\nduring the attacks of June 28–29 of 1917 at Hill 304.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of volunteers for dangerous missions, and the motto of\r\nthe division is said to be: “Get after the enemy and beat ’em wherever\r\nyou find ’em.” The commanding general of the division and the colonel\r\ncommanding the 155th consider that their men are able to endure hard\r\nbattles (November, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved about March 15 and sent to reenforce the\r\nSomme front. It was engaged near Beaulieu les Fontaines on March 25–26,\r\nwhere it remained until April 7. Heavy casualties were reported in this\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested until May 27, when it took part in the offensive\r\nat Mont Notre Dame. About June 15 it was withdrawn to Athies (Laon),\r\nwhere it rested fallen until July 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n3. On July 15 the division was again engaged south of the Marne at\r\nMontvoisin and Oeuilly on the opening day. It retired from the Vesle\r\nfront, to which it had fallen back, about August 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE.\r\n\r\n4. After resting three weeks at Asfeld the division returned to the\r\nVesle front on August 28 near Chalon sur Vesle and was engaged until\r\nSeptember 18.\r\n\r\n5. On the 18th the division was directed by stages to Laon and entered\r\nthe line south of Laon at Ferme-Colombe on the 22d. The division appears\r\nto have been constantly in action until November 1, and possibly until\r\nthe armistice. It was successively identified at Chevrigny, Montceau le\r\nWaast (Oct. 14), southeast of Toulle (Oct. 27), south of Banogne (Nov.\r\n1). The last identification was at Maubert-Fontaine on November 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a first-class division. It fought hard in most\r\nof the offensives of the year, and when on the defensive put up a hard,\r\nsteady fight for two months without relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         10th Ersatz Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │37 Ers.  │37, 38,  │37 Ers.  │37, 38,  │25 Mixed │369.\r\n              │         │  39, and│         │  39, and│  Ers.   │\r\n              │         │  40     │         │  40     │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n              │25 Ers.  │25, 26,  │25 Ers.  │25, 26,  │         │368.\r\n              │         │  27, 28,│         │  27, 28,│         │\r\n              │         │  and 79 │         │  and 79 │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n              │43 Ers.  │43, 44,  │43 Ers.  │43, 44,  │43 Mixed │370.\r\n              │         │  76, and│         │  76, and│  Ers.   │\r\n              │         │  83     │         │  83     │         │\r\n              │         │  Brig.  │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.  │         │  Btns.  │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │371.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │Ers.

September 28 it entrained for Novéant and went into line on the Haye\r\nfront, where it held various sectors (Loupmont, Richecourt, Apremont).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n1. During 1915 the division continued to hold the Lorraine front (Haye):\r\nLoupmont, Seicheprey, Lahayville, Mort Mare Wood.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of July the division was reorganized. Its brigade Ersatz\r\nbattalions were grouped into regiments and formed the 368th, 369th,\r\n370th, and 371st Infantry. The companies were filled up again. The 9th\r\ncompany of the 370th Infantry received not less than 76 replacements in\r\nAugust (1915 class called up in May).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Flirey-Limey sector until the end of\r\nAugust, 1916. At that date it was relieved by the Guard Ersatz Division\r\nand sent to rest in the region of Thiaucourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. By September 5, leaving the 368th Regiment, which was transferred to\r\nthe 213th Division, it entrained at Montmédy and went to the south of\r\nthe Somme via Laon, Tergnier, and St. Quentin. It fought south of Berny\r\nen Santerre from September 14 to 25 and suffered considerable losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. After a short rest in the region of St. Quentin the division was sent\r\nto Champagne. Until November 12 it held, without any particular\r\nincidents, the Ste. Marie à Py and Somme Py sector.\r\n\r\n4. From the middle of November to the middle of December it was sent to\r\nrest in the region of Attigny.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. December 28 it took over the Ornes-Bezonvaux sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Held the Verdun front (Bezonvaux) until April 19, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Between April 20 and 25 it returned to Champagne and took part in the\r\nattack south of Moronvilliers from the beginning of May to the beginning\r\nof June. From June 9 to beginning of August it was in line in the region\r\nof Regniéville-Remenauville (Haye).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest behind the Lorraine front, the division entrained at\r\nChambley August 21 for Belgium. About September 24 it was engaged before\r\nYpres near Poelcappelle.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from the Belgium front about October 7 and entrained the\r\n10th for Galicia, where it was identified south of Skala, November 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nWestphalia and Rhine Provinces: 369th and 370th Infantry. Thuringia:\r\n371st Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division suffered heavy losses in Champagne in May, 1917, and at\r\nYpres in September and October, 1917. The division has only moderate\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line until the attack on the Lys in April.\r\nIt was engaged north of the La Bassee Canal (Givenchy, Festubert,\r\nsoutheast of Lacre), from April 9 to 24. The losses were heavy,\r\nincluding 700 prisoners. The 360th Regiment suffered the most in the\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n2. It was relieved on the 12th and rested in rear of the line until the\r\n29th, when it returned to its former sector at Locre until May 3.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested near Roubaix (Bondues, Wambrechies) until the\r\nbeginning of July. According to reports, sickness was very general\r\nthroughout the division at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE CANAL.\r\n\r\n4. On July 14 the division entered the line south of the La Bassee\r\nCanal, coming via Lille and Seclin. It remained in this sector until\r\nOctober 2.\r\n\r\n5. It moved southward to reenforce the Cambrai-St. Quentin battle front\r\non October 7, coming into line east of Tilloy. It fell back toward\r\nValenciennes through Escaudoevres, Iwny (Oct. 11), Verchain (Oct. 21),\r\nMaing (Oct. 24–25), Famars (Oct. 27), north of Le Quesnoy (Oct. 27). It\r\nretired to the second line about November 1, but was reengaged southeast\r\nof Antoingt on November 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe 10th Ersatz Division was rated as a third-class division. Its\r\nservice in 1918 was as a sector-holding division. It appears to have\r\nbeen a division of average value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        10th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │              │1 E.          │(?)           │372.\r\n              │              │  Konigsberg  │              │\r\n              │              │  (377).      │              │\r\n              │              │3 E.          │              │373.\r\n              │              │  Konigsberg  │              │\r\n              │              │  (378).      │              │\r\n              │9 Ldw.        │24 Ldw.       │180.          │377.\r\n              │              │48 Ldw.       │              │378.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │91 Ldw.

It found at Koenigsburg\r\nsome of the mobile depot battalions of the regiments of the 1st Army\r\nCorps, from which came the three Koenigsburg Ersatz infantry regiments,\r\nwhich became, respectively, the 376th, 377th, and 378th Infantry. The\r\npresent 372d Infantry is the former Ersatz infantry regiment of the 10th\r\nLandwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. These troops, at first fighting in eastern Prussia, took part in the\r\ncampaign in Poland with the 1st Landwehr Corps, beginning with the first\r\npart of 1915.\r\n\r\n2. About the end of July, 1915, the division took part in the offensive\r\nagainst the Russians, forced the passage of the Narew, and advanced east\r\nof Vilna to the region of Vileiki in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE NAROTCH.\r\n\r\n3. After the front was stabilized it established itself between Spiagla\r\nand Lake Svir, south of Lake Narotch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line near Lake Svir until July, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n2. About July 27 the units of the division were relieved from the front\r\nof Lake Narotch and sent to Volhynia to the Von Linsingen Army. The 9th\r\nLandwehr Brigade became independent and did not follow the division,\r\nwhich was reduced to three regiments. These were engaged on the banks of\r\nthe Stokhod at the end of July at Lokatchi and Kachovka and remained in\r\nline in the region of Kisselin and Sviniouki until the beginning of\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. January to December, 1917, in the Kisselin-Sviniouki sector.\r\n\r\n2. In November, 1917, the three regiments of the division furnished 60\r\nmen per company for the Western Front, picked from the strongest, and\r\nreceived in exchange older men. In October, 16 men per company had\r\nalready been transferred to the 14th Division following the latter’s\r\nlosses on the Aisne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is sufficiently homogeneous, the regiments as a rule coming\r\nfrom eastern Prussia. However, the necessity of filling up the ranks\r\nbefore being sent to France brought it a number of men from other\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its drafts, which are good, and the large number of\r\nofficers, many of whom are in the active army, the division remained on\r\nthe Eastern Front until March, 1918. Up to the present time it has\r\nreceived no training with a view to warfare on the Western Front, and\r\nmust be considered for the time being as of mediocre value (April,\r\n1918). The men of more than 35 years of age were left in Russia as\r\nabrüstungs kommando (cleaning up and salvage).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n1. On June 3 the division entrained in the Woevre and traveled via\r\nConflans-Sedan-Mezieres-Laon to Malmaison, where it detrained on June 4.\r\nIt marched to the front via Fismes, Fere en Tardenois, and Fresnes. It\r\ncame into line on the Marne near Mont St. Pere about June 10. Here it\r\nwas in line until July 15, when it dropped back to permit an attacking\r\ndivision to pass through. In the retreat the division again came into\r\nline a few days later and was heavily engaged on the defense until about\r\nAugust 1.\r\n\r\n2. Heavy losses, including 300 prisoners on July 23, led to the\r\ndissolution of the division. Its effectives were turned into other fresh\r\ndivisions. The 372d, 377th, and 378th went to the 37th Division, 36th\r\nDivision, and 201st Division in the order named.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a fourth-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        10th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │20 Bav.       │16 Bav.       │20 Bav.       │16 Bav.\r\n              │              │6 Bav.

Its three\r\ninfantry regiments were drawn from already existing Bavarian\r\ndivisions—the 16th Bavarian from the 1st Bavarian Division, the 6th\r\nReserve Bavarian from the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, and the 8th\r\nBavarian Reserves from the 4th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the division was in the region of Tournai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. In May it took over the sector of Lihons-Estrees road to Foucaucourt,\r\nwhich it occupied until the Franco-British offensive of 1916.\r\n\r\n3. In October some units of the division were sent as reinforcements to\r\nNeuville-St. Vaast and to Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Remained in the Foucaucourt-Lihons sector until the middle of June,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of June it was sent south of Bapaume and took part in the\r\nbattle of the Somme near Contalmaison, Bazentin le Petit, and Longueval\r\nfrom July 1 to the end of July. The 6th Reserve Infantry suffered\r\nheavily. Its 2d Battalion lost 11 officers and 724 men (casualty lists).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. About the middle of August the division was sent to the Eastern Front\r\n(Stanislau) and the trip lasted from August 13 to 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUKOVINA.\r\n\r\n4. September and October: Bukovina (Dorna-Vatra, Kirlibaba, west of Mont\r\nCapoul). It fought against the right wing of the Roumanian Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n5. From November, 1916, to the end of January, 1917, it held the sector\r\nof Tolgyes in Transylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1917, the division left the Roumanian\r\nfront and went to Galicia (sector of Zalosce) from February to May,\r\nbeing attached to the 2d Austro-Hungarian Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. In May the division returned to France, via Zloczow (May 19),\r\nLemberg, Cracow, Breslau, Frankfort on Main, Treves.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\nDetrained about May 25 in the region of Mulhouse; then was sent to rest\r\nand training in Upper Alsace at the beginning of June and sent to\r\nBelgium (June 12 to 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Fought south of the Ypres-Comines canal where it opposed the attack\r\nof July 31. It then went to the region of Catelet (sector of Gonnelieu)\r\nfrom August 12 to the end of September. It was near Becelaere in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of October it was again sent to the Eastern Front. After a\r\nfew weeks’ rest at Brest Litovsk it returned to France without having\r\nfought. Entrained November 22 at Brest Litovsk and detrained in Lorraine\r\nthe 27th. Itinerary: Warsaw-Posen-Erfurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. On November 29 to 30 it went into line in the forest of Bezange and\r\nwas relieved in the middle of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Infantry: Lower Bavaria. The two other regiments: Bavarian\r\nPalatinate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the division is composed of young men. It does not\r\nseem to have suffered any losses for a long time. However, its morale\r\nseems to have been shaken at times. When it was sent from St. Quentin to\r\nYpres at the end of September, 1917, it is believed that the officers of\r\nthe 16th Infantry had trouble in preventing a mutiny. (British\r\nInformation Bulletin, Oct. 12, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Vosges on May 13 and rested near\r\nDieuze until May 30. It entrained and moved by Metz and Sedan,\r\nCharleville, Liart, and detrained near Laon on the 30th–31st. It moved\r\nto the front by Bruyeres, Braye en Laennois, Mont Notre-Dame, Neuilly-\r\nSt. Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE AND MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. It was reengaged southeast of Troësnes-Passy en Valois (on the Ourcq)\r\nfrom June 5 to July 18. It was thrown back on Rozet St. Albin (July 20)\r\nand then west of Armentieres (21st). About that date the division was\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nThe division was dissolved in August and its units sent to the 6th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division, 11th Bavarian Division, and 14th Bavarian\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a second-class division. In 1918 it saw but\r\nsix weeks of active fighting before it was dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             11th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │21.      │10 Gren. │21.      │10 Gren. │21.      │10 Gren.\r\n              │         │38 Fus.  │         │38 Fus.  │         │38 Fus.\r\n              │22.      │11 Gren. │22.      │11 Gren. │22.      │11 Gren.\r\n              │         │51.      │         │51.      │         │51.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Uhlan Rgt.       │1 and 4 Sqns., 2   │\r\n              │                   │  Uhlan Rgt.       │\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │11 Brig.:          │11 Brig.:          │11 Brig.:\r\n              │ 6 F.

The 11th Division belonged to the 6th Army Corps and detrained at\r\nMerzig August 10 and 11, 1914, passed through Luxemburg the 17th, and\r\nentered Belgian Luxemburg the 18th.\r\n\r\n2. It belonged to the 5th Army (Prussian Crown Prince) and took part in\r\nthe battle of August 22 at Tintigny, St. Vincent, and Belle Fontaine. It\r\ncrossed the Meuse the 29th below Stenay, passed through Varennes and\r\nSte. Menehould. September 7, at the high point of the German advance, it\r\nwas near Revigny.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n3. After the battle of the Marne it established itself at the western\r\nedge of the Argonne (from Binarville to Cernay en Bormois).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n4. October 4 it fought at Binarville. October 21 the 22d Brigade was at\r\nBeine, east of Rheims. The 21st Brigade remained in the Argonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1915, the 21st Brigade returned to the Rheims\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\nIn February the 22d Brigade was attached temporarily in support of the\r\n8th Reserve Corps on the Champagne front (east).\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of June the division went to Artois to reinforce the\r\n6th Army in preparation for the French offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUCHEZ.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of June it held the sector north of Souchez, east of\r\nNeuville St. Vaast. It executed many unsuccessful attacks on Souchez and\r\nthe Chateau of Carleul. It suffered considerable losses during July.\r\nSeptember 25 and 26 it had more losses before La Folie. Relieved at the\r\nend of September and sent to rest in the region of Cambrai. The casualty\r\nlists for the 10th Grenadiers show 432 killed, 1,023 wounded, 64\r\nmissing; total, 1,519 men. The losses were hastily made good from\r\nOctober 5 to 14 by replacements with less than three months’ training\r\n(oldest class Landsturm 2d Band and 1915 class men who entered service\r\nin July). The 9th Company of the 10th Grenadiers received in this way at\r\nleast 119 men and the 12th Company of the 38th Fusiliers about the same.\r\n\r\n4. During the first two weeks of October the division went into line in\r\nthe sector astride the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRISE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1916, the division took part in the attack\r\nwhich ended in the taking of the village of Frise and suffered very\r\nheavy losses.\r\n\r\n2. On May 25 it was relieved, and a short time afterwards took over the\r\nsector south of the Amiens-St. Quentin road. (At the end of June the\r\nfirst 1917-class soldiers arrived with older classes put back, taken\r\nfrom the mines and factories of Silesia.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. In this sector it opposed the French attack of July 1 and days\r\nfollowing. It suffered heavily and lost a large number of prisoners to\r\nthe French. (The 11th Grenadiers, whose battalions had fought in three\r\ndifferent places, separated from the rest of the division, had to have\r\nat least 181 replacements to complete the 11th Company. They arrived\r\nfrom July 6 to 20.)\r\n\r\n4. It was withdrawn from this sector about the end of July and sent to\r\nthe region of St. Quentin to be reorganized.\r\n\r\n5. On August 1 the division took over the trenches in the sector\r\nAndechy-Beuvraignes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n6. September 4 it again went in to the battle of the Somme between\r\nDeniecourt and Vermandovillers. During these two actions in the Somme it\r\nsuffered 83 per cent losses.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved October 10 and took over the sector of Prunay the 24th,\r\nwhich it held until December 12, then went to rest near St. Quentin. The\r\n11th Grenadiers left the division in October and were transferred to the\r\n101st Division in Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. On January 4, 1917, the division went into line in the sector of\r\nLassigny, then on February 10 in the sector of Ablaincourt, south of the\r\nSomme.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of the month of March the division retreated, with\r\nthe other German forces engaged in the Somme, to the Hindenburg line.\r\n\r\n3. March 29 it was sent to the Arras front.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\nApril 19 it opposed south of the Scarpe the first shock of the British\r\nattack. In spite of a desperate defense it was routed and lost 2,200\r\nprisoners to the British. The 51st Infantry was reduced to 600 men\r\n(prisoners’ statements) and its 12th Company to 6 men.\r\n\r\n4. On April 11 the division was relieved and reorganized in the region\r\nof Bruges. It received replacements especially from the 623d Infantry,\r\nwhich was dissolved, organized, and trained at the camp at Neuhammer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of June it was in support of the Wytschaete-Messines\r\nfront when the British attacked. It then held this sector until June 26\r\nand suffered heavy losses again (June 8 and 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n6. After a few days’ rest it was sent to Metz and then put in line in\r\nthe sector of Flirey (in Haye), end of July to September 15.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved about the middle of September, and in October took over a\r\nsector on the Champagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n8. At the end of October it was sent to Flanders and went into line near\r\nPasschendeale. Withdrawn at the end of December and went to the rear of\r\nthe front in the region of Maubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was recruited in the regions of Breslau, Glatz, and\r\nSchweidnitz from a German population. The Poles, therefore, coming from\r\nthe Province of Silesia, are in the minority. The Sixth District is\r\nthickly populated and was able by itself to maintain the division even\r\nduring the period of heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the heavy losses suffered at the Somme, Arras, and\r\nWytschaete the division always fought well. Its value is diminished by\r\nthe presence of a certain number of Poles who were generally ready to\r\ndesert when they had a chance. Lieut. Col. Schwerck, commanding the 51st\r\nInfantry, received the order “Pour le Merite” after the battle of Arras.\r\nThis reward, which has been given to only six other regimental\r\ncommanders, seems to prove that the fighting value of the 11th Division\r\nat Arras in April, 1917, was greatly appreciated by the German High\r\nCommand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 11th Division rested first in the Maubeuge region, and later near\r\nCharleville and Laon for about two months. About March 1 it relieved the\r\n51st Reserve Division in the Butte de Mesnil. Here nothing except minor\r\ntrench raids was attempted. Most of the older men were exchanged for\r\nyoung ones. It was relieved by the 88th Division April 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n2. April 20 it relieved elements of the 34th and 37th Divisions south of\r\nDives, (east of Lassigny). It was relieved by the 202d Division during\r\nthe night of May 22–23. It rested then for about 10 days in the Guiscard\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n3. June 9 it reinforced the Montdidier-Noyon battle front south of\r\nThiescourt (west of Noyon). It attacked the first day of the offensive\r\nas an attack division. It attacked on a front of 1,500 yards, with\r\nCompiegne as its final objective (its orders were captured), but did\r\npoorly, succeeding only in reaching Machemont—less than half way. In\r\nthis engagement it suffered heavy losses. It was withdrawn the 16th and\r\nwent to rest in the Guiscard region, where it received some 1,300\r\nreplacements.\r\n\r\n4. The division relieved the 222d Division near Rubescourt (south of\r\nMontdidier) July 19. In the fighting which followed, the division lost\r\nheavily. The 10th Regiment received 300 replacements August 2; relieved\r\nabout the 12th.\r\n\r\n5. It reentered line near Varesnes the 22d and was withdrawn the 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n6. September 8 it came back into line southwest of St. Quentin near\r\nJussy. It was withdrawn about the 20th.\r\n\r\n7. Four days later the division was identified north of St. Quentin in\r\nthe Gricourt sector; withdrawn the 2d of October.\r\n\r\n8. It came back into line about the 12th near Barisis (south of LaFere).\r\nThe division took part in the general German retirement and was\r\nidentified successively at Remies, Mesbrecourt, Léa Ferte-Chevresis,\r\nMonceau le Neuf, Le Herie la Vieville, St. Algis, and Champ Bouvier. It\r\nwas still in line when the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 11th is rated as a good second-class division. It did not do well in\r\nthe battle of the Oise, but everywhere else its conduct under fire was\r\ncharacterized by considerable tenacity. Losses were very heavy. Numerous\r\ncases of desertion, especially to the interior; a large number of\r\nreplacements—returned prisoners from Russia—are said to have mutinied at\r\nBreslau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         11th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │21 Res.  │10 Res.  │21 Res.  │10 Res.  │23.      │10 Res.\r\n              │         │11 Res.  │         │11 Res.  │         │22.\r\n              │23.      │22.      │23.      │22.      │         │156.\r\n              │         │156.     │         │156.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Res.

This division, with the 12th Reserve Division, formed the 6th Reserve\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE-MEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of the war it belonged to the 5th Army (Prussian\r\nCrown Prince). Fought at Arrancy from August 22 to 25; crossed the Meuse\r\nthe 21st of September. Fought in the region of Cierges September 2;\r\nadvanced nearly to Triaucourt September 9 and retreated through the east\r\nof the Argonne near Montfaucon September 11 to 17.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September it established itself at the eastern edge of\r\nthe Argonne (Varennes-Malancourt wood). It occupied this region until\r\nthe Verdun offensive in February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. January to December, 1915, the division held the sector of Malancourt\r\nwood, south of Montfaucon, in Argonne. In April the 11th Reserve\r\nInfantry was transferred to form the 117th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1916, when the battle of Verdun commenced, the division\r\nwas still in its sector on the left bank of the Meuse.\r\n\r\n2. In March it fought near Bethencourt. It took this village April 9.\r\nRelieved about May 15 after suffering very heavy losses (68 per cent of\r\nits infantry).\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest and reorganized with replacements from the 1916 class.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. It was at first army reserve in the region of Cambrai at the\r\nbeginning of June. Then a hurry call was sent for the division June 27\r\nand it went into the battle of the Somme.\r\n\r\n5. July 2 to 3 it relieved some units of the 12th Division and 10th\r\nBavarian Division on the front Hardecourt to the Somme and suffered\r\nenormous losses from July 2 to 9.\r\n\r\n6. Received replacements July 10 and suffered again heavily between the\r\n10th and 20th in the same region. It was withdrawn from the Somme front\r\nabout July 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n7. Reconstituted again with replacements from the depots of the 12th\r\nArmy Corps and sent at the end of July and beginning of August to the\r\neast of Armentieres, south of the Lys, and held this sector until\r\nSeptember 20 to 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n8. At the end of September the division returned to the Somme, between\r\nthe Somme and Barleux. It opposed the attack of the French October 18 to\r\n19 in the sector of Biaches.\r\n\r\n9. The division was relieved from the Somme area at the beginning of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n10. Sent to Artois and went into line at the beginning of December in\r\nthe sector of Lens, between Loos and Lievin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. About March 24 to 25, 1917, the division was withdrawn from the\r\nArtois front.\r\n\r\n2. In line for six weeks between Cambrai and St. Quentin, in the sector\r\nBellicourt-Bellenglise, from the end of March to May 10. Returned about\r\nMay 14 to 15 to the region of Lens, where it stayed until August 20.\r\n(Attack of the Canadians on its right flank Aug. 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS-FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. At rest in the vicinity of St. Amand (Artois) at the end of August\r\nand beginning of September. Held the front south of Lens (sector Frenoy-\r\nAcheville) September 9. In November it was sent to Flanders near\r\nPasschendaele, where it alternated with the 12th Reserve Division until\r\nJanuary, 1918. At rest from the middle of January and went back into\r\nline February 24 south of the forest of Houthulst.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSilesia. Drafts from other districts—for example, the fourth—to\r\ncounterbalance the Polish element.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAt the present time (February, 1918) it is difficult to form a precise\r\nopinion of the fighting qualities of this division, as it has not been\r\nseriously engaged since the battle of the Somme. In the sector of Lens\r\nand Frenoy the heavy losses which it suffered from gas have no doubt\r\ncaused a certain weakening of the morale. (One company of the 156th\r\nInfantry was reduced to 24 men.)\r\n\r\nIn Flanders the division held a difficult sector, but arrived at a time\r\nwhen active operations were coming to an end. The nature of the ground\r\nhas been the main cause of its losses. (Information from the British,\r\nFeb. 9, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSCHENDAELE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line south of Passchendaele until January\r\n16, when it was relieved by the 31st Division. It then moved to the\r\nOostroosebeke area, where it underwent a course of training in open\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. February 24 the division relieved the 199th Division astride the\r\nYpres-Staden railway (northeast of Ypres).\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENTIERES.\r\n\r\n3. It was relieved about the 18th of March by the extension of front of\r\nthe neighboring divisions, and one regiment was identified by prisoners\r\nas having reenforced the front south of Villers-Carbonnel (southwest of\r\nPeronne). This regiment was relieved March 26 and went to join the\r\nremainder of the division which was resting in the Turcoing area. April\r\n9 the division reenforced the front in the Croix du Bac sector (north of\r\nthe La Bassee Canal). It was withdrawn about the 16th, after losing\r\nheavily, and went to rest in the vicinity of Laventie.\r\n\r\n4. April 28 it relieved the 81st Reserve Division southwest of Meteren.\r\nIt was withdrawn about the 6th of May, going to be reconstituted in the\r\narea southeast of Bailleul.\r\n\r\n5. It relieved the 12th Division southwest of Meteren during the night\r\nof May 18–19, remaining in line until June 7, when it was withdrawn to\r\nrest in the Courtrai area.\r\n\r\n6. During the night of June 22–23 the division relieved the 216th\r\nDivision in the Locre sector (west of Kemmel). Here it fought until a\r\nday or two before the armistice, when it seems to have been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 11th Reserve is rated as a second-class division. It has fought a\r\ngreat deal during 1918, especially since June, and has lost heavily. Its\r\nrecord has not been brilliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        11th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │33 Ldw.       │75 Ldw.       │33 Ldw.       │75 Ldw.\r\n              │              │76 Ldw.       │              │76 Ldw.\r\n              │70 Mixed Ldw. │5 Ldw.        │70 Mixed Ldw. │5 Ldw.\r\n              │              │18 Ldw.       │              │18 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │92 Ldw.

(13th Reserve Bavarian: Third Bavarian District.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nOrganized in April, 1915, in Galicia, in the Carpathians.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. This division belonged to Mackensen’s army during the offensive in\r\nGalicia and took part in the capture of Przemysl May 31, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUG.\r\n\r\n2. Sent north, fought at Rava Ruska, and reached the Bug in the region\r\nof Cholm-Vlodava. Withdrew from the front at the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n3. In September and October the division took part in the campaign\r\nagainst Serbia with Mackensen’s army. Crossed the Danube October 8 to\r\n11; Valley of the Morawa; region of Monastir (November).\r\n\r\n4. Left the front November 15 and went to rest in Hungary at\r\nWeisskirchen until the beginning of February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. From February 9 to 10, 1916, the division entrained for the Western\r\nFront. Itinerary: Temesvar-Szegedin-Baja-Marburg-Graz-Salzburg-Munich-\r\nIngolstadt-Wurzburg-Frankfort on Main-Coblentz-Cologne-Liège-Malines.\r\nDetrained at Antwerp February 15.\r\n\r\n2. At rest in the region of Antwerp until March 1, and on that date it\r\nentrained for Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to the Verdun front (sector of Avocourt wood, Mar. 8), attacked\r\nMarch 20 and 22 and April 11 and suffered considerable losses; 75 per\r\ncent of its infantry out of action.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved at the beginning of June and sent to rest in the region of\r\nThionville, then sent to Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. June 14 it returned to Russia. Itinerary: Solesme Busigny-Maubeuge-\r\nLiège-Aix la Chapelle-Hanover-Brest Litovsk-Kovel.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOVEL.\r\n\r\n6. Went into action immediately and counterattacked near the Kovel-Rovno\r\nRailroad and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n7. In October it took part in the Roumanian campaign (Valley of the\r\nJiul).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Braila front at the beginning of January, 1917,\r\nand again entrained for France on the 10th. Itinerary: Bucarest-\r\nBudapest-Vienna-Salzburg-Munich. Detrained the 22d at Barr (Alsace).\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. In April held the sector Burnhaupt-Rhone-Rhine canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Sent from Mulhouse to Marle April 26 to 28, then to the south of Laon\r\nand took over the sector of Cernay May 5 to 6, where its losses were due\r\nespecially to artillery fire.\r\n\r\n4. At rest in the region of Laon June 6 to August 3.\r\n\r\n5. Coucy sector August 3 to September 15. The division did not have any\r\nhard action here, but suffered again from bombardment.\r\n\r\n6. September 15, at rest in the vicinity of Sedan for one month.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n7. Entrained at Sedan October 15 to 17; detrained at Courtrai October\r\n18; went into line the 22d in the sector of Passchendaele, where it\r\nsuffered heavily from the British attack of the 26th. Relieved\r\nimmediately after this engagement and reorganized.\r\n\r\n8. November 2 the division went back into line south of Passchendaele,\r\nbut did not have any serious actions.\r\n\r\n9. November 10, relieved and sent to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n10. From November 18 to January 12, 1918, the division held the sector\r\nChauvoncourt-Seuzey north of St. Mihiel. It took part in no infantry\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Bavarian country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThis division may be considered good. It took part on the Eastern and\r\nWestern Fronts in a large number of battles, “Przemysl, Verdun, Argesul,\r\nFilipesci” (speech of William II), and did well everywhere (January,\r\n1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUVRE.\r\n\r\n1. The 11th Bavarian Division remained in the Seuzey sector, resting and\r\nbeing reconstituted, until relieved by the 82d Reserve Division on\r\nJanuary 12.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of February it relieved the 1st Division in the\r\nEtain sector. This, too, was a very quiet sector and the division was\r\nnot identified by contact. It was relieved about March 27 by the 10th\r\nLandwehr Division, and remained in rear of the Verdun front for a\r\nfortnight. It is probable that it was trained during this period, but\r\nthe fact has never been definitely established.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENTIERES.\r\n\r\n3. The division was then sent to the Armentieres front, where it\r\nrelieved the 214th Division in the Neuve Eglise sector (northwest of\r\nArmentieres) April 13–14. Here it took part in very heavy fighting,\r\nespecially south of Mount Kemmel, and suffered heavy losses as a result.\r\nIt was withdrawn on the 26th of April, and proceeded to the area\r\nnortheast of Ghent, detraining at Wachtebeke on the 29th. Here it was\r\nbrought up to strength and reviewed by the King of Bavaria on May 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n4. About June 3 the division left the Ghent region; it was identified in\r\nrear of the front in the region of Soissons on June 9. A few days later\r\nit reinforced the front near Coeuvres (southwest of Soissons). It was\r\nrelieved by the 14th Division on June 21.\r\n\r\n5. After resting immediately in rear of the front, it suffered severe\r\nlosses from bombardment by gas shells during this period. The division\r\ncame back into line in the Courmelles sector (south of Soissons) about\r\nJuly 15. July 18 it lost over 2,400 in prisoners alone. It was withdrawn\r\nabout July 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested for about a month. It was reconstituted, it being\r\nfound necessary to dissolve one company in each battalion. August 26 the\r\ndivision relieved the 49th Reserve Division east of Boesinghe (northwest\r\nof Ypres). It fought, taking part in the general retirement, until\r\nwithdrawn October 2, after losing more than 500 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nGHENT.\r\n\r\n7. The division reinforced the front near Beveren (southwest of Ghent),\r\nand had not been withdrawn up to the time the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 11th Bavarian is rated as being in the first of four classes of\r\ndivisions. It fought well during 1918, but not brilliantly. Its losses\r\nwere heavy, but not in comparison with other German divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             12th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │34.      │23.      │24.      │23.      │24.      │23.\r\n              │         │62.      │         │62.      │         │62.\r\n              │78.      │63.      │78.      │63.      │         │63.\r\n              │         │157.     │         │157.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │11 Horse Jag.

The 12th Division, forming with the 11th Division the 6th Army Corps\r\n(Breslau), formed a part of the 5th Army (German Crown Prince) at the\r\nbeginning of the war, took part in the battle of August 22 at Rossignol\r\nles Bulles, entered France August 24, passed the Meuse above Mouzon on\r\nAugust 28, and took part in the battle on September 7 at Laheycourt and\r\nVillotte near Louppy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. After the battle of the Marne it was engaged (Sept. 21) at Berru and\r\nat Nogent l’Abbesse (east of Rheims). It remained on the Rheims front\r\nuntil the middle of June, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In April the 12th Division gave the 157th Infantry Regiment to the\r\n117th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the middle of June, 1915, the 6th Army Corps was relieved on\r\nthe Rheims front and transferred to Artois. The 12th Division then\r\noccupied a sector to the south of Souchez, from which it was relieved\r\ntoward the end of September. In the Souchez sector it took part in some\r\nvery heavy engagements (1st to the 16th of July).\r\n\r\n3. After a rather short rest period in the region of Cambrai, the\r\ndivision took its position in the sector which crosses the Somme (during\r\nthe first half of October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. On the 1st of July, 1916, the 12th Division received the entire\r\nweight of the English attack north of the Somme (sectors Contalmaison-\r\nHardecourt) and suffered very heavily (losses 61.5 per cent).\r\n\r\n2. It was relieved on July 12 and reorganized in the vicinity of\r\nCambrai.\r\n\r\n3. About the 20th of July the 12th Division again took part in the\r\nbattle of the Somme (in the sector northeast of Pozières), where it\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. About the 9th of August it was relieved, and on the 21st went into\r\nthe calm sector of Monchy aux Bois (south of Arras), which it held until\r\nOctober 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCRE.\r\n\r\n5. The 12th Division then held (Oct. 25 to Nov. 19) the sector north of\r\nthe Ancre (Beaumont-Hamel) and suffered heavy losses (Nov. 14).\r\n\r\n6. It was transferred to Champagne and took over the sector of Prunay on\r\nDecember 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of December it was relieved from this quiet sector and\r\nentrained on December 28, at Warmeriville for the Russian front by the\r\nroute Aix la Chapelle-Cologne-Hanover-Luneburg-Hamburg-Stettin-\r\nKönigsberg-Tilsit-Chavli-Ponieviej. It detrained southwest of Illuxt on\r\nJanuary 2, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. On the Russian front the 12th Division did not take part in any\r\nimportant battles. (Sector in the region of Dwinsk.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about the end of May, 1917, it returned to the Western\r\nFront. Itinerary Jelowka (May 27) -Insterburg-Posen-Leipzig-Weimar-\r\nCologne-Saarbrucken. Detrained at Metz June 3 and reentrained on the 9th\r\nat Ars sur Moselle for Mouscron, by way of Metz-Luxemburg-Namur-Tournai,\r\nand detrained at Gheluwe.\r\n\r\n3. It remained in reserve first on the Wytschaete-Messines front, and\r\nthen (Aug. 1) relieved the 22d Reserve Division in the sector east of\r\nKlein-Zillebeke after the Franco-British attack. In this sector the\r\ndivision did not engage in battle but suffered greatly from artillery\r\nbombardments.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n4. It was relieved on August 20 and transferred to Alsace for\r\nreorganization and rest. It remained in the region west of Bale until\r\nthe end of September. It was then sent to the Italian front, to the 14th\r\nGerman Army, where it was engaged in the Tolmino sector on October 25,\r\nand relieved on the Piave about the 8th of December.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n5. The 12th Division was brought back from Italy to the French front\r\nabout December 25. At the beginning of January, 1918, it was in the\r\nneighborhood of Zabern.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 12th Division is recruited from Upper Silesia, a great mining and\r\nindustrial center, which suffices to insure its own full recruiting and\r\neven helps out other districts less populated or temporarily below\r\nstrength. The sending of these men outside of the district has the\r\nadvantage of reducing, in its own regiments, the Polish element, which\r\ndominates in Upper Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 12th Division fought well at the Somme.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been reorganized during its stay at Zabern (January,\r\n1918). It has always been considered a good division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. On January 24 the 12th division entered the Domevre sector, relieving\r\nthe 233d Division. It was relieved on February 20 and went to rest and\r\ntrain in Alsace. On March 18 it entrained at Froeschweiler and moved to\r\nAth, from where it marched to the Gory-Belloune area, south of Douai (a\r\nmarch of 40 miles).\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 23d the division moved to Drury and up the Cambrai-Arras road\r\nto Vis en Artois, coming into line on the night of March 23–24. It\r\nattacked on the 24th, but was held up by the British artillery fire. It\r\nremained in line until April 1, making little progress in spite of heavy\r\nand costly fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in the suburbs of Douai until mid-April. It was\r\nengaged northeast of Merris on the 17th. It appears to have received\r\nreplacements in the interim. The division passed into the second line on\r\nMay 18, after suffering especially heavy losses. In recognition of the\r\nservice of the 12th Division, south of Arras and in the Lys battle, Gen.\r\nLequis, the division commander, received the Order of Merit in May.\r\n\r\n4. The division was at rest near Renaix (Belgium) from May 29 to July\r\n12. It entrained at Audenarde on the 12th and moved to Perenchies (via\r\nCoutrai and Lille).\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEREN.\r\n\r\n5. The division was engaged south of Meteren on the night of July 19–20;\r\nhere it remained until August 28. In a local operation on August 18 the\r\ndivision lost 300 prisoners, otherwise the sector was quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. It entrained near Armentieres on August 28 and went to a point north\r\nof Douai (Le Forest). It was engaged southeast of Morchies on September\r\n3, and in the days following was driven back on Inchy en Artois,\r\nMarquion (3d to 13th). By the end of September it had passed Bourlon,\r\nEpinoy, Aubencheul au Bac, and Fressies. The division was relieved about\r\nOctober 6. The division lost more than 1,100 prisoners.\r\n\r\n7. It was reengaged on October 11 southeast of Armentieres. It retreated\r\nby Lille (Oct. 20) east of Tourcoing, and at Helchin. On the 25th it was\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n8. On November 3 it was again in line east of Joulain and remained until\r\nthe armistice. In withdrawing the division passed Maresches, Jenlain,\r\nAutreppe, and Blangies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a second-class division. It was actively\r\nengaged in the spring offensives and did well. After the middle of July\r\nit was almost constantly engaged in hard defensive fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         12th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │22 Res.  │38 Res.  │22 Res.  │38 Res.  │22 Res.  │23 Res.\r\n              │         │51 Res.  │         │51 Res.  │         │38 Res.\r\n              │23 Res.  │22 Res.  │23 Res.  │22 Res.  │         │51 Res.\r\n              │         │23 Res.  │         │23 Res.  │6 Res.   │Jag.

At the outbreak of the war, the division detrained at Sarrebruecken;\r\nfought in the neighborhood of Arrancy from the 22d to the 25th of\r\nAugust; remained at Mangiennes from the 27th to the 30th; crossed the\r\nMeuse on September 1; was beaten back with heavy losses on September 2\r\nnear Cierges; was at Rarécourt on the 7th and near Triaucourt on the\r\n9th; spread out to the east of the Argonne upon Gercourt (11th to the\r\n13th) and Montfaucon (Sept. 17).\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September to the end of October took up its position\r\neast of Varennes in the district of Malancourt-Chattancourt and toward\r\nthe end of October took its final position north of Bethencourt\r\n(southeast of Cuisy-Bois de Forges).\r\n\r\n3. The division occupied this sector until the German offensive upon\r\nVerdun (end of February, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. January to December, 1915, sector north of Bethencourt-Bois de\r\nForges.\r\n\r\nIn April the 27th Infantry Regiment Reserve was transferred to the 117th\r\nDivision, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. In September, 1915, elements of the 12th Reserve Division (battalion\r\nof the 23d Reserve Infantry Regiment) were detached in Champagne (Main\r\nde Massiges) to reinforce divisions engaged in fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of February, when the Verdun offensive began, the 12th\r\nReserve Division still held the line in the region of Bois de Forges.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. On the 6th of March, 1916, the division went into action; it took the\r\nvillage of Forges and, on March 10, the Corbeaux wood. It vainly\r\nattacked the Mort Homme.\r\n\r\n3. It was withdrawn from the Verdun front in the middle of May, after\r\nsuffering heavy losses (71 per cent of its infantry). It was first at\r\nrest in the Thionville region, and then in reserve in the Cambrai\r\nregion, at the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On July 2 it took part in the battle of the Somme (sector of\r\nMontauban-Hardecourt). It counterattacked near the Trônes wood and\r\nsuffered very heavy losses. It was relieved about July 14, completely\r\nexhausted. (On the 10th of July not a single officer remained in the 2d\r\nBattalion of the 38th Reserve Infantry Regiment (letter). From the 17th\r\nof March to the 5th of July the 5th Company of the 23d Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment received no less than 326 men as replacements).\r\n\r\n5. On July 15 it was sent to rest in the Manancourt region. Elements of\r\nthe division still remained in line, along the Somme near Guillemont,\r\nuntil August 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. From the beginning of August until September 26–27, the 12th Reserve\r\nDivision occupied a sector north of the Lys, near Armentières (Warneton-\r\nMessines), where it once more suffered losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of September the division was once more on the Somme front\r\n(Barleux-Berny). It remained there until the beginning of November\r\nwithout suffering any great losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n8. Transferred to Artois, it went into line on Vimy Ridge (sector Vimy-\r\nRoclincourt) at the beginning of December. It suffered fairly heavy\r\nlosses. At the present time, 17 per cent of the prisoners from the 51st\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment belong to the 1917 class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 12th Reserve Division remained on the Vimy front until February\r\n27, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. It was resting in the Avesnes region during the month of March.\r\n\r\n3. From April 9–12 to May 24 it held the lines between Itancourt and the\r\nOise.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n4. After a fortnight’s rest in the Guise region, it occupied (from the\r\nbeginning of June to Aug. 6–8), the St. Quentin sector (south of Fayet).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. On August 7 the division entrained for Flanders, at Fresnoy le Grand.\r\nDisembarking near Courtrai, it was first in reserve near Passchendaele.\r\nA few of the elements of the division engaged in battle at Langemarck on\r\nthe 17th of August. It was in line in the St. Julien sector (northeast\r\nof Ypres) on August 20, and relieved on August 24, after suffering heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n6. In rest at Origny, from August 29 to September 9, the division then\r\noccupied the sector southwest of St. Quentin (Sept. 9 to Nov. 11–12).\r\n\r\nIt left at this latter date to occupy the front south of Passchendaele\r\nuntil the middle of February, 1918, being relieved several times in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSilesia, especially Upper Silesia. In 1916, following the losses\r\nsuffered at Verdun, a great number of the replacement troops consisted\r\nof men from the 3d and 4th Corps Districts (Brandenburg and Prussian\r\nSaxony) and of the 1916 class, and of returned convalescents of the 9th\r\nand 10th Corps Districts (Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover). This measure\r\nwas not only dictated by necessity, but contributed to counterbalance\r\nthe original Polish element.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAt Ypres (August, 1917), a certain number of men of the 51st Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment refused to go into the trenches; according to\r\nprisoners, desertions to the rear were frequent, especially among the\r\nyounger men.\r\n\r\nThe combat morale of the 12th Reserve Division may, however, have been\r\nrestored during its long stay in the relatively quiet sector of St.\r\nQuentin (September to November, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. On February 4 the division relieved the 12th Reserve Division in the\r\nMoorslede sector which it held until February 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n2. It was relieved by the 31st Division and moved south to relieve the\r\n17th Division on night of February 17–18. It held this front until about\r\nApril 10, when it was relieved by the 9th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n3. The division reinforced the battle front at Neuve Eglise on April 13\r\nand fought until about April 25, suffering heavy losses. One company of\r\nthe 51st Reserve Regiment was reduced to 9 men.\r\n\r\n4. Upon relief, the division returned to its former sector near Lens,\r\nwhere it was identified near Avion on April 27. It remained here until\r\nJune 14, when it moved north and entered the line northeast of Hinges on\r\nJune 17–18. About August 6, the division was relieved by the 1st Guard\r\nReserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n5. It moved to Douai and rested until its return to line near Ecoust on\r\nnight of August 30–31 to resist the British attack. Before its\r\nwithdrawal on the 11th it had lost nearly 900 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested at Cambrai during September and reentered the\r\nLens sector on October 2. During October it was engaged at Noyelles\r\n(11th), Wattines (19th), and Rumignies (21st). It appears to have been\r\nout of line for a few days, returning on the night of November 3–4 west\r\nof Orsinval. It was at Wargnies le Petit (5th), St. Waast la Vallee\r\n(6th), Bavai (7th), northeast of Taisnieres (9th), and Villers St.\r\nGuislain (11th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It appears to have been used\r\nprincipally as a sector-holding division on moderately active fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        12th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │55 Ldw.       │87 Ldw.

The 12th Landwehr Division was formed toward the end of April, 1915,\r\nwith the elements of the Landwehr, which were distributed along the\r\nAlsatian front, between the Fecht and the district of Cernay, and which\r\nwere assigned to the Fuchs Division at the time of the attacks upon\r\nHartmannswillerkopf (March-April). The active brigade of the Fuchs\r\nDivision having left the Vosges for Champagne, the 12th Landwehr\r\nDivision grouped these elements of the Landwehr and occupied until May,\r\n1917, the sectors included between the valley of Munster and Cernay. On\r\nthe 21st of December, 1915, the 14th Jager Battalion, attached to the\r\ndivision, lost at Hartmannswillerkopf 840 killed, wounded, and missing\r\n(official list of casualties), and was withdrawn to be reorganized in\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. Sector Guebwiller-Cernay.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September, 1916, the 40th Landwehr Regiment left the 12th\r\nLandwehr Division to be assigned to the 33d Division. It was replaced by\r\nthe 436th Landwehr Regiment, which had been formed in May of the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nIn October the battalions of Jagers and of the riflemen of the guard and\r\nthe 9th Battalion of Jagers, attached to the 12th Landwehr Division,\r\nwere sent to Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. January-May, 1917. Sector Munster-Cernay.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved on the Alsatian front about the middle of May, the 12th\r\nLandwehr Division was transferred to Galicia. Itinerary: Cernay-\r\nStrassborg-Karlsruhe-Ludwigsburg-Munich, Salzburg-Vienna-Lemberg-\r\nZloczow.\r\n\r\n3. It occupied the sector south of Brody and northwest of Zalosce until\r\nthe beginning of 1918. It took part in the attacks of July, 1917.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the final months of 1917 the 12th Landwehr Division had\r\nnumerous troops taken to fill up units on the Western Front or to be\r\nsent to the 227th Division, 197th Division, or the 33d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 12th Landwehr Division, which was on the Alsatian front until May,\r\n1917 and then in Galicia, appears to be of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The history of the component elements of this division after their\r\narrival on the Western Front is uncertain. Between March and June the\r\n56th Landwehr Regiment was in the 6th Army, the 436th Landwehr Regiment\r\nwas in the 2d Army, and the 87th Landwehr Regiment was in the 18th Army.\r\nThe men of these units were assigned to various kinds of police work,\r\nguarding prisoners, etc. The staff of the division during this period\r\nwas believed to be in Finland. About July 15 the division had been\r\nannounced as dissolved by the French, British, and American general\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. On August 7 the 87th Landwehr Regiment and the 436th Landwehr\r\nRegiment were joined as infantry under the 21st Landwehr Brigade Staff,\r\nGen. Hoffman, of the 14th Landwehr Division. The 56th Landwehr Regiment\r\nwas also identified in this region and the division was regarded as\r\nreconstituted in October.\r\n\r\n3. Later identifications disclosed that the regiments were not forming a\r\ndivision but were acting independently. The division was again classed\r\nas dissolved about the middle of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a third-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        12th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │22 Bav.  │26 Bav.  │22 Bav.  │26 Bav.  │22 Bav.  │26 Bav.\r\n              │         │27 Bav.  │         │27 Bav.  │         │27 Bav.\r\n              │         │28 Bav.  │         │28 Bav.  │         │28 Bav.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 7 Bav.

It was assembled\r\nin July, 1916, at Grafenwoehr Camp (Bavaria), and remained until the end\r\nof July in the Valley of the Fecht, and then entrained for the Roumanian\r\nfront in October.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. Composed of the 26th, 27th, and 28th Bavarian Regiments, the division\r\ntook part in the Roumanian campaign and fought in the region of\r\nCampolung (October-November, 1916).\r\n\r\n2. In December it took part in the operations north of the road Buzeu-\r\nRimnicu-Sarat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOCSANI.\r\n\r\n1. Beginning with January, 1917, the 12th Bavarian Division remained in\r\nline north of Focsani.\r\n\r\n2. In August it took part in the attacks launched against the Roumanians\r\nnorth of Focsani (from Batinesci to the Sereth) and suffered very heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANCIU.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest after these engagements, it came back into line at the\r\nend of September, south of Panciu (Marasesti District).\r\n\r\n4. In December it was in reserve in the Focsani District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is recruited from the whole of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Roumanian front from October, 1916.

The division entrained at Ploesci on April 30 and traveled via\r\nBucharest-Craiova-Budapest-Dresden-Frankfurt on the Main-Mainz-Mezieres\r\nto a station between Mezieres and Rethel, where it detrained after a\r\njourney of nine days. It rested near Vieil St. Remy (20 kilometers\r\nsoutheast of Mezieres), until May 24, when it marched toward the Aisne\r\nby Chateau Porcien, Asfeld, Avaux, and Neufchatel.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n2. The division crossed the old line near Berry au Bac on May 28 and\r\nfollowed the advance through Roucy, Montigny sur Vesle and Lagery. It\r\nwas engaged on the 30th near Ville en Tardenois, with the Marne between\r\nDamery and Cumieres as its final objective. In that sector it stayed\r\nuntil July 13–14. Losses were heavy about the end of May and the 1st of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n3. It was in reserve in the same sector on the 15th behind the 22d\r\nDivision, on the 17th it attacked and until the end of July took part in\r\nthe struggle for Epernay, toward which the division got as far as the\r\nBois Courton.\r\n\r\n4. Upon its relief on July 26 the division marched to the Ligny en\r\nCambresis area in stages. There it rested until August 29, when it\r\nentrained at Solesmes and traveled via Valenciennes-Condes-Ath-Ghent to\r\nRoubaix. After two days’ rest it reentrained and was railed via Courtrai\r\nto Isegheim, relieving the 6th Cavalry Division east of Ypres on the\r\nnight of August 31-September 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. In this sector the division sustained an attack by the British on\r\nSeptember 28. It was thrown back on Moorslede with a loss of 3,000\r\nprisoners. The division was relieved on October 1.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested at Roubaix until October 17, when it returned to\r\nline southeast of Herseaux. It continued in this region until the\r\narmistice. The last identification was at Cordes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a third-class division. Its morale appears to\r\nhave been low in the summer and fall of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             13th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │25.      │13.      │25.      │13.      │26.      │13.\r\n              │         │158.     │         │158.     │         │15.\r\n              │26.      │15.      │26.      │15.      │         │55.\r\n              │         │55.      │         │55.      │         │\r\n              │11 Jag.

The 13th Division, forming with the 14th Division the 7th Army Corps,\r\nwas a part, at the outbreak of the war, of the 2d Army (Von Buelow). It\r\nentrained in the vicinity of Eupen from the 9th to the 11th of August,\r\nand the 25th Brigade took part in the final operations of the siege of\r\nLiège. After the fall of this place the division reassembled, passed\r\nthrough Wavre, Nivelles, Seneffe, crossed the Sambre below Thuin (battle\r\nof Charleroi), entered France on August 25, and left the 26th Brigade in\r\nfront of Maubeuge, where it remained until the city was taken (Sept. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. The 25th Brigade, going forward, fought east of St. Quentin on the\r\n29th, and was at Montmirail on September 6, where it took part in the\r\nbattle of the Marne. After the 26th Brigade was released it reached Laon\r\non the 10th, and on the 12th the entire 13th Division went into position\r\nnorth of Rheims, forming a part of the 7th Army (Von Heeringen). It\r\nremained there until the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of October the 13th Division was transferred to\r\nArtois, where it remained until the end of March, 1916. It fought in the\r\nsector Angres-Souchez in October and November, in that of Fromelles-\r\nAubers in November and December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\nIn March and in June, 1915, the division underwent two heavy attacks at\r\nNeuve Chapelle and at Festubert. The battles from the 6th to the 29th of\r\nMarch, 1915, cost the 13th Infantry Regiment 21 officers and 1,301\r\nnoncommissioned officers in killed, wounded, and missing. (Official list\r\nof Prussian casualties.)\r\n\r\nIn March the division transferred the 158th Infantry Regiment to the\r\n50th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN (HILL 304).\r\n\r\n1. Relieved at the end of March, 1916, the 13th Division was sent to\r\nrest in the Cambrai area.\r\n\r\n2. About the 5th of June the division entrained and was sent to the\r\nVerdun area by way of Montmédy-Stenay. It went into line in the sector\r\nof Hill 304, which it occupied until the month of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to the Somme, it took part in the battle on September 12\r\n(south of Vouchavesnes-Cléry sur Somme). It suffered heavy losses there\r\nwhich necessitated its being relieved on September 19.\r\n\r\n4. It was quickly reorganized in the Dun area and put back in the sector\r\nof Hill 304 (Oct. 10).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 13th Division remained in line at Hill 304 until the middle of\r\nMay, 1917. It was then relieved in this area and sent to the Aisne,\r\nwhere it remained at rest for three weeks near Laon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. On the 9th of June it began to take over the sector of Cerny. It\r\nlaunched an important attack on July 31 upon the Deimling salient, but\r\nwas not able to retain the ground won. On August 2–3 it attacked again,\r\nbut without success. The 13th and 15th Infantry Regiments each lost 600\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n3. The 13th Division, very much exhausted, was relieved during the night\r\nof August 3–4. It was transferred by railroad to the St. Gobain area\r\nwithout having time to fill up its regiments, and went into line in the\r\nDeuillet-Servais sector, which it held from August 10 to September 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA MALMAISON.\r\n\r\n4. It was at rest in the area of Crépy en Laonnois (Sept. 20 to Oct.\r\n11). The division was filled up from the recruit depots of neighboring\r\ndivisions, although they were not Westphalians (5th Reserve Division,\r\n29th Division, and 103d Division). About the 11th of October it again\r\nwent into line on the Chemin des Dames east of Laffaux mill. Beginning\r\nwith October 15, it suffered heavy losses from our artillery\r\npreparation. On the 23d it underwent the French attack. (Losses: 47\r\nofficers and 1,548 men prisoners, including 2 regimental commanders, a\r\nthird being killed.) The division may be considered as exhausted at the\r\nMennejean Farm.\r\n\r\n5. It was sent to the Sedan area and reorganized. About November 10 it\r\nreceived 1,000 men from Russia as replacements (men at least 35 years of\r\nage).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. About December 18 it occupied the sector of the Bois de Malancourt-\r\nHaucourt (and was still there on Jan. 23, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Division is a Westphalian Division, in addition to contingents\r\nfrom the two principalities of Lippe. These were even mentioned with\r\nhonor in the German communique of July 1, 1917, a thing which would\r\nordinarily be sufficient to identify the division.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, however, that in 1917 the provincial character of the\r\ndivision had been very much changed. The replacements of September (1918\r\nclass) were taken from the recruit depots nearby (5th Reserved Division,\r\n29th Division, 103d Division), and introduced, especially in the 15th\r\nInfantry Regiment, men from Brandenburg, Baden, and Thuringia. Some\r\nWestphalians came in October, but they were mostly older men (classes\r\n1892 to 1903 of the Landsturm), coming from Landsturm battalion of the\r\n7th Corps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn the Somme battle (September, 1916) the 13th Division put up a\r\nvigorous defense and did not yield any ground.\r\n\r\nOn the Aisne (June-July, 1916) its combat value was just as great; it\r\nattacked vigorously and put up a stubborn resistance to our\r\ncounterattacks. Besides that, it is mentioned in the German communiques:\r\nSeptember, 1916, for its valor on the Somme, December 20, 1916, and\r\nJanuary 25, 1917 (Hill 304); January 29, 1917, the 15th and the 13th\r\nInfantry Regiments are praised for their heroic resistance. It may be\r\nconsidered as a good division.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed, however, that on October 23, on the Chemin des\r\nDames, in spite of stringent orders to hold its position, the 13th\r\nDivision put up very little resistance; units surrendered en masse with\r\ntheir officers.\r\n\r\nThe 55th Infantry Regiment is probably only of mediocre worth since its\r\nreconstruction after the battle of Malmaison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved from the Verdun front about February 6 and\r\nwent to rest in the vicinity of Arlon, and after February 15 at\r\nValenciennes and Mons. It marched to the Somme front in four nights, and\r\nthen rested at Clary for two days.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On March 21 it was in reserve of the 18th Division, during the\r\nadvance toward Roisel. It was partially engaged on the 22d and 23d north\r\nof Marquaix and Peronne. Two days later the entire division was engaged\r\nnorth of the Somme, and on the 28th it passed to reserve near\r\nMorlancourt until April 4, when it returned to the battle front for four\r\ndays, fighting at Dernancourt. Again the division retired to the second\r\nline, and was relieved on the 11th. The losses of the division in this\r\noffensive were about 40 per cent of its effectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVRE.\r\n\r\n3. After 10 days’ rest (near Maricourt-Carnoy until the 18th and Caix\r\nuntil the 22d) during which it was reconstituted with returned wounded\r\nand 1919 recruits, it returned to line on the Avre (Castel) on April 23.\r\nThe division executed attacks on Hill 82 and on Hailles on April 24.\r\nOther local attacks occurred on May 2 and 14. It was relieved on May 18.\r\nA further draft of 1,300 men was received on May 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested near Montdidier in June, probably at Moreuil. On\r\nJuly 1 it relieved the 77th Reserve Division northeast of Villers-\r\nBretonneux. The British attack on the Somme threw the division back on\r\nMericourt with a loss of 2,769 prisoners. On August 12 it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n5. It was in reserve near Mericourt during the middle of August. On the\r\n24th it was reengaged east of Albert (Bazentin). About the 30th it was\r\nwithdrawn. The total loss in prisoners was 3,400.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n6. The division was moved to Alsace for a rest. It entrained at\r\nSchlestadt on September 29 and was moved by Strasbourg, Metz, and Sedan.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. It went into line at Monthois-Challerange on September 30, remaining\r\nuntil October 3, when it went into support near Morel until the 8th,\r\nwhen it fell back toward Bourcq.\r\n\r\n8. It was in support between Landres-Saint George and Bantheville on the\r\n15th. It was engaged on the American front on the 16th in the\r\nNantheville region. It was in line until the 30th, when it passed to\r\nreserve, but returned to line on the 2d. It continued to hold a sector\r\nuntil the armistice. An epidemic of Spanish fever greatly reduced the\r\nnumber of effectives in all the regiments. The 13th Regiment had less\r\nthan 200 effectives at the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a first-class division. Its performance was\r\nexcellent in the March offensive, but after that it took no special part\r\nin any offensive. At the armistice the division had been used up through\r\nlosses and sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         13th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │25 Res.  │13 Res.  │25 Res.  │13 Res.  │28 Res.  │13 Res.\r\n              │         │56 Res.  │         │56 Res.  │         │39 Res.\r\n              │28 Res.  │39 Res.  │28 Res.  │39 Res.  │         │57 Res.\r\n              │         │57 Res.  │         │57 Res.  │ 7 Res.

Assigned to the 2d German Army, the 13th Reserve Division arrived at\r\nLiège immediately after the city and the forts were taken (Aug. 14);\r\nreached Namur on the 25th, and took part in the siege and taking of\r\nMaubeuge. When it was released from this place it was quickly\r\ntransferred to the front north of the Aisne; fought in the neighborhood\r\nof Pontavert-Craonne on September 15; fought near Cerny on the 16th, and\r\ntook its position on the front of Braye-Cerny en Laonnois at the end of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n2. On November 3 some elements of the division were engaged at Vailly.\r\n\r\n3. The division occupied the sector of Braye en Laonnois until October,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. January-October, 1915, the division occupied the sector Braye en\r\nLaonnois-Cerny.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of October the 13th Reserve Division was relieved in the\r\nLaon area and transferred to the north, between Charleroi and\r\nValenciennes. After a period of training in November and December, it\r\nentrained, about December 25, for the Verdun front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1916, the division was concentrated in\r\nthe neighborhood of Damvillers (right bank of the Meuse). In January and\r\nFebruary it was occupied in preparations for an attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning with February 21 some elements were engaged near Haumont,\r\nnear Haumont wood. It took part in battles, from February 23 until March\r\n10, in the region of Samogneux (sector of Vacherauville-Haudremont and\r\nCote du Poivre). It lost 51 per cent of its infantry there.\r\n\r\n3. From the middle of March to the 24th of October it occupied the same\r\nsector of Haudremont (west of Douaumont), and only took part in a few\r\nlocal engagements. It underwent the French attack on October 24 and\r\nsuffered heavily.\r\n\r\n4. Until December it held the sector included between the road of\r\nLouvemont-Bras and the Chaufour wood. It was relieved between December 8\r\nand 12 and sent to rest in the Marville-Longuyon area.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to Champagne (Dec. 22–24), it went into line east of\r\nRheims (Nogent l’Abbesse) about the 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector at Rheims (east of La Pomelle) until May\r\n20, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated, at this date, in the neighborhood of Epoye, it relieved\r\nthe exhausted 242d Division at Cornillet (south of Nauroy). It went into\r\naction between Mont Cornillet and Mont Haut (about the end of May).\r\n\r\n3. Between June 8 and 15 it returned into line in its former sector east\r\nof Rheims (south of Cernay), where it made several surprise attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved about the end of August from the Rheims front, it was sent,\r\nafter a few days of rest, to the right bank of the Meuse. On September\r\n24 it attacked east of Beaumont, in the Bois le Chaume, and suffered\r\nvery heavy losses. It made another attack on October 10 in the same\r\nsector, which it held until October 12–13.\r\n\r\n5. It was sent to rest (Briey area) in the second half of October. In\r\nNovember it appeared on the front east of Verdun, where it was speedily\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is recruited from Westphalia. In the course of 1917,\r\nhowever, a great number of its replacements came from other districts\r\nthan Westphalia (9th, 10th, 11th Corps Districts).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Reserve Division appears to be of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\nIt suffered heavy losses at Verdun. It showed very little brilliance\r\nthere. During the French attack of October 24, 1916, it offered little\r\nresistance to the hostile troops.\r\n\r\nOn the Rheims front (January to May, 1917) it did not take part in any\r\noperation. Quite a large number of men who were captured in the course\r\nof raids in this sector surrendered with little resistance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the 13th Reserve Division did not furnish a single prisoner or\r\ndeserter during its second stay southeast of Rheims (from June 15 to the\r\nbeginning of September), and on the Verdun front it showed itself quite\r\nactive (September to October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Avrocourt wood sector by the\r\nBavarian Ersatz Division on the night of April 5–6 and went into rest\r\nbillets at Villers near Montmedy. On the 16th it entrained at a station\r\nnear Montmedy and traveled via Carignan-Sedan-Charleville-Givet-Dinant-\r\nNamur-Charleroi-Ath-Melle-Ghent-Deyuze to Thielt, where it detrained at\r\n1 a. m. on April 19. After 10 days’ rest at Coolscamp the division\r\nmarched to Getsberg, and was to have gone into line in the Dixmude\r\nsector on April 22, but was suddenly entrained and moved via Roulers to\r\nBeythem. From there it marched to the Ledeghem area and rested until\r\nApril 24, when it marched into line northwest of Wytschaete via Menin-\r\nWervecq and Comines.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. The division was engaged in the attack on Voormezeele on April 25.\r\nAfter three days’ heavy fighting it was relieved by the 49th Reserve\r\nDivision. After a few days in the second line the division came back and\r\nrelieved the 49th Reserve Division. It remained in line until May 11.\r\nFrom the 11th to the 28th the division rested out of line. It was again\r\nengaged on May 28 southwest of Merris. It was relieved about June 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERRIS.\r\n\r\n3. The division went to rest in the area east of Bruges and later\r\nnorthwest of Ghent. It returned to its former sector west of Merris on\r\nJuly 9, relieving the 4th Bavarian Division. It held the sector until\r\nJuly 27 when its heavy losses at Meteren caused its relief by the 4th\r\nDivision. Between the 27th and August 18 the division rested in the\r\nDouai area.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES-BELGIUM.\r\n\r\n4. In line the 18th–19th, it relieved the 35th Division in the sector\r\neast of Merckem. Here the division continued until September 29, when it\r\nwas withdrawn from the line north of Staden after the loss of 1,500\r\nprisoners and severe casualties. It rested two weeks, and on October 14\r\nreturned to the battle front at Cortemarck. It fought until the 20th,\r\nwhen it retired for 10 days’ rest in rear of the line. On the 30th it\r\nwas reengaged near Deynze. The German communique of November 1 and 2\r\nmentioned the 57th and 13th Reserve Regiments for their good work. The\r\ndivision was in line until the armistice. It was last identified at\r\nNazareth on November 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Reserve Division was rated as a first-class division. In 1918\r\nit was almost wholly engaged in Belgium, taking a prominent part in the\r\nArmentiers offensive in April, and in the defense in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        13th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │61 Res.       │60 Res.       │61 Res.       │15 Ldw.\r\n              │              │Cassel Landst.│              │82 Ldw.\r\n              │              │  Btn.

The 13th Landwehr Division was formed in Lorraine about the middle of\r\nMay, 1915. It was made up at this time of the 61st Reserve Brigade (60th\r\nReserve Landsturm Battalions, Cassel and Mayence) and of the 60th\r\nLandwehr Brigade (the 60th Landwehr Regiment, and the 61st Landwehr\r\nRegiment). These elements were already in line on the Lorraine front\r\nbefore the formation of the division. The 71st Landwehr Regiment had\r\nbeen sent on August 10, 1914 (with the 82d Landwehr Regiment) to\r\nStrassburg as a garrison. The 60th Landwehr Regiment, beginning on\r\nAugust 11, was guarding the railroads of Lower Alsace. The 60th Infantry\r\nRegiment had been engaged in August in the Vosges.\r\n\r\n2. The 13th Landwehr Division occupied the sector between Abaucourt and\r\nthe Bezange woods from May, 1915, to February, 1917. Except for a few\r\nraids, it remained on the defensive during this long period.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of June, 1915, the 82d Landwehr Regiment replaced the 60th\r\nReserve Regiment.\r\n\r\nIn December the 15th Landwehr Regiment, which had formed the garrison of\r\nThionville at the outbreak of the war, and was in the Vosges after a\r\nstay near Morhange, replaced the two battalions of Landsturm (which had\r\nbeen formed into the 115th Landsturm Regiment in July) sent to Serbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In 1916 the division held the sector Abaucourt-Bezange wood.\r\n\r\nIn August the 9th Jager Battalion entrained for Galicia.\r\n\r\n2. On September 15, 1916, the staff of the 61st Reserve Brigade and the\r\n71st Landwehr Regiment were transferred to the 215th Division, a new\r\nformation. The 13th Landwehr Division then received its definite\r\norganization: 15th Landwehr Regiment, 60th Landwehr Regiment, 82d\r\nLandwehr Regiment (4 battalions each).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved on the Lorraine front in the beginning of February, 1917,\r\nthe 13th Landwehr Division was concentrated in the Chateau Salins front,\r\nentrained about the middle of February and sent by way of Metz-Longuyon-\r\nMontmedy-Sedan-Laon to the neighborhood of La Fère. It detrained at\r\nVersigny. One battalion was taken from each of its regiments to form the\r\n328th Landwehr Regiment, destined to be a part of the 25th Landwehr\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n2. Until March 18 the 13th Landwehr Division did work along the line\r\nMoy-La Fère-Fresne, where the German withdrawal was stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORÊT DE ST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n3. On March 19, placed on the east bank of the Ailette, it covered the\r\nretreat of the 45th Reserve Division, and at the beginning of April\r\noccupied the sector Fresnes-Prémontré, where it was relieved about the\r\n1st of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE LA FÈRE.\r\n\r\n4. After a fortnight’s rest in the forest of St. Gobain, it went back\r\ninto line on the front south of Alaincourt north of Deuillet (May 16).\r\nIt occupied the sector of the left bank of the Oise until the offensive\r\nof March, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Landwehr Division is apparently considered by the German High\r\nCommand as fit only to occupy a quiet sector (February, 1918).\r\n\r\nShock troops have been formed from its regiments, but the men appear to\r\nhave been trained for patrol work rather than for making genuine\r\nassaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved about March 24. It passed the night at\r\nVersigny, and on the 25th reached Laon, passing by Crepy and Aulnois.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n2. On the 26th the division came into line south of Laon, relieving the\r\n75th Reserve Division. It was engaged about Chevregny, Chavignon, and\r\nUrcil until May 27.\r\n\r\n3. It did not advance in the Aisne offensive. The attacking divisions\r\npassed through, and it was withdrawn and transported to Lorraine at the\r\nbeginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\nIt entered the line in the Woevre in the Combres Les Eparges sector\r\nabout the 1st of June and continued to hold the front until the\r\narmistice. In the American attack on the St. Mihiel salient the division\r\nlost about 800 men, principally prisoners. It was pushed back to\r\nChamplon and Marcheville, which sector it held until November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a fourth-class division. It was an inferior\r\nsector-holding unit of mediocre morale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             14th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │27.      │16.      │27.      │16.      │79.      │16.\r\n              │         │53.      │         │53.      │         │56.\r\n              │79.      │56.      │79.      │56.      │         │57.\r\n              │         │57.      │         │57.      │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │16 Uhlan Rgt.

The 14th Division was mobilized at the outbreak of the war with two\r\nof its three peace-time brigades (27th and 79th Brigades) and sent its\r\n28th Brigade to the 7th Reserve Corps (14th Reserve Division). The 27th\r\nBrigade (Cologne) was immediately sent against Liége, where it attacked\r\nwith the five other brigades of five different army corps. On August 13\r\nthe entire division was before Liége, where the other division of the\r\n7th Army Corps was on the 14th. With this latter division it formed part\r\nof the 2d Army (Von Buelow), of which it formed the right wing. It\r\nentered Belgium by way of Wavre and Nievelles, was engaged west of\r\nCharleroi, entered France by the valley of the Oise and took part in the\r\nbattle of the Marne, at Petit Morin, southeast of Montmirail.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of the retirement it stopped at the Chemin des Dames; was\r\nsent a short time afterwards to the area north of Rheims, from which\r\nplace it was transferred, at the time of the race to the sea, to Lille,\r\nwith the entire 7th Army Corps (at the beginning of October).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. Beginning with November, 1914, it occupied different sectors around\r\nLille, La Bassée, and Lens until the spring of 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The losses of the 14th Division were not very important during the\r\nfirst two years of the war. However, in March, 1915, and in June, 1915,\r\nit underwent two strong British attacks at Neuve Chapelle and Festubert,\r\nwhich inflicted heavy losses upon it, following which it had to be\r\nreenforced. From March 7 to March 12 the 3d Battalion of the 16th\r\nInfantry Regiment had no less than 589 casualties, 16 of whom were\r\nofficers (official list of casualties).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 14th Division was relieved at the end of 1916 from the Artois\r\nsector and, after a long period of rest near Tournai, was transferred to\r\nthe Verdun area.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. In June and July it occupied the Mort Homme sector.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of July it crossed over to the right bank of the Meuse and\r\nheld the sector of Thiaumont until August 25, where it suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n4. It then returned to the left bank of the Meuse (Cumieres) after a\r\nshort rest. It was again sent to the rear area about the middle of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n5. When the French attack of October 24 broke out the 14th Division went\r\ninto action north of Douaumont on the 27th.\r\n\r\n6. On December 16 it suffered the shock of the French offensive and had\r\nto be retired at the end of the month, very much weakened (65 per cent\r\ncasualties).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. After a month behind the Verdun front the 14th Division once more\r\ntook over its former sector at the beginning of February, 1917, on the\r\nleft bank of the Meuse, north of Chattancourt (Cumieres, Mort Homme).\r\n\r\n2. Relieved between April 14 and 20, it entrained between the 21st and\r\nthe 25th at Sivry sur Meuse and Vilosnes and was transferred to the\r\nAisne.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n3. After a few days of rest in the Marchais area, at Sissonne Camp, it\r\nwas brought back to the front, and on May 5 reenforced the sector\r\nbetween Ailles and Hurtebise, which was being held by guard divisions\r\nvery much weakened by our attacks.\r\n\r\n4. From May 7 to 12 it replaced the 1st Guard Division in line (west of\r\nHurtebise) and then was sent to rest east of Laon. It remained in\r\nreserve, not taking part in any action as an entire division.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest in the area northwest of Liesse, it came back into line\r\nin the sector Ailles-Hurtebise (June 20, 21) and there, on the 25th,\r\nunderwent the French attack. It lost the Cave of the Dragon; the 57th\r\nInfantry Regiment lost 191 prisoners.\r\n\r\n6. On July 26 the 14th Division attacked between Hurtebise and La\r\nBovelle. Its efforts to regain the positions lost were futile. On Aug. 1\r\nthe 1st Battalion of the 56th Infantry Regiment was commanded by a first\r\nlieutenant (document).\r\n\r\n7. At the end of July, very much weakened by its losses, it was sent to\r\nrest in the Vervins area and reconstituted (principally by men of the\r\n1918 class from the Bevelloo Camp). Between December 21, 1916, and\r\nAugust, 1917, no less than 326 men came as replacements to the 9th\r\nCompany of the 56th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n8. On September 17 the 14th Division came back into line in the Laffaux\r\narea, underwent our attacks on October 23, suffered heavy losses from\r\nour preparation fire, and left to the French the greater part of its\r\nartillery and numerous prisoners (1,763 men and 43 officers).\r\n\r\n9. An eye witness reckons the number of infantrymen left after the\r\nbattle at not more than 1,400 (letter). It was filled up with returned\r\nwounded, men borrowed from Landsturm battalions of the 11th Corps\r\nDistrict and men coming from the Russian front.\r\n\r\n10. After being thus reorganized, in the Vervins area, the division was\r\nsent to Haye in the Flirey sector, where it was engaged from the 5th of\r\nNovember on. It was relieved January 13, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Division is recruited principally from the Rhine districts of\r\nthe 7th Corps District, and it is for this reason that it is called\r\n“Troops from the Lower Rhine” in the German communiques of July 27,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nThis region, very populous, suffices for its own recruiting. It is to be\r\nnoticed, however, that in the course of the year 1917, in spite of the\r\ngrowing tendency to emphasize the sectional character of the large\r\nunits, the 14th Division received replacement troops from other\r\ndistricts besides the seventh; in May, men from the 6th Corps District\r\ntrained in the fourth (class of 1918); in August, men from the third,\r\nfourth, and eighth (class of 1918); in October, Pomeranians from the 22d\r\nLandwehr Division. The seventh district hardly counts except in the\r\nreplacements of October, with convalescents and men from the Westphalian\r\nLandsturm battalions. The heavy losses suffered since December, 1916\r\nwould explain, to a certain extent, this falling off in numbers. It may\r\nalso be that the morale of an industrial region such as Westphalia had\r\nbeen sufficiently shattered to make a mixture advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the French offensive of December 15, 1916, the 14th Division\r\nbehaved very well.\r\n\r\nSouth of Ailles (at the end of June, 1917) it attempted to regain lost\r\nground with great tenacity.\r\n\r\nIt put up a strong resistance to the attacks of October 23.\r\n\r\n“The 14th Division is a good division. It has just been withdrawn from a\r\nquiet sector to take part in a war of movement. It is a division\r\ndestined to attack.” (Jan. 18, 1918—note from the 1st French Army.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 14th Division was relieved in the Flirey sector (east of St.\r\nMihiel) by the 78th Reserve Division during the night of January 13–14.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. After having gone through some maneuvers in the region of Mars la\r\nTour the division entrained at that place (also Chambley) on March 27\r\nand detrained at St. Quentin on the 29th. It remained in support for a\r\nfew days and then reenforced the battle front west of Moreuil (northwest\r\nof Montdidier) on April 4. The same day attacked Rouvrel, but could make\r\nno progress. It suffered severely, and was withdrawn on the 11th, very\r\nmuch exhausted, to rest in the region of Bohain, where it was\r\nreconstituted, and went into intensive training for open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On May 27 the division entrained at Bohain, and detrained to the west\r\nof Laon, where it assembled in the forest of Coucy, and followed the\r\noffensive of the Aisne in the second line. It crossed the Aisne on May\r\n30, and marched via Crécy au Mont to Hautebraye. Its objective was Vic\r\nsur Aisne, but it was completely checked with heavy losses. It was\r\nwithdrawn about June 11.\r\n\r\n4. On June 14 it relieved the 51st Reserve Division near St. Bandry\r\n(southwest of Soissons). It was badly shattered in the fighting that\r\nfollowed and was withdrawn about July 2.\r\n\r\n5. On July 16 the division reinforced the front near Osly-Courtil (north\r\nof the Aisne—west of Soissons); it was withdrawn about the 26th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. During the night of September 18–19 the division relieved the 3d\r\nGuard Division southeast of Auberive; it was withdrawn about October 12\r\nand went to rest in the area north of Rethel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLESMES.\r\n\r\n7. The division marched by easy stages, and entered line near\r\nEnglefontaine (east of Solesmes) during the night of October 25–26. It\r\nwas still in line at the time of the signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Division is rated as being in the second of four classes.\r\nDespite its two training periods (March and May), it did not distinguish\r\nitself on the offensive, being decidedly checked at Moreuil and\r\nHautebraye. On the defensive, however, it fought tenaciously; it\r\nsuffered heavy losses, the regiments being reduced to three companies.\r\nThere is evidence supporting the view that there were not more than\r\n1,800 rifles in the division the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         14th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │27 Res.  │16 Res.  │27 Res.  │16 Res.  │27 Res.  │16 Res.\r\n              │         │53 Res.  │         │53 Res.  │         │53 Res.\r\n              │28.      │39 Fus.  │28.      │39 Fus.  │         │159.\r\n              │         │159.     │         │159.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │8 Res.

The 14th Reserve Division belongs, like the 13th Reserve Division, to\r\nthe 7th Reserve Corps. It was formed from the Reserve Brigade at the\r\nSenne Camp and from one brigade, surplus, of the 14th active division\r\n(28th Brigade). One regiment of this brigade, the 39th Fusiliers, from\r\nDusseldorf, appeared in front of Liege on August 8, while the rest of\r\nthe division was being assembled at Dueren.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUBEUGE.\r\n\r\n2. Entering into Belgium by way of Verviers, on August 16, the 14th\r\nReserve Division then formed a part of the 2d German Army. It was in\r\nfront of Namur on August 21, with the reserve corps of the Guard and the\r\n11th Corps. After Namur was taken it went to invest Maubeuge with the\r\n13th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Set free on September 7 by the fall of this place, it left on the\r\n10th to strengthen the Aisne front. About the 13th of September it\r\noccupied the heights around Cerny-en-Laonnois.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector between Cerny and Craonne (north of\r\nPaissy) until the beginning of November, 1915. In March it gave the 39th\r\nFusiliers to the 50th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. About November 2 it was transferred to the Charleroi area where it\r\nrested and had further training.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of December it was sent north of Verdun, near Romagne sous\r\nles Cotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. In January and until February 20, 1916, it was employed in works\r\npreparatory to the attack (Damvillers area).\r\n\r\n2. On February 23 it was in line on the right bank of the Meuse. It took\r\npart, from the very beginning, in the German offensive against Verdun,\r\nattacked Samogneux, Poivre Hill, and the Hill of Talou and\r\nVacherauville. (On the 3d of April, the 11th Company of the 16th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment had already received more than 118 men as\r\nreplacements. On May 14, at least 153 had been sent to the 8th Company\r\nof the 53d Infantry Reserve Regiment.)\r\n\r\n3. Until the end of December the 14th Reserve Division occupied this\r\nsector (of the Meuse (Champneuville) at Poivre Hill). On December 15, it\r\nunderwent the French counteroffensive, to the west of Douaumont, which\r\ncaused it to suffer very heavy losses. Then it took over the sector of\r\nHill 344 for one week.\r\n\r\n4. The division was relieved from December 22–25, concentrated in the\r\nDamvillers area and transferred to Champagne where it was reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. On January 1, 1917, it went into line north of Prunay and remained in\r\nthis sector (quiet) until October 22–25.\r\n\r\n2. In May the division sent some of its elements as reenforcements to\r\nunits attacked at Cornillet and at Monthaut.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORET DE COUCY.\r\n\r\n3. It entrained on October 26 at Chatelet and was transferred to the\r\narea of Cerny-en-Laonnois. On the 28th it was interpolated between two\r\ndivisions (the 10th Division and the 27th Division) on the front\r\nBassoles-Fresnes, in the upper Coucy wood, which it occupied until the\r\nmiddle of February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Reserve Division is recruited from Westphalia. As it suffered\r\nvery little in 1917, the division probably did not receive in the course\r\nof that year the heterogeneous replacements which were sent—perhaps\r\nintentionally—to the other Westphalian divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Reserve Division did not participate in any important action in\r\nthe course of the year 1917. It was thoroughly reorganized during its\r\nlong stay in Champagne. It is composed for the most part of young men\r\n(20 to 30 years of age) and has suffered but few losses (a slight\r\nproportion of the 1918 class).\r\n\r\nIts valor has not been put to any serious test since Verdun. It appears\r\ncapable of serious effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n1. The division was withdrawn from line in the St. Gobain region and\r\nwent to rest in the neighborhood of Laon. It was trained in open warfare\r\nduring the weeks that followed.\r\n\r\n2. On March 16 some equipment belonging to the 53d Reserve Regiment was\r\nfound west of Laon, near Champs, but it is unlikely that the division\r\nwas in line there; it was not identified in any other way. It was\r\nidentified in line in that region, however, on the 6th of April. It was\r\nwithdrawn on May 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division went immediately to the Aisne battle front, where it was\r\nidentified by prisoners in the Vierzy sector (south of Soissons) on May\r\n31. It was withdrawn about the 10th of June and rested for a month in\r\nthe region of Fere en Tardenois.\r\n\r\n4. On July 8 it relieved the 47th Reserve Division near Chavigny (south\r\nof Soissons). The 47th Reserve Division relieved part of the 14th\r\nReserve Division on the 12th, and the 14th Reserve seems to have come\r\nback in its entirety on the 16th. During this fighting, the division\r\nlost more than 1,500 prisoners. It was withdrawn on July 20, and went to\r\nrest and refit in the neighborhood of Mulhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nNESLE.\r\n\r\n5. The division entrained on the 22d of August at Birnsweiler and\r\ntraveled via Saarbruecken-Trier-Herbesthal-Liége-Namur-Charleroi-Condé,\r\ndetraining at Tincourt the night of August 23–24. On the 26th it\r\nreinforced the front near Thilloy (southwest of Nesle). It was withdrawn\r\non September 9, after losing some 1,300 prisoners, and went to rest in\r\nAlsace in the neighborhood of Oltingen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. On October 9, it reinforced the front near Orfeuil (southwest of\r\nVouziers).\r\n\r\n7. On October 28, the division was moved eastward to Boult, so as to\r\nhelp to hinder the American advance. It was still in line on November\r\n11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAfter the division’s participation in the battle of the Aisne, Lieut.\r\nGen. Loeb, its commander, was awarded the order Pour le Mérite. Again,\r\nthe German communiqué of September 2 spoke highly of the fighting of the\r\n56th Reserve Regiment. A captured regimental order mentions the fact\r\nthat there had been many cases of the grippe. The division suffered such\r\nsevere losses that most of the men from the 47th Reserve Division,\r\ndissolved in July, were sent to it. Nevertheless, the battalions were\r\nreduced to three companies in August. Despite its subsequent heavy\r\nlosses (the 159th Regiment was reduced to 600 men, and the other\r\nregiment to about the same size), the division is still considered as\r\nbeing first class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        14th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │21 Ldw.       │10 Ldw.       │21 Ldw.       │10 Ldw.\r\n              │              │38 Ldw.       │              │38 Ldw.\r\n              │              │101 Ldw.      │46 Ldw.       │101 Ldw.\r\n              │              │103 Ldw.      │              │103 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │93 Cav.

The 14th Landwehr Division appeared in Poland about the middle of\r\nJuly, 1915, in the Sierpec area.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be made up at this time of the 21st Mixed Brigade of\r\nLandwehr (10th and 38th Landwehr Regiments, taken from the Breslau\r\nCorps), elements of the Graudenz Corps, the 46th Landwehr Brigade (Pfeil\r\nBrigade—101st and 103d Landwehr Regiments). At all events, the 14th\r\nLandwehr Division does not appear to have received its complete\r\ncoherence until the stabilization of the front which followed the summer\r\noffensive against the Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n2. The division then took position in the Smorgoni sector (September).\r\nIt remained there until February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In 1916 the division remained in the Smorgoni sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In 1917 the division remained in the Smorgoni sector.\r\n\r\n2. About the month of April, 1917, the 101st and 103d Landwehr Regiments\r\n(Saxon) were taken from the 14th Landwehr Division and assigned to the\r\n46th Landwehr Division, a new formation on the Eastern Front. They were\r\nreplaced in the 14th Landwehr Division by the 346th Regiment, which\r\nformerly belonged to the 87th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is of mediocre value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINSK.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1918 the 14th Landwehr Division was still on the\r\nSmorgoni front, which it left about the middle of February to march\r\nfarther toward the east. “We are advancing right into Russia,” wrote a\r\nman of the 38th Landwehr Regiment on March 7. About the middle of March\r\nthe division went into cantonment in the vicinity of Orcha and Kochanovo\r\non the Minsk-Smolensk Railroad. It was still there at the end of April.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to France during May, the 14th Landwehr Division arrived in\r\nAlsace with only two regiments, the 10th and 38th Landwehr Regiments.\r\nThe division seems to have been dissolved soon afterwards, the 10th\r\nLandwehr seeming to be attached to the 301st Division and the 38th\r\nLandwehr to the 4th Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n3. The latter part of June the division was reconstituted on the Russian\r\nfront after the departure of these two regiments for the West, with the\r\nfollowing units: 103d Landwehr (from the 46th Landwehr Division), 343d\r\nErsatz (from the 87th Division), and the 3d Landsturm (14th Landwehr\r\nDivision). On the 30th of July the division was identified in the Orcha\r\nregion. Late in September the division was identified in the same\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        14th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[11]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.\r\n              │         │8 Bav.   │         │8 Bav.   │         │8 Bav.\r\n              │         │29 Bav.  │         │25 Bav.  │         │25 Bav.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │4 Sqn. 8 Bav.

The 14th Bavarian Division, going into line at the end of August,\r\n1916, in the Vaux Chapitre wood, launched a violent attack on September\r\n3 to the southwest of the fort of Vaux and continued to hold this sector\r\nuntil October 10.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October, the 29th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, whose losses\r\nin the Vaux sector were considerable, was dissolved and replaced by the\r\n25th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, taken from the 192d Division, and\r\nraised from two to three battalions.\r\n\r\n2. Having thus received its present composition, the 14th Bavarian\r\nDivision went back into line on the Haute de Meuse (Calonne trench) on\r\nOctober 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME-ANCRE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the beginning of November and sent to rest, it was then\r\nsent to the Somme, where, about November 26, it took over the sector\r\nnorth of the Ancre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 14th Bavarian Division left the Ancre front at the end of\r\nJanuary, 1917, passed the month of February at rest in the Denain area,\r\nand came back into line on the Somme, northeast of Gueudecourt, on\r\nFebruary 26. It was withdrawn on March 20 at the time of the German\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of April it went into action against the British\r\noffensive in the Roclincourt (north of Arras) and suffered heavily\r\n(about 2,800 prisoners on Apr. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-RIGA.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest in Belgium, it remained for several days in the Ghent\r\narea, and then entrained for the Eastern Front (Apr. 26–28). About May\r\n14 it went into line near Lipsk (south of Baranovitchi); in June it took\r\nover the sector of Tsirin, where it remained until the end of the\r\nAugust. It was then transferred to the Riga front (Sept. 1) and went\r\ninto action on September 14 in the neighborhood of Uxkuell. It left\r\nthere on September 18.\r\n\r\n4. About September 20 it went into line west of Jakobstadt and took part\r\nin the action of the 21st.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of October the 14th Bavarian Division was sent to Galicia.\r\nIt was identified in the neighborhood of Tarnopol on November 1 and, for\r\nthe last time, on December 14 (fraternizing).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n6. The division left the Tarnopol area on December 19 for the Western\r\nFront. Itinerary: Posen-Leipzig-Frankfort-Kreuznach-Thionville. It\r\ndetrained at Wasigny and Saulces-Monclin (near Rethel) on December 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Bavarian Division is recruited from the 2d and 3d Bavarian\r\nCorps Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe 8th Bavarian Brigade (4th and 8th Bavarian Infantry Regiments),\r\nwhich helped form the 14th Bavarian Division, is a strong body\r\nbelonging, in peace times, to the garrison at Metz.\r\n\r\nIt distinguished itself at the battle of Eparges (March-April, 1915), at\r\nthe attack of September 3, 1916 (Vaux-Chapitre wood).\r\n\r\nThe morale of the 14th Bavarian Division appears to be high. No deserter\r\nhas been found since the arrival of the division on the Western Front\r\n(December, 1917). The 14th Bavarian Division has always been a good\r\ndivision (January, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 14th Bavarian Division embarked at Tarnopol on December 19 and\r\ntraveled via Kalicz-Posen-Leipsic-Frankfort-Kreusnach-Thionville-\r\nWassigny (north of Rethel), where it detrained on the 23d. On January 12\r\nit relieved the 7th Reserve Division in the Mont Haut sector. It was\r\nrelieved by the 80th Reserve Division on April 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 26th the division entrained at Neuflize, detraining on the\r\nfollowing day near Mericourt (northeast of St. Quentin). From there it\r\nmarched via Bellenglise-Vermand-Mons en Chaussee-Brie-Foucaucourt to\r\nFramerville. On May 3 it relieved the 208th Division in the Hangard\r\nsector (southeast of Amiens). It was relieved on the 21st by the 225th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n3. The division remained in close support, and relieved the 15th\r\nDivision one sector to the south on the 23d. It was withdrawn during the\r\nnight of June 20–21, and rested in rear of the front for over a month.\r\n\r\n4. About July 23, it relieved the 21st Division in the Castel sector\r\n(north of Hangard). In the fighting that followed the division suffered\r\nheavy losses, especially in the British attack of August 8. It was\r\nwithdrawn about the 13th in a badly shattered condition, it having lost\r\nsome 2,500 prisoners.\r\n\r\n5. It was in line again on the 29th northwest of Villers-Carbonnel\r\n(southwest of Peronne), and was withdrawn about the 2d of September.\r\nSoon thereafter, the 14th Bavarian Division was disbanded—the 4th\r\nBavarian went to the 4th Bavarian Division to replace the 5th Bavarian\r\nReserves (dissolved); the 8th Bavarian went to the 16th Bavarian\r\nDivision to replace the 21st Bavarian Reserves (dissolved); the 25th\r\nBavarian went to the 6th Bavarian Reserves Division to replace the 17th\r\nBavarian Reserves (dissolved). The commanding general and his staff were\r\nidentified at Malineson October 24, but there is nothing to show what\r\nthey were doing there, or where they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1918 the 14th Bavarian was always considered a first-class\r\ndivision. Since then, however, it seems to have fallen off somewhat; it\r\nwas not used in any of the German offensives, and it is significant that\r\na battalion of the 2d Bavarian Division was used in its sector (south of\r\nHailles) when it was desired to make a raid, and also that two of the\r\ndivisions receiving regiments when the 14th Bavarian was disbanded were\r\nsecond class. The division lost over 2,000 prisoners, including all\r\nthree regiment staffs and the staffs of several of the battalions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             15th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Infantry.    │29.      │25.      │29.      │25.      │Jan. to Aug., 1916.\r\n              │         │161.     │         │161.     │29.      │25.\r\n              │80.      │65.      │80.      │65.      │         │161.\r\n              │         │160.     │         │160.     │80.      │65.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │160.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │Aug. to Nov., 1916.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │186.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │160.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │389.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │    After Nov.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │69.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │160.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │389.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │7 Hus.

Upon mobilization, the 15th Division (Aix la Chapelle, Cologne, Bonn,\r\netc.) formed with the 16th Division an organic part of the 8th Army\r\nCorps and was in the 4th Army (Duke of Wuerttemberg).\r\n\r\n2. Temporarily detaching the 25th Infantry Regiment (Aix la Chapelle)\r\nfrom the corps at the siege at Liege, the 15th Division entered, on\r\nAugust 6, into Luxemburg, where it had been preceded by the 16th\r\nDivision (Treves). It entered into Belgian Luxemburg on the 19th and\r\n20th of August. Went into action on the 22d and 23d—Porcheresse, Graid,\r\nBièvre—and entered France on the 26th. While the 29th Brigade was\r\ncrossing the Meuse at Sedan the 80th entered at Mezieres. Again uniting\r\non the 30th, the 15th Division went through Champagne by way of Somme Py\r\nand Suippes and took part in the battle of the Marne at Vitry le\r\nFrancois. It then withdrew to Souain and Perthes, where it remained as a\r\nwhole until November.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. At this time the 29th Brigade was taken to the Ypres front until the\r\nend of December, at which date it went to the south of Alsace, making a\r\npart of the combined division of Fuchs. The separation of the two\r\nbrigades lasted until May, 1915. The 29th Brigade lost heavily in\r\nAlsace, where the 25th Infantry Regiment was reduced to 600 men on March\r\n26, 1915 (soldier’s notebook).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The 15th Division, in which the 29th Brigade was temporarily replaced\r\nby the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Brigade, remained in Champagne until the\r\nbeginning of April, 1915. At that date it went to reenforce the 3d\r\nBavarian Corps near St. Mihiel in the Ailly wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of May the 15th Division again had both its brigades (29th\r\nand 80th) and went into action at Artois until the middle of June. It\r\nsuffered heavy losses. The 161st Infantry Regiment lost 31 officers and\r\n1,653 men (official list of casualties).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. From June, 1915, until June, 1916, the 15th Division occupied various\r\nsectors of the Aisne: Vailly-Pommiers (end of July), Nouvron\r\n(September), Ste. Marguerite-Bucy le Long (October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. July, 1916, the 15th Division was transferred to the Somme. It took\r\npart in the battle and participated in the attack at Biaches, where it\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of August it again took over its sector, St. Marguerite-\r\nBucy le Long. Its composition was modified by the temporary loss of the\r\n160th Infantry Regiment, sent to the combined division of Dumrath\r\n(August), by the definite transfer of the 65th Infantry Regiment and the\r\n161st Infantry Regiment to the 185th Division, and of the 25th Infantry\r\nRegiment to the 208th Division.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of October it had received in exchange for the\r\nregiments transferred the 186th Infantry Regiment (temporarily) and the\r\n389th Infantry Regiment, a new formation (men taken from various Rhine\r\nregiments), and received the 160th Infantry Regiment again (the Dumrath\r\nDivision having been dissolved). It reappeared on the Somme front\r\n(Sailly-Saillisel), where it again suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of October it returned to the Aisne and occupied the\r\nsectors of Nuvron-Moulin sous Touvent. It was reorganized finally in\r\nNovember and received its definitive composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. About the middle of November the 15th Division was withdrawn from the\r\nfront, entrained after a few days’ rest, and transferred to the Eastern\r\nFront. It went into line north of Kisselin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1917, the division was in Transylvania (upper valley of\r\nthe Olta).\r\n\r\n2. In April it was in reserve at Vladimir-Volynski.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to the French front (entrained at Kovel, detrained at\r\nVigneulles, at the end of April), the division occupied the sector of\r\nVaux les Palameix (Meuse).\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of May it was relieved and sent (night of May 29–30) to\r\nthe Vauclerc Plateau and the Californie Plateau. On June 2 and 3 it took\r\npart in the violent attack upon these plateaus. It renewed these attacks\r\nupon July 3 and again suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was relieved on the night of July 8–9 and then sent to\r\nthe Lys area, from which it was transferred into the zone Richecourt-\r\nAvricourt. It was put in line (July 15) near Blamont.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. It was relieved about September 4, sent to rest in the Verdun area,\r\nand transferred to Belgium on October 7, where it was in action and\r\nsuffered heavily on the Ypres front (north of the Ypres-Menin road)\r\nuntil November 13.\r\n\r\n7. The division was then sent to the rear (area of Bruges-Knocke).\r\n\r\n8. It again went into line east of Ypres about December 18 (east of\r\nPasschendaele). In the middle of January, 1918, it was withdrawn from\r\nthis sector and sent to the Bruges area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Division is easily recruited from the populous districts of the\r\nRhine Provinces. In case of heavy losses and urgent necessity for\r\nreenforcements, the need has been felt for having recourse to the rest\r\nof the Rhine country in the widest sense of the word, that is to say,\r\nRhenish Hessia and the Grand Duchy of Baden, in return for\r\nreenforcements sent elsewhere. The frequence of the relation and the\r\ncommunity of interests which unites these regions assures the 15th\r\nDivision, under all circumstances, the advantages of regional\r\nhomogeneity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Division, in spite of the lack of success of its efforts, has\r\ngiven the impression of being a good division.\r\n\r\nOn June 2 and 3, 1917, the 69th Infantry Regiment and the 389th Infantry\r\nRegiment, attacked vigorously upon the casemates and Californie\r\nPlateaus. The 389th Infantry Regiment, especially, showed a great deal\r\nof dash in the course of these actions (July, 1917).\r\n\r\nThe division is composed, for the most part, of young and well trained\r\nelements; it has the experience gained from a very active sector\r\n(September, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. The division relieved the 25th Division east of Passchendaele on\r\nFebruary 10 and occupied the sector until February 20–25 when it moved\r\nsouth and took over the Zonnebeke sector from the 31st Division. About\r\nMarch 21, it was relieved by the 39th Division. It entrained at\r\nMuelebeke on the 23d and detrained at Mons en Pevele (north of Douai).\r\nFrom there it went by marches to Cambrai (31st), Sailly Saillisel, Bray\r\nsur Somme and Suzanne, and Caix (Apr. 7–12).\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On April 12 it was engaged in the Bois Senecat, northwest of Moreuil.\r\nDuring the French attack of the 18th the division lost 700 prisoners. It\r\nwas relieved about April 22.\r\n\r\n3. It rested until mid-May near Busigny. The 389th Regiment is known to\r\nhave received 600 men as a draft at this time. On May 18, the division\r\nreturned to line near Castel, and was engaged until May 22.\r\n\r\n4. It rested in the Somme area (at Rosieres en Santerse June 1, and\r\nPeronne on the 9th), until June 17 when it came into line before\r\nMoreuil. It suffered heavy losses during the French attack of the 17th\r\nbut continued in line until the 26th. It rested east of Roye in June and\r\nfrom the 3d to the 5th of July was in reserve south of Blerancourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE OISE-AISNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was engaged in the Nampcel-Autreches sector from July 5\r\nuntil August 22. It was pushed back to Caisnes (Aug. 18) and as a result\r\nof the French attack lost 1,880 prisoners.\r\n\r\n6. The division was moved to rest at Damvillers north of Verdun in early\r\nSeptember. On the 26th it left that place and marched to Flabas, east of\r\nthe Meuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. On September 26 the division was in line in the Bois des Caures. It\r\ncontinued to hold a sector in the region until the armistice. The last\r\nidentification was northwest of Ornes on November 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. Its heavy losses at Moreuil in\r\nJune and the ravages of the grippe in the summer lowered the morale. On\r\nthe other hand, a document of October 4 indicated that the division had\r\nbeen congratulated by the Kaiser for its “heroic conduct.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         15th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │25 Res.  │29 Res.  │25 Res.  │29 Res.  │25 Res.\r\n              │         │69 Res.  │         │69 Res.  │         │69 Res.\r\n              │         │17 Res.  │80 Res.  │17 Res.  │80 Res.  │17 Res.\r\n              │         │30 Res.  │         │30 Res.  │         │30 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │5 Res.

In August, 1914, the 15th Reserve Division which was a part of the\r\n8th Reserve Corps (with the 16th Reserve Division) and of the 4th Army,\r\nwas concentrated on the Luxemburg frontier, which it crossed on the\r\n19th. Entering Belgium on the 21st, it fought on the 22d at Maissin and\r\nPaliseul, and between the 25th and 27th it crossed the Meuse near Sedan,\r\nlosing heavily. On August 28, the 2d Battalion of the 69th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was reduced to 140 men (soldier’s notebook).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. From this place, by way of le Chesne, Vouziers, Tahure, the division\r\nadvanced as far as Marne Canal to the Rhine, at Vitry le Francois\r\n(Brusson Dompremy, Sept. 6), where it took part in the battle of the\r\nMarne.\r\n\r\n3. The division retired between September 9 and September 16 by way of\r\nSuippes to Servon, Binarville, Massiges (Sept. 18 to 27), and\r\nestablished itself north of Massiges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 15th Reserve Division occupied the front north of Massiges and of\r\nMesnil les Hurlus in the Souain area. In the course of various small\r\nactions, especially in May, it suffered heavily, so much so that by June\r\n30, the losses suffered since the beginning of the campaign amounted to\r\n2,316 men for the 2d Battalion of the 17th Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\n(official list of casualties).\r\n\r\n2. In September, 1915, the elements of the 15th Reserve Division divided\r\nbetween the Liebert Division (17th and 69th Reserve Infantry Regiments)\r\nand the Ditfurth Division (25th and 30th Reserve Infantry Regiments)\r\ntook part in the battle of Champagne near Tahure, east of Somme Py (from\r\nSept. 25 to the beginning of October). They suffered considerable\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of October the 15th Reserve Division was relieved from\r\nthe Tahure sector and reorganized. At the beginning of November it went\r\ninto line between Vailly and the Oise-Aisne Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division occupied the sector Chavonne-Soupir south of Braye en\r\nLaonnois until the end of June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July, as soon as the Franco-British offensive\r\nbegan, the 15th Reserve Division detached some of its elements to\r\nreenforce divisions engaged along the Somme, especially at Flaucourt\r\n(July 2 and 3), Hem wood, and the Vermandovillers area (August).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Some of these elements returned to the Aisne and were reassigned to\r\nthe Liebert (new 15th Reserve Division) and the Dumrath Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The 17th and 30th Reserve Infantry Regiments remained in the Somme\r\narea. Separated at first, at the end of August they formed the 32d\r\nBrigade reattached to the 35th Division which held the front in the area\r\nof Estrees-Ablaincourt (September).\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of October the 15th Reserve Division once more\r\nreorganized its original elements, and occupied the lines between\r\nFouquescourt and the north of Andechy.\r\n\r\n6. The division was relieved from the Somme front about December 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Once more in line in the Fouquescourt sector, the division took part\r\nin the German withdrawal by way of Ercheu, Moyencourt (Mar. 17), Ham\r\n(Mar. 19).\r\n\r\n2. It was sent to rest in the Maubeuge area (?) (end of March and\r\nApril).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. About May 2 it went into line in the Fresnoy sector (north of Arras),\r\nwhere it went into action about May 3.\r\n\r\n4. It was withdrawn from the Artois front on May 10 and transferred to\r\nthe Eastern Front (May 21 to May 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to Galicia, it occupied the sector south of Brzezany, where it\r\nunderwent the Russian attack of July 1. Then it took part in the\r\noffensive against the Russians at the end of July, and suffered heavy\r\nlosses near Husiatin, where it remained until August 24. Sent to the\r\nrear of Zbrucz it held this sector from September 15 to December 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n6. Relieved at this date, it remained in the Jablona area until December\r\n19, and entrained on the 30th for the Western Front.

It detrained on January 7, in the Dun\r\narea, where it went to rest.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Reserve Division suffered very heavy losses in Galicia (July\r\nand Aug., 1917).\r\n\r\nAt the end of February, 1918, these losses, according to the statements\r\nof deserters, had not yet been made good by sufficient replacements.\r\n\r\nIn Russia there was no exchange of the older men of the division for men\r\nof the 1919 class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Reserve Division is recruited from the Rhine districts in\r\ngeneral. The elements from the 9th Corps District, introduced by the\r\nassignment of one battalion of the 76th Landwehr Regiment to the 69th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment, have almost disappeared with the arrival of\r\nsuccessive replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. During its occupancy of the Verdun sector the division underwent\r\nintensive training which was to fit it for operations on the Western\r\nFront. It was relieved about April 15. The division commenced entraining\r\nat Stenay about April 23 and traveled via Givet-Dinant-Namur-Charleroi-\r\nBraine le Comte-Ath-Tournai, and detrained between Tournai and Lille.\r\nOne regiment marched to Haubourdin (12 miles), where it rested several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINGE.\r\n\r\n2. On the night of May 1–2 the division came into line east of St.\r\nVenant. It held this sector for 10 months. Toward the end of June it was\r\nrelieved by the 23d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n3. On July 11 the division entered the line southwest of Oppy. It was\r\nengaged at Gavrelle, Oppy, and Arleux until October 9 when the 187th\r\nDivision relieved it.\r\n\r\n4. The division returned to line on the 12th to reinforce the front east\r\nof Bohain and fought until the end of October in the region east of\r\nWassigny. There was some talk in the division of the dissolution, as no\r\ndrafts of importance were received during September or October.\r\n\r\n5. On November 6 the division was again in line. In the closing days of\r\nthe war it was engaged north of Beaurepaire, southeast of Limont-\r\nFontaine, southwest of Aites and Obrechies (10th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. During 1918 the division was\r\nalmost constantly in line holding defensive sectors, which it did with\r\nfair success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        15th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │10 Ldw.       │12 Ldw.       │10 Ldw.       │12 Ldw.\r\n              │              │52 Ldw.       │              │52 Ldw.\r\n              │27 Ldw.       │53 Ldw.       │27 Ldw.       │53 Ldw.\r\n              │              │55 Ldw.       │              │55 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Ldw.

The 15th Landwehr Division (Sack Division) was formed about the month\r\nof March, 1915, from two independent Landwehr brigades (the 10th and\r\n27th) which had been holding, since September, 1914, the sectors of the\r\nOise south of Noyon.\r\n\r\n2. The 10th Brigade, entering Belgium on August 19, was at Tirlemont on\r\nSeptember 1 and had been sent rapidly to the Oise at the beginning of\r\nthe retreat from the Marne. It had gone into action at Blerancourt,\r\nBellefontaine, Cuts, on September 15 and 16. The 27th Brigade, coming\r\nfrom Aix la Chapelle August 17, had advanced by way of Louvain, Douai,\r\nCambrai, Bepaume, and Amiens and had likewise been in action on\r\nSeptember 15 and 16 at Rivecourt and Nampcel.\r\n\r\n3. After its formation the 15th Landwehr Division continued to occupy\r\nthe Oise sector of Thiescourt (Ribecourt) until 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1.

The Oise sector of Thiescourt was held by the division until 1917.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March, 1917, the 15th Landwehr Division took part in\r\nthe withdrawal of the German troops and retired southeast of St. Quentin\r\nby way of Salency, Chauny, and La Fere.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved at the end of March, it was transferred to the Eastern\r\nFront. Itinerary: Charleroi-Luxemburg-Treves * * * Breslau-Cracow-\r\nLemberg. (Some elements of the division had already left before the\r\nwithdrawal to the Hindenburg line and had entrained at Noyon.)\r\n\r\n3. In Galicia the 15th Landwehr Division occupied the sector west of\r\nBrody until the beginning of 1918.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after its arrival the 52d Landwehr Regiment was\r\nwithdrawn from the division (April, 1917).\r\n\r\nLike the other Landwehr divisions on the Eastern Front, the 15th\r\nLandwehr Division at the end of 1917 had given its best elements to\r\ndivisions operating in France (especially to the 111th Division).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is purely a sector division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Early in March the 15th Landwehr Division marched toward Rovno; from\r\nthere it was transported to Kiev.\r\n\r\n2. On May 11 the division was south of Ekaterinoslav; the 12th Landwehr\r\nRegiment at Sebastopol and the 53d Landwehr Regiment likewise being in\r\nthe Crimea.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUCASUS.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of May elements of the division were identified in the\r\nKertch region, the 12th Landwehr Regiment, however, being on the Vardar\r\nfront. The division was still here the latter part of September.

From February 1 to March 1, 1917, the three regiments of the division\r\nreceived instruction for mountain troops in Upper Bavaria, near the\r\nAustrian frontier.\r\n\r\n2. On March 1 the 15th Bavarian Division was transferred to the\r\nCharleroi area, where it remained one month; there it received training\r\nin the war of movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of March it was transferred to Lorraine; it occupied the\r\nLeintrey sector (Parroy wood) until the beginning of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. From Lorraine it went to the Laonnois area (Sissonne, La Selve, May\r\n12); went into line southwest of Juvincourt on May 19–20; launched an\r\nattack on June 28–29 southeast of Corbeny, and left the front at the end\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest in the Sedan area the division entrained on August 20\r\nfor the Verdun front.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (HILL 304).\r\n\r\n6. Detraining at Stenay and Dun (Aug. 22–24), it went into line north of\r\nHill 304 (Forges Stream). The French attack on the 24th occasioned\r\nserious losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (RIGHT BANK).\r\n\r\n7. The 15th Bavarian Division was relieved from Hill 304 about October\r\n16; went from there to the right bank of the Meuse, and then into line\r\nat Beaumont (Oct. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Bavarian Division is recruited from all of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1917, the 15th Bavarian Division appeared strong.\r\n\r\nIn the 31st Bavarian Infantry Regiment two-thirds of the men were\r\nrecruits belonging to the 1918 class.\r\n\r\nThe division suffered few losses on the Verdun front after November,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. During the spring the division made use of the quiet Bezouvaux sector\r\nto train the men in machine gun and assault tactics. It was relieved on\r\nJuly 23 and rested south of Longwy (Villers la Montagne) until July 4.\r\nIt was moved to Sault St. Remy, by Carignan, Sedan, Rethel (July 4–5).\r\nUntil the 11th it rested in a camp, when it marched by night toward the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF RHEIMS.\r\n\r\n2. On the 15th it was engaged in the offensive east of Prunay. It\r\nadvanced to north of Thuizy, suffering very heavy losses, estimated to\r\nhave been 30 to 40 per cent. It remained in line until mid-August. After\r\n10 weeks’ rest the division was again engaged about September 1 north of\r\nProsnes until September 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was placed in line farther to the east, near Somme Py,\r\nwhere it remained until about September 29, at which time it was put in\r\nreserve north of Bouillon. In the fighting all three regiments were\r\nexhausted, but the losses of the 31st Bavarian Regiment were\r\nparticularly heavy. Six hundred prisoners were taken from the division\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested from October 5 to 10. At this time the 18th\r\nBavarian Reserve Regiment, from the disbanded Bavarian Ersatz Division,\r\nwas divided among the three regiments of the division.\r\n\r\n5. It came into line on October 13 east of Grandpre and was engaged on\r\nthe United States front until November 11. It did not offer a vigorous\r\nresistance to the American attacks at first, but in late October and\r\nearly November it did all in its power to check the American advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a third-class. The heavy losses in Champagne\r\nin September and October, the prevalent sickness, political discontent,\r\nand dissatisfaction with Prussia continued to give the division a low\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             16th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │30.      │28.      │30.      │28.      │30.      │28.\r\n              │         │68.      │         │68.      │         │68.\r\n              │31.      │29.      │31.      │29.      │31.      │29.\r\n              │         │69.      │         │69.      │         │69.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │8 Cuirassier Rgt.  │                   │8 Cuirassier Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │  (3 and 4 Sqns.).\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │16 Brig.:          │16 Brig.:          │16 Brig.:\r\n              │ 23 F.

In August, 1914, the 16th Division (belonging to the 8th Army Corps,\r\ntogether with 16th Division) was a part of the 4th German Army (Duke of\r\nWurttemberg). It entered Luxemburg at the beginning of August (28th\r\nInfantry Regiment), there received the rest of its reservists on the\r\n7th, entered Belgian Luxemburg on the 20th, and went into action on the\r\n23d at Bièvre and Gédinne. From there, by way of Sedan and Donchery\r\n(Aug. 26), forming the extreme right of the 4th Army, it went through\r\nChampagne, reached Suippes on September 3, and crossed the Marne near\r\nVitry le François, where it came into contact with the French forces. It\r\nretired, having suffered heavily, by way of Somme-Yèvre—Herpont-St. Mard\r\nsur Auve-Somme Bionne, and stopped near Perthes les Hurlus, where it\r\nmade a stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. The 16th Division occupied the sector Souain-Perthes during the\r\nwinter of 1914 and 1915; it there withstood strong attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. In November and December, 1914, the division detached certain of its\r\nelements (31st Brigade, 29th and 69th Infantry Regiments) in Belgium, in\r\nthe Langemarck area.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of December the 31st Brigade was sent to Alsace for\r\nwork near Mulhouse. It formed a part of the Fuchs Division, was in line\r\nnorth of Thann and rejoined the 30th Brigade opposite Perthes at the end\r\nof December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Champagne front about April 18–19, 1915, the 16th\r\nDivision was sent to rest in the Briey area, then transferred, about May\r\n15, north of Arras.\r\n\r\n2. It lost very heavily at Souchez and Neuville-St. Vaast, withstanding\r\nthe offensive of May. The 69th Infantry Regiment lost 42 officers and\r\n1,609 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division left Artois in the middle of June and, after a few days\r\nof rest near St. Quentin, went into line in the middle of July, east of\r\nSoissons (Chavonne-Soupir sector).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOUVRON.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of October it took over the sector of Nouvron, west of\r\nSoissons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 16th Division remained on the Aisne front until the end of July,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Entraining at Folembray, it was transferred to Ham and Nesle. After a\r\nshort stay in the Maucourt sector (northwest of Roye) at the beginning\r\nof August, it took part in the battle of the Somme near Pozières-\r\nThiepval, where it suffered very heavy losses (Aug. 10–24); the 3d\r\nCompany of the 29th Infantry Regiment lost 131 men at Pozières (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\nBERRY AU BAC.\r\n\r\n3. In September the reorganized 16th Division (especially with men of\r\nthe 1917 class) occupied a quiet sector west of Berry au Bac. In October\r\nthe 69th Infantry Regiment was withdrawn from the 16th Division, which\r\nnow has three regiments (30th Brigade).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved about the 3d of October from the sector west of Berry au\r\nBac, the division entrained at Laon and was transferred to the Somme. It\r\nwent into line (Lesboeufs-Sailly-Saillisel) on October 9 and suffered\r\nheavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. On October 26 the division left the Somme, returned for a few days\r\n(Nov. 5–16) to the front northwest of Soissons and entrained for Russia\r\non November 20. Itinerary: Liege-Aix la Chapelle-Dusseldorf-Hanover-\r\nMagdeburg-Berlin-Skernewitzy-Warsaw-Brest- Litowsk-Kovel-Turisk. It\r\ndetrained on November 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. On the Russian front the 16th Division occupied the Kiselin sector,\r\nsouth of Kovel (until the beginning of May, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. On May 17, entraining near Kieslin, the division returned to France\r\nvia Vladimir Volynski-Kovel-Brest Litowsk-Warsaw-Kalich-Cottbus-Leipzig-\r\nCassel-Coblentz-Gerolstein-Sedan-Attigny, where it detrained on May 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. After a rest at Ecordal, on June 4 the division was sent to Flanders.\r\nDetraining at Orchies, it marched to Wambrechies; it there remained for\r\n12 days. On June 26 it went into line at Warneton, where the British\r\nattack of July 31 did not cause it any serious losses.\r\n\r\n4. About the 23d of September the 16th Division was sent to rest in the\r\nBruges area.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of October it was sent to the Ypres front.\r\n\r\nSome elements were engaged on October 3 and 4 against the British\r\nattacks east of Zonnebeke. On October 6 the division went to the\r\nsoutheast of Poelcappelle and supported the local offensives, against\r\nthe British troops (Oct. 9–12).\r\n\r\nThe 16th Division remained behind the front from October 12 to November\r\n24.\r\n\r\nAt this date it took over the sector north of Becelaere and a short time\r\nafterwards that of Passchendaele (east), where it was relieved about the\r\nmiddle of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Division is recruited almost exclusively from the Rhine\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nBefore being engaged on the Somme the 16th Division had gained a\r\nwonderful reputation. It was known as the “Iron Division.” In the battle\r\nof the Somme it did not, however, distinguish itself in any way.\r\n\r\nAt Warneton and at Ypres (June and October, 1917) it fought stubbornly\r\nin spite of its heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. The division was at rest in Belgium (Meulebeke area) until about\r\nMarch 1, when it was engaged east of Passchendaele until March 23.\r\n\r\n2. It entrained at Pitthem and moved to reserve at Tourcoing until April\r\n4. Later it was at Lille until April 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n3. The division was engaged on April 4 north of Neuve Chapelle and south\r\nof Merville on the 12th. On the 17th the 68th Regiment was to attack but\r\nwas unable to do so through weakness and lack of food. Two regimental\r\ncommanders were included in the heavy casualties. It was relieved east\r\nof St. Venant on May 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested in Belgium (Braine, south of Brussels) for about\r\ntwo weeks. On the 19th it was in line southwest of Merville. It was\r\nrelieved by the 25th Division on the night of July 6–7. After 10 days’\r\nrest the division returned to its former sector and continued in line\r\nuntil August 18.\r\n\r\n5. After leaving the line on August 18 it rested near Haubourdin until\r\nthe 26th, when it entrained for Raches (north of Douai). It marched\r\ntoward the front east of Arras by Douai and Vitry, entering the line\r\nnear Vis en Artois on August 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n6. The division fought near Dury and Hendecourt until mid-September,\r\nlosing more than 1,500 prisoners. It rested at Bruges until its return\r\nto line north of Lens on September 26. It was driven back toward Pont a\r\nVendin and Courrieres, northwest of Orchies, Hollain, and Antoing. The\r\ndivision was withdrawn about November 6 from the Antoing area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a second-class division. During 1918 it fought\r\nentirely on the British front, chiefly on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         16th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │29 Res.  │28 Res.  │29 Res.  │28 Res.  │29 Res.  │28 Res.\r\n              │         │68 Res.  │         │68 Res.  │         │68 Res.\r\n              │31 Res.  │29 Res.  │31 Res.  │29 Res.  │31 Res.  │29 Res.\r\n              │         │65 Res.  │         │65 Res.  │         │65 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │   Feb. to July.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │28 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │68 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │25 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │   Aug. to Sept.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │190.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │68 Res.  │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │Hippe\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Rgt.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │   Sept. to Dec.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │190.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │29 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │390.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Heavy Res.

Entering\r\nChampagne by way of Vouziers, it took part in the battle of the Marne,\r\nalong the canal from the Marne to the Rhine (Heiltz le Maurupt-\r\nBignicourt-Le Buisson).\r\n\r\n3. On September 9 it began its retreat, and retired by way of Suippes\r\n(Sept. 14) to Cernay en Dormois. About September 20 it stopped in the\r\narea of Minaucourt-Massiges and took up its position there.\r\n\r\n4. The 16th Reserve Division occupied this sector of Champagne (north of\r\nMassiges) until the month of October, 1915. (On the 30th of January,\r\n1915, the 29th Reserve Infantry Regiment had had a total of 79 officers\r\nand 3,090 men casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. At the time of the French offensive in Champagne the 16th Reserve\r\nDivision went into battle east of the road from Tahure to Perthes les\r\nHurlus (Sept. 25). It was then a part of a new group under the orders of\r\nGen. Ditfurth.\r\n\r\n2. Having suffered heavily from these attacks, the 16th Reserve Division\r\nwas relieved about October 15 and sent to the rest in the Chesne area.\r\nBetween October 8 and 14 no less than 223 men came to the 5th Company of\r\nthe 68th Reserve Infantry Regiment as replacements (in this number,\r\nrecruits of the 1915 class who had had four months’ instruction).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of October the 16th Reserve Division was sent north of the\r\nAisne, where it took over the sector between Soissons and Vailly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 16th Reserve Division remained in line east of Soissons until\r\nFebruary 16, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of February it went to the west of Soissons, in the\r\nsector of Moulin sous Touvent-Autreches, which it occupied until the\r\nmonth of October.\r\n\r\n3. In February the 16th Reserve Division lost two of its regiments, the\r\n65th and 29th Reserve Infantry Regiments, which were replaced by a\r\nsingle regiment, the 35th Reserve Infantry Regiment. It was then\r\ncomposed of the 25th, 28th, and 68th Reserve Infantry Regiments.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of the battle of the Somme, July 2, the 25th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment (2 battalions) was sent by itself as a reinforcement\r\nin the Barelaux area. The 28th Reserve Infantry Regiment left the 16th\r\nReserve Division at the end of July to be attached to the 185th\r\nDivision, likewise on the Somme.\r\n\r\n5. The 16th Reserve Division, composed of the 68th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment and of two other regiments, the 190th Infantry Regiment and the\r\nProvisional Hippe Regiment, continued to occupy the sector of Moulin\r\nsous Touvent (August).\r\n\r\n6. The 68th Reserve Infantry Regiment in its turn was sent to the Somme.\r\nIt went into action near Deniécourt (September-October). One may\r\ncalculate its losses by the fact that the 5th Company received at least\r\n55 men as replacements between October 2 and 6.\r\n\r\n7. The 16th Reserve Division then comprised the 29th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment, once more attached to the division, the 190th Infantry\r\nRegiment, and the 390th Infantry Regiment, which replaced the Hippe\r\nRegiment above mentioned. Thus constituted, it was retained in the area\r\nMoulin sous Touvent-Autreches until the month of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n8. Relieved on October 15, it entrained at Tergnier and was transferred\r\nto the Somme. It took part in the St. Pierre-Vaast wood in local\r\noperations, in the course of which it suffered heavily (Nov. 4 to 28).\r\n\r\n9. About December 12 the 16th Reserve Division was sent north of the\r\nAisne. It went into line in the Cerny en Laonnois area.\r\n\r\nAt this time the division was once more reorganized. It again received\r\nthe 68th Reserve Infantry Regiment, which came back from the Somme. The\r\n190th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 47th Division, and the\r\n390th Infantry Regiment, which was assigned to the 211th Division, was\r\nreplaced by the 30th Reserve Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. With this composition (29th, 68th, and 30th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiments) the 16th Reserve Division occupied the sector of Cerny en\r\nLaonnois from January to April, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. It underwent the French offensive of April 16 between Chivy and the\r\nCerny sugar refinery, where it suffered very heavily (1,100 prisoners).\r\n\r\n3. Relieved on the Aisne front about April 20, the division was sent to\r\nthe Sissonne Camp, where it was reorganized (beginning of May).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. About May 10 it went into line between the Sanon and Gondrexon, in\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was sent to Alsace about June 20 and remained in the\r\nFerette area, where its training was vigorously carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n6. On July 7, 1917, the 16th Reserve Division entrained for the Eastern\r\nFront.\r\n\r\n7. Detraining on the 12th in the area of Rohatyn-Bourchtyn (Galicia), it\r\nwent into action on the 15th near Halucz, along the Dneister, and\r\nreached Khotin, where the Russian retreat halted.\r\n\r\n8. At the end of August it occupied a new sector north of Bojan, east of\r\nCzernowitz (taking of Bojan, Aug. 27).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n9. The 16th Reserve Division was withdrawn from the front about November\r\n15 and entrained for France near Czernowitz (Nov. 20). Itinerary:\r\nKolomea-Stanislau-Lemberg-Przeymsl-Cracow-Oppeln-Breslau-Dresden-\r\nChemnitz-Nuremberg-Karlsruhe-Haguenau-Saareguemines-Thionville-Sedan-\r\nBucy les Pierrepont, where it detrained on November 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n10. Going into action southwest of Cambrai (Marcoing) on December 6, it\r\nwas still in this sector at the beginning of March, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Reserve Division is recruited from the Rhine Province and all\r\nthe Rhine districts. Thus, in October, 1916, it received men from the\r\nmining district of Westphalia, and also in March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Reserve Division was a good division. It was very much\r\nexhausted on April 16 and 17, 1917, in the Cerny sector. During this\r\naction the 30th Reserve Infantry Regiment was remarkable for its\r\ndesperate resistance and had only 50 prisoners taken.\r\n\r\nDuring its stay in Lorraine (May and June, 1917) the 16th Reserve\r\nDivision maintained a purely defensive attitude. The losses suffered on\r\nthe Aisne and the nature of the replacements received appear to have\r\nsensibly diminished the combat value of the 30th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1917, on the Galician front, the 16th Reserve Division was\r\nconsidered incapable of participating in active operations because of\r\nthe large proportion of older men and the weakness of its effectives\r\n(according to prisoners’ statements).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division attacked on March 21 south of Marcoing. It was taken out\r\non the 3d day of the offensive and sent to rest in the Ancre area. About\r\nApril 10 the division relieved the 107th Division on the Ancre and held\r\na sector until the 107th Division returned and relieved on April 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested near Puisieux until May 15, when it entered the\r\nline northwest of Beaumont Hamel and remained until about June 15. It\r\nrested in the neighborhood of Haplincourt until about July 4, when it\r\nreturned to the Beaumont-Hamel sector. The British attack in August\r\nforced the division to retire through Muraumont (23d), Grandcourt\r\n(24th), Le Barque (25th), and Flers (27th). It was withdrawn on August\r\n28, after suffering heavy losses.\r\n\r\n3. The division again came into line on September 5 north of Equancourt.\r\nIn five days’ fighting it lost 600 prisoners. On September 10 it went to\r\nrest in the Bruges area, where it was until October 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n4. On October 1 the division relieved the 16th Bavarian Division on the\r\nYpres battle front, southeast of Staden. Throughout October it was\r\nengaged at Hooglede, Staden, and near Wynghene. It was withdrawn on\r\nOctober 28 and remained out of line in the Ghent area until the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was engaged as a sector-\r\nholding unit in active fronts during 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        16th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │2 Ldw.        │3 Ldw.        │2 Ldw.        │3 Ldw.\r\n              │              │374 (Jacobi   │              │374.\r\n              │              │  Rgt.).      │              │\r\n              │              │379 Ldw.      │              │379 Ldw.\r\n              │              │  (Tietz      │              │\r\n              │              │  Rgt.).      │              │\r\n              │              │378 (3 C.     │              │\r\n              │              │  Dist.).     │              │\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │94 Cav.

The 16th Landwehr Division (Landwehr Division of Koenigsberg, Sommer\r\nDivision), providing the war garrison of Koenigsberg, took part in the\r\nbattles on the East Prussian frontier in October, 1914, with a few of\r\nits future elements (1st Ersatz Battalion of the 12th Landwehr\r\nRegiment).\r\n\r\nIt was in the region of Mariampol from April until the end of August,\r\n1915. It was identified in the Lipsk sector on August 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. After the summer offensive it was sent to the sector between Krevo\r\nand Smorgoni (September).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1.

Krevo-Smorgoni sector.\r\n\r\nOn July 22 and 23, 1917, the 16th Landwehr Division suffered very heavy\r\nlosses withstanding Russian attacks in this area.\r\n\r\nDuring the months which followed it gave its best elements to troops on\r\nthe Western Front or to those assigned to the Western Front. At the end\r\nof November 70 per cent of the men of the 379th Landwehr Regiment were\r\nbetween the ages of 40 and 47 years (Russian interrogatory).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Landwehr Division has always been on the Russian front.

The 16th Landwehr Division was still in line near Krevno in January.\r\nMoving then toward the east, it was near Orcha in April, and near\r\nKharkov early in May. The 346th Infantry Regiment, which had remained in\r\nRussia after the departure for France of the two other regiments of the\r\n14th Landwehr Division seems to have been attached to the 16th Landwehr\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA OF AZOV.\r\n\r\n2.

The 3d\r\nField Artillery Regiment came from the 6th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. On February 12, 1917, the 16th Bavarian Division replaced the 6th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division south of Lens, opposite Souchez. It suffered\r\nserious losses there in February and March (raids by Canadian troops).\r\nAfter a period of rest, in March, in the Douai area, the division\r\nreturned opposite Souchez and suffered in the British attack of April 9,\r\nwhich forced it back beyond Vimy Ridge. It was relieved on April 11,\r\nvery much exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS-MESSINES.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of April the 16th Bavarian Division took over the calm\r\nsector of Armentieres (East), south of the Lys (Deulemont-Frelinghien).\r\nAt the beginning of June, on account of the menace of the British attack\r\non the Messines front, the division was transferred north of the Lys.\r\nDuring the battle which started on June 9 it was not engaged as a whole;\r\nit sent some of its elements southeast of Messines to reenforce the 4th\r\nBavarian Division.\r\n\r\n3. The 16th Bavarian Division left the Lys sector, beginning of\r\nSeptember, to go into reserve near Dadizeele, east of Ypres.\r\n\r\n4. On September 20 it came up to replace the Bavarian Ersatz Division,\r\nwhich was very much exhausted by the British attack. It counterattacked\r\nnorth of the Lys. Its losses were such that it was relieved the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\n5. After a period of rest at Bruges, the 16th Bavarian Division occupied\r\nthe coast sector (Lombartzyde) from October 25 to November 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n6. Transferred to the Cambrai front, it went into line on December 3\r\n(Bullecourt-Queant) and launched a local attack on the 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Bavarian Division appears to be of good combat value. It may be\r\ncompared with the best Bavarian Divisions. It was very much exhausted at\r\nYpres in 1917, but in general its morale remained high.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division did not participate in the initial attack of March 21,\r\nbut remained in reserve of the front at Rumancourt. On the 23d it\r\nmarched toward the front through Vaulx Vraucourt. The division was\r\nengaged at Sapignies on March 25, and on the 27th advanced on\r\nGomiecourt, Courcelles, and Moyenneville. The division was relieved on\r\nApril 7 and rested until the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. It was reengaged south of the Scarpe, south of Feuchy, until May 19,\r\nwhen it moved north and took over a sector at Dranoutre. The route\r\nfollowed was through Cambrai-Tourcoing-Bousbecque. On June 20 it went\r\nout to rest in the Lille area until the beginning of July. It returned\r\nto its former sector on July 4 and remained there until the end of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. It rested in the Lille area until August 20, when it moved south and\r\nwas engaged west of Bapaume (Grevillers) in a German counterattack. It\r\nwas thrown back on Avesnes les Bapaume (26th), Bancourt (30th), Villers\r\nau Flos (1st), until its relief on September 5. Losses of the division\r\nwere heavy in this fighting.\r\n\r\n4. The division went into reserve in Belgium at Iseghem until the 28th.\r\nAt this time the 8th Bavarian Regiment, coming from the 14th Bavarian\r\nDivision, replaced the 21st Bavarian Reserve, which was disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF DIXMUDE.\r\n\r\n5. It was engaged north of Ypres and west of Roulers (Westroosebeke)\r\nfrom September 28 to October 5, with very heavy losses. The division was\r\nout of line for 10 days and then came back on the 15th southwest of\r\nThourout. The Belgium advance forced it back southeast of Bruges (Oct.\r\n18–19). On the 28th the division was relieved, but was obliged to return\r\nto line on November 3 and fought until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was engaged largely in\r\nholding defensive but active sectors on the British front in 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             17th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │33.      │75.      │33.      │75.      │34.      │75.\r\n              │         │76.      │         │76.      │         │89 Gren.\r\n              │34.      │89 Gren. │34.      │89 Gren. │         │90 Fus.\r\n              │         │90 Fus.  │         │90 Fus.  │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │16 Dragoon Rgt.

In October it took up the position near Bailly (from the Oise to east\r\nof St. Mard) and remained there until the middle of November, 1915. Some\r\nof its elements occupied the right bank of the Oise near Connectancourt\r\n(Oct. 5 to Dec. 25).\r\n\r\n4. November 17 it attacked Tracy le Val.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nFrom January to October, 1915, it held the sector on the left bank of\r\nthe Oise, east edge of the St. Mard wood. At the end of March the 76th\r\nInfantry Regiment was withdrawn and transferred to the 111th Division.\r\n\r\n1. June 14 to 16 certain elements of the division counterattacked at\r\nQuennevieres.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the sector of the Oise (about Oct. 15), the division\r\nwas transferred to Champagne. It occupied the front between the road\r\nSouain, Somme Py, and St. Hilaire, St. Souplet. It launched an attack on\r\nDecember 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division was retained on the Champagne front northwest of Souain\r\nuntil June, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved in the middle of June, it was sent to rest in the area\r\nsouthwest of Charleville (second half of June).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\nIt entrained for the Somme between July 2 and 4. Certain elements of the\r\n17th Division appeared in the sector of Biaches la Maisonnette, on July\r\n9 and 10. The entire division was in line between Barleux and Belloy\r\n(July 10 to 25) and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn from the front and reorganized (end of\r\nJuly to Aug. 15).\r\n\r\n4. From August 16 to August 20 to the middle of September it again\r\noccupied the sector of Barleux-Belloy.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of October the division was sent to Artois. It held\r\nthe line opposite Arras, between Roclincourt and Bailly, until December\r\n24.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. About January 9, 1917, the 17th Division occupied the sector of Py,\r\nsouth of the Ancre. Local combats in the neighborhood of Grandcourt and\r\nMiraumont (in January and February) caused it serious losses.\r\n\r\n2. The division was withdrawn from the Somme front about March 20, at\r\nthe time of the German retirement. It rested southwest of Douai (end of\r\nMarch and beginning of April).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. On April 10 it was sent as a reenforcement to Arras to oppose the\r\nBritish offensive. It held the sector of Oppy-Gavrelle and suffered a\r\ngreat deal in the course of counterattacks. It was relieved on April 25.\r\nFrom March 27 to April 24 the 7th Company of 90th Fusiliers lost 115\r\nmen. (British Summary of Information.)\r\n\r\n4. After a rest in the Tournai area until May 9 the 17th Division went\r\ninto line in the sector of Boursies, Demicourt (west of Cambrai).\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from this calm sector on May 28, it was sent to rest in the\r\nCambrai area until June 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. On this date it was transferred to Roulers by way of Valenciennes-\r\nMons and put on the Ypres front north of Hooge. It was withdrawn three\r\ndays before the British attack, on July 27, but suffered heavy losses\r\nfrom the bombardment.\r\n\r\n7. For five weeks, until September 23, the division occupied the calm\r\nsector of Havrincourt (south of the road Bapaume-Cambrai).\r\n\r\n8. On September 23 it again entrained for Flanders. Sent by way of\r\nCambrai to Ledeghem, it went into action in the Polygon wood sector\r\n(northeast of Ypres). On September 26 it counterattacked without success\r\nand with great losses. It only remained in line for two days. In these\r\nengagements the 75th Infantry Regiment lost 30 officers and 1,000 men\r\n(British Summary of Information.)\r\n\r\n9. Relieved on September 28 from the Flanders front, the 17th Division\r\nwas sent south of Lens on October 17. It was still there on February,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 17th Division is recruited from the Hanseatic towns and the Duchies\r\nof Mecklenburg. The sectional character was accentuated in June 1917,\r\nwhen the 89th Grenadiers took from the regiments of the 18th Division\r\nall the inhabitants of Mecklenburg who were in them. (Summary of\r\nInformation, June 28.)\r\n\r\nHowever, one must take into account a certain proportion of Poles from\r\nthe 6th Corps District, received in the replacements of 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1916, the following appreciation was written of the 9th Army\r\nCorps:\r\n\r\n“The 9th Army Corps gives the impression of a very good corps which\r\nwould be a formidable adversary. The intellectual level of officers and\r\nmen is appreciably higher than that ordinarily encountered in the German\r\nArmy. This fact is due to the recruiting which, in most cases, is done\r\nin Hamburg, Bremen, and Luebeck.”\r\n\r\nAfter the last combats of Flanders (July and September, 1917), the 17th\r\nDivision was considered as having its combative force perceptibly\r\ndiminished on account of its losses.\r\n\r\nIn a general manner, the division has given a good account of itself in\r\nthe course of its battles.\r\n\r\nThe Danes, who are numerous in its ranks, fight well and do not appear\r\nto occasion any weakness. (October, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on the Acheville sector on February 17–18\r\nby the 12th Reserve Division and went to rest near Douai until mid-\r\nMarch. On March 21 it was engaged near Lagnicourt and Moreuil (southeast\r\nof Arras), north of Vaulx-Vraucourt (22d), at Beliagnies and Lapigines\r\n(24th). The division was relieved on the 25th, after losing 50 per cent\r\nof its effectives. It rested until April 1, when it was reengaged near\r\nBucquoy until the 10th.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved by the 5th Bavarian Division, retired to\r\nthe Favreuil-Sapignies-Beugnatre area on the 10th, and the next day went\r\ninto billets near Cambrai. Later it moved to the Valenciennes area. On\r\nMay 24 it left Bouchain and traveled via Marquion to Bapaume, where it\r\ncame into line on that evening. While resting the division had undergone\r\nno special training. It is known to have received 1,300 men as a draft\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\n3. It was reengaged in the Bucquoy sector from May 24 to June 23, when\r\nit returned to rest near Bouchain until July 17. The division was moved\r\nto Laon on July 24–25 and from there marched to the Vesle front by\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE.\r\n\r\n4. About August 1 the division went into line between Bazoches and Mont\r\nNotre Dame. It fell back on the Aisne toward Bourg et Comin from\r\nSeptember 3–4, where it was relieved on September 15–16. The German\r\ncommunique of August 28 mentioned the 89th Grenadier Regiment for its\r\nconduct against the Americans at Bazoches.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE-AILETTE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was again in line on September 18 at Jouy-Aizy sector\r\n(north of Vailly). It retired to the Ailette on the 30th and shifted by\r\nrail to Semide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. On October 4 it was engaged southeast of Machault (Somme Py road).\r\nThe French attack forced it back to east of Attigny, where it was\r\nrelieved on the 19th.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested five days near Mouzon. It entrained on October 26\r\nand moved to Rozoy, reaching there on the 27–28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nARDENNES.\r\n\r\n8. It was put into line northwest of Chateau Porcien on the St. Fergeux-\r\nRecouvrance Road on October 28–29th. For its fighting east of Banonge on\r\nthe 29th, the 90th Regiment was complimented by the German communique of\r\nthe 30th. (558 prisoners were lost by the division on the 29th.) In\r\nNovember the division was driven back through Seraincourt, Remaucourt,\r\nChaumont Porcien, Rocquigny, St. Jean aux Bois.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. It was one of the best German\r\ndivisions. Its conduct in the March offensive won the Kaiser’s praise.\r\nUntil August it was relatively fresh, but after that was engaged almost\r\nconstantly in efforts to check the Allied offensive in Champagne. At the\r\nend the division was so reduced in numbers that it could muster but one\r\nor two battalions.\r\n\r\nIts morale was excellent until late in the fall, when it was lowered\r\nnoticeably. A mutiny and other acts of indiscipline were reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         17th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │81.      │162.     │81.      │162.     │81.      │162.\r\n              │         │163.     │         │163.     │         │163.\r\n              │33 Res.  │75 Res.  │33 Res.  │75 Res.  │33 Res.  │75 Res.\r\n              │         │76 Res.  │         │76 Res.  │         │76 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │6 Res.

The 17th Reserve Division formed with the 18th Reserve Division, the\r\n9th Reserve Corps. One of its brigades is a surplus brigade of the 9th\r\nArmy Corps (the 81st).\r\n\r\n2. During the first part of the month of August, 1914, the 17th Reserve\r\nDivision was used to guard the coast of Schleswig-Holstein.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. Entraining on August 23 for Belgium, it was at Louvain on the 25th,\r\nat Brussels on the 30th (until Sept. 3). It reached Termonde on\r\nSeptember 4, and remained outside of Antwerp.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n4. On September 9, it was transferred in haste to the Valenciennes area\r\nand then sent to the Oise. It detrained on the 13th at Chauny and went\r\ninto action on the right bank of the Oise, south of Noyon (Sept. 15 to\r\n20).\r\n\r\n5. About October 7 the 17th Reserve Division was sent to the vicinity of\r\nRoye, where it lost heavily.\r\n\r\n6. About the middle of November the division occupied the front between\r\nthe Avre and Roye. On December 20 it was in line between Ribecourt and\r\nThiescourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1915, the 75th Reserve Infantry Regiment entrained at\r\nNoyon for Upper Alsace (Hartmannswillerkopf), and did not return to the\r\ndivision until May.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYE (SOMME).\r\n\r\n1. On February 6 the division left the banks of the Oise to go back to\r\nthe area south of the Avre, between Lassigny and Roye. It remained in\r\nthis sector until the month of October.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of September elements of the division formed a part of\r\nthe Hartz Division in Artois (Sick and Balthasar Regiments).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. In October the 17th Reserve Division was withdrawn from the front\r\nsouth of Roye and sent to Artois, near Lens (Liévin-Givenchy).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 17th Reserve Division remained in Artois until the battle of the\r\nSomme. In February it launched several attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. About the beginning of July the 163d Infantry Regiment was sent,\r\ntemporarily, to reinforce the 185th Division, engaged along the Somme\r\nnear Cantalmaison.\r\n\r\n3. The 17th Reserve Division was in line as a whole north of the Somme\r\nabout July 25 (Bazentin-Pozières). It remained there until August 9–14.\r\n\r\n4. It was sent to rest and to be reorganized near Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of August it occupied the sector of Loos-Hulluch (north of\r\nLens). In September the 75th Reserve Infantry Regiment was sent to the\r\n211th Division.\r\n\r\n6. About September 21 the division returned to the Somme (Le Transloy-\r\nCombles), where it lost heavily (losses, 51 per cent).\r\n\r\n7. Relieved about October 10 it was transferred to Belgium.\r\n\r\n8. From October 23–25 to the end of January, 1917, it was in line\r\nbetween Het Sas and the Ypres-Roulers railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1917, the 17th Reserve Division was sent for a\r\nmonth’s rest near Bruges, and again took over its sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. It left the Ypres salient at the end of March and went into line\r\nsoutheast of Arras. On April 9 it suffered very heavy losses from the\r\nBritish offensives (2,100 prisoners).\r\n\r\n3. On April 12–13 the division was relieved and sent to rest and to be\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n4. On April 27 it took over the sector of Havrincourt (southwest of\r\nCambrai) and occupied it until June 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to the Arras front, the 17th Reserve Division went back\r\ninto line in the sector Guémappe-Monchy le Preux, where it launched\r\nseveral violent battles during the month of June. At the end of July it\r\nextended its sector toward the north (south of the Scarpe).\r\n\r\n6. Relieved at the end of August it went back into line at the beginning\r\nof September southeast of Arras (Vis en Artois). It lost especially\r\nheavy during the gas attacks. (It received, on Oct. 23, 40 men per\r\ncompany, coming from Hamburg and Beverloo, slightly trained, and on Nov.\r\n10 men taken from the Russian front.) (Summary of Information, Dec. 2.)\r\n\r\n7. The 17th Reserve Division left Artois in the middle of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n8. Sent to Flanders the division took over the sector at Becelaere about\r\nNovember 18. The division was engaged against the British attack of\r\nDecember 3 and suffered heavy losses. It underwent violent attacks and\r\nleft the front in the beginning of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is recruited in Schleswig-Holstein, the Hanseatic cities,\r\nand adjacent parts of Hanover. Some replacement troops were from\r\nWestphalia, and in September, 1916, men from Brandenburg of the 1917\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1917 the 17th Reserve Division launched a great number\r\nof terrible attacks on the Arras front and in Flanders.\r\n\r\nAt Becelaere (Dec., 1917) it gave proof of great stubbornness. The 162d\r\nInfantry Regiment carried out a successful attack in this sector on\r\nDecember 14. However, a few months before, on June 18, the 163d Infantry\r\nRegiment is said to have refused to advance. (Summary of Information,\r\nJune 19.)\r\n\r\nAlthough this division is not one of the best in the German Army and its\r\nmorale is mediocre it is capable of offering serious resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The northern sector was a fairly quiet front in the winter months and\r\nthe division remained in line here until just before the German\r\noffensive on the Lys of April 9. Prior to this attack all of the\r\ndivision but one battalion of the 76th Reserve Regiment was withdrawn\r\nand sent hurriedly to the vicinity of Messines. It attacked there with\r\nother German divisions on the morning of April 9 under orders to take\r\nMessines by the evening of the 10th and to push ahead as far as\r\npossible. It gained considerable ground at heavy cost. Elements of the\r\n7th Division relieved part of the 17th Reserve Division a few days\r\nlater, but the bulk of the division remained in line until about April\r\n22, when it was relieved by the 13th Reserve Division and the 19th\r\nReserve Division.\r\n\r\n2. On April 24 the division arrived in the Maldeghem area for a long\r\nrest. While there the divisional and the brigade commanders were\r\ndecorated for their part in the Lys offensive. Death notices published\r\nin the German newspapers disclosed the death of two battalion and many\r\ncompany commanders on the Lys. While at rest the division went through\r\ncourses of training. On June 4 it entrained at Eecloo and moved via Mons\r\nand Marle to Tergnier. At this time the Noyon offensive (June 9) was\r\nbeing organized. The division marched at night to Boulogne la Grasse\r\n(10th) and went into line on the evening of the 11th near Mery,\r\nrelieving the 227th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was in heavy fighting immediately and suffered severely\r\nin the successful French counteroffensive of June 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MATZ.\r\n\r\n4. The French attack in August threw the division back on Canny sur Matz\r\nand later north of Fresnieres. It passed to second line about August 31,\r\nbut was reengaged on September 5 at Esmery-Hallon. It suffered heavy\r\nlosses and was taken out on September 9.\r\n\r\n5. The division was moved to Lorraine, where it rested a month and\r\nreturned to Le Cateau on October 10.\r\n\r\n6. The division was engaged at Le Cateau on October 11 and resisted the\r\nBritish attack until November 3. It fought near Le Cateau (Oct. 18),\r\nBazuel (21st), Forest (23d), Landrecies (24th), and Bois L’Eveque (Oct.\r\n27). The division received the men of the 265th Reserve Regiment (108th\r\nDivision) as a draft in October.\r\n\r\n7. The division was out of line from November 3 to the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. Its effectives were generally\r\nyoung; 31 per cent belong to the 1919 class and 18 per cent to the 1918\r\nclass on October 1. It took a prominent part in the Lys and Noyon\r\noffensives, winning a reputation for its vigorous attacks. Its defensive\r\nwork in October around Le Cateau was of a high order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        17th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │182 Ldw.      │380           │182 Ldw.      │380.\r\n              │              │  (Kurhatowski│              │\r\n              │              │  Rgt.).      │              │\r\n              │              │381 (Nussbaum │              │381.\r\n              │              │  Rgt.).      │              │\r\n              │              │23 Landst.    │              │23 Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │1 Landst.

At the outbreak of the war the 18th Division (of the 9th Army Corps,\r\nwith the 17th Division) formed a part of the 1st Army (Von Kluck).\r\nEntraining at Aix la Chapelle August 8–10, it was before Liege on the\r\n13th, went into action at Tirlemont on the 18th, at Mons on the 23d,\r\nentered France on the 25th, crossed the Marne at Chateau Thierry on\r\nSeptember 3, and took part in the battle of the Marne on September 6 and\r\n7, at Esternay and Courgivaux.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. After the retreat it took up its position north of the Aisne, where\r\nit remained for more than a year in various parts of the sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1915, the 84th Infantry Regiment was taken from the 18th\r\nDivision to help in the formation of the 54th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. Until October, 1915, the 18th Division occupied the sectors of the\r\nAisne. On June 3 the 86th Fusiliers attacked at Quennevieres, suffering\r\nenormous losses. (Between June 18 and July 3 its 5th Company received at\r\nleast 115 men as replacements; the 8th Company, 120.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. From October, 1915, until June, 1916, the 18th Division was in\r\nChampagne (Souain area).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. On February 25, 1916, the 31st Infantry Regiment suffered heavy\r\nlosses south of St. Marie a Py; its 11th Company was entirely destroyed\r\nor captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. From July to September, 1916, the 18th Division was in action along\r\nthe Somme (south of the Somme). At Belloy, on September 4, the 4th\r\nCompany of the 86th Fusiliers was destroyed with the exception of 23\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. From October until the beginning of December the division was in the\r\nArras area (east).\r\n\r\n4. It left Artois about December 12 to take over a sector along the\r\nSomme (Grandcourt).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. About February 18, 1917, the 18th Division was withdrawn from the\r\nfront, then sent back into line at the beginning of March, at Puisieux-\r\nGommecourt (Somme).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of March it was transferred to Artois, north of the\r\nScarpe, and went into action at Roeux and Fampoux, from April 10 to\r\nApril 23.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the end of April, it went back into line about May 8, in\r\nthe area south of Arras, and from that date until the end of August\r\noccupied sectors in the vicinity of Cambrai (Villers-Plouich,\r\nHavrincourt, Marcoing).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. On August 27 the 18th Division was relieved from the Cambrai front\r\n(Ribecourt-Marcoing sector) and entrained for Flanders, where it was\r\nmade an army reserve in the Ruddervoorde (northeast of Thourout). It was\r\nthere reorganized with replacements coming from troops of the 9th Corps\r\nDistrict stationed in Russia (taken from the 426th Infantry Regiment,\r\nthe 31st Landwehr Regiment, and the 3d Ersatz Reserve Regiment).\r\n\r\n5. It went into the sector Mangelaere about September 16 and underwent\r\nthe Franco-British attack of October 9, which caused it rather serious\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n6. The 18th Division was relieved about October 14 and transferred to\r\nRussia, where it made a rather short stay in the Vilna area.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n7. It was back in Upper Alsace about the end of November, in the region\r\nof Mulhouse, at the beginning of February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Division is recruited from Schleswig-Holstein (Prussians and\r\nDanes). A certain proportion of Poles from Silesia appeared in the\r\nreplacements of 1917 (especially in the 31st Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Division has always passed as being a good division. However,\r\nin the course of the Franco-British attack of October 9, 1917, none of\r\nits elements carried out the counterattacks described by their leaders;\r\nhowever, in order to form a correct judgment of this, one must take\r\naccount of the intensity of the bombardment, the state of the terrain,\r\nand the weakness of the effectives in line at that moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Division left Alsace, entraining at Mulhouse, about the 12th\r\nof February, and traveled via Thionville and Sedan to Bertry, where it\r\ndetrained after a journey of 2½ days. It relieved the 107th Division\r\nnear Gonnelieu (south of Cambrai) the 16th. It was withdrawn the\r\nbeginning of March, and had a few days’ training near Ligny en\r\nCambresis.\r\n\r\n2. It left here on the 17th and marched to Malincourt, where it stayed\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n3. It reenforced the battle front near Hargicourt (north of St. Quentin)\r\non March 21. The next day the division commander was killed. The\r\ndivision was withdrawn about the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of March 29–30 the division relieved the 1st\r\nDivision near Sailly le Sec (south of Albert). Here again heavy losses\r\nwere suffered. The division received a draft of 500 men, mostly returned\r\nwounded. It is not clear just what happened during this period and as\r\nlate as about the 18th of May, when the division was withdrawn, but it\r\nseems as though its regiments and the regiments of the 50th Reserve\r\nDivision and the 199th Division inter-relieved each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAI.\r\n\r\n5. The division went to the Tournai region, where it rested, was\r\ncompletely reconstituted, and trained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n6. On August 1 it reenforced the battle front near Launoy (southwest of\r\nSoissons), after having left Tournai July 21 and having detrained at La\r\nFere the following day. Toward the end of its tour in line (it was\r\nwithdrawn during the night of Oct. 12–13), it retreated along the line\r\nFroidmont-Eppes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n7. The division was transported by truck and relieved the 22d Reserve\r\nDivision near Bernoville (northeast of St. Quentin) on October 15. On\r\nthe 17th it withdrew to Grougis, and then to the Sambre Canal. During\r\nthese operations it lost more than 500 prisoners. It was withdrawn about\r\nthe 28th.\r\n\r\n8. On November 4 the division reenforced the front near Hannapes (north\r\nof Guise) and withdrew, with the remainder of the line, through Iron,\r\nthe Nouvion region, Boulogne sur Helpe, and Etroeung. It was still in\r\nline on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Division is rated as being first class. Since the spring,\r\nhowever, it has not been used to any great extent where heavy fighting\r\nwas in progress, and it may well be it has deteriorated. It is known\r\nthat part of the 6th Company of the 86th Regiment refused to go into\r\nline on October 25 until it was threatened with being shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         18th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │53 Res.  │84 Res.  │35 Res.  │84 Res.  │35 Res.  │31 Res.\r\n              │         │86 Res.  │         │86 Res.  │         │84 Res.\r\n              │36 Res.  │31 Res.  │36 Res.  │31 Res.  │         │86 Res.\r\n              │         │90 Res.  │         │90 Res.  │         │\r\n              │ 9 Res.

The 18th Reserve Division formed the 9th Reserve Corps, with the 17th\r\nReserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n2. From the outbreak of the war until August 22, 1914, the 18th Reserve\r\nDivision was guarding the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Entraining about\r\nthis time, it went into Belgium, where it advanced rapidly. After taking\r\nand sacking Louvain (Aug. 25) it occupied Hamme (Sept. 1), Termonde\r\n(Sept. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 9th it was hastily transferred by way of Tournai and\r\nValenciennes to the Oise area. Entraining on the 13th at Chauny, it\r\nreenforced the front south of Noyon and went into action between\r\nCarlepont and Lassigny (Sept. 15–21).\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October the 18th Reserve Division was taken to\r\nthe valley of the Avre. It fought in the vicinity of Roye (Laucourt,\r\nOct. 2–3). At the beginning of November the division front extended\r\nbetween the Avre and Beuvraignes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n5. On November 15 it bore to the south and held the region of the Loges-\r\nLassigny wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1915, it gave the 90th Reserve Infantry Regiment to the 54th\r\nDivision, a new formation.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Reserve Division occupied the Lassigny area until October,\r\n1915, without any serious engagements. In October it took over elements\r\nof the Hartz Division (6th Army), among others the 3d Battalion of the\r\n31st Infantry Regiment which contained four battalions from May, 1915,\r\nto September, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. About October 23 the division was sent to Artois (Givenchy), where it\r\nlaunched several local attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Reserve Division remained in the Liévin-Givenchy sector\r\nuntil July, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. After a few days at rest, July 13 to July 28, it took part in the\r\nbattle of the Somme, north of Pozieres, in several serious attacks.\r\n\r\n3. It was reorganized in the Valenciennes area during the second half of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of August, it was sent northeast of Lens (Pont a Vendin).\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of October the 18th Reserve Division again went into\r\naction along the Somme, north of Combles, (Morval, Sailly Saillisel). It\r\nsuffered heavily in a series of local attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. Withdrawn from the front about October 12–16, the division was\r\ntransferred to Belgium. On October 23–25 it went into line north of\r\nYpres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Reserve Division occupied the Ypres salient (Pilkem) until\r\nthe end of March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. After a short rest at Roulers, the division was concentrated at Vitry\r\nen Artois (Apr. 1). Going into action southeast of Arras (Heninel), it\r\nunderwent the British attack (Apr. 9), which caused it heavy losses (500\r\nprisoners).\r\n\r\n3. The division left the Artois front about April 15, and after a few\r\ndays at rest took over the sector of Cherisy-Guemappe (southeast of\r\nArras in May).\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of June the 18th Reserve Division was relieved and\r\nsent to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to Flanders about June 16, it first remained in reserve\r\nbehind the Messines front. On July 3 the division was in action west of\r\nHouthem and suffered severe losses in consequence of local actions and\r\nbombardments.\r\n\r\n6. Relieved about August 8, it was at rest in the Cambrai area until\r\nAugust 16. It then occupied the quiet sector of Queant (west of Cambrai)\r\nuntil the middle of October.\r\n\r\n7. It was sent to Flanders again on October 20, and went into line near\r\nthe Ypres-Menin railroad (Oct. 28–29).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Reserve Division is recruited in Schleswig-Holstein.\r\n\r\nThe Mecklenburgers, according to an order in 1917, had to return to\r\ntheir national regiment, the 90th Infantry Reserve Regiment, which no\r\nlonger belonged to the division. A limited number of men from the 7th\r\nand 10th Corps districts (Westphalia and Hanover) is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE 1917—ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Reserve Division has the same value as the 17th Reserve\r\nDivision. At the end of 1917 it is difficult to form an opinion as to\r\nits combat value. It has not been in any serious action since the battle\r\nof Arras, having arrived in Flanders when the autumn operations were\r\nabout at an end. The morale of the division may be considered as\r\npassable. (British Summary of Information, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Reserve Division was relieved by the 214th Division in the\r\nGheluvelt sector on January 6. It went to rest in the vicinity of Menin\r\nand while there was intensively trained in open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. On February 18 the division relieved the 214th Division in its former\r\nsector north of Gheluvelt (east of Ypres). It was relieved by the 7th\r\nReserve Division about March 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE.\r\n\r\n3. It reinforced the battle front near Locon (northwest of La Bassee) on\r\nApril 9, and was withdrawn about the 18th, going to rest in the Sainghin\r\narea (southeast of Lille).\r\n\r\n4. On May 14 it relieved the 25th Division west of Locon, and was\r\nrelieved by the extension of fronts of the neighboring divisions about\r\nthe 18th of June, when it went to rest in the region of Gondecourt (east\r\nof La Bassee).\r\n\r\n5. About the 14th of July it relieved the 1st Guard Reserve Division\r\nnear Givenchy (north of the La Bassee Canal—west of La Bassee); relieved\r\nSeptember 3, it went to rest in the region north of Denain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. On the 29th of September the division reentered the line near\r\nProville and Rumilly (south of Cambrai), and was still in line when the\r\narmistice was signed. It was thought that it had been withdrawn October\r\n8, again on the 18th, and on the 4th of November, but considering the\r\nspeed with which the German withdrawal was executed, the confusion\r\nnecessarily incident thereto, and the fact that the division always\r\nturned up a day or two later in the same relative position it had\r\npreviously occupied, it seems best to assume that it was continuously in\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Reserve is considered a second-class division. It did not\r\ndistinguish itself in the Lys offensive, and it is reported that\r\nthereafter it was to be used only as a holding division. At any rate, it\r\nengaged in no other German offensives, and, indeed, no other heavy\r\nfighting, until the beginning of October or sometime after practically\r\nthe whole front had become active on account of the combined allied\r\npush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        18th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │           1914–15           │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │19 Ldw.       │19 Ldw.       │20 Ldw.       │19 Ldw.\r\n              │              │47 Ldw.       │              │47 Ldw.\r\n              │              │72 Ldw.       │28 Ldw.       │133 Ldw.\r\n              │              │133 Ldw.      │              │57 Ldw.\r\n              │              │              │              │72 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │Ers.

(57th Landwehr\r\n Regiment: 7th Corps district.—Westphalia.) (72d Landwehr Regiment: 4th\r\n                   Corps district.—Prussian Saxony.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                1914–15.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Landwehr Division is the former Bredow Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n2. After being engaged in September, 1914, in the battle of the Mazurian\r\nLakes, the Bredow Division fought in the Polish campaign: Battle of\r\nWarsaw (Oct. 9–19, 1914); battles on the Rawka (Oct. 22–28); near\r\nCzenstochow (Nov. 10-Dec. 15); between Pilica and Nidi, in the\r\nmountainous region of Kielce (December, 1914, to July, 1915).\r\n\r\n3. In the middle of July, 1915, the division was in action near Sienno\r\nand before Ivangorod (breaking of the Russian front), crossed the\r\nVistula (end of July), was in action between the Vistula and the Bug\r\n(Aug. 8–18), and advanced in action as far as Slonim and the Upper\r\nChtchara (September). The front becoming stabilized in this area, the\r\nBredow Division took up its position southeast of Novo-Grudok (near\r\nGoroditche in October and November). At the end of November it went into\r\nthe sector southeast of Liakhovitchi (south of Baranovitchi). The number\r\n18 appears to be given to the Bredow Division in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARANOVITCHI.\r\n\r\n1. The 18th Landwehr Division remained on the front south of\r\nBaranovitchi (Liakhovitchi) for more than two years (November, 1915, to\r\nthe beginning of 1918). From July 2 to July 9, 1916, it withstood the\r\nRussian attacks in this area.\r\n\r\n2. In June, 1916, two regiments of the division, the 57th Landwehr and\r\nthe 133d Landwehr, were transferred to Volhynia (north of Lutsk),\r\nassigned to the Rusche Division and were in action against the offensive\r\nof Broussilov. The 57th Landwehr Regiment rejoined the 18th Landwehr\r\nDivision near Baranovitchi in August. The 133d Landwehr Regiment was\r\nprovisionally a part of the 92d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector Baranovitchi-Liakhovitchi.\r\n\r\n2. In October 900 men from the 18th Landwehr Division, chosen from among\r\nthe youngest, were entrained for the western front. In April a number\r\nhad been taken from the 72d Landwehr Regiment for the 5th Reserve\r\nDivision. In November the 47th Landwehr Regiment furnished men to the\r\n15th Division. As the 18th Landwehr Division had received no\r\nreplacements since the end of July, the trench strength of the 72d\r\nLandwehr Regiment had fallen, at the end of October, to 50–60 men per\r\ncompany (Russian interrogation).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division has been on the Russian front since the beginning of the\r\nwar. Combat value appears to be mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1918, the 18th Landwehr Division advanced into the\r\ninterior of Russia. The 72d Landwehr Regiment was identified between\r\nMohilev and Gomel on February 2. In May the 57th Landwehr Regiment held\r\nthe very long front from north of Kopys to south of Chklov.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of June the division was in the Orcha region. It was\r\nagain identified in the region of Mohilev on the 22d of September.\r\n\r\n3. There were rumors during October that the division had come to the\r\nWoevre, but since the division was never actually identified it is not\r\nbelieved that it left Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             19th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │37.      │78.      │37.      │78.      │37.      │74.\r\n              │         │91.      │         │91.      │         │78.\r\n              │38.      │73 Fus.  │38.      │73 Fus.  │         │91.\r\n              │         │74.      │         │74.      │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │17 Hus.

The 19th Division constituted, at the outbreak of the war, with the\r\n20th Division, the 10th Army Corps (Hanover), which was a part of the 2d\r\nArmy (Von Buelow).\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM-MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. On August 3 one of its brigades, the 38th, was at Malmedy for the\r\nattack upon Liége, where it went into action on the 5th. After the fall\r\nof Liége the 19th Division, going around Namur on the north, fought at\r\nCharleroi on the 23d, entered France on the 25th, and went into action\r\nat Guise, at St. Quentin. It took part in the battle of the Marne on the\r\nright of the 20th Division, and then withdrew with that division to the\r\nnorthwest of Reims.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. In October it was in the same sector attached to the 7th Army (Von\r\nHeeringen) and remained during the winter of 1914–15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1915, the 73d Fusiliers left the division to become a part\r\nof the 111th Division (a new formation).\r\n\r\n2. In April the 19th Division was sent (with the 20th) to Galicia, where\r\nit took part in the offensive of Mackensen’s army. This campaign caused\r\nheavy losses; in the 91st Infantry Regiment, between May and September,\r\nthe casualties totaled 127 officers and 4,291 men. (Official List of\r\ncasualties.)\r\n\r\n3. Entraining at Warsaw on September 17 the 19th Division, together with\r\nthe 20th, was taken to Antwerp, then, by way of Namur and Givet, to\r\nChampagne. There it remained behind the front to reinforce the 3d Army\r\nat the time of our attack on the Champagne front (September).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. It was relieved about October 17. After a few days rest in the area\r\nof Grandlup, Missy les Pierrepont, it occupied the Hurtebise-Vauclerc\r\nline at the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. About December 19 it was withdrawn to the rear (Parfondru area). It\r\nremained in reserve of the army and received training.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division again went into line at the beginning of January, 1916\r\n(Hurtebise-Vauclerc sector) and remained there until the middle of May.\r\nThen it was sent to Sissonne and received training until June 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. About June 8 it left Sissonne and entrained for the Eastern Front.\r\nItinerary: Laon-Sedan-Trèves-Coblentz-Limberg-Marburg-Cassel-Leipzig-\r\nBreslau-Bautzen-Iwagorod-Kovel (June 12).\r\n\r\n3. The division was retrained on the Russian front from June until\r\nNovember. It underwent the Broussilov offensive, and in November formed\r\na part of the 4th Austrian Army in action on the Volhynia front.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. About November 8 it entrained and left Russia to return to the\r\nWestern Front. Itinerary: Kovel-Brest-Litowsk-Warsaw-Thorn-Berlin-\r\nHanover-Aix la Chapelle-Liége-Namur-Givet-Hirson.\r\n\r\n5. After a few days of rest, the 19th Division entrained for Rethel. It\r\nwas billeted in the vicinity until the end of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. After a stay in Alsace (January, 1917) the 19th Division came into\r\nreserve in Champagne in February.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. On February 24 it occupied the sector Ripont, Cernay en Dormois.\r\n\r\n3. On March 6 it was transferred to the Rheims front (Brimont, Cavaliers\r\nde Coucy in April and May). Only its right wing was engaged in the\r\nFrench offensive.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved on the 10th of June and sent to rest, it was in action\r\nshortly afterwards southwest of Moronvilliers, then on the Cornillet-\r\nMonc St. Blond front, where it underwent the French attacks of July 14\r\nand suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. On July 20, it left this area and in two days marched to the sector\r\nnorth of Ville sur Tourbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. About September 7 it was sent to the Verdun area (Beaumont-\r\nSamogneux). It there launched several attacks.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved from the Beaumont sector at the end of December, the 19th\r\nDivision occupied the Forges sector (left bank of the Meuse) about\r\nJanuary 6, 1918. There it was relieved by the 84th Division beginning of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Division is recruited from Hanover. The 91st Infantry Regiment\r\nis recruited in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. There were very few\r\nreplacements from other corps districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Division must be considered a good division (September, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested at Stenay until March 6, when it entrained and\r\ntraveled via Sedan-Charleville-Anor to Landrecies, going into billets at\r\nHecq. On the 17th it marched to Croix and in the evening proceeded via\r\nLe Cateau to Honnechy. On the night of March 19–20 it marched to\r\nBrancourt, and on the 21st followed up the attack as far as Maissemy.\r\nThe 91st Regiment crossed the Somme at Brie on the 25th and by the 28th\r\nhad reached Harbonnieres.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was in support until the 31st, when it was engaged near\r\nMarcelcaves. In the fighting in this locality between the 30th and April\r\n6, the division lost 50 per cent of its effectives. The heaviest losses\r\nwere incurred on March 31 at Brie where a battalion commander, ordered\r\nto attack, was unable to do so because of his losses.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested until April 16 in the neighborhood of Proyart and\r\nFramerville. About 1,000 men were received as reinforcements at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. It was engaged on April 18, north of Hangard, until the 20th. Two\r\ndays of rest at Harbonnieres followed, and it returned to line on the\r\n24th. The French attack of the 26th caused the division severe losses\r\nand it withdrew on April 28. It was reengaged on the same sector on May\r\n6 and in line until May 29. While in line the division received drafts\r\nof 1,200 men.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested until the 1st of June in the vicinity of Cambrai.\r\nIt marched toward the Lassigny front by night, passing through Ham (June\r\n2), Esmery-Hallon, Tilloloy (June 7–8).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n6. It was engaged on June 9 in the Lataule wood and was in line until\r\nthe 14th. It entrained on the 21st and moved to Lorraine, where it\r\nrelieved the 3d Guard Division at Bezanges on June 25. It rested on this\r\nquiet front until July 29, when the 81st Reserve Division from Flanders\r\nrelieved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested near Fort Brimont until mid-August, when it moved\r\nby stages to the Vesle front. It entered the line northeast of Fismes on\r\nSeptember 1 and remained during the month. The division withstood the\r\nFrench attack of the 31st, losing about 700 prisoners. It was forced to\r\nretire on Ventelay and Chaudardes (Oct. 1), and later on Pontavert,\r\nCraonne, toward Sissonne (Oct. 11–12). It was in second line about the\r\n13th to 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n8. On October 19 it was again in line near Sissonne. In the retreat it\r\nretired by Boucourt, la Ville aux Bois, Montcornet. After November 4 it\r\nwas identified near Renneval, Iviers, and Aubenton (Nov. 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. It was regarded as one of the\r\nbest German divisions. It resisted with great obstinacy the French\r\ncounterattack at Hangard, April 26. Its morale remained good until the\r\nend of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         19th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │37 Res.  │73 Res.  │37 Res.  │73 Res.  │37 Res.  │73 Res.\r\n              │         │78 Res.  │         │78 Res.  │         │78 Res.\r\n              │39 Res.  │74 Res.  │39 Res.  │74 Res.  │         │79 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  (2\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Btns.)\r\n              │         │92 Res.  │         │92 Res.  │39 Res.  │74 Res.\r\n              │         │79 Res.  │         │79 Res.  │         │92 Res.\r\n              │         │  (2     │         │  (2     │         │\r\n              │         │  Btns.) │         │  Btns.) │         │\r\n              │ 10 Res.

The 19th Reserve Division, constituting at the outbreak of the war,\r\nwith the 2d Reserve Guard Division, the 10th Reserve Corps, was a part\r\nof the 2d Army (Von Buelow). It entrained near Cologne August 10–12, was\r\nconcentrated at the Elsenhorn Camp and entered Belgium on the 15th by\r\nway of Spa. Going down the left bank of the Meuse near Liége, it crossed\r\nthe Sambre west of Charleroi on the 22d; went into action on the 23d at\r\nNalinnes; entered France on the 26th at Avesnes, and fought on the 29th\r\nand 30th between St. Quentin and Ribemont. Continuing on its way through\r\nBraine, it crossed the Marne at Dormans and took part in the battle of\r\nthe Marne between Vauchamps and Montmirail (Sept. 6 to 7).\r\n\r\n2. It retired on the 7th by way of Orbais, Vertus, Epernay, Rilly la\r\nMontagne (Sept. 10), Rheims (Sept. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. It fought, in the middle of September, north of Rheims and\r\nestablished itself on the front Brimont-Courcy-Bétheny (October-\r\nDecember).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The division occupied the sector north of Rheims until the beginning\r\nof February, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERTHES.\r\n\r\n2. About February 2, elements of the division were transferred to the\r\nSomme Py and went into action in the Perthes les Hurlus area, where they\r\ntook part in serious battles.\r\n\r\n3. The division remained in Champagne (Souain-Perthes) until the month\r\nof April.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n4. About the end of April it was sent to Alsace (valley of the Fecht).\r\nAt this time, the 10th Reserve Corps was broken up because of the\r\nemployment of its two divisions on two separate fronts (19th Reserve\r\nDivision, Vosges, 2d Reserve Guard Division, in the north). These two\r\ndivisions are now independent. The 19th Reserve Division suffered very\r\nheavily in Alsace (valley of the Fecht) and lost 154 officers and 5,033\r\nmen (Official List of Casualties), of whom 60 officers and 1,964 men\r\nbelong to the 74th Reserve Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 30 the 37th Reserve Brigade entrained to reenforce the\r\nunits engaged in the Tahure sector (Champagne), where it went into\r\naction on October 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n6. The 37th Reserve Brigade rejoined the 39th Reserve Brigade in Alsace\r\nat the beginning of November. At this time the entire division was\r\nconcentrated in the vicinity of Mulhouse.\r\n\r\n7. In December elements of the 19th Reserve Division took part in the\r\nstruggle for the possession of Hartmannswillerkopf (Dec. 21–29).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 19th Reserve Division remained in the Meuse area until March,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. About March 15 the division entrained and was transferred to Verdun.\r\nIt went into action in the sector Douaumont-Haudremont-Thiaumont (Apr.\r\n17 to June 21). Its regiments made successive attacks and suffered\r\nheavily (attacks of Apr. 17, 24, May 7, and June 21). At the end of\r\nApril and during the month of May, elements of the division were sent to\r\nrest in the vicinity of Montmédy.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of July the 19th Reserve Division was withdrawn from\r\nthe Verdun front and went into the Argonne (La Harazee). It had lost 79\r\nper cent of its infantry at Verdun. From April 25 to July 19 the 4th\r\nCompany of the 74th Infantry Regiment had received no less than 195 men\r\nas replacements; the 9th Company of the 73d Infantry Regiment, 211 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On October 10 it was transferred to the Somme (sector of Gueudecourt\r\nles Boeufs) and took part in limited actions which caused serious\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved on October 26–28, it went into line on the Côtes de Meuse\r\n(Les Éparges) on October 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n1. On February 18, 1917, the 19th Reserve Division left the Éparges\r\nsector for the front south of Laon. Concentrated in the region of\r\nArrancy-Ste. Croix, it went into line about March 1, on the crest of the\r\nChemin des Dames (Ailles-Hurtebise). It underwent the French attack of\r\nApril 16, which caused it to suffer severely (900 prisoners).\r\n\r\nOn April 20 elements of the Division launched a counterattack (Poteau\r\nd’Ailles). The 19th Reserves Division remained in line until April 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. After two weeks’ rest in the vicinity of Sissonne, the division was\r\ntransferred to Russia. It entrained at La Capelle on May 7. Itinerary:\r\nCharleroi-Namur-Liége-Aix le Chapelle-Dusseldorf-Hanover-Berlin-\r\nBromberg-Koenigsberg-Shavli-Mitau; detraining at Gross-Ekkau on May 11,\r\nit was called on July 23 to help the exhausted 226th Division between\r\nSmorgoni and Krevo.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGA.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of August or the beginning of September the division took\r\npart in the operations which began at the taking of Riga and of\r\nDuenamuende (September).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. On September 11 the division entrained near Uxkull for the Western\r\nFront. Itinerary: Mitau-Shavli-Koenigsberg-Posen-Cottbus-Leipzig-Gotha-\r\nMayence-Kreuznach-Luxemburg-Sedan-Hirson. It detrained at Vervins on\r\nSeptember 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to Flanders (Sept. 20–24) it occupied the Polygon wood\r\nsector east of Ypres (Sept. 28). It underwent the British attack of\r\nOctober 4, when it lost very heavily. It was relieved immediately. (On\r\nSept. 29 the 12th Company of the 92d Reserve Infantry Regiment had only\r\n3 officers and 86 men.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. After a rest near Sedan, in the course of which it was reorganized\r\nwith mixed replacements from Beverloo and the recruit depot of the 228th\r\nDivision, the division went northwest of Verdun in October (Malancourt\r\nsector).\r\n\r\n7. Sent to rest in the Stenay area on December 22, the 19th Reserve\r\nDivision occupied the Chaume wood sector on January 15, 1918. It was\r\nstill there at the beginning of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Reserve Division is recruited from the 10th Corps District\r\n(Hanover, Oldenburg, Brunswick). There are few elements foreign to the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the French offensive on the Chemin des Dames on April 16 the 19th\r\nReserve Division gave the impression of having energetic and intelligent\r\nleadership. The attitude of the men was generally good.\r\n\r\nThe division suffered enormous losses on the Aisne.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the replacements received and its stay on the Russian\r\nfront have diminished the value of this division, which was a good\r\ncombat unit.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a certain number of Poles and Alsatians must be noted\r\nwho are inclined to desertion (67 deserters from the 73d Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment on Sept. 28, 1917). (November, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

The 19th Ersatz Division (Saxon) detrained on August 18, 1914, before\r\nStrassburg. In action in the Vosges on the 20th, it went up the valley\r\nof the Bruche and fought on the Meurthe below St. Die, at St. Michel,\r\nand advanced to La Salle (Sept. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. Having suffered in these engagements, the division was withdrawn. On\r\nSeptember 19 it was in the Blamont area, where it was reenforced by the\r\n5th Bavarian Landwehr Brigade. It occupied the sector of Blamont-Ember-\r\nMenil-Parroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In 1915, and until October, 1916, it guarded the same front in\r\nLorraine (from the canal of the Marne to the Rhine as far as the Cirey\r\narea).\r\n\r\n2. About the month of April the 100th Landwehr was reattached to the\r\ndivision, the battalions of which were grouped in July into 4 Ersatz\r\nRegiments (Nos. 23, 32, 24, 40).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1.

The 23d Ersatz alone took part in the affair of\r\nThiaville, February 28, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved in the area of Badonviller-Leintrey, at the beginning of\r\nOctober, 1916, the 19th Ersatz Division was reduced to three regiments\r\n(23d, 32d, 24th Ersatz) and sent to the Briey area (Oct. 8) and from\r\nthere to Verdun (sector of Watronville-Damloup).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. The 19th Ersatz Division remained in the same sector of the Cotes de\r\nMeuse for almost all of the year 1917. It lost very slightly.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the sector Moranville-Watronville about November, the\r\ndivision was sent to rest in the Longwy area.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEZONVAUX.\r\n\r\n3. About December 8, it was assembled and sent to Spincourt where, on\r\nDecember 11, it went into line north of Bezonvaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Ersatz Division is recruited from the Kingdom of Saxony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Ersatz Division remained in Lorraine for a long time; it did\r\nnot take part in any serious battles. After October, 1916, it only\r\noccupied quiet sectors on the Cotes de Meuse.\r\n\r\nIt can not be considered as an attack division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division occupied the quiet Beaumont sector until June 30, when\r\nit was put at rest near Longuyon until July 11. During this time the\r\ndivision was given training to fit it for a war of movement. On July 16\r\nit was moved to the Rheims front. Entrained at Montmedy on the 12th, the\r\ndivision reached Nouvion Porcien the next day, and went by stages to\r\nBermericourt (northeast of Rheims), where it rested in reserve. On the\r\n17th it moved to the vicinity of Rozoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE AND MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. From July 20 to 31 the division was engaged in severe fighting at\r\nPlessier-Huleu and Grand Rozoy.\r\n\r\n3. It rested near Marle until the 21st of August undergoing\r\nreconstruction. It entrained on that date at Voyenne and reached La Fere\r\nthe next day, from where it marched to Barisis and Folembray.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AILETTE.\r\n\r\n4. The division entered the line in the Quierzy-Manicamp-Champs area on\r\nAugust 23. It sustained a French attack on the 28th, losing nearly 500\r\nprisoners. The division was withdrawn on September 3.\r\n\r\n5. The division was moved by train from Voyenne to Haboudange via Marle,\r\nMontcornet, Sedan, Montmedy, Longuyon, Audun le Roman, Thionville, Metz,\r\nand Benestroff.

It was formed at\r\nCortemarck on September 29, 1916, by the union of the 383d, 385th, and\r\n388th Landwehr Regiments. These were made up of Landsturm battalions\r\n(Service of Supplies) of the 4th Army in Belgium, to which were added\r\nreturned wounded.

At the outbreak of the war the 20th Division went to the Elsenborn\r\nCamp, August 8–10, and entered Belgium on the 11th. It was a part, with\r\nthe 10th Corps, of the 2d Army (Von Buelow). It fought at Charleroi, at\r\nGuise, at St. Quentin. It took part in the battle of the Marne from\r\nSeptember 6 to 9 (Congy, Mondement), after which it retired by way of\r\nNeufchâtel sur Aisne to the northwest of Rheims. It took up its position\r\nbetween the Aisne and Brimont.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1915 it was still holding the lines in the vicinity\r\nof Rheims. At the end of March the 164th Infantry Regiment was\r\ntransferred to the 111th Division (new formation).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of April, with its regiments raised to four battalions\r\neach, the 20th Division (as well as the 19th Division) was sent to\r\nGalacia, where it took part in the operation of Mackensen’s army. It\r\nlost very heavily there. From July 28 to September 23 the 11th Company\r\nof the 77th Infantry Regiment received at least 133 men as replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. Brought back to France in September, the 20th Division took part, in\r\nthe month of October, in the battles in the Champagne.\r\n\r\n4. From November, 1915, to June, 1916, it held a sector north of the\r\nAisne (west of Craonne).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. On June 8, 1916, the 20th Division, with all of the 10th Army Corps,\r\nwas transferred again to the Eastern Front. In four days it arrived in\r\nthe Kovel area by way of Berlin and Brest Litowsk.\r\n\r\n2. On June 13 it was engaged in stopping the Russian advance and then\r\noccupied a sector near Kiselin. Its regiments were filled up in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\nFrom June to November the losses of the 92d Infantry Regiment had\r\naveraged 160 men per company. (Statements of deserters.) This is the\r\nnumber of the replacements received during the same period by the 9th\r\nCompany of the 77th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. The 20th Division was relieved on November 11 and entrained on the\r\n15th for France. Itinerary: Warsaw-Kalich-Berlin-Dusseldorf-Aix la\r\nChapelle-Liége-Namur. Billeted first in the area of Anor Hirson, the\r\n20th Division was sent to the Sissonne Camp, where its regiments\r\nreceived training.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of December the division took over the sector of Moulin\r\nsous Touvent, Chevillecourt, where it was relieved on January 30, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1917, the 20th Division was transferred to Alsace\r\n(Sundgau) in anticipation of a French offensive.\r\n\r\n2. In the beginning of March it was brought back to the Laon area, where\r\nit was billeted until the French attack of April 16; its regiments\r\nreceived some replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n3. In the night of April 16 all the units of the division were\r\nassembled. On April 17–18 they took their positions along the plateau of\r\nthe Chemin des Dames on both sides of Cerny en Laonnois, relieving the\r\n16th Reserve Division, which had suffered heavy losses. Between April 18\r\nand May 5 the three regiments of the 20th Division suffered heavy losses\r\nfrom bombardments. On May 5 (renewal of the general attack by the\r\nFrench) the division again lost heavily. It was relieved immediately\r\nafter the attack. (Apr. 27 to Aug. 10, the 10th Company of the 77th\r\nInfantry Regiment had received not less than 211 men as replacements.)\r\n\r\n4. After a few weeks of rest, the division was put into line (end of\r\nMay) in a sector of Champagne (Moronvilliers).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. In the beginning of July it was relieved and transferred for a third\r\ntime to the Russian front, first in Galicia and then in Courland. It\r\nremained there until September 19. At this date it entrained at Riga and\r\nwas brought back to France by way of Chavli, Kovno, Grodno, Bromberg,\r\nBerlin, Hanover, Cologne, Aix la Chapelle, Mons, Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. Arriving at Roulers on September 27, it immediately went into action\r\nin an attacking sector, north of Zonnebeke, without having any rest, on\r\nOctober 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved almost immediately, it was put into line on October 17 in\r\nthe Queant sector, where it still was at the beginning of February,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nIt is recruited from the Province of Hanover in the Duchy of Brunswick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIt had very heavy losses on May 5, 1917 (many killed, 700 prisoners),\r\nwhich, joined to the preceding losses, lessened the value of the 20th\r\nDivision very much.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that two weeks before the attack of May 5 the units of\r\nthe division defended themselves obstinately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved by the 119th Division about the middle of\r\nJanuary; it, in turn, relieved the 119th Division during the first week\r\nin February. It was relieved by the 195th Division on February 16, and\r\nmarched to Aubigny au Bac; it reached Basaecles (southeast of Tournai)\r\nthe 18th. Here it was given a month’s course of training in open\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n2. On March 14 the division marched to Peruwelz and then via St. Amand-\r\nLourches-Bouchain, arriving at Pronville, where it entered line on the\r\n20th. It advanced through Noreuil, Bapaume, Grevillers, Irles, and\r\nMiraumont. During this fighting the division suffered severely, its\r\ncasualties amounting to 50 per cent of its effectives; very few officers\r\nleft. It did not advance with the rest of the line during the night of\r\nthe 24–25th, its place being taken by the 24th Division. It followed in\r\nsupport of the line, however, and relieved the 24th Division east of\r\nColincamps on the 29th. A document captured on the 28th shows that the\r\nstrength of the 3d Battalion of the 77th Regiment (excluding the machine\r\ngun company) was reduced to 214 men. Another battalion was reduced to 80\r\nmen and 1 officer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn early in April, and was sent to the Mars\r\nla Tour region, where it rested and was reconstituted. About the 20th it\r\nrelieved the 82d Reserve Division in the Seuzey-Lamorville-Spada sector\r\n(north of St. Mihiel); relieved toward the end of the month, it went to\r\nthe Arlon area, where it received large drafts (in large part of the\r\n1919 class), and where it was put through a long and thorough course of\r\ntraining. Toward the end of June it was transported to the Sedan area,\r\nfrom which it marched (about July 15) toward Soissons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n4. On the 21st of July the division reinforced the front near\r\nVillemontoire (south of Soissons). Here heavy losses were again\r\nsuffered. It was relieved by the 50th Reserve Division on the 29th and\r\nwent to rest in the Chimay area, where it received a draft from the\r\ndisbanded 260th Reserve Regiment (78th Reserve Division).\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n5. On the night of the 27–28th of August the division moved up into the\r\nDrocourt-Queant line, south of Drocourt, and during the following days\r\nwent into line in the Oppy sector (northeast of Arras), where a British\r\nattack was expected. The division was withdrawn again during the night\r\nof September 1–2.\r\n\r\n6. On the 3d of September it came into line near Ecourt St. Quentin\r\n(south of Arleux), and covered the withdrawal across the Canal du Nord.\r\nIt was withdrawn on the 10th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n7. On the 12th it counterattacked in the Havrincourt sector (southwest\r\nof Cambrai). During the subsequent fighting the division suffered heavy\r\nlosses. It was withdrawn on the 1st of October.\r\n\r\n8. After a few days’ rest it relieved the 21st Division in the\r\nMontbrehain sector (southeast of Cambrai), where it fought until the\r\n13th, when it was relieved and went to the vicinity of Montmedy, where\r\nit rested for about three weeks. Losses, 70 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n9. The division was expected to enter line west of the Meuse, but the\r\norders were changed suddenly, and it entered line to the east of it near\r\nReville on November 5. It remained in line until the 11th, not being\r\nheavily engaged, however, all the prisoners captured subsequently\r\nstating that they were members of rear-guard detachments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 20th is rated as a first-class division. It fought well throughout\r\nthe year and suffered enormous losses. Besides the replacements already\r\nnoted, the division received a large draft from its recruit depot in\r\nSeptember (about 50 men per company); September 28, the 92d Regiment\r\nreceived 93 men; October 30, the companies received 30 men apiece from\r\nthe 27th Reserve Regiment (197th Division, dissolved); the companies had\r\na combat strength of 80 to 100 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        20th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[14]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │384 Ldw. │9 Ers.   │384 Ldw. │9 Ers.   │386 Ldw.\r\n              │         │386 Ldw. │         │386 Ldw. │         │\r\n              │         │387 Ldw. │         │387 Ldw. │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │3 Sqn. 4 Res.

The 20th Landwehr Division dates from September 29, 1916. It was\r\nformed at Roulers from the 384th, 386th, and 387th Landwehr Regiments.\r\nThese regiments, formed at this time, respectively, at Menin, Renaix,\r\nand Cooescant, were formed two-thirds of men from the Landsturm\r\nbattalions assigned to the Service of Supplies in Belgium, and one-third\r\nof returned wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIXMUDE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of October, 1916, the 20th Landwehr Division\r\nrelieved the 206th Division in the sector Dixmude-Schoorbakke.

In August, 1914, it formed a part of the 4th Army (Duke of\r\nWurttemberg). Entering Luxemburg on August 10, Belgium August 12, it\r\nfought on the 20th at Neuf Chateau, on the 22d at Bertrix and Orgeo, on\r\nthe 24th at Matton, and crossed the Meuse on the 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n2. In September it took part in the battle of the Marne between Vitry\r\nand Sermaize (Etrepy, Pargny sur Saulx). From there it retired in the\r\ndirection of Rheims, being in action northwest of the city from\r\nSeptember 15 to 20.\r\n\r\n3. In October it was reassigned with the 18th Army Corps to the 2d Army,\r\nwhich at this time formed the right flank of the German Army (vicinity\r\nof Roye).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. It was retained with its army corps for a year in the vicinity of\r\nRoye (until Oct. 15, 1915). In March, the 25th Division transferred the\r\n88th Infantry Regiment for the formation of the 56th Division.\r\n\r\n2. On October 15, 1915, it was withdrawn from the front and sent for a\r\nlong rest near St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\nThe 80th Fusiliers took part in the attack at Frise on January 29, 1916.\r\nA few days afterwards the 21st Division was transferred north of Verdun.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. From February 27 to March 16 it was engaged at Verdun (Caures wood,\r\nLouvemont, Douaumont).\r\n\r\n2. From March 17 to April 9 it was reorganized (imperial review on Apr.\r\n1, at Marville).\r\n\r\n3. From April 10 to 25 it again attacked at Verdun. One may judge of the\r\nlosses by the replacements destined to make them good: From February 27\r\nto May 10 the 1st Company of the 80th Fusiliers received at least 205\r\nmen; the 5th Company of the 81st Infantry Regiment at least 306\r\n(Soldbuecher). The total losses of the 21st Division from March 15 to\r\nMay 19, 1916, amounted to 8,549 officers and privates for the infantry\r\nalone. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n4. About May 15 the 21st Division occupied the sector west of Craonne,\r\nwhere it was relieved in September. Two battalions of the 87th Infantry\r\nRegiment were sent in haste to Fricourt at the time of the Somme\r\noffensive (July 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. Between September 12 and 15 the 21st Division was transferred to the\r\nSomme (sectors of Clery-Bouchavesnes), where it suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of October it was withdrawn from the Somme front and\r\nsent to the Cotes de Meuse in the Apremont area, which it occupied until\r\nNovember 10.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of November it again went into action on the Somme (sector\r\nof Gomiecourt wood of Kratz) and remained there until February 10, when\r\nit went to rest near Chaumont Porcien.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. On February 26, 1917, the 21st Division was taken to the front south\r\nof Berry au Bac, between the Godat and Loivre.\r\n\r\n2. The three regiments of the division were on line on April 16 and\r\nunderwent our attack, which caused them very heavy losses (2,319\r\nprisoners).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved, about April 19, the 21st Division rested for a few days in\r\nthe Neufchatel area and then entrained for the Eastern Front (about May\r\n9). On the 16th it detrained at Vilna. After reorganization, it took\r\nover a sector, on June 14, in the neighborhood of Postavy (north of Lake\r\nNarotch), which it occupied until the end of September. There was no\r\nimportant operation during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. On September 25 it was again transferred to France. Itinerary: Vilna-\r\nPosen-Leipzig-Frankfort on the Main-Saarebruecken-Luxemburg-Sedan.\r\n\r\n5. Arriving from Russia on October 1, it went into line about the 28th,\r\nin the sector northeast of Rheims. After a rest in January, it returned\r\nthere in February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Division is recruited in Hesse-Nassau, Hesse-Homburg, and\r\nFrankfort. They have borrowed very few from other districts, except from\r\nthe 8th (Rhine Province), its neighbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Division showed itself, in the course of our attack of April\r\n16, 1916, as a good division, which put up a serious resistance.\r\n\r\nThe 81st Infantry Regiment, however, was criticised for its conduct on\r\nApril 4. (Order of the 42d Brigade, of Apr. 9.) (See Appendix to the\r\nBritish Summary of Information of May 12, 1917.)\r\n\r\nOn the Russian front, according to the statement of a deserter (Nov. 7,\r\n1917), the attempts at fraternization and exchange of the Russians were\r\nbadly received by order of the German commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Clonay-La Pompelle sector until April 23. A\r\nlocal operation was attempted on March 1, with the demolition of Fort La\r\nPompelle as the objective.\r\n\r\n2. When relieved on April 23, the division rested several days at\r\nWarmeriville before being transported to St. Quentin. From there it\r\nmarched by stages to Rosieres en Santerre (May 1) and later to the Avre\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n3. It relieved the 2d Bavarian Division, on May 3–4 in the sector south\r\nof Thennes and held that sector for five weeks. On June 12, the division\r\nmoved into second line, and reappeared in line west of Castel-Bois\r\nSenecat in mid-June. During local operations, June 26 and July 2, the\r\ndivision lost a number of prisoners. It was relieved about the end of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\nThe division returned to line on August 13 to oppose the British drive\r\non the Somme. It was engaged north of Lihons (13th) and east of Proyart.\r\nToward the end of August it was forced to retreat through Cappy, Frise,\r\nClery, and Le Mont St. Quentin, until its relief on September 1. Twelve\r\nhundred prisoners were lost during the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA CHATEAU.\r\n\r\n5. On September 9, the division was reengaged northwest of Jeancourt for\r\nfour days, again losing heavily in prisoners. From the 13th to the 30th\r\nthe division rested in the vicinity of St. Quentin, close to the front.\r\nIt was put back in line at Bellicourt on the 30th and remained in until\r\nOctober 7.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested in the Charleroi area and later at Ghent. It was\r\nbrought back to the front by stages and reengaged east of Deynze\r\n(Petegem-Ouest de Nazareth) on October 31. In the closing days, the\r\ndivision was identified south of Heurne (Nov. 5), Gelsen (8th), Wendle\r\n(8th), south of Ghent (10th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. In 1918 it was used entirely on\r\nthe defensive. At the end the regiments had been reduced to two\r\nbattalions of three companies. Morale was very low in the fall. Between\r\nAugust 14 and the middle of October the division lost 2,473 prisoners on\r\nthe Somme battle front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         21st Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │41 Res.  │80 Res.  │41 Res.  │80 Res.  │41 Res.  │80 Res.\r\n              │         │87 Res.  │         │87 Res.  │         │87 Res.\r\n              │42 Res.  │81 Res.  │42 Res.  │81 Res.  │42 Res.  │81 Res.\r\n              │         │88 Res.  │         │88 Res.  │         │88 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │7 Res.

At the outbreak of the war the 21st Reserve Division formed, with the\r\n25th Reserve Division, the 18th Reserve Corps. It belonged to the 4th\r\nArmy (Prince Albrecht of Wurttemberg). Detraining near Saarburg (Rhine\r\nProvince) on August 10–12, it passed to the north of Luxemburg and\r\nentered Belgian Luxemburg, by Martelange.\r\n\r\n\r\nARDENNES.\r\n\r\n2. After fighting at Neufchateau on August 22, the 21st Reserve Division\r\nreached Carignan on the 25th, fought at Mouzon on the 28th, crossed the\r\nMeuse at that point, and from there, by Grandpré, skirting the Argonne\r\nto the west, it arrived at the Marne-Rhine Canal on September 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE-CHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. At the battle of the Marne it went into action on the Saulx in the\r\nvicinity of Mognéville (Sept. 7–10, south of Revigny). It effected its\r\nretreat by way of the Givry en Argonne, Ste. Menehould, Vienne la Ville,\r\nand stopped on the heights to the south of Cernay en Dormois on\r\nSeptember 14.\r\n\r\n4. The 21st Reserve Division established its positions in the sector of\r\nVille sur Tourbe and remained there until June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. From January to December, 1915, the division was in the sector of\r\nVille sur Tourbe north of Massiges à L’Aisne.\r\n\r\n2. In September the division took part in the Champagne battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 21st Reserve Division continued to occupy the Massiges sector\r\nfrom January to June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. After a rest in the Briey area from the end of June until July 15,\r\nthe division was sent to Verdun (sector of Fumin wood) where it went\r\ninto action from July 15–25 to the beginning of September. During this\r\nperiod it suffered heavy losses, which made it necessary to give men as\r\nreplacements on August 12, taken from the 83d Landwehr Regiment and the\r\n36th Reserve Infantry Regiment, taken in haste from the Argonne; at the\r\nend of August it received conscripts of the 1917 class who had only been\r\ncalled up in May, many of whom came from depots in Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of September, the 21st Reserve Division came back\r\ninto its own sector of Ville sur Tourbe. A short time afterwards it gave\r\nthe 81st Reserve Infantry Regiment to the 222d Division a new formation.\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of October it was sent to rest in the Rethel area.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n5. On August 26 and 27 it was concentrated in the vicinity of Senon-\r\nFoameix. It occupied the sector of Hardaumont until December 7. After a\r\nfew days’ rest it was brought back into line at Verdun (Bezonvaux, on\r\nDec. 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division left the Verdun front on January 11, 1917, very much\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. On February 24, 1917, it took over the sector Letricourt-Moncel in\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. After a few days’ rest at Morhange it entrained on April 14 for the\r\nAisne. Detraining between Hirson and Vervins, it was concentrated in the\r\nvicinity of Prouvais-Amifontaine. On April 18 and 19, after the French\r\nadvance of April 16 in the vicinity of Juvincourt, it took up its\r\nposition between the Miette and the Aisne as a reenforcement division,\r\nand then to replace units in the line. It attacked on May 18, near the\r\nMauchamp Farm, and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved between the 27th and 30th of May, it was sent to rest and\r\nreorganized (June replacements; mostly men of the 1918 class).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. It then occupied a sector in Champagne southwest of Nauroy from July\r\n19–20 to October 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. After a rest in the vicinity of Cambrai in November, it went into\r\naction at the end of November, east of Cambrai (southeast of Bourlon).\r\nIt remained in line south of the Bapaume-Cambrai road until the end of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is recruited in Hesse-Nassau and the extreme southern part\r\nof Westphalia. It received few outside elements except under exceptional\r\ncircumstances (e. g., on Aug. 12, 1916, at Verdun).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Reserve Division is a good division. (October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nOn the Aisne front (April to May, 1917) the 21st Reserve Division held a\r\ndifficult sector. The unsuccessful counterattacks which it launched\r\nthere diminished its offensive value. Nevertheless, on the whole, it\r\ngave a good account of itself.\r\n\r\nIn Champagne (August to October, 1917) its activity was limited to a few\r\nassaults carried out energetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. In the March offensive the division advanced from la Vacquerie to\r\nBeaumont Hamel, which it reached on March 27. Here the line stabilized\r\nand it held this sector throughout April, May, and June. It was relieved\r\nby the 16th Reserve Division on the night of July 3–4.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested in the Bapaume area until it returned to line\r\nnorthwest of Hamelincourt on August 6–7, relieving the 5th Bavarian\r\nDivision. It met the British attack in the region and was driven back\r\nthrough Croisilles, Cherisy, and St. Leger until its withdrawal on\r\nAugust 30. Nine hundred prisoners were lost in the engagement.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in the Tournai area until September 18, when it\r\nreenforced the front south of Villers-Guislain. About this time the 81st\r\nReserve Regiment was broken up and distributed among the regiments of\r\nthe 21st Reserve Division. The division fought at Gouzeaucourt (28th),\r\nGonnelieu (30th), Banteux (30th), Gouy (Oct. 3), Beaurevoir (5th),\r\nVillers Outreaux (8th), Clary (9th), Le Cateau (11th). After losing\r\n1,550 prisoners the division was withdrawn on October 17. According to a\r\ndivisional order of October 1, the strength was so low as to warrant the\r\nreduction in half of the normal allotment of kitchen and supply wagons.\r\n\r\n4. The division returned from close reserve on October 23 northeast of\r\nHaussy. In the closing days it fought at Vendegies (24th), Ruesnes\r\n(24th), Orsinval (Nov. 2), southwest of Wargnies le Grand (4th), east of\r\nVillers Pol and in the Gommegnies sector (5th). The division withdrew on\r\nNovember 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. During 1918 its service was\r\nentirely in the area north and south of the Somme, where it saw a great\r\ndeal of heavy fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        21st Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │11 Ldw.      │20 Ldw.      │11 Ldw.      │20 Ldw.\r\n              │             │35 Ldw.      │             │35 Ldw.\r\n              │             │435 Ldw.     │             │435 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 6 Cuirassier Rgt.   │4 Sqn. 6 Cuirassier Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │Art.

The 21st Landwehr Division was formed in April, 1917, by the addition\r\nof the 435th Regiment to the two regiments of the 11th Landwehr Brigade.\r\nThis brigade, until then independent, had come to Belgium the 2d of\r\nAugust, 1914, had detached certain of its elements in Picardy, from the\r\nend of September to the end of November, and had fought near Ypres in\r\nNovember and December. From March to October, 1915, it acted as garrison\r\nat Brussels and Antwerp. At the end of December, 1915, it reappeared on\r\nthe Belgian front between Dixmude and Ypres (from Steenstraat to the\r\nYpres-Zonnebeke road).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. In May, 1917, the 21st Landwehr Division was identified in the\r\nvicinity of Arras. On May 16 it entrained for the Eastern Front.\r\nItinerary: Liege-Aix la Chapelle-Paderborn-Halle-Posen-Warsaw.\r\nDetraining at Brest-Litovsk on May 21, it remained in training for 10\r\ndays, was then sent to the Niémen front, and occupied the Vichnev sector\r\nuntil March, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Landwehr Division did work in the service of supplies in\r\nBelgium and held very calm sectors in Russia. Its offensive value seems\r\nmediocre.\r\n\r\nOn the Russian front in January, 1918, the 20th Landwehr Regiment\r\nreceived 600 men of the 1919 class in exchange for its men of 25 to 35\r\nyears of age sent to the Western Front. Before being brought back to\r\nFrance in March, 1918, the 35th Landwehr Regiment left its older men in\r\nRussia and received 900 men of 19 to 30 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Badonviller sector from April 29 until the\r\narmistice. The division was strong in the number of effectives, but\r\ntheir quality and morale was low. The division was rated as a fourth-\r\nclass division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             22d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │43.      │82.      │43.      │82.      │43.      │82.\r\n              │         │83.      │         │83.      │         │83.\r\n              │44.      │32.      │44.      │32.      │         │167.\r\n              │         │167.     │         │167.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │6 Cuirassier Rgt.  │                   │6 Cuirassier Rgt.\r\n              │  (3 Sqns.).       │                   │  (2 Sqns.).\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │22 Brig.:          │22 Brig.:          │22 Brig.:\r\n              │ 11 F.

The 22d Division formed a part of the 11th Army Corps (Cassel) with\r\nthe 38th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n2. One of its brigades, the 43d, was sent to Liege and entrained on\r\nAugust 2–3, 1914. The other rejoined it there and after the surrender of\r\nthe city the 22d Division, with the rest of the 11th Army Corps, formed\r\na part of the 3d Army (Von Hausen). It went to Namur and then to Eastern\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. In October the 22d Division (and the 11th Army Corps) was in Poland,\r\nwhere it remained until May, 1915. It took part in the violent attacks\r\nalong the Bzura and the Rawka.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the division gave the 32d Infantry Regiment to the\r\n103d Division (a new formation).\r\n\r\n2. In July it was separated from the 38th Division. It took part in the\r\noffensive of the 11th Army (Mackensen), and arrived on the Styr in\r\nOctober. It then formed a part of the 4th Austrian Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In the spring of 1916 the 22d Division was in the rear of Vilna\r\n(May), after having been at Mitau. On June 11 it entrained at Mitau for\r\nVilna.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. It then formed a part of the troops destined to withstand the Russian\r\noffensive in Galicia and took up its position on the Lipa.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n3. In December it was sent to Roumania and operated in Moldavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. It returned in January, 1917, to the 4th Austrian Army on the Lipa.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July it was in Volhynia (Mikolajow, northwest of\r\nBrody).\r\n\r\n3. On July 7–9 the division was relieved and sent to the area south of\r\nTarnopol. It arrived there on July 15 and took part in the offensive\r\nagainst the Russians. It suffered rather heavy losses in the beginning,\r\nthe Russians having resisted for several days.\r\n\r\n4. The 22d Division remained in this area until October 7. On this date\r\nit was relieved and entrained for the Western Front (itinerary:\r\nBrzezany-Torgau-Erfurt-Frankfort on the Main-Mayence-Sarrebrucken-\r\nThionville-Montmedy), detraining at Douzy (east of Sedan) about October\r\n14.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October the division, after a few days of rest, was put in\r\nline in the Forges sector (Verdun area), where it had a few losses\r\n(November, December). January 1918, it was on the front north of Verdun\r\n(right bank of the Meuse).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Division is recruited from the electorate of Hesse. Alsace-\r\nLorrainers were numerous during its stay on the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Division, coming from Russia, where it had had rather easy\r\nvictories, appeared to have a relatively good morale. Its spirit,\r\nhowever, did not appear very combative (Nov. 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in line on the right bank of the Meuse (Samogneux-\r\nCote 344) from January, 1918, to the end of May, when it was relieved by\r\nthe 6th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n2. It was in reserve southwest of Reims on June 16, and came into line\r\nat Anthenay on June 20. About the 1st of July the 103d Division relieved\r\nthe 22d Division, which went to rest in the neighborhood of Fismes and\r\nHourges.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was engaged southeast of Ville en Tardenois (Chambrecy,\r\nChamplat, Velval) July 15–26. It fell back in the line Romigny-Ville en\r\nTardenois and was relieved on August 7. About 400 prisoners were lost in\r\nthis fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested in the Cambrai area until August 29, when it was\r\nmoved up to the line. On the 1st of September it was engaged on the\r\nArras-Cambrai road near Bullecourt. The British attack rolled it back on\r\nInchy and Marquion, where it was withdrawn on the 10th. The division\r\nlost 1,100 prisoners in the week of fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCARPE.\r\n\r\n5. It rested until September 28, when it came into line north of Cambrai\r\n(Epinoy), Sancourt, Blécourt. About October 1 it was moved north and\r\nrelieved the 48th Reserve Division north of the Scarpe. In the sector it\r\nfought until October 23 (south east of Lille, St. Amand, southwest of\r\nOdomez).\r\n\r\n6. Upon its relief, the division marched from Thulin, west of Mons, on\r\nOctober 24 to the Le Quesnoy area, and on the next day relieved the\r\n185th Division east of Gussignies. In November it was in the fighting\r\naround Le Quesnoy and Gommegnies until its withdrawal on November 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was employed in the July\r\noffensive, but made little headway. On the defensive the division\r\nappears to have done better than many divisions of a higher rating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         22d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │43 Res.  │71 Res.  │43 Res.  │71 Res.  │43 Res.  │71 Res.\r\n              │         │94 Res.  │         │94 Res.  │         │82 Res.\r\n              │44 Res.  │32 Res.  │44 Res.  │32 Res.  │         │94 Res.\r\n              │         │82 Res.  │         │82 Res.  │         │\r\n              │ 11 Res.

At the beginning of the war the 22d Reserve Division formed the 4th\r\nReserve Corps with the 7th Reserve Division. It was a part of the 1st\r\nArmy (Von Kluck).\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated at Dusseldorf (Aug. 10) the 22d Reserve Division reached\r\nBrussels by way of Aix la Chapelle, Tongres, and Louvain. The 94th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment remained at Brussels until September 5, when\r\nit was hastily called to rejoin the division. The 71st Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment remained there until August 31 and then figured in the battle\r\nof the Marne on September 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n3. The 44th Reserve Brigade joined to the 7th Reserve Division went to\r\nAth, Conde, Amiens (Aug. 30–31), and Creil (Sept. 2), almost without\r\ncombat, but by forced marches to the extreme right flank of the 1st\r\nArmy. In action on the right bank of the Ourcq, it withdrew to the north\r\nof the Aisne.\r\n\r\n4. The 43d Reserve Brigade, of which only one regiment had fought with\r\nthe 44th from September 6 to 9 was filled upon the 9th and went to\r\nPeronne. On September 11, strengthened by the 72d Reserve Regiment,\r\ndetached from the 7th Reserve Division, it was concentrated north of\r\nCompiegne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACY LE MONT.\r\n\r\n5. Until September 20 the 43d Reserve Brigade fought in the vicinity of\r\nTracy le Mont with some elements of the 7th Reserve Division. The 44th\r\nReserve Brigade was engaged with the majority of this division on the\r\nNouvron Plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOUVRON.\r\n\r\n6. On September 20 the 43d Reserve Brigade rejoined the 44th\r\n(Hautebraye-Chevillecourt.)\r\n\r\n7. On November 12 elements of the division took part in the attack on\r\nthe Nouvron Plateau and suffered rather heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 22d Reserve Division occupied the lines between the Aisne and the\r\nOise until the autumn of 1915.\r\n\r\n2. In January, 1915, elements of the division took part in the battle\r\naround Soissons. In April, 1915, the 32d Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\nbecame a part of the 113th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of October the 22d Reserve Division left the area\r\nnorthwest of Soissons to go to Champagne (Souain sector).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 22d Reserve Division left Champagne at the end of January, 1916;\r\nit went to rest at Attigny, which it left on February 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. From March 1 to 5, at the height of the Verdun offensive, the\r\ndivision was reassembled between Dun and Vilosnes behind the front. On\r\nMarch 6 it attacked on the left bank of the Meuse. It took part in the\r\noperations in this sector (valley of the Forges and Corbeaux wood) until\r\nthe middle of April. In the first attacks of March the 6th Company of\r\nthe 82d Reserve Infantry Regiment required replacements of 90 men, among\r\nwhom were recruits from the 1916 class. After a few days of rest the 22d\r\nReserve Division again attacked at Verdun, south of Corbeaux wood and\r\nnear the Mort Homme (May 23 to beginning of June). It lost very heavily.\r\nIts attacks at Verdun had cost it 90 per cent of its infantry. From\r\nApril 24 to June 26 the 1st and 4th Companies of the 11th Battalion of\r\nReserve Chasseurs had each received at least 204 men as replacements;\r\nthe 6th Company of the 94th Reserve Infantry Regiment, from March 9 to\r\nJune 15, 217 men; the 8th Company, 207 men.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested and was reorganized in the vicinity of Fourmies-\r\nHirson; it was then sent between St. Quentin and Tergnier.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of the Somme offensive the 22d Reserve Division was\r\nconcentrated southeast of Peronne on July 2. It went into action south\r\nof the Somme (Biaches-Belloy), and suffered heavy losses (1,500\r\nprisoners between July 2 and July 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to Champagne, it rested for a few days and then went into\r\nline east of Rheims (Auberive sector) and in the Prosnes sector at the\r\nend of August.\r\n\r\n6. At the end of October, after it had rested in the Rethel-Vouziers\r\nsector until November 10, the division was placed behind the Cambrai-St.\r\nQuentin sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. It went back to the Somme at the beginning of December east of\r\nRancourt and remained there until December 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 22d Reserve Division passed the month of January, 1917, at rest\r\nin the Valenciennes area.\r\n\r\n2. In February it took over the Saillisel sector, where it took part in\r\nsecondary action. In March the division took part in the withdrawal and\r\nestablished itself in the Hindenburg line between Gonnelieu and Le\r\nCatelet.\r\n\r\n3. About May 20 the 22d Reserve Division went to rest in the\r\nneighborhood of Lens and Tourcoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. On June 14 it went into line in the Comines sector, west of Warneton,\r\nwhere it remained until the end of June.\r\n\r\n5. After a period of rest north of Lille (end of June to July 23–24) it\r\nwent into action southeast of Zillebeke, where it underwent the British\r\nattack of July 31, and suffered very heavily.\r\n\r\n6. Relieved immediately after the attack, the division was sent to the\r\nBullecourt sector (Aug. 10-Sept. 22).\r\n\r\n7. Until October 5 it rested in the vicinity of Courtrai. At this date\r\nit occupied the Becelaere sector as a counterattacking division,\r\nsupporting the 4th Guard Division, and suffered heavily from\r\nbombardments (Oct. 5–21).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE-ALSACE.\r\n\r\n8. At the beginning of November it was in line in Lorraine, southwest of\r\nDelme, then in Alsace (sector of Aspach south of the Rhone-Rhine Canal\r\nin December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Reserve Division is recruited from the Electorate of Hesse and\r\nThuringia. In case of emergency replacements are occasionally furnished\r\nby neighboring corps districts (8th Corps in June, 1916). At the end of\r\nOctober, 1917, unequally trained men were received from the Eastern\r\nFront (the 71st Infantry Reserve Regiment receiving men from the depot\r\nof the 146th Infantry Regiment, men from the Service of Supplies,\r\nconvalescents, or men of mediocre physical quality).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Reserve Division is a mediocre division (December, 1917). The\r\nunits of the 11th Corps District have generally fought well during the\r\nentire war.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Reserve District lost very heavily in the battles of Verdun and\r\nthe Somme and from artillery fire at Ypres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division left Alsace about April 6 and came into the Lys battle\r\nline on April 16 northeast of Bailleul. Its former sector in the Vosges\r\nwas taken over by an extension of the neighboring divisions. The route\r\nof the division lay through Strasbourg, Treves, Cologne, Verviers,\r\nLiege, Brussels, Courtrai-Roubaix, a journey of two days. The division\r\nparticipated in heavy fighting about Kemmel until its relief on May 1.\r\n\r\n2. When relieved by the 117th Division, it marched to Roubaix, where it\r\nrested for two days. From there it marched to Waereghem, where the 82d\r\nReserve Regiment rested for about eight days. About May 11 the 22d\r\nReserve Division entrained at Audenarde and was railed to Rieux, 5 miles\r\neast of Cambrai. The division marched via Cambrai to the Montauban-\r\nLongueval-Gullemont area, where it went into rest billets. On the night\r\nof May 31-June 1 the 1st Battalion, 82d Reserve Regiment, reenforced the\r\n122d Fusilier Regiment (243d Division) near Avelcy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained in the Cambrai area on June 8 and traveled via\r\nValenciennes-Mons Charleroi-Dinant-Mezieres-Sedan to Ligny sur Meuse,\r\nwhere it detrained on June 9. The next day it relieved the 53d Reserve\r\nDivision east of Bethincourt. It held the sector until about July 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. Entraining at Brieulles, the division moved by Sedan and Vouziers to\r\nSt. Morel and Savigny sur Aisne, where it rested until August 5. On the\r\n6th it came into line in the St. Souplet-Somme Py sector, which it held\r\nuntil August 23.\r\n\r\n5. The division left Champagne and moved from Semide by Laon-La Fere-\r\nTergnier to the Noyon area. Relieved August 24–27, it detrained at Flavy\r\nle Martel and La Fere, and rested a day at Cugny, Petit Detroit, Bois de\r\nGenlis, and Bois de Frieres before moving east of Noyon to cover the\r\nretreat of elements of the 71st Division and the 105th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n6. On August 29 it came into line and held the sector Mont St. Simeon-\r\nBaboeuf. The division resisted the French attack until September 3, when\r\nit fell back slowly toward the Crozat Canal, offering resistance at\r\nBehericourt-Baboeuf (4th), Cuivry-Caillouel-Crepigny-Bethancourt (5th),\r\nand Villequier Aumont (6th). It was relieved on the night of September\r\n7–8 by the 11th Division and rested at Ribemont and then farther north\r\nin the billets at Fontaine Notre Dame, Regny, and Homblieres.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n7. From September 10 to 12 the division was relieving the 75th Reserve\r\nDivision in the sector Castres-Contescourt-Hill 98. The division held in\r\nthis vicinity until September 28 when the British advance north of St.\r\nQuentin compelled it to retreat. Between October 2 and 5 the division\r\nheld the line Harley-Neuville-St. Amand. On the 8th it was again forced\r\nto retreat. The division was relieved on October 15–16. In this fighting\r\nthe division lost at least one-third of its effectives. The battalion\r\nhad but three companies, and the effective strength of the infantry\r\ncompanies averaged about 35. The entire division had but about 1,300\r\ninfantry combatants.\r\n\r\n8. After its relief by the 18th Division on the night of October 15–16,\r\nthe division remained near the front at Grand Verly, Hannappes, and\r\nLesquielles. It was suddenly alerted on October 17 and obliged to return\r\nto support the 18th Division west of Petit Verly. It put up a stiff\r\nresistance on October 18, but was thrown back east of the Sambre Canal,\r\nlosing a large number of prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the closing week the division was at Favril (5th), Marvilles (6th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was heavily engaged at Kemmel\r\nin April, after which it did not appear in an active front until the\r\nautumn. The division resisted the Allied advance on the St. Quentin area\r\nin September and October with great tenacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         22d Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │         1918[15]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │6 Ldw.       │34 Ldw.      │             │34 Ldw.

The 22d Landwehr Division was formed on the Eastern Front in the\r\nvicinity of Riga, at the end of March, 1917. The 6th Landwehr Brigade,\r\nwhich entered into its composition, had belonged to the 1st Landwehr\r\nDivision (former Jacobi Division), then had become independent when the\r\nlatter left the Riga front to go to Volhynia. It is then that the\r\naddition of the 10th Landsturm Battalion to the Mitau group made the 22d\r\nLandwehr Division from the 6th Landwehr Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n2. From April to October, 1917, the 22d Landwehr Division remained on\r\nthe Riga front (vicinity of Olai).\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n3. In October, it was transferred to the west of Kachovka (Volhynia),\r\nwhere it remained until February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 22d Landwehr Division remained on the Russian front from the time of\r\nits formation, March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n1.

The 23d Division, on mobilization, was a part of the 12th Army Corps\r\nwith the 32d Division (2d Army, Von Hausen). It detrained on August\r\n9–11, 1914, at Eifel, north of Treves, and entered Belgium on the 18th\r\nby the north of Luxemburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n2. It went into action on August 23 at Dinant, crossed the Meuse on the\r\n24th, entered France on the 26th, went to the west of Chalons and took\r\npart in the battle of the Marne on September 7 at Sompuis (west of Vitry\r\nle Francois).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. The 23d Division, with the 2d Army Corps, established itself in the\r\narea northwest of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the front Craonne-Berry au Bac until July, 1916. In\r\nthis sector the losses were very slight.\r\n\r\n2. In March, 1915, some of its elements were in Champagne for a short\r\ntime. In April, the 182d Infantry Regiment was taken for the 123d\r\nDivision (a new formation).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. On July 3, 1916, at the beginning of the Franco-English offensive,\r\nthe 23d Division detached some elements of the 101st and 108th Regiments\r\nto reinforce the divisions engaged in the attack (region of Sovecourt-\r\nVermandovillers).\r\n\r\n2. From the end of July and until the 1st of September the 100th\r\nGrenadier Regiment was incorporated in a new division (Franke Division),\r\nwhich held the front from Deniecourt to Vermandovillers.\r\n\r\n3. The other regiments of the 23d Division continued to occupy the\r\nsector of Craonne-Berry au Bac until the end of August.\r\n\r\n4. On September 4 the 101st and 108th Regiments, coming from Berry au\r\nBac, were sent to the Somme. They suffered considerable losses.\r\n\r\n5. About September 15 the 23d Division was regrouped with its normal\r\nelements (the Franke Division being dissolved) and received 2,700 men as\r\nreplacements (men of the Landstrum called in April and May and young men\r\nof the 1917 class, most of them having had not more than two or three\r\nmonths’ service. The 12th Company of the 100th Grenadier Regiment\r\nreceived at least 108 men as replacements on September 20).\r\n\r\n6. From October 1 to 6 the 23d Division went back into line between the\r\nChaulnes Railroad and the south of Vermandovillers. It again lost very\r\nheavily during the time it remained in line until October 20. (The 2d\r\nCompany of the 108th Riflemen received, on Oct. 27, replacements of at\r\nleast 97 men, most of whom were returned wounded and convalescents.\r\nSince Sept. 17 it had received at least 198 newcomers; the same holds\r\ntrue for the 4th Company of the 104th Grenadier Regiment).\r\n\r\n7. Relieved about October 25, the division was sent to a sector in the\r\nRoye (Beuvraignes) area in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. It occupied this sector (between Armancourt and Roye) until the\r\nmoment of the German retirement and retired to St. Quentin on March 25,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved and sent to rest at the beginning of April in the Sedan\r\narea, it went up in the middle of the month to the sector in Champagne\r\nbetween Hill 232 (east of Nauroy) and the Suippe.\r\n\r\n3. On April 19 the 101st and 108th Infantry Regiments counterattacked\r\nenergetically and in very good order between the Teton and the Suippe\r\nand obtained some local success for a short time. On April 20 the 100th\r\nInfantry Regiment went into action in its turn.\r\n\r\n4. Upon the conclusion of these operations, the 23d Division took up its\r\nposition on the new front (west of Auberive) and remained there until\r\nthe beginning of December, after making up for the heavy losses suffered\r\nin April. At the beginning of January, 1918, the 23d Division went to\r\noccupy the sector of Loivre, northwest of Rheims, and in February the\r\nsector of Courcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 23d Division is purely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 23d Division is very good.\r\n\r\nIt lost very heavily at the time of the offensive, April, 1917, in\r\nChampagne, but still appeared good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1918, the morale of the division seemed high.\r\n\r\n1. The division continued in the sector northwest of Rheims (Courcy-\r\nBrimont) until about February 20, where it was relieved by the 213th\r\nDivision and moved toward the Somme front.\r\n\r\n2. It was transported to Neufchatel on the 23d. From there it proceeded\r\nby stages to north of Guise (Esqueheries, La Neuville-le-Dorengt). It\r\nrested and underwent training in this area until March 18. It marched by\r\nnight toward the front by way of Bohain, Fresnoy le Grand (where the\r\nKaiser inspected it), Le Verguier (evening of Mar. 21–22).\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division followed the advance in third line from March 22 to 29\r\nthrough Holnon, Beauvois, Athies, St. Christ, Chaulnes, Rosieres,\r\nBeaucourt en Santerre. It was engaged from March 29 to April 3\r\n(Mezieres, Villers aux Erables, La Neuville Sire Bernard). Its advance\r\ncontinued to a line east of Mailly-Rainval, Sauvillers. It was in second\r\nline from April 2 to 7, when it returned to line near Grievesnes until\r\nApril 13. The division’s losses were estimated to have been about 70 per\r\ncent in the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. When withdrawn from the Somme, on the 13th, the division was moved to\r\nChampagne and took over a quiet sector east of Auberive on the 31st,\r\nwhich it held until June 6. While in line the division was\r\nreconstituted.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested in the vicinity of Bazoches from June 5 to 15,\r\nundergoing intensive training. It came into line on the night of June\r\n19–20 at St. Pierre Aigle, relieving the 45th Reserve Division. It was\r\nretired from the front at Villers Cotterets about July 1. It rested near\r\nBraisne until the 12th, when it marched toward the Marne front (Foret de\r\nRis) on July 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n6. It reinforced the battle front southwest of Dormans on the 15th. It\r\ncrossed the Marne east of Courcelles north of Sawigny and advanced to La\r\nChapelle Monthodon. On the 17th it was checked and rolled back by the\r\nForet de Fere to Fresnes (south of Fere en Tardenoise, July 26).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n7. The division was withdrawn about the end of July and went to Chimay\r\nto rest. On August 13 it entrained and moved to the Douai area via\r\nValenciennes, where it came into line on August 24 southwest of Arras.\r\nThe British attack forced it to give way to the line Beugny-Morchies,\r\nwith a loss of 700 prisoners. On the 5th the division withdrew from\r\nline.\r\n\r\n8. The division rested until September 27, when it appeared in line\r\nnortheast of Bixschoote, southeast of the forest of Houthulst. After\r\nfive days of heavy fighting it was withdrawn from line. Eight hundred\r\nprisoners were taken from the division. It was at rest near Gits until\r\nthe 14th, when it was again engaged north of Roulers until October 20.\r\nOn that date it passed to second line southeast of Ghent, where it was\r\nagain in contact with the Allies on November 8.

The 23d Reserve Division, forming on mobilization the 12th Reserve\r\nCorps, with the 24th Reserve Division, was a part in 1914 of the 3d\r\nGerman Army (Von Hausen). It detrained on August 12–13 at Wengerohr\r\n(Coblentz-Treves line), remained for a few days on the frontier north of\r\nLuxemburg, and entered Belgium on the 19th. It crossed the Meuse at\r\nAntree, below Dinant (Aug, 23), and entered France on the 27th by way of\r\nPhillipville (Marienburg and Couvin). It went across Champagne by\r\nChateau Porcien, Tagnon, and Le Chatelet (Sept. 1), went to the east of\r\nRheims, crossed the Marne east of Epernay, and reached the railroad from\r\nSezanne to Vitry le Francois between Vassimont and Sommesous on\r\nSeptember 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n2. Engaged in the battle of the Marne, on the extreme right of the 3d\r\nArmy, the 23d Reserve Division suffered heavy losses (Sept. 8–9).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. It retired, by way of Mourmelon, to the region of Moronvilliers\r\nAuberive and took up its position there (end of September).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 23d Reserve Division occupied the Champagne front (Auberive\r\nsector) until the month of July, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. On September 25 it received the French offensive, which caused it\r\nvery heavy losses. At this time the 103d Reserve Infantry Regiment was\r\ndetached from the 23d Reserve Division and assigned to the Liebert\r\nDivision. In October it rejoined the 23d Reserve Division after being\r\nreorganized. Its losses in the Champagne battle had been 140 killed, 751\r\nwounded, and 1,369 missing. On October 2 at least 115 men had been sent\r\nto the 8th Company of the 103d Infantry Regiment as replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 23d Reserve Division was relieved from the sector of Auberive-St.\r\nSouplet sector between July 15 and 20, 1916, and transferred to the\r\nnorth of Peronne.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged in the battle of the Somme (north of Hem to the Monacu\r\nFarm) until August 12–14. The 100th Reserve Grenadier Regiment lost\r\n1,700 men there (letter). The 7th Company of the 103d Infantry Regiment\r\nreceived at least 113 men as replacements between August 1 and 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. After a rest in the vicinity of Douai, the division was sent south of\r\nLens (Angres-Souchez from the beginning of September to Oct. 20). Its\r\ncomposition was modified by the substitution of the 392d Infantry\r\nRegiment, formed by men taken from various Saxon regiments, for the 103d\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. About the middle of October it was again on the Somme (north of\r\nGueudecourt). It remained there for five weeks and suffered very little.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from the Somme on December 3 and 4 the 23d Reserve Division\r\nremained at rest for a few days near Cambrai, and then took over the\r\nsector east of Arras (between Roclincourt and Beaurains). The 101st\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment was transferred to a new Saxon Division, the\r\n119th, and the 23d Reserve Division was reduced to three regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division occupied the Artois front during the winter of 1916–17.\r\n\r\n2. It was withdrawn at the end of March to go to Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest in the Bruges area for a fortnight; it then went in line\r\nfor a month north of Ypres (calm sector).\r\n\r\n4. It was in reserve in June and then went to the front on July 10\r\nbetween the railroad from Ypres to Staden and the Ypres-Roulers\r\nRailroad. In the course of its relief (July 31) it suffered heavily from\r\nthe bombardment which preceded the British attack.\r\n\r\n5. Retained in Flanders, it took part on September 22 in the fighting in\r\nthe Passchendaele sector and underwent the British attack of September\r\n26, which caused it heavy losses. (The 2d Company of the 100th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was reduced to 25 men.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n6. After five days in line the 23d Reserve Division was relieved and\r\ntransferred to Russia, where it arrived on October 8.\r\n\r\n7. It appeared in the Vilna area between October 10 and 17. In the\r\nmiddle of November it was identified near Postavy, where it still was at\r\nthe end of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 23d Reserve Division is purely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 23d Reserve Division was not seriously engaged during the first half\r\nof 1917, but has suffered heavily since that time.\r\n\r\nAfter the losses which it suffered in July, 1917, it received mediocre\r\nreplacements (elderly men and returned convalescents.)\r\n\r\nIf one adds to that the heavy losses which it suffered at Passchendaele\r\nin September, and in its four months’ stay on the Eastern Front, one may\r\nrest assured that the morale and general quality of the division had\r\ndiminished in value for more than a year. (British Summary of\r\nInformation, Feb., 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In March the division was transferred to the Western Front. It\r\nentrained near Dvinsk on March 16 and traveled via Vilna-Koenigsberg-\r\nMarienburg-Schneidemuhl-Berlin-Hanover-Menden-Krefeld-Aix la Chapelle-\r\nHasselt-Louvain-Brussels-Courtrai-Lille, and detrained at Libercourt (16\r\nkm. south of Lille) on March 22. It left for the front on March 26.\r\n\r\nIt came into line in the Oppy sector on March 28. In the attack on this\r\nday all three regiments of the division suffered heavy casualties. The\r\ndivision continued in line in the vicinity until about June 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. When relieved in the Arras sector the division marched north and\r\nrelieved the 15th Reserve Division near Calonne sur la Lys about June\r\n27. In later August the division extended its sector to the south to\r\ninclude the front southwest of Vielle Chapelle, southeast of Merville\r\nand east of Laventie.\r\n\r\nThe division held this front through August and September. On September\r\n30 the resting regiment of the division—the 100th Reserve Regiment—was\r\nsent up to reenforce the Ypres front. It was engaged for two weeks in\r\nthe vicinity of Ledeghem. In October the division was engaged in the\r\nLittle area until about the 20th. It was taken out of line north of\r\nTournai and sent to relieve the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division on the\r\nnight of October 22–23 at Octeghem. It remained in line until a few days\r\nbefore the armistice.

The 23d Landwehr Division, formed at the end of April, 1917, in the\r\nArgonne, was composed of the independent 13th Landwehr Brigade (26th and\r\n27th Landwehr Regiments) and of the 66th Landwehr Regiment taken from\r\nthe 5th Landwehr Division. This latter division furnished the staff of\r\nits infantry brigade (14th Landwehr Brigade).\r\n\r\n2. After being assigned to the 23d Landwehr Division, the 13th Landwehr\r\nBrigade occupied the sector of Boureuilles north of Vienne la Ville in\r\nthe Argonne. It was in the Argonne from September 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. Almost as soon as it was formed the 23d Landwehr Division was\r\ntransferred to the Eastern Front (entraining of the 26th Landwehr\r\nRegiment on May 19). Itinerary: Carignan-Liége—Coblentz-Cassel-Halle-\r\nCottbus-Gnessen-Graudenz-Koenigsberg-Chavli-Poneviej. Going into line\r\nabout May 25 in the vicinity of Illukst (Courland) the division remained\r\nin this sector until February, 1918. It was too much weakened to\r\ncontribute replacements to the division destined to operate in France,\r\nas, for example, the 87th Division. On December 28 the 1st and 2d\r\nCompanies of the 347th Infantry Regiment each received some 75 to 80 men\r\nfrom the 23d Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VALUE.\r\n\r\nThe 23d Landwehr Division is composed entirely of elderly men; in May\r\n1917, the recruit depots of the division furnished men from 40 to 46\r\nyears of age. At the end of 1917 the best elements had been taken for\r\nuse on the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nDVINSK.\r\n\r\n1. Beginning in February, the 23d Landwehr Division occupied the Dvinsk\r\nregion. A man of the division wrote from that city under date of March\r\n15: “We have been here since the 20th of February. The 23d Landwehr\r\nRegiment, to which I belong, is to remain in Russia for guard duty. We\r\nhold the new frontier.” The 26th Landwehr and 27th Landwehr Regiments\r\nand divisional headquarters were identified here on May 9. On the 18th\r\nof May, elements of the 27th Landwehr Regiment were in the vicinity of\r\nRiejitsa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            24th.

The 24th Division belongs to the 19th Army Corps. It is recruited in\r\nthe western part of the Kingdom of Saxony (Leipzig).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n2. At the outbreak of the war it formed a part with the 19th Army Corps,\r\nof the 3d German Army (Von Hausen). One of its brigades, the 48th, sent\r\naway secretly, detrained on August 4 at Pruem (Eifel), and entered the\r\nnorth of Luxemburg on the 5th. The division concentrated in the\r\nHouffalize on August 11, arrived on the banks of the Meuse on the 22d,\r\nwhich it crossed on the 24th and 25th above Dinant. It was at Châlons on\r\nSeptember 5, and took part in the battle of the Marne on the 7th and 8th\r\nbetween Vitry le François and Maisons en Champagne. From there it\r\nreturned to St. Hilaire le Grand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. In October, 1914, the 24th Division went over to the 6th Army (Crown\r\nPrince of Bavaria), and took up its position, which crosses the Lys\r\n(Flanders).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1915, the 106th and 107th Infantry Regiments were\r\ntransferred to the 58th Division. The 24th Division, reduced to two\r\nregiments, was filled up by taking the 133d Infantry Regiment from the\r\n40th Division. The 19th Army Corps retained the Lys sector until the\r\nmonth of August, 1917. It detached elements from its divisions to\r\nreenforce other sectors at various times.\r\n\r\n2. In January, 1915, the 24th Division had elements in action at\r\nL’Epinette.\r\n\r\n3. At the battle of Neuve Chapelle (March, 1915) and at Festubert (May-\r\nJune, 1915), it reinforced the 7th Army Corps.\r\n\r\n4. At the time of the Franco-British offensive in Artois, units of the\r\n24th Division again acted as reenforcements at La Bassee-Souchez (June\r\nand October, 1915).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved at the beginning of August, 1916, in the sector of the Lys,\r\nthe 19th Army Corps was sent, about August 8, to the Somme, north of\r\nPozières, where it suffered considerable losses.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of August it was placed for several weeks in the sector of\r\nNeuve Chapelle-La Bassée, then of Le Sars-Butte de Warlencourt. It took\r\npart a second time in the battle of the Somme (October).\r\n\r\nThe two divisions of the corps suffered very heavily during these two\r\nengagements in the Franco-British offensive. The 24th division lost\r\n6,217 men; that is, 69 per cent of its effectives.\r\n\r\n3. The 24th Division was withdrawn from the Somme about November 11 and\r\ntransferred to Flanders, where it occupied the line between the Ypres-\r\nComines Canal and the Douve (December and the first months of 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. When the British offensive was being prepared on the Wytschaete-\r\nMessines front, the 24th Division was withdrawn from the Ypres-Comines\r\nsector and stationed behind Lille (beginning of April, 1917).\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June it was sent toward the front; the 179th Infantry\r\nRegiment was in action east of Wytschaete on the 8th, and the division\r\noccupied the sector of Hollebeke, where it was retained until June 27.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the division suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved and sent to rest at the end of June, it went back into line\r\nin Belgium (sector southwest of Houthem) during the month of August.\r\n\r\n3. It left the line at the beginning of October, and, after a few days\r\nof rest, again took over a sector in the area southeast of Ypres\r\nnorthwest of Zandvoorde—west of Gheluvelt. It left there at the end of\r\nOctober to go to the south of the Scarpe, at Monchy le Preux, where it\r\nwas still in line at the beginning of February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division is purely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn a general manner, the attitude of the 19th Army Corps has been rather\r\npassive since trench warfare succeeded the war of movement.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the Saxon is a courageous adversary.\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Monchy le Preux sector until about February 11,\r\nwhen it was relieved by the 185th Division and transferred to the area\r\nnorth of Valenciennes to rest and train. On March 16 it began to march\r\ntoward the Cambrai front. The route lay through Raismes, Haveluy,\r\nWallers, Aniche, Aubigny au Bac, Marquion. It reached the original\r\nGerman front line on March 22 at 9 a. m.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division followed the advance in reserve until the night of March\r\n24–25, when it came in line south of Bapaume (Ligny-Tilloy). It advanced\r\nin first line by Grevillers (26th), Achiet le Petit, Hebuterne (27th and\r\n29th). From March 30 to April 5 it was in reserve. On the 6th the\r\ndivision was reengaged near Hebuterne and Bucquoy until April 15.\r\n\r\nAccording to the German press, the Kaiser on March 27 telegraphed the\r\nKing of Saxony felicitating him on the success of the 24th Division.\r\n\r\n3. The division was at rest from April 15 to the end of May, first at\r\nBapaume and later at Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n4. The division was engaged from May 28 to June 16 in the sector of the\r\nBois d’Aveluy (north of Albert). When relieved from this front it went\r\nby railroad to the Cambrai area. The 139th Regiment went into camp at\r\nEswars and St. Martin; the 133d, at Raillencourt; the 179th, at\r\nRamillies and Escaudoewres. The division underwent training and executed\r\ndivisional maneuvers. Between the 5th and 10th of July the division\r\nmarched by Cambrai, Flesquieres, Havrincourt, Bertincourt to the region\r\nHaplincourt Bus for the purpose of reengaging in the Aveluy sector where\r\nthe Germans expected an attack by the English. It remained a week in the\r\nregion and returned to its cantonments in the Cambrai area.\r\n\r\nAbout July 18 an order was issued placing the division at the\r\ndisposition of the 6th Army for a projected offensive in Flanders. This\r\norder was revoked, and about July 20 the division entrained at Ivuy and\r\nSancourt and moved to Chaulnes (via Peronne). It remained in the\r\nvicinity several days and then moved to Quesnel by narrow-gauge\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVRE.\r\n\r\n5. From the 1st of August until the 17th the division opposed a lively\r\nresistance to the French attack in the Avre. In this fighting the\r\ndivision lost 800 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested a week west of Ham. It was engaged west of Coucy\r\nle Chateau (Champs Folembray) from August 30 to September 9. It\r\nretreated about the 9th to Baresis. On October 3 the division was\r\nrelieved north of the St. Gobain-Baresis railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n7. It was moved by trucks to Fontaine-Uterte (north of St. Quentin) and\r\nengaged on October 4 near Sequehart. The division was forced back on\r\nMontbrehain and Andigny. Three hundred and forty-five prisoners were\r\nlost on the 8th. Two days later the division was relieved. On the 17th\r\nthe division was again identified in line at Vaux-Audigny, but was\r\nwithdrawn in a day or two.\r\n\r\n8. It arrived in an area northeast of Fourmies on October 23 and was\r\nstill there on the 26th. No later identification was secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as a third-class division. Its conduct in the\r\nMarch offensive and in the defensive in August and October was above the\r\naverage and would warrant a higher rating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         24th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │47 Res.  │104 Res. │47 Res.  │104 Res. │48 Res.  │104 Res.\r\n              │         │106 Res. │         │106 Res. │         │107 Res.\r\n              │         │13 Res.  │         │13 Res.  │         │133 Res.\r\n              │         │  Jag.   │         │  Jag.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Btn.   │         │  Btn.   │         │\r\n              │48 Res.  │107 Res. │48 Res.  │107 Res. │         │\r\n              │         │133 Res. │         │133 Res. │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │Saxon Res.

Detraining on August 12–13, 1914, northeast of Trèves, (Coblentz-\r\nTrèves railroad), entering Belgium by way of Viel-Salm on the 19th, it\r\nadvanced into France by way of the Ardennes and Champagne and from there\r\nto Sompuis (west of Vitry le François, Sept. 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n3. Going into action on September 8 and 9 in the vicinity of Mailly, it\r\nretired by way of Mourmelon and Sept-Saulx to the east of Rheims\r\n(Moronvilliers-Vaudesincourt). It made a stand in this sector and\r\nestablished its position there (end of September).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1.

In April, 1915, the 106th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 123d Division, a new\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September, 1915, it suffered very heavy losses while\r\nopposing the French offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved from its sector in Champagne about the beginning of July,\r\n1916, the 24th Reserve Division was transferred to the Somme. It went\r\ninto action between Longueval and Hardecourt, from the middle to the end\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n2. Some elements of the division were still fighting on the Somme (near\r\nMartinpuich in September).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. About September 21, the 24th Reserve Division was put in line north\r\nof Arras (area from Lievin to Roclincourt).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. It left Artois in the middle of November to return to the Somme,\r\nsouth of Bapaume (Le Transloy-Gueudecourt). It remained there until\r\nDecember 12, then returned to Artois (sector east of Arras) at the end\r\nof December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The 24th Reserve Division occupied the sector east of Arras until\r\nMarch 25, 1917. Relieved at this date, it was sent to rest northeast of\r\nGhent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. On April 26 it entrained for the Eastern Front. Itinerary: Herbestal-\r\nAix la Chapelle-Dusseldorf-Barmen-Leipzig-Dresden-Georlitz-Lemberg.\r\nDetraining in Galicia, it went into line south of Brzezany, at the\r\nbeginning of May. It underwent the Russian offensive at the beginning of\r\nJuly, in the course of which prisoners of the three regiments and a part\r\nof the artillery of the division were left in the hands of the Russians\r\n(366 prisoners from the 133d Reserve Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the front and reorganized, the 24th Reserve Division\r\nagain went into action on July 20 (German counterattack). It advanced as\r\nfar as Zbrucz and suffered new losses.\r\n\r\n4. About August 16 it took over the sector of Skala.\r\n\r\n5. Entraining for the Western Front on October 24, it detrained at\r\nBruges on the 31st. Itinerary: Stanislau-Lemberg-Breslau-Dresden-\r\nLeipzig-Cassel-Trèves—Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. After a rest in Belgium during the month of November, the 24th\r\nReserve Division fought at Cambrai (end of November). It remained in the\r\nsector Flesquieres-Graincourt until the end of February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 24th Reserve Division took part in numerous battles; it is a fairly\r\ngood division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Cambrai sector on February 6 by the\r\n27th Division and went to rest in the Ivny area. On the 28th it marched\r\nvia Cambrai-Sains Inchy to Prouville and went into line.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It took part in the initial attack and by the 22d had reached\r\nBoursies. On the following day, the division advanced through Hermies to\r\nRuyaulcourt and was relieved in the evening. The division rested until\r\nApril 6 when it came into line north of Hangard where it was engaged\r\nuntil April 19, when the 19th Division relieved it. The division\r\nsuffered very heavily from artillery and machine gun fire in this\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n3. The division was at rest until May 1, when it returned to the front\r\nsouth of the Somme, relieving the 1st Division. About the 24th of May\r\nthe division sideslipped north and took the sector astride the Somme. It\r\nwas relieved about the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested in the Cambrai area undergoing training. It left\r\nCambrai about July 19 and was engaged west of Fere en Tardenois on July\r\n24. The division took part in the fighting on the Aisne until about\r\nSeptember 5. It passed to second line for about two weeks and returned\r\nto line at Pinon on September 20. Until the armistice, it was constantly\r\nengaged in resisting the Allied advance. It was identified at Verneuil\r\n(Oct. 19), Chalaudry (21st), Mortiers (26th), Crecy (28th), and south of\r\nLandouzy on November 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was used as an attack division\r\nin March, but thereafter was engaged entirely on the defensive. It\r\nappears to have resisted as well as the average German division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        24th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │         1918[16]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │9 Landwehr.  │24 Landwehr. │             │24 Landwehr.\r\n              │             │48 Landwehr. │             │48 Landwehr.\r\n              │             │427.         │             │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Artillery.   │Art.

The 24th Landwehr Division was formed on the Eastern Front about\r\nOctober, 1917, by the transformation of the 9th Landwehr Brigade (24th\r\nand 48th Landwehr Regiments).\r\n\r\nThis brigade, after forming a part of the war garrison of Koenigsberg\r\n(August, 1914), then of the Sommer Division, had gone over to the new\r\n10th Landwehr Division in 1915.\r\n\r\nBecoming independent, it held the sector of Lake Svir until September,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIAGLA.\r\n\r\n2. Made up of the 24th and 48th Landwehr Regiments, to which was\r\ntemporarily joined the 427th Infantry Regiment coming from the 205th\r\nDivision, the 24th Landwehr Division occupied the sector south of Lake\r\nNarotch-Spiagla until February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 24th Landwehr Division is of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1918, the division was reduced to two regiments, the\r\n427th Regiment having been sent to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVONIA.\r\n\r\n2. In March the division advanced into Russia and was identified about\r\nthe middle of May in the Ostrov-Reijitsa region. The 427th Regiment was\r\ndissolved, but the 48th Landwehr Regiment was identified in Russia on\r\nthe 19th of September. It seems possible that the divisional staff was\r\nalso disbanded and that the 9th Landwehr Brigade, with the 48th Landwehr\r\nRegiment under its orders, again became independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             25th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │49.      │115 Body │49.      │115 Body │49.      │115 Body\r\n              │         │  Gd.    │         │  Gd.    │         │  Gd.\r\n              │         │  Inf.   │         │  Inf.   │         │  Inf.\r\n              │         │116.     │         │116.     │         │116.\r\n              │50.      │117 Body │50.      │117 Body │         │117 Body\r\n              │         │  Inf.   │         │  Inf.   │         │  Inf.\r\n              │         │118.     │         │118.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │6 Dragoon Rgt.     │                   │6 Dragoon Rgt.

The 25th Division, also known as the Hessian Grand Ducal Division,\r\nformed, in August, 1914, with the 21st Division, the 18th Army Corps. On\r\nAugust 3 its 50th Brigade set out for Koenigsmacher, near Thionville, as\r\ncovering troops. On August 10 and 11 the 25th Division entered the Grand\r\nDuchy of Luxemburg, which it crossed, and entered Belgian Luxemburg on\r\nthe 19th.\r\n\r\n\r\nARDENNES.\r\n\r\n2. It formed a part of the 4th Army (Duke of Wurttemberg) and fought at\r\nMaissin, northwest of Neufchateau on August 22. On August 24, it entered\r\nFrance; on the 27th it crossed the Meuse below Mouzon. (On Aug. 31 the\r\nlosses had been such that the remnants of the 116th Infantry Regiment\r\nformed only four companies.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n3. On September 6 and the days immediately following the 25th Division\r\ntook part in the battle of the Marne between Vitry and Sermaize. In the\r\nmiddle of the month, it was northwest of Rheims, on the Aisne-Marne\r\nCanal. On September 26 it entrained at Laon for Ham.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. In October the 18th Army Corps was reattached to the 2d Army which\r\nformed at this time the extreme right flank of the German Army (Péronne\r\narea) and the division went into line—the Lihons-Chaulnes road to the\r\nbanks of the Avre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. The 25th Division was retained in this sector north of the Avre until\r\nOctober 15, 1915. During this time it did not take part in any important\r\naction. In March it ceded the 118th Infantry Regiment to the 56th\r\nDivision, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. After a long rest in the St. Quentin area (the staff of the 18th Army\r\nCorps was at Fresnoy le Grand in December, 1915, and that of the 25th\r\nDivision at Busigny in January, 1916) the 25th Division was transferred\r\nto the sector north of Verdun at the beginning of February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. On February 21, 1916, it took part in the general attack north of\r\nVerdun. After advancing rapidly, the 18th Army Corps was stopped in the\r\narea west of Douaumont. On March 9 it failed in its attacks on the\r\nHaudremont Farm.\r\n\r\n2. The Army Corps was then sent to rest in the rear area to be\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\n3. About April 10, the 18th Army Corps reappeared in line (Caillette\r\nwood). The 25th Division suffered very heavy losses in its attacks.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved about April 25, it was put in line about the middle of May\r\nin the vicinity of Craonne.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. It was withdrawn from this sector about the 1st of September and\r\ntransferred to the Somme, where it went into action from September 15 to\r\nOctober 1, and again lost very heavily.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of October the 25th Division left the Somme to\r\noccupy the sector Apremont-Ailly wood in the Woevre.\r\n\r\n7. Again transferred to the Somme at the end of November, it was put\r\ninto line in the area north of Chaulnes (sector from Kratz wood to the\r\nDemi-Lune). It was in this sector at the time of the retirement on March\r\n16, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. On this date it carried out its retreat by way of Villecourt-Matigny-\r\nDouchy-Roupy, in the direction of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n2. On March 20 it began to withstand our advance on the line. Savy-\r\nDallon-Giffecourt, and when the front was stabilized on April 4 it\r\noccupied the sector in front of St. Quentin and did not leave until the\r\nend of May, after having pillaged the town.\r\n\r\n3. It spent the month of June at rest (area of Neuvillette-Bernot).\r\n\r\n4. On July 2 it went into line (Itancourt sector), and on July 18\r\nlaunched an attack upon the salient Moulin de Tous Vents (south of St.\r\nQuentin).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved about the middle of September, it was sent to the active\r\nsector of Flanders (north of Zandvoorde).\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of October it was sent to rest in the Ghent area.\r\n\r\n7. It reappeared on the front, near Passchendaele, in the middle of\r\nNovember, and remained there except for a few short intervals until its\r\nrelief on February 10, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 25th Division is recruited from the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Men are\r\nfurnished principally from the rest of the 18th Corps District and the\r\nRhine District (7th and 8th Corps Districts).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Army Corps has been considered one of the best corps in the\r\nGerman Army.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1917, the morale of the 25th Division appeared good. At\r\nthis time, as the division had not taken part in any important actions\r\nsince September, 1916, it was difficult to form a judgment as to the\r\ncombat value of this organization.\r\n\r\nIts local operation on the salient of Moulin de Tous Vents (July 18,\r\n1917) was carried out energetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The reports concerning the location of the 25th Division during\r\nJanuary and early February are conflicting, mention being made in some\r\nof two reliefs; it seems most likely, however, that the division was not\r\nrelieved until February 10, when the 15th Division took over its sector\r\neast of Passchendaele.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONS.\r\n\r\n2. On the 15th it entrained at Iseghem and traveled via Courtrai-Ath-\r\nMons to Givry; from here it marched to Bavai (southwest of Mons), where\r\nit underwent a course of intensive training in open warfare; cooperation\r\nwith tanks was featured.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n3. The division marched from Pommereuil on the 16th, via Le Cateau and\r\nBusigny, to Becquigny, and from there, on the 19th, to Wiancourt,\r\nreenforcing the battle front near Le Verguier (northwest of St. Quentin)\r\non the 21st. It was relieved about the 30th, after having suffered heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMIENS.\r\n\r\n4. On April 1 it went back into line southeast of Hangard en Santerre\r\n(southeast of Amiens); it was withdrawn about the 12th and moved by easy\r\nstages to the Lille area, where, on account of its good fighting on the\r\nSt. Quentin and Amiens fronts, it was inspected by the Kaiser on April\r\n20. The commander of the 115th Regiment received Pour le Mérite at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETHUNE.\r\n\r\n5. During the night of the 26–27th of April it relieved the 240th\r\nDivision near Hinges (north of Bethune); relieved by the 36th Reserve\r\nDivision on the 10th of May, it went to rest in the area north of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYS.\r\n\r\n6. On July 4 the division moved up into close reserve in the Laventie-\r\nEstaires area, and during the night of the 6–7th it relieved the 16th\r\nDivision near Merville, north of the Lys. On the 20th it was withdrawn,\r\nthe 16th Division coming back into line, and went to the Lille area.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. After about a month’s rest it reenforced the front near Montauban\r\n(southeast of Albert). The front was being forced back here, and so the\r\ndivision passed successively through Hardecourt, Combles, and the St.\r\nPierre-Vaast wood, where it was withdrawn September 5, after losing\r\nabout 900 prisoners, and went to rest in the Bohain-Malincourt area.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n8. The division reenforced the front near Briastre (east of Cambrai) on\r\nOctober 11, and was withdrawn about the 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIENNES.\r\n\r\n9. On November 1 it came back into line north of Valenciennes, and had\r\nnot been withdrawn on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 25th is rated as a first-class division. It did very well in the\r\nlarge amount of heavy fighting in which it participated during 1918, and\r\nas a result suffered exceedingly heavy losses, especially in officers.\r\nIt received numerous large drafts, and so the division’s strength was\r\nrather larger than the average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         25th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │116 Res. │49  Res. │116 Res. │50 Res.  │83 Res.\r\n              │         │118 Res. │         │118 Res. │         │118 Res.\r\n              │         │83 Res.  │50 Res.  │83 Res.  │         │168.\r\n              │         │168.     │         │168.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Res.

At the outbreak of the war the 25th Reserve Division, forming with\r\nthe 21st Reserve Division the 18th Reserve Corps, belonged to the 4th\r\nArmy (Duke of Wurttemberg).\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n2. It detrained August 9–11 at Hermeskeil (southeast of Treves); entered\r\nLuxemburg the 16th (by way of Remich); crossed Luxemburg on the 19th;\r\nentered Belgium on the 20th. On the 22d it fought at Neufchateau; on the\r\n22d, at Tremblois; crossed the Meuse on the 28th. To the west of the\r\nArgonne the 25th Reserve Division advanced to the area of Revigny. At\r\nthe battle of the Marne it fought on the Saulx, in the neighborhood of\r\nBrabant le Roy (Sept. 7–10). It retired by way of Ste. Menehould,\r\nMoinemout, to the south of Cernay en Dormois (Sept. 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. In October the 25th Reserve Division was sent to Flanders, south of\r\nthe Lys. Toward the end of November it occupied a sector north of\r\nWytschaete.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. In December the division was transferred to the Eastern Front. It\r\ntook part, with the Fabeck Corps, in the operations on the Bzura\r\n(December, 1914, to February, 1915).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of February, 1915, it was engaged in the Carpathians north\r\nof the Dniester (Von der Marwitz Detachment); in June at Przemysl, then\r\nat Lemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREST-LITOWSK.\r\n\r\n2. In July, the 25th Reserve Division took part in the offensive on\r\nBrest-Litowsk. Its successes occasioned it heavy losses; the 5th Company\r\nof the 168th Infantry Regiment received not less than 199 men as\r\nreplacements from June 19 to August 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n3. The division took part in the Serbian campaign (October-November).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. It was transferred to the Western Front at the beginning of December,\r\n1917. It entrained at Weisskirchen (Hungary). Itinerary: Temesvar-\r\nBudapest-Vienna-Ulm-Stuttgart-Spire-Deux Ponts-Saarbrucken-Sedan\r\n(detrained on Dec. 11).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n5. On December 18, the 25th Reserve Division went into line on the\r\nArgonne (La Harazee).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Argonne until the end of July, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July it was transferred to the Verdun area. It\r\nwas engaged in the sector of Thiaumont (July-August); in the Nawe wood\r\n(August) and suffered heavy losses. It was again very much exhausted\r\nresisting the French attack of October 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved after this attack, the 25th Reserve Division was sent to\r\nrest in vicinity of Jametz and was reorganized. On November 16 it went\r\ninto line east of Auberive. In the course of November it received\r\nimportant replacements, including a large proportion of the 1917 class.\r\nIts reconstitution was not completed until February; 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division was retained on the Champagne front (Auberive) until the\r\nend of January, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. On February 27 it went into line on the right bank of the Meuse\r\n(sector of Louvemont-Chambrettes-Caurieres wood) and remained there,\r\nwithout any important losses, until June 20.\r\n\r\n3. After resting until July 6 in the vicinity of Juvigny, Jametz,\r\nMarville, the 25th Reserve Division again occupied the front near Verdun\r\n(north of Vacherauville). North of Louvemont it withstood the French\r\nattack of August 20, which caused it to suffer very heavy losses (47\r\nofficers and 1,150 men prisoners, of whom 1,012 belonged to 168th\r\nInfantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\nVOSGES.\r\n\r\n4. The 25th Reserve Division, already weakened by an epidemic of\r\ndysentery, was almost completely exhausted, when it was relieved on\r\nAugust 25 on the Verdun front. Sent to rest in the vicinity of\r\nSarreburg, it took over a sector of the Vosges (Blamont), about\r\nSeptember 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved on September 25 and entraining on the 27th at Rechicourt,\r\nthe division was transferred to Champagne, where it occupied the sector\r\nNogent-l’Abbesse (Nov. 11 to beginning of February, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 25th Reserve Division is recruited from the Grand Duchy of Hesse,\r\nthe Electorate of Hesse, and Hesse-Nassau. At times replacements were\r\nfurnished from the Rhine districts, including the Grand Duchy of Baden\r\n(especially in 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 25th Reserve Division put up a splendid defense against the French\r\nat the time of the attack on August 20, 1917.\r\n\r\nIt was an excellent organization at the outbreak of the campaign, but it\r\nseems (in spite of recent assertions of prisoners that it is still unfit\r\nto attack and was put in the fourth class, Arbeits Division) that the\r\n25th Reserve Division, although it is exhausted by too long stays in\r\nline, is capable of rendering services even on an active front.\r\nTherefore it must be considered as a good division of the second class\r\nuntil more detailed information is received (Mar. 30, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 25th Reserve Division was relieved by the 21st Division in the\r\nNogent-l’Abbesse sector on February 6, and went to the Vouziers area,\r\nwhere it was put through a course of training, but not in open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. On the 20th it relieved the 10th Reserve Division near Juvincourt\r\n(northwest of Rheims); it was withdrawn on April 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n3. The division moved north by easy stages, and relieved the 6th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division, west of Montdidier, on the 21st. Here it lost\r\nnear Cantigny (north) heavily while trying to prevent Cantigny from\r\nfalling to the Americans. It also lost even more heavily during the\r\noffensive of August 9, and was pushed back to Dancourt (southwest of\r\nRoye). It was withdrawn about the 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n4. On September 1 it reenforced the front near Voyennes (west of St.\r\nQuentin). In the fighting that followed the division was forced back to\r\nthe Holnon wood (west of St. Quentin); it was withdrawn here about the\r\n20th.\r\n\r\n5. On the 30th, it again reenforced the front in the Lehaucourt sector\r\n(north of St. Quentin). It was withdrawn on October 11, and dissolved.\r\n168th Regiment was transferred to the 21st Reserve Division. 83d Reserve\r\nRegiment was disbanded and drafted to the 22d Division. 87th Reserve\r\nRegiment was disbanded and drafted to the 48th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nUntil 1918 the 25th Reserve had been considered a second-class division.\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that although it was trained in February,\r\nthe training it received was not in open warfare—not to fit it to become\r\nan attack division. Prisoners captured soon after stated that the\r\nGermans considered it as little better than “a labor division.” It was\r\nnot used in any of the offensives made by the Germans, and was not very\r\ntenacious on the defense in any sector that was at all active. Moreover,\r\ntwo of the divisions that received replacements from the division when\r\nit was disbanded were second class and the other was rated as a fourth-\r\nclass division. It was probably a third-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        25th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │25 Mixed │13 Ldw.  │32 Res.  │13 Ldw.  │32 Res.  │13 Ldw.\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │16 Ldw.  │         │16 Ldw.  │         │16 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │328 Ldw. │         │328 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Sqn. 6 Res.

The 25th Landwehr Division was organized in part from the former 25th\r\nMixed Landwehr Brigade, independent (13th and 16th Landwehr Regiments),\r\nwhich entered Belgium on August 20, 1914, and went immediately after the\r\nbattle of the Marne to the Laon area, where it occupied the Craonne-La\r\nVille aux Bois sector from the end of September, 1914, until almost the\r\nend of 1916.\r\n\r\n2. In October, 1916, the 25th Landwehr Brigade was transformed into the\r\n25th Landwehr Division by the addition of a third regiment, the Schuster\r\nRegiment, which had existed for only a short time.\r\n\r\n3. The division was then sent to the west and sent into line between\r\nVailly and Chavonne (October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1917, the 186th Infantry Regiment was\r\nadded as a third regiment to the 25th Landwehr Division. The division\r\nwas still occupying the sector east of Vailly when the French offensive\r\nwas launched on April 16. The division suffered heavy losses, retiring\r\nto the Chemin des Dames by way of Ostel, Aizy, Jouy (Apr. 16–22).\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER ALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved north of the Aisne about April 25, the 25th Landwehr\r\nDivision was transferred to Upper Alsace. At the beginning of May it\r\nwent into line near the Swiss frontier (Hirtzbach, Largitzen, Bisel). It\r\ndid not leave this sector since that time.\r\n\r\n3. In May the 186th Infantry Regiment was replaced by a new regiment,\r\nthe 328th Landwehr Regiment, formed by taking one battalion of each of\r\nthe three regiments of the 13th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division has a marked sectional quality; the infantry and field\r\nartillery come entirely from Westphalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThis is purely a sector division. The 25th Landwehr Division has been in\r\nline near the Swiss frontier for more than a year.\r\n\r\nSince its arrival in Upper Alsace (May, 1917) the division has possessed\r\nan assault detachment supposed to carry out raids (June, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the Hirzbach-Swiss frontier sector all\r\nthrough the year until the signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 25th Landwehr Division is rated as a fourth-class division, as being\r\nfit to hold only a quiet sector. On the 11th of November, soon after the\r\nhour fixed for the suspension of hostilities, a number of men came over\r\nto the French lines to fraternize; they were taken prisoners. It seems\r\nthat there had been a great deal of revolutionary agitation in the\r\ndivision. On October 8 a doctor had had his epaulettes cut to pieces; on\r\nthe 9th the Soldiers’ Council had come together and had elected\r\nrepresentatives; on the 10th the company commander (of at least one\r\ncompany) had read the program for the organization of the Soldiers’\r\nCouncil. Prisoners state that the causes of this state of mind were the\r\nrecent defeats suffered by the German forces, the weariness caused by\r\nfour years of war, and the Kiel disturbances. From the 10th of November\r\non none of the advanced posts had been occupied, and the men refused to\r\ndo any work, the war having come to an end, to their mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             26th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │51.      │119 Gren.│51.      │119 Gren.│51.      │119 Gren.\r\n              │         │125.     │         │125.     │         │121.\r\n              │52.      │121.     │52.      │121.     │         │125.\r\n              │         │122 Fus. │         │122 Fus. │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │20 Uhlan Rgt.      │20 Uhlan Rgt.      │20 Uhlan Rgt.

At the outbreak of the war the 26th Division formed the 13th Army\r\nCorps, with the 27th Division, and was a part of the 5th Army (German\r\nCrown Prince), and went into action on August 22 at Baranzy, northwest\r\nof Longwy, and on August 24 near Longuyon. On August 31 it crossed the\r\nMeuse in the vicinity of Sassey, proceeded between the Meuse and the\r\nArgonne by way of Epinonville, Cheppy, Clermont, and Thiaucourt, fought\r\non September 6, 7, 8, and 9 near Pretz and Beauzée, and retired toward\r\nEvre, Wally, and the Argonne (Apremont-Grurie wood). (On Sept. 11 the\r\n8th Company of the 119th Grenadier Regiment had already had 3 officers\r\nand 168 men as casualties; the 10th Company was reduced to 2 officers\r\nand 59 men.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. Separated then from the 27th Division, which remained in the Argonne,\r\nthe 26th Division was transferred west of Lille on October 8, and fought\r\nat Fromelles, Aubert, and Maisnil from October 20 to 28.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of the month it went north and took part in the attacks\r\nupon Messines on October 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of November the division entrained for Russia with the\r\n25th Reserve Division, these two divisions forming the reorganized 13th\r\nArmy Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n5. In December and January, 1915, it was a part of the Fabeck Corps, and\r\nfought in Poland on the Bzura and the Rawka where it suffered heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1915, the 26th Division was sent to the front north of\r\nPrasnysz. It then composed the 13th Army Corps, with the 4th Guard\r\nDivision and the 3d Division. In May it gave the 122d Fusilier Regiment\r\nto the 105th Division, a new formation. In June and July it took part in\r\nthe offensive upon the Narew.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n2. Assigned to the army of Gen. von Koevess, it took part in the\r\ncampaign against Serbia (October) and advanced along the Morava to\r\nKragujevatz.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest at Belgrade, at the end of November, before its\r\ndeparture for the Western Front, it entrained at Semlin on November 26\r\nand was transferred to Belgium. (Itinerary: Budapest-Vienna-Munich-Ulm-\r\nDeux Ponts-Saarbrücken; detraining at Bertrix on Nov. 20.)\r\n\r\n4. In December it was concentrated in the vicinity of Courtrai, where\r\nthe 27th Division was and again formed the 13th Army Corps with this\r\ndivision as it had done originally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1916, the 26th Division went into line southeast of Ypres\r\n(between Hooge and the south of Sanctuary wood). It held this sector\r\nuntil the month of July and suffered heavy losses July 2 (Zillebeke).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of July the division was sent to the Somme and opposed the\r\nBritish troops on the Longueval front. It lost very heavily while\r\nresting at Guillemont. (Aug. 18–19).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved on August 25, it took over the sector of Wytschaete\r\n(September to November 11).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. About November 11 the division left Flanders and returned to the\r\nSomme. It occupied the Transloy sector from December 7 to the beginning\r\nof March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in reserve during the month of March behind the\r\nArtois front; went into action south of the Scarpe at the time of the\r\nBritish offensive. On April 25 it launched a counterattack at Monchy le\r\nPreux.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved in a fortnight and sent to rest, it went back to the same\r\nsector (south of the Scarpe); remained there from May 31 to the end of\r\nJuly without any important losses and went to rest near Cambrai during\r\nthe first half of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. From August 16 to September 4 it occupied the sector north of\r\nLangemerck, where the artillery caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to rest in Lorraine, it was trained and was outfitted for\r\nmountain warfare and then sent to the Italian front at the end of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n5. It formed a part of the Berrer Corps (14th German Army) on October\r\n20, fought northwest of Tolmino on October 24, entered Udine on the\r\n28th, and reached the Tagliamento on the 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 26th Division is recruited entirely in Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th Division conducted itself well in the numerous battles in which\r\nit took part. It is to be especially noted that at Poelcappelle, in\r\nAugust, 1917, some units mutinied and left the first line vacant, when\r\nthe relief did not arrive quickly enough. This weakening of the morale\r\nof the 26th Division was probably only temporary and will disappear, no\r\ndoubt, after a period of rest. (British Summary of Information, October,\r\n1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. The 26th Division, after having done very well in Italy, was\r\ntransported to the Western Front, detraining in the Freiburg region\r\n(southeast of Dieuze), and remaining here until March 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n2. The division entrained at Strassburg on the 11th and 12th, and\r\ndetrained near Peruwelz on the 13th and 14th, remaining in the\r\nneighborhood of Valenciennes until the 17th; from here it proceeded by\r\nnight marches via Denain and Aniche to the Estrées-Ecourt-St. Quentin\r\nregion (south of Douai), where it arrived on the 20th. On the 26th it\r\nwent into close reserve near Fontaine les Croisilles, and the next day\r\nit entered line near Hamelincourt (south of Arras). It attacked the next\r\nday, but made no headway. It was relieved by the 111th Division on the\r\n31st, and rested near Croisilles until April 3.\r\n\r\n3. Then it marched via Bapaume and Miraumont and entered line south of\r\nHébuterne (south of Arras), taking part in the unsuccessful attack of\r\nthe 5th. It was relieved about the 12th of May by the 16th Reserve\r\nDivision, and went to the Denain region to rest and refit. On June 15 it\r\nwas in army reserve in the Roye-Carrépuis area.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n4. About July 3 it went to the vicinity of Neuflize (northeast of\r\nRheims); the 15th it entered line north of Prosnes (southeast of\r\nRheims), and was withdrawn on the 17th.\r\n\r\n5. By traveling in trucks, the division reached Bazoches on the 21st; it\r\nremained in reserve the 23d and 24th, and relieved the 45th Reserve\r\nDivision east of Saponay (northwest of Fere-en-Tardenois) during the\r\nnight of July 25–26. The Allied push forced the front back here, and the\r\ndivision was identified north of Saponay on August 2, northeast of\r\nFismes on the 18th, east of Braine on the 20th. It was relieved about\r\nthe 10th of September and went to rest north of Pont Arcy (northwest of\r\nFismes).\r\n\r\n6. On the 3d of October it came back into line north of Soupir (east of\r\nVailly), and was still in line on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th is rated as a first-class division. While it was in Alsace\r\n(January, February, and the first part of March) it was thoroughly\r\ntrained in open warfare, and so it was used as a shock division, but it\r\ndid not succeed in making much headway in its first two engagements. It\r\ndid fight tenaciously, however, then and in subsequent fighting, and was\r\nmentioned in the German communiques of October 27 and November 2 as\r\nhaving particularly distinguished itself. It suffered heavy losses, so\r\nthat despite the large numbers of reenforcements sent it from time to\r\ntime, its battalions were reduced to three companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         26th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │51 Res.  │121 Res. │51 Res.  │121 Res. │51 Res.  │119 Res.\r\n              │         │180.     │         │180.     │         │180.\r\n              │         │99 Res.  │         │99 Res.  │52 Res.  │121 Res.\r\n              │52 Res.  │119 Res. │52 Res.  │119 Res. │         │99 Res.\r\n              │         │120 Res. │         │120 Res. │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │Wurtt.

At the beginning of the war the 26th Reserve Division, forming the\r\n14th Reserve Corps with the 28th Reserve Division, was a part of the 7th\r\nGerman Army. While the 99th Reserve Infantry Regiment formed in Alsace\r\nand at once went to the valley of the Bruche, the 180th Infantry\r\nRegiment went to Ste. Marie aux Mines on August 8. The three reserve\r\nregiments (119th, 120th, 121st) detrained between Freiburg and Neu-\r\nBreisach on August 8–11 and fought at the Donon and in the valley of the\r\nBruche from August 17 to 24. Going then to the western slope of the\r\nVosges, the division reached St. Die on August 28, then advanced as far\r\nas Rougiville, from which place it was sent to Ste. Marie aux Mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. On September 11 the 26th Reserve Division was sent to the Somme and\r\nassigned to the 2d Army. It went into action on both banks of the Ancre,\r\nnear Thiepval, near Miraumont and Beaumont Hamel, beginning on the 27th.\r\n\r\n3. It occupied this sector of the front (south of Hebuterne, north of\r\nOvillers) until July, 1916. During this period it did not take part in\r\nany important action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1915, the 120th Reserve Infantry Regiment was given to the\r\n58th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. In May, 1915, elements of the 26th Reserve Division were sent to\r\nArtois on detached service and fought at Neuville-St. Vaast. In June\r\nsome units of the 99th Reserve Regiment (3d and 4th Battalions) and the\r\n180th Infantry Regiment took part in the battles around Arras (Le\r\nLabyrinthe).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of July these elements rejoined the division, which\r\ncontinued to hold the Somme sector before Bapaume.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. On July 1, 1916, the 26th Reserve Division withstood the Franco-\r\nBritish offensive north and south of the Ancre (Beaumont Hamel,\r\nOvillers, Thiepval). (The total of the losses on the Somme amounted to\r\n10,042 men.) The 99th Reserve Infantry Regiment lost 48 officers and\r\n2,070 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved along the Somme about October 6, the division was sent south\r\nof Arras (Monchy aux Bois) on October 10. Some elements of the division\r\nwere still engaged on both banks of the Ancre in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n1. After having occupied the calm sector of Artois for the winter of\r\n1916–17, the 26th Reserve Division took part in the withdrawal of the\r\nGerman troops about March 20. It left the front of Monchy aux Bois and\r\nretired southeast of Croisilles (Lagnicourt-Ecoust-St. Main). It fought\r\nalong this line until April 7–13 and suffered some losses (Noreuil, Apr.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n2. After a rest of a month in the vicinity of Valenciennes, in the\r\ncourse of which it sent some elements south of St. Quentin (Itancourt,\r\nMay 4–11), the 26th Reserve Division went back into line between Arras\r\nand St. Quentin (Bullecourt-Queant) about May 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. On August 10 the division was withdrawn from the front and entrained\r\nat Aubigny au Bac (south of Douai) for Belgium. It went into action\r\nnorth of Langemarck (Aug. 19-Sept. 16). It was then sent to rest\r\n(vicinity of Bohain, northeast of St. Quentin) until October 14.\r\n\r\n4. About October 17 the 26th Reserve Division went back into line north\r\nof Ypres (The Ypres-Staden railroad—Houthulst wood) until October 23.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to rest south of Cortemarck, it was transferred at the end of\r\nOctober to Eerneghem, where it was first in reserve.\r\n\r\n6. In the middle of November the 26th Reserve Division took over the\r\ncalm sector of Merckem, which it occupied until February, 1918, after a\r\nshort rest in the middle of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSince the departure of the 99th Reserve Infantry Regiment, the 26th\r\nReserve Division is made up entirely of Wurttembergers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th Reserve Division is a very good division, of a combative value\r\nequal to that of the majority of the active divisions. In the battle of\r\nthe Somme, in 1916, it opposed a stubborn resistance to the British\r\nadvance and launched vigorous counterattacks.\r\n\r\nThe division has not been seriously engaged since 1916; it was\r\nthoroughly rested on the Flanders front. Not having been exposed to\r\nviolent battles and not having any great losses, its morale has not been\r\nshaken. (British Summary of Information, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. The 26th Reserve Division was withdrawn from the Merckem sector on\r\nthe 20th of February, and went to the area west of Antwerp. Here, it was\r\nvery probably trained in open warfare, but the fact has not been\r\ndefinitely established.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n2. It left about March 11 and entered line near Hénin (southeast of\r\nArras) on the 24th. Its mission was to protect the troops engaged in the\r\nmain attack farther to the south against a flanking movement by the\r\nBritish troops massed around Arras. In so doing, it became heavily\r\nengaged, and is reported to have lost 60 per cent of its strength. It\r\nwas relieved on May 14, and went to rest in the Arleux area (south of\r\nDouai).\r\n\r\n3. On June 9 it relieved the 41st Division east of Hebuterne. A week or\r\nso later it extended its sector toward the south so as to relieve the\r\n16th Reserve Division. It was relieved about July 23 by the 183d\r\nDivision, and went to rest in the Bapaume area, after having suffered\r\nsevere losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On August 10 the division reenforced the front astride the Braye-\r\nCorbie road (north of the Somme). It did not become heavily engaged this\r\ntime; withdrawn about the 18th, and went to rest in the Douai area.\r\nBattalions were reduced to three companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n5. It reenforced the front near Vis en Artois (on Arras-Cambrai road) on\r\nAugust 27. After suffering heavy losses it was withdrawn on the 31st to\r\nregion north of Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. It came back into line on the 29th of September, after having rested\r\nand thoroughly refitted, reenforcing the front near Tilloy (northwest of\r\nCambrai). It was heavily engaged, and fought very well. A few days later\r\nGen. von Beulow (commanding the 17th Army) sent a telegram to the King\r\nof Saxony saying that the division had fought in an exemplary manner at\r\nCambrai, where it had several times reestablished the situation by its\r\ncounterattacks on the 29th, inflicting enormous losses on the enemy, and\r\nthus preventing the town from falling into their hands. It was withdrawn\r\nabout the 9th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIENNES.\r\n\r\n7. On the 13th it relieved the 22d Division near Herin (west of\r\nValenciennes). It had not been withdrawn on the 11th of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th Reserve is rated as a first-class division. It did not\r\ndistinguish itself in the fighting during 1918 (except on the Cambrai\r\nfront, as already noted), still it could be depended upon and on the\r\nwhole fought well. In this connection it is to be noted that the 26th\r\nDivision had been held in reserve to relieve the 26th Reserve in the\r\nMarch offensive, but the relief was considered unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        26th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │51 Ldw.      │119 Ldw.     │51 Ldw.      │119 Ldw.\r\n              │             │123 Ldw.     │             │123 Ldw.\r\n              │             │124 Ldw.     │             │124 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Sqn. 20 Uhlan Rgt.       │3 Sqn. 20 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │Art.

The 26th Landwehr Division was formed on the Alsatian front at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1917. Two of its regiments, the 119th and 123d\r\nLandwehr, forming the 51st Landwehr Brigade, had belonged to the 7th\r\nLandwehr Division until that time. Its 3d Regiment, the 124th Landwehr,\r\ncame from the 2d Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER ALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. Since its formation the 26th Landwehr Division has continually\r\noccupied the Upper Alsace front (north of Cernay, Hartmannswillerskopf).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division is entirely recruited from Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th Landwehr Division is purely a sector division.

At the beginning of the war it formed a part of the 5th Army (German\r\nCrown Prince). It was engaged in the battle of Longwy, August 22, 1914\r\n(between Longwy and Virton); on the 23d, north of Longuyon. On August\r\n30, at Dun and Sassey, it crossed the Meuse and went south with the 5th\r\nArmy between the Meuse and the Argonne. It fought at Pretz and\r\nVaubécourt on September 6 and 7. Following the retirement to the north,\r\nit took up its positions in the Argonne.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of October the 13th Army Corps was broken up and the\r\ntwo divisions were separated for more than a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. The 27th Division remained in the Argonne until the end of 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. In the Argonne (Binarville-Grurie wood) the 27th Division was engaged\r\nin mine warfare. In August, 1915, it took part in the local offensive of\r\nthe Army of the Crown Prince.\r\n\r\n2. In September, at the time of the French offensive, elements of the\r\n53d Brigade were sent to Champagne (northwest of Massiges), where they\r\nremained in reserve.\r\n\r\n3. In December the 27th Division entrained at Grandpré for the Courtrai\r\narea, where the 13th Army Corps was re-formed as in the beginning, the\r\n26th Division having returned from Serbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. From January to July, 1916, the 13th Army Corps was in line southeast\r\nof the Ypres salient. The 27th Division was on the left of the 26th,\r\nbetween Sanctuary wood and the Ypres-Comines Canal. On February 24 units\r\nof the 27th Division gained possession of the British trenches of Bluff\r\n(north of the canal), but lost them on March 2. In this action the 123d\r\nGrenadier Regiment lost very heavily.\r\n\r\nOn June 2 the two divisions of the corps made a violent attack upon the\r\nCanadians in the Cillebeke sector. They gained possession of Observation\r\nRidge, but were forced to abandon it by a counterattack. In these\r\nbattles the regiments lost heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of July the 13th Army Corps was withdrawn from the Ypres\r\nsalient and transferred to the Somme front. On August 1 the 27th\r\nDivision went into line in the Guillemont sector. It put up a successful\r\nresistance to the attacks upon the village, but had serious losses.\r\n\r\n3. It was relieved on August 25 and put in the Wytchaete sector, where\r\nit remained for about two and one-half months (until Nov. 11).\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of November the 27th Division returned to the Somme a\r\nsecond time, north of Sailly Saillisel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 27th Division was retained on the Somme until the beginning of\r\n1917. On this date it was sent east of Cambrai. During the month of\r\nMarch it was in line in the Roisel area.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. After a short rest in the vicinity of Valenciennes it went into\r\naction in the Bullecourt sector (southeast of Arras), where it had very\r\nheavy losses (Apr. 7 to May 11). The dissolution of the 627th Infantry\r\nRegiment, formed in Wurttemberg, served to make up a part of its losses,\r\nand 600 men from this regiment came to the 27th Division.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn about May 11 from the Arras front, the 27th Division\r\noccupied a sector in the vicinity of Le Catelet (between Gonnelieu and\r\nHonnecourt) at the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of August it was relieved; entrained on August 12 at\r\nCaudry, and was transferred to Flanders by way of Lille-Tourcoing-Menin-\r\nLedeghem-Roulers.\r\n\r\n5. On August 26 it went into action northeast of Ypres (southeast of St.\r\nJulien). In this sector it did not take part in any important attack but\r\nsuffered heavily from artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe division was sent to the rear on September 12–13 and rested for a\r\nmonth northeast of Ghent.\r\n\r\nOn October 11 it went back into line northeast of Ypres (near the Ypres-\r\nThourout railroad) and remained there until November 11. It was sent\r\nalmost immediately to Alsace, where it arrived between November 16 and\r\n18.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 27th Division is recruited entirely from Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 27th Division has fought well ever since the beginning of the war.\r\nIt seems that the heavy losses which it has suffered have weakened its\r\nmorale to a slight extent. Nevertheless, it may be considered as a very\r\ngood division (Dec. 9, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The 27th Division remained in the region of Schlettstadt (north of\r\nColmar) until February 2. While here it received some 1919-class\r\nrecruits. It then went to Cambrai, where it arrived on the 4th. On the\r\n6th it relieved the 24th Reserve Division west of Graincourt (southwest\r\nof Cambrai). It was relieved by the 53d Reserve Division early in March\r\nand went to the neighborhood of Avesnes le Sec (southwest of\r\nValenciennes), where it was trained in open warfare.\r\n\r\n2. Subsequently it was transferred to the Cambrai region. Between the\r\nevening of March 20 and 5 a. m. on the 21st, it marched nearly 20 miles,\r\nwhen it came into line near Villers-Guislain (south of Cambrai). It was\r\nimmediately heavily engaged and suffered severe losses. The 6th Company\r\nof the 124th Regiment had lost 84 men by the time it had reached Fins. A\r\ndraft of 30 men was received at Guinchy. Withdrawn the 23d.\r\n\r\n3. On April 4 it relieved the 54th Reserve Division near Aveluy (north\r\nof Albert). Fighting on the 5th, the 6th Company of the 124th Regiment\r\nlost 50 per cent of its effectives. All three regiments suffered heavy\r\nlosses. One battalion of the 120th Regiment was practically annihilated.\r\nIt was relieved by the 3d Naval Division on the 24th and went to rest\r\nsouth of Tournai.\r\n\r\n4. The division left on July 24 and marched via Landas-Marchiennes-\r\nNeuville sur l’Escaut (south of Denain, rest)-St. Vaast (east of\r\nCambrai, rest)-Fins-Nurlu (rest)-Peronne, into line in the Morlancourt\r\nsector (south of Albert), where it relieved the 107th Division about the\r\n3d of August. In the heavy fighting that ensued it was forced back\r\nthrough Bray and Suzanne. It was withdrawn the 28th after leaving more\r\nthan 1,400 prisoners in the hands of the British. It went to rest in the\r\nvicinity of Briastre (south of Solesmes), and while here received as a\r\ndraft the dissolved 248th Reserve Regiment (54th Division disbanded).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. The division now became army and corps reserve. On September 6 it\r\nentrained and traveled to Spincourt, arriving on the 10th. It then\r\nmarched to Camp Priester (near Loison), where it remained 14 days as\r\narmy reserve. About the 26th it entered line near Flabas (north of\r\nVerdun). Five days later it was withdrawn and went back to the camp and\r\nremained eight days.\r\n\r\n6. Then it went to the Jaeger Lager near Billy (south of Longuyon).\r\nAbout the 11th of October it entered line near Douaumont (north of\r\nVerdun). On the 29th it was relieved and marched to the Jaeger Lager,\r\nand then by truck via Stenay to a farm about 10 kilometers away.\r\n\r\n7. On November 1 it reenforced the front near Tailly (southwest of\r\nStenay); it was still in line on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 27th has always been considered one of the very best German\r\ndivisions, and its conduct in the fighting during 1918 confirms its\r\nrating as a first-class shock unit. It suffered severely, especially in\r\nthe spring, but not a great deal later on. Its moves toward the end of\r\nthe war seem to indicate that it was to form part of the reserve with\r\nwhich the Germans hoped to regain the initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             28th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │55.      │109.     │55.      │109.     │55.      │109.\r\n              │         │Body     │         │Body     │         │Body\r\n              │         │  Gren.  │         │  Gren.  │         │  Gren.\r\n              │         │110 Gren.│         │110 Gren.│         │110 Gren.\r\n              │56.      │40 Fus.  │56.      │40 Fus.  │56.      │40 Fus.\r\n              │         │111.     │         │111.     │         │111.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │5 Jag. z.

The 28th Division formed a part of the 14th Army Corps with the 29th\r\nDivision, also from Baden. At the beginning of the campaign went to\r\nUpper Alsace to reenforce the 29th Division; fought at Mulhousen on\r\nAugust 9, and on the 13th west of Altkirch. Returning to Mulhousen on\r\nthe 14th, it entrained at Muelheim on the 16th for Petite Pierre. The\r\n14th Army Corps was placed on the left flank of the 6th Army and took\r\npart with it in the battle of the 20th. The 28th Division then crossed\r\nthe frontier and advanced to Mortagne at the beginning of September. On\r\nSeptember 11 it recrossed the frontier and went to the west of Pont à\r\nMousson, where it went into action between September 20 and 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from La Haye at the end of the month, it entrained on\r\nOctober 4 at Metz, detrained at Mons, and from there marched to the\r\nfront—La Bassée, Ablain, St. Nazaire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. From October, 1914, to May, 1915, its regiments were exhausted one\r\nafter the other on the plateau of Notre Dame de Lorette. (On November\r\n30, 1914, the 110th Grenadier Regiment acknowledged casualties of 58\r\nofficers and 3,814 men since the beginning of the campaign.) The 28th\r\nDivision again suffered very heavily during the winter (especially the\r\n110th Grenadiers and the 40th Fusileers); finally it lost very heavily\r\nfrom April 9 to May 3 (Carency-Ouvrages-Blancs). In the course of these\r\nbattles the 111th Infantry Regiment was almost completely destroyed. On\r\nMay 10 its first battalion had only 3 officers and 272 men. (Notebook of\r\nthe captain commanding the battalion.) The Casualty Lists report 32\r\nofficers and 1,737 men as casualties.\r\n\r\n2. The division was relieved on May 15, sent to rest in the area Lens,\r\nPont à Vendin, Héuin-Liétard, and reorganized.\r\n\r\n3. About May 25 it was put back into line (Ablain-Lorette) and again\r\nsuffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from Artois about June 13, it was transferred to the\r\nnortheast of Reims. Beginning with June 18, it occupied the front\r\nbetween Bétheny and the Sillery-Beine road. In this sector it had only a\r\nfew local actions and very few losses.\r\n\r\n5. During the offensive of September, 1915, the division detached two\r\nbattalions (one from the 109th Grenadiers and one from the 110th\r\nGrenadiers) to act as reinforcements in the Somme Py area.\r\n\r\n6. On October 19 and 20 a gas attack was rather poorly carried out by\r\nthe Badensian Infantry (La Pompelle-Prosnes front).\r\n\r\n7. The 28th Division was relieved about November 10. At the beginning of\r\nDecember it went into the sector of Tahure-Butte du Mesnil which it\r\noccupied for the entire winter without any notable action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. About the end of April, 1916, the 28th Division left the sector of\r\nthe Butte du Mesnil. It was sent to rest for a week in the Vouziers\r\narea, and about May 5 went back into line (sector of Maisons de\r\nChampagne-La Justice). During this time the units received intensive\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. During the first half of July the regiments of the division (minus\r\nthe 109th Infantry Regiment, which had remained in Champagne) were\r\nsuccessively relieved and transferred by way of Charleville, Hirson, and\r\nSt. Quentin to the Biaches area (Somme). Between July 16 and 20 they\r\nestablished their positions between the Somme and the Barleux.\r\n\r\n3. The 28th Division was retained in this sector until the beginning of\r\nOctober. It suffered heavy losses there, which were partially covered by\r\nreenforcements sent from the depots of the 14th Army Corps (1915 and\r\n1916 classes).\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October the division was sent to Champagne, into\r\nthe sector east of Tahure. It left this about the 20th and reoccupied it\r\nfrom December until the end of January, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. At this time the 28th Division was transferred to the Verdun area. It\r\nwas sent into line in the Caurières wood sector and remained until the\r\nbeginning of September. It took part in the attacks on this front in the\r\nmiddle of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the Verdun area about the middle of September the\r\ndivision was sent to Alsace, northwest of Altkirch and was in the front\r\nline on October 20. It soon left this for the Montmedy area, then for\r\nLaon, and finally for the Cambrai front where it fought at Gonnelieu on\r\nNovember 30. Relieved at the beginning of December, it was sent to rest\r\nin the Ardennes and, at the beginning of February, 1918, occupied a\r\nsector at Mount Cornillet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 28th Division is recruited almost exclusively from Baden. A slight\r\nadmixture from the 4th Corps District. The 40th Fusileers, although a\r\nPrussian regiment, was recruited in the Grand Duchy of Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 28th Division has always given a good account of itself and must be\r\nconsidered a good division (July, 1917).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of March, 1917, it carried out an attack against the\r\nCaurières wood with a great deal of vigor. A division order (dated Mar.\r\n3, 1917) found on a corpse praises the heroism of the valiant troops of\r\nthe 28th Division and calls its regiments “The conquerors of Lorette.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Butte du Mesnil sector continuously until May\r\n13, when it rested for 10 days in the vicinity of Vouziers. On May 23\r\nthe division entrained at Montcornet and was moved to the region of\r\nLaon. It came into line on May 31, reenforcing the Aisne battle front\r\nbetween Chateau de Maucreux and Troësnes. It was relieved on June 8 by\r\nthe 10th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. Its stay out of line was short, for on June 13 it again relieved the\r\n50th Division near Verneuil; about this time the divisional commander,\r\nLieut. Gen. Hahn, was decorated. The division was withdrawn from the\r\nMarne front about July 1. It returned to reenforce the battle line near\r\nChaumuzy, southwest of Rheims on July 24. It fell back to the Vesle,\r\nwhere it held the line until August 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. The division then went to rest in the vicinity of Baroucourt for\r\nthree weeks. It left that place on September 14 and marched via\r\nAmermont-Offleville-Gondrecourt Rouvers-Etain to a position in line near\r\nGrimacourt and Hermeville, relieving the 8th Landwehr Division which\r\nside slipped to the south. It held this sector until October 19, when it\r\nwas withdrawn and moved from Conflans, via Arlon, to Flanders on October\r\n22.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONS.\r\n\r\n4. On November 1, the division came into line at Maresches in which area\r\nit fought until the armistice. The last identifications were at Sebourg\r\n(Nov. 4), west of Roisin (6th), and Dour (9th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was not greatly used in 1918,\r\nspending most of the time on quiet fronts. After the Vesle fighting in\r\nAugust, the battalions of the division were reduced to three companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         28th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │55 Res.  │109 Res. │55 Res.  │109 Res. │55 Res.  │109 Res.\r\n              │         │110 Res. │         │110 Res. │         │110 Res.\r\n              │56 Res.  │40 Res.  │56 Res.  │40 Res.  │         │111 Res.\r\n              │         │111 Res. │         │111 Res. │         │\r\n              │         │9 Res.   │         │8 Res.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Jag.   │         │  Jag.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Bn.    │         │  Bn.    │         │\r\n              │         │14 Res.  │         │14 Res.  │         │\r\n              │         │  Jag.   │         │  Jag.   │         │\r\n              │         │  Bn.    │         │  Bn.    │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │55 Ldw.  │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │  Brig.  │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │  Bn.    │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │8 Res.

At the beginning of the war the 28th Reserve Division formed in the\r\nGrand Duchy of Baden, and constituting the 14th Reserve Corps, with the\r\n26th Reserve Division, belonged to the 7th Army (Von Heeringen). The\r\ndivision detraining near Emmendingen (Baden), entered Alsace by way of\r\nMarkolsheim on August 10. It was engaged in the valley of the Bruche\r\nbeginning on the 15th, fought at Donon on the 20th, and went down toward\r\nthe Meurthe, where it fought until September 5 (Nompatelize and la\r\nBourgonce), suffering heavy losses (two-thirds of the effectives of the\r\n111th Reserve Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. After September 5 the 28th Reserve Division retired toward Blamont on\r\nSeptember 15. On September 22 and 23 it entrained at Teterchen\r\n(Lorraine) for Cambria, where it detrained on September 26 and 27. It\r\nwas assigned to the 2d Army with the other division of the 14th Reserve\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The division occupied the sector crossed by the Albert-Bapaume road\r\n(Ovillers to Fricourt) until July, 1916.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1915, the 28th Reserve Division lost the 40th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment, which went to the 115th Division, and its two battalions of\r\nChasseurs left it—one in January, the other in May.\r\n\r\n2. In August and September, 1915, elements of the division were in\r\nreserve in the area south of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. The 28th Reserve Division did not have any great losses on the Somme\r\nbetween October, 1915, and July, 1916. Its combat activity was weak\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\n2. On July 1, 1916, the Division supported the entire weight of the\r\nBritish offensive north of the Somme, and suffered very heavy losses\r\n(casualties of the 111th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 39 officers and\r\n1,821 men).\r\n\r\n3. On July 4 the division was withdrawn from the front, sent to rest,\r\nand reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. Transferred to Champagne on July 10, it took over the sector west of\r\nAuberive (July 14 to the beginning of October).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. The 28th Reserve Division was brought back to the Somme at Thiepval\r\nabout October 5; it was in action until the end of October and lost\r\nheavily. On the one day of October 24 the 9th Company of the 111th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment noted the arrival of 134 men as replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (AVOCOURT).\r\n\r\nRelieved about October 28, the division was sent to the Stenay area and\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\nBeginning of November, it occupied, at Verdun, the Avocourt sector at\r\nHill 304.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. On the Avocourt front the 28th Reserve Division took part in a few\r\nlocal engagements. It left this sector between April 7 and April 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated in the area northwest of Montfaucon, the division\r\nentrained about April 16 at Brieulles sur Meuse, Dun, Romagne and was\r\ntransferred to Rozoy sur Serre; from there it marched to the sector east\r\nof Californie Plateau (Apr. 21). It underwent the French attack of May\r\n4, which caused it heavy losses. Elements of the division lost very\r\nheavily counterattacking on the days following.\r\n\r\n3. The division was relieved on May 18 and reorganized hastily\r\n(replacements of 1,100 men including 25 per cent of the 1918 class and\r\nmen from the 626th Infantry Regiment dissolved). It was sent to Verdun\r\nto the Talou sector on May 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. The division, weakened by an epidemic of dysentery, was withdrawn\r\nfrom the front on July 8 and sent to rest in the area of Marville-Jametz\r\nuntil the beginning of August.\r\n\r\n5. It went back into line at this date, on the right bank of the Meuse\r\n(Talou, Hill 344). It lost very heavily from the French attack of August\r\n20 (47 officers and 1,150 men as prisoners) and was relieved on August\r\n30.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of September it occupied the sector of Ville sur\r\nTourbe in Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 28th Reserve Division is recruited mostly from Baden. In addition,\r\nthere are men from Rhenish-Hesse and the Rhine districts. There was also\r\na small number of men from the 4th Corps District (1918 class).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe combat value of the 28th Reserve Division appears mediocre.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire time that it spent on the Somme (October, 1914-July,\r\n1916), the division remained on the defensive.\r\n\r\nHaving lost very heavily on the Somme, it showed no great activity on\r\nthe Somme (August-October, 1916).\r\n\r\nOn the Californie Plateau (May, 1917), the 28th Reserve Division\r\nappeared very much inferior to the guard.\r\n\r\nAt Hill 344 (Aug. 20), the attitude of the regiments of the 28th Reserve\r\nDivision was rather passive, and the resistance was quite weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved south of Beine (Champagne) on February 16.\r\nIt entrained on the following day for Cartignies, near Avesnes, where it\r\nunderwent training for offensive operations. It remained there until the\r\n14th of March, when it commenced to march by night to the front via\r\nEtreux-Fresnoy-Le Nouvion-Wassigny-Essigny le Petit Remancourt, arriving\r\nin line on March 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division was in the front line of the attack at Fayet on the\r\n21st. On the 23d it passed through Savy and reached Vaux. On the 26th it\r\npassed through Parvillers and Erches, proceeding on the 27th via Warsy\r\nto Becquigny. The division distinguished itself in the fighting, though\r\nat a heavy cost. Some companies are known to have lost 75 per cent of\r\ntheir effectives. When withdrawn from the front line on March 29, the\r\ndivision was held in reserve on the front at Davenscourt, Warsy, and\r\nGruny until April 17. Two thousand five hundred men, with a large\r\npercentage of the 1919 class, were received at this time as\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in the Avesnes-Maubeuge area until May 22, when\r\nit marched via Marle-Ste. Preuve-Montaigu May 22–27. The division was\r\nused as an attack division to break through on the Aisne front. It\r\nattacked southwest of Craonne on the 27th and advanced by Corbeny,\r\nsouthwest of Craonne, Merval, east of Fismes, Treloup (30th) and\r\nJaulgonne. Prince von Buchau, the divisional commander, was killed on\r\nMay 30. In the advance to the Marne the division covered 60 kilometers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATEAU THIERRY.\r\n\r\n4. The division was out of line June 3 to 7. On the 8th, it reentered\r\nline before Bouresches (west of Chateau Thierry) where it opposed the 2d\r\nUnited States Division until July 3. Heavy losses were received in the\r\nfighting in the Bois Belleu on June 10–11. The division received a draft\r\nof 200 men in June. The division was withdrawn on July 3 and rested\r\nsouthwest of Soissons from July 7 to 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n5. It was alerted on July 18 and engaged south of Soissons (Berzy-\r\nCourmelles) on the next day. It was heavily engaged until August 1, when\r\nit entrained north of Laon and moved to north of Vouziers on August 1.\r\nHere the division rested until the middle of August. A draft of 400 men\r\nwas received early in August.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division was engaged in the sector north of Mesnil les Hurlus\r\nabout August 20 until the end of the month, when it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n7. After leaving the line at Tahure the division was shifted back and\r\nforth behind the Argonne and Meuse sectors ready to be thrust into line.\r\nIt was moved from Juniville to Longuyon on September 5 and stayed at St.\r\nJean les Buzy (west of Conflans) until the 26th. From there it moved to\r\nthe Damvillers region, and on October 1 was sent to Milly and Villers\r\ndevant Dun.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n8. The division was engaged near Cunel from October 3 to 18, when it was\r\nwithdrawn to Stenay where it received replacements. The company strength\r\nwas brought up to 40–50 men. On the 24th it was again in line near\r\nBantheville and continued in to the end. It fell back north of Villers\r\ndevant Dun on November 1–2, where it was last identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. It was one of the best of the\r\nGerman divisions. It was used as an assault division in the Somme and\r\nAisne offensives and met with great success. Following the attack it\r\nreceived in June in the Bois de Belleu, the division was not seriously\r\nengaged until it was thrown in the Argonne in an effort to stop the\r\nAmerican advance. Its morale remained high up to the last though its\r\neffectives dwindled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             29th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │57.      │113.     │57.      │113.     │57.      │113.\r\n              │         │114.     │         │114.     │         │114.\r\n              │58.      │112.     │58.      │112.     │58.      │112.\r\n              │         │142.     │         │142.     │         │142.\r\n              │84.      │169.     │84.      │169.     │         │\r\n              │         │170.     │         │170.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │22 Drag.           │                   │5th Jag. z.

On August 14 taken to\r\nthe right bank of the Rhine, it entrained for Zabern and took part in\r\nthe battle of the 20th, after which it crossed the French frontier of\r\nLorraine. Suffering heavily on the Meurthe, it retired to Dieuze, from\r\nwhich place it was sent to the front at La Haye west of Pont a Mousson.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. It was transferred to the area north of Arras at the beginning of\r\nOctober, 1914 (front of La Bassee, Ablain, St. Nazaire).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. From October, 1914, to May, 1915, all the regiments of the 29th\r\nDivision suffered heavy losses on the plateau of Notre Dame de Lorette.\r\nOn January 28, 1915, the 3d Company of the 196th Infantry Regiment had\r\nonly 38 men left (letter). The 58th Brigade, especially, which contained\r\na greater number of Alsace-Lorrainers than the others, lost very heavily\r\nin the course of this winter. At the end of November, 1914, the 142d\r\nInfantry Regiment had already had casualties of 44 officers and 2,603\r\nmen. On February 24, 1915, the 2d Company of the 142d Infantry Regiment\r\nhad already received 358 men as successive replacements. But it was from\r\nMay 8 to 13 that the regiments of the division suffered most heavily\r\n(1,000 men of the 114th Infantry Regiment). In March the 84th Brigade\r\nwas taken from the 28th Division and transferred to the 52d Division (a\r\nnew formation).\r\n\r\n2. About May 15 the division was withdrawn from the front and sent to\r\nthe area of Lens, Pont a Vendin, Henin-Lietard.\r\n\r\n3. Sent back into line about May 25 (Souchez-Fond de Buval-Chateau de\r\nCarleul), it again suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division was again relieved about June 13 and sent northeast of\r\nRheims (sector between the Sillery-Beine road and Prosne), on June 18.\r\nIt held these lines until the beginning of November.\r\n\r\n5. During its stay in the Rheims area, the 29th Division sent one\r\nbattalion of the 113th Infantry Regiment into the Champagne battle.\r\n\r\n6. On October 19 and 20 the 112th and 142d Infantry Regiments attempted\r\na gas attack upon the sector La Pompelle-Prosnes. During this period\r\n(June to November, 1915) the losses of the division were insignificant.\r\n\r\n7. About November 10 the 29th Division left this sector to go farther\r\neast, to the Tahure-Butte du Mesnil (Nov. 23). It occupied this sector\r\nuntil the end of September, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. During the entire winter of 1915–16 the 29th Division held the front\r\nof Tahure-Butte du Mesnil without any notable action. In the course of\r\ntheir period of rest in the Vouziers area its battalions continued their\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September, the division was transferred to the Somme.\r\nAfter this time the two divisions of the 14th Army Corps seemed to have\r\nbecome “flying divisions.” The 114th Infantry Regiment was withdrawn\r\nfrom the division and assigned to the 212th Division, later to 199th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n3. On October 4 the 29th Division went into action on the Somme east of\r\nCléry. It was retained in this area until the beginning of February,\r\n1917. On January 31, its regiments, each of which contained four\r\nbattalions since the autumn of 1916, were reduced to three, the men of\r\nthe 4th battalion being assigned to the other three.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. On February 15, 1917, the 29th Division was sent to rest north of St.\r\nQuentin, where it worked on the Hindenburg line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Transferred to the Rethel area on April 1, it was engaged south of\r\nNauroy (west of Cornillet) on the 17th, where it lost heavily. It was\r\nrelieved about April 20 and filled up with men of the 1918 class and of\r\nthe 626th Infantry Regiment, dissolved at the end of April.\r\n\r\n3. From May 10 until about the middle of June, it occupied the sector of\r\nTahure-Butte du Mesnil.\r\n\r\n4. About June 14 it was sent to the rear and rested in the area east of\r\nVouziers-Attigny. The three regiments were filled up with important\r\nreplacements (men of the 1918 class and the last of the 1917 class\r\nincorporated in the army in October, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n5. About July 10–12, the 29th Division entrained for the Verdun front\r\nand was sent into the sector of Avocourt wood. It underwent the French\r\nattack the 17th which caused it great losses.\r\n\r\n6. On August 1 the 29th Division launched an attack to retake the\r\npositions lost on the 17th. Taken to the rear at the beginning of\r\nAugust, it was again engaged at the time of the French offensive of\r\nAugust 20 and counter attacked unsuccessfully (west of Hill 304)\r\nsuffering heavy losses.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved on October 24–25, it went to rest in the area of Joeuf\r\n(Landres, St. Georges, and vicinity), where it was reorganized. The\r\ngravity of its losses caused conscripts of the 1918 class called out in\r\nJune, having only two months’ instruction, to be sent to it (5th company\r\nof the 142d Infantry Regiment for example).\r\n\r\n8. About October 6, the division went back into line on the right bank\r\nof the Meuse (north of Hill 344). It remained there until the last of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 29th Division is recruited almost exclusively in Baden, the regional\r\ncharacter being accentuated by the return of the men from the 14th Corps\r\nDistrict who had been serving in the regiments of the 4th Corps\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nUntil the attacks of April, 1917, the 29th Division was considered a\r\ngood division, well trained and well officered. The cohesion of the\r\ntroops appears to have suffered from the large proportion of raw\r\nreplacements, in consequence of their losses.\r\n\r\nOn August 21, 1917, the 142d Infantry Regiment launched a counter attack\r\n(west of Hill 304) which failed because of lack of cohesion and liaison\r\nbetween the different units and because of the heavy losses caused by\r\nthe French machine guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Beaumont sector until about April 1, when it\r\nwas relieved by the 19th Ersatz Division. It rested in the Montmedy-\r\nVirton area (Meix) from April 6 to 25. The division was high in\r\neffectives at this time, the companies averaging 180 to 200 men.\r\n\r\n2. On April 25–28 the division was railed to Belgium via Sedan-\r\nCharleville-Namur-Bruxelles-Courtrai. It marched to Wervieq, rested\r\nthere until April 30 and marched into line northeast of Mount Kemmel on\r\nthe night of May 1–2.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYS.\r\n\r\n3. The division was in line until May 15 at Kemmel. Losses from\r\nartillery fire were considerable. It was relieved by the 8th Division\r\nand rested at Oostroosebeke (north of Courtrai) until June 14.\r\n\r\n4. On the night of the 14–15, the division entered line east of\r\nLangemarck, relieving the 49th Reserve Division. On July 15, the 49th\r\nReserve Division returned and relieved the 29th Division, which rested\r\nnear Gits (Roulers) until the 25th. Then it entrained and moved to the\r\nLaon district, detraining at Malmaison. From there the division was\r\ntaken in trucks on the Vesle front.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. It held the Courlaudon sector (east of Fismes) from August 1 to 31,\r\nwhen it retreated to the Aisne (Maizy). It was withdrawn about September\r\n8. It rested near Laon until the 15th, when it was reengaged north of\r\nthe Aisne (Allemant) from September 16 to 24. It retreated behind the\r\nAilette Canal (east of Anizy and Chavignon) and was relieved on October\r\n1.\r\n\r\n6. The division left Laon on October 2 and was brought by rail and truck\r\nto Fresnoy le Grand, coming into line on October 6 in that area. On the\r\n7th and 8th French attacks forced the division to withdraw by Croix\r\nFonsomme, Seboncourt. On the 13th the division was relieved by elements\r\nof the 81st Reserve Division and held in rear of the line. On the 18th\r\nit was reengaged south of Le Cateau (Ribeauville). In November the\r\ndivision retreated on the axes Fresmy, Prisches, in the direction of\r\nAvesnes, where it was last identified on November 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. In 1918 it was used to hold\r\nactive defensive sectors. In the middle of October its effectives had\r\ngreatly diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        29th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │29       │28 Ldw.  │29       │28 Ldw.  │29 Ldw.  │28 Ldw.\r\n              │  (Mixed)│         │  (Mixed)│         │         │\r\n              │  Ldw.   │         │  Ldw.   │         │         │\r\n              │         │29 Ldw.  │         │29 Ldw.  │         │29 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │  (427). │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │5 Sqn. 8 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │1 Ldst.

The 29th Landwehr Division was formed from the 29th Landwehr Brigade.\r\nThe latter was transformed into a division on the Russian Front about\r\nNovember 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. Entering Belgium on August 20, 1914, at Charleroi on the 31st, at\r\nBerry au Bac at the end of September, then attached to the 18th Army\r\nCorps north of St. Quentin, then to the 14th Reserve Corps, the 29th\r\nLandwehr Brigade was transferred to the Eastern Front at the end of\r\nMarch, 1915. In April and May it was in Poland south of Rawa; it was\r\nthen attached to the Posen Corps (9th Corps).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n3. The German offensive in the summer of 1915 sent the 28th Landwehr\r\nRegiment to Courland (vicinity of Toukkoum, in August). This regiment\r\ntook up its position in October in the vicinity of Kalnzem (north of\r\nMitau). The 29th Landwehr Regiment, after taking part in the operations\r\nat Vilna, was brought to the east of Olai, in October, and rejoined the\r\n28th Landwehr Regiment in the vicinity of Kalnzem, at the beginning of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. The 29th Landwehr Brigade remained on the Mitau Front (Kalnzem-\r\nChmarden) during the whole of the year 1916 and until March, 1917. It\r\nthen formed a part of the Winecken detachment. In October it received a\r\nnew regiment, the 427th Infantry Regiment, which was taken from it in\r\nJanuary, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. About the middle of March, 1917, the 29th Landwehr Brigade was\r\nrelieved north of Mitau and sent west of Jakobstadt. It appears to be in\r\nreserve in this sector at the time of the operations against Riga. It\r\nthen came into line north of Kreuzburg (vicinity of Jakobstadt).\r\n\r\n2. About the month of November the 29th Landwehr Brigade was transformed\r\ninto the 29th Landwehr Division, which did not prevent the taking of men\r\nfrom the division to reinforce its neighbor, the 77th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nOn the Russian Front since 1914, the elements of the 29th Landwehr\r\nDivision can have only a mediocre combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTHONIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 29th Landwehr Division occupied a very extended sector north of\r\nKreuzburg until March, 1918. The division was sent then to the Polotsk-\r\nVitebsk region and then to the Baltic Provinces. It was in Esthonia at\r\nthe beginning of May; to the west of Reval early in June. “I have been\r\nin Esthonia three weeks now for guard duty,” a man wrote on May 19.

At the beginning of the campaign the 30th Division formed a part of\r\nthe 7th Army (Von Heeringen). Entraining on August 8, 1914, for Upper\r\nAlsace, it fought there until the 13th. It was transferred from there to\r\nsouth of Sarreburg and crossed the French frontier after the battle of\r\nthe 20th. It advanced by way of Raon l’Étape across the Meurthe. At the\r\nbeginning of September it was concentrated near Avricourt and went to\r\nTergnier; from there to Craonne and Hurtebise. It fought there from the\r\nmiddle of September to the middle of October.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated at Laon on October 20, the 30th Division (as well as the\r\n39th Division) arrived on the Lys on the 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. The 15th Army Corps, now a part of the 6th Army, went into action\r\nsoutheast of Ypres, an area in which it remained for almost 15 months\r\n(October, 1914-January. 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. Before our attacks of 1915, the 30th Division was attached, with the\r\n15th Army Corps to the 4th Army. It went into action south of Ypres.\r\n\r\nThe 136th Infantry Regiment left it in April and became a part of the\r\n115th Division (a new formation).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. Toward the end of January, 1916, elements of the 30th Division were\r\ntransferred to Verdun to take part in the February offensive.\r\n\r\n2. On February 24 the 15th Army Corps, which was on the western wing of\r\nthe German attacking forces, went into action on the front of Maucourt-\r\nWarcq.\r\n\r\n3. The regiments of the 30th Division suffered slightly during this\r\nperiod, the battle having been less intense in the Woëvre. Only the\r\n105th Infantry Regiment, in action as a reenforcement of the 3d Army\r\nCorps, suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. The 30th Division was not relieved after the battles of February and\r\nthe beginning of March. It remained in the sector and, on July 11, the\r\n99th and 143d Infantry Regiments took part in a new offensive. On August\r\n8 the 143d Infantry Regiment attacked the works of Thiaumont and was\r\ndecimated. At this time the regiments were filled from day to day by\r\nirregular replacements. (Between July 7 and 19 more than 136 men were\r\nsent to the 11th Company of the 99th Infantry Regiment.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. About the end of September the 30th Division was relieved and sent to\r\nrest in the Cambrai area. It went into line a short time afterwards, on\r\nthe Somme at Sailly Saillisel and remained there one month. It again\r\nlost very heavily (the 143d Infantry Regiment lost half of its\r\neffectives).\r\n\r\n6. Relieved at the end of November, the 30th Division was sent back to\r\nthe Verdun front.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n7. After a rest near Dun sur Meuse, it went into line in the vicinity of\r\nthe Mort Homme, then of the Côte du Poivre and east of Louvemont (from\r\nDec. 15 to the end of January, 1917) without taking part there in any\r\nimportant offensive or defensive engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. On March 1, 1917, it went into line in the sector east of Auberive\r\nand was still there at the time of our spring offensive in Champagne. It\r\nunderwent this attack at the beginning of May and occupied the sector\r\nuntil the middle of August. During this time, between April 17–20 and\r\nthe beginning of May, 1917, the losses of the 30th Division were very\r\ngreat. The effectives of the 105th Infantry Regiment were reduced to 400\r\nmen; this regiment had to be reorganized in the Argonne.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. About August 25 the 30th Division was again transferred to the Meuse\r\nand occupied the trenches in the vicinity of Forges-Bethincourt, where\r\nits losses were slight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n3. About October 24 the division was relieved. The British attack on the\r\nCambrai front on November 20 caused it to be recalled in haste. It was\r\nsent into line on the 23d, and remained there until about December 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. At rest in the Sedan area, it was sent to the Champagne front,\r\nnorthwest of Auberive, about the middle of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nOf the three regiments of the division, one, the 105th Infantry\r\nRegiment, is Saxon. Stationed in Alsace since 1871, it has represented\r\nSaxony in the occupation of the Reichsland, and continues to draw its\r\nrecruits from Saxony. The other two, Prussian, are composed mostly of\r\nWestphalians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 30th Division is a good division and well commanded.\r\n\r\nThe morale, which is good in the 99th and 143d Infantry Regiments, would\r\nseem to be mediocre in the 105th Infantry Regiment (Saxon) in November,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nThis last regiment, very much exhausted on April 17, 1917, was accused\r\nby the other regiments of having given way. It was withdrawn from the\r\ndivision for a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The middle of January the 30th Division relieved the 28th Reserve\r\nDivision near Ville sur Tourbe; it was relieved about the 20th of March\r\nby the 52d Reserve Division, entrained near Vouziers and traveled via\r\nHirson and Marle to the area northwest of Laon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. On the 27th it left and marched via Achery-Vendeuil-Jussy-Flavy le\r\nMeldeux, Freniches-Libermont-Solente-Gruny, reaching Framicourt on the\r\n12th of April, and entered line the following day south of Cantigny\r\n(west of Montdidier). It was withdrawn on May 16.\r\n\r\n3. The division had suffered casualties amounting to 30 per cent of its\r\ntotal effectives, and so when it was withdrawn, it moved to the region\r\nsouth of Roye to refit. Here each company received between 40 and 50\r\n1919-class recruits, after which the division was trained. On June 12 it\r\nreinforced the front near Courcelles (south of Montdidier). It suffered\r\nheavy losses in the fighting that followed, and was withdrawn about the\r\n22d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of June 28–29 the division relieved the 1st Bavarian\r\nDivision astride the Souain-Sommey road. It seems to have been “leap-\r\nfrogged” by the 2d Bavarian Division on the 15th—the opening day of the\r\nChampagne offensive—but it relieved the 2d Bavarian Division on the\r\n19th. It was relieved by the 22d Division on August 10, and went to rest\r\nin the Lens area.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n5. On the 23d of September it left and moved to the Cambrai area, where\r\nit arrived the following day. On the 27th it reenforced the battle front\r\nsouth of Villers Guislain (south of Cambrai). It was pushed back\r\nsteadily in the ensuing weeks, and was withdrawn about the 28th of\r\nOctober, southeast of Englefontaine (south of Quesnoy), and went to rest\r\nin Maubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nUntil this year the 30th had always been considered a first-class\r\ndivision. During 1918, however, it was not used nearly so much as other\r\nshock units. The fact that, although it was in line only a fortnight\r\nafter more than a month’s rest, it was not used in the attack of July 15\r\nin Champagne, but was put back into line as soon as it was seen that the\r\noffensive there was a failure, is significant. It would seem that the\r\nGerman High Command considered it as only a second-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    30th Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │84 Ldw.  │70 Res.  │5 Bav.   │2 Bav.   │5 Bav.   │2 Bav.\r\n              │         │         │  Ers.   │  Ers.   │  Ers.   │  Ers.\r\n              │5 Bav.   │7 and 8  │         │4 Bav.   │         │4 Bav.\r\n              │  Ers.   │  Brig.  │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  Bn.    │         │         │         │\r\n              │10 Bav.  │11 Bav.  │10 Bav.  │11 Bav.  │10 Bav.  │11 Bav.\r\n              │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Res.   │  Ers.   │  Res.\r\n              │         │14 Bav.  │         │14 Bav.  │         │14 Bav.\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.   │         │  Res.\r\n              │         │         │84 Ldw.  │70 Res.  │84 Ldw.  │70 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │9 Res.

The 30th Bavarian Reserve Division, constituted in August, 1914, half\r\nof Prussian and half of Bavarian troops, operated in the Vosges\r\nbeginning with August 17, and entered St. Dié on the 27th.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, with the 39th Reserve Division, formed after it, it made up the\r\nEberhardt Corps, since then the 15th Reserve Corps. These 2 divisions\r\ncomprised a total of 25 battalions, reserve units, Landwehr or Ersatz,\r\nBavarian for the most part, to which were subordinated Landsturm\r\nBattalions.\r\n\r\nThey were scattered, after the retirement of the first part of\r\nSeptember, 1914, among the valleys of the Plaine and the Liepvrette\r\n(Ste. Marie aux Mines).\r\n\r\nThe predominance of Bavarian troops in these Divisions had the effect of\r\ncausing both to be officially called Bavarian. As a matter of fact, they\r\nwere afterwards almost exclusively filled by Bavarian contingents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In 1915 the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division continued to occupy the\r\nsame sector of the Vosges, south of the valley of the Plaine. It\r\nremained there until May, 1917. The 39th Bavarian Reserve Division was\r\nat its left, holding the lines as far as Ste. Marie aux Mines.\r\n\r\n2. In the spring of 1915, the Brigade Ersatz Battalions of the divisions\r\nwere grouped into regiments and became the 2d and 4th Bavarian Ersatz\r\nRegiments, forming the 5th Bavarian Ersatz Brigade.\r\n\r\n3. The two Brigades of the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division took an active\r\npart in the battles of La Fontenelle in June and July, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Vosges sector (south of the Valley of the Plaine, Senones, Le Ban-de-\r\nSapt).\r\n\r\n2. In October, 1916, the 11th and 14th Bavarian Reserve Regiments went\r\nto the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Division and to the 9th Bavarian Reserve\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nThe 30th Bavarian Reserve Division received, in November, the 8th\r\nBavarian Landwehr Regiment from the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Division, and\r\nin December the 15th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment, taken from the 39th\r\nBavarian Division, which received the 2d Bavarian Ersatz Regiment in\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1917, the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division was relieved from\r\nthe Vosges sector, which it had occupied since its formation, and sent\r\ninto line on the Lorraine front (sector of the Seille).\r\n\r\n2. At the end of October, it was transferred to Upper Alsace (north of\r\nthe Rhone-Rhine Canal), where it relieved the 3d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 30th Bavarian Reserve Division is a sector division, as it has\r\noccupied the front either in Lorraine or Alsace since its formation. Its\r\noffensive value is mediocre.\r\n\r\nIn the 8th Bavarian Landwehr and the 4th Bavarian Ersatz Regiments, the\r\naverage age of the men is 38 years. The men of the machine gun companies\r\nare younger, according to the ordinary rule. In the 15th Bavarian\r\nLandwehr Regiment the majority of the men are more than 30 years old.\r\n\r\nEach battalion of the 8th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment possesses an\r\nassault troop composed of young men averaging 24 years of age.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Divisional Assault Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAUTE ALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line north of the Rhine-Rhone Canal until\r\nthe armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division possesses very little fighting value. The men are, for the\r\nmost part, old, and the fathers of several children. Then, too, a great\r\nmany are those—untrained Landsturm—who usually, for physical defects,\r\nwere not inducted into the army when their classes were called to the\r\ncolors; these men complain of the hard work. Moreover, Bavarians came to\r\nbelieve that Prussia was “using” them. It was found necessary to\r\nestablish shock detachments with each battalion, and these do all of the\r\nnecessary patrolling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             31st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │32.      │70.      │32.      │70.      │32.      │70.\r\n              │         │174.     │         │174.     │         │174.\r\n              │62.      │60.      │62.      │137.     │         │166.\r\n              │         │137.     │         │166.     │         │\r\n              │         │166.     │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │7 Uhlan Rgt.       │                   │5 Sqn. 7 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │31 Brig.:          │31 Brig.:          │31 Brig.:\r\n              │ 31 F.

At the beginning of the war the 31st Division was a part of the 6th\r\nArmy (Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria). In August, 1914, it was on the\r\nLorraine frontier; on the 12th of August at Chateau Salins, Rechicourt.\r\nIt fought at Dieuze on August 20, where the 174th Infantry Regiment lost\r\nhalf of its effectives. The division was at Luneville on the 23d,\r\nmarched upon Rehainviller, Gerbeviller on the 24th; at Rozelieure Essey\r\non the 26th; in the vicinity of Moyen-Domptail at the beginning of\r\nSeptember; it withdrew to Dieuze about September 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Transferred to the vicinity of St. Quentin-Vermand, about September\r\n18, the division occupied the vicinity of Fouquescourt on September 26\r\nand 27; attacked in the direction of Bouchoir on October 6. At the end\r\nof October the division took over the front of Fouquescourt-Chaulnes and\r\nkept it until the end of January, 1915. At this date the losses of the\r\n174th Infantry Regiment, since the beginning of the war, amounted to 81\r\nofficers and 3,521 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. About January 25, 1915, the 31st Division left the Somme for the\r\nEastern Front, leaving the 60th Infantry Regiment in France, and\r\ndetrained at Tilsit.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated in Eastern Prussia, at the beginning of February, it was\r\na part of the Hindenburg Army.\r\n\r\n3. On February 14 it left the region of Augustowo to advance to the\r\neast. It reached Sopockin on the 20th and took up its position with the\r\n21st Army Corps on the line Sopockin-Chatbine (north of Grodno). On the\r\n9th of March, in a counterattack of the Russians, it suffered heavy\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n4. From March 29 to April 24 it took part in the battles in the vicinity\r\nKalwaria-Mariampol.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of April it was withdrawn from the front and reorganized.\r\nFrom the time of its arrival in Russia until April 10, the first\r\nbattalion of the 166th Infantry Regiment had lost 17 officers and 1,022\r\nmen, the 1st Company alone losing 5 officers and 336 men.\r\n\r\n6. At the end of July the division again occupied the lines near\r\nMariampol.\r\n\r\n\r\nVILNA.\r\n\r\n7. In the month of August it took part in the offensive upon Vilna. It\r\nadvanced to Kovno on August 19, to Vilna at the end of September, and\r\nreached the area Smorgoni-Soly, where it stopped in October.\r\n\r\n8. The division was relieved on October 6. It went back into line about\r\nOctober 24, in the sector of Postawy-Lake Narotch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH.\r\n\r\n1. The 31st Division occupied the vicinity of Lake Narotch until its\r\ndeparture for the Western Front in December, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of March, 1916, it opposed the Russian offensive in the\r\nvicinity of this lake; it lost very heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. On December 5, 1917, it was relieved from the Russian front, and\r\nafter a few days rest at Vilna entrained for Belgium on December 16.\r\n(Itinerary: Wirballen-Koenigsberg-Elbing-Dirschau-Ramberg (?) Aix la\r\nChapelle-Verviers.) It detrained about the 21st, in the vicinity of\r\nGhent and took up its position at the end of January, 1918 south of the\r\nYpres-Roulers line where it alternated with the 12th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 31st Division is recruited mostly from the vicinity of Sarrebrucken\r\nand St. Wendel in the Rhine Province. Most of the replacements are\r\nfurnished by Westphalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 31st Division was on the Russian front from February, 1915 to\r\nDecember 1917. The quality is mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. From January 19 to February 4 the division held the Moorslede sector\r\n(south of Ypres-Roulers railway). The division rested until the 14th in\r\nthe vicinity of Lendelede. It relieved the 12th Reserve Division on the\r\n14th in its old sector at Moorslede which it held until March 3, and\r\nagain from March 21 until April 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n2. About April 4 the division was withdrawn and marched to the Messines\r\nfront. The route lay through Menin, Werwicq, Comines, Warneton. It was\r\nengaged on April 10 to 12 in the Bois de Ploegsteert. For its fighting\r\nin this area the division was mentioned by the German communique of\r\nApril 13. From the 12th to the 17th, it was in second line. It fought\r\nsouth and southwest of Kemmel from April 18 to 24 when it passed into\r\nclose support until the 26th. The division’s losses were large in this\r\nsevere engagement. The 3d Battalion of the 174th Regiment is known to\r\nhave lost from 60 to 70 per cent of its effectives.\r\n\r\n3. When relieved in the Kemmel area, the division rested north of\r\nTourcoing until May 6, undergoing reconstitution. It returned to line\r\nnorth of Kemmel on the night of May 6–7, relieving the Alpine Corps. It\r\nsuffered heavily from the French attack of May 21, losing many\r\nprisoners. It was relieved on May 24, and rested in the Courtrai-Menin\r\narea until June 15. It was engaged in the sector south of Ypres from\r\nJune 15 until July 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n4. Following its arduous service on the Ypres front, the division was\r\nmoved to a quiet sector on the Woevre. It was moved from Belgium by way\r\nof Brussels, Namur, Charleville, Sedan to Mars la Tour from where it\r\nmarched to the front and took over the St. Mihiel sector on July 29,\r\nwhich it held until September 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n5. The division was resting in the area north of Dampvitoux when the\r\nAmerican attack was made on the St. Mihiel salient. It was brought into\r\nline north of Thiaucourt on the 14th and held this sector until October\r\n28.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. On the 31st, the division was engaged at Imecourt (northeast of\r\nGrandpre) and took part in the final combats in that area. It was still\r\nin line on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. In spite of its relatively low\r\nquality it appears to have been used as an attack division in the Lys\r\noffensive. The losses in the spring and the presence of numerous\r\nLorrainers in its composition lowered the value of the division after\r\nMay, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             32d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │63.      │102.     │63.      │102.     │64.      │102.\r\n              │         │103.     │         │103.     │         │177.\r\n              │64.      │177.     │64.      │177.     │         │103.\r\n              │         │178.     │         │178.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │18 Hus.

Upon the declaration of war the 32d Division, with the 23d Division,\r\nformed the 12th Army Corps (1st Saxon Army Corps). On the night of\r\nAugust 2, 1914, its 64th Brigade entrained for the frontier north of\r\nLuxemburg to act as covering troops. The 32d Division was concentrated\r\nthere on the 10th and entered Belgium on the 13th. In August, it marched\r\nwith the 3d Army (von Hausen), fought on the right bank of the Meuse on\r\nAugust 23 near Dinant, entered France, went into action on the 28th at\r\nSigny l’Abbaye, and from there went down to Chalons. It took part in the\r\nbattle of the Marne to the left of the Guard at Lenharree on the extreme\r\nright flank of the 6th Army and retired by way of Chalons, Mourmelon,\r\nBetheniville to the northwest of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Reattached to the 7th Army (Von Heeringen), it took part in the\r\nattacks in the vicinity of Rheims (northwest).\r\n\r\n3. When the front became stabilized it retained the sector of Berry au\r\nBac-Craonne and remained there until the month of July, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. Sector Berry au Bac-Craonne. (During this period the losses of the\r\ndivision were very small.) In April, 1915, the 178th Infantry Regiment\r\nwas taken from the 32d Division and assigned to the 123d Division (a new\r\nformation).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Retained in the same calm sector and having taken part in no\r\nimportant affair since October, 1914, the 32d Division retained its\r\ncombat value intact at the end of June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. During the first days of the Franco-British offensive on the Somme\r\nthe 32d Division sent one battalion from reserve there, which went into\r\naction from July 4 to July 7 in the vicinity of Belloy.\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of July two of its regiments (102d and 103d Infantry\r\nRegiments) helped to form (with elements from the 23d Division) the\r\nprovisional Franke Division, which fought on the Somme until September\r\n10 (Deniecourt-Vermandovillers). The losses were very heavy.\r\n\r\n4. On the 4th of September the 177th Infantry Regiment was sent up in\r\nits turn, but was in action only a few days in the vicinity of\r\nVermandovillers from September 4 to 10. Its losses were enormous (1,600\r\nmen in 6 days).\r\n\r\n5. The Franke Division was withdrawn on September 10 and dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. The 32d Division, reformed (102d, 103d, 177th Infantry Regiments) and\r\nreorganized, was sent north of Rheims and then to the Argonne (Four de\r\nParis and Avocourt wood).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved at the beginning of November, it entrained on the 3d and 4th\r\nnear Grandpre, detrained at Hirson, and on November 15 began to occupy\r\nthe sector between Bouchavesnes and northeast of Clery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 32d Division was retained in the Bouchavesnes sector until the\r\ntime of the German retirement in March, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. It left the Somme front at the end of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. After a period of rest in the vicinity of Sissonne, the division went\r\ninto action in the sector of Mont sans Nom (4 kilometers west of\r\nVaudesincourt on Apr. 17 and 18). Having lost heavily, the 3 regiments\r\nwere withdrawn on the 19th.\r\n\r\n4. On May 5 the division again went into line west of Tahure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. About June 10 it was relieved, and after a few days of rest entrained\r\nat Machault for Flanders. There it went into line near the Ypres-Menin\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of September it was withdrawn from the Ypres front\r\nand sent to rest, then took over the sector Warneton-Messines and was\r\nnot relieved until the middle of January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 32d Division is exclusively Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1917, the morale of the division was very low because of the\r\nlosses suffered at Mont Haut.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the division’s stay in the Tahure sector from May to\r\nJune, 1917, there were only two desertions.\r\n\r\nBesides, Gen. von Der Decken is considered an energetic commander and it\r\nis very probable that under his influence the morale has become more\r\nsatisfactory (September, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on January 15 by the 49th Reserve Division\r\nand rested near Tournai until the beginning of March. It was railed to\r\nWambrechies and entered the line northwest of Lille about March 1. About\r\nthe 4th of April it was moved south and on April 9 was engaged at\r\nFleurbaix. It was withdrawn to rest on the 16th to Armentieres and\r\nreturned to line on the 18th, relieving the 117th Division. It was in\r\nline until May 8, during which time it suffered heavy losses. A\r\nreplacement of 450 men was received on April 17.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved by the 35th Division, it rested in rear of the Lys front\r\nuntil May 26, when it took over the sector west of Merville and held it\r\nuntil the end of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. It was relieved about July 1 and railed to Lorraine, detraining near\r\nSpincourt on July 4. About this time, the division received a draft of\r\n1500 men. It was in line at Eix-Bezonveaux from July 15 to October 1, a\r\nvery quiet sector. The troops were marched to the rear on that date and\r\nrested in the Eton-Loison area for two days. On the 3d the division\r\nmarched to Penard-Tilly, where it rested until the 5th, and on that\r\nnight marched to Breville. It came into line on October 9 on the right\r\nbank of the Meuse, and was engaged in the Bois de Moirey region until\r\nOctober 24. Losses were heavy, some companies being reduced to 15 men.\r\nOn November 3 the division reappeared in its former sector of Bezonvaux,\r\nrelieving the 106th A. H. D. It held this sector until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It did well on the Lys in April,\r\nbut after that was not seriously engaged except for a few days in\r\nOctober, when it was brought up to resist an American attack east of the\r\nMeuse. In the fighting it did not distinguish itself. The morale of the\r\ndivision was low in the latter half of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             33d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │66.      │98.      │66.      │98.      │66.      │98.\r\n              │         │130.     │         │130.     │         │130.\r\n              │67.      │135.     │67.      │135.     │67.      │135.\r\n              │         │144.     │         │144.     │         │144.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │12 Jag. z.

Reservists began arriving on July 29\r\n(Soldbuecher).\r\n\r\n1. At the outbreak of hostilities the 33d Division was a part of the 5th\r\nArmy (German Crown Prince). It invaded France by way of Audun le Roman,\r\nwent around by the north of Verdun, crossed the Meuse at Givry on\r\nSeptember 1 and advanced as far as Rambluzin and Heippes (20 kilometers\r\nsouth of Verdun).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n2. After the battle of the Marne it took up its position in the Argonne.\r\nIts advance had been costly. On September 24 the new commander of the\r\n98th Infantry Regiment found it reduced 13 officers and 982 men\r\n(document).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 33d Division remained without interruption in the Argonne from\r\nSeptember, 1914, to about the middle of August, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. About August 10, 1916, the division was relieved from the Argonne\r\nand, after a short rest behind the front, was sent into the line at\r\nVerdun, east of Fleury.\r\n\r\n2. In this sector, the division lost rather heavily. It remained there\r\nuntil the middle of September, at which time it took its place in the\r\nsector Vauquois, giving the 144th Infantry Regiment to the 223d\r\nDivision, a new formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. During this latter period, which extended up to the middle of\r\nDecember, the division was reorganized and absorbed the 4th Battalion,\r\nsuppressed, on October 31, in the 27th Landwehr Regiment. At the same\r\ntime, the 4th Battalions which the regiments of the division possessed,\r\nwere broken up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Transferred to the Somme about December 15, it there occupied the\r\nsector east of Beaumont-Hamel and did not leave it until February 8,\r\n1917. During these two months, its losses were rather serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. Sent to rest in the Sedan area, the 33d Division went back into its\r\nold sector Vauquois at the end of February, 1917. No important event\r\nmarks its stay in the Argonne after that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. On May 3, it was relieved and transferred to Champagne. It marched as\r\nfar as Pont Faverger and went into line at Cornillet and Mont Blond. It\r\ntook part in the battle on this front and suffered some losses (172\r\nprisoners from the 130th Infantry Regiment on May 20).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from this region at the end of May, it was again sent to\r\nthe Argonne (Boureuilles-Vauquois), about June 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of September it came out of the Argonne, and about October\r\n4 went to the area of Tahure, where it remained in line until February,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nNot being able to utilize the regional system of recruiting from annexed\r\nLorraine, the 33d Division is composed almost entirely of Westphalians\r\nfrom the 7th Corps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Army Corps, of which the 33d Division is a part, has always had\r\nthe reputation of being one of the best corps of the German Army.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 33d Division lost very heavily during the offensive of\r\nApril and May, 1917, it still appeared strong (October, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on January 4 by the 28th Reserve Division\r\nand went to rest and train in the area northwest of Sedan. On March 14\r\nit was railed to the vicinity of Rozoy sur Serre and rested a week north\r\nof Montcornet. From there the division proceeded by night marches via\r\nMontcornet-Crecy sur Serre-Monceau le Neuf-Ribemont-Mezieres-Moy-ly\r\nFontaine-Gibercourt-Montescourt-Jussy-Flavy le Martel, where it arrived\r\non March 23. On the following night the division was billeted in\r\nVilleselve and came into line astride the Ham-Noyon road on March 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 25th the division fought its way through Noyon and on the\r\nfollowing days was engaged in heavy fighting about Suzoy and Mont\r\nRenaud, which it failed to capture in spite of heavy sacrifices. It was\r\nwithdrawn on April 15.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested from April 15 to May 24 in the vicinity of Dercy,\r\nMortiers, Pierrepont, and Barenton sur Serre undergoing reconstitution.\r\nIt marched to the Aisne front by Coucy les Eppes, Bruyeres, and\r\nChamouille.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division was engaged on May 27 in the front line of the attack\r\nand advanced by Pancy, Courtecon, Verneuil, Pont-Arcy, Dhuizel,\r\nCourcelles, Jouaignes (20th), Oulchy la Ville, south of Neuilly St.\r\nFront, Dammard. In this last region losses were heavy on June 2. It was\r\nrelieved by the 78th Reserve Division on June 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested south of Soissons from June 7 to July 11, when it\r\nmarched to the Marne front by Braisne, Fere en Tardenois, Foret de Ris.\r\nIt was in reserve on the 15th on the north of the Marne, west of\r\nDormans. On the 17th–18th it fell back on Beuvardes and Grisolles and\r\nwas engaged the next day southeast of Neuilly St. Front. In the heavy\r\nfighting of the following days the division was thrown back south of\r\nOulchy le Chateau toward Fere en Tardenois (July 21–23). The division\r\nwithdrew until the Vesle was reached when it was relieved about July 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n6. The division entrained southeast of Montcornet on August 6 and was\r\nmoved to Avocourt via Sedan-Charleville-Montmedy. It rested southeast of\r\nStenay until August 15. Replacements were received from the dissolved\r\n33d Reserve Division in August. On August 21, the division entered line\r\nnear Ornes (north of Verdun) where it remained until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. It was used as an assault\r\ndivision in the Somme and Aisne offensives of 1918. It was disorganized\r\nby its losses in the Marne retreat and never recovered its offensive\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         33d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │66 Res.  │67 Res.  │66 Res.  │67 Res.  │66 Res.  │67 Res.\r\n              │         │130 Res. │         │130 Res. │         │130 Res.\r\n              │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.   │8 Bav.   │4 Bav.\r\n              │         │8 Bav.   │         │8 Bav.   │         │8 Bav.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Res.

Formed at Metz with the 8th Bavarian Brigade and the 66th Reserve\r\nBrigade, the 33d Reserve Division was a part of the 5th Army (German\r\nCrown Prince) at the outbreak of the war. In August, 1914, it took part\r\nin the battles of Nomeny and went to Verdun by way of Gondrecourt,\r\nRouvres, Étain. On August 24 and 25 it was in action at Étain and\r\nsuffered heavily. On August 26 the 10th Company of the 8th Bavarian\r\nRegiment had only 75 men left (notebook).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September, it occupied both banks of the Moselle\r\nsouth of Pont à Mousson, and about September 15 the vicinity of\r\nThiaucourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE-LES ÉPARGES.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September and the beginning of October it went back\r\ninto the sector South of Étain (Riaville, Bracquis). On October 8 the\r\n8th Bavarian Brigade attacked Champlon and Fresnes; the 67th Reserve\r\nRegiment attacked the Ville en Woëvre on October 9. After these battles,\r\nthe 33d Reserve Division took up its position on the Côtes de Meuse\r\n(Combres, Les Éparges).\r\n\r\n3. In November the 66th Reserve Brigade was in Flanders—on the Yser\r\nCanal from November 16 to 24, and left for Lorraine on November 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n1. The 33d Reserve Division remained in line on the Côtes de Meuse until\r\nthe end of July, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. About January 17, 1915, elements of the 66th Reserve Brigade were\r\nsent to the Bois le Pretre and suffered heavy losses. They rejoined the\r\ndivision on the Côtes at the end of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES EPARGES.\r\n\r\n3. From February to the end of April, 1915, the 33d Reserve Division\r\ntook part in the battles of Combres and of Les Éparges; it lost very\r\nheavily there, especially in the actions of February 17 to 20. From\r\nApril 15 to May 1 no less than 140 men were sent as replacements to the\r\n12th Company of the 67th Reserve Regiment.\r\n\r\n4. After reorganization the 33d Reserve Division went to the calmer\r\nsector of Vaux les Palameix, Lamorville.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALONNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division once more suffered heavy losses in the Calonne trench in\r\nMay, 1915.\r\n\r\n6. On July 17, 1915, the 130th Reserve Infantry Regiment was sent in\r\nsupport of an attack on Les Éparges. After this period the 33d Reserve\r\nDivision occupied the sector south of Vaux les Palameix (Chevaliers\r\nwood, Bouchot wood) without taking part in any important engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. On July 25, 1916, the division was relieved from the Côtes de Meuse\r\nand sent to rest until August 25 in the area north of Briey. At this\r\ntime the 8th Bavarian Brigade was detached from the 33d Reserve Division\r\nto serve in forming the 14th Bavarian Division and the 33d Reserve\r\nDivision was reorganized with three regiments, with the 66th Reserve\r\nBrigade and the 364th Infantry Regiment (coming from the 8th Ersatz\r\nDivision).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. On August 26 the division went into line on the front north of\r\nVerdun, southwest of the fort of Vaux. It took part in the battles from\r\nSeptember 2 to 9 in the Vaux Chapitre wood and suffered very heavy\r\nlosses. The 12th Company of the 67th Reserve Infantry Regiment received\r\nat least 142 men as replacements from September 13 to 21.\r\n\r\n3. After being reorganized the division underwent the French attack of\r\nOctober 24, which again caused it considerable losses. Upon its relief\r\nthe 2d Battalion of the 130th Reserve Infantry Regiment was reduced to\r\n45 combatants. (Notebook of an aspirant officer.)\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the front on November 1, the 33d Reserve Division was\r\nsent to rest and to be reorganized. It had suffered so heavily that\r\namong the reenforcements at the beginning of 1917 we find untrained men\r\nof the Landsturm II Ban.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. The division was then sent to Lorraine to the Blamont sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Lorraine front until March 10, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. After a month’s rest in the vicinity of Sarreburg, the 33d Reserve\r\nDivision was transferred to Marle (Apr. 16–19). On April 21 and 22\r\nelements of the division were distributed upon different points of the\r\nAisne front to replace the units exhausted by the French attack of April\r\n16, and soon afterwards were regrouped north of Laffaux Mill. The 33d\r\nReserve Division suffered very heavy losses withstanding the French\r\nattack of May 5 and counterattacking on the days following (May 5–7)\r\n(1,000 prisoners); almost the entire 2d Battalion of the 67th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was captured.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn in part from the Aisne front on May 12, the 33d Division\r\nagain had some of its units in action between the Aisne Canal and\r\nLaffaux Mill until May 23 (German attack of May 16, where the 130th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment suffered heavy losses).\r\n\r\n4. At the end of May the 33d Reserve Division returned to the vicinity\r\nof Sarreburg to rest and be reorganized. It received recruits not only\r\nfrom the recruit depot of Beverloo, but also from the depot at Warsaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. About June 10 it again took over its former sector in Lorraine\r\n(Blamont-Leintry).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n6. On August 23 the division went into action on the Verdun front\r\n(sector of Baumont-Chaume wood). It underwent the French attack of the\r\n26th where it suffered heavily. It again had recourse to the Warsaw\r\nrecruit depot which sent it, among other reenforcements, untrained men\r\nof the Landsturm second Ban.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved about September 10, the 33d Reserve Division was transferred\r\nto Galicia by way of Metz, Frankfort, Erfurt, Dresden, Breslau, Cracow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n8. It was identified in Galicia at the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nAfter the 8th Bavarian Brigade was withdrawn the 33d Reserve Division\r\nwas exclusively Prussian. Its regiments were recruited almost entirely\r\nfrom the Rhine Province and Westphalia. In May, 1917, however, following\r\nthe losses suffered on the Chemin des Dames, a great number of young men\r\ncame from Western Prussia (1918 class), coming from the large depots of\r\nBeverloo and Warsaw. At the end of August the Warsaw depot sent\r\nuntrained men from the Landsturm II Ban from the 9th and 10th Corps\r\nDistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 33d Reserve Division is a good division.\r\n\r\nAt Verdun elements of the division fought vigorously and made the French\r\nadvance very difficult on October 24, 1916.\r\n\r\nBetween May 5 and May 7, 1917, the division launched very violent\r\ncounterattacks against Laffaux Mill. Elements of the 364th Infantry\r\nRegiment succeeded in capturing the Chateau de la Motte. In the sector\r\nof Beaumont at Verdun the 1st Battalion of the 364th Infantry Regiment\r\nput up a very stubborn resistance to the French on August 26, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe 33d Reserve Division was very much exhausted by the attacks on the\r\nAisne. The reenforcement which it received on May 4, 1917, were mostly\r\nmen belonging to the 1918 class. On August 26, 1917, more than one-\r\nfourth of the prisoners belonged to this class.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, it already counted among its ranks young men of the\r\n1919 class, who had arrived on January 14.\r\n\r\nTaking into account its recent long rest and its intensive training in\r\noffensive warfare and the declarations of prisoners captured in March,\r\n1918, who all declare that their division is an assault division\r\ndestined to take part in a great breaking through offensive, we must\r\nconclude that the 33d Reserve Division has again become an organization\r\nof high quality (Mar. 30, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division continued to hold its sector northwest of Rheims until\r\nthe Aisne offensive in May. It advanced with the rest of the line,\r\nhaving as its objective the Marne River. It progressed through Cauroy\r\n(27th), St. Thierry (28th), and Vrigny (31st). Here the line was\r\nstabilized. The division was withdrawn June 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. On June 25 the division relieved the 88th Division in the Mont Têtu\r\nsector (Eastern Champagne). It was on the extreme left of the German\r\nattack east of Rheims on July 15, and suffered so heavily that it was\r\nwithdrawn on July 20.\r\n\r\n3. In mid-August the division was broken up. The 364th and 67th Reserve\r\nRegiments were drafted to the 16th and 34th Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 33d Reserve Division was rated as fourth class. As a result of its\r\nfailure in the Aisne and Champagne offensives, it was disbanded in\r\nAugust, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             34th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │68.      │67.      │68.      │67.      │68.      │67.\r\n              │         │145.     │         │145.     │         │145.\r\n              │86.      │30.      │86.      │30.      │86.      │30.\r\n              │         │173.     │         │173.     │         │173.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │16 Uhlan Rgt.      │                   │5 Sqn. 12 Jag. z.\r\n              │                   │                   │  Pf.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │34 Brig.:          │34 Brig.:          │34 Brig.:\r\n              │ 69 Rgt.           │ 69 Rgt.           │ 69 Rgt.\r\n              │ 70 Rgt.           │ 70 Rgt.           │ 70 Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n              │                   │                   │\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Engineers and│                   │1 Pion.

At the outbreak of the war the 34th Division marched with the 5th\r\nArmy (German Crown Prince), entered France on August 21, by Audun le\r\nRoman and by way of Nouillon Pont, and reached the Meuse, which it\r\ncrossed at Vilosnes and Sivry on September 1. It advanced as far as\r\nBeauzée and Seraucourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n2. After the battle of the Marne it retired to the north and took up its\r\nposition in the Argonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 54th Division remained in the Argonne without interruption from\r\nSeptember, 1914, until about August 15, 1916. It took part there in the\r\noffensives of January and July, 1915, where it suffered heavy losses. On\r\nJanuary 18, 1915, the 30th Infantry Regiment had already lost 56\r\nofficers and 2,723 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n2. After these violent battles, it received fairly large replacements.\r\nThe division suffered no serious losses in this sector during the period\r\nwhich followed these engagements until its relief on Aug. 15, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. On this date the 34th Division was transferred to the right bank of\r\nthe Meuse at Verdun.\r\n\r\n2. It went into action in the Chiaumont sector at the end of August,\r\n1916, and during the month of September, took part in some very severe\r\nbattles in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n3. On September 20, its losses were very great because of our attack.\r\nThe regiments of the 34th Division again lost heavily in the course of\r\nour offensive of October 24, which succeeded in recapturing the\r\nDouaumont Fort and the Thiaumont Works; on that day, their resistance\r\nwas rather weak. The 67th Infantry Regiment received about 71 men for\r\nits 8th Company in the week of October 28-November 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOSGES.\r\n\r\n4. On October 29 the 34th Division was relieved. Beginning with November\r\n14, it occupied a calm sector in the Vosges, southwest of Senones. At\r\nthis time it received fairly large replacements. The 173d Infantry\r\nRegiment was transferred to the 223d Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1917, the division returned to the\r\nArgonne. It remained there a short time. In the middle of March, it was\r\nrelieved and transferred to the region north of Rheims (beginning of\r\nApril).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Immediately after our offensive of April 16, the 67th and 30th\r\nInfantry Regiments went into action in the vicinity of Brimont, while\r\nthe 145th Infantry Regiment was sent to Cornillet as a reenforcement\r\nfrom April 18 to 20.\r\n\r\n3. About April 25, the 34th Division was again concentrated in the\r\nBrimont sector, where it relieved the 43d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n4. About the middle of June it extended its sector to include the\r\nstretch from the Champ du Seigneur to the Verrerie of Courcy. During the\r\nattacks of April the division suffered very heavy losses; the 145th\r\nInfantry Regiment lost about one-third of its effectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. On July 21 the 34th Division was relieved from the Rheims front and\r\nsent to Flanders on August 7. It remained in reserve in the vicinity of\r\nDadizeele until August 12. It then went into action near the Ypres-Menin\r\nroad, where it had heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n6. On August 24, it left this front for La Haye, where it went into line\r\nsoutheast of Thiaucourt (vicinity of Flirey) and remained until October\r\n31.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n7. At the beginning of November, it was in the vicinity of Cambrai. It\r\ntook part in the German counterattack of November 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAONNOIS.\r\n\r\n8. After a rest in December, the 34th Division occupied the sector of\r\nCrandelain, on the Ailette, until January 7, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nBecause of the difficulty of recruiting in its own corps district\r\n(Lorraine), the 34th Division is composed mostly of Westphalians and men\r\nfrom the Rhine Province. The name of “Magdeburg” given to the 67th\r\nInfantry Regiment has only a historic value.\r\n\r\nThe men, as a rule, belong to the classes of 1912 to 1918.\r\n\r\nThe replacements received by the division in Lorraine (September, 1917)\r\nbrought in an undetermined number of men more than 25 years of age,\r\nespecially those of the Landsturm of about 30 years of age, withdrawn\r\nfrom the Russian front and trained for a while in a depot in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 34th Division was one of the good Divisions of the German Army.\r\nNevertheless, at the time of our attack upon Thiamont on October 24,\r\n1916, it had a period of genuine weakness.\r\n\r\nIts attitude in the Brimont sector in April and May, 1917, was such that\r\nit must still be classed among the good divisions.\r\n\r\nAt Ypres, in August, 1917, charged with the defense of one of the most\r\nimportant sectors, it did not realize the hopes of the German High\r\nCommand.\r\n\r\nAccording to the interrogation of a prisoner (February, 1918), the 34th\r\nDivision is a shock division destined to attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n1. Early in January the division which had been resting near Laon,\r\nrelieved the 3d Bavarian Division near Courtecon (south of Laon);\r\nwithdrawn toward the end of February, it went to rest near Liesse\r\n(northeast of Laon), where it remained until March 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. Then it marched toward the front via Marcy (west of Marle) and\r\nRibemont. On the 21st it entered line south of St. Quentin, took Benay,\r\nwhich was its objective, crossed the canal, and took Jussy on the 23d.\r\nIt continued its advance as far as Pontoise (southeast of Noyon). It was\r\nwithdrawn on April 2, after having lost 50 per cent of its total\r\neffectives, and went to rest in the area southeast of Roye. While here\r\nit received 1,000 replacements.\r\n\r\n3. On the 10th, it came back into line south of Guiscard (north of\r\nNoyon). It was withdrawn about the 20th, the 50th Division taking over\r\nits sector.\r\n\r\n4. After spending about 10 days near Beaumont en Beine (southeast of\r\nHam) training in close and open order and in rifle practice, the\r\ndivision relieved the 223d Division south of Appilly (east of Noyon) on\r\nMay 1. On the 15th, it received 15 replacements per company. It was\r\nrelieved by the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division on the 20th, and went to\r\nrest, first in the region east of Chauny, and then in the St. Gobain\r\nforest (south of La Fère).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. After having been in reserve four days near Pernant (west of\r\nSoissons), the division reenforced the front near Ambleny (west of\r\nSoissons) on June 12, attacking, the same day, with the Coeuvres-Vic sur\r\nAisne road as its objective. It could make no headway at all, and\r\nsuffered losses of about 30 per cent of its strength. It was withdrawn\r\nabout the 6th of July.\r\n\r\n6. On the 19th, it came back into line near Vauxbuin (southwest of\r\nSoissons), and was withdrawn on the 22d after suffering severely; over\r\n300 in prisoners alone. It went to rest in the Guise area; later, it\r\nmoved to the vicinity of Coucy le Château. While here, it received as a\r\ndraft the dissolved 67th Reserve Regiment (33d Reserve Division\r\ndisbanded).\r\n\r\n\r\nAILETTE.\r\n\r\n7. The division reenforced the front near Cuts (southeast of Noyon) on\r\nAugust 15. It was withdrawn on September 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n8. It entrained the same day north of St. Gobain, and detrained in the\r\nSt. Bohain region the next day; it rested here for two days, and was\r\ntransported by truck to St. Quentin on the 28th. The following day, it\r\nrelieved the 221st Division southwest of that town. On the 30th, it was\r\nforced to relinquish St. Quentin to the French. It continued to\r\nwithdraw, but fighting stubbornly, and was relieved on the 9th of\r\nOctober near Fontaine-Uterte (northeast of St. Quentin). It rested for a\r\nweek between Avesnes and Maubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUISE.\r\n\r\n9. It moved to the Petit Verly-Grougis region (northwest of Guise) on\r\nthe 17th, in support of the 81st Reserve Division, but that unit being\r\nplaced hors de combat by the attack of the 18th, the 34th Division found\r\nitself in the front line, and even lost nearly 100 prisoners. It was\r\nrelieved on the 23d after losing nearly 700 more prisoners. It then\r\nrested about a week in the Vervins region.\r\n\r\n10. On November 1, it returned to line near Puisieux (south of Guise),\r\nand withdrew along the line Marly, Romery, Sommeron. It was still in\r\nline on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 34th has always been considered as one of the best second-class\r\ndivisions. As a result, however, of its heavy losses during the spring,\r\nit contained large numbers of boys of the 1919 class. Having been\r\nengaged without rest from the middle of August until the end of the war,\r\nit was reduced to the point where it has less than 1,000 effectives\r\nleft. In all probability, it would soon have been dissolved had the war\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             35th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │70.      │21.      │70.      │21.      │87.      │141.\r\n              │         │61.      │         │61.      │         │61.\r\n              │87.      │141.     │87.      │141.     │         │176.\r\n              │         │176.     │         │176.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Jag. z.

The 35th Division formed with the 36th Division the 17th Army Corps\r\n(Danzig). It remained on the Eastern Front from the beginning of the war\r\nuntil October, 1915. It took part in the battles of Gumbinnen and\r\nTannenberg, then in the two German offensives upon Warsaw. It\r\nparticipated in the operations on the Bzura and the Narew, where it\r\nremained until August 1, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. It was sent to rest near Bielostok, and at the end of September,\r\n1915, the decision was made to send it to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n3. It entrained at Grodno about October 6, and arrived about the 10th in\r\nthe vicinity of Péronne where it was filled up. The 9th Company of the\r\n176th Infantry Regiment received no less than 60 men between October 3\r\nand 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of October it went into the Roye sector and remained\r\nthere during the entire winter of 1915–16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. About May 25, 1916, it went slightly to the north and occupied the\r\nsector between the Chaulnes-Amiens railroad and the south of Soyécourt.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July, when the Somme battle began, the 35th\r\nDivision was holding the front from west of Vermandovillers to the south\r\nof Chilly. The 176th Infantry Regiment was sent into line in the sector\r\nof Herbécourt-Estrées on July 2 and lost 170 prisoners to the French.\r\nThis regiment lost heavily in the French attack of July 20 between\r\nBelloy and the Ètoilé wood.\r\n\r\n3. On September 4 and the days following the 35th Division was effecting\r\na relief at the time of the French offensive and suffered considerably\r\nbecause of this (almost 2,000 prisoners, 39 of whom were officers).\r\n\r\n4. It had to be retired from the front on September 8 and sent to rest\r\nat Ham. Between October 15 and 20 it again went into line from the\r\nsouthwest of Chaulnes to the southwest of Chilly.\r\n\r\n5. According to official calculations, the 35th Division had casualties\r\nof 6,102 men, 68 per cent of the effectives engaged, in the course of\r\nthe battle of the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n1. The 35th Division remained in the vicinity of Chaulnes until the\r\nGerman retirement. It took part in the retreat and established itself in\r\nthe Hindenburg Line south of St. Quentin at the end of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. After a few days of rest in the vicinity of Guise at the beginning of\r\nApril, the division took part in the battle of Arras in the second half\r\nof April. At this time it lost about 50 per cent of its fighting men.\r\nThe 141st Infantry Regiment received in May 135 to 140 men per company\r\nto make up for its losses (1918 class and men liberated by the\r\ndissolution of the 618th Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest for the entire month of May in the vicinity of Lille and\r\nfilled up by replacements of 3,000 men coming from the recruit depot at\r\nWarsaw on May 9, the 35th Division was sent into Belgium and occupied,\r\non May 31, the banks of the Ypres-Comines Canal. On June 7 it lost\r\nheavily there (5,000 to 6,000 men, of whom 1,272 were prisoners).\r\n\r\n4. Reorganized on June 11 in the vicinity of Cambrai, by replacements\r\nmostly made up of returned convalescents and wounded, the division was\r\nthen sent into line in a calm sector north of St. Quentin, where it\r\nremained from June 21 to October 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. On October 22 and 23 it reappeared on the Flanders front in the\r\nsector of the Houthulst wood. It had rather serious losses between\r\nOctober 22 and 25.\r\n\r\nIt was relieved on January 22, 1918, and sent to rest east of Bruges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 35th Division is recruited from western Prussia with some help from\r\nthe 6th Corps District, especially in June, 1916 (important replacements\r\nmade up of miners from Silesia). There is a rather large proportion of\r\nPoles, not only from the 17th Corps District, but also from the 5th and\r\n6th Corps Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 35th Division has taken part in numerous battles. Its quality has\r\nbeen greatly weakened by the incorporation of recruits of the 1918\r\nclass, and by the increase of the Polish elements.\r\n\r\nThe 35th Division appears to be a mediocre division (July, 1917).\r\n\r\nThe morale of the 141st Infantry Regiment, 50 per cent of which are\r\nPoles, appears poor. (November, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. The division was at rest east of Bruges (Maldeghem) until about\r\nFebruary 17, when it was engaged in the vicinity of Merckem until March\r\n20.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n2. It entrained at Pitthem on the 22d and moved to Carvin. It was in\r\nreserve at Evin-Malmaison until March 27, and later in reserve south of\r\nLens (near Rouvroy) until April 1. It was moved to Lille and engaged\r\nfrom April 8–9 to the 14th at Neuve-Chapelle, Lestrem, Locon, Neuf\r\nBerquin. In the fighting on April 12 the division lost heavily. It was\r\nwithdrawn on April 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested near Armentiers until May 5, during which period\r\nit was reviewed by the Kaiser. It was in the sector north of Bailleul\r\nfrom May 8 to July 3. At this time the company effectives of the\r\ndivision seems to have been about 50 men. The division rested at Bruges\r\nfrom the 5th to the 17th, when it returned to the Merckem sector and\r\noccupied it until August 18. Considerable replacements were received in\r\nmid-August by the division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. It rested near Lille (Aug. 19–24), and on August 25 was railed to\r\nDouai. On the 26th the division occupied the Drocourt-Queant line and\r\nfought in the area until about September 30, when it was relieved after\r\nlosing 800 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n5. The division was reengaged on October 1 northwest of Cambrai. It\r\nwithdrew to Abancourt (9th), Hem-Lenglet (11th), Denain north of Maing,\r\nFamars (28th), northwest of Maresches (Nov. 1). It passed to second line\r\nabout the 1st of the month, returning on November 9 near Harchies. The\r\ndivision was not in line on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was considered as a good\r\nsector-holding division in 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         35th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │5 Ldw.   │2 Ldw.   │5 Ldw.   │2 Ldw.   │5 Ldw.   │2 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │  (Mixed)│\r\n              │         │9 Ldw.   │         │9 Ldw.   │         │9 Ldw.\r\n              │(z)      │107 Ldw. │(z)      │107 Ldw. │         │107 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3d Res.

It has always occupied\r\nthe Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. At the outbreak of the war the 35th Reserve Division fought (Aug.\r\n25–28) on the southern frontier of East Prussia, which it crossed. It\r\ntook part in the Polish campaign—southwest of Warsaw in October and\r\nNovember, 1914, in the vicinity of Czenstochow in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. From January to March, 1915, the division was in line south of the\r\nPilica. From April to June it took part in the operations in the\r\nCarpathians, then in the vicinity of Lemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of July it was replaced near Sokal (Galicia) by the\r\n39th Austrian Division and went south of Grabowiec. The pursuit of the\r\nRussians led it north of Cholm in the beginning of August, east of\r\nBrest-Litovsk, near Kobrin in September, then to the Chtchara at the\r\nmouth of the Oginski Canal in October.\r\n\r\n3. It took up its position along the canal north of Logischin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nOGINSKI CANAL.\r\n\r\n1. The 35th Reserve Division remained in line along the Oginski Canal\r\nfor more than two years (Oct., 1915 to Feb., 1918).\r\n\r\n2. About October, 1916, the 5th Landwehr Brigade (2d and 9th Landwehr\r\nRegiments) was assigned to the 226th Division (being formed in the\r\nSmorgoni sector). The 35th Reserve Division received two new\r\nregiments—the 420th and 421st Infantry Regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nOGINSKI CANAL.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in the same sector.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1917, the 438th Infantry Regiment became a part of the 35th\r\nReserve Division to replace the 107th Saxon Landwehr Regiment, which had\r\nbeen transferred to the 45th Landwehr Division (Saxon).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nComposed of Landwehr and Landsturm elements, retained for more than two\r\nyears in a calm sector of the Russian front, later in the Ukraine, the\r\n35th Reserve Division has only a mediocre military value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. In March the division advanced into Ukraine, after having furnished\r\nmen to the 10th Landwehr Division, which was about to leave for the\r\nWestern Front. In this advance the division saw some fighting and\r\nconsequently suffered some losses. In April the division was identified\r\nin the Gomel region. The division was identified in Ukraine early in\r\nOctober, and so its reported presence in Flanders on September 20\r\nappears incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             36th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │69.      │129.     │69.      │129.     │71.      │5 Gren.\r\n              │         │175.     │         │175.     │         │175.\r\n              │71.      │5 Gren.  │71.      │5 Gren.  │         │128.\r\n              │         │128.     │         │128.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │5 Hus.

The 17th Army Corps, which comprises the 35th and 36th Divisions, was\r\nsent to East Prussia in August, 1914, where it belonged to the 8th Army,\r\nsoon placed under the command of Von Hindenburg. With this army it took\r\npart in the battle of Tannenberg on August 30, and in the battle of\r\nLoetzen on September 9, then with the 9th German Army (Mackensen), in\r\nthe battle of Radom, on October 6.\r\n\r\n2. In the battles which mark the advance upon Warsaw and then the\r\nretreat, the regiments of the 36th Division, and especially the 5th\r\nGrenadier Regiment, suffered considerable losses (principally at Lodz\r\nbetween Nov. 23 and Dec. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. During the winter of 1914–15 the 36th Division, with the 17th Army\r\nCorps, took part in the actions along the Bzura until June. In July it\r\nwas on the Narew, later on the right bank of the Bug, and at the\r\nbeginning of September on the Chtchara River.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September, 1915, at the time of the pressure exerted by\r\nthe Franco-British offensive, the 17th Army Corps entrained for the\r\nWestern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. Detraining at Peronne on October 10, it was sent to rest in the\r\nvicinity of Ham until October 16. At this date it went into line in the\r\nRoye sector. Until the battle of the Somme it was not seriously engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Upon the outbreak of the Franco-British offensive on the Somme in\r\nJuly, 1916, the 36th Division occupied the sector included between the\r\nsouth of Chilly and the north of Andechy. It was not engaged as a whole\r\nuntil October, the time when the battle front extended as far as the\r\nChaulnes-Chilly sector. Until then it had only sent detached units to\r\nreenforce certain points south of the river.\r\n\r\n2. About the end of September it occupied the front from north of\r\nFouquescourt to the Chaulnes railroad. Relieved between October 15 and\r\n20, and sent to rest between Nesle and Ham, it had to go back into line\r\non October 24–25 to replace, in the sector south of Ablaincourt-Chaulnes\r\nwood, the divisions which our attacks north of Chaulnes had exhausted.\r\nIts regiments lost heavily during this period. The 128th Infantry\r\nRegiment lost more than the others, especially on November 7, 10, and\r\n11.\r\n\r\n3. On December 8 the 36th Division left the front north of Chaulnes and\r\nwas sent north of Roye to the Fouquescourt sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n1. On March 17, 1917, it was included in the retirement and withdrew to\r\nthe Hindenburg Line, where it established itself, on March 23, south of\r\nSt. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. After a month’s rest (Apr. 9-May 9) behind the front, the 36th\r\nDivision went into line southeast of Arras in the Guemappe sector. It\r\nhad only a few local engagements there and did not suffer any great\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n3. It then spent a part of June at rest in the Douai area and took up\r\nits position on July 4 in the sector of Oppy-Gavrelle (Artois). It did\r\nnot take part in any serious engagements there.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved at the end of August, it entrained at Douai on the 28th for\r\nCourtrai and Isegsem. Sent on September 10–11 into the sector of\r\nPoelcapelle, it had to be replaced there on the 23d because of the heavy\r\nlosses which it received from the British attack.\r\n\r\n5. The division left Flanders on September 27 to occupy a calm sector\r\nwest of St. Quentin, where it still was at the beginning of February,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 36th Division is recruited from the same region as the 35th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 36th Division was an excellent combat division.\r\n\r\nIn the battles of the Somme and of Arras the 36th Division gave a good\r\naccount of itself.\r\n\r\nOn the Ypres front the combat spirit of the division was less energetic\r\nthan in the preceding battles. The British Artillery, however, had\r\nreduced its effectives by one-half.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the sector north of St. Quentin about\r\nFebruary 1 and entered the sector south of St. Quentin within a few\r\ndays. It was in line when the Somme offensive came off and advanced in\r\nthe front line by Essigny le Grand, Clastres, Brouchy, Guiscard,\r\nCampagne, Candor. From the 23d to the 25th it was in second line. On the\r\n25th it was reengaged in the Lassigny area. The division was relieved on\r\nApril 8.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested in close support southeast of Roye until April\r\n20. A draft of 300 men was received about this time.\r\n\r\n3. On April 20 the division was engaged southeast of Montdidier (Rollet)\r\nuntil April 28. It was in reserve from the 28th to the beginning of May\r\nin the vicinity of Roye. A draft of 1,000 men was received on April 29.\r\nOn May 9 the division was moved to Wasigny, where it rested until the\r\n22d. It marched toward the Aisne front by night from May 22 to 27 via\r\nRozoy sur Serre, Montcornet, Liesse, Montaigu.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division had in line on the 27th only one battalion of the 128th\r\nRegiment (near Winterberg). The rest of the division followed the\r\nadvance in reserve, passing through Villers en Prayeres, Fismes, Villers\r\nsur Fere. It was engaged from May 29 to the middle of June at Courmont,\r\nFresnes (29th), Jaulgonne (31st), east of Chateau Thierry. The division\r\nwithdrew from the sector east of Chateau Thierry about June 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n5. It rested in the salient (near Fere en Tardenois) until July 14,\r\nundergoing reconstitution. On that date it marched to the front and was\r\nengaged the next day. It crossed the Marne and penetrated south of\r\nCharteves, but was stopped and thrown back on Mezy and Fossoy. From July\r\n20 to 22 it was in second line. Reengaged south of the Ourcq on 22d, the\r\ndivision fought at Rocourt and Villeneuve sur Fere until July 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n6. The division rested near Laon in early August. It was brought up to\r\nresist the British attack north of Bapaume on August 24. It was still\r\nunder strength and was unable to check the advance. It was forced to\r\nfall back on Vaulx Vraucourt, Ecoust St. Mein (27th–30th), Pronville,\r\nand Inchy (Sept. 2–3). The losses in prisoners amounted to 800 in this\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n7. On the 16th of September the division was again in line south of La\r\nBassee. Beginning October 1 it retreated on Bauvin, Pont a Vendin,\r\nProvin (16th), Attiches (18th), and toward the south of Tournai. It was\r\nlast identified at Bany on November 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was heavily engaged in 1918\r\nas a follow-up division in the attacks and to hold important defensive\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         36th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │69 Res.  │21 Res.  │69 Res.  │21 Res.  │69 Res.  │21 Res.\r\n              │         │61 Res.  │         │61 Res.  │         │61 Res.\r\n              │70 Res.  │5 Res.   │70 Res.  │5 Res.   │70 Res.  │5 Res.\r\n              │         │54.      │         │54.      │         │54.\r\n              │         │2 Res.   │         │2 Res.   │         │\r\n              │     Jag.

At the beginning of the war the 37th Division was engaged on the\r\nEastern Front. It took part in the battle of Tannenberg at the end of\r\nAugust, in the attempt against Warsaw in October, and in the battles on\r\nthe Rawka during the winter of 1914 and 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the 37th Division was on the Narew. In May it ceded\r\nthe 146th Infantry Regiment to the 101st Division, a new formation. The\r\nbattles lasted until the end of July on the Narew, which was crossed on\r\nthe 31st. The division was at Bielostok at the end of August, and\r\nentered Grodno on September 2.\r\n\r\n2. In the course of September, it advanced from Niemen to the Berezina,\r\nand in October it occupied a sector in the vicinity of Dvinsk (Lake\r\nSventen) on the stabilized front. It remained there until its departure\r\nfor the Western Front in December, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. One of its regiments, the 150th Infantry Regiment, was temporarily\r\ndetached at the time of the Russian offensive of 1916 on the Stokhod and\r\nthen made a part of the 91st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. After taking part in the terrible battles on the Stokhod, in the\r\ncourse of which it suffered enormous losses, the 150th Infantry Regiment\r\nwas transferred to Galicia at the end of September, 1916, and then\r\nreturned to the 37th Division. The division was sent to the Western\r\nFront on December 10, 1916. Itinerary: Cracow-Breslau-Dresden-Leipzig-\r\nNuremburg-Karlsruhe-Rastatt-Strassburg-Colmar-Neu Breisach.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER ALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. Regrouped with its three regiments in Upper Alsace (vicinity of\r\nFerrette) at the end of 1916, the 37th Division spent some time at rest\r\nand, in the middle of January, 1917, went into line in the sector which\r\nextends from Niederlarg to the Swiss frontier.\r\n\r\nThe division occupied this sector until the month of May.\r\n\r\n2. About May 1 it was relieved, entrained south of Mulhouse and sent to\r\nCharleville by way of Strassburg, Sarrebruecken, and Sedan, from which\r\nplace it went to the vicinity of Gizy (6 kilometers from Sissonne).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. After a week’s rest, it went into line on the Aisne at the Chemins\r\ndes Dames, in the sector of Courtecon, which it occupied until the end\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n4. During these two months (May 25 to the end of July), the 37th\r\nDivision did not play an important rôle. However, units of the division\r\ncarried out several local operations in the course of this period. On\r\nJuly 14, units from the three regiments aided by the assault troops of\r\nthe 5th Assault Battalion, succeeded, at the expense of very heavy\r\nlosses, in reducing a salient near the Cerny sugar refinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n5. On July 31 the 37th Division was relieved, and about August 3 went\r\ninto line in the St. Gobain sector (in front of Coucy le Chateau) which\r\nit occupied until the end of November. On October 23 it suffered losses\r\n(Mont des Singes) from our bombardments. On the 24th the division\r\nwithdrew its units across the canal and occupied the sector included\r\nbetween the Brancourt-Quincy road and Anizy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 37th Division is recruited from East and West Prussia. During its\r\nstay on the Eastern Front it contained a large number of Alsace-\r\nLorrainers. Because of its circumscribed territorial extent, the 37th\r\nDivision contains an admixture of elements coming from other districts\r\n(5th and 6th Corps Districts among others). Nevertheless, and in spite\r\nof their official designations (from Moravia, from Ermeland), its\r\nregiments are called “East Prussian” in the German communique of July\r\n15, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 and 15, 1917, the 37th Division attacked with great energy.\r\nAt that time, it seemed to be of good quality and of high morale.\r\nHowever, according to statements of prisoners of the 151st Infantry\r\nRegiment made in September, October, and November, the morale appears to\r\nhave weakened (Jan. 18, 1918).\r\n\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n1. During January and early February the 37th Division and the 14th\r\nReserve Division relieved each other in the St. Gobain sector (north of\r\nSoissons). It seems probable (though the fact has never been proved)\r\nthat during one of its periods out of line, the 37th Division was given\r\na course of training in open warfare. On February 20, the 37th relieved\r\nthe 14th Reserve in the same sector, and it was in turn relieved by the\r\n14th Reserve about the 9th of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On March 21 the division reinforced the front near Benay (south of\r\nSt. Quentin) attacking with such dash that it received special mention\r\nby Prof. Wegener in the Koelnische Zeitung. It was withdrawn on the\r\n30th.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested for a few days between Champs and Folembray\r\n(north of Soissons), and then entered line north of Thiescourt (west of\r\nNoyon) on the 9th of April. It was withdrawn about the 20th, and went to\r\nrest and refit in the area southeast of Avesnes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. On May 27, the first day of the battle of the Aisne, the division\r\nattacked near Presles (south of Laon), and advanced via Braine (the\r\n28th) as far as the Troesnes-Longpont sector (east of Villers\r\nCotterets). It was relieved by the 115th Division on the 4th of June,\r\nand went to the area northeast of Braine to rest and to be thoroughly\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n5. It set out the evening of the 12th of July, and in two night marches,\r\nreached its point of assembly in the woods north of Verneuil (northeast\r\nof Dormans). It was planned that the 37th with three other divisions,\r\nforming the v. Conta Group, should “leap-frog” the divisions in line,\r\nand to sweep up the valley of the Marne, beginning with the line\r\nVincelles-Antheney and ending at a line passing north of Avenay and\r\nnorth of Moslins. It was thought that this movement, combined with the\r\npush of the units to the east of Rheims, would result in the fall of\r\nthat city and also of the Montagne de Rheims to the south. The division\r\nattacked on the 15th, crossed the Marne, reached the Bois du Chataignier\r\n(south of Mareuil-east of Dormans); and was stopped there. It delivered\r\nits last counterattack on the 19th, and the order having been given,\r\ncrossed the Marne, and continued its retreat toward the north. It was\r\nidentified by prisoners for the last time on the 28th in the vicinity of\r\nChampvoisy (north of Dormans). It then went to the Charleville area to\r\nrest and refit; the 10th Landwehr Division having been disbanded, the\r\n372d Regiment was drafted to the regiments of the 37th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n6. During the night of the 12th–13th of August, it relieved the 231st\r\nDivision to the north of Avocourt (north of Verdun). It was relieved by\r\nthe 117th Division about the 20th of September, and moved to the\r\nvicinity of Billy (south of Longuyon,) where it rested for about a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. On September 26, it reinforced the 117th Division near Montfaucon,\r\nwhere they counterattacked the same day. It was heavily engaged until\r\nwithdrawn October 1.\r\n\r\n8. It moved some kilometres to the west, in the vicinity of Exermont, in\r\nanticipation of the American attack of October 4, and came into line in\r\nthat region on the 5th. It was engaged in a number of minor actions,\r\nthat proved quite costly; its losses in prisoners alone was 962. It was\r\nwithdrawn on the 18th, and went to rest near Verpel (northeast of\r\nGrandpre).\r\n\r\n9. On November 9, the division came back into line near Abaucourt\r\n(northeast of Verdun); it had not been withdrawn on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 37th has always been considered a first-class shock division. It did\r\nvery well in the offensives in which it took part (Somme, Aisne, Marne),\r\nand one of its regiments, the 147th, “The Marshal von Hindenburg\r\nRegiment” was particularly mentioned in the German Communique for its\r\nwork on October 10. It suffered such heavy losses throughout the year\r\nthat, despite numerous large drafts of replacements, the regiments were\r\nreduced to four companies of 80 men each at the end of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             38th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │76.      │71.      │76.      │71.      │83.      │94.\r\n              │         │95.      │         │95.      │         │95.\r\n              │83.      │94.      │83.      │94.      │         │96.\r\n              │         │96.      │         │96.      │         │\r\n              │   11 Jag.

At the outbreak of the war the 38th Division, forming the 11th Army\r\nCorps with the 22d Division, belonged to the 3d Army (Von Hausen), which\r\nwent through the Belgian Ardennes. It halted in front of Namur until the\r\nsurrender of this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST PRUSSIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n2. In consequence of the invasion of East Prussia, the 38th Division as\r\nwell as the 22d Division, left Belgium about August 27. Going by way of\r\nAix la Chapelle, it detrained in East Prussia, where it fought from\r\nSeptember 9 to 11. From that place it was taken to the southern part of\r\nPoland (Pinczow, Sept. 28; Opatow, Oct. 4). The enveloping movement of\r\nthe Russians obliged it to retire from the Lodz front with the army\r\ngroup to which it was attached. It was assigned to the 9th Army\r\n(Mackensen) in November and to the 10th Army in December.\r\n\r\n3. During the winter of 1914 and 1915 it took part in several important\r\nengagements on the Bzura and the Rawka, as well as on the Pilica.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. Returning to the 9th Army (Von Fabeck), at the beginning of 1915, the\r\n38th Division fought in the vicinity of Rava, on March 6 and 7. It was\r\nthen separated from the 22d Division and rejoined the army detachment of\r\nVon Gallitz, north of Warsaw. In May it transferred the 71st Infantry\r\nRegiment to the 103d Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. During the summer offensive it took part in numerous battles from\r\nJuly 13 to September 19, advanced to the southeast of Bielostok, reached\r\nthe Svislotch on September 1 and marched beyond this until September 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September the 38th Division was concentrated in the\r\nvicinity of Grodno and entrained for France on September 25. (Itinerary:\r\nLyck-Graudenz-Berlin-Hanover-Minden-Cologne-Aix la Chapelle-Liege-Namur-\r\nDouai.) Detraining on October 1, it completed its reorganization.\r\nBetween August 30 and October 8 the 5th Company of the 94th Infantry\r\nRegiment had received not less than 161 men as replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to the south of the Oise, the 38th Division went into line in\r\nthe sector of Tracy le Val., which it held until the beginning of May,\r\n1916, without any serious engagements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. On May 11, 1916, the division entrained at Tergnier and was\r\ntransferred to the Verdun front.\r\n\r\n2. On May 13 it took over the sector of Hill 304, which it did not leave\r\nuntil October 10, seriously weakened by the battles which it had\r\nsustained for five months (losses, 52 per cent of the infantry).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to the Somme on October 12, it went into action on October 12;\r\nit went into action on October 22 at Thiepval-Grandcourt, and remained\r\nthere only three weeks, because of the severe losses which it suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. It left the front on November 13 to go to rest and to be reorganized\r\non the coast of Flanders, between Ostend and the Dutch frontier.\r\n\r\n5. On December 19 it was brought back to the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, elements of the division were sent as\r\nreenforcements north of Courcelette and southwest of Serre.\r\n\r\n2. On January 17 the entire 38th Division went into line in the vicinity\r\nof Puisieux-Hébuterne, where it was relieved about March 8 without any\r\nserious losses.\r\n\r\n3. On March 17 the division replaced the 4th Guard Division near Beugny\r\nBertincourt, which had lost heavily at the beginning of its retirement\r\nto the Hindenburg Line, and the 38th Division itself continued to\r\nwithdraw by way of Beaumetz and Doignies. It took up its position\r\nbetween Demicourt and Boursies, west of Cambrai, and remained there\r\nuntil the end of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. After a period of rest in the Cambrai-Douai area during the first\r\nhalf of May, the 38th Division took over the sector east of Arras (north\r\nof the Scarpe), on May 16. It left this front on May 31, after having\r\nbeen greatly weakened on the 16th, during the counterattacks on the\r\nvillage of Rouex (800 men were sent to make up these losses from the\r\ndissolved 624th Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. The division remained at rest at Douai, until June 8; at this time,\r\nit was transferred to the vicinity of Gheluwe and sent into reserve to\r\nreenforce finally the Messines front.\r\n\r\n6. On July 27, before the British attack, the 38th Division went into\r\nline east of Ypres (Hooge). It suffered heavy losses on July 31, the day\r\nof the attack, and also the three days preceding.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved on August 1, it was sent to Antwerp for rest and\r\nreorganization (August).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n8. On September 2, it took over the sector of Monchy le Preux, south of\r\nthe Scarpe, where it again lost heavily from artillery fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n9. Withdrawn from the front on November 2, the 38th Division after a\r\nweek’s rest in the vicinity of Douai, again took over the lines north of\r\nYpres (Staden) from November 19 to November 25, then north of\r\nPasschendaele where on December 3, a British attack inflicted heavy\r\nlosses upon it.\r\n\r\n10. The division was relieved on November 19 and sent to rest in the\r\nvicinity of Bruges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 38th Division is recruited from the small Thuringian States. At the\r\nbeginning of 1917, it included a rather large number of men from Baden,\r\nalmost all of whom have been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 38th Division is a good division.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it gave a good account of itself in the numerous battles in\r\nwhich it took part. On June 13, 1916, however, at the Mort Homme, the\r\n94th Infantry Regiment is said to have refused to go over the top\r\n(letter).\r\n\r\nThe heavy losses which it suffered at the end of 1917 in the course of\r\nthe attack upon Ypres, were made up by the replacements composed, for\r\nthe most part, of the 1918 class.\r\n\r\nThis element did not have a good effect upon the morale of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in Passchendaele area until its relief by the\r\n58th Division about April 5. It rested in the Lille area until the night\r\nof April 15–16 when it entered the line at Meteren to reenforce the\r\nbattle line. It was withdrawn about May 8.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested at Provin after May 12. It entered line north of\r\nGivenchy on May 21 and held that sector until July 5, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 1st Guard Reserve Division. It rested at Lille until\r\nAugust 6, when it was alerted and railed to Cambrai, remaining there\r\nuntil August 9. The division moved from Cambrai by motor trucks on\r\nAugust 10 and came into line on the battle front near Lihons on the same\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Until September 22, the division was engaged in resisting the allied\r\nadvance. It held a sector south of Chaulnes until August 20, when it\r\nretired to the St. Christ area (22d). After the 8th of September the\r\ndivision was falling back in a northeasterly direction by Péronne toward\r\nLe Catelet. It was withdrawn from line near Hargicourt on September 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest of only one week, the division was brought back to\r\nreenforce the Cambrai battle front at Rumilly (Oct. 1). It was heavily\r\nengaged until October 16 when it went to reserve in the Cambrai area.\r\nSince August 11 the division had lost more than 2,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n5. On October 29, the division returned to line northeast of Roubaix. It\r\nremained in line until the armistice. The last identification was at\r\nRenaix on November 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. Its worth as a defensive\r\ndivision was proved by the extent to which it was used in the last three\r\nmonths of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        38th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │38 Ldw.  │77 Ldw.  │38 Ldw.  │77 Ldw.  │38 Ldw.  │77 Ldw.\r\n              │(Mixed). │78 Ldw.  │(Mixed). │78 Ldw.  │(mixed). │78 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │                   │                   │1st Mobile Ers.\r\n              │                   │                   │Abt. 59 F.

The 38th Landwehr Brigade remained independent until it was assigned\r\nto the 38th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. Arriving at Liége on October 21, 1914, the 38th Brigade remained\r\nthere about two months. Transferred to Flanders on October 27, it held\r\nthe sector north of the Passchendaele Canal (Nieuport) until the\r\nbeginning of November.\r\n\r\n3. After occupying the front of Ypres near Becelaere, the brigade came\r\ninto line before Passchendaele at the end of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the 38th Landwehr Brigade took part in the second\r\nbattle of Ypres near Zonnebeke.\r\n\r\n2. On May 18 it was transferred from Roulers to La Bassée (Festubert) to\r\nreenforce the 7th Army Corps.\r\n\r\n3. After a rest at Lille it went into line south of the Lys\r\n(Frelinghien-Houplines) at the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved from the north of Armentieres in March, 1916, the 38th\r\nLandwehr Brigade was sent south of Arras (sector Wailly-Blaireville).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of September it returned to the Armentieres front (from\r\nthe Armentières-Lille railroad to Aubers). It occupied this sector for a\r\nyear and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In 1917 sector south of Armentières.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1917, the 38th Landwehr Brigade was transformed into the 38th\r\nLandwehr Division by the addition of a third regiment, the 79th Reserve-\r\n85th Landwehr, a composite regiment (1st and 2d Battalions of the 85th\r\nLandwehr Regiment, four companies of the 79th Reserve Regiment, the\r\neight others having entered into the composition of the 440th Reserve\r\nRegiment of the 183d Division).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 38th Landwehr Division, formed of fairly old men, constitutes an\r\norganization of the third class. It held an honorable position in the\r\nbattles of Ypres in 1914 and 1915, but, as a rule, its rôle was limited\r\nto occupying calm sectors. (Belgian Summary of Information, February,\r\n1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The 38th Landwehr Division was relieved on January 16 in the sector\r\nsouth of Armentieres by the 187th Division and went to rest in the\r\nregion east of Bruges.\r\n\r\n2. After a week’s rest it relieved the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division\r\nnorth of Dixmude on January 22. It was relieved by the 214th Division on\r\nFebruary 20.\r\n\r\n3. On March 3 it relieved the 2d Naval Division east of Ramscappelle\r\n(north of Bruges) in the sector just north of the one it previously\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n4. About the 10th of May the division side slipped toward the south, and\r\nin so doing relieved the 19th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n5. About the middle of October it side slipped southward. It was still\r\nin line on the 11th of November, although it was forced with the rest of\r\nthe German line in Flanders, to withdraw considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 38th Landwehr is rated as a fourth-class division. It could be and\r\nwas used only to hold a quiet sector. Most of the men were nearly 40\r\nyears of age, and so it was found necessary to have a divisional\r\n“Stosstrupp” for purposes of patrolling.\r\n\r\nOn November 1 the Franco-American forces in Belgium started an offensive\r\nin conjunction with the British 2d Army farther to the south. On the\r\nsame day, according to the Belgium communique, “The Belgian Army carried\r\nout successful minor operations along the drainage canal,” and the\r\nGerman communique said, “The 57th (13th Reserve Division) and the 79th\r\nReserve (38th Landwehr Division) Infantry Regiments distinguished\r\nthemselves in the course of this fighting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             39th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │61.      │126.     │61.      │126.     │61.      │126.\r\n              │         │132.     │         │132.     │         │132.\r\n              │82.      │171.     │82.      │171.     │         │172.\r\n              │         │172.     │         │172.     │         │\r\n              │    8 Jag.

Upon mobilization, the 39th Division and the 30th Division formed the\r\n5th Army Corps (Strassburg).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the campaign the 39th Division was a part of the 7th\r\nArmy (Von Herringen). In the first days of August it fought in the pass\r\nof the Bonhomme. On the 9th it went into Cernay and Mulhouse and was\r\ntransferred to Dabo (Vosges) on August 19. On August 20 it took part in\r\nthe battle of Albreschwiller and crossed the frontier on the 31st. It\r\nadvanced to a point between the Meurthe and the Mortagne and then\r\nretreated fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Entraining on September 9, it was transferred to the northwest of\r\nRheims, where it fought between Craonne and Ailles until October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of October it became a part of the 6th Army (Crown Prince\r\nof Bavaria), of which the 15th Army Corps formed the right wing (north\r\nof Lille) until the summer of 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. Before our attacks of 1915 it was attached to the 4th Army (Duke of\r\nWurttemberg), south of Ypres. At this time the 15th Army Corps became\r\nthe left wing of the 4th Army. In April the 39th Division gave the 171st\r\nInfantry Regiment to the 115th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. The 39th Division was retained in the vicinity of Ypres until the\r\nmonth of February, 1916. One of its regiments, the 172d Infantry\r\nRegiment, suffered heavy losses there on September 25 (its 8th Company\r\nreceived at least 111 men as replacements between September 28 and\r\nOctober 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1916 various elements of the 15th Army Corps were\r\ntransferred to the vicinity of Verdun and concentrated on the right bank\r\nof the Meuse, in the area Piennes-Etain-Ornel-Senon.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of the German offensive on February 24, the 39th\r\nDivision suffered relatively few losses, the battle being less intense\r\nin the Woevre. But little by little all its units were engaged. On March\r\n8, the 132d Infantry Regiment took part in the attacks upon Douaumont,\r\nand on the 18th upon the Caillette wood. Its losses were enormous. On\r\nJuly 11 the 126th Infantry Regiment was in action with two regiments of\r\nthe 30th Division. Almost all its battalions went successively to the\r\nactive sectors in the vicinity of Vaux (Aug. 18). At Verdun the division\r\nlost 69 per cent of its infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. On October 20 the 39th Division was relieved from the Verdun front\r\nand transferred to the Somme. On the 29th it occupied the sector of\r\nSailly Saillisel. In the attack of Sailly Saillisel by the French troops\r\nthe three regiments of the division were all put into line\r\nsimultaneously and acted especially with the assault troops. In these\r\nbattles the losses of the division were very great (an average of 80 men\r\nper company). In the 126th Infantry Regiment, the 4th Company received\r\nat least 82 men as replacements between November 16 and 23; the 3d\r\nCompany, 106 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the Somme, about November 11, the 39th Division was\r\nagain sent to Verdun. Between December 8 and December 12 it went into\r\nthe sector between the Louvemont road and the Chaufour wood and there\r\nsustained our attack of December 15. It was relieved on the 20th, very\r\nmuch exhausted, and went for reorganization near Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n1. About January 10, 1917, the division went into line in the sector of\r\nVille sur Tourbe (Argonne). It was withdrawn at the beginning of March.\r\nIn the course of this month, it was engaged in Champagne, in the attack\r\nof March 27 at Cernay en Dormois. It remained in the sector of Massiges\r\nuntil the beginning of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. It then went to the vicinity of Rheims (Loivre-Berry au Bac sector)\r\nfrom May 11 to the beginning of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest near Asfeld, it then went into line west of Fontaine les\r\nCroisilles (middle of July). Withdrawn from the Arras front, it occupied\r\nthe Loos sector in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of October, it went to Flanders, Passchendaele sector,\r\nthen Becelaere sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of November, it was again in Artois, north of La Bassee\r\nCanal, a position which it was still occupying February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 171st and 172d Infantry Regiments are recruited in the Rhine\r\nDistrict, in the widest sense of the word (Grand Duchy of Baden, Rhenish\r\nHesse, Rhine Province), and from Westphalia.\r\n\r\nThe 126th Infantry Regiment, in Alsace since 1871, represents the\r\nparticipation of Wurttemberg in the guard of the Reichsland. Besides its\r\nmaintenance by the younger recruiting classes, at the end of 1916 it\r\ntook some of the best elements from the 123d, 125th, and 126th Landwehr\r\nRegiments (young Landsturm classes, then having at least 20 to 22 months\r\nof service).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its relatively high losses, the 39th Division did well on\r\nthe Somme (October to November, 1916). During its second engagement at\r\nVerdun, the Division was much less brilliant. Its resistance was weak\r\n(December, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE.\r\n\r\n1. During the night of February 25–26 the 39th Division was relieved by\r\nthe 44th Reserve Division and went to rest near Sequedin (west of\r\nLille), where it is presumed to have been trained in open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of March, when the Germans were concentrating their\r\nreserves on the Cambrai-St. Quentin front, the 39th Division left the\r\nLille area for the Cambrai front. On the 21st of March, when the initial\r\nattack was delivered, the 39th Division was in reserve to the 20th\r\nDivision and only came into action on the evening of that day, at\r\nBeaumetz (west of Cambrai). Encountering fighting of the severest kind,\r\nthe division had to be withdrawn to reserve by the evening of the 23d.\r\n\r\n3. The division reappeared in line on the 28th and continued to make\r\nslow progress until it reached the area south of Hebuterne (west of\r\nBapaume). It was relieved on the 6th of April by the 26th Division and\r\nwent to rest in the Cambrai area.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYS.\r\n\r\n4. It left this area about the 12th and marched by stages to the Lys\r\nbattle front, arriving on the 17th in the Estaires area (west of Lille).\r\nThe German attacks in this area had been successfully held up by the\r\nBritish by this time and the division was not immediately required. On\r\nthe 30th it came into line northwest of Merville (west of Lille) and\r\nrelieved the 12th Reserve Division. The division was not heavily engaged\r\nin this sector; it was relieved by the 44th Reserve Division on May 26\r\nand went to rest in the vicinity of Lille.\r\n\r\n5. On the 3d of July it relieved the 48th Reserve Division in the Vieux\r\nBerquin sector (east of Hazebrouck), and was relieved by the 187th\r\nDivision during the night of July 13–14. It went to the Haubourdin area\r\n(southwest of Lille) and there received training as an assault division.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n6. During the night of August 2–3 it relieved the 185th Division south\r\nof Neuville-Vitasse (south of Arras). In the heavy fighting that\r\nfollowed the division lost over 1,300 prisoners and was driven back as\r\nfar as Cherisy, where it was withdrawn on the 30th and went to rest near\r\nAniches (east of Douai).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n7. On September 18 the division reenforced the front near Ecourt-St.\r\nQuentin (northwest of Cambrai). It was driven back as far as Palluel,\r\nwhere it was relieved by the 58th Division on the 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n9. The division entrained at Roulers and detrained at Menin, entering\r\nline east of Gheluvelt (north of Menin) all on the same day. About the\r\n25th of October it was withdrawn from line near Vichte (east of\r\nCourtrai) to which point it had been driven back. It rested then for\r\nabout a week in the region of Audenarde.\r\n\r\n10. During the night of October 31-November 1 the division relieved the\r\n23d Reserve Division in the Nukerke sector (south of Audenarde); it was\r\nidentified in line there on the 9th and was probably still there on the\r\n11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 39th is rated as a second-class division. With the exception of a\r\nstatement in the German communique of October 2, that the 132d Regiment\r\nhad displayed “unusual fighting ability” in the operations north of\r\nMenin, there is nothing to show that the division had distinguished\r\nitself in any way in the fighting during 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    39th Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Bav.

In July the division comprised the 1st Bavarian Ersatz Brigade\r\n(1st and 3d Bavarian Ersatz Regiments) and the 9th Bavarian Ersatz\r\nBrigade (the 15th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment and the 5th Bavarian Ersatz\r\nRegiment, the latter having been formed in July).\r\n\r\n3. In October the 3d Bavarian Ersatz Regiment was assigned to the 9th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division and the 29th Ersatz Regiment to the 223d\r\nDivision, both being new formations. From that time on the 39th Bavarian\r\nReserve Division was entirely Bavarian.\r\n\r\nIn November the 15th Bavarian Landwehr Regiment went over to the 30th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division, which sent the 2d Bavarian Ersatz Regiment in\r\nits place to the 39th Bavarian Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved from its sector in the Vosges about November 6, 1916, the\r\n39th Bavarian Reserve Division was sent to the Verdun front in the\r\nvicinity of Vaux.

The 40th Division (4th Saxon) formed, with the 24th Division (2d\r\nSaxon), the 19th Army Corps, which, at the outbreak of the war, was a\r\npart of the 3d Army (Von Hausen). Detraining north of Trèves August\r\n10–12, the division entered the north of Luxemburg on the 13th, Belgium\r\non the 18th. It crossed the Meuse on the 23d above Dinant, and entered\r\nFrance by way of Fumay. It fought on August 30 at Chesnois, reached\r\nSemide on September 1, Somme Py on September 2, Châlons on September 4.\r\nOn liaison with the right wing of the 4th Army, it took part in the\r\nbattle of the Marne west of Vitry le François. After the battle it\r\nretired to Souain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of October the 19th Army Corps was transferred to\r\nLille. It belonged to the 6th Army (Crown Prince of Bavaria). Attacked\r\nby the British troops, it was forced back upon the line between\r\nPloegsteert wood and Grenier wood.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October the 9th Company of the 107th Infantry Regiment\r\n(24th Division) had only 38 men left (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. In 1915 and until August 1916 the two divisions of the 19th Army\r\nCorps were retained in the zone of Ploegsteert and Grenier wood.\r\n\r\n2. Elements of the 40th Division were sent as reenforcements in the\r\nbattles of Neuve Chapelle (March 1915), of Festubert (May to June 1915)\r\nand upon the occasion of the Franco-British offensives in Artois (La\r\nBassee-Souchez, June to October 1915). In March 1915, the 40th Division\r\nwas definitely reduced to three regiments, having given the 133d\r\nInfantry Regiment to the 24th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. On August 8, 1916, the 40th Division took part in the battle of the\r\nSomme in the region north of Pozières. It was in violent battles and was\r\nwithdrawn, very much exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of August, it went from the Somme front to the sector of\r\nNeuve Chapelle-La Bassée Canal, where it remained for six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. About the middle of October, it returned to the Somme (sector north\r\nof Le Sars-Butte de Warlencourt) for a second period of three weeks\r\nduring which its losses were again very heavy (the total losses of the\r\n40th Division in August and October on the Somme were 6,127 men).\r\n\r\nOn October 30, the 7th Company of the 104th Infantry Regiment received\r\nat least 75 men as replacements (1917 class) who had had only three\r\nmonths of service.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved from the Somme, the Division went into the sector of St.\r\nEloi-Messines about November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division left the Messines front about March 26, before the\r\nbeginning of the British offensive at Arras, and remained at rest in the\r\narea of Renaix.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. It returned to line on April 23 in the same sector, and was subjected\r\nto the artillery preparation for the battle of Messines, which caused it\r\nextremely heavy losses. The 104th Infantry Regiment lost 224 men as\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, the first day of the attack, it was withdrawn from the front\r\nand sent to rest in the vicinity of Bruges and Thielt until July 19.\r\n\r\n3. On July 22 it went into line north of Ypres in the sector of\r\nSteenstraat-Het-Sas. It suffered the bombardment in the attack of July\r\n31.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest, in the course of which it was reorganized, it spent\r\nseveral weeks in the sector of Itancourt, in the vicinity of St.\r\nQuentin. During the months of August and September it received 2,300 men\r\nas replacements. A large number came from the Russian front (244th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment, 350th Landwehr Regiment, the 19th Landsturm\r\nBattalion from the garrison of Posen; besides these, Saxons were\r\nwithdrawn from the 428th Infantry Regiment and the 8th Landsturm).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. On October 12 the 40th Division was transferred to Flanders for a\r\nsecond time. From October 17 to 27 it occupied the sector of Langewaade-\r\nZevecoten, northeast of Bixschoote, and there underwent the attack of\r\nOctober 27, which again caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n6. The division was then sent to Russia, where it arrived at the end of\r\nNovember. It was there assigned to the 10th Army and took up its\r\nposition south of Smorgoni, where it still was at the beginning of\r\nJanuary, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 40th Division is purely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the division has generally been passive (especially\r\nduring the attack of July 31, 1917, north of Ypres).\r\n\r\nIn the 104th Infantry Regiment (July 22–28) the men scattered under\r\nfire, sometimes with their noncommissioned officers, and fled to a\r\ndistance of 8 kilometers behind the front.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened for the period October 17–27. In the 134th\r\nInfantry Regiment, which was considered the best regiment of the\r\ndivision, one-half of the 6th Company left the front line on October 24.\r\n\r\nOnly the assault detachment offered any energetic resistance on October\r\n27, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 40th Division was identified in the region of Lake Narotch-Niemen\r\nfor the last time on the 15th of January. It then went into reserve in\r\nthe vicinity of Vilna.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. The division was not identified between the 4th of February, when it\r\nwas stated as being “on the Eastern front,” and the 20th of March, when\r\nit was in Lorraine. It very probably came from the East about the end of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. On April 15 it relieved the 4th Bavarian Division near Regnieville\r\n(west of Pont à Mousson). During this time whenever units were out of\r\nline they were intensively trained. It was withdrawn on June 1, its\r\nplace being taken by the 183d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division entrained at Jaulny the following day and traveled via\r\nRembercourt-Waville-Onville-Chambley-Mars la Tour-Jarny-Conflans-\r\nMontmedy-Sedan-Mézières-Rethel, detraining at Asfeld la Ville on the 3d.\r\nOn the 16th it relieved the 2d Guard Division near Troësnes. This sector\r\nwas a quiet one until the beginning of the Allied counteroffensive of\r\nJuly 18. The 40th Division was caught in this drive and was driven\r\nnorthward. On the 24th it was relieved by the Bavarian Ersatz Division\r\nand went to rest near Oisy le Verger (northwest of Cambrai).\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n5. On the 22d of August the division entered line near Courcelles le\r\nComte (south of Arras), counterattacking the same day. It was withdrawn\r\non the 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n6. After a short rest near Roubaix, it relieved the 236th Division\r\nsoutheast of Ypres on September 10. After losing nearly 1,300 prisoners,\r\nthe division was withdrawn from line near Wervicq, October 8, and went\r\nto the Courtrai area, where it rested six days.\r\n\r\n7. On the 15th it reenforced the front near Gulleghem (northeast of\r\nMenin). It was withdrawn from line in the Vichte sector (east of\r\nCourtrai), about the 26th.\r\n\r\n8. On November 8 the division returned to line near Avelghem (northeast\r\nof Roubaix), and was still in line on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nUntil 1918 the 40th (Saxon) Division had been considered as being a\r\nsecond-class unit. It was soon noticed that practically all Saxon troops\r\nwere not fighting as well as before, and this was particularly true of\r\nthe 40th Division, for although its men were young and the number of\r\neffectives high, it was used in none of the German offensives.

At the beginning of hostilities the 41st Division was engaged against\r\nRussia, first in East Prussia, then in Poland, beginning with October.\r\nIt was at Lodz at the beginning of December, at Skiernewice on the 20th,\r\nand fought on the Rawka in January, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In February, 1915, transferred north of the Vistula, it operated\r\nuntil summer between Prasnysz and the valley of Bobr-Narew. From there\r\nit was taken to the northern frontier of East Prussia in July and\r\nadvanced as far as Mitau, from there to Jakobstadt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. Until October, 1916, the division occupied the same sector on the\r\nDvina, between Friedrichstadt and Jakobstadt. It underwent a Russian\r\noffensive in March, 1916, and took part in an attack on May 10. In these\r\ntwo actions it suffered serious losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n2. On October 21, the 41st Division, destined to take part in the\r\nRoumanian campaign, entrained southeast of Friedrichstadt, traveled by\r\nway of Mitau, Grodno, Warsaw, Oppeln, Budapest, Temesvar, and detrained\r\non November 5 at Pay, south of Hatszeg. It went into action in the\r\nvicinity of Jiu and advanced almost without fighting. It entered\r\nBucarest on December 6. On the 7th it again took up the pursuit of the\r\nRoumanians. On reaching the Sereth the 41st Division encountered the\r\nRussians. It remained in line until February 8, 1917. The losses of the\r\ndivision, slight in the battles with the Roumanians, were greater in the\r\nRussian attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. Between February 8 and February 15 the 41st Division entrained at\r\nZilibia for the Western Front. (Itinerary: Bucarest-Salzburg-Munich-Ulm-\r\nAugsburg-Thionville.) It detrained in Lorraine (Arsweiler, Ruxweiler,\r\nAudun le Roman) on February 20.\r\n\r\n2. After a month of rest and training in Lorraine, during which it was\r\nreorganized (the 148th Infantry Regiment received 600 men as\r\nreplacements), the division went into line, at the beginning of May, at\r\nBois le Prêtre.\r\n\r\n3. Between May 6 and May 9 it was transferred by way of Sedan to Rethel,\r\nfrom which place it marched to the vicinity of Sissonne.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n4. Sent into line in the sector of Hurtebise for a very short stay (May\r\n25–26 to May 28–29), it went into action on the 21st in the vicinity of\r\nChevreux. It took part there in the attack of June 3 upon Californie\r\nPlateau, in the course of which its losses were serious (50 to 60 men\r\nper company in the 152d Regiment, heavy losses in the 148th Infantry\r\nRegiment).\r\n\r\n5. The 42d Division remained in the sector of Chevreux until June 25.\r\nAbout July 3 it went to the east of the Butte du Mesnil. It remained in\r\nthis sector, without any notable occurrences, until the beginning of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. On November 12 it was in the vicinity of Staden, Houthulst wood,\r\nwhere it alternated with the 38th Division. Relieved on January 14,\r\n1918, it went to rest near Bruges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 41st Division is recruited principally from West Prussia. As the\r\nregion is not very large and has a relatively small population, the 41st\r\nDivision borrows from other districts (especially the 6th Corps\r\nDistrict). It contained a large number of Alsace-Lorrainers during its\r\nstay on the Russian front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 41st Division, coming from the Russo-Roumanian front, where it had\r\nremained until the beginning of February, 1917, appears to have only a\r\nmediocre military value.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the attack of June 3, 1917, on the Californie Plateau,\r\nthe retreat of the 148th Infantry Regiment was carried out in a state of\r\nextreme confusion.\r\n\r\nDuring its stay on the Champagne front the 41st Division showed no\r\noffensive activity. (July 3-November, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The 41st Division was relieved in the sector north of Ypres by the\r\n38th Division toward the end of January, and went to rest near Bruges.\r\nWhile here the artillery received new guns, and it seems probable that\r\nthe division was put through a course of training.\r\n\r\n2. During the night of February 25–26 the division relieved the 2d Guard\r\nReserve Division south of Westroosebeke (northeast of Ypres). About the\r\n4th of March it was relieved by the 38th Division and went to rest in\r\nthe Turcoing area.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n3. On the 26th of March the division was identified near Oppy (northeast\r\nof Arras). Here it was heavily engaged, and the attack which it\r\nattempted broke down through heavy casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n4. The division was identified in the same area on the 28th, but not\r\nafterwards, and so it was very likely withdrawn during the next day or\r\ntwo. Early in April the division moved up in support of the 21st Reserve\r\nDivision in the Beaumont-Hamel region (north of Albert), and during the\r\nnight of the 7th–8th it relieved the 1st Guard Reserve Division a little\r\nfarther to the north in the Puisieux sector (east of Hébuterne). On the\r\n14th of April the division extended its front to the south so as to\r\nrelieve the 24th Division. On the 11th of June it was relieved by the\r\n26th Reserve Division and went to rest and refit in the Douai area.\r\n\r\n5. On the 9th of July it relieved the 108th Division east of Villers-\r\nBretonneux (east of Amiens). Here it was caught in the Allied drive of\r\nAugust 8, and after losing over 1,700 prisoners was withdrawn on the\r\n10th.\r\n\r\n6. After resting a fortnight immediately behind the front, it came back\r\ninto line near Cappy (southeast of Bray) on the 25th. In the fighting\r\nthat followed the division lost more than 800 prisoners, and even more\r\nkilled and wounded. It was relieved early in September and went to rest\r\nand to be reconstituted near Château Salins (northeast of Nancy). On\r\nSeptember 8 it received as a draft what was left of the dissolved 18th\r\nReserve Regiment (225th Division disbanded).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. Leaving Metz on October 6 and traveling via St. Juvin, the division\r\nreenforced the front near Sommerance (east of Grandpré) on the 9th to\r\nmeet the American push of the 8th. It was withdrawn on the 31st after\r\nhaving suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n8. It rested a day or two immediately in rear of the front, and on the\r\n3d it was thrown in near Nouart (southwest of Stenay), the Americans\r\nhaving attacked again on the 1st. It was again withdrawn on the 8th, and\r\ndid not come back into line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 41st has been considered a second-class division. With the exception\r\nof its engagements in the spring near Albert and in the Argonne in\r\nOctober and November, it has not done a great deal of fighting during\r\nthe year; during this fighting, however, it suffered very severely, so\r\nthat when it was withdrawn on the 8th of November its companies did not\r\nhave an average combatant strength of 25. On June 6 the commanding\r\ngeneral issued an order indicating an increase in the number of\r\ninstances in which subordinates emphatically refused to accompany their\r\nunits into line and in which officers neglected to enforce obedience to\r\norders, and insisting that the evil be remedied even though the men had\r\nto be shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             42d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │59.      │97.      │59.      │97.      │65.      │17.\r\n              │         │138.     │         │138.     │         │131.\r\n              │65.      │17.      │65.      │17.      │         │138.\r\n              │         │131.     │         │131.     │         │\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │7 Uhlan Rgt.       │1 Sqn. 7 Uhlan Rgt.│1 Sqn. 7 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │42 Brig.:          │42 Brig.:          │42 Brig.:\r\n              │8 F.

Upon mobilization, the 42d Division and the 31st Division formed the\r\n21st Army Corps.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the 6th Army (Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria), and fought,\r\nat the beginning of August, 1914, across the Lorraine frontier, in the\r\nvicinity of Château Salins, Dieuze, Rechicourt (Aug. 5–12). Engaged on\r\nthe 20th northeast of Dieuze, the 42d Division reached Lunéville on the\r\n22d and attacked Rehainviller and Gerbeviller on the 24th. These days\r\nhad been very costly. On August 26 the 121st Infantry Regiment was\r\nreduced to 31 officers and 1,562 men. (Official Document.)\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of September it was sent to reenforce the 2d\r\nBavarian Corps. On September 3 it was in the vicinity of Moyen-Domptail.\r\nIt retired to Dieuze (Sept. 11–13) and entrained at Boulay on the 18th,\r\nfor Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. On September 24 it was on the Somme. It fought at Gruny, Maucourt, in\r\nthe vicinity of Chaulnes-Pressoire (end of September to beginning of\r\nOctober). It took up its position on the Chaulnes front, along the road\r\nfrom Amiens to St. Quentin (November-December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The 42d Division occupied the lines north of Chaulnes until the end\r\nof January, 1915. On December 26, the losses of the 131st Infantry\r\nRegiment since the beginning of the campaign amounted to 87 officers and\r\n3,233 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n2. About January 25 the 42d Division was relieved and entrained for the\r\nEastern Front with the 31st Division (21st Army Corps).\r\n\r\n3. Concentrated in East Prussia at the beginning of February, it formed\r\na part of the Hindenburg Army which was to force the Russians across the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n4. From the vicinity of Augustowo (Feb. 14) it advanced rapidly to the\r\neast; it reached Sopockin on the 20th, and took up its position with the\r\n21st Army Corps on the line Sopockin-Chtabine (north of Grodno). On\r\nMarch 9 the violent Russian counterattacks caused it heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIAMPOL.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of March the 42d Division bore to the north; it was\r\nat Kalwarjia on March 26; occupied the vicinity of Mariampol on April 2.\r\nIt fought in this sector from March 29 to April 24 and remained there\r\nuntil August. (On Apr. 13 the losses of the first two battalions of the\r\n131st Infantry Regiment since the 6th of February had been 1,672 men,\r\naccording to the Official Casualty List. The 7th Company had only 65 men\r\nleft on Apr. 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVILNA.\r\n\r\n6. Renewing its forward march, the division reached Vilna on August 30;\r\ncontinuing toward the east, it reached Herviaty-Vorniany on September\r\n20, then went toward Lake Narotch, vicinity of Postavy, where the front\r\nbecame stable.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn the 97th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 108th\r\nDivision, a new formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE NAROTCH.\r\n\r\n1. The 42d Division held its positions at Lake Narotch until April,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of March, 1916, it sustained the Russian attacks and\r\nsuffered great losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. On April 24, 1917, the 42d Division was relieved from the sector of\r\nLake Narotch and entrained at Vilna for the Western Front. The activity\r\nalong the Galician front caused its itinerary to be modified, and from\r\nWarsaw it was sent to Lemberg. In reserve first, it went into action on\r\nJuly 20 in the German counteroffensive of Brzezany, which took it to the\r\nregion south of Tarnopol (Grjimalov, July 31).\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGA.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the Galician front at the beginning of August, it\r\nentrained at Lemberg on the 24th, and was transferred to Neugut (between\r\nMitau and Jakobstadt) on August 27. It took part in the advance to Riga;\r\none of its regiments crossed the Dvina, in the vicinity of Uxkull, on\r\nSeptember 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nOESEL ISLAND.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September it was sent to Libau, where important forces\r\nwere being concentrated for the occupation of the islands in the Baltic.\r\nOn October 12 the 131st Infantry Regiment landed on the Oesel Island,\r\nwhich it occupied until November 1. The 138th Infantry Regiment remained\r\nat Moon until October 25. At the beginning of November the 42d Division\r\nwas transferred to the vicinity of Kovel. At the end of November it took\r\nover a calm sector in the vicinity of Kachovka.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. Entraining at Kovel on December 23, it arrived in France on December\r\n28. (Itinerary: Warsaw-Thorn-Posen-Leipzig-Dortmund-Cologne-Herbestal-\r\nBrussels. It detrained at Ascq on the 28th.)\r\n\r\n5. After a stay in the vicinity of Lille, it relieved the 4th Division\r\neast of Armentières on January 23, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nAs the regional system of recruiting could not furnish dependable\r\nelements, the 42d Division is principally recruited from Westphalia and\r\nthe Rhine Province. The Alsace-Lorrainers were fairly numerous, however,\r\nduring the stay of the division on the Russian front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 42d Division occupied the Eastern Front from February, 1915, until\r\nthe end of December, 1917.\r\n\r\nIn the offensive operations in which the 42d Division took part in 1917\r\nthe successes appear to have been fairly easy. The greater part of the\r\ntime it has not had to sustain any serious action and its losses have\r\nbeen comparatively slight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Armentieres sector until it was relieved about\r\nMarch 22 by the 32d Division. On April 9 it reenforced the battle front\r\nnear Merris. It was engaged in heavy fighting, and between April 9 and\r\n16 the losses of the division amounted to 50 per cent of the strength.\r\nOn April 17 it was relieved by the 12th Division.\r\n\r\n2. The division came in on the quiet Lens sector on April 25–26,\r\nrelieving the 220th Division. It held the sector until June 25, when it\r\nwas relieved by the 36th Reserve Division and moved to the region\r\nsouthwest of Soissons, where on June 30 it relieved the 14th Division.\r\nIt suffered from the French attack of July 18, losing 1,400 prisoners.\r\nIt was withdrawn about July 22.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested nearly a month undergoing reconstitution by\r\nelements from the dissolved 211th Division. The 390th Regiment was\r\ncompletely merged with the 42d Division. From Laon the division moved to\r\nRethel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. From its entry into the Champagne line on August 22 in relief of the\r\n28th Division until October 1 it was engaged in resisting the French\r\noffensive operations in Champagne, during which period it lost about\r\n2,000 prisoners. The division was withdrawn on October 1. After two\r\nweeks in the second line the division returned to line about October 14\r\nnear Olizy. It continued in line until the armistice. After November 3\r\nthe division was opposite the left flank of the American front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was used as an attack division\r\nin the Lys offensive, but thereafter was employed solely on the\r\ndefensive. The division had a good composition with a large percentage\r\nof men of the younger classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         43d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │85 Res.  │201 Res. │85 Res.  │201 Res. │85 Res.  │201 Res.\r\n              │         │202 Res. │         │202 Res. │         │202 Res.\r\n              │86 Res.  │203 Res. │86 Res.  │203 Res. │86 Res.  │203 Res.\r\n              │         │204 Res. │         │204 Res. │         │204 Res.\r\n              │ 15 Res.

The 43d Reserve Division (first series of reserve divisions engaged\r\nin October, 1914) formed at this time, with the 44th Reserve Division,\r\nthe 22d Reserve Corps. It was formed from the regimental recruit depots\r\nof the guard, and has preserved from that time a selective system of\r\nrecruiting from the whole of the Prussian territory.\r\n\r\n2. Going into training at the camp of Doeberitz at the beginning of\r\nSeptember, the 43d Reserve Division entrained on October 13 for Belgium,\r\nand on the 19th it began fighting in the vicinity of Dixmude, Merckem,\r\nBixschoote, etc. It was in action there until the end of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nYSER.\r\n\r\n3. After the battle of the Yser the elements of the division occupied\r\ndifferent parts of the front between Ypres and Nieuport.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1915, the 86th Reserve Brigade was in\r\nline at Westende.\r\n\r\n2. About the end of February the 43d Reserve Division was reconcentrated\r\nand then sent to rest in the vicinity of Menin-Roulers until April 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. In May elements of the division were holding the sector Bixschoote-\r\nBoesinghe (North of the Ypres salient). Another part of the division was\r\nsent as a reenforcement north of Arras (Souchez) to oppose the French\r\noffensive. The 202d Reserve Infantry Regiment lost 76 officers and 1,320\r\nmen at Notre Dame de Lorette (Official List of Casualties).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. About the beginning of July the 86th Reserve Brigade was transferred\r\nto Russia and took part in the offensive of Mackensen in Poland. Between\r\nMay 15 and September 29 the 204th Reserve Infantry Regiment listed as\r\ncasualties 63 officers and 3,511 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE-SERBIA.\r\n\r\n5. The 85th Reserve Brigade, sent to Lorraine (Xivray), then to Woevre\r\n(July to September), took part in the battle of Champagne (end of\r\nSeptember), and then rejoined the rest of the division in Serbia, where\r\nthe 43d Reserve Division took part in the campaign in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. The division left Serbia to return to France at the end of January\r\nand beginning of February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. After a rest in the vicinity of Valenciennes (February-March) it was\r\nsent to the Verdun front at the end of March, and went into action west\r\nof the Meuse on April 10 (attacks of Bethincourt and the Mort Homme),\r\nwhere it suffered heavy losses between April 10 and May 25. The 12th\r\nCompany of the 201st Reserve Infantry Regiment received not less than\r\n185 men as replacements during the month of May. (Document.)\r\n\r\n3. Toward the end of May the 43d Reserve Division was withdrawn from the\r\nfront and sent to rest in the Thionville area. At Verdun it had lost 50\r\nper cent of its infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the middle of June it entrained at Novion Porcien and was again\r\nsent to Russia. Itinerary: Charleville-Trèves-Cassel-Leipzig-Dresden-\r\nBreslau-Cracow-Lemberg-Stojanow (southwest of Sokal.) The 204th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment detrained on June 19.\r\n\r\n5. On the Russian front the division was engaged west of Loutsk in the\r\nGerman counteroffensive in June. (Its losses may be estimated from the\r\nfact that the 12th Company of the 201st Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\nreceived replacements of 152 men in July and August, the 3d Company at\r\nleast 145 men from July 9 to 29.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n6. On November 15 the division was brought back to the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary Oderberg-Leipzig-Frankfort-Mayence-Thionville-Sedan-\r\nThourout.) Reduced to three regiments by the assignment of the 204th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment to the 218th Division, a new formation, it was\r\nat rest for almost a month in the vicinity of Rethel.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n7. In consequence of the French attack of December 15 north of Verdun,\r\nthe division was concentrated in the vicinity of Azannes. On December 17\r\nit relieved the remnants of the 10th Division in the Chambrettes sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 43d Reserve Division remained at Verdun until January 31, 1917,\r\nwithout being engaged in any important action. However, it suffered\r\nrather heavy losses there.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. After a rest in Alsace, the division was sent to Champagne, where, on\r\nFebruary 22, it reenforced the front between Loivre and east of the\r\nCavaliers du Courcy. The French attack of April 16 caused it serious\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the end of April, and reorganized, it went back into line\r\nin the calm sector of Vauquois about May 9; the 12th Company of the\r\n201st Reserve Infantry Regiment was filled up by the arrival of 100 men\r\n(1918 class; men from the 613th and 614th dissolved Infantry Regiments).\r\n\r\n4. At the end of May the division was withdrawn from the Argonne. It was\r\nrested and reorganized first in the Ardennes, then in the vicinity of\r\nLaon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n5. From July 18 to 20, it went into the sector Panthéon-Épine du\r\nChevregny (south of Pargny-Filain) and almost at once underwent the\r\nartillery preparation and the French attack of July 30 which caused it\r\nheavy losses, increased by the counterattacks which it attempted on July\r\n31 and August 10. On July 30 the 12th Company of the 202d Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment had only 5 noncommissioned officers and 56 men left\r\n(document). On August 10 the 201st Reserve Infantry Regiment was almost\r\ncompletely destroyed and left 124 men as prisoners south of La Royère.\r\n\r\n6. The 43d Reserve Division was relieved from the Chemin des Dames on\r\nAugust 23 and sent to rest until the end of September in the vicinity of\r\nLaon. It was filled up and reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA MALMAISON.\r\n\r\n7. Receiving training at the beginning of October in view of an\r\noffensive which was to anticipate the expected French attack, the\r\nelements of the 43d Reserve Division were engaged, beginning with\r\nOctober 15, to reenforce weakened divisions at Vaudesson, La Malmaison,\r\nand Bruyeres. They underwent the attack of October 23, which caused them\r\nheavy losses (53 officers, 2,190 men, prisoners). The remnants of the\r\ndivision were relieved on the Ailette on October 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n8. The division was sent to Russia soon afterwards, where it detrained\r\non November 11, in the vicinity of Baranovitchi, after five days’\r\ntravel. It then relieved the 201st Division, scheduled to go to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 43d Reserve Division was recruited, as was the guard in which it had\r\nits origin, from the whole of the Prussian territory. The trained men\r\n(returned, wounded, and sick), who figure in the reenforcements which it\r\nreceived, had the same origin (Guard, 1st Reserve Guard Division, 261st\r\nand 262d Reserve Guard Ersatz Divisions, Guard Landsturm Battalions,\r\netc.). In April, 1917, the division absorbed a part of the 613th and\r\n614th Regiments formed from the Guard recruit depots and dissolved on\r\nMarch 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 43d Reserve Division has always been considered a very good\r\norganization (December, 1917).\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1917, south of La Royère, the 201st Ersatz Regiment\r\nattacked “with very great energy.”\r\n\r\nIn October, 1917, at La Malmaison, the 43d Reserve Division was brought\r\nup for reenforcement as an attacking division.\r\n\r\nBecause of its recent losses (in the attack of Oct. 3) the 43d Reserve\r\nDivision needs to be completely reorganized before going into action\r\n(December, 1917).\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that all the recruits of the division come from the\r\nGuard recruit depots. (After the losses suffered on Apr. 16, 1917, the\r\ndivision received 3,000 men from the depots of Brandenburg.)\r\n\r\nThe human material at the disposition of the division is of high\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division left Russia on February 9 and arrived at the Camp Alten-\r\nGrabon near Magdeburg about the middle of February. After resting there\r\nabout five weeks the division entrained on March 18 and traveled via\r\nBielefeld-Gladbach-Aachen-Visé—Hasselt-Louvain-Brussels-Denderleeuw-\r\nAudenarde-Courtrai-Tourcoing to Lille, where the regiment detrained on\r\nthe 22d, billeting at Loos. On the night of April 1–2 the 202d Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment marched via Emmerin and Wattignies to Herrin,\r\ncontinuing on the night of April 2–3 via Chemy-Camphin-Ostricourt to\r\nMalmaison and thence to Herrin-Lietard. On April 4 the regiment\r\nproceeded to Noyelles-Godault, on the 5th back to Malmaison, and thence\r\non the 7th to Billy Berclau.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE CANAL.\r\n\r\n2. The division was engaged at Festubert on April 9. The objective of\r\nthe division was to break through the enemy’s positions, force the\r\npassage of the Lawe and the La Bassee Canals, and capture the heights of\r\nHinges and the town of Bethum. It was held up by British resistance at\r\nFestubert and did not penetrate farther. On April 29 it was relieved by\r\nthe 9th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. After its relief, the division rested in the area south of Lille\r\nuntil June 24, when it relieved the 24th Reserve Division at\r\nBouzencourt. Until August 8, it held the sector on the Somme. In the\r\nfighting in August, the division lost 600 prisoners. On August 20 it\r\nreturned to line at Bray and was engaged until the end of the month. The\r\ntotal number of prisoners lost by the division in these two engagements\r\nwas 1,100.\r\n\r\n4. Early in September the division was broken up. The 203d Reserve\r\nRegiment was turned into the Guard Ersatz Division, the 202d Reserve\r\nRegiment to the 2d Guard Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its complete failure on the La\r\nBassee attack in April and its subsequently long retention in line on\r\nthe Somme prepared the way for its dissolution about the first of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         44th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │87 Res.  │205 Res. │87 Res.  │205 Res. │87 Res.  │205 Res.\r\n              │         │206 Res. │         │206 Res. │         │206 Res.\r\n              │88 Res.  │207 Res. │88 Res.  │207 Res. │88 Res.  │207 Res.\r\n              │         │208 Res. │         │208 Res. │         │208 Res.\r\n              │ 16 Res.

The 44th Reserve Division, formed between August and October, 1914,\r\nlike the other division of the 22d Reserve Corps (43d Reserve Division),\r\nwas trained at Jueterbog Camp and entrained on October 12. Detraining at\r\nTermonde, it was in action at Dixmude and at Bixschoote in October and\r\nNovember and lost very heavily. On November 9 the 3d Battalion of the\r\n205th Reserve Infantry Regiment was reduced to 153 men. (Notebook.)\r\n\r\n2. After the battle of the Yser, it occupied several sectors north of\r\nYpres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIEUPORT.\r\n\r\n1. The 44th Reserve Division remained on the Flanders front until the\r\nmonth of June, 1915.\r\n\r\n2. On June 7 the division was relieved from the Lombartzyde-Nieuport\r\nsector and transferred to the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. Arriving in Russia in the middle of June, it took part in the\r\nMackensen offensive—battles of pursuit on the Galician frontier (June\r\n22-July 16); battle of Krasnostaw (July 19–28) and of Biskupice (July,\r\n29–30); battles up to the Bug (July 31 to Aug. 19); taking of Brest-\r\nLitovsk on August 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n4. In October it was sent to Serbia and went through the entire\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of December, it was sent to rest in Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1916, the 44th Reserve Division entrained for\r\nFrance. (Itinerary: Inddis-Budapest-Vienna-Rosenheim-Cologne-Charleroi.)\r\nIt detrained at Landrecies-Valenciennes on February 6. It did some work\r\non the Somme front (the 306th Reserve Infantry Regiment near Peronne;\r\nthe 208th Reserve Infantry Regiment remained at Mesle until Mar. 14) and\r\nthen entrained at Landrecies on March 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN (MORT-HOMME).\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated in the vicinity of Buzancy, at the end of March, the\r\ndivision went to the left bank of the Meuse. On April 11 the 86th\r\nReserve Brigade went into line in the Mort-Homme sector. The 44th\r\nReserve Division was in action beginning with April 25, and suffered\r\nvery heavy losses (April-May).\r\n\r\n3. On June 5 the 44th Reserve Division was withdrawn from the front,\r\nreorganized, and sent to rest in the vicinity of Sedan (replacements\r\nfrom the 3d and 5th Corps Districts).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Transferred to the Somme (July 2 and 3), the division sent some of\r\nits elements into action on the Estrees-Belloy front on July 4. It\r\nunderwent the French attacks between these two villages (July 6–10) and\r\nlaunched a violent counterattack on the 7th and 8th. These engagements\r\ncaused it severe losses (9 officers and 522 men as prisoners).\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved on July 10, it spent a few days at rest, and on July 20\r\nentered the line in the sector of Lassigny-Beuvraignes.\r\n\r\nBetween June 1 and July 15 the 205th Reserve Infantry Regiment, after it\r\nhad received men from the Beverloo depot, had received at least 145 men\r\nfor its 5th Company, 167 for its 8th; on July 14 the 1st Company of the\r\n206th Infantry Regiment received at least 128 men; some (1917 class) had\r\nonly been in the service since May 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n6. Sent to rest in the middle of September, the 44th Reserve Division\r\nagain went into action on the Somme (Berny en Santerre-Genermont),\r\nbetween October 9 and October 28, and again lost very heavily.\r\n\r\n7. It then came back into the Lassigny sector, where it was reorganized\r\n(reinforcements of 300 to 400 men per regiment). It transferred the\r\n207th Reserve Infantry Regiment to the 228th Division, a new\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY (RETREAT).\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1917, the 44th Reserve Division took part in the German\r\nretreat and left the lines at Lassigny to take up its position between\r\nLa Fère and Moy (Mar. 25).\r\n\r\n\r\nLA MALMAISON (WOËVRE).\r\n\r\n2. Sent into the reserve of the army at the end of March in the vicinity\r\nof Marle St. Gobert, the division was concentrated on April 15 in the\r\nvicinity of Monampteuil-Filain (Apr. 20). On the 21st, on both banks of\r\nthe Oise-Aisne Canal, it relieved the remnants of the division decimated\r\nby the French offensive of April 16 and at La Malmaison received the new\r\nattack of May 5. Very much exhausted (1,670 prisoners), it was replaced\r\nat once (night of May 5–6) and transferred to the Woëvre first and then\r\nto the Côtes de Meuse northeast of St. Mihiel, where the division took\r\nover the sector of Chevaliers after being reorganized. It was withdrawn\r\nOctober 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. On November 10 it went into line in Flanders, north of Passchendaele.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\nRelieved at the end of the month, it was sent to the sector of Neuve\r\nChapelle. It was still there March 19, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 44th Reserve Division was mixed at the time of its formation (one\r\nregiment from Hanover), but has since become purely Brandenburg by its\r\nreduction to three regiments. However, this does not prevent the\r\noccasional introduction of extraneous elements—for example, in July,\r\n1916 (urgent call for available reserve at Beverloo). The 1917 class\r\nthen made its appearance on July 12, 1916 (in the 208th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment); the 1918 class on April 13, 1917 (in the 205th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 44th Reserve Division has been designated an assault division.\r\n\r\nThe 44th Reserve Division has not shown any great military value in the\r\ncourse of the battles which it went into north of the Aisne. Certain\r\nelements, however, fought well. One must note that the combat effectives\r\nof the division were very much reduced by the artillery preparation\r\nbefore the attack of May 5, 1917.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of the Aisne, the division made up for its losses with\r\nelements from the field recruit depots and two replacements, one coming\r\nfrom Warsaw (1917 class), and the other from the 5th Corps District\r\n(mostly returned wounded).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE CANAL.\r\n\r\n1. About April 1st, the division was retired to the second line, from\r\nwhich it returned on the night of April 12–13 to attack near Locon on\r\nthe 13th. It held a sector in that region until its relief by the 220th\r\nDivision on May 6–7.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested at Courrieres for three weeks. On May 26 it\r\nrelieved the 39th Division west of Vieux Berqum. Here it remained until\r\nJuly 4, when it was relieved by the 207th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division moved to the area northwest of Tournai early in July.\r\nThere it rested and received drafts until its return to line northeast\r\nof Martinpuich on August 26. The division fell back on Flers (27th),\r\nBeaulencourt (1st), Villers au Flos (2d), Ruyaulcourt (3d), southwest of\r\nHavrincourt (7th). It was withdrawn from line on September 10 after\r\nlosing 700 prisoners.\r\n\r\n4. It was out of line for four weeks and unconfirmed reports indicated\r\nits presence at Metz. However, it again appeared in line on the Cambrai-\r\nSt. Quentin front on October 10, north of Montay. It fought around Le\r\nCateau until the end of the month when it was withdrawn from line north\r\nof Robersart. About the fourth of November the division was back in line\r\nat Locquignol and in the closing days of the war it fell back to\r\nMaubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as first class. It was not used in any of the\r\nmajor offensives of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        44th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1916             │            1917\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │Rosenberg.    │93 Ldw.       │44 Ldw.       │81 Ldw.\r\n              │              │382 Ldw.      │              │93 Ldw.\r\n              │              │              │              │382 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │                             │Art.

The 44th Landwehr Division was formed in April, 1917, by the grouping\r\nof the 44th Landwehr Brigade (93d and 382d Landwehr Regiments) and the\r\n81st Landwehr Regiment. The latter regiment had been successively\r\nattached to the 39th Reserve Division (area of St. Dié until the spring\r\nof 1916), to the Bavarian Ersatz Division (near Verdun until the end of\r\n1916) and finally to the 54th Division (Flirey).\r\n\r\n2. The 44th Landwehr Brigade, called the Rosenberg Brigade until July,\r\n1916, united in December, 1915, on the left bank of the Moselle, the 1st\r\nLandwehr Ersatz Regiment, afterwards the 382d Landwehr Regiment\r\n(formerly attached to the Norroy Brigade) and the 93d Landwehr, former\r\nVon Gundlach Regiment of the Graudenz Corps, formed from two of the six\r\nsurplus Landwehr battalions of the 4th Corps District and of the 38th\r\nLandwehr Brigade Ersatz Battalion (Hanover), identified Jeandelize in\r\nJune, 1915. It was attached to the 8th Ersatz Division at the beginning\r\nof 1916.\r\n\r\n3. The 44th Landwehr Brigade held the Moselle front on the left bank of\r\nthe river until it was transformed into the 44th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIS LE PRÊTRE.\r\n\r\n1. The formation of the 44th Landwehr Division in April, 1917, had no\r\neffect upon the position of the elements which entered into its\r\ncomposition. They continued to hold the left bank of the Moselle (Bois\r\nle Prêtre) until October, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. In this sector the 44th Landwehr Division gave signs of its presence\r\nonly by a few unimportant raids.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER ALSACE.\r\n\r\n3. On October 13, 1917, the 44th Landwehr Division was relieved from\r\nBois le Prêtre, entrained on the 16th at Arnaville, Pagny, Bayonville,\r\nand was transferred to Alsace, detraining at Sierentz and Bartenheim.\r\nDuring the night of the 18th–19th it went into line on both banks of the\r\nRhône-Rhine Canal.\r\n\r\nOn November 7 the division suffered some losses at Schoenholz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nComposed for the most part of elderly men accustomed to holding calm\r\nsectors, the 44th Landwehr Division is the antithesis of an attack\r\ndivision. However, it knows how to organize and maintain a position and\r\nthere is reason to believe that it would do well on the defensive.\r\n\r\nEach of its regiments possesses an assault troop.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Altkirch sector throughout 1918 until the\r\narmistice. The sector remained absolutely quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         45th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │89 Res.  │209 Res. │89 Res.  │209 Res. │89 Res.  │209 Res.\r\n              │         │212 Res. │         │212 Res. │         │212 Res.\r\n              │90 Res.  │210 Res. │90 Res.  │210 Res. │90 Res.  │210 Res.\r\n              │         │211 Res. │         │211 Res. │         │211 Res.\r\n              │ 17 Res.

The 45th Reserve Division (forming the 23d Reserve Corps with the\r\n46th Reserve Division) belongs to the series of divisions formed between\r\nAugust and October, 1914. It received its training at the Jueterbog\r\nCamp, entrained on October 12, and detrained at Alost in Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\nYSER.\r\n\r\n2. On October 21, 1914, the 45th Reserve Division was engaged in the\r\nbattle of the Yser in the vicinity of Noordschoote-Steenstraat, and\r\nsuffered serious losses in the course of the battles, which were\r\nprolonged until November (from Oct. 15 to Nov. 11 52 officers and 1,669\r\nmen in the 212th Reserve Infantry Regiment, according to the Official\r\nList of Casualties).\r\n\r\n3. In December elements of the division were in line in the vicinity of\r\nBixschoote.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in Belgium and in the vicinity of Armentières\r\nduring the entire year of 1915 and the first half of 1916.\r\n\r\n2. On April 22, 1915, it attacked in the Steenstraat sector and occupied\r\nthe village of Lizerne, which counter attacks obliged it to abandon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The 45th Reserve Division continued to occupy the zone north of Ypres\r\n(Steenstraat-Boesinghe) until March 3, 1916. The 209th and 212th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiments were temporarily detached (from the end of January to\r\nthe beginning of March) and assigned to the 26th Division in the\r\nBecelaere sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSINES.\r\n\r\n2. On March 12 the division took over the sector of Messines, south of\r\nYpres. Until the month of September it did not take part in any\r\nimportant action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of September it was withdrawn from Flanders, sent to\r\nthe Somme, and engaged in the sector of Thiepval-Martinpuich (Sept. 9 to\r\n24). On September 15 it withstood the British attack between Courcelette\r\nand Thiepval, where it lost very heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n4. After a short rest in the vicinity of Bapaume the division was sent\r\nto the Noyon area. It transferred the 209th Reserve Infantry Regiment to\r\nthe 207th Division, a new formation. At the beginning of October it went\r\ninto line on the left bank of the Oise at Tracy le Val. In the interval,\r\nin order to fill up its regiments, it had to borrow from the Landsturm\r\nbattalions of the 2d Corps District (men of the Landsturm 2d Btn.,\r\ntrained and untrained from the classes 1892 to 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. January 22, 1917, the 45th Reserve Division left the sector of Tracy\r\nle Val for the Sissonne Camp, and received training there for three\r\nweeks. Its regiments had been practically re-formed. Between September\r\n24, 1916, and February 21, 1917, the 210th Reserve Infantry Regiment had\r\nreceived 79 noncommissioned officers and 1,522 men.\r\n\r\n2. On February 12 it went into the sector Osly-Courtil-Chevillecourt,\r\nwest of Soissons. In March it retired in the direction of Coucy le\r\nChâteau; it was put in reserve (Mar. 20 to Apr. 10) in the area north of\r\nLaon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE-CHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n3. On April 10, in anticipation of the French attack, the elements of\r\nthe division were concentrated near Filain. On the 7th the 210th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was in action south of the Ailette Canal (east of\r\nVauxaillon). The other regiments were sent west of the Oise-Aisne Canal\r\ntoward Braye en Laonnois. All the units underwent the attack of April\r\n16, and were relieved between April 20 and 22, having suffered very\r\nheavy losses.\r\n\r\n4. Concentrated and reorganized north of Laon (Crecy sur Serre), the\r\ndivision again went into action near the Oise-Aisne Canal (Froidmont\r\nFarm-Malval Farm, on May 3). Its losses were again very severe during\r\nthe new French attack of May 5. It was withdrawn from the front on the\r\n6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to the vicinity of Conflans and reorganized, the division\r\nwent into line on the Côtes de Meuse (Calonne les Éparges) on May 27.\r\n\r\n6. After three months in the sector on the Côtes, the 45th Reserve\r\nDivision entrained at Conflans (Sept. 26) for Flanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n7. On September 22 it went into position in the Zonnebeke sector as a\r\ncounterattacking division. Elements of the division were engaged on\r\nOctober 1 (Polygon wood), on the 4th (Zonnebeke), and from the 9th to\r\nthe 12th as reinforcements on the Passchendaele front. After the British\r\nattack of October 12 the division, very much exhausted by these battles,\r\nwas relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\nTransferred to the rear of the Côtes de Meuse, sent into line on the\r\nheights northeast of St. Mihiel in November; it was sent to the vicinity\r\nof Bohain in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed at the time of its formation (1 Hanseatic Regiment), the 45th\r\nReserve Division was recruited almost entirely from Pomerania, in theory\r\nat least, after its reduction to three regiments. Like the other units\r\nrecruited from this province (4th Division), at the end of 1915 and\r\nseveral times since then, it has received a relatively large proportion\r\nof elderly men (1892 to 1894 classes, trained and untrained).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 45th Reserve Division fought well on the Somme. It put up a vigorous\r\ndefense on the Aisne in the course of its two engagements of April 16\r\nand May 6, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe Pomeranians, who formed the greater part of its effectives, have a\r\nmilitary reputation to sustain. However, according to the statements of\r\nprisoners, when the 212th Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the Verdun\r\nfront to Flanders it refused to attack on September 30, 1917. (British\r\nSummary of Information, Oct. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n1. Toward the end of January the division relieved the 36th Division\r\nnear Faye (north of St. Quentin), the latter division side slipping\r\ntoward the south. It remained here and took part in the initial attack\r\nof the Somme offensive; it was withdrawn about the 24th of March. It was\r\nnot entirely withdrawn on that date, however, for besides still having\r\nsome elements in line, the rest of the division was in close support as\r\na “follow up” division. In this fighting it lost heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. A few days later it went to rest in the Montdidier area. Early in\r\nApril it entered line near Assainvillers (east of Montdidier), where it\r\nwas identified on the 6th, and was relieved by the 206th Division on the\r\n18th, going to rest and refit in the region of Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 1st of June the division was in reserve northeast of Fère en\r\nTardenois, and on the 3d it reinforced the front near Chaudun (southwest\r\nof Soissons); it was relieved by the 23d Division and went to rest near\r\nOulchy le Château (west of Fère en Tardenois).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n4. The allied counteroffensive having started on July 18, the division\r\nwas hurried into line near Montron (east of La Ferté Milon) to meet it.\r\nHere it was heavily engaged and suffered severe losses. It was relieved\r\nby the 26th Division on July 27.\r\n\r\n5. It did not have an opportunity to rest, however, for it relieved the\r\n201st Division north of Fère en Tardenois two days later. It was\r\nrelieved on August 3, and went to rest in the Maubeuge region. It was\r\nidentified here on the 23d, but a few days afterwards, the Germans\r\nfearing an American attack in Alsace, it was dispatched to the vicinity\r\nof Muelheim, where it arrived prior to September 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division entrained on the 24th for Flanders, but was ordered to\r\ndetrain when it reached St. Morel (south of Vouziers) on the 26th and\r\nremained there until midnight. Then the 212th Reserve Regiment entered\r\nline in the Aire valley near Baulny, while the remainder of the division\r\nmoved farther to the west and entered line to the north of Fontaine en\r\nDormois (northeast of Suippes). On October 8 these elements came to the\r\neast and the division was in line as a whole northwest of Châtel\r\nChéhéry. It was withdrawn on the 25th and went to rest in Lorraine in\r\nthe vicinity of Conflans (southwest of Briey).\r\n\r\n7. On the 4th of November it came back into line near Woël (northeast of\r\nSt. Mihiel); it was still here on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 45th Reserve has been considered a second-class division. Heavily\r\nengaged on the Somme (three times), on the Aisne, against the Allied\r\ncounteroffensive, and in the battle of the Meuse-Argonne, it has done a\r\ngreat deal of heavy fighting during 1918, without, however, ever\r\nparticularly distinguishing itself. It suffered exceedingly heavy\r\nlosses. Early in September, the 212th Regiment received as a draft the\r\n397th Regiment of the disbanded 222d Division. About the 16th of October\r\nit received a very large draft of replacements among which were a\r\nconsiderable number of elements of decidedly Bolshevistic tendencies.\r\nMen deserted to the rear, to the enemy, and quite a few were punished\r\nfor insubordination to officers, and some for refusing to fight. The\r\nmorale of the whole division was very low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        45th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │45 Ldw.      │107 Ldw.     │45 Ldw.      │107 Ldw.\r\n              │             │133 Ldw.     │             │133 Ldw.\r\n              │             │350 Ldw.     │             │350 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │            (?)            │4 Sqn.

The 46th Reserve Division (belonging to the 23d Reserve Corps with\r\nthe 45th Division), formed between August and October, 1914, was trained\r\nat the Lockstedt Camp, and entrained for Belgium on October 12. It went\r\ninto action in the battle of the Yser between Dixmude and Bixschoote on\r\nOctober 21, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. After these battles, which lasted until about November 15, and in the\r\ncourse of which it suffered heavy losses, the division remained in\r\nFlanders and occupied the area of Bixschoote. On November 21 only 1\r\nofficer remained in the 3d Battalion of the 214th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment (letter); the 11th Company, which started with 253 men, had\r\nonly 90 left.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. Between April 22 and April 27, 1915, the 46th Reserve Division, which\r\nwas still holding the front north of Ypres, took part in the battles\r\nlaunched around Lizerne, Het-Sas, Steenstraat.\r\n\r\n2. During the rest of the year 1915 and until March, 1916, the 46th\r\nReserve Division (as well as the 45th Reserve Division) held the lines\r\nbetween Dixmude and Ypres, without any important action, with periods of\r\nrest in the vicinity of Bruges and Thourout.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

Relieved north of Ypres at the end of February, 1916, the 46th\r\nReserve Division was transferred to Werwicq, from which place on March\r\n14 it went to the sector of St. Eloi, near Messines.\r\n\r\n2. The division lost very heavily in this sector, at the beginning of\r\nApril. After a short period of rest it took over the same line from May\r\nto September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of September it left the area south of Ypres to go\r\nto the Somme. It went into action on September 8 between Vermandovillers\r\nand the Chaulnes railroad and suffered rather heavy losses, especially\r\nduring the French attack of September 17; the 2d Battalion of the 214th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment was almost completely destroyed (letter).\r\n\r\n4. Sent behind the front for a short time, about October 8, in the\r\nvicinity of Ham, it came back into line on October 17–20 minus the 213th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment, which was transferred to the 207th Division,\r\na new organization. It supported the attacks of the 21st, between\r\nAblaincourt and Chaulnes wood, where certain of its units lost very\r\nheavily. After launching a counterattack on the 22d the division was\r\nrelieved on October 24–25.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. In November and December the reorganized division took over the\r\nsector east of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 46th Reserve Division was at rest in Lorraine.\r\nOn January 28 it entrained at Lorquin and was transferred to the Oise,\r\nby way of Sarreburg, Thionville, Luxemburg, Namur, Maubeuge, St.\r\nQuentin, Tergnier, Chauny.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOULIN SOUS TOUVENT.\r\n\r\n2. On January 30 it went into the sector of Moulin sous Touvent-\r\nAutreches, which it left about March 18 to retire to Barisis, Folembray,\r\nand the lower Coucy wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORÊT DE ST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n3. Established in the St. Gobain sector in April and May, it was\r\nrelieved on May 20 and sent to rest in the area of Marle and Vervins. It\r\nwas reorganized there (the 216th Reserve Infantry Regiment received 500\r\nmen from the depot of the 76th Reserve Infantry Regiment at Hamburg).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n4. On June 13 the division went into line on the Chemin des Dames, took\r\npart in the German attack of June 22 at the Épine de Chevregny-Royère\r\nFarm, and in the attack of July 8 on the front Panthéon-Froidmont. In\r\nthese two actions it had heavy losses. It made up for these in part by\r\nmen taken from the 94th Division in Russia.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from the Laon front on July 24, the division was sent to\r\nrest and to be reorganized in the area of Montmédy.\r\n\r\n6. On August 12 it was transferred to Spincourt and placed in reserve on\r\nthe right bank of the Meuse during the French attack of August 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n7. Engaged on August 22 at the Fosse wood-Chaume wood, it lost heavily\r\nby the attack of August 26 and by its counterattack upon Beaumont.\r\n\r\n8. Relieved at once, it was reorganized and sent to rest in the vicinity\r\nof Sedan-Longuyon from August 26 to the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n9. The 46th Reserve Division reappeared from October 3 to November 10 in\r\nthe sector of Fosse wood-Chaume wood, where some elements launched an\r\nattack on November 9 and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n10. The division was at rest in the vicinity of Longwy from November 10\r\nto December 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n11. About December 17 it took over the sector west of Nomeny (Cheminot-\r\nEply) in Lorraine. It was still there at the beginning of April, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nComposed at the beginning of equal contingents from the 9th and 10th\r\nCorps Districts (Schleswig-Holstein, Hanseatic cities, and Mecklenburg;\r\nHanover, Brunswick, Oldenburg), the division, since its reduction to\r\nthree regiments, is filled up from the Hanseatic cities and the Grand\r\nDuchies of Mecklenburg. It has ceased, therefore, to be Prussian, a\r\nthing which has a certain practical interest in its designation in\r\ncommuniques, etc., and has not been able to develop any regional\r\nsentiment or cohesion. It is to be noted that the reinforcements of 1917\r\nhave been rather mixed (Poles, men from the 2d, 3d, and 5th Corps\r\nDistricts), partly because of their being taken from the Russian front,\r\nand, during its recent stay in Lorraine, from the neighboring depot of\r\nthe 99th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 46th Reserve Division may be considered a good division.\r\n\r\nThe attack of July 8, 1917, was carried out energetically. The assault\r\ntroops attacked with “extraordinary fury.”\r\n\r\nThe division fought bravely at Verdun in August, 1917.\r\n\r\nWeakened by battles and by an epidemic of dysentery (October-November),\r\nit was sent to Lorraine for rest and reorganization.\r\n\r\nThe division received intensive training and it would seem that in spite\r\nof new, untrained recruits it will quickly regain its value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved about April 25 in Lorraine and transferred\r\nto the Montdidier area, where it was at rest until June 10. On that day\r\nit reenforced the Montdidier-Noyon battle front northeast of Gournay. In\r\nthe course of the attacks the division suffered considerable losses.\r\nAbout July 2 it was relieved. It rested in rear of the Noyon front.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n2. On July 20 the division reenforced the battle front near Buzancy,\r\nsouth of Soissons. It lasted but one week and was then withdrawn.\r\n\r\n3. The effectives of the division was very low, due to the failure to\r\nreceive drafts. Early in August the division was disbanded. The 214th\r\nReserve Regiment was transferred to the 4th Division, the 216th Reserve\r\nRegiment to the 18th Reserve Division, and the 215th Reserve Regiment\r\nwas turned into the 4th Ersatz Division. The divisional commander, Maj.\r\nGen. Wasielewski, was retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. Although it was not heavily\r\nengaged in 1918, its effective strength was allowed to dwindle to a very\r\nlow level and dissolution followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        46th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │         1918[21]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │46 Ldw.      │101 Ldw.     │             │101 Ldw.\r\n              │             │103 Ldw.     │             │(?)\r\n              │             │105 Ldw.     │             │105 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 17 Uhlan Rgt.       │\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │Art.

It occupied the sector of Smorgoni-Lake Narotch until the beginning\r\nof 1918.\r\n\r\n2. About the month of September, 1917, it received a new regiment, the\r\n105th Landwehr, formed in 1917, at the time of the withdrawal of the\r\nSaxon battalions from the Prussian regiments of which they had been a\r\npart (345th and 374th Infantry Regiments). In December a great number of\r\nthe young men were taken from the division to reenforce the 40th\r\nDivision (Saxon) before its departure for France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe use made of the 46th Landwehr Division allows us to form an\r\nappreciation of its value; it held a calm sector on the Russian front in\r\n1917; occupied the Ukraine in 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. In January the division was on the Volhynian front, next to the 10th\r\nLandwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. In February it moved into the Ukraine, leaving behind elements whose\r\nduty it was to gather the matériel which had been abandoned in the\r\nRussian positions.\r\n\r\n3. About the middle of March the division held the sector north of\r\nMohilev. The 103d Landwehr Regiment was along the Berezina in April. The\r\n101st Landwehr Regiment was reported in the vicinity of Minsk early in\r\nMay. The whole division was identified in the Minsk region the end of\r\nthe month, and also toward the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         47th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │93 Res.  │217 Res. │93 Res.  │217 Res. │93 Res.  │217 Res.\r\n              │         │218 Res. │         │218 Res. │         │218 Res.\r\n              │94 Res.  │219 Res. │94 Res.  │219 Res. │94 Res.  │219 Res.\r\n              │         │220 Res. │         │220 Res. │         │220 Res.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │13\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  Landst.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │  (Wurtt.).\r\n              │ 19 Res.

The 47th Reserve Division, formed between August and October, 1914,\r\nand composing the 24th Reserve Corps with the 48th Reserve Division, was\r\nconcentrated in the vicinity of Metz about October 20, sent to the\r\nWoevre, south of Etain, on the 26th, went into action at Magnaville on\r\nthe 31st, and at Maucourt on November 6 to 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. On November 23 the 47th Reserve Division entrained for the Eastern\r\nFront.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNAJEC.\r\n\r\n3. Detraining in the vicinity of Cracow at the beginning of December, it\r\nwent into action on the Dunajec (Neu-Sandec) west of Tarnow on the 8th,\r\nwhere it suffered serious check on December 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. On January 10, 1915, the 47th Reserve Division was identified on the\r\nDunajec-Gorlice front.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. From the end of January to the month of April it occupied the front\r\nwest of Tarnow, near the Tarnow-Cracow railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n3. It took part in the spring and summer offensive of 1915. On July 2 it\r\nwas on the right bank of the Vistula, in the vicinity of Janow. From\r\nJuly 20 to August 9 it took part in the advance from the Wysnica to the\r\nWieprz, reached the Bug on October 19, the Jaselda on September 8, and\r\nfought along this last river until the 12th. On the 13th it was at\r\nSlonim.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of September it went to the vicinity of Baranovitchi. On\r\nOctober 19 it held the lines near Lipsk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 47th Reserve Division remained in the sector of Lipsk-\r\nBaranovitchi during the entire year of 1916 and until May, 1917, when it\r\nentrained for France. On July 23 the 217th Reserve Infantry Regiment was\r\nwithdrawn from the division to aid in the formation of the 225th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of May, 1917, the 47th Reserve Division was\r\ntransferred to the Western Front. (Itinerary of the 219th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment: Entrained on May 3 at Baranovitchi, Warsaw, Lodz,\r\nLissa, Glogau, Leipzig, Erfurt, Frankfort, Metz; detrained at\r\nBouillonville, near Thiaucourt, on May 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. After a stay in the Woevre, at Bois le Prêtre, until the beginning of\r\nJune, and a short rest near Marle, the 47th Reserve Division went into\r\nline north of Braye en Laonnois (west of the Épine de Chevregny) on June\r\n20. It took part in the attacks launched in this sector and suffered\r\nheavy losses from June 22 to July 8. Some of its elements were engaged\r\nin the French attack of October 23, after which they retired to the\r\nvillage of Chevregny.\r\n\r\n3. The 47th Reserve Division was relieved at the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORÊT DE ST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest in the villages of the Serre valley, it took over the\r\nsector of Septvaux in the Forêt de St. Gobain about November 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed at the time of its formation, the division has become entirely\r\nWestphalian since its reduction to three regiments. The levies from the\r\nRussian front in the course of 1917, however, introduced outside\r\nelements (men from the 1st, 2d, and 3d Corps District in May, coming\r\nfrom the 406th, 420th, and 421st Infantry Regiments). Thirteen prisoners\r\n(220th Reserve Infantry Regiment) captured on October 1, 1917, north of\r\nBraye en Laonnois, came from the following Provinces in Germany: 4 from\r\nWestphalia, 2 from Hanover, 3 from East Prussia, 1 from the Rhine\r\nProvince, 1 from Oldenburg, 1 from Silesia, and 1 from Pomerania.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 47th Reserve Division is a mediocre division more fitted for defense\r\nthan attack, but still capable of effort after rest and reorganization.\r\nIt had won some reputation in the offensive at Poland and Courland.\r\n\r\nIts effectives include a large proportion of Poles.\r\n\r\nIn the sector of Chevregny, Froidmont (June-July), it gave a good\r\naccount of itself, although sanitary conditions were very defective\r\n(Dec. 1, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. About the beginning of February the division was relieved by the 3d\r\nBavarian Division and went to train near Vervins.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged in the Somme offensive on March 21 near Tergnier and\r\nparticipated in the attack until the 25th. It was reengaged on April 1\r\nsouthwest of Lassigny and held that sector until May 2, when it was\r\nrelieved by the extension of the 206th Division.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained at Ham on May 6 and moved to St. Quentin area.\r\nFrom May 27 onward it followed up the advance behind the 113th Division,\r\nand finally relieved that division on June 1 near Vierzy. It was\r\nrelieved on June 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n4. This division, although greatly weakened, was returned to line\r\nwithout having been reconstructed, in the vicinity of Longpont. At this\r\ntime the division had not more than 40 to 50 rifles to a company. It\r\nagain suffered heavy losses, and about July 27 was retired to rest.\r\n\r\n5. The division was dissolved at Mainbresson on June 30. The 218th\r\nReserve Regiment was formed into one battalion, which became the 3d\r\nBattalion of the 53d Reserve Infantry Regiment. The 219th Reserve\r\nRegiment was drafted to the 159th Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. Its dissolution was occasioned\r\nby its low effective strength following its losses and failure to\r\nreceive drafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        47th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │47 Ldw.  │104 Ldw. │47 Ldw.  │104 Ldw. │47 Mixed │104 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │  Ldw.   │\r\n              │         │106 Ldw. │         │106 Ldw. │         │106 Ldw.\r\n              │         │         │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │Ldw.

Gen. Mueller, and was made a division in the autumn of\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. Detraining at Bourcy (northeast of Bastogne) on August 18, 1914, the\r\n47th Landwehr Brigade arrived on the Champagne front immediately after\r\nthe battle of the Marne.\r\n\r\n2. On September 14, 1914, the brigade was in line in the vicinity of\r\nMoronvilliers. It remained in Champagne until the beginning of 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. About the month of May, 1915, it left the sector Prosne Moronvilliers\r\nfor the north of Rheims, from Loivre to the Rheims-Witry road.\r\n\r\n2. Reenforced by the 113th Infantry Regiment, later by the 29th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment, it formed the Mueller Division in October.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of September one battalion of the 104th Landwehr Regiment\r\nwas sent as a reenforcement into action south of Ste. Marie à Py to help\r\nout the 133d Reserve Infantry Regiment during the French offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 47th Landwehr Brigade continued to occupy the Rheims sector\r\n(Courcy-Betheny) during 1916.\r\n\r\n2. In the month of July it was made a division (47th Landwehr Division)\r\nand received a 3d Regiment, the 391st Infantry Regiment (Saxon).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE LA FÈRE.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Rheims front about February 23, 1917, the 47th\r\nLandwehr Division was sent into line west of La Fère during the\r\nretirement of the German Army to the Hindenburg Line (Quessy-Travecy,\r\nMar. 23). It remained in the sector at La Fère until May 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of May the division was transferred to the Eastern\r\nFront, where it occupied the sector Goroditche-Tsirin. It exchanged with\r\nthe 219th Division, the 391st Infantry Regiment for the 100th Landwehr\r\nGrenadier Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 47th Landwehr Division is a mediocre division.

Concentrated near Metz in the middle of October, the 48th Reserve\r\nDivision was transferred on the 25th to the area between Armentières and\r\nLa Bassée (Fromelles), while the 47th Reserve Division was sent to the\r\nWoevre.\r\n\r\n2. On November 1 the division held the line at Neuve Chapelle. Some\r\nelements were sent farther north, west of Wytschaete, in the middle of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of November the 48th Reserve Division left the Western\r\nFront for Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n4. On December 3 it was identified in Poland in the vicinity of Kalisch.\r\nIt then made a part of the X Army and fought west of the Rawka, near\r\nWarsaw, at the end of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The 48th Reserve Division was engaged in Poland (Rawka) until January\r\n28, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARPATHIANS.\r\n\r\n2. On February 2 elements of the division fought in the Carpathians,\r\nsoutheast of Beskides. It was then assigned to the German Army of the\r\nSouth (Von Linsingen) and was opposed to the Russians in the vicinity of\r\nthe Uzsok Ridge (February-May).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. Taking part in the spring and summer offensive of 1915, it marched to\r\nHalicz in May; crossed the Dniester in the middle of June; advanced to\r\nBrzezany-Tarnopol and was on the Zlota-Lipa at the end of July. One of\r\nits regiments, the 224th Reserve Infantry Regiment, was renewed several\r\ntimes; the list of losses from August to October show casualties of 70\r\nofficers and 4,712 men, 3,100 of whom were reported as missing. The\r\ngreater part of these were Alsace-Lorrainers who had succeeded in\r\ndeserting.\r\n\r\n4. When the offensive was resumed in October and November the 48th\r\nReserve Division formed a part of the Bothmer Army and progressed from\r\nthe Zlota-Lipa as far as the Stripa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 48th Reserve Division was retained at the Stripa, west of\r\nTarnapol, during the winter and spring of 1916; it was still in this\r\nsector at the time of the Russian attack (Broussilow offensive, June to\r\nSeptember).\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n2. In the beginning of October the division went into action with the\r\nFalkenheim Army against Roumania, and fought in the vicinity of\r\nHermannstadt, then at Préoéal in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. It then left the Transylvanian front and went to eastern Galicia,\r\nwhere it was a part of the Bothmer Army. It took up its position between\r\nBrzezan, and the Dniester.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1917 the 224th Reserve Infantry Regiment left the\r\ndivision and was transferred to the 215th Division, in process of\r\nreorganization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. The 48th Reserve Division was relieved from its sector in May, 1917,\r\nand transferred to the Western Front (Itinerary: Lemberg-Jaroslav-\r\nCracow-Oppeln-Breslau-Leipzig-Erfurt-Gotha-Eisenach-Frankfort-Worms-\r\nSarrebruecken-Thionville-Montmedy-Dun sur Meuse). It rested in the\r\nvicinity of Stenay from May 27 to June 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. It was first behind the Verdun front, on the left bank of the Meuse.\r\nToward the end of June it sustained the artillery preparation for the\r\nFrench offensive of July 17, and sent some of its elements in as\r\nreenforcements (Hill 304-Morthomme) on the day of the attack.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to rest and reorganized in the Stenay area at the end of July.\r\nBy an important draft of men of the 1918 class, it went back into the\r\nsame sector (Hill 304-Corbeaux wood) on August 20, at the time of the\r\nnew French attack, and lost heavily reenforcing and relieving units of\r\nthe 6th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from the front on August 24, it was employed on various\r\nworks until September 3 and then sent into the area of Damvillers.\r\n\r\n6. On September 12 it went into line north of Hill 344, which it left at\r\nthe end of the month to go to rest in the vicinity of Morhange.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE-ALSACE.\r\n\r\n7. After holding the lines in Lorraine (middle of October to the middle\r\nof November) northeast of Arracourt, the 48th Reserve Division was sent\r\nto Alsace and went to rest for two months in the vicinity of Enisheim.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed upon formation (1 Thuringian Regiment), the division became, in\r\ntheory, a Hessian Division. The Alsace-Lorrainers were very numerous\r\nduring its stay on the Russian front, whence the desertions en masse\r\nfrom the 224th Infantry Regiment in the summer of 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, 1917, the 48th Reserve Division, coming from the\r\nRussian front, went into line at Hill 304, after a month’s rest near\r\nStenay. But as the men were not accustomed to the activity of the\r\nwestern front and were unable to sustain artillery fire for a long time,\r\nthey could only be kept in this sector for a few days.\r\n\r\nDuring the French attack of August 20 the 48th Reserve Division played\r\nonly a passive rôle.\r\n\r\nThe 48th Reserve Division must be classed among the mediocre divisions\r\n(December, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. About March 1 the division was relieved by the 22d Reserve Division\r\nand went into reserve in Alsace. It left that sector about April 1 and\r\ncame into line on the 14th southwest of Vieux Berquin. It was engaged in\r\nthat locality until its relief on the night of May 26–27 by the 32d\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEUX BERQUIN.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested in the Lille area until June 28, when it returned\r\nto its former sector at Vieux Berquin. Its stay here was short. On July\r\n3 it was relieved by the 39th Division and entrained at Laventie the\r\nnext day for Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE.\r\n\r\n3. On the night of July 6–7 the division relieved the 187th Division\r\nsouthwest of Gavrelle. Throughout August and September the division held\r\nthis sector. It was relieved north of the Scarpe on the night of October\r\n5–6 and moved south.\r\n\r\n4. The division was used to reenforce the Cambrai-St. Quentin front near\r\nCambrai on October 7. Thereafter almost until the day of the armistice\r\nthe division was engaged in opposing the British advance. The direction\r\nof its retreat was through Awoingt (10th), Saulzoir (13th), Montrecourt\r\n(14th), north of Haussy (17th), Vendegies (24th), Maresches (Nov. 1),\r\nJenlain (4th). The division received drafts from the dissolved 118th\r\nReserve Regiment (25th Reserve Division) in late October. It was\r\nwithdrawn from line about November 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. In 1918 it was engaged entirely\r\nin defensive sectors and performed with credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        48th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1917        │       1918        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │38       │1 Landst.│38       │1 Landst.│38\r\n              │         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.\r\n              │         │39       │         │40       │         │40\r\n              │         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.\r\n              │         │47       │         │47       │         │47\r\n              │         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.│         │  Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │3 Sqn. 14 Uhlan\r\n              │                   │                   │  Rgt.\r\n              │                   │                   │1 Sqn.

The 48th Landwehr Division appears to have been formed on the\r\nLorraine front in September, 1917, by the grouping of three new\r\nregiments—the 38th Landsturm, the 39th Landsturm (Wurttemberg), and the\r\n47th Landsturm—the elements of which had previously been employed behind\r\nthe front or in calm sectors.\r\n\r\n2. In September, 1917, the 48th Landwehr Division occupied the sector of\r\nAvricourt (Leintrey-Gondrexon, Embermenil).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 48th Landwehr Division is composed of troops of mediocre value.\r\n\r\nThe average age of the men is 40 years. A certain number of young\r\nsoldiers of the 1918 class are to be found in most of the units. Sent\r\ninto these Landsturm divisions because of their reduced physical\r\nfitness, they left them for active or reserve units as soon as they\r\nbecame hardened.\r\n\r\nThere is a divisional assault company which has never shown any\r\noffensive activity (July, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

The 49th Reserve Division, forming the 25th Reserve Corps with the\r\n50th Reserve Division, was formed between August and October, 1914,\r\ntrained at the Warthe Camp, and sent to East Prussia on October 14,\r\n1914, as a part of the 8th Army (Von Hindenburg).\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n2. It took part in the offensive in Poland between the Vistula and the\r\nWarta at the end of October, escaped from the enveloping movement\r\nattempted by the Russians before Lodz (Nov. 25), and fought on the front\r\nof the Bzura, Rawka, Bolimow, where it was repulsed in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1915, the 49th Reserve Division was\r\nagain engaged on the Bzura and remained in this area until the summer of\r\nthe same year. In June it transferred the 227th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment to the 107th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. Advancing in August with the Hindenburg offensive, it entered Warsaw\r\non August 7, took part in the pursuit of the Russians in the sector of\r\nSkierniewicz, and stopped near Baranovitchi (Tsirin).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 49th Reserve Division was still occupying the sector north of\r\nBaranovitchi when the Russian offensive broke out in this region in\r\nJuly, 1916. At this time elements of the division were sent to reenforce\r\nthe 35th Austrian Division between Baranovitchi and the north of Pripet.\r\nThis latter division was relieved a short time afterwards by the 49th\r\nReserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. Sent into Galicia, the division held the lines southwest of Brody at\r\nthe beginning of October. At this time the 225th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment was sent to Roumania.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARPATHIANS.\r\n\r\n3. Made up only of the 226th and 228th Reserve Infantry Regiments, the\r\n49th Reserve Division opposed the Russians on the Narajowka, then, at\r\nthe beginning of December and until January, 1917, fought in the\r\nCarpathians in the vicinity of Worochta.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 49th Reserve Division rejoined the 225th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment (Roumania) in the valley of Uz.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of January it was transferred to the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary: Szekely-Udvarhely-Goborin-Budapest-Oderberg-Oppeln-Breslau-\r\nGoerlitz-Dresden-Leipzig-Halle-Liege-Mons-St. Ghislain, detraining on\r\nJan. 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. After a rest of two months in the vicinity of Mons, then in the\r\nvicinity of Lille, the 49th Reserve Division went into line east of\r\nArmentières, south of Frelinghien on March 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved at the end of April, it was engaged almost at once in the\r\nsector of Fontaine les Croisilles, Bullecourt (southeast of Arras),\r\nwhere it suffered very heavily from May 1 to May 21. On June 16, after\r\nreorganization, the ranks of the 228th Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\ncontained more than two-fifths new recruits; more than one-fifth of the\r\nmen belonged to the 1918 class.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to rest and to be reorganized during the month of June in the\r\nvicinity of Tournai-Audenarde, it went into line at the end of June in\r\nthe sector of Steenstraat-Bixschoote (north of Ypres), and suffered\r\nheavy losses during the artillery preparation which preceded the Franco-\r\nBritish attack of July 21. On July 28 it was withdrawn from the front\r\nbefore the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. The 49th Reserve Division rested and was reorganized in the month of\r\nAugust between Lille and Tournai, and in September took over its old\r\nArtois sector (Croisilles-Bullecourt), from which place it was relieved\r\nat the end of October.\r\n\r\n7. After occupying the sector south of the Ypres-Menin road until\r\nNovember 21, it went into action about November 26 in the same sector of\r\nCroisilles-Bullecourt (Cambrai attack).\r\n\r\n8. At the end of December, the 49th Reserve Division was resting in the\r\nTourcoing area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nFormed at the beginning by contingents from the 5th and 6th Corps\r\nDistricts (Posen and Silesia) the Division, beginning with the summer of\r\n1915, received most of its reenforcements from the 4th Corps District.\r\nAt the present time it is entirely Saxo-Thuringian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 49th Reserve Division is considered a good division.\r\n\r\nIt fought well in Artois in May 1917. North of Ypres it suffered heavily\r\nby the Franco-British bombardment at the end of July, 1917. It is to be\r\nnoted that under artillery fire units in the first line scattered and\r\nfled. The remnants of the advanced elements deserted (30 men).\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 1917, the 226th Reserve Infantry Regiment received\r\nreplacements of 500 to 700 men, principally of the 1918 class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSINES.\r\n\r\n1. About April 6 the division temporarily withdrew to reserve. It\r\nreturned on the 11th and carried out a divisional attack on Messines. It\r\nwas engaged until about April 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. Two days later the division relieved the 13th Reserve Division south\r\nof Ypres, which in turn relieved it about May 2. It remained in rear of\r\nthe front while resting and was engaged east of Bixschoote on May 10.\r\nHere the division remained until June 14, when the 29th Division\r\nrelieved it. The division rested in the Bruges area until July 10, when\r\nit returned to its former sector northeast of Ypres. It held this sector\r\nuntil about August 27, when the 11th Bavarian Division relieved it.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained at Hooglede August 27 and traveled to\r\nCourtrai, where it halted one day. On August 28 it moved to Iwuy, from\r\nwhere it marched to Lallaing (near Douai) two days later. On September 1\r\nthe division came into line near Fremicourt. It was engaged until about\r\nSeptember 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested in the Cambrai area until September 27, where it\r\nwas identified in line west of Gaincourt. It again retired from the\r\nfront about October 1 and rested in the Eswars area. On the Scarpe-Somme\r\nfront in September the division lost 1,100 prisoners.\r\n\r\n5. On the night of October 11–12 the division was again in line at\r\nCourcelles les Lens. After holding this rather quiet sector for a week\r\nthe division moved north and on October 29 appeared on the Ypres front\r\nat Anseghem in relief of the 7th Cavalry Division.

At the end of March, 1915, the 158th and 53d Infantry Regiments were\r\nidentified at Hirson (Aisne), while the 39th Fusileer Regiment was still\r\nbetween Perthes and Tahure. In April the division was concentrated and\r\nwas identified in Champagne, May 14 (area south of Somme-Py).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. From June to October it occupied the sector of Tahure (north of\r\nPerthes and Mesnil les Hurlus). It there underwent the French offensive\r\nof the end of September, which caused it very heavy losses—infantry, 130\r\nofficers and 7,849 men casualties; the 100th Company of Pioneers lost 5\r\nofficers and 135 men.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to rest and reorganized in the vicinity of Vouziers and of\r\nJuniville (end of October to the end of November), it reappeared on\r\nNovember 7 north of Prosnes (east of Reims).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1916, the division left the sector of Prosnes-Prunay, for\r\nthe front northeast of Verdun (Ornes).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN-VAUX.\r\n\r\n2. Going into action, at the beginning of May, north of Vaux, it took\r\npart in the attacks launched upon the line Caillette wood-Damloup (June\r\n1 to June 3), which ended in the capture of the fort of Vaux by the\r\n158th Infantry Regiment on June 4.\r\n\r\n3. Very much exhausted by these battles, the division was sent to rest\r\nand reorganized in the vicinity of Étain in June and July.\r\n\r\n4. In July elements of the division occupied the calm sectors of the\r\nWoëvre.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of July the 50th Division went back into line at Verdun,\r\nsouth of the fort of Vaux. It launched an attack on August 1 (La\r\nLaufée), underwent the French offensives of August 8 and October 24,\r\nsuffering heavy losses, and held this sector until November.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. Sent to the Argonne, it took over the sector of Vauquois.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Argonne on February 15, 1917, the division\r\nremained at rest in the area of Saulces-Champenoise until the end of\r\nMarch, then in the camp at Sissonne, then at Thenailles, near Vervins\r\n(beginning of April).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated on April 8, it went into action on the 15th at\r\nJuvincourt and there underwent the French attack of April 15. After\r\nheavy losses it was relieved between April 29-April 27 and went for\r\nreorganization to Nizy le Comte, near the Sissonne Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n3. About May 10, the division went back into line east of Allment on the\r\nChemin des Dames.\r\n\r\n4. It was sent to rest in July in the vicinity of Mons en Laonnois,\r\nCoucy les Eppes, Parfondru.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of August, it came back to the Chemin des Dames\r\n(vicinity of Ailles), where, on October 15, the 9th Company of the 158th\r\nInfantry Regiment was reduced to 50 men, including officers (letter).\r\nFollowing the French offensive upon La Malmaison, the 50th Division\r\nretired on November 1, to the north of the Ailette toward Neuville\r\n(outside of Chamouille) and was still occupying this sector in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nUpon its formation the division was composed of Westphalian troops. The\r\nrecruiting is still almost exclusively Westphalian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nSince the battle of Vaux in June, 1916, the division likes to consider\r\nitself a shock division.\r\n\r\nIts prolonged stay on the Ailette front (August to December) seems to\r\nmean that it had to be put at rest for a fairly long time before being\r\nengaged in an active sector.\r\n\r\nIt must be regarded as a good division, capable of putting up a vigorous\r\ndefense (December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 50th Division was withdrawn from line near Ailles (west of\r\nCraonne) on January 9, the neighboring divisions extending their fronts,\r\nand moved by easy stages to the Chimay area, where it arrived on the\r\n14th. It remained here for a month during which time it was thoroughly\r\ntrained in open warfare and brought up to strength. It then moved to the\r\nLa Capelle-Fontenelle area for rest and further training.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n2. The middle of March the division moved up to the front, and on the\r\n21st attacked in the front line southwest of St. Quentin; it captured\r\nHolnon during the day, Etreillers on the 22d, Hangest en Santerre on the\r\n29th, and reached Moreuil on the 30th. It was withdrawn about April 1,\r\nafter having suffered severely heavy losses, and went to rest, refit,\r\nand train in the Lassigny region.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On May 27, the division attacked near Craonne, reached Pontavert\r\ntoward noon and crossed the Aisne. The following day it crossed the\r\nVesle west of Breuil sur Vesle and continued to the south, where a\r\nFrench counterattack was repelled. On the 30th it reached Goussancourt,\r\nand then the Marne east of Dormans. After having suffered severe losses,\r\nit was relieved by the 28th Reserve Division during the night of June\r\n12–13, and went to rest in the Laon region.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n4. On the 19th of July the division was thrown into line just southwest\r\nof Rheims to meet the Allies’ tightening at the bases of the Chateau-\r\nThierry salient. It was withdrawn early in August.\r\n\r\n5. About the 30th of September it came back into line northwest of\r\nRheims, near Prouilly and Cormicy. It remained here, and was driven\r\nback—fighting stubbornly—passing near Brimont, Guignicourt, and Banogne,\r\nwhere it was withdrawn on the 7th of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. After a day’s rest, the division was put back into line on the 8th\r\nnear Mezieres; it had not been withdrawn when the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 50th is rated as a first-class division. It distinguished itself in\r\nthe fighting during 1918. After the Somme offensive, it was praised by\r\nProf. Wegener in the Koelnische Zeitung. Immediately after the battle of\r\nthe Aisne Maj. Fritsch, in command of the 158th Regiment, was awarded\r\nPour le Mérite. After the Allied counteroffensive, Lieut. Gen. V.\r\nEngelhuhten, the division commander, was decorated and made governor of\r\nRiga, and the commander of the 53d Regiment was also decorated. The 58th\r\nRegiment was mentioned as having particularly distinguished itself in\r\nthe fighting near Banogne in the German communique of October 30. Losses\r\nsuffered throughout the year were enormous, but the High Command did all\r\nin its power to make these good. There are no desertions of record since\r\nJuly 1, 1917. The morale was very good, everything being taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         50th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │99 Res.  │229 Res. │99 Res.  │229 Res. │99 Res.  │229 Res.\r\n              │         │230 Res. │         │230 Res. │         │230 Res.\r\n              │100 Res. │231 Res. │100 Res. │231 Res. │         │231 Res.\r\n              │         │232 Res. │         │232 Res. │         │\r\n              │ 22 Res.

The 50th Reserve Division (belonging to the 1st series of divisions\r\ncreated between August and October, 1914), formed a part of the 25th\r\nReserve Corps with the 49th Reserve Division. It received its training,\r\nat the time of its formation, in the Alten-Grabow Camp in the 4th Corps\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of October the 50th Reserve Division and the 49th\r\nReserve Division belonged to the 8th Army (Von Hindenburg) and took part\r\nin the second German offensive in Poland (battles between the Vistula\r\nand the Warta in October, Lodz in November, on the Bzura-Rawka front in\r\nDecember).\r\n\r\nSince November the 25th Reserve Corps has belonged to the 9th Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. Engaged in the operations along the Bzura (region of Bolimow) during\r\nthe winter and spring of 1915, the 50th Reserve Division took part in\r\nthe summer offensive of Von Hindenburg and pursued the Russians to the\r\nvicinity of Baranovitchi. In June it transferred the 232d Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment to the 107th Division, a new formation.\r\n\r\n2. In September the 25th Reserve Corps was dissolved—the 49th Reserve\r\nDivision remained in Russia, the 50th Reserved Division was transferred\r\nto the Western Front. The division entrained at Kovno on October 7.\r\n(Itinerary: Koenigsberg-Marienburg-Stettin-Hamburg-Bremen-Osnabrueck-\r\nMuenster-Aix la Chapelle-Namur-Givet.) It detrained at Rethel October\r\n13–14.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE-CHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. On October 16 the 50th Reserve Division was sent to Champagne. It\r\ncooperated in the gas attack of October 27 in the vicinity of Rheims and\r\nremained in line until December 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. Entraining at Witry les Rheims for Douai on December 21, it took over\r\nthe sector Roclincourt, east of Neuville-St. Vaast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Having lost heavily at Neuville-St. Vaast, the 50th Reserve Division\r\nwas withdrawn from this sector in March, 1916, and south of Armentières\r\n(Grenier wood), from April to September. It rested in this calm sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. About December 16 the division was relieved and went into action on\r\nthe Somme (Martinpuich-Flers), from September 20 to 28. It suffered very\r\nheavily there.\r\n\r\n3. From October 6 to November 11 it occupied the sector south of the\r\ncanal of La Bassée (northeast of Vermelles).\r\n\r\n4. The division returned to the Somme, on both banks of the Ancre (near\r\nMiraumont, Grandcourt), about November 20, and remained in this active\r\nsector until December 22.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of December it went to rest in the vicinity of\r\nValenciennes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the elements of the 50th Reserve Division were in\r\nreserve at Achiet le Petit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of January the 50th Reserve Division came back into line\r\nnorth of the Ancre (Beaumont-Hamel); it lost heavily there (200\r\nprisoners) on February 11.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the Somme front at the beginning of March, it went\r\ninto line east of Transloy (south of Bapaume) on March 13. It withdrew\r\nto the Hindenburg Line, near Metz en Couture (southwest of Cambrai), and\r\nremained there from the end of March to April 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest in the vicinity of Douai until the middle of May, the\r\ndivision took over the sector of Oppy-Gavrelle, northeast of Arras,\r\nwhere it did not take part in any important action (May 18 to June 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to the Ypres front about June 11, in anticipation of the\r\nBritish attack, it was kept in reserve in the vicinity of Roulers until\r\nJuly 24.\r\n\r\n6. On July 31 the 50th Reserve Division went into action in St. Julien\r\nand suffered heavy losses while fighting for the possession of the\r\nvillage (Aug. 1–2).\r\n\r\n7. Relieved on August 10 it was sent to rest in the vicinity of Mons and\r\nwent back into line on September 20, was engaged on the 26th in the\r\nvicinity of Gheluvelt, and left the Ypres front on October 3, after\r\nserious losses—the 1st Company of the 231st Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\nwas reduced to 15 men after September 21, the 6th Company to 28.\r\n(British Summary of Information, Oct. 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\n8. At the end of October it took over a sector in the vicinity of Lille\r\n(Fromelles) (until the middle of December).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n9. It then occupied the lines before Cambrai south of Marcoing and\r\nMasnières (Dec. 21-Jan. 31, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning the 50th Reserve Division was composed of drafts from\r\nSilesia and Prussian Saxony, but after the end of 1915 it received most\r\nof its replacements from the 10th Corps District. The 229th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment is from Brunswick; the two others from Hanover. In\r\ncertain documents we find the division designated as “troops from lower\r\nSaxony.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 50th Reserve Division took part in a great number of battles.\r\n\r\nIts morale was shaken by the heavy losses which it suffered; it has\r\nimproved very much.\r\n\r\nThe division fought comparatively well at Ypres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 50th Reserve Division was withdrawn from line south of Marcoing\r\non the 31st of January, the neighboring divisions extending their\r\nfronts, and went to the area east of Cambrai, where it received training\r\nin open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 13th of March the division marched from Cagnoncles via\r\nCarnières and Cattenières to Esnes, and on the 17th proceeded to Villers\r\nOutreaux. On the 20th it came into line southwest of Cambrai and took\r\npart in the attack of the 21st. The division suffered very heavy losses\r\nand was relieved by the 9th Reserve Division on the 22d, going to rest\r\nat Liéramont (northeast of Peronne).\r\n\r\n3. On the 23d the division followed up the advance behind the 9th\r\nReserve Division via St. Pierre-Vaast wood (24th), Rancourt-Combles\r\n(25th), Montauban (26th), Fricourt (27th), and on the following day went\r\ninto line southwest of Albert, carrying out an unsuccessful attack. In\r\nanother attack against the ridge west of Dernancourt on April 5 the\r\ndivision was beaten back with heavy losses. It was relieved on the 9th\r\nand went to rest at Maricourt.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of April 17–18 it relieved the 18th Division near\r\nMorlancourt (south of Albert). It was relieved by the 199th Division\r\nearly in May and went to rest and refit in the Solesmes area.\r\n\r\n5. On the 24th of May it traveled by rail to Montauban (south of\r\nAlbert), marched via Maricourt to Carnoy the following day, and came\r\ninto line during the night of May 27th–28th south of Albert. It was\r\nrelieved by the 54th Reserve Division on June 28 and went to rest near\r\nCambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n6. On the 19th of July the division entrained at Le Cateau and traveled\r\nvia St. Quentin to Chauny, where it was loaded on trucks and sent to the\r\nForêt de Pinon. On the 28th it relieved the 20th Division near Buzancy\r\n(south of Soissons). Here it was gradually forced to retire toward the\r\nnortheast, was finally withdrawn to the north of Braine about the 20th\r\nof August, and went to the region between Laval and Laon.\r\n\r\n7. The presence of elements of the 231st Reserve Regiment was reported\r\nthe 4th of September west of Vauxaillon, and on the 6th to the south of\r\nNeuville sous Margival, the rest of the regiment being in the Urcel-\r\nLaval region.\r\n\r\n8. On September 14 the whole division went back into line east of\r\nSoissons near the Mennejean Farm. This was surrounded by the French on\r\nthe 15th. The following day Sancy fell to them, too. The same day the\r\nplateau to the east and northeast of the Mennejean Farm was captured. On\r\nthe 18th the division lost still more ground and prisoners; it was\r\nwithdrawn on the 21st and went to rest near St. Pierre a Arnes (south of\r\nMachault).\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n9. On the 2d of October the division came back into line northeast of\r\nRheims, near Bétheny, and went through very heavy fighting. It was still\r\nin line on November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nOn October 11 the following was written: “The division did fairly well\r\nin its recent encounters, the men, though lacking in enthusiasm, seeming\r\npossessed by a dogged determination to do what they conceived to be\r\ntheir duty. The morale, which was good, has been very much lowered by\r\nrecent losses.” That this statement is erroneous seems to be proved by\r\nthe fact that the German communiqués of October 22, November 1 and 2,\r\nsay that the division “had shown particular merit in the recent\r\nfighting, retook their position in counterattack and repulsed hostile\r\nattacks,” “bore the brunt of the fighting * * * without showing signs of\r\nweariness,” and “again maintained their positions against heavy\r\nattacks.” Therefore, although the division suffered heavy losses,\r\nespecially in the spring, it is still to be considered as second class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         51st Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │101 Res. │233 Res. │101 Res. │233 Res. │101 Res. │233 Res.\r\n              │         │234 Res. │         │234 Res. │         │235 Res.\r\n              │102 Res. │235 Res. │102 Res. │235 Res. │102 Res. │234 Res.\r\n              │         │236 Res. │         │236 Res. │         │236 Res.\r\n              │ 23 Res.

The 51st Reserve Division (of the series of divisions created between\r\nAugust and October, 1914), forming the 26th Reserve Corps with the 52d\r\nReserve Division, went into action northeast of Ypres in the middle of\r\nOctober. It fought on the line Cortemarck-Moorslede on the 22d, reached\r\nLangemarck on the 24th, and finally took up its position near\r\nPoelcappelle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the area northeast of Ypres (Poelcappelle,\r\nLangemarck, St. Julien) during the entire year of 1915, and until\r\nSeptember, 1916. In September, 1916, it transferred the 233d Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment to the 195th Division, a new formation, in consequence\r\nof the Russian advance in Galicia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. On September 16, 1916, the 51st Reserve Division was relieved from\r\nthe sector of Wieltje (north of the Ypres-Zonnebeke road) and\r\ntransferred to the Somme. It went into action between Combles and Morval\r\nabout December 18 and suffered very heavy losses from the British attack\r\nof the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. After occupying the Lille front (Neuve Chapelle) for a few days, the\r\ndivision was sent to Champagne at the beginning of October.\r\n\r\nIt took over the sector of Tahure-Rouvroy (south of Ripont) in the\r\nmiddle of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 51st Reserve Division remained on the Massiges front until the\r\nmiddle of May, 1917, with a short rest at the end of February.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged in the attacks on Maisons de Champagne in March, and\r\nsuffered quite heavily.\r\n\r\n3. In the middle of May it went into line near Nauroy and Moronvilliers\r\n(Casque-Mont Haut), where it lost heavily.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the front about June 8, it returned, after a short\r\nrest in the vicinity of Marvaux, to the sector east of Tahure (June 22-\r\nAug. 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. Brought back to the right bank of the Meuse, after a rest in the\r\nvicinity of Sedan-Montmédy, the division occupied the sector of\r\nSamogneux-Hill 344, about August 22, and lost heavily (French attack of\r\nAug. 25, German attack of Sept. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. It was relieved about September 12 and sent to rest behind the\r\nChampagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed at the time of its formation, the division is actually recruited\r\nin the 11th Corps District (Electorate of Hesse and Thuringia), and is\r\nso designated in various documents. Beginning with March 13, 1917, it\r\nhas received young men of the 1918 class who have less than four months’\r\ntraining (236th Reserve Infantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 51st Reserve Division was good at the beginning of the war, but now\r\nappears mediocre.\r\n\r\nHealth conditions seem to be poor (August, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 51st Reserve Division remained in the Vouziers being trained\r\nuntil about the 20th of January, when it relieved the 52d Division near\r\nthe Butte du Mesnil. It was relieved early in March and went to the\r\nVouziers-Rethel area, where it received some more training in open\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 20th it entrained, and arrived at Etreux (north of Guise) the\r\nfollowing day. From there it marched via St. Quentin-Ham-Roye-Faverolles\r\nto Montdidier, where it arrived on the 30th. The following day it\r\nreenforced the front near Ayencourt (south of Montdidier), relieving the\r\n9th Division. It was relieved by the 2d Division during the night of the\r\n1st-2d of May and went to rest in the Chimay area.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 30th of May the division, thoroughly rested and brought up to\r\nstrength, reenforced the battle front near Vauxbuin (southwest of\r\nSoissons). Here it became heavily engaged and suffered severe losses,\r\nespecially the first two days. It was relieved near Cutry (southwest of\r\nSoissons) on June 16, and went to rest near Oulchy le Chateau.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of July 19–20, the division reenforced the front\r\nnear Blanzy (south of Soissons). Here it became heavily engaged. It was\r\nforced back by the Allied counteroffensive, and was withdrawn from line\r\nsouth of Braine early in August. It went to rest near Marle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 28 the division entered line near Somme-Py (north of\r\nSuippes). Here it was badly handled and had to be withdrawn on the 4th\r\nof October, when it had been driven back to St. Etienne à Py. It then\r\nrested for a day or two near Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n6. On the 6th it entrained at Vouziers and Vrizy and arrived at La\r\nFerté-Chevresis two days later. It was then put on trucks and moved up\r\nto the front, taking over the Bernot-Origny sector (east of St. Quentin)\r\non the 8th. It was withdrawn about the 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n7. After having rested a fortnight between the Oise and the Aisne, the\r\ndivision entered line east of Rethel on the 31st, remaining in line\r\nuntil the signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 51st Reserve is to be considered a good second-class division. It\r\ndid not distinguish itself by any brilliant fighting, but it did acquit\r\nitself in the battles of the Somme and the Aisne and during the Allied\r\ncounteroffensive. It suffered exceedingly heavy losses, but these were\r\nin large measure made good by drafts of 1919 class recruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             52d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │104.          │66.           │104.          │66.\r\n              │              │169.          │              │169.\r\n              │              │170.          │              │170.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │(2) Sqn. 16 Uhlan Rgt.       │2 Sqn. 16 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │52 Brig.:                    │52 Brig.:\r\n              │ 103 F.

On April 6, 1917, the last-named\r\nregiment was replaced by the 111th Infantry Regiment (the 4th Regiment\r\nof the 28th Division, also from Baden).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the 52d Division was in line south of Arras (Monchy\r\naux Bois, Hebuterne). It occupied this sector until September, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. During the Franco-English offensive on the Somme the 52d Division\r\nbore to the south and held the sector Hebuterne, Beaumont-Hamel, north\r\nof Thiepval (September-November, 1916).\r\n\r\n2. On November 26 the division was withdrawn from the front and sent to\r\nrest in the vicinity of Bouchain (December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. On January 13, 1917, the 52d Division was sent to Alsace (northwest\r\nof Bale).\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of January it took over the sector of Altkirch\r\n(Carspach-Hirtzbach), which it held until the end of March.\r\n\r\n3. After a few days at rest (at the beginning of April) in the Grand\r\nDuchy of Baden south of Muellheim, it entrained on April 16 north of\r\nBale and was transferred to the Aisne, already including men of the 1918\r\nclass in its ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. On April 21 it went into line south of Juvincourt. It occupied this\r\nsector until July 10, with a period of rest from June 1 to 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIE PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n5. About July 24 it went back into line on the Californie Plateau, where\r\nit launched an attack on September 14.\r\n\r\n6. Sent into rest in the vicinity of Sissonne about the end of\r\nSeptember, it appeared in the vicinity of Pinon about the middle of\r\nOctober, where it went into action and lost heavily on the 23d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n7. After a rest in the vicinity of Chimay (beginning of November), it\r\nwent into line on the Champagne front (Butte du Mesnil-Maisons de\r\nChampagne); it remained there until December 15.\r\n\r\n8. From December 15 until January, 1918, it was at rest in the vicinity\r\nof Vouziers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSince April, 1917, the 52d Division has been almost purely Badensian.\r\nBesides the Badensians, who form almost all of the drafts, we find men\r\nfrom the neighboring districts of the Empire (Rhine Province, Hesse-\r\nNassau).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn general the morale of the 52d Division has appeared rather high. In\r\nthe sector of Juvincourt (April to July, 1917) the troops of the\r\ndivision showed nerve and dash in the course of the local operations in\r\nwhich they took part.\r\n\r\nThe division had few losses until the month of September.\r\n\r\nHowever, it lost heavily on October 23 (the battle of La Malmaison),\r\nespecially the 170th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 52d Division, which had been resting near Vouziers since December\r\n15, relieved the 52d Reserve Division near Tahure (northeast of Suippes)\r\non the 10th of January. During the time the division held this sector\r\nthe elements not actually in the front line were being trained in open\r\nwarfare. Early in March it was relieved by the 52d Reserve Division and\r\nwent to the Vouziers area, where it received still more intensive\r\ntraining in the war of movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. The division entrained near Vouziers on the 22d of March, and\r\ndetrained on the following day near Bohain. On the 24th it left and\r\nmarched via Fresnoy le Grand-Holnon wood (26th)-Bethenicourt (27th)-\r\nEtalon-Liancourt-Fosse to Fresnoy les Roye. It relieved the 28th\r\nDivision near Hangest en Santerre (northwest of Montdidier) on the 28th.\r\nIt was relieved by the 76th Reserve Division on the 14th of April and\r\nwent to rest in the Sedan area.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Here it was thoroughly reconstituted. It entrained on the 22d of May,\r\narriving at La Malmaison (southeast of Laon) the same day. On the 26th\r\nit went into line near Juvincourt (east of Craonne), and took part in\r\nthe initial attack on the following day. It crossed the Aisne between\r\nPontavert and Gernicourt; proceeding via Bouvancourt and Guyancourt, it\r\ncrossed the Vesle at Jonquery on the 28th, reached Faverolles on the\r\n29th, Olizy on the 31st, and the Marne, in the region of Verneuil, on\r\nJune 2. The division was at first ordered to cross the same day, but the\r\norder was subsequently rescinded. It was withdrawn, after having\r\nsuffered severely, about the 10th, and was reported to be at rest in the\r\nSedan area on the 15th. On the 20th it was reported in reserve in the\r\nTournai region.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of July 12–13 it relieved the 119th Division in the\r\nAvion sector (south of Lens). It was relieved about the 5th of August by\r\nthe extension of fronts of flanking divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENTIERES.\r\n\r\n5. During the night of the 6th–7th it relieved the 207th Division near\r\nVieux Berquin (southwest of Bailleul), the 207th Division taking over\r\nthe sector just vacated by the 52d Division. On the 17th it was\r\nwithdrawn, the neighboring divisions extending their fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPAUME.\r\n\r\n6. Five days later it reenforced the battle front near Miraumont (west\r\nof Bapaume). It was withdrawn about the 4th of September, after having\r\nlost over 1,300 prisoners, and went to rest in the Courtrai area. Here\r\nthe battalions were reduced to three companies, the strength of which\r\nwas further made up by drafts of the 29th Ersatz Regiment (223d Division\r\ndisbanded).\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. On September 28 the division reenforced the front near Exermont\r\n(southeast of Grandpre). In the heavy fighting that followed the\r\ndivision was driven back to Landres et St. Georges, where it was\r\nwithdrawn about the 14th of October after having suffered heavy losses\r\n(almost 600 in prisoners alone).\r\n\r\n8. During the night of October 31-November 1 the division, which had\r\nreceived large numbers of replacements during its two weeks’ rest,\r\nrelieved the 41st Division east of Busancy (north of Grandpre). It was\r\nstill in line on the 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 52d is rated as one of the best German divisions. It was in a great\r\ndeal of heavy fighting during 1918 (as in preceding years) and acquitted\r\nitself most creditably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         52d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │103 Res. │237 Res. │103 Res. │237 Res. │103 Res. │237 Res.\r\n              │         │238 Res. │         │238 Res. │         │238 Res.\r\n              │104 Res. │239 Res. │104 Res. │239 Res. │104 Res. │239 Res.\r\n              │         │240 Res. │         │240 Res. │         │240 Res.\r\n              │ 24 Res.

The 52d Reserve Division (belonging to the 26th Reserve Corps with\r\nthe 51st Reserve Division), formed between August and October, 1914, was\r\ntrained at the Senne Camp and entrained for Belgium on October 12.\r\n\r\nThe division was engaged in the first battle of the Ypres about October\r\n22.\r\n\r\nIt fought in October and November in the vicinity of Langemarck-\r\nPassachendaele and suffered heavy losses. Between October 18 and 28, the\r\n240th Reserve Infantry Regiment listed casualties of 28 officers and\r\n1,360 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained on the front north of Ypres (Pilckem, St.\r\nJulien, Zonnebeke) during the year 1915 and until the month of\r\nSeptember, 1916. Certain of its regiments lost very heavily in April and\r\nMay—25 officers and 1,268 men casualties in the 240th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. About September 14, 1916, it was transferred to the Somme minus the\r\n237th Reserve Infantry Regiment, sent to Galicia for the formation of\r\nthe 199th Division.\r\n\r\nIt was engaged in the Lesboeufs sector (Sept. 16–29) and lost very\r\nheavily in the British attack of the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to Champagne, it went into line at the Butte de Souain on\r\nOctober 6, then on November 6 entered St. Marie à Py and the vicinity of\r\nTahure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 52d Reserve Division occupied the Tahure front south of Rouvroy\r\nuntil April 20, 1917. It suffered losses at Maisons de Champagne, at the\r\nend of March, which caused hasty replacements of the 1918 class with\r\nonly four months’ training to be sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPIGNEUL.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved between April 15 and 20, it went to the vicinity of Rethel\r\nand passed in review at Asfeld on May 3; went into line on the 5th\r\nsoutheast of Berry au Bac and underwent the French attack of the 7th\r\nsouth of Sapigneul. (The 239th Reserve Division had 107 prisoners\r\ntaken.) On May 31 it again lost heavily while attacking Hill 108.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn from the Aisne front at the beginning of\r\nJuly and transferred to Belgium. It went into action on the Ypres-Menin\r\nroad on the 31st, the day of the British offensive, and lost heavily.\r\nThe attacks of August 10 again caused serious losses—the remnants of the\r\n1st Battalion of the 238th Reserve Infantry Regiment formed only two\r\ncompanies at the time of their relief. (British Summary of Information,\r\nAug. 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. About August 11 the 52d Reserve Division left the Belgian front for\r\nChampagne, where it again took over its own sector east of the Butte de\r\nSouain about August 26. It remained there until the end of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its formation the 52d Reserve Division was made up of one\r\nRhenish Regiment and three from Baden; to-day it is entirely Rhenish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn May and June, 1917, the 52d Reserve Division held a very difficult\r\nsector south of Berry au Bac where it apparently lost very heavily.\r\nHowever, it acted like a good division.\r\n\r\nDuring its rest in the vicinity of Vouziers, at the end of January,\r\n1918, it was given very intensive training. It was considered as an\r\nattack division. (Interrogation of prisoners, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 52d Reserve Division was relieved by the 52d Division in the\r\nTahure sector on January 10 and went to the vicinity of Vouziers, where\r\nit was intensively trained in open warfare.\r\n\r\n2. Early in March it returned to line and relieved the 52d Division. It\r\nwas relieved on the 23d of April by the 1st Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n3. It proceeded to march to Vouziers, where it entrained on the 28th\r\nand, traveling via Mezières-Signy-Hirson-Mons-Tournai, detrained at\r\nMouscron on the 30th. On May 4 it marched to Wervicq, and on the\r\nfollowing day moved into line via Warneton and Messines, relieving the\r\n3d Guard Division in the Voormezeele sector (south of Ypres). In the\r\nfighting before Dickebusch on the 8th heavy losses were suffered. It was\r\nwithdrawn about the 25th, and went to rest near Menin.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of the 13th–14th of June it relieved the 58th\r\nDivision near Locre (south of Ypres). It was relieved on the 1st of\r\nJuly, the flanking divisions extending their fronts, and went to rest in\r\nthe region southwest of Courtrai.\r\n\r\n5. On the 6th of August it came back into line, relieving the 58th\r\nDivision in the Kemmel sector (south of Ypres). It was withdrawn about\r\nthe 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. About the 2d of September it reenforced the front in the Bertincourt\r\nsector (east of Bapaume). After having suffered severe losses in killed\r\nand wounded, besides losing over 1,000 prisoners, it was relieved by the\r\n6th Division near Havrincourt on the 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURTRAI.\r\n\r\n7. About the 27th it entered line near Moorslede (southwest of Roulers).\r\nIt suffered severe losses here, and was withdrawn early in October.\r\n\r\n8. On October 14 it relieved the Guard Ersatz Division in the Iseghem\r\nsector (north of Courtrai). It was heavily engaged here, and was finally\r\nwithdrawn on the 25th. It did not reenter line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 52d was rated as a second-class division, but it was probably not so\r\ngood as other divisions similarly rated, for although it was intensively\r\ntrained for use as a shock unit for almost two months in Champagne early\r\nin the year it was not used in any of the German offensives. It is to be\r\nnoted, however, that the German communique of October 24 said,\r\n“Southwest of Deynze the veteran 52d Reserve Division, which has been in\r\nbattle daily since October 14, repulsed the renewed attacks of the enemy\r\nalong the Deynze-Waregem railway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         53d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │105 Res. │241 Res. │105 Res. │241 Res. │105 Res. │241 Res.\r\n              │         │242 Res. │         │242 Res. │         │243 Res.\r\n              │106 Res. │243 Res. │106 Res. │243 Res. │106 Res. │242 Res.\r\n              │         │244 Res. │         │244 Res. │         │244 Res.\r\n              │  25 Res.

The 53d Reserve Division (of the 27th Reserve Corps with the 54th\r\nReserve Division), formed between August and October, 1914, were sent to\r\nBelgium, and detrained on August 14 at Ath. It was engaged, with the\r\ndivisions of the same series, in the battle of Ypres, against the\r\nBritish Army. Beginning on October 21, it fought on the front\r\nPoelcappelle-Becelaere; southeast of Gheluvelt on October 29, and near\r\nthe Ypres-Menin road at the time of the great attack of November 11. It\r\nsuffered very heavy losses—the 25th Reserve Chasseurs Battalion, already\r\nreduced to 225 men on October 31, had only 73 on November 4 (notebook).\r\nOn November 25 the 6th Company of the 241st Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\nhad only 7 of the men left who constituted it upon its departure from\r\nSaxony (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line north of Ypres during the winter of\r\n1914–15, alternating with the 54th Reserve Division in the sector\r\nBroodseinde-Polygon wood.\r\n\r\n2. It took part in the second battle of Ypres, near Frezenberg and\r\nGravenstafel, where it again lost heavily.\r\n\r\n3. In June it occupied the sector of Wytchaete-St. Éloi and returned\r\nnortheast of Ypres (Verlorenhoek) in the middle of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE AND FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October the 105th Reserve Brigade was sent to\r\nChampagne to reenforce the lines near Tahure. The 106th Reserve Brigade\r\ntook over the sector of the Lys.\r\n\r\n5. In November the division was regrouped and sent to rest in the\r\nvicinity of Ingelmunster (north of Courtrai). It remained behind the\r\nfront during the winter of 1915–16 in the vicinity of Roulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of March, 1916, the 53d Reserve Division left Flanders and\r\nwent into line on both banks of the La Bassee Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to the Somme at the end of August, it was engaged southeast of\r\nMaurepas (Le Forest) at the time of the French attack of September 3,\r\nwhich ended in the capture of Le Forest and of Clery. It suffered heavy\r\nlosses in counterattacking and in withstanding the new French offensive\r\nof September 13. Between September 6 and 12 the 241st Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment listed 12 officers and 1,502 men as casualties. On September 3\r\nthe 244th Reserve Infantry Regiment had lost 400 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOS.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved on September 14, it was transferred to the Loos front\r\n(between Hulluch and the Lens-Béthune railroad), from September 21 to\r\nOctober 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. On October 9 it was in Champagne, where it occupied the sector of\r\nProsnes, east of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from the Champagne front, the 53d Reserve Division\r\nentrained for the Eastern Front on November 17. (Itinerary:\r\nBétheniville-Rethel-Sedan-Trèves-Coblenz-Ems-Cologne-Halle-Cottbus-\r\nLiegnitz-Breslau-Cracow-Tarnow-Jaroslaw-Przemysl-Lemberg-Rohatyn.) It\r\ndetrained at Pukow (south of Lemberg) on the 26th.\r\n\r\n6. It was sent into reserve behind the line of the Narajowka in\r\nDecember. In the autumn of 1916 the 244th Reserve Infantry Regiment was\r\ntransferred to the 215th Division; later it was transferred to the 96th\r\nDivision (Saxon).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1917, the 53d Reserve Division went into\r\nline at the junction of the Narajowka and the Dniester, and remained in\r\nthis sector until the middle of June without any important engagement.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved and sent to rest in June, it took part in the German\r\ncounteroffensive begun on July 20 and advanced north of the Dniester. It\r\nwas identified on August 3 east of Krjivtche.\r\n\r\n3. The division was withdrawn from the front at the end of November and\r\nentrained for Belgium in the middle of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 53d Reserve Division is purely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 53d Reserve Division spent a year on the Eastern Front (November,\r\n1916, to November, 1917). It is of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Houthulst forest on February 12 and\r\nwent to rest in the Bruges area.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On March 1–2 it relieved the 27th Division northeast of Flesquieres.\r\nIt took part in the initial attack on March 21, was withdrawn on the 22d\r\nand went to rest near Bourlon wood. The division was in General\r\nHeadquarters reserve and on March 27 marched via Havrincourt-\r\nRuyaulcourt-Moislains-Bouchavesnes, crossing the Somme at Clery, and\r\ncontinued to march via Raincourt to Rosieres en Santerre. The 241st\r\nReserve Regiment went into line near Moreuil on the night of April 1–2\r\nand relieved the 426th Regiment (88th Division); the 242d Reserve\r\nRegiment went into line on the night of April 3–4, relieving the 100th\r\nBody Grenadier Regiment (23d Division). On the morning of April 4 the\r\ndivision attacked in the vicinity of Arriese Cour wood. The division at\r\nthis date was operating under the 18th German Army. About the middle of\r\nApril it was withdrawn from the Moreuil sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. About May 1 the division was resting in rear of the Verdun front. It\r\nrelieved the 84th Division west of Bethincourt in the first week of May.\r\nIt held that quiet sector until the 11th of June, when a tired division\r\ntook its place and the 53d Reserve Division returned to an active front.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n4. The division detrained near Laon on June 14–15, and the next night\r\nrelieved the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division north of Le Port. Here it\r\nparticipated in heavy fighting in July and August until its relief about\r\nAugust 10. In this engagement the 243d Reserve Regiment was reduced to\r\nthree companies per battalion as a result of heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. The division was taken to the region in rear of the Argonne front and\r\nthe process of dissolution begun. Before its completion the American\r\noffensive in the Argonne began and elements of the division were used on\r\nthe United States front between September 29 and October 15.\r\n\r\nAccording to the available evidence, the 242d Reserve Regiment was\r\ndrafted to the 24th and 58th Divisions, the 241st Regiment to the 23d\r\nDivision, and the 243d Reserve Regiment to the 40th and 58th Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It participated in the spring\r\nSomme offensive, but thereafter did not play an important part in the\r\nfighting. The low effective strength was directly responsible for the\r\ndissolution of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             54th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │108.          │27 Res.       │108.          │84.\r\n              │              │90 Res.       │              │27 Res.\r\n              │              │84.           │              │90 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │             (?)             │17 Hus.

The 54th Division was formed in March, 1915, by the removal of\r\nregiments from divisions engaged at this time between the north of Noyon\r\nand east of Soissons.\r\n\r\nTwo of these regiments, the 84th (18th Division) and the 90th Reserve\r\n(18th Reserve Division), came from the 9th Corps District (Schleswig-\r\nHolstein and Mecklenburg); the third regiment, the 27th Reserve (7th\r\nReserve Division) was originally from Prussian Saxony (4th Corps\r\nDistrict).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated in March near Guise, the 54th Division was sent to\r\nChampagne in the middle of April (vicinity of Perthes), where it\r\nremained until July, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. In July it was transferred to Russia. It fought on the Narew (July\r\nand August) and on the Niemen, southeast of Grodno, in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE-OISE.\r\n\r\n4. Brought back to France at the beginning of October, it went into line\r\non the 12th on the left bank of the Oise (Quennevières-Moulin sous\r\nTouvent).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Oise front in January, 1916, the 54th Division\r\nrested in the vicinity of La Fère until May. During this time it was\r\noccupied in defensive works in the vicinity of Soissons-Craonne.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. In May it was transferred to Verdun. It occupied the sector of Hill\r\n304 on May 14.\r\n\r\n3. About September 11 it crossed to the right bank of the Meuse and\r\nadvanced north of Fleury. On October 24 it was dislodged by the French\r\nattacks and thrown back with heavy losses north of Douaumont Fort. It\r\nwas relieved at the beginning of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. Having scarcely made good its losses, it went back into line on\r\nNovember 5 north of Flirey en Haye.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in the calm sector of Flirey during the winter\r\nof 1916–17.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved in the middle of April, 1917, it was sent behind the\r\nChampagne front (vicinity of Asfeld). On April 21 it reenforced the\r\nlines at Berry au Bac. It underwent the French attack of May 4, to which\r\nit opposed a serious resistance on the Juvincourt Ridge, but suffered\r\nheavy losses (650 prisoners).\r\n\r\n3. It was withdrawn from the Aisne front on May 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to the east of Rheims, the division occupied the sector south of\r\nSomme Py from May 15 to July 24. It was filled up there in June by\r\nseveral reenforcements, totaling about 2,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n5. On July 25 it entrained at Machault (southwest of Vouziers) for\r\nCharleville, from which place it went to Belgium after a short rest. It\r\nwas in action east of Ypres from August 5 to 19, and suffered new losses\r\nduring the British attack of August 16. One company of the 90th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment was reduced to one officer and four men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. Sent back into line at the end of August on the Cambrai front\r\n(Havrincourt-Villers Plouich), the division again lost very heavily in\r\nthis sector, principally in the course of a tank attack on November 20\r\n(2,789 prisoners).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved immediately after this attack, it was sent to rest in\r\nLorraine and reorganized. Between August and November the division\r\nreceived more than 3,000 replacements. (British Summary of Information.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed upon its formation (Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, Prussian\r\nSaxony,) the 54th Division remained so with a tendency, nevertheless, to\r\nmake the 90th Reserve Infantry Regiment a pure Mecklenburg regiment and\r\nto reserve the drafts from the rest of the 9th Corps District for the\r\n84th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\nIn January 1918, the 1919 class did not seem to be represented; the 90th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment had just received replacements made up of men\r\nput back in the 1917 and 1918 classes who entered the service in\r\nSeptember, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 54th Division held the most active sectors on the Western front; it\r\nhas everywhere given proof of great energy in its resistance, especially\r\nat Cambrai in November, 1917. However, before the affair of Cambrai\r\nrather frequent desertions proved that the losses incurred at Ypres had\r\nweakened the morale of the troops; besides, the replacements received in\r\nLorraine were mostly composed of returned wounded of all ages.\r\n\r\nHowever, the 54th Division tried, during its stay in Lorraine, to\r\namalgamate all these elements and to renew their combat value by\r\nintensive training and careful instruction (March, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\nThe division was relieved in the sector north of Nancy about February 17\r\nby the 48th Landwehr Division. It remained in Lorraine in March\r\nundergoing training for open warfare. It entrained near Dieuze on the\r\n24th and traveled via Metz-Sedan-Charleville-Mons-Valenciennes to a\r\nplace about 10 miles east of Douai. The division expected to come into\r\nline near Arras, but after resting one night at Douai it marched off\r\ntoward Peronne and arrived at Rosieres on April 2. It moved up to the\r\nline north of Moreuil on the night of April 3–4, taking part in the\r\nattack. The division withdrew on the night of the 5th–6th. It returned\r\nto line south of Thennes on April 10 and stayed in about eight days.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested at Cambrai until the night of May 22–23, when it\r\nrelieved the 183d Division near Ville sur Ancre. It was relieved on June\r\n20 by the 107th Division. Following its relief, the division rested\r\nnorth of the Somme until August 3, when it was engaged near Antheuil.\r\nAbout September 1 the division left its sector near Lassigny and\r\nrelieved the 105th Division northeast of Noyon. Here it was relieved on\r\nSeptember 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI-ST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested 15 days before it entered line northeast of\r\nHargicourt on September 25, relieving the 232d Division. It fought in\r\nthe Le Cateau area until October 12, when it retired to reserves in the\r\nvicinity of Landrecies. On November 2 it was reengaged at Ors and\r\ncontinued in line until the armistice. The last identification was at\r\nLemont-Fontaine on the 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. In the last year its service was\r\nlargely on the defensive in active sectors. In this capacity it was\r\nalmost constantly in line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         54th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1914        │       1915        │       1916\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │107 Res. │245 Res. │107 Res. │245 Res. │107 Res. │245 Res.\r\n              │         │246 Res. │         │246 Res. │         │247 Res.\r\n              │108 Res. │247 Res. │108 Res. │247 Res. │108 Res. │246 Res.\r\n              │         │248 Res. │         │248 Res. │         │248 Res.\r\n              │ 26 Res.

The 54th Reserve Division, forming the 27th Reserve Corps with the\r\n53d Reserve Division, was formed of men from Wurttemberg, with the\r\naddition of one infantry regiment and one battalion of chasseurs from\r\nSaxony. Trained at the Muensingen Camp, it went into action for the\r\nfirst time on October 21, 1914, in Belgium at the battle of Ypres. On\r\nOctober 29, it made an unsuccessful attack south of Gheluvelt, going\r\nslightly to the north, it took part in the general attack of November 11\r\nin the vicinity of Zonnebeke, where it lost very heavily. From October\r\n21 to November 20 the 248th Reserve Infantry Regiment listed 32 officers\r\nand 1,395 men as casualties. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1915.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in Flanders during the entire year of 1915,\r\noccupying the front Becelaere-Polygon wood, between the Ypres-Menin wood\r\nand the Roulers railroad.\r\n\r\n2. In April and May it suffered heavy losses during the second battle of\r\nYpres (Frezenberg, Verlorenhoek, Hooge).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January and beginning of February, 1916, the 54th\r\nReserve Division was withdrawn from the Ypres salient, concentrated in\r\nthe vicinity of Thielt, Ghent, and Hasselt and sent for training to the\r\nBeverloo Camp (February-March).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of March it took over the sector south of Neuve\r\nChapelle (north of La Bassée) where it did not take part in any\r\nimportant action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the end of August, it was sent to the Somme (sector of\r\nCombles-La Forest) and suffered very heavy losses between September 8\r\nand 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. After a short stay in the Loos salient (Vermelles-Hulluch road) at\r\nthe beginning of October the 54th Reserve Division was transferred to\r\nLorraine and sent into line in the vicinity of Blamont.\r\n\r\n5. At this time, the 245th Reserve Infantry Regiment (Saxon) was taken\r\nfrom it to be assigned to the 192d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n6. At the end of November the division left Lorraine, was sent during\r\nthe course of December behind the front northwest of Cambrai, then to\r\nthe Meuse, where it went into line on December 22, west of Bezonvaux\r\n(Les Chambrettes), after the French attack of December 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. Withdrawn from the Verdun front about January 23, 1917, the 54th\r\nReserve Division took over, in Champagne, the sector included between\r\nthe Navarin Farm and the Tahure Hill.\r\n\r\n2. In March it sent one battalion of the 246th Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\ninto the attacks of Maisons de Champagne on March 27.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of May the division went as a reenforcement south of\r\nMoronvilliers. It went into action from May 15 to June 10 (Téton, Mont\r\nHaut) and lost heavily.\r\n\r\n4. About June 10–15, without any rest, it again took over the sector\r\nwest of Tahure, which it occupied until August 20–25.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILL 304.\r\n\r\n5. Suddenly transferred to the Verdun area, the 54th Reserve Division\r\nwent into line on August 24, north of Hill 304; it remained there until\r\nOctober 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. Sent to Flanders, it was in the Dixmude sector from October 29 until\r\nMarch 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed at the time of its formation, the 54th Reserve Division became\r\nexclusively Wurttemberg, by the departure of its Saxon elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nSince the number of prisoners of the 54th Reserve Division in Champagne,\r\nas in the vicinity of Verdun, March to October 1917, was very slight, it\r\nhas been practically impossible to obtain information concerning this\r\ndivision (November 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division which had been holding the Dixmude sector entrained at\r\nBruges on March 14, and detrained at Cambrai on the following day. On\r\nMarch 20 it marched to Seranvillers, and a day later proceeded via\r\nLesdain to the high ground west of Honnecourt. On the 22d it reached\r\nGouzeaucourt; on the 23d it passed through Lechelle, Bus, and Sailly\r\nSaillisel; on the 24th it progressed north of Mametz wood, being engaged\r\nnear Rozieres on the 25th and at Ovillers on the 26th. The division was\r\nrelieved on April 4 by the 27th Division after suffering heavy losses at\r\nAveluy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The division was in reserve in immediate rear of the front until the\r\nnight of April 10–11, when it relieved the 13th Division at Ville sur\r\nAncre. The division held this sector until May 27 and again from June 28\r\nuntil August 25. It was withdrawn in the Mametz area where it had fallen\r\nback upon the British attack.\r\n\r\n3. Early in September the division was dissolved. Prisoners stated that\r\nthe 248th Reserve Regiment was drafted to the 27th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class.

In May, 1917, the 35th Fusileer Regiment was replaced by the\r\n186th Infantry Regiment (from the 25th Landwehr Division) recruited from\r\nHesse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. Concentrated in March, 1915, near Vouziers, the 56th Division went to\r\nthe Champagne front, south of Ripont, in April.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of May it was transferred to the Eastern Front. It\r\ntook part in the Galician offensive (battles of Jaroslau, on May 18, and\r\nof Rudka, on June 18), where it lost heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. In June the division was brought back to the Western Front.\r\nEntraining at Jaroslau on June 28, it detrained in the vicinity of\r\nValenciennes, where it remained at rest for a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. On July 28 the division went to Lorraine and remained as a reserve\r\ntroop in the vicinity of Pfalzburg-Zabern-Schirmeck.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 25 it was sent to Champagne to oppose the French\r\noffensive. It was engaged in the sector of Maison de Champagne, but was\r\nsoon retired on account of its losses. The infantry had casualties of\r\n107 officers and 5,968 men. (Official List of Casualties.)\r\n\r\n6. After reorganization, it went into line north of Massiges and took\r\npart in the attack of Mont Têtu at the beginning of November. It was\r\nrelieved in the middle of November.\r\n\r\n7. In December it returned to the Champagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. The 56th Division occupied the same calm sector south of Rouvroy\r\nduring the entire winter of 1915–16.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved on April 25, 1916, it was sent to rest in the vicinity of\r\nSedan.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN (MORT-HOMME).\r\n\r\n3. On May 26–27 it was sent into line on the left bank of the Meuse, at\r\nthe Mort Homme. It received a vigorous attack there on May 31, had heavy\r\nlosses, and continued to hold this sector until the middle of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. After a short rest in the vicinity of Sedan, it went to the Vimy\r\nRidge, in Artois (end of July-end of August).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. On August 24–25 it was engaged in the battle of the Somme, in\r\nBelleville wood. On August 31 it launched a counterattack northeast of\r\nthe wood. It left the Somme on September 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. It then took over a quiet sector east of Rheims at Cernay-La\r\nPompelle. In the middle of November it returned to the Somme front (Pys)\r\nuntil January 7, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 56th Division was sent to rest in the vicinity\r\nof St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME-HINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n2. About February 11 it went back into line south of the Somme in the\r\nvicinity of Biaches, retired at the end of March to the north of St.\r\nQuentin, and from there went to Courrieres in the vicinity of the Lens\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n3. On April 10 it took over the sector of Lens, where it suffered\r\nimportant losses from raids and local conflicts. It absorbed 1,000 men\r\nfrom the 624th Infantry Regiment, dissolved, and some from the 625th\r\n(Hessian).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (RIGHT BANK).\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the Lens front at the end of June, it remained at rest\r\nin the vicinity of Buzancy and Grandpré in July, near Carignan, at the\r\nbeginning of August; spent the second half of August in the Woevre,\r\nreenforcing the Verdun front east of Vaux. In September it occupied the\r\nsector north of the Chaume wood-Baumont, where it was relieved at the\r\nend of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (LEFT BANK).\r\n\r\n5. About November 10 the 56th Division occupied the sector of Cheppy\r\nwood, on the left bank of the Meuse, where it remained until March 20,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSince the substitution of the 186th Infantry Regiment for the 35th\r\nFusileers, the division has become entirely Hessian. By analogy with the\r\n9th Landwehr Division, we sometimes find it designated as “Rhine\r\ntroops”; the Rhine Provinces in general cooperate with Hesse and Hesse-\r\nNassau in sending its replacements.\r\n\r\nIn the first months of 1918 the reenforcements received comprised men\r\nfrom the 3d and 4th Corps Districts (Berlin and Silesia) belonging to\r\nthe industrial classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nHaving suffered heavily in the Galician campaign in 1915, and in\r\nChampagne and at Verdun, the 56th Division had serious losses at Lens\r\nbetween April and June, 1917. The 186th Infantry Regiment had heavy\r\nlosses during the battle of the Aisne (April, 1917) before joining the\r\n56th Division. The division had few losses on the left bank of the Meuse\r\nfrom January to March, 1918.\r\n\r\nOf 84 prisoners coming from three regiments of the 56th Division,\r\ncaptured on March 16 and 17, 1918, more than half belong either to the\r\nactive or to the reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved west of the Meuse about March 19 by an\r\nextension of the front of the 13th Reserve Division and underwent a\r\ncourse of training for open warfare. At this time the companies had\r\nabout 180 to 200 effectives. It had no men of the 1919 class and few\r\nAlsatians or Poles. The quality of men in the division was high. On\r\nApril 18 the division entrained at Cesse (northwest of Stenay) and\r\ntraveled via Sedan-Dinant-Charleroi-Braine le Comte-Tournai-Roubaix,\r\nfrom where it marched to Croix. On the 21st the 118th Regiment proceeded\r\nvia Mouveaux-Bondues-Roucq to Halluin, where it rested until the 23d. On\r\nthe following day the regiment marched via Wervicq-Comines to Messines.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEMMEL.\r\n\r\n2. The division came into line on the 25th and captured the village of\r\nKemmel. It was engaged in this vicinity until May 2, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 29th Division, and went to rest in the area north of\r\nMenin. It returned to line on the night of May 11–12, relieving the 13th\r\nReserve Division on the Voormezeele sector. The division remained in\r\nline South of Ypres until the night of June 3–4.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n3. After its relief the division rested in the Bruges area until its\r\nreturn to line northeast of Bailleul on July 2. From then until October\r\n19 the division remained in line on this front. It had fallen back east\r\nof Roubaix when it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n4. After several days in reserve the division was again in line near St.\r\nGenois. The German communiqué of October 26 praised the fighting of the\r\n118th Regiment. The last identification of the division was on November\r\n8, when it was east of Avelghem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was very actively engaged\r\nduring almost the entire last year of the war on the British front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             58th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │116.          │106.          │116.          │106.\r\n              │              │107.          │              │107.\r\n              │              │120 Res.      │              │120 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 18 Uhlan Rgt.         │2 Sqn. 18 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │58 Brig.:                    │58 Brig.:\r\n              │ 115 F.

At the\r\nend of 1916 the last-named regiment was replaced by the 103d Reserve\r\nRegiment (Saxon). The provincial homogeneity is thus realized.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained at Roulers until the beginning of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. On May 12, 1915, the 58th Division took part in the battle of Artois\r\n(Carency, May 12–15) and suffered heavy losses. On May 12 and 14 the 1st\r\nBattalion of the 106th Infantry Regiment had casualties of 22 officers\r\nand 642 men. (Official List of Casualties.) The casualties of the\r\ndivision amounted to 116 officers and 4,194 men.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of June the division fought at Neuville St. Vaast\r\n(Le Labyrinthe.)\r\n\r\n4. It was at rest in the middle of June in the vicinity of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n5. On July 21 the division was transferred to Russia. (Itinerary:\r\nRoubaix-Sedan-Longwy-Thionville-Trèves-Coblentz-Cassel-Berlin-\r\nMarienburg-Koenigsberg-Loetzen.)\r\n\r\n6. It took part in the offensive against the Russians in August and\r\nSeptember (Narew, Bobr, Bielostok, Vilna) as far as Lake Narotch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n7. Brought back to France between October 16 and 22 (Itinerary: Vilna-\r\nKovno-Koenigsberg-Berlin-Hanover-Cassel-Frankfort-Mayence-Coblentz-\r\nTrèves-Sarrebreucken), it took over a sector in Lorraine (Leintrey-\r\nDomèvre) in November and December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In January and February, 1916, the 58th Division was at rest in the\r\nvicinity of Sarreburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. About February 25 it returned to the sector of Leintrey-Embermenil\r\nand remained there until the middle of March. It celebrated its first\r\nanniversary there—150 days of fighting, 1,200 kilometers on foot, 4,400\r\nby railroad (notebook).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. Brought back to Verdun at this time, it took part in the attack of\r\nCaillette wood, near Douaumont, on April 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division was withdrawn from the Verdun front about April 7 and\r\nsent to rest in the vicinity of Rethel. On April 30 it went to\r\nChampagne, where it occupied the sector east of Rheims (Bétheny-Cernay,\r\nLa Pompelle).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. In September the division was engaged on the Somme (Barleux). The 2d\r\nCompany of the 20th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 177 strong, was\r\ndestroyed, with the exception of 22 prisoners.\r\n\r\n6. After occupying a calm sector on the Yser from September 29 to\r\nOctober 23, it again fought on the Somme (Courcelette-Grandcourt) in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n7. On December 20 the division was withdrawn and reorganized—the 120th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment left the division for the 204th Division, a\r\nnew formation, and went to Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. In January and February, 1917, the 58th Division became exclusively\r\nSaxon (106th, 107th, 103d Reserve Infantry Regiments). It went to the\r\nVerdun front and remained to the end of March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. The latter part of March it went into line at Auberive, and suffered\r\nheavy losses in the attack of April 16–17. Because of these losses, the\r\n8th Company of the 103d Infantry Regiment required a minimum\r\nreenforcement of 70 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-LAKE NAROTCH.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about April 20, the 58th Division entrained on the 24th for\r\nRussia. (Itinerary: Coblentz-Giessen-Halle-Lissa-Lodz-Warsaw-Brest-\r\nLitowsk (Apr. 28).) It held the sector south of Lake Narotch from the\r\nbeginning of May until the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n4. On October 6 it was brought back to France. (Itinerary: Vilna-\r\nKoenigsberg-Luebeck-Hamburg-Crefeld-Aix la Chapelle-Liége-Ghent-Bruges-\r\nThourout (Oct. 11).)\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUTHULST WOOD.\r\n\r\n5. On October 17 it took over the sector south of Houthulst wood and\r\nreceived the attack of October 22; it was relieved on the 24th.\r\n\r\n6. On October 31 it again occupied the sector which it left at the end\r\nof November.\r\n\r\n7. It spent December at rest in the vicinity of Bruges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nMixed at the beginning (Saxon and Wurttemberg), like the 54th Reserve\r\nDivision, the division became homogeneous by exchanging its Wurttemberg\r\ntroops for Saxon units.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nWhen the 58th Division was on the Russian front, a division school was\r\nformed in the month of June, 1917, with the purpose of teaching men the\r\nmethod of attack.\r\n\r\nThe division school was dissolved a few days before the departure for\r\nRussia. As soon as they arrived on the Western Front it was made an\r\nassault detachment of the division.\r\n\r\nOn the Flanders front the 58th Division did not show any high combat\r\nvalue. Rather frequent cases of abandoning the front line have been\r\nproved (October, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. About April 3 the division extended its left flank and relieved the\r\n38th Division. At that time the division was holding two divisional\r\nsectors. About May 19, it was relieved by the 49th Reserve Division and\r\nmoved to the Locre sector where it relieved the 31st Division a day\r\nlater. This sector was held by the division until the night of June\r\n13–14 when it was relieved by the 52d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n2. It rested in the Courtrai area until July 7 when it returned to line\r\nwest of Dranoutre in relief of the 121st Division. The 52d Reserve\r\nDivision again relieved it on August 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained at Menin on August 25 and detrained at\r\nSancourt on the evening of the 26th coming into line on August 28 near\r\nHardecourt and Bullecourt. It sideslipped south about the 1st of\r\nSeptember and replaced the 52d Division which had been withdrawn. About\r\nSeptember 10 the division was withdrawn from the battle front after\r\nsuffering heavy losses. About this time the regiments of the division\r\nwere reduced to two battalions of three companies each.\r\n\r\n4. On September 27, the division relieved the 39th Division north of\r\nEcourt-St. Quentin. It retreated by Arleux to a point west of\r\nValenciennes where it was relieved about October 22. Two days later it\r\ncame into line farther south at Ghent and fought until November 7. The\r\nfinal identifications were at Hecq (Nov. 4), north of Berlaimont (Nov.\r\n5) and north of Pont-sur-Sambre (Nov. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as a strong\r\ndefensive division exclusively on the British front during 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         75th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │75 Res.       │249 Res.      │75 Res.       │249 Res.\r\n              │              │250 Res.      │              │250 Res.\r\n              │              │251 Res.      │              │251 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │75 Res.

The 75th Reserve Division, trained at the Heuberg Camp in Baden,\r\nincluded two regiments of the 14th Corps District and one from the 11th\r\nCorps District. The first two were formed from the six field battalions\r\nfrom Baden, Nos. 61 to 66; the third, from three Thuringian field\r\nbattalions, Nos. 58 to 60.\r\n\r\n2. Forming a part of the 38th Reserve Corps with the 76th Reserve\r\nDivision, it was sent to the Eastern Front at the end of January, 1915.\r\n\r\n3. On February 17 it was in the vicinity of Augustowo, after taking part\r\nin the battle of Mazurian Lakes, where it lost heavily (250th Reserve\r\nInfantry Regiment).\r\n\r\n4. At the end of February and the beginning of March it occupied the\r\nfront near Chtabin.\r\n\r\n5. On March 9 it attacked north of Ostrolenka and marched to Ossowiec.\r\nIt remained in the region north of Ostrolenka until the end of April.\r\n\r\n6. In the summer, it took part in the march upon Vilna and advanced\r\nbeyond this by way of Wileisk (Sept. 24), south of Lake Drisviaty (Oct.\r\n6).\r\n\r\n7. At the end of October, the 75th Reserve Division went somewhat to the\r\nsouth and took over the sector of Spiagla, south of Lake Narotch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE NAROTCH.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line in the vicinity of Lake Narotch until\r\nthe end of July, 1916. In the spring of 1916, it received the Russian\r\noffensive in this area.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of August, it was transferred to the Stokhod. We\r\nfind it southwest of Sviniouki on October 1; south of Kisselin on\r\nNovember 9 (except the 251st Reserve Infantry Regiment sent to Galicia\r\non Oct. 30).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of November, the entire division was in Galicia, where it\r\noccupied the sector of the Narajowka (north of Halicz, Rohatyn).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 75th Reserve Division was retained in the vicinity of Halicz, and\r\nof Brzezany until July, 1917 (in reserve from the end of March to the\r\nend of May).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n2. On July 25 the division left Galicia to go to Smorgoni, from which\r\nplace it was transferred to the Riga sector (Uxkull) at the end of\r\nAugust. After the taking of Riga, it advanced beyond the Dvina and took\r\nup its position on the Meloupe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. On December 1 the division entrained for France. (Itinerary: Riga-\r\nMitau-Kovno-Marienburg-Berlin-Hanover-Cassel-Cologne-Coblentz-Trèves-\r\nThionville-Metz-Charleville-Hirson-Vervins.) It detrained at St. Gobert\r\nand Vervins about December 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to rest near Vervins, about December 26, the division took over\r\nthe sector of Chavignon-Urcel on the 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe divisions formed in 1915 were not homogeneous. The 75th Reserve\r\nDivision consists of two regiments from Baden and one from the\r\nElectorate of Hesse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nSince the 75th Reserve Division comes from Russia and has only been on\r\nthe French front since the end of December 1917, it is difficult to form\r\na judgment as to the combat value of this organization.\r\n\r\nAt the end of December elements of the division took part in maneuvers\r\nsupported by tanks (at Voulpaix, west of Verdun). (Interrogation of\r\nprisoner, Feb. 20, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February the 251st Reserve Infantry Regiment took\r\npart in a division maneuver in which the infantry had to fight simulated\r\ntanks. (Interrogation of prisoner, Mar. 11, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that during the trip from Russia to France 40 men\r\nbelonging to the Minenwerfer and pioneer companies, were reported\r\nmissing. (Interrogation of prisoner, Jan. 31, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved south of Laon on March 26 and went to Laon.\r\nBy way of Champignon (west of Crepy), Charmes, it marched to Chauny,\r\nwhere it went into line on March 30. It was engaged until about April\r\n14, and then went to rest north of St. Gobain.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MATZ.\r\n\r\n2. It returned to line southeast of Canny sur Matz on the night of May\r\n16–17 and took part in the battle of Noyon in June. It was relieved\r\nabout June 20 and rested until July 2. It was in line at Courcelles from\r\nthat date until August 18. Prior to the French attack on August 18, the\r\ndivision counted about 3,000 combatants. It suffered important losses\r\nbetween the 8th and 18th.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in the Bois de Champien and Bois de Glandon until\r\nAugust 23 and then in the Bois du Tunnel. On the 27th it went to Ham. On\r\nthe night of August 31-September 1 it relieved the 1st Reserve Division\r\nin the sector Libermont-Bois du Tunnel. It fell back across the Canal du\r\nNord on September 3 and continued its retreat through Sommette, Dury,\r\nBray St. Christophe until it reached a position at Happencourt on\r\nSeptember 7. It was relieved on the 13th by the 22d Reserve Division.\r\nThe attack of August and September had completely disorganized the\r\ndivision and greatly reduced its morale.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE CATEAU.\r\n\r\n4. The division returned to line west of Bellenglise on September 20 and\r\nwas heavily engaged for 10 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n5. On November 10 the division came into line near Jametz on the\r\nAmerican front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Throughout 1918 its morale\r\nappears to have been low, and after the battle of Matz its effectives\r\nwere greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         76th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │76 Res.       │252 Res.      │76 Res.       │252 Res.\r\n              │              │253 Res.      │              │253 Res.\r\n              │              │254 Res.      │              │254 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │76 Res.

The 76th Reserve Division (included in the 38th Reserve Corps with\r\nthe 75th Reserve Division), formed in January, 1915, grows out of three\r\nfield battalions (Feld bataillone), Nos. 55–57 of the 11th Corps\r\nDistrict, and out of six field battalions, Nos. 67–72 of the 18th Corps\r\nDistrict. It was sent toward Russia at the beginning of February, 1915.\r\n\r\n2. On February 13 it was identified in the region of Gumbinnen. It was\r\nreally part of the group which operated in the region of Wylkowyszki-\r\nMariampol.\r\n\r\n3. On March 2 it was on the Sopotzkyn-Chtabin front.\r\n\r\n4. In March it was northeast of Prasnysz.\r\n\r\n5. In April it was in the region of Suwalki-Augustowo.\r\n\r\n6. In May it was north of Suwalki.\r\n\r\n7. On June 23 the 76th Reserve Division went to the Dubissa area.\r\n\r\n8. On June 30, region of Eydtkuhnen.\r\n\r\n9. The summer offensive of 1915 brought it, through the region of Vilna,\r\nto Kovno (Aug. 16) and then to the south of Smorgoni (Oct. 6–10).\r\n\r\nIt was withdrawn from the front about October 15 and was at Vilna on\r\nNovember 1 and in the region of Mitau on December 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1.

The division was moved to the Western Front in the spring after\r\nexchanging its older men for younger men from the divisions remaining in\r\nRoumania. It entrained at Focsani on March 7 and traveled by way of\r\nHermannstadt, Budapest, Breslau, Erfurt, Fulda, to Metz, where it\r\ndetrained on March 15. The 254th Reserve Regiment was in cantonments a\r\nfew days at Fort Luitpold and then went to Norroy le Veneur where it\r\nremained about 12 days. It entrained on March 31 and proceeded by way of\r\nSedan and Charleville to Hirson (Apr. 1). From there it marched via\r\nRemigny-Golancourt-Roye-Narvillers-Hangest-Plessier-Rozainvillers, where\r\nit went into cantonments for three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. On the night of April 12–13 the division relieved elements of the 23d\r\nDivision between Malpart and La Chappelle-St. Aignan. About May 2 the\r\ndivision extended its front to the north and relieved a part of the\r\n240th Division. This was a defensive sector at this time. On May 9 the\r\nFrench made an attack on Grivesnes Park while the 76th Reserve Division\r\nwas holding it. The attack was a complete surprise and caused many\r\ncasualties. Between April 10 and May 8 the losses averaged 30 to 35 men\r\nper company and the number of combatants on May 9 was about 75 per\r\ncompany. It was relieved in the middle of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n3. The division entered line in the Verdun region to the south of\r\nBezonvaux on June 21. It was withdrawn from the quiet sector in mid-\r\nJuly, and on the 29th relieved the 46th Reserve Division southwest of\r\nSoissons. Until August 2 it was not involved in the attack. It defended\r\nthe flanks of the German retreat energetically until its withdrawal on\r\nSeptember 8. A week later its regiments were used singly to support the\r\nunits in line in delaying the French advance on the line Coucy le\r\nChateau-Ferny-Sorny. The losses in the fighting were considerable,\r\nincluding 575 prisoners. It showed itself a good defensive division.\r\n\r\n4. On September 25 the division came in line on the extreme left of the\r\nAmerican line in the Argonne. On October 10 all three regiments were\r\nopposite the United States troops in Grandpre. It remained in line until\r\nNovember 8 before it was finally withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe excessive use of the division gave rise to serious internal\r\ndiscontent. The rifle strength of the regiments was down to less than\r\n300 by October 24, and the troops were demanding a rest. Some companies\r\nrefused to enter the line in mid-October. The divisional commander was\r\nobliged to issue an appeal to the division on October 21 to hold out.\r\nThe entire rifle strength of the 2d Battalion, 254th Reserve Regiment,\r\nwas but 3 officers and 75 men on October 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. As a defensive sector holding\r\nunit the division showed a power of sustained resistance that warranted\r\na higher classification. By the end the division had been completely\r\nused up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         77th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │77 Res.       │255 Res.      │77 Res.       │255 Res.\r\n              │              │256 Res.      │              │256 Res.\r\n              │              │257 Res.      │              │257 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │77 Res.

With the 78th\r\nReserve Division, it composed the 39th Reserve Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. Brought to the Eastern Front at the beginning of February, detraining\r\nat Insterburg, it was a part of the army operating in Eastern Prussia\r\nafter February 12.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of March it was engaged on the Sopotzkyn-Chtabin\r\nfront in the region of Simno; on March 9 it covered the retreat of the\r\n21st Corps and fell back to Seiny, Suwalki and Augustowo (Mar. 10 to\r\n31).\r\n\r\n3. During May and June the 77th Reserve Division took part in the\r\nCourland raid. On May 5 it was identified as being on the Rossieny-\r\nBeisagola front (to the South of Chavli).\r\n\r\n\r\nGRODNO.\r\n\r\n4. Taking part in the summer offensive, it advanced through the regions\r\nof Grodno, Olita (Aug 30) and Vileiki (Sept 27).\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of November it established itself in the vicinity of\r\nKchtchava, east of Novo-Alexandrovsk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. The 77th Reserve Division stayed in the region north of Kchtchava—and\r\nsouth of Dvinsk during all of 1916 and until August 1917. In August of\r\n1916 it gave one of its regiments—the 256th—to the Mitau group and later\r\nto the 218th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of August, 1917, the 77th Reserve Division was transferred\r\nfrom the region of the Dvinsk to the Riga front, being brought up to\r\nstrength by the addition of the 332d Regiment, the latter having\r\noriginally come from the 83d Division after having successively been\r\npart of the 11th Landwehr Division and the 8th Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n2. In October the 77th Reserve Division appeared in the vicinity of\r\nFriedrichstadt; near Jakobstadt, at the end of October. The 255th\r\nRegiment may have participated about this date in the occupation of the\r\nisland of Oesel.\r\n\r\n3. On November 5 the division is identified in the region of Libau; on\r\nJanuary 20, the 257th Regiment at Mitau; and to the northwest of the\r\nNovo-Alexandrovsk-Dvinsk railway, the 255th Regiment on February 10. On\r\nMarch 1 the 332d Regiment of Infantry was to leave “in order to advance\r\nin the East” (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nPrincipally Westphalia for the 255th Regiment; Rhenish provinces for the\r\n257th and 332d Regiments.

One of its\r\npresent regiments, the 332d, is a former regiment of the Posen garrison,\r\nof which two of the three battalions were Rhenish Landsturm battalions.\r\nSuccessive replacements gave this regiment the appearance of an ordinary\r\nregiment. In January, 1918, the older and sickly men were released.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division left Russia about April 1 and traveled via Magdebourg-\r\nHildesheim-Cologne-Gerolstein-Gouvy-Bastogne-Lebramont-Sedan-Liart-\r\nRozay-Montcornet, detraining in the vicinity of Laon on April 4. It\r\nmarched by stages toward Villers-Carbonnel-Athies, where it rested and\r\ntrained from April 11 to 19. On April 20 it entered the line north of\r\nHangard and was engaged until the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It returned to line east of Villers-Bretonneux on May 18 and held\r\nthat sector until July 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. The division was moved to the Woevre by Hirson and Montmedy and on\r\nJuly 14 relieved the 183d Division in the Flirey sector. It held that\r\nsector until the American attack on St. Mihiel on September 12. The\r\ndivision suffered very heavy losses in prisoners, but had few other\r\ncasualties, the prisoners stating that they were completely cut off by\r\nthe American barrage. It was withdrawn on September 16 and did not\r\nthereafter return to line.\r\n\r\n4. What remained of the 77th Reserve Division was reassembled at Pagny\r\nand was occupied in organizing the ground between Pagny and Prenay. A\r\nreport of October 11 stated that the division passed through Berlin on\r\nits way to the Balkan front on October 2. The division was then\r\nconsidered as withdrawn from the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was not seriously engaged\r\nexcept in the St. Mihiel attack, which practically destroyed the\r\ndivision. Its morale was only mediocre.

One of its regiments—the\r\n258th—grew out of three field battalions of the 8th Corps Region (Nos.\r\n40–42) and the 259th and the 260th out of six field battalions (Nos.\r\n49–54) of the 10th Corps District. All three regiments were trained at\r\nthe Alten-Grabow cantonment (4th Corps District).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In action on the Russian front to the north of Grodno, near Simno,\r\nKalvariia and Suwalki in March, 1915, it took part in the Courland raid\r\n(region of Chavli) in May. It was engaged in the operations on the\r\nDubissa to the northeast of Rossieny from the end of May to the middle\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n2. In July, with the Army of Niemen (Beulow) it took part in the\r\noffensive against Russia, occupied the region of Poneviej, to the west\r\nof Kupichki (August) arrived before Dvinsk in September and held a\r\nposition near the Illukst (September-December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. The 78th Reserve Division remained in the Illukst (region of Dvinsk)\r\nduring the whole year 1916 and until the month of April, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved from the Illukst region on April 14, 1917, the division was\r\ntransferred to the Western Front. It entrained on April 15 (itinerary:\r\nKovno-Wirballen-Allenstein-Posen-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Karlsruhe-Friberg-\r\nMuelheim) and detrained near Mulhausen on the 19th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE (ALSACE).\r\n\r\n2. On April 25 it went into line in the Burnhaupt sector to the north of\r\nthe Rhône-Rhine Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE-AILETTE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved on May 11, it was sent into the Aisne. For 10 weeks it\r\noccupied (May 23-Aug. 5) the sector south of the Ailette, where it did\r\nnot participate in any action of importance. Beginning with June 19 it\r\nmade a series of local attacks in which the 258th Regiment suffered some\r\nfairly big losses (especially on June 20, to the east of Vauxaillon).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. Sent toward the Verdun front as a reserve at the time of the French\r\noffensive of August 20, it was engaged to the north of Caurières\r\n(southwest of the Ornes) on September 10. On September 13 it executed a\r\ncounterattack and continued to occupy this difficult sector until the\r\nmiddle of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from Verdun, the division immediately went into line along\r\nthe banks of the Seille (between Cheminot and Abaucourt) on October 14.\r\nIts stay in Lorraine was devoid of any particular event.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n6. Toward the middle of December it was withdrawn from the Abaucourt\r\nsector and put at rest for instruction in the region of Chambley-Mars la\r\nTour (Dec. 18 to Jan. 11, 1918), then sent to Seicheprey toward the\r\nmiddle of January. It was identified as still there on March 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nOne of the three regiments, the 258th, was Rhenish; the 259th was an\r\n“Oldenberger” Regiment, while the 260th was a Hanoverian and\r\nBrunswickian organization, terms found in documents, as well as the\r\ndesignation Lower Saxony, a more general term.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring corps districts (7th, Westphalia, and 9th, Schleswig-\r\nHolstein) were occasionally called upon for replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 78th Reserve Division showed up well on the Eastern Front and on the\r\nFrench front.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard stay opposite Verdun, the division seems to have gone\r\nthrough a moral crisis; relatively high number of desertions took place\r\nin the 258th, and especially in the 259th Regiment. The intention of the\r\nHigh Command in sending the division into Lorraine (October-December,\r\n1917) is said to have been done with an idea of giving its chiefs an\r\nopportunity of getting their units well in hand again.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the vigorous command and the fairly high number of\r\neffectives, taken for the greater part from the younger classes, make\r\nthe 78th Reserve Division a combat division worthy of consideration. At\r\nJonville at the end of December, 1917, the division took part in assault\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that a certain number of recruits were from Alsace and\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATEAU THIERRY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Woevre about May 11 by the 8th\r\nBavarian Reserve Division. It came into line on June 4 west of Dammard\r\n(Ourcq region). It was engaged until about July 20 and then withdrawn.\r\n\r\n2. The division was disbanded at Montcornet on August 12. The 259th\r\nReserve Regiment was broken up and one battalion of it sent to each\r\nregiment of the 2d Guard Division. The 260th Reserve Regiment was turned\r\nas a draft to the 20th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. After about two weeks of heavy\r\nfighting on the Marne salient, the division was dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         79th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │79 Res.       │261 Res.      │79 Res.       │261 Res.\r\n              │              │262 Res.      │              │262 Res.\r\n              │              │263 Res.      │              │263 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │79 Res.

At the end of March,\r\nhaving come back in the northeast, it held the passes in the lakes to\r\nthe east of Suwalki-Augustowo.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of May the 40th Reserve Corps advanced toward\r\nKalwaria-Mariampol.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOVNO.\r\n\r\n5. On June 9 the 79th Reserve Division appeared before Kovno; it took\r\npart in the siege and the taking of this town (July-Aug. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n6. The offensive against the Russians took it through Ochmiana (?) to\r\nthe south of Smorgoni (Aug. 27). The division took a position in this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI-KREVO.\r\n\r\n7. The division occupied the Krevo-Smorgoni (south of Vilna) sector from\r\nthe end of August, 1915, until some time in November, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-FRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved from the Smorgoni sector at the end of November, 1916, the\r\n79th Division was transferred to the Western Front. It entrained at\r\nMitau (Itinerary: Chavli-Grodno-Bielostok-Varsovie-Lodz-Kalisz-Glogau-\r\nCottbus-Halle-Paderborn-Duesseldorf-Aix la Chapelle-Herbesthal-Liege-\r\nLouvain-Brussels) and detrained at Ascq (east of Lille) on December 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\n2. Remained there at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE.\r\n\r\n1. About January 10, 1917, it took over the La Bassee-Vermelles sector\r\n(up to Jan. 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS-VIMY.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of February it appeared in the Lens sector and on March 3\r\non the Vimy front. On April 9 it was sorely tried by the British attack\r\non the heights of Vimy, where it lost 1,660 prisoners.\r\n\r\n3. It was relieved about April 14 and put at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\n4. On May 3 the division entered the line again in the quiet sector to\r\nthe southwest of Lille (between Boutillerie and Fauquissart). It stayed\r\nthere until July 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. After a few days rest at Templeuve it was transferred to Flanders,\r\nwhere it was again at rest (east of Bruges) (July).\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGEMARCK.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of the British offensive at Ypres (July 31) it was\r\nbrought to Langemarck as a “counterattack” division. Engaged on August 6\r\nit suffered very heavy losses and abandoned Langemarck during the attack\r\nof the 16th. It was relieved on the 16th, having lost 75 per cent of its\r\nstrength. It was put at rest east of Cambrai and reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n7. On September 1 it took over the sector northwest of St. Quentin\r\n(Pontruet-Gricourt), which it occupied until November 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n8. On November 21, by reason of the British offensive, it hastily put\r\ntwo battalions in action at Masnières.\r\n\r\n9. At the beginning of December the 79th Reserve Division went into line\r\nto the east of Gouzeaucourt. It was relieved in January, 1918,\r\nreappeared on the front at the beginning of February near Gonnelieu, and\r\nwent back to rest at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 261st and 262d Regiments were taken from depots of the Guard and\r\nwere recruited like the latter, from all sections of Prussia. The 263d\r\nRegiment was a “Magdeberg” unit (Prussian Saxony).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 79th Division, already sorely tried at Vimy in April, was much used\r\nat Ypres in August, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe 261st and 262d Regiments were completely demoralized during the\r\nBritish attack and fled to the rear. According to an officer this panic\r\nwas due to the lack of combat spirit displayed by the 1918 class, which\r\nmade up an important part of the strength of the soldiers engaged.\r\n\r\nIt arrived in a very worn out condition in the St. Quentin sector and\r\nleft it on November 28 with nearly full strength and replacement of\r\nmaterial. It should (December, 1917) be capable of putting forth an\r\nappreciable effort.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers from Alsace and Lorraine, formerly numerous in this\r\ndivision, were withdrawn from this unit when it was sent to the French\r\nfront. Ninety-three of them remained in the 252d Regiment, who were\r\nmostly sent to the Eastern Front on July 3, 1917 (German order).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division reenforced the Somme battle front on March 21 near\r\nRonssoy. It advanced west of Epehy on March 22 and was withdrawn to\r\nsecond line a day later. It followed up the advance and took part in the\r\nattack near Meaulte on April 5, after which it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLEUL.\r\n\r\n2. It rested in Belgium for five weeks, and on May 26 entered the line\r\nnorthwest of Bailleul. It was relieved on the night of June 19–20.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in Roubaix area until July 20, when it was\r\ntransferred by rail to Tergnier (west of La Fere) and then marched to\r\nGuny, west of Coucy le Chateau, where it remained in army reserve. On\r\nAugust 8 the division was alarmed, and at mid-day was transferred in\r\nmotor busses via Chauny-Ham-Nesle to Rethonvillers, arriving before dawn\r\non the 9th. It came into action on the following day at 4 kilometers\r\nnortheast of Andechy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. At once the division was heavily engaged with all nine battalions in\r\nline. On the 13th its place was taken by the 121st Division, and it\r\nrested for three or four days in the area southwest of Nesle. On the\r\n16th the division relieved the 204th Division on the line east of\r\nGoyencourt-Hill 81, west of Roye-Avre. It was heavily engaged in\r\nopposing the French attacks until August 31, when it was withdrawn east\r\nof Roye.\r\n\r\n5. On September 5 the division relieved the Alpine Corps at Epenancourt.\r\nIt fell back in a northeasterly direction by Atilly, southeast of\r\nVermand, southeast of Maissemy, Pontruet, and Gricourt. It was relieved\r\nabout October 8 after losing 2,200 prisoners in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE.\r\n\r\n6. When relieved, the division went to the Fres-Sancourt area (north of\r\nSt. Gobain), where it was in reserve. About the 14th it was taken to La\r\nFerte-Chevresis to construct rear positions. It was moved in trucks on\r\nthe 18th by Sains-Richaumont-Wiege-Villers les Guise-Iron near Etreux.\r\nIt went into line on the evening of the 18th, relieving elements of the\r\n81st Division. It was engaged until the armistice. The line of retreat\r\nwas through Boue, Boulogne, Avesnes, Sobre le Chateau. In the last place\r\nit was identified on November 10.\r\n\r\nAt the end the effective strength of the division was greatly\r\ndiminished, although it had received drafts from the dissolved 201st and\r\n202d Regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Throughout 1918 the division was\r\nextensively used in important defensive sectors, in which it did fairly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         80th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │80 Res.       │264 Res.      │80 Res.       │264 Res.\r\n              │              │265 Res.      │              │266 Res.\r\n              │              │266 Res.      │              │34 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │80 Res.

Organized during the winter of 1914–15, this division and the 79th\r\nReserve Division formed the 40th Reserve Corps. The 80th Reserve\r\nDivision was formed out of three field battalions of the 4th Corps\r\nDistrict (Nos. 22–24) and six field battalions (Nos. 43–48) of the 9th\r\nCorps District. After training at the Lockstedt cantonment it was sent\r\nto Eastern Prussia at the beginning of February, 1915. There it took\r\npart in the battle of the Lakes of Masura from the 7th to the 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n2. From the end of February to the beginning of March it was actively\r\nengaged in the region of the fortress of Ossoviec and took part in\r\ncombats along the Polish frontier before the Russian retreat in Eastern\r\nPrussia. In March it was brought back to the frontier of Eastern Prussia\r\nand fought in the zone of the Suvalki government until July. It\r\nexchanged the 265th Regiment for the 34th Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n3. At the time of the Summer offensive the division participated in the\r\ntaking of Kovno (Aug. 18), fought on the Niémen (Aug. 19, Sept. 8th) and\r\nentered Vilna. It occupied the new front in the region of Smorgoni and\r\nheld this sector until March, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. In March, 1916, the division opposed the Russian offensive on the\r\nNarotch Lake front and occupied this sector until the month of December.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. On December 23 it entrained for the Western Front. (Itinerary:\r\nLyntuny (northeast of Vilna)-Vilna-Kovno-Koenigsberg-Danzig-Stettin-\r\nHamberg-Hanover-Cologne-Aix la Chapelle-Liège-Mons.) It detrained at\r\nDouai on the 29th and 30th of December and was put at rest at Waziers\r\n(northeast of Douai) until the middle of January, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. January 18, 1917, it went into line before Neuve Chapelle (north of\r\nthe canal of la Bassée).\r\n\r\n2. Relieved at about the beginning of March, it took over a sector to\r\nthe south of Lens (Mar. 14). Obliged to fall back to the Méricourt-Avion\r\nline after the capture of the heights of Vimy by the British troops\r\n(Apr. 9), it suffered serious losses in the course of that operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. On May 16 it was relieved from the Lens front and sent to rest in the\r\nregion of Trent until May 29.\r\n\r\n4. From May 29 to June 22 it held the Boesinghe-Wieltje sector, where it\r\ntook part in no engagements.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. After resting, in July, in the region of Sedan-Montmédy, the 80th\r\nReserve Division was brought (July 20) as a reserve to the left bank of\r\nthe Meuse, and at the beginning of August to the right bank (region of\r\nJuvigny-Jametz-Etraye).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n6. On August 14 it drew near the front and on August 20 reenforced, near\r\nHill 344, the units strained by the French attack. On the 23d it\r\nsustained very heavy losses and gave up the counter attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n7. At the beginning of September the division entrained for Champagne.\r\nIt occupied the Tahure sector the first half of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n8. At the beginning of October it took over the Boureuilles-Vauquois\r\nsector, which it left on January 23, 1918, going to the Semide\r\ncantonment for training.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 264th Regiment was recruited in the 4th Corps District and is\r\nsometimes called an Altenberg regiment. The 266th Regiment is a\r\nMecklenberg unit. The 34th Regiment is Pomeranian in theory with a\r\nfairly heterogeneous make-up like the greater number of the units from\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 80th Reserve Division, which seems to have had a high morale while\r\nopposite the English front, did not come up to expectations on August\r\n20, 1917, while opposite Verdun. It proved incapable of counter\r\nattacking. It is reported that there were desertions and mutiny among\r\nthe men which resulted in the relieving of the general commanding the\r\nbrigade and of the commanding officer of the 264th Regiment.\r\n\r\nThe 34th Regiment was completely exhausted during the attacks of August\r\n20.\r\n\r\nIn Argonne the losses of this division were very slight. At the Semide\r\ncantonment (Jan. 23 to Feb. 20, 1918) the division went through various\r\nmaneuvers connected with open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the Vauquois sector by the 237th\r\nDivision from Russia about March 18. It rested and trained until March\r\n27, when it traveled by St. Quentin-Ham-Roye to the vicinity of Moreuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It reenforced the battle front north of Sauvillers on April 3, but\r\nwas withdrawn on the 7th and rested at Ribemont. Losses were heavy\r\nduring the brief engagement of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division relieved the 14th Bavarian Division on April 21–22 in\r\nthe sector Cornillet-Mont Blond. It remained there until the July 15\r\noffensive, but did not take part in that action. On July 27 it returned\r\nto line near Moronvilliers and held that sector until August 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nAILETTE-AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. It marched to Paris and went into line there. Two days later it was\r\nhastily relieved and marched to Chavignon. It entered line on the night\r\nof September 2–3 northwest of Crouy. It was withdrawn on September 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division returned to Champagne and relieved the 213th Division on\r\nSeptember 27 at Loivre. It was engaged near Orainville, Aumenancourt,\r\nPont Givart until October 11. It was again in line on October 17 at\r\nNanteuil sur Aisne. It continued in line until the end of hostilities.\r\nThe last identification was near Wasigny on November 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. In general, it was used to hold\r\nless important defensive sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         81st Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │81 Res.       │267 Res.      │81 Res.       │267 Res.\r\n              │              │268 Res.      │              │268 Res.\r\n              │              │269 Res.      │              │269 Res.\r\n              │              │              │              │39 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │81 Res.

The first six were used to form the 267th and the\r\n268th and the last named three were used to form the 269th Regiment. The\r\ndivision was instructed at the Warthe cantonment (5th Corps District)\r\nbefore being sent to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n1. The 81st Reserve Division (with the 82d Reserve Division it\r\nconstituted the 41st Reserve Corps), was transported to Belgium and\r\ndetrained at Courtrai January 21, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to the Somme district, it was engaged to the north of Chaulnes\r\n(Jan. 27-Mar. 28).\r\n\r\n3. At the end of March the division was sent toward the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA-RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nThe division was found on the Galician front in May (Jaslo, May 9); took\r\npart in operations on the San, near Jaroslav (between San and the\r\nJaroslav-Przeworsk railway on May 15) then on the Bug (region of Krylov\r\nin July). Going down the Bug by Vladova (August) it advanced up to the\r\nwest of Logitchin and the Oginsky Canal (north of Pinsk) in September.\r\nThe front becoming fixed, the division established itself in that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINSK.\r\n\r\n1. The 81st Reserve Division stayed for more than two years in the\r\nOginski-Iasälda Canal sector (Sept., 1915-Dec., 1917).\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July, 1916, the 269th Regiment was identified\r\nbetween the Styr and the Stokhod, doubtlessly as a reserve for the units\r\nengaged against the Russian offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-FRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. In December, 1917, the division was relieved from its sector to the\r\nnorth of Pinsk and transported to the Western Front. It entrained on\r\nDecember 20 at Ivanovo (Itinerary: Soldau-Bromberg-Schneide-Muehl-\r\nBerlin-Sarrebruck-Sedan-Cambrai), and detrained at Lille on December 26.\r\nAfter resting in the vicinity of Lille it went into line to the south of\r\nFleurbaix (Jan. 24–25, 1918). It again occupied the same sector at the\r\nbeginning of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 267th and the 268th Regiments were originally Pomeranian and became\r\nquite heterogeneous like all regiments from this province. The 268th\r\nRegiment was in theory recruited in Silesia which contributes to a\r\nmaintenance of the mixed character of its personnel. The 269th is a\r\nBrandenburg unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nOn the Eastern Front from May, 1915, to the end of December, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on the night of April 8–9 by the 35th\r\nDivision at Neuve Chapelle. It moved northward and on the 12th\r\nreenforced the battle front south of Meteren. In the attacks in this\r\narea the 268th and 269th Reserve Regiments suffered heavy losses. It was\r\nrelieved by the 11th Reserve Division on April 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEREN.\r\n\r\n2. On May 18 the division returned to its former sector at Meteren. It\r\nheld this sector until May 28, and again from June 6 to 12 and from June\r\n18 to July 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. It entrained on the 22d at Roubaix and detrained at Haboudange on the\r\n24th. The itinerary was Courtrai-Ghent-Louvain-Liege-Herbestal-\r\nGerolstein-Treves-Sarreguemines. After several days of rest near Chateau\r\nSalins it relieved the 19th Division on the night of July 28–29. It held\r\nthis quiet sector until October 5, when it was relieved by the 87th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n4. It entrained on the 6th and detrained at Guise about October 8. On\r\nthe night of the 10th–11th it came into line near Seboncourt and was\r\nheavily engaged until October 20, when it was withdrawn east of Bohain.\r\nThe division suffered heavy losses in this engagement.\r\n\r\n5. On October 26 the division reenforced the line south of Guise and\r\nfought until the armistice. The last identification was south of Guise\r\non November 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.

Formed during November, 1914-January, 1915, with three field\r\nbattalions of the 3d Corps District and six of the 6th Corps District\r\n(Nos. 25–30) it was trained at the Jueterbog cantonment. The 82d Reserve\r\nDivision (which with the 81st Reserve Division formed the 41st Reserve\r\nCorps) entrained on January 21 for the Somme. It included an additional\r\nregiment—the 60th Infantry—which the 21st Corps had left in France\r\nbefore leaving for Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged in February and March, 1915, to the north of Chaulnes.\r\n\r\n3. About March 28 it was transferred to the Eastern Front minus the 60th\r\nInfantry, which joined the 121st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA-RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. In May, 1915, the 82d Reserve Division as well as the 81st Reserve\r\nDivision took part in the German offensive along the San, which resulted\r\nin the breaking up of the Russian front in Galicia. It was identified in\r\nregion of Jaslo (May 9) to the south of Radymno (May 12–21) and at\r\nMedyka (June 4). Its pursuit of the Russians brought it together with\r\nthe 41st Reserve Corps to the Bug, in the vicinity of Grubeszow (July)\r\nand to the northeast of Pinsk (September-October). During that offensive\r\nthe division suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINSK.\r\n\r\n5. The Russian retreat being halted, the 82d Reserve Division took its\r\nposition in the Pinsk region (Nobel Lake, October-December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINSK-NOBEL LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained the entire year in the Nobel Lake sector and up\r\nto November, 1917. A soldier of the 270th Regiment wrote on November 8,\r\n1917: “I have not loaded my gun since the middle of March.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-FRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. In November, 1917, the 82d Reserve Division was relieved by some\r\nLandsturm units and re-formed (elimination of soldiers from Alsace and\r\nLorraine, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of December the division was transported to the\r\nWestern Front.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained at Ivanovo on December 4 (Itinerary: Brest-\r\nLitowsk-Varsovie-Kalisz-Glogau-Cottbus-Halle-Frankfort-Mainz-Kreuznach-\r\nSarrebrueck-Metz-Conflans) and detrained at Mars la Tour about December\r\n10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nIn theory Brandenburg and Silesia. Very mixed personnel, seemingly\r\nincluding men from Pomerania and the eastern Provinces of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, the 82d Reserve Division took part in maneuvers in the\r\nvicinity of Thuméréville (northwest of Conflans). After these maneuvers\r\nLieut. Gen. Fuchs is said to have said that the division could be put in\r\nclass 3 of the combat units (Kampf Truppen, 3) a classification which is\r\njust above that of labor troops. (Interrogation of prisoner, Mar. 4,\r\n1918. See Bull. Rens. Second Army (French), No. 744.)\r\n\r\nThe make-up of the division is heterogeneous and of mediocre quality and\r\nincludes returned wounded men, Landsturm, former railway guards,\r\ndismounted troopers, and few recruits of the 1918 class. (Interrogation,\r\nJan. 22, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAfter a two-year stay in the Pinsk sector the 82d Reserve Division\r\nlacked training when it returned on the Western Front (December, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTIGNY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on April 20 in the Woevre and marched by\r\nConflans-Briey-Mairy to Landres, where it entrained. It moved via\r\nLonguyon-Mezieres-Hirson and arrived at Wassigny, where it detrained on\r\nMay 5. On May 16 the division relieved the 30th Division west of\r\nCantigny. It was thrown out of the city by the American attack at the\r\nend of the month. The division was withdrawn about July 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. To reenforce the Somme battle front the division came into line on\r\nAugust 9 between Hangest and Arvillers. It was withdrawn on the 18th\r\nnorthwest of Roye, but a week later returned to its former sector. The\r\ndivision fell back on the Canal du Nord on August 27, and on September 2\r\ntook up a position between the Chaulnes-Ham railroad and a point north\r\nof Moyencourt. It again retreated on the night of September 4–5 and\r\noccupied a position at Etreillers-Roupy before the Siegfried-Stellung.\r\n\r\nThe division was constantly engaged, resisting strongly, but being\r\ngradually forced back. On the 28th it retired to the line of the St.\r\nQuentin Canal. On October 8, a surprise attack threw it back to Fontaine\r\nNotre Dame. Here it resisted fiercely. It was relieved about October 10\r\nand went to the Guise area.\r\n\r\nIn this fighting the division lost 2,000 men. Its combatant strength was\r\nestimated to be about 1,200 men on October 7.\r\n\r\n3. On October 14 the division reenforced the line east of Bernot and\r\nfought for three days. It returned to the Guise area, but intervened\r\nagain west of Pleine-Selve on October 25. Until the armistice it was\r\nengaged south of Guise, east of La Capelle, and at Liessies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. After August it was almost\r\nconstantly in line in the St. Quentin area until its effectives were\r\nalmost completely consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             83d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │Doussin (1    │1 Garrison    │165.          │329.\r\n              │  Garrison    │  Rgt.

It was engaged on the Eastern\r\nFront from the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nThe Posen Corps composed of depot battalions of active regiments, of\r\nreserve, of Landwehr, and even battalions of Landsturm, was divided into\r\nfour brigades. Its strength was distributed into two divisions, the 83d\r\nand 84th, in June, 1915, and the battalions, which were at first formed\r\ninto regiments bearing the names of the respective commanders of these\r\nregiments, were numbered 329 to 336, inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n1. From March to June, with the Posen Corps, the regiments which were to\r\nform the 83d Reserve Division took part in the Poland campaign to the\r\nnorth of Pilica and on the Bzura.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICHNEV.\r\n\r\n2. The 83d Division took part in the summer offensive against the\r\nRussians. Leaving the Ostrolenka region (July) it advanced by way of\r\nGrodno, Lipnichki (northeast of Lida, September) up to Vichnev\r\n(October), where it established its position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICHNEV.\r\n\r\n1. The division stayed in the Vichnev sector during the entire year 1916\r\nand until the month of April, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. About the middle of April, 1917, the 83d Division was transferred\r\nfrom Vichnev to Baranovitchi, where it was held some time as a reserve\r\nand then to the northeast of Halicz, from which place it was transported\r\nby automobiles to the Stanislau region (June 5).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July it was attacked by the Russians to the west\r\nof Stanislau (serious losses on July 9, particularly 690 prisoners). It\r\nafterwards took part in the German counteroffensive and advanced through\r\nthe Dniester valley up to the west of Chotin (beginning of August.)\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about the middle of September, the 83d Reserve Division was\r\nsent to rest in the Czernovitz region and then put back in line to the\r\nnortheast of Bojan (October-November).\r\n\r\n4. At the end of November the division left the Bojan sector and became\r\na reserve for the Bothmer Army in back of the Czernovitz front. Before\r\nleaving for the Western Front the 4th Division had sent it men from\r\nAlsace and Lorraine (middle of December when the 36th Division had left\r\nthe former some months before.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nRecruiting was mostly from Posen and Silesia with some support from\r\nWestphalia and the Rhine Province. Coming from Galicia as late as March,\r\n1918, the 83d Division could not come without the soldiers coming from\r\nAlsace and Lorraine which other divisions which had left before had\r\ntransferred to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nMediocre division, formed to the extent of one third by older men.\r\nAppears for the first time on the Western Front in April, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector north of Ypres until July 18. After its\r\nrelief it rested a few days in Roulers and then entrained at\r\nLichterfelde for the Douai area. On August 16 it traveled via Cambrai\r\nand detrained near Ruyanlcourt. Here it spent the night, moving up to\r\nFlers the next morning. The division came into line on the 19th, when it\r\nrelieved the 3d Naval Division north of Albert.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged at Thiepval, Bazentin le Grand, Courcelette, and\r\nMartinpuich until about April 26, when it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n3. On September 10, the division came into line in Lorraine with an\r\nentirely new composition. It then included the 255th Reserve Regiment,\r\nthe 346th Regiment, and the 4th Landwehr Regiment grouped under the\r\nbrigade and divisional staff of the 83d Division. The 329th Regiment,\r\none of the former regiments of the division, was sent to Esthonia on\r\nSeptember 5. It had lost 700 casualties in the August fighting. The\r\nreconstructed division held the Embermenil sector until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class. After its transfer to the\r\nWestern Front, the division held a quiet sector except for a short time\r\non the Scarpe in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             84th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │Hoffmann,     │5 Garrison    │168.          │334.\r\n              │  afterward   │  Rgt.

(See 83d\r\nDivision.) It was organized in June, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. After having fought in Poland to the north of Pilica (February to\r\nJune, 1915) the elements of the 84th Division operated in the region of\r\nBleudow.\r\n\r\n2. The 84th Division took part in the offensive against the Russians. It\r\nadvanced through the region of Bug (Aug. 17), through the southeast of\r\nBielsk (end of August) north of Slonim (September, battle from the 13th\r\nto the 18th), up to the south of Novogrodek (Sept. 22). The front having\r\nbecome stationary, the division took a position in the vicinity of\r\nDeliatitchi (north of the Niemen). In December it gave up the 333d\r\nRegiment of Infantry to the 89th Division, then recently organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 84th Division stayed in the sector in the vicinity of the Niemen\r\n(Liubtcha, Deliatitchi) during the entire year 1916.\r\n\r\n2. From July to October the 334th and 335th Regiments were detached as\r\nreenforcements between Goroditche and Baranovitchi to meet the Russian\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In 1917 the division still occupied the same sectors along the Niemen\r\n(Deliatitchi, Negnevitchi) until its departure for the Western Front\r\n(December).\r\n\r\n2. About the month of June the 334th Infantry was transferred to the\r\n94th Division and replaced by the 423d Infantry, to which the former\r\ntransferred some of its men.\r\n\r\nIn December the division absorbed another lot of men from the 334th\r\nInfantry and some from the Landsturm Battalion V. 15. Its strength had\r\nsince November included some young men of the class of 1919.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of December the division was transported to France. The 3d\r\nBattalion of the 423d Regiment entrained at Novogrodek on December 31.\r\n(Itinerary: Varsovie-Leipzig-Frankfort on the Main-Thionville) and\r\ndetrained at Arrancy (south of Longuyon) on January 7. The 2d Battalion\r\nof the 336th Regiment entrained on December 28 and detrained at Landres\r\non January 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was for the most part recruited from the 5th and the 7th\r\nCorps Districts. This was but slightly changed by the incorporation of\r\nthe men of the Landsturm Battalion V. 15 which consisted mostly of\r\nsoldiers from Brandenburg and of the addition of those belonging to the\r\nclass of 1919 which came from the 4th Corps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 84th Division had been on the Eastern front since 1914. Its\r\noffensive value was mediocre.\r\n\r\nOn the Russian front it began to fraternize at the end of December. The\r\nGermans were only allowed to do so in the presence of their officers. In\r\nNovember and about December 20 the men in the division who were over 40\r\nyears of age were transferred into Landsturm battalions or into\r\nregiments staying in Russia, and replaced by young men nearly all\r\nbelonging to the class of 1919 (250 to the 84th Division in November).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER-NOYON.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved by the 53d Reserve Division about May 1. It\r\nmoved west and on May 25 relieved the 3d Bavarian Division in the\r\nLassigny sector. It was taken out in early June and rested until the\r\n9th, when it returned to attack at Courcelles. It again retired on June\r\n20 and rested until July 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n2. On that date it was in line southeast of Belloy, where it was engaged\r\nuntil mid-July. It rested near Antheuil until August 12, when it\r\nreenforced the battle front south of Thiescourt. Then it was engaged\r\nuntil about August 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n3. One regiment—the 423d—entered line on the Oise on August 22 and by\r\nSeptember 4 all the division was in line near Quierzy. It was withdrawn\r\non September 15.\r\n\r\n4. On September 30 the division entered line at Trouquoy and south of\r\nSequehart. In the fighting in the first week of October the elements of\r\nthe division were badly mixed with other divisions. They were taken out\r\nabout October 9 and re-formed.\r\n\r\n5. It was reengaged on October 27 in the vicinity of Sissonne and fought\r\nuntil the armistice. The last identification was east of Bucy les\r\nPierrepont on November 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class. It was a very mediocre unit,\r\ncomposed largely of Landsturm elements and of young recruits. It was\r\ndecimated by the fighting in the fall and its morale became very bad. A\r\ncontributing factor was a draft of 300 prisoners returned from Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        85th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │69 Ldw.       │17 Ldw.       │169 Ldw.      │61 Ldw.\r\n              │              │21 Ldw.       │              │99 Ldw.\r\n              │              │61 Ldw.       │170 Ldw.      │17 Ldw.\r\n              │              │99 Ldw.       │              │21 Ldw.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │85 Cav.

Two of the regiments, the 17th Landwehr and the 99th Landwehr, went\r\nto the Eastern Front, the former at the beginning of the war and the\r\nlatter in the spring of 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND.\r\n\r\n1. Until July, 1915, the Breugel Division was engaged in Poland\r\n(Prasnysz, region of Mlawa).\r\n\r\n2. In July it took part in the offensive against the Russians, advancing\r\nto the west of Pultusk (middle of July); besieged Novo-Georgievsk; was\r\non the Bug (beginning of August) and near Bielsk (end of August). The\r\n61st Landwehr entered Warsaw on August 22 and remained there during the\r\nmonth of September.\r\n\r\n3. With the stabilization of the front the former Breugel, now the 85th\r\nLandwehr Division occupied the Vichnev sector (to the south of Krevo) on\r\nthe Little Berezina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICHNEV.\r\n\r\n1. The 85th Landwehr Division remained on the Vichnev-Deliatitchi front\r\nfor more than two years (September, 1915—October, 1917). In September,\r\n1917, it gave up the 61st Landwehr Regiment to the 217th Division, then\r\nnewly organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICHNEV.\r\n\r\n1. About the 15th of October, 1917, the 85th Landwehr Division moved to\r\nthe north. It left the Niemen region to go to the south of Dvinsk, near\r\nthe lake of Drisviaty. In December it extended its sector toward the\r\nsouth (Vidzy).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Landwehr was recruited in the 17th Corps District, or more\r\ngenerally in western Prussia. There were numerous soldiers from Alsace\r\nand Lorraine in the division. Frequent desertions on the part of the men\r\nfrom Lorraine and men from the mining region of the Sarre in 1914 on the\r\nFrench front led to the decision which sent the 17th Landwehr to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nRemained a long while in quiet sectors on the Russian front. The 85th\r\nLandwehr Division had but a very mediocre combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. Toward the end of January the men of the 85th Landwehr Division were\r\nstill fraternizing in the Vidzy region. The 17th Landwehr Regiment was\r\nin the vicinity of Jakobstadt in April and the 99th Landwehr Regiment\r\nparticipated at this time in the operations in Finland.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. Early in May the whole division, with the exception of some elements\r\n(14th Jaeger Battalion, 1st Guard Uhlan Regiment, 229th Mounted Machine\r\nGun Co.), moved to the Polotsk region. Regiments of the division were\r\nidentified in this area early in September. There was a rumor that the\r\ndivision had been transferred to the Western Front early in October, but\r\nthis seems unlikely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             86th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │Grossman      │Reinhard      │171.          │341.\r\n              │  (171).      │  (341).      │              │\r\n              │              │Krause (342). │              │342.\r\n              │Windhetm      │Hoebel (343). │172.          │343.\r\n              │  (172).      │              │              │\r\n              │              │Gropp (344).  │              │344.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │86 Cav.

On the evening of the 26th it left and marched toward the front; the\r\n27th it was in reserve; on the 28th it attacked near Trigny (west of\r\nRheims) and succeeded in advancing about 5 kilometers. On the 6th of\r\nJune the 86th and 232d Divisions, supported by the 33d Reserve Division,\r\ncaptured the town of Bligny (southwest of Rheims), but lost it the same\r\nafternoon when the French counterattacked. The 86th Division had quite\r\nheavy losses. It was relieved on July 21 by the 50th Division and went\r\nto rest in the region northwest of Rheims.\r\n\r\n4. On the 10th of August the division reenforced the front near Muizon\r\n(west of Rheims). It was relieved by the 10th Reserve Division on the\r\n28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAON.\r\n\r\n5. During the night of September 18–19 it relieved the 50th Reserve\r\nDivision near the Colombe farm (south of Laon). It was relieved about\r\nthe 23d of October.\r\n\r\n6. The division came back into line on November 5 in the vicinity of\r\nMarle; on the 7th it was identified northeast of Vervins; and on the 9th\r\nat Hirson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 86th was rated as a fourth-class division. It did not participate in\r\nany of the great offensives during 1918, but it did attack vigorously on\r\ntwo occasions and on the whole acquitted itself better than other\r\ndivisions similarly rated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             87th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │Griepenkeri.  │Leimbach      │173.          │345.\r\n              │              │  (345).      │              │\r\n              │              │Runge (346).  │              │346.\r\n              │Normann.      │Schwarz (347).│179.          │347.\r\n              │              │8 Landst.     │              │8 Landst.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │87 Cav.

Its battalions were made into a division at the beginning of June,\r\n1915. Before that time the Ersatz battalions, from which it was formed,\r\nbelonged to the Griepenkerl and Plantier detachments (Thorn Corps), and\r\nfought near the Polish frontier between the Vistula and Prasnysz. These\r\nwere the Leimbach-Zerener regiments which became the 345th, the Runge\r\nwhich became the 346th and the Schwarz which became the 347th, and to\r\nwhich latter unit the 8th Landsturm Regiment organized in June, 1915, at\r\nthe Elsenborn cantonment was joined.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning in July the elements of the 87th Division took part in the\r\noffensive against the Russians: Battles between Drobin and the Vistula,\r\nthen to the west of Pultusk; pursuit fighting up to lower Narew (July\r\n18–22); siege of Novo-Georgievsk (Aug. 13–19); battles of Niemen (Aug.\r\n31-Sept. 8) and of Vilna (Sept. 9–26).\r\n\r\n3. After having fought between the Bogin and Drisviaty Lakes (Oct.\r\n5–19), the division took up a position in that region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRISVIATY LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. The 87th Division occupied the Drisviaty-Vidzy line the entire year\r\n1916 and until the month of October, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In October, 1917, the 87th Division relieved the 2d Division in the\r\nIllukst sector. While there it received its first reenforcements from\r\nthe 1919 class.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved from that front at the end of December, the division was\r\nbrought together in the Kovno region. It got a great many men from the\r\n23d Landwehr Division, especially from the 26th and 66th Landwehr\r\nRegiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThis division was one of the most heterogeneous of the Prussian Army.\r\nNot only were its regiments recruited in three different Provinces, but\r\nthe considerable amount of replacements received since November, 1917,\r\nwere from various different regions—men from the class of 1919 from the\r\n9th and 11th Corps Districts in November, 1917, later from the 14th\r\nCorps District; Landwehr from the 4th and 6th Corps Districts at the end\r\nof December; men from the 8th, 14th, and 18th Corps Districts (a small\r\nnumber) during its stay in Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 87th Division coming from Russia at the end of March seemed to have\r\nbut a mediocre combat value (April, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the quiet sector at St. Marie a Py until June 18,\r\nwhen it was relieved by the extension of the flanking divisions. The\r\ndivision up to that time had had slight losses and was available for\r\nactive service.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. It entered line on June 22 on the Aisne front near Bouresches. During\r\nthis period the division was engaged in harder fighting. In the American\r\nattack south of Torcy the division lost heavily in killed and wounded on\r\nJune 25–26. Three hundred prisoners were taken on those days. It took\r\npart in the German retreat until July 26, when it was withdrawn near\r\nCharmel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARPE-SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested at Charleville until August 25. It entrained and\r\nmoved to the Bapaume-Peronne area, where it was engaged on August 26–27,\r\nsouth of Longueval. It was pushed back by Flers (29th), les Boeufs (Aug.\r\n31), north of Morval (Sept. 1), Le Transloy (3d), east of Manancourt and\r\nnortheast of Etricourt (4th), northeast of Fins (7th), northwest of\r\nGonzencourt (9th). It was relieved on the night of September 11–12.\r\nDuring this period in line the losses of the division were severe. More\r\nthan 1,000 prisoners were taken from this division.\r\n\r\n4. In spite of heavy losses it was given only a short rest at Vaucelles\r\n(south of Cambrai), and again placed in line east of Villers Guislain on\r\nSeptember 18 for the purpose of delivering a counterattack. It was held\r\nin line at this point until about September 28, when it retired to rest\r\nat Walincourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. On October 12 the division came into line southwest of Chateau\r\nSaline. It rested on that quiet front until about November 1, when it\r\nwas sent north, and on November 8 came in line at Haut Bugny. The last\r\nidentification was northeast of Rocquigny on November 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class. As a sector holding unit it saw\r\nheavy service on the Marne and in Picardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             88th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │21 Ldw.       │10 Ldw.       │175 Ldw.      │(349) Ldw.\r\n              │              │38 Ldw.       │              │(350) Ldw.\r\n              │1 Ldw.

The 88th Division grew out of the war garrison of Breslau, which was\r\nmade up of the 21st Brigade of Landwehr (10th and 38th Landwehr) and by\r\nSilesian and Saxon Ersatz battalions. This originally was the Breslau\r\nCorps, which after the brigade of Landwehr was taken from it, became the\r\nMenges Division. The Ersatz battalions being formed into regiments, the\r\ndivision then comprised three brigades—1st Landwehr Ersatz Brigade\r\n(later the Schmiedecker Brigade), Paczensky (later Buddenbrock) Brigade,\r\nand the Zenger Brigade. Its regiments bore the names 4th and 5th\r\nLandwehr Ersatz and 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Ersatz.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n2. In April-May, 1915, the Menges Division fought on the Pilica.\r\n\r\n3. In July it was between the Vistula and Pilica taking part in the\r\noffensive against Russia.\r\n\r\n4. It advanced in August through the region of Narew (to the south of\r\nPultusk, Aug. 4; to the north of Bielsk, Aug. 19). At the end of August\r\nit reached the region of Vilna; to the west of Dvinsk in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRISVIATY LAKE.\r\n\r\n5. When the front became stationary it took a position near the\r\nDrisviaty Lake (September).\r\n\r\n6. The Menges Division became the 88th Division. The Ersatz Battalion\r\nBrigades were regrouped and distributed between six regiments, numbered\r\n349th and 350th Landwehr, 351st, 352d, 353d, 354th Regiments of\r\nInfantry, forming in turn the 175th, 176th, and 177th Brigades.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRISVIATY LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. The 88th Division occupied the Drisviaty Lake sector from September,\r\n1915, until September, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. In July, 1916, the division was reconstituted. The 354th Regiment\r\nwent to the 216th Division. In August the 349th Landwehr and the 350th\r\nLandwehr Regiments were engaged on the Stokhod with the 150th Regiment\r\nof the 37th Division.\r\n\r\nThe 88th Division was now made up of the 351st, 352d, and 353d\r\nRegiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRISVIATY LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. In May, 1917, the 123d Division gave the 88th Division the 425th\r\nRegiment in exchange for the 351st Regiment of Infantry (Saxon). At this\r\ntime all the Saxon elements were out of this division and it became\r\nentirely made up of Prussian personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Thus constituted (352d, 353d, and 425th) the 88th Division was\r\nrelieved from its position near Drisviaty Lake about September. It\r\nremained in the Dvinsk region.\r\n\r\n3 The 425th Regiment was replaced by the 426th Regiment, the latter\r\ncoming from the 3d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe oldest regiments of the division, the 352d and the 353d, were\r\nprimarily recruited in Silesia, and the 426th in the 9th Corps District.\r\n\r\nMembers of the 1919 class were identified with the division in April,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n1. Early in January the division left Russia and, traveling via Kovno-\r\nWirballen-Koenigsberg-Posen-Berlin-Trèves-Thionville, detrained at\r\nSedan. After resting and training in the Cambrai region, it entered line\r\nin the Fresnoy sector (northwest of St. Quentin). It remained in line\r\nhere, although it had two 10-day rest periods during which it was\r\noccupied only in field service training and in the usual practice\r\nmarches, excepting two manœuvres with artillery. It attacked on the\r\n21st, and although held up a day in front of Holnon wood it did very\r\nwell, especially when it is considered that the division was considered\r\nunfit for combat upon its arrival from Russia.\r\n\r\n2. Just before reaching Vermand on the 24th it stopped advancing, and\r\nthe line continuing to go forward it remained in reserve. On the 27th it\r\nproceeded to the Moreuil area (southeast of Amiens), where it arrived\r\nwhen the German advance was already checked. It was withdrawn about the\r\n2d of April, after having suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. About the 12th of April it relieved the 11th Division south of\r\nRouvroy in eastern Champagne. It was relieved about the 25th of June by\r\nthe 33d Reserve Division and went to rest near Monthois, where it was\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n4. About the 13th of July it came back into line in the Tahure sector\r\njust west of where it had previously been. The next day it attacked in\r\nthe first line; it could make no progress (it will be remembered that\r\nthus the whole offensive was a failure) and suffered heavy losses,\r\nespecially on account of gas. It was relieved early in September and was\r\nreported at rest south of Rethel on the 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 12 the division moved up behind the front near\r\nDampvitoux (north of Thiaucourt), but since it was soon seen that the\r\nAmerican offensive had only a limited objective it did not enter line\r\nuntil the 23d. It was relieved by the 224th Division during the night of\r\nOctober 16–17.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division arrived at Stenay during the night of the 19th–20th of\r\nOctober and on the 21st entered line near Cunel (north of Montfaucon).\r\nIt remained in line until the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn March the British wrote: “From the bearing of prisoners of the 88th\r\nDivision, recently captured, it appears that this formation, which from\r\nits composition might be expected to be indifferent is of a very fair\r\nquality and well-disciplined. Men and officers are mostly young and\r\nkeen; many of the latter are active.\r\n\r\n“As a fighting formation, the 88th Division thus appears to have been\r\nbrought up to the standard of the majority of the German divisions in\r\nthe western theater and in addition has a leader well acquainted with\r\nthe conditions of warfare on this front.”\r\n\r\nAlthough its subsequent conduct was not such as to justify completely\r\nthe above estimate, it did at least prove that its rating as a fourth-\r\nclass unit was too low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             89th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │21 Ldw.       │10 Ldw.       │178.          │333.\r\n              │              │38 Ldw.       │              │375.\r\n              │(In November the above passed│              │8 Ldw.\r\n              │     to the 14 Ldw Div.)     │              │\r\n              │Jonas (178).  │333.          │              │\r\n              │              │375.          │              │\r\n              │              │8 Ldw.        │              │\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │89 Cav.

With the 87th Division, it was used to form, while named\r\nWesternhagen Division, the Thorn Corps, and was engaged on the Eastern\r\nFront from the beginning of the war. It at first was comprised of the\r\n21st Landwehr Brigade, taken from the Breslau Corps and the Jonas\r\nBrigade (Keller Regiment and the 8th Landwehr) which became the 178th\r\nBrigade. In November, 1915, this division having given up the 21st\r\nLandwehr Brigade to form the 14th Landwehr Division, it brought up its\r\nstrength to three regiments by taking the 333d Regiment from the 84th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1.

About the 24th of August, 1916, the 89th Division was transported to\r\nthe Transylvanian front (detraining near Maros-Ludas on Aug. 30).\r\n\r\n2. It fought in the vicinity of St. Georges de Brasso (middle of\r\nOctober); near the Roumanian frontier in the valley of Buzeu (October-\r\nNovember); on the Buzeu-Rimnicu-Sarat highway (end of December); and\r\nnear Plaginesci (Dec. 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In the middle of January, 1917, the 89th Division was in line to the\r\nnorth of Rimnicu.\r\n\r\n2. From the end of January to the middle of August it occupied a sector\r\nnorth of Focsani, east of Odobesci. It took part in the attacks made, in\r\nAugust, north of Focsani and suffered very heavy losses. After a few\r\ndays’ rest it took over the sector between Panciu and Marasesci.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 89th Division took part in the entire campaign against Roumania.\r\n\r\nIt was kept on the Roumanian front until May, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIts offensive value seemed mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1918, the division furnished a great many replacements to\r\nthe 76th Reserve Division which was destined to leave for the Western\r\nFront; men were also sent to the 115th Division.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved southeast of Panciu early in January, the division remained\r\nfor some time in reserve in the Focsani region, then came back into line\r\nnortheast of that town. It was identified there in March and April. In\r\nJune the 375th Regiment was identified by contact near Drenoud in\r\nMacedonia, but left soon after for the Panciu region where it was\r\nidentified on the 28th of July.

Later the\r\norganization of the 91st Division was modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. As soon as it was organized the 91st Division was engaged on the\r\nStokhod, north of the Kovel-Sarny railway and in the vicinity of Borovno\r\n(August, 1916). During these attacks the 150th suffered very big losses.\r\nThis regiment rejoined its division (the 37th) shortly thereafter and\r\nwas replaced by the 37th Landwehr, which had exercised a discreet\r\nsurveillance over the Austrian troops (Russian information).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. During the year 1917 the 91st Division was kept in Volhynia in the\r\nregion of the Kovel-Sarny railway.\r\n\r\n2. About the month of April it transferred the 350th Landwehr to the\r\n45th Landwehr Division. It received the 437th Infantry, which had been\r\norganized in 1916 from Prussian elements taken from the 344th Infantry,\r\nthe 349th Landwehr, and the 350th Landwehr, and which was with Austrian\r\nunits.\r\n\r\nIn November the division seemed to have no particular sector and is\r\n“distributed among the little reliable troops of the Austrian Army,”\r\n(Weekly Bulletin of Information of Russian Army, Dec. 16–23, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nKept in Russia for the occupation of Ukrainia, the 91st Division had but\r\na very small combat value (April, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

After the Russian offensive beginning in July the 96th Division was\r\nput into line in the Zborow sector. At the end of July it took part in\r\nthe German counteroffensive and advanced up to the Russian-Galician\r\nfrontier.

Later the 101st\r\nDivision was subjected to a number of changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n1. After having been part of the Army of the South, on the Bug, the\r\n101st Division was identified on the Serbian frontier at the end of May\r\nand the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA-POLAND.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of June it was brought back to Galicia by way of Budapest\r\nand Stry and took part in the German offensive in Galicia, in Poland. It\r\nwas on the Dniester on June 30 and on the Zlota-Lipa on July 20.\r\n\r\nIt was in the neighborhood of Lublin on August 12, at Siedlce on the\r\n29th and advanced up to a position near Brest-Litowsk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n3. Chosen to participate in the offensive against Serbia, it was\r\nentrained at Warsaw and went into action on the Serbian front on October\r\n7. It was at Nish on December 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1916, the 101st Division was still in Serbia\r\nand with the 103d Division formed the 4th Reserve Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACEDONIA.\r\n\r\n2. In February it was in front of Monastir.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARDAR.\r\n\r\n3. In March, together with the 103d Division, it was near the Greek\r\nfrontier in the Vardar Valley (Guevgueli) (March to November). In August\r\nit supported the 5th Bulgarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERNA.\r\n\r\n4. In November the 45th and the 146th Regiments occupied the bend of the\r\nCerna, while the 59th Regiment continued to hold the left bank of the\r\nVardar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACEDONIA.\r\n\r\n1. The Division was materially changed in 1917. The 45th was replaced by\r\nthe 11th Grenadiers, which had in November, 1916, left the 11th Division\r\nin France to join the Hippel Division in front of Monastir. In June the\r\n59th Regiment was withdrawn from the division and sent to the Roumanian\r\nfront. It was replaced by the 9th Jaeger Regiment.\r\n\r\n2. The 101st Division was kept on the Macedonian front (Vardar Valley,\r\nDoiran, Monastir) to the end of 1917, seemingly after that it breaks up.\r\nThe 146th Infantry was still in the vicinity of Monastir in December and\r\nwas reported as being sent toward Constantinople and Palestine (March,\r\n1918). In March, 1918, the 9th Regiment of Jaegers arrived in Alsace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division is rated as third class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\nThe 101st Division is considered as consisting of a divisional staff\r\nonly, administering Bulgarian units.

The 103d Division was next sent to the Somme (detrained at Bohain,\r\nOct. 8). It was engaged between Bouchavesnes and the St. Pierre-Vaast\r\nwood (Oct. 15 to Nov. 10). The 116th Reserve Regiment was particularly\r\nput to the test.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n9. After a few days’ rest the division came back to Champagne (Nov. 13).\r\nIt occupied the Souain sector (Nov. 15 to Jan. 15, 1917). While there\r\nwas engaged only in a few local raids. In December and January it\r\nreceived important reenforcements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. The 103d Division in January, 1917, went to the Verdun front\r\n(Samogneux-Louvemont). It stayed there four months and was always on the\r\ndefensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved on May 23, the division was transferred to the Aisne. It\r\nheld the Chemin des Dames sector (Malmaison, Les Bovettes, Panthéon, La\r\nRoyère) from May 26 to October 11–12. It only participated in the\r\nattacks of June 6 and July 8 as supporting troops and as a result\r\nsuffered but slight losses during that period.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved from the Aisne front on October 11 the 103d Division was\r\nsent to rest in the region of Sissonne. It seems to have been\r\ntransferred on October 24 toward the north of the Ailette as an\r\nattacking division.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest at the end of November and the first two weeks of\r\nDecember in the vicinity of Origny-Ste. Benoite, the division took over\r\nthe sector of Itancourt (Dec. 27–28) near St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 32d Regiment and the 71st Regiment, recruited in Thuringen and\r\nHesse-Electoral, and the 116th Reserve Regiment in the Grand Duchy of\r\nHesse. Although the 3d Batallion of the 85th Landwehr was transferred to\r\nthe 116th as 3d Batallion of this unit, its recruiting was a great deal\r\nless from the 9th Corps District than from the 18th Corps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe showing made by the 103d Division in the conflicts in which it was\r\nengaged warrants its being classed among the good units. Its losses in\r\n1917 were comparatively small. Its strength was gradually made up of\r\nyounger men by the transfer from it of the older soldiers. It was\r\nclassed as an attack division by the German Command. A secret order of\r\nthe 103d Division of September 20, 1917, contains the following: “Our\r\ndivision, which was specially trained for offensive work, and which is\r\ndesignated as an attack division (Angriffs division), is, in an\r\noffensive, very superior to the adversary * * *.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in line south of St. Quentin on March 21 as the left\r\ndivision of Von Conta group. It advanced toward Vendeuil without meeting\r\ngreat resistance and reached there at midnight. The 22d it reached the\r\nCrozat Canal and crossed at Liezon the next day. Placed in reserve on\r\nthe 23d, it followed the general advance by Villequier-Aumont (24th),\r\nQuesmy (25th), Lagny (27th). On the 28th the division captured the\r\nDives-Lassigny road and relieved the 36th Division in that vicinity. It\r\nattacked Plemont on March 30, but was unable to maintain its position\r\nand fell back on April 1, after heavy losses. It was relieved about\r\nApril 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. About April 27 the division relieved the 108th Division at Corbeny.\r\nIt was still in line when the attack of May 27 started and advanced to\r\nthe Marne northwest of Chatillon via Romigny, Vandieres, Bois de\r\nMareuil. It was relieved by the 22d Division between June 24 and 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n3. It rested near Fismes until it reentered line about July 14 in the\r\nsector Anthenay-Bois de Trottes. It was engaged until about August 1,\r\nwhen it was withdrawn from the battle front southwest of Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested at Malmaison until August 22, when it was engaged\r\nnorth of St. Aubin. In that locality it remained in line until about\r\nSeptember 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 26 the division entered line in Champagne, relieving the\r\n202d Division in the area south of Fontaine en Dornmeois. It received\r\nthe full weight of the French attack and in four days in line lost more\r\nthan 2,000 prisoners, including 6 battalion commanders.\r\n\r\n6. After three weeks of rest, elements of the division were reengaged\r\nsouthwest of Longwe on October 24. Other elements were identified in the\r\nsector of the 76th Reserve Division and the 2d Landwehr Division, near\r\nthe junction of the American and French Armies. Elements continued to be\r\nidentified in this general locality until the armistice. Most of the\r\ndivision appeared to have been opposed to the French Army. The last\r\nidentification was at Sedan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. At the end its effectives were\r\ngreatly reduced. Discontent over their prolonged service in line had\r\nlowered the morale of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            105th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │209.          │21.           │209.          │21.\r\n              │              │122 Fus.      │              │122 Fus.\r\n              │              │129.          │              │129.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Mounted Jag.

At the outset it\r\ncomprised the 122d Regiment of Fusileers obtained from the 26th Division\r\n(13th Corps District), the 21st Infantry from the 35th Division, and the\r\n129th Infantry from the 36th Division (17th Corps District).\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the 400th replaced the 122d Regiment (Wurttemberg).\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1915, the 105th Division appeared on the Serbian front at\r\nthe same time as the 101st and 103d Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of June it was transferred to Galicia via Budapest and\r\nStry. It participated in the offensive against the Russians on the Gnila\r\nLipa from June 24 to July 1, on the Zlota Lipa July 20. From Galicia it\r\nwent to Poland; fought at Krasnostaw at the end of July and between\r\nWieprz and the Jaselda until August 20. At the end of August it was on\r\nthe Chtchertchev-Brest-Kobryn railway front.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA AND BULGARIA.\r\n\r\n3. Chosen for the Serbian campaign, it again found itself in company\r\nwith the 101st and 103d Divisions and went into line on the Serbian\r\nfront in October but did not stay there long. While the 122d fusileers\r\npushed on in the south of this country, the 21st and the 129th entrained\r\nin December for Eastern Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIA.\r\n\r\n1. Assigned to watch the Roumanian frontier and the coast of the Black\r\nSea, the 21st went to Varna and the 129th from Choumla to the coast.\r\nThis mission did not end until May, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACEDONIA.\r\n\r\n2. At this time the division was being re-formed in Macedonia, where the\r\nthree regiments were again together at the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. The June Russian offensive was responsible for its return to Galicia\r\nand at the end of the month it was in Bukovina. The 105th Division\r\noperated in the region of Kolomea (end of June, beginning of July) and\r\nsuffered heavy losses. The 122d fusileers reported 26 officers and 1,165\r\nmen out of action. The division next fought in Galicia to the east of\r\nStanislau in July and August (east of Tlumacz-Tysmienica), to the east\r\nof Halicz in September.\r\n\r\n4. The division remained in the vicinity of Halicz until October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from Galicia, the division was sent to Courland, to the\r\nsouth of Kekkau (October).\r\n\r\n6. On October 20 it took over the sector to the west of Jakobstadt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAKOBSTADT.\r\n\r\n1. The 105th Division occupied the Jacobstadt front until November,\r\n1917. In April the 400th Regiment replaced the 122d which was\r\ntransferred to the 243d Division (old 8th Ersatz Division), a\r\nWurttemberg unit. The division took Jacobstadt on September 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. On November 5 the 105th Division entrained at Mitau and was\r\ntransported to France. (Itinerary: Kovno-Koenigsberg-Schneidemuehl-\r\nBerlin-Cassel-Coblenz-Treves-Thionville-Sedan-Mezieres.) It detrained at\r\nJuniville (south of Rethel) on November 11 and rested in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 21st and the 129th were classified as “troops from Western Prussia”\r\nin an official document. Although the 21st was called the 4th\r\nPomeranian, it was actually recruited for the most part in the Province\r\nof Western Prussia, which was its station in peace time. The 400th was,\r\nby reason of its replacement depot, a Rhenish unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 105th Division was first put into line on the French front at the\r\nbeginning of January, 1918. It suffered losses in Galicia during the\r\nSummer of 1916.\r\n\r\nIts long stay in the Courland sector had not increased its combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was engaged west of Noyon on April 15 and remained in\r\nthat area until May 17, when it was relieved by the 223d Division.\r\nLosses were very considerable in the early part of the division’s\r\noccupation of that sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON.\r\n\r\n2. It rested north of Noyon until May 31 when it reenforced the Aisne\r\nbattle front at Nampcel, east of the Oise. Throughout June it was\r\nengaged in this sector. It attempted a local attack on Moulin sous\r\nTouvent on July 3 without success. In minor operations in June and July\r\nthe division lost about 1,000 prisoners. In August it was heavily\r\nengaged and forced back on Noyon, where it was relieved by the 54th\r\nDivision about September 1.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested for about three weeks in the area south of Ferte\r\nChevresis-Montigny sur Crecy. It was engaged at Septvaux about September\r\n27. It fought in the retreat through Fourdrain as far as Mesbrecourt-\r\nAssis sur Serre. It held that sector until the capture of Mesbrecourt on\r\nOctober 22, after which it took up a position to the north. The division\r\nwas in the neighborhood of Pargny wood until November 5. Thereafter it\r\nwas identified at Vervins (6th), Voulpaix (7th), north of Wimy (9th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. As a sector holding division it\r\nsaw almost constant service most of which was in the Noyon area.

The division took part in the battles near Lemberg (June 17–22).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n2. In July the division was engaged near the Bug, in the vicinity of\r\nGrubeszow (July 19–30).\r\n\r\n3. On July 31 it fought to the northeast of Cholm. It was near Wlodawa\r\nfrom August 13 to 17.\r\n\r\n4. On August 25 and 26 it participated in the taking of Brest-Litowsk.\r\nIt entered Pinsk on September 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA.\r\n\r\n5. From Pinsk it operated against Serbia, staying there from the\r\nbeginning of October to the end of November, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1916, the division was in reserve in the vicinity of\r\nDvinsk, where it remained until March 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTAVY-SMORGONI.\r\n\r\n2. On March 18 it took over the sector to the north of Postavy. From May\r\nto June 20 it was near Smorgoni. At the end of the month it was assigned\r\nto meet the Russian offensive in Volhynia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n3. It was engaged between the Styr and the Stokhod from June 21 until\r\nthe middle of July.\r\n\r\n4. In August and September it was still in Volhynia, near the Kovel-\r\nRovno railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOVEL.\r\n\r\n5. The division stayed in this region and occupied the sector west of\r\nKachovka until the beginning of November, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. Relieved about November 9, 1917, from the Kovel sector, the 107th\r\nDivision entrained on the 13th at Poginski for the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary: Kovel-Brest-Litovsk-Warsaw-Posen-Frankfort on the Oder-\r\nBerlin-Cassel-Coblenz-Treves-Thionville-Sedan-Charleville-Hirson.) It\r\ndetrained east of Cambrai on the 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n2. From November 21 on it was engaged to the southwest of Cambrai\r\n(Noyelles-Rumilly).\r\n\r\n3. It was retired from the front about the end of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 52d Reserve Regiment remained a Brandenburger regiment, as at time\r\nof its formation. The 227th Reserve Regiment, formed in the 5th Corps\r\nDistrict at the end of 1915, had a majority of effectives from the 4th\r\nCorps District and still received replacements from Prussian Saxony. On\r\nthe other hand, the 232d Reserve Regiment, formed in the 4th Corps\r\nDistrict, recruited principally in Hanover (10th Corps District). The\r\n107th Division had hence a heterogeneous organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The division remained in line in the Gonnelieu sector until about\r\nFebruary 15, when it was relieved by the 18th Division from “B” Army and\r\nwent into reserve. On March 1 it returned and relieved the 18th Division\r\nin its former sector at Gonnelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was still in line when the offensive of March 21 began and\r\nadvanced via Mesnil to Avelny wood under the 39th Corps. It was relieved\r\non April 16 by the 16th Reserve Division near Anthuille and went to rest\r\nnear Cambrai.\r\n\r\n3. On May 16 the division came into line at Morlancourt, relieving the\r\n199th Division, and held that sector until the night of May 23–24. It\r\nrested in the Cambrai area until its return to line at Morlancourt on\r\nthe night of June 20–21. It was withdrawn about August 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. When the British began the attack on August 8 the division hastily\r\nreturned to line near Proyart. Until the 28th it was hotly engaged at\r\nProyart, Mericourt, and Herleville. One thousand seven hundred prisoners\r\nwere taken from the division in this fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n5. On September 3 the division started for Metz to rest. Its destination\r\nwas changed and it detrained at Conflans on September 16, marched via\r\nFrianville-Brainville-Allamont-Moulotte to Harville, where it went into\r\nline. The sector was a quiet one, and the battalions were well rested.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division left that sector on October 11 and went in trucks from\r\nConflans to Stenay via Longuyon-Montmedy-Sedan. By way of Dun sur Meuse\r\nthe division entered the line on October 14. One regiment had previously\r\nentered line on the 11th. Until the 20th the division was engaged in\r\nresisting without especial success the American attack. Two of the\r\nregiments of the division were out of the line from the 20th to November\r\n1. The total losses of the division up to this time were estimated at\r\n2,100, including 352 prisoners. Two regiments of the division were again\r\nengaged from November 1 to 10 in the Villers area, when the division was\r\nconsidered withdrawn following a failure to identify it by contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. There was evidence that the\r\nmorale of the men was low as a result of the heavy casualties that the\r\ndivision suffered throughout 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            108th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │(?)           │97.           │(?)           │97.\r\n              │              │137.          │              │137.\r\n              │              │265 Res.      │              │265 Res.\r\n              │              │              │         14 Jag.

It was called the Beckmann Division in\r\nhonor of its commanding general before it received the number 108.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. About December 1 it went into line to the west of Sventen Lake\r\n(region of Dvinsk).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1916, the division was transferred to Volhynia and opposed\r\nthe Russian offensive in the vicinity of Svinioukhi. Here it had heavy\r\nlosses. On June 16 the 1st Battalion of the 137th Infantry reported 24\r\nofficers and 978 men out of action. (Casualty List).\r\n\r\n2. It was in this sector until its departure for the Western Front\r\n(middle of December, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. Entrained on December 12 in the vicinity of Brest-Litowsk.\r\n\r\n2. Detrained near Hirson about December 18 and stayed at rest for three\r\nweeks in the vicinity of Aubenton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 97th and the 137th of the old 21st Corps were among those regiments\r\nwhich did not find a sufficient source of recruits in their home\r\nstations and filled up their ranks with soldiers from the Rhine Province\r\nand Westphalia.\r\n\r\nThe 265th Reserve Regiment, originally recruited from the Hanseatic\r\ncities, was now principally recruited in Mecklenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 108th Division, coming from Russia, only went in line on the Western\r\nFront on January 1, 1918.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, 1918, the 137th and 97th still had in its ranks\r\nmany men from Alsace and Lorraine, which must have been transferred\r\nshortly thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. After having had some training in the Vervins area, the 108th\r\nDivision relieved the 5th Reserve Division near Corbeny (northeast of\r\nCraonne) during the night of January 22–23. It was relieved about the\r\n21st of April by the 103d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. On the 30th it relieved the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division near\r\nVillers-Bretonneux (south of Corbie). During the night of May 19–20 it\r\nextended its front to the south and relieved the jaeger division. It was\r\nrelieved by the 41st Division on the 9th of July, and went to rest in\r\nthe Cappy area, south of the Somme.\r\n\r\n3. On the 7th of August it relieved the 43d Reserve Division astride the\r\nSomme (west of Bray). The next day the British captured 1576 men from\r\nthe division. It was withdrawn from line about the 23d. It went to the\r\nCambrai region, and was there disbanded—the 137th Regiment was\r\ntransferred to the 15th Division, the 97th Regiment to the 202d\r\nDivision, and the 265th Reserve Regiment was dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 108th was rated a third-class division, but considering that\r\nalthough it was trained in assault tactics (in January) it was not used\r\nin any of the German offensives, and that the only heavy fighting in\r\nwhich it participated was when it was caught by the British attack of\r\nthe 8th of August, where it fought poorly, and also that the 15th and\r\n202d Divisions—the units which received its regiments when it was\r\ndisbanded—were second and third class, respectively, this rating seems\r\nto have been too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            109th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │174.          │2 Gren.       │174.          │2 Gren.\r\n              │              │26 Res.       │              │26 Res.\r\n              │              │376.          │              │376.\r\n              │              │              │   4 Btn.

In the first two days of the British attack the\r\ndivision lost 1,544 prisoners. After its withdrawal the division was\r\ntaken to the vicinity of Trelon and disbanded.\r\n\r\n2. The 26th Reserve Regiment was drafted to the 36th Fusileer Regiment\r\nand the 66th Regiment to the 113th Division. The 2d Grenadier Regiment\r\npassed intact from the 109th Division to the 3d Reserve Division.

About the middle of April, 1915, the 111th Division was in line along\r\nthe Cotes de Meuse (Calonne, Hattonchatel trench) after having detrained\r\non April 11 at Mars la Tour.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. In August it was transferred to Artois (Monchy au Bois sector).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 111th Division stayed on the Artois front until August, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. About August 21 it was relieved and sent to the north of the Somme.\r\nEngaged near Guillemont and Guinchy, it suffered serious losses (Aug.\r\n25-Sept. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n3. After a few days’ rest in the Cambrai region it was put into line\r\nnear Cotes de Meuse (Bois de Chevaliers, Sept. 15) and stayed there\r\nuntil October 26. It was brought up to strength by the addition of 2,000\r\nreplacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of October it was brought back to the Somme. At first it\r\nwas at rest in the region of Bohain and then took over a sector between\r\nBouchavesnes and the St. Pierre-Vaast wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, it was south of the Somme near Barleux, from which\r\nposition it was relieved a short time before it fell back on the\r\nHindenberg Line.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n2. It occupied the Bellicourt sector (north of St. Quentin) from May 10\r\nto about June 24. On May 7 and 15 it received 600 replacements (classes\r\nof 1917 and 1918) to make up the losses sustained on April 27 at Arleux\r\nen Gohelle.\r\n\r\n3. The division was then put at rest for a month in the vicinity of\r\nCambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n4. It entrained on July 25 and 26 and was transported to Flanders, where\r\nit was engaged on the 27th and 28th to the north of Ypres(Boesinghe-\r\nSteenstraat). It met the artillery preparation and the attack of July\r\n31, which caused it considerable losses. It was relieved the very night\r\nof the attack and was temporarily reorganized at Bohain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n5. Sent to Lorraine, it took the Regnieville sector (west of Pont à\r\nMousson) about August 20; rested and reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. It left this sector on October 14 to return to Flanders\r\n(Poelcappelle). It detrained on the 16th at Alost and was engaged from\r\nthe 22d to the 26th and relieved November 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n7. From the end of November to January 8, 1918, it held the Monchy le\r\nPreuxen-Vis en Artois sector (southeast of Arras). The division received\r\nthe remaining necessary replacements; the 73d Fusileers received, on\r\nDecember 24, 400 men between the ages of 20 and 35, taken from the\r\nRussian front (especially from the 15th Landwehr Division).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 76th Infantry was a Hanseatic unit while the 73d Fusileers was a\r\nHanoverian organization. As men from the 9th Corps District quite\r\nfrequently served in regiments from the 10th Corps District and\r\nreciprocally, in case of necessity, the regiments of a division drew\r\nwithout distinction from either source, it was to be expected that the\r\n111th Division was termed as “regiments of Lower Saxony.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 111th Division, which was considered a good unit, was sorely tried\r\nin Flanders by the Franco-British attack of July 31, 1917. Many men left\r\ntheir formations either when going into line or under bombardment. The\r\ndivision stayed but four days in line and had to be relieved without\r\nhaving been able to counterattack. The 111th Division was composed of\r\nyoung men, part of whom had experience in very active sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved by the 234th Division at Arleux about the\r\n1st of March. It remained in rear of the front until March 21 when it\r\nreturned to its former sector to attack east of St. Leger. It had been\r\nresting at Auberchicourt, which place it left on the 17th and marched\r\nvia Palluel to Villers lez Cagnicourt, arriving there on March 20.\r\n\r\nThe division was in the first wave of the attack and advanced via\r\nEcoust, then south to Vaulx-Vraucourt on the 22d, Mory (24th). It passed\r\ninto second line about this time and reentered line north of\r\nHamelincourt on April 1 to relieve the 26th Division. After a week it\r\nside-slipped south and relieved the 239th Division northeast of Ayette,\r\nwhich sector it held until April 20. It was relieved by the 234th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n2. On May 6 the division relieved the 5th Bavarian Division north of\r\nBucquoy. It continued to hold this sector until August 17, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 4th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. The division taken from the comparatively quiet Bucquoy sector was\r\nused to reenforce the battle front at Favreuil on August 25. It was only\r\nengaged four days in this sector. Withdrawn on the 29th, it moved\r\nnorthward and on September 2 reenforced the front east of Hendecourt. It\r\nfought then for three days before it was withdrawn. In these two brief\r\nperiods in line the division suffered very heavy casualties besides\r\nlosing 500 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested in the Tourcoing area until it reentered line\r\nsouth of Acheville on the night of September 24–25 in relief of the\r\n207th Division. It was engaged here until October 11, when the 49th\r\nReserve Division relieved it east of Lens.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested in the Douchy-Haspres area in support until\r\nOctober 18, when it moved to Artres and came into line on the night of\r\nOctober 20–21 at Monchaux sur Ecaillon. Until November 7 the division\r\nwas constantly in line. It was near Vendegies until October 24, and\r\nlater at Arties (28th), Farmars (29th), Jenlain (Nov. 2), Sebourg (4th),\r\nwest of Risin (5th), and near St. Amand (5th). It was out of line at the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as an assault\r\ndivision on the Somme in March, but thereafter served as an intervention\r\ndivision in the Somme area. The division showed considerable power of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            113th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │225.          │36 Fus.       │225.          │36 Fus.\r\n              │              │48.           │              │48.\r\n              │              │32 Res.       │              │32 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │             (?)             │3 Sqn. 8 Cuirassier Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │225 F.

Its three\r\ninfantry regiments were taken from old divisions: the 48th from the 5th\r\nDivision (3d Corps District-Brandenburg), the 36th from the 8th Division\r\n(4th Corps District-Prussian Saxony), and the 32d Reserve from the 22d\r\nReserve Division (11th Corps District-Thuringe).\r\n\r\nIn March, 1917, the 48th was replaced by the 66th Regiment (old 7th\r\nDivision from Prussian Saxony) taken from the 52d Division.\r\n\r\n1. Detraining at Conflans on April 8, the division spent a few days in\r\nthe Woevre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. It appeared along the Côtes de Meuse (Calonne trench) on April 26,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n3. From that date until January 14, 1916, it stayed around the Côtes de\r\nMeuse and in Woevre-Calonne trench, Ailly wood, St. Mihiel, Eparges, and\r\nBois Bouchot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. January and February, 1916, rested at Brainville and Conflans.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. On February 24 the 113d Division was transferred to the Verdun front.\r\nIt participated in the attacks of the 8th and 9th of March against the\r\nvillage of Douaumont and suffered considerable losses. In six weeks\r\nspent around Douaumont the losses are said to have been 30 officers and\r\n2,000 men put out of action (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the beginning of April it was put into line in a calm\r\nsector—region of Soissons, then in the region of the Oise (Tracy le Val,\r\nPuisaleine).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. In July, at the beginning of the Franco-British offensive, it\r\ndetached some of its elements in the Somme (Peronne, July 1, then at\r\nFrise, Assevillers, and Belloy). The three rest battalions of the\r\ndivision formed in an emergency an assembled regiment (notebook).\r\n\r\n5. After a new stay in the Soissons region (August and September) the\r\nwhole division was again engaged in the Somme between Rancourt and the\r\nSt. Pierre-Vaast wood. It suffered very heavy losses near Bouchavesnes\r\n(Oct. 1–10).\r\n\r\n6. At rest from October 14 to 21 in Woevre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n7. At the end of October, the 113th Division took over the Bonzee-\r\nRonvaux sector (Côtes de Meuse).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 113th Division stayed around the Côtes de Meuse until the end of\r\nJanuary, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of February it went into Alsace and occupied a\r\nsector between the Thur and the Rhone-Rhine canal (March).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n3. On April 21 it was hastily entrained at Mulhouse and transferred to\r\nthe Aisne. It went into line on the 26th at Chemin des Dames and met the\r\nsecond French offensive in the Courtecon-Malval farm region (May 5).\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GOBAIN FOREST.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved in the middle of May, it stayed at rest for six days in the\r\nvicinity of Assis sur Serre and thereafter in a sector in the St. Gobain\r\nforest (Deuillet-Fresnes).\r\n\r\n5. On August 10 it was put at rest behind Laon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAONNE.\r\n\r\n6. It went back into line at the end of September in the Craonne sector.\r\nAs a result of the French offensive it fell back to the east of\r\nHurtebise where it was relieved about November 10.\r\n\r\n7. It rested in the Laon region from the middle of November to January\r\n20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the division took on a distinctly provincial aspect, its\r\nregiments receiving replacements from Prussian Saxony (the 36th\r\nFusileers and the 66th Infantry) and in Thuringe (the 32d Reserve\r\nRegiment).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 113th Division was a good unit. It put up an energetic resistance on\r\nthe Chemin des Dames on May 5, 1917. From that time up to the offensive\r\nof March, 1918, it had not been seriously engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. Having finished its training in the Sissonne region, the 113th\r\nDivision relieved the 235th Division about the middle of January in the\r\nJuvincourt sector (east of Craonne), and was itself relieved by the 5th\r\nReserve Division on the 21st of February. It trained for a week at\r\nVervins, and then moved to Wassigny, where it underwent more training\r\nuntil the 16th of March, when it marched via Bohain and Fonsommes to\r\nBellicourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n2. On the 21st it attacked in the first line near Maissemy (northwest of\r\nSt. Quentin). Although suffering very heavy losses, the division had\r\nsucceeded in pushing on as far as St. Christ-Briost and Pargny (on the\r\nSomme) on the 24th. It was withdrawn shortly after (probably on the\r\n26th).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 27th of May the division reenforced the Aisne front near\r\nCraonne and attacked in the first line. It was withdrawn about the 14th\r\nof June and went to rest near Conde sur Aisne (east of Soissons).\r\n\r\n4. The division reenforced the front near Troissy (east of Dormans) on\r\nthe 15th of July. It was caught in the confusion caused by the Allied\r\ncounteroffensive, and was forced to retire. It was not identified after\r\nthe 22d, and so it seems as though it was not in line after that date\r\nuntil prisoners were again taken on the 29th near Villers-Agron\r\n(southeast of Fere en Tardenois), which is in a line almost due north of\r\nwhere it had previously been engaged. Here it took over the part of the\r\nline previously held by the 2d Guard Division. It was withdrawn early in\r\nAugust and went to rest in the region southeast of Maubeuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n5. On the 10th of September the division reenforced the front near Metz\r\nen Couture (southwest of Cambrai). It was withdrawn from line near\r\nVillers-Plouich (southwest of Cambrai) after having lost over 1,600\r\nprisoners about the 2d of October, and went to rest east of Denain.\r\n\r\n6. On the 22d it came back into line near Douchy (south of Denain). Two\r\ndays later it side-slipped toward the south. It was identified in line\r\nto the north of Le Quesnoy in November, but was withdrawn a day or two\r\nlater. It did not return to line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 113th was rated as a second-class division. Although the division\r\ncommander received Pour le Merite and the commander of the 36th Regiment\r\nwas also decorated after the battle of the Somme, the division does not\r\nappear to have particularly distinguished itself there. On the whole,\r\nhowever, its conduct though not brilliant was dependable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            115th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │229.          │136.          │229.          │136.\r\n              │              │171.          │              │171.\r\n              │              │40 Res.       │              │40 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 and 2 Sqn. 22 Dragoon Rgt. │1 and 2 Sqn. 22 Dragoon Rgt.\r\n              │  (one-half picked troops).  │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │229 F.

In April, 1915, the 115th Division was in reserve in the Tournai-\r\nCourtrai region.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. In May it was sent as a reenforcement to the north of Arras and\r\nfought at Notre Dame de Lorette and Neuville St. Vaast and was sorely\r\ntried. The infantry losses amounted to 128 officers and 5,208 men out of\r\naction (Casualty List), of which 47 officers and 2,258 men belonged to\r\nthe 171st Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about June 15, the 115th Division took over the Missy sur\r\nAisne sector (east of Soissons), which it occupied until the last days\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of July it was transferred to the Eastern Front, and for a\r\ntime in August operated on the Narew.\r\n\r\n5. It took part in the summer offensive. It was before Kovno on August\r\n19, in the region of Vileiki at the end of September, and near Narotch\r\nLake at the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTAVY-NAROTCH LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. The 115th Division occupied the Postavy-Narotch Lake sector until the\r\nbeginning of August, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. About August 2 the division was transferred to Galicia. It was\r\nengaged to the west of Zalosce (south of Brody), August to September.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n3. In October it was in line in Volhynia to the west of Loutsk\r\n(Sviniouki). The 171st was kept to the southwest of Brody with the\r\nMelior detachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of December the 115th Division was transferred from\r\nVolhynia to Roumania, where, together with the 109th Division, it made\r\nup the 54th Corps, which operated between Buzeu and the Danube.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 115th Division took a position on the Roumanian\r\nfront to the south of Namoloasa and stayed in this sector until the\r\nmiddle of August.\r\n\r\n2. It was then in line to the north of Focsani, in the Panciu-Marasesti\r\nregion (August-December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchy of Baden and the Rhenish countries supplied the greater\r\npart of the recruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on the Roumanian front on February 1 by an\r\nAustrian division and rested in the Braila area during February and\r\nMarch. On April 8 it entrained and traveled via Budapest-Vienna-Prague-\r\nDresden-Coblenz-Cologne-Aachen-Liege-Brussels to Lille, when it\r\ndetrained about April 18. About the 21st the division reentrained and\r\nwas railed to Antwerp, where it went through a course of intensive\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\nThe division left Antwerp on May 21 and traveled via Brussels-Mons-\r\nMaubeuge-Le Cateau-Bohain, detraining north of St. Quentin on May 22.\r\nFour days later it continued its journey by rail to Versigny, southeast\r\nof La Fere, and was billeted in the Crepy area until May 29. On the\r\nfollowing day it left and marched via Chaillevoois-Vailly (May 31)-\r\nAmbrief (June 1)-Villers-Helon (2d) and relieved the 37th Division near\r\nLongpont on the Aisne battle front on the night of June 2–3. It\r\nwithstood the Allied counterthrust at Corcy in July, suffering heavy\r\nlosses. It was relieved on the night of July 19–20.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. The division was moved to Brieulles and in the first days of August\r\nrelieved the 22d Reserve Division in the sector Malancourt-Forges. In\r\nthis vicinity it remained until September 19, when it was relieved by\r\nthe 7th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the second day of the American attack the division returned to\r\nbolster up the line in the Gesnes area. The division now included the\r\n173d Regiment, which came from the 223d Division (dissolved) to supplant\r\nthe 40th Reserve Regiment (disbanded). The division took part in the\r\nseveral captures and recaptures of Gesnes. It fought hard and suffered\r\nheavy losses before its relief on October 12 by the 3d Guard Division.\r\nTwo days later it came back to support the 3d Guard Division and was\r\nengaged in the fighting around Romagne until October 18.

Its three regiments were obtained from the 6th Corps and the 6th\r\nReserve Corps—the 157th Infantry from the 12th Division, the 11th\r\nReserve Regiment from the 11th Reserve Division, and the 22d Reserve\r\nRegiment from the 12th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n1. In April, 1915, the 117th Division was in Champagne (region of\r\nChâtelet).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS-NOTRE DAME DE LORETTE.\r\n\r\n2. Transferred to Artois, it was engaged to the north of Souchez and at\r\nNotre Dame de Lorette (May and June). In this fighting it was hard hit,\r\n107 officers and 5,255 men out of action, of whom 44 officers and 2,161\r\nmen belong to the 11th Infantry. (Casualty List.)\r\n\r\n3. The division was re-formed at the end of June in the region of Lille.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n4. Toward the middle of July it went back into line to the northwest of\r\nLens (from Vermelles to the Grenay-Lens railway). It suffered very heavy\r\nlosses in the attacks occurring at the end of September and the\r\nbeginning of October (Loos)—109 officers and 6,463 men out of action.\r\n(Casualty List.)\r\n\r\n5. Taken away from the Artois front in the middle of October, it was put\r\nat rest in the vicinity of Roubaix-Tourcoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. At the end of October it took over the Messines sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 117th Division occupied the Messines front until the beginning of\r\nMarch, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. Rest at Courtrai; instruction and training at the Beverloo Camp\r\n(March-April and May).\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of June the division went into line to the east of\r\nYpres (near the road from Ypres to Menin, and until July 20).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On July 23 it went to the Somme (Pozieres); it was engaged from the\r\nend of July to the middle of August.\r\n\r\n5. On August 17 the division entrained for the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUKOVINA.\r\n\r\n6. It was identified in the Carpathian Mountains as part of the 3d\r\nAustro-Hungarian Army (region of Jablonica, October).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n1. The 117th Division remained here (Jablonica, Worochta, Koeroesmezoe,\r\nJacobeni sectors) until the middle of May, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of May it was transferred via Maramaros-Sziget to the\r\nRoumanian front (Putna valley, region of Ocna, June-September). At rest\r\nin Transylvania in September and was there reequipped for mountain\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to Italy at the beginning of October, it was on the 24th behind\r\nTolmino as an army reserve. In December it was on the left bank of the\r\nPiave.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSilesian division, with recruits coming especially from Upper Silesia\r\n(mining district and mountainous districts), it was used on several\r\noccasions as mountain troops (Carpathians, Italy).\r\n\r\nOn the Carpathian, Roumanian, and Italian fronts (August, 1916-March,\r\n1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested in the vicinity of Vahl-Ebersing until April 6,\r\nwhen it entrained at St. Avold and moved to Lille. It went into billets\r\nnear there on the 7th and came into line near Neuve Eglise on April 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged in the Bailleul, Kemmel, and La Clyette area until the\r\n1st of May. After a few days in support, the division reentered west of\r\nDranoutre on May 4 and held that sector until mid-May.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested near La Madeleine. Its units were very much\r\nweakened. The 11th Reserve Regiment was disbanded about May 16 and\r\ntransferred its effectives to the other two regiments of the division.\r\nIt was replaced by the 11th Grenadier Regiment, which was brought from\r\nthe Macedonian front about May 21. The division remained at rest until\r\nabout June 3, when it was again reported in line near Voormezeele.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The division held that sector without event until June 25, when it\r\nwas withdrawn and sent to rest near Ghent. On August 4 it was moved by\r\nrail to Peronne, where it went into the Vrely-Hangest wood sector until\r\nAugust 18. In the British attack south of the Somme on August 8 the\r\ndivision lost about 2,700 prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn August 27 it reenforced the battle front at Maricourt for a couple of\r\ndays. It was withdrawn about September 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested and was reconstituted in rear of the Argonne\r\nfront in early September. The 22d Reserve Regiment suffered so heavily\r\non the Somme that it was dissolved and its men divided between the other\r\ntwo regiments. The 450th Regiment from the dissolved 233d Division\r\nreplaced the 22d Reserve Regiment in the division.\r\n\r\n6. About September 12, the division relieved the 37th Division in line\r\nnear Avocourt. It was swamped in the first drive of the American Army on\r\nSeptember 26. Elements kept up the fight until September 29, when they\r\nwere withdrawn after having been pressed back to about Cierges. Its\r\ndefense was not particularly vigorous, but was better than that of the\r\ndivisions on either side. Its total losses were estimated at 3,200,\r\nincluding 1,861 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n7. On November 2 the division returned to line just west of the Meuse.\r\nWhile resting at Juvigny the division received replacements. In the\r\nretreat it crossed to the east bank of the Meuse and was in line on the\r\nday of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second-class. Up to the middle of June the\r\ndivision seems to have been a holding rather than an attacking one.\r\nAfter the Somme battle in August its effectives were feeble and morale\r\nlow. It had many older men, returned wounded, and convalescents, and a\r\nlarge number of Poles and Alsatians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            119th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │237.          │46.           │237.          │46.\r\n              │              │58.           │              │58.\r\n              │              │46 Res.       │              │46 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │Wedel.

Formed in April, 1915. Its three regiments were obtained from\r\ndivisions belonging to the 5th Army—the 46th from the 10th Division, the\r\n58th from the 9th Division, and the 46th Reserve from the 10th Reserve\r\nDivision. Assembled in annexed Lorraine, it was sent to Galicia for the\r\nApril German offensive. The division took part in the battle of Gorlice\r\nat the end of the month.\r\n\r\n2. In July it was in Poland, west of the Wieprz, and at the end of\r\nOctober in the region of Baranovitchi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARANOVITCHI.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1916, the division held a sector to the east of\r\nBaranovitchi (Russia).\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH LAKE.\r\n\r\n2. About March 28 it went to Narotch Lake and opposed the Russian\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n3. Sorely tried on March 30, it was relieved on April 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n4. In May it was found at the west of Smorgoni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n5. It was transferred to Galicia at the end of June at the time of the\r\nRussian offensive. Engaged on July 27, it suffered heavy losses. The 1st\r\nBattalion of the 58th was almost entirely captured and the division\r\nretired 15 km. (letter). On August 7 new losses at Tlumacz. The division\r\nwas placed in reserve behind Stanislau until the beginning of September.\r\nOn September 6 it reappeared on the front in the region of Halicz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. The division stayed near Halicz until March 9, 1917. It was then sent\r\nto the vicinity of Brzezany, where it was almost immediately put in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of May it was sent to the Western Front. (Itinerary:\r\nBrzezany (May 3)-Lemberg-Breslau-Liegnitz-Dresden-Leipzig-Cassel-\r\nFrankfort-Aix la Chapelle-Liége-Brussels-Roulers (May 8).)\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. Ypres sector; went into line at the beginning of June and was\r\nrelieved on July 18.\r\n\r\n4. Bixschoote sector; went into line at the beginning of August. The\r\ndivision met the attack in Flanders, in which it suffered serious losses\r\non August 16. The 9th Company of the 58th Infantry was reduced to 38 men\r\n(notebook). On the 9th and 10th of October there were new engagements.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from the front on October 15 the division rested in the\r\nvicinity of Gand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. After a month’s rest the 119th Division went into line on the Cambrai\r\nfront to participate in the counterattacks which followed the surprise\r\nattack of November 20. It fought here from the 23d to the 27th, not\r\nwithout some losses.\r\n\r\n7. Relieved after December 6, the division was reorganized in the\r\nvicinity of Solesmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThis division recruited from the 5th Corps District. A document dated\r\nNovember 23, 1917, described the division as composed of “regiments of\r\nLower Silesia and Posen.” In order to overcome the majority of Poles,\r\nthe division received recruits from the 3d and 6th Corps Districts\r\n(Brandenburg and Silesia), which were fruitful sources of recruiting.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one per cent of the prisoners taken from the 119th Division in\r\nAugust, 1917, belonged to the 1917 class. The 1918 class was meagerly\r\nrepresented. The 46th Reserve Regiment had a large proportion of Poles.\r\nThe soldiers from Alsace-Lorraine remained on the Eastern Front when the\r\ndivision left Galicia (May, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. About the end of January the division was relieved near Pronville by\r\nthe 20th Division. It replaced the 3d Guard Division astride the\r\nBapaume-Cambrai road about February 12. The date of its relief in this\r\nsector is not known. A captured diary shows that the division was\r\ntraining in the Helesmes area (north of Denain) until the middle of\r\nMarch. On the 16th it marched to Noyelles sur Selle, and on the\r\nfollowing day reached Cambrai, where it remained until March 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. The division came into line near Inchy on the 21st and took part in\r\nthe initial attack. It was withdrawn on the 23d and rested two days. It\r\nreappeared in line on the 25th and fought southeast of Hebuterne until\r\nrelieved by the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division on April 7–8. The division\r\nlost heavily in this fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the Somme, the division reentered the Lys battle line\r\non April 26 near Locon. It was engaged there until early in May (6th),\r\nwhen it was withdrawn near Hinges and rested in the area Lille-Tournai\r\nuntil June 11. On that date it marched to Orchies, was railed to Le\r\nForest, and from there came into line via Noyelles, relieving the 12th\r\nReserve Division on the night of June 13–14. While at rest the division\r\nreceived a number of drafts, mostly of the 1919 class.\r\n\r\n4. The division held the Mericourt sector until the night of July 12–13,\r\nwhen it was relieved by the 52d Division and took over the billets of\r\nthe 52d Division in the Orchies area.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested until August 1, when it moved to Ham via Douai-\r\nCambrai-Caudry-Bohain-St. Quentin. Then it rested until August 8, when\r\nit was alarmed and rushed up in busses to the Le Quesnel sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n6. On August 9 the division was engaged south of the Somme. In the\r\nfighting it lost about 900 prisoners before its relief on August 17. On\r\nAugust 27–28 it returned to line in the Misery-Licourt sector and\r\nremained in line until September 24, when it was withdrawn from west of\r\nBellenglise. After a week’s rest the division reentered line at Estrees;\r\nwas engaged for 17 days in the Beaurevoir-Le Cateau area. Since August 8\r\nit has lost nearly 3,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested at Ghent until October 27, when it relieved the\r\n3d Landwehr Division south of Machelen. It retreated via Olsene to\r\nNazareth, in which area it was withdrawn about November 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as an attack\r\ndivision in the March and April offensives. While on the defensive in\r\nAugust and September on the Somme it was decimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            121st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │241.          │60.           │241.          │60.\r\n              │              │7 Res.        │              │7 Res.\r\n              │              │56 Res.       │              │56 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 and 3 Sqns. 12 Horse Jag.  │12 Horse Jag.

Its three regiments came from divisions which had been in\r\nexistence for some time. The 60th came from the 31st Division (21st\r\nCorps), the 7th Reserve from the 9th Reserve Division (5th Reserve\r\nCorps), and the 56th Reserve from the 13th Reserve Division (7th Reserve\r\nCorps). These regiments were brought together in the region of St.\r\nAvold-Faulquemont at the beginning of April and on the 9th reached\r\nThiaucourt, Euvezin, and the Mort Mare wood (notebooks).\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n1. The 121st Division next appeared in the Bois de Prêtre sector at the\r\nbeginning of May, 1915.\r\n\r\n2. It stayed there until the end of February, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The division left the Bois de Prêtre on March 1, 1916, and rested in\r\nthe vicinity of Metz.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. On March 15 it came to the Verdun front (north of Vaux). On April 1\r\nit attacked and took the village of Vaux; it again attacked on April 11\r\nand made progress between Vaux and Douaumont, paying dearly for the\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved from the Verdun front on April 20, it was put at rest near\r\nSt. Avold until May 15. It had lost 58 per cent of its infantry strength\r\nin front of Verdun. From March 18 to May 30 the 6th Company of the 7th\r\nReserve Regiment received no less than 192 replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Transferred to Péronne by way of Sedan, Charleville, Hirson, and\r\nBohain, the 121st Division went into line on the left bank of the Somme\r\non May 18.\r\n\r\n5. On July 1, while in this sector, it was surprised by the French\r\noffensive and suffered heavy losses (numerous prisoners).\r\n\r\n6. Relieved on July 4, it was put at rest and reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n7. On July 18 it entrained for the Eastern Front. (Itinerary: Aix la\r\nChapelle-Cologne-Thorn, Warsaw, and Brest-Litowsk.)\r\n\r\n\r\nKOVEL.\r\n\r\n8. Taking over the Kovel sector on July 26, it launched counterattacks,\r\nin which it was sorely tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH LAKE.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1917, the 121st Division left the Kovel\r\nsector to go into the region of Narotch Lake and stayed in the latter\r\nplace until May 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. On May 20 it entrained for France. (Itinerary: Vilna-Insterberg-\r\nAllenstein-Bromberg-Landsberg-Berlin-Stendal-Minden-Duesseldorf-Aix la\r\nChapelle-Verviere-Liége-Brussels-Audenarde.) It detrained at Elsegem on\r\nMay 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRÉSIS.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to Cambrai on June 10, it took over the Moruvres-\r\nAvrincourt sector, which it occupied from June 12 to the beginning of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. It was thereafter brought to the Ypres front to the south of the\r\nrailway running from Ypres to Roulers (Aug. 19). Artillery fire caused\r\nit to lose heavily; the British attack of September 20, of which it bore\r\nthe brunt, increased its losses. Before the battle of the 20th the 12th\r\nCompany of the 56th Reserve Regiment was reduced to 65 men, of whom 40\r\nwere men of the class of 1918. The 9th Company was entirely destroyed or\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved in the night of the 21st of September the division was sent\r\nto rest (region of Mars la Tour) and reorganized (more than 2,000 men\r\ncoming from the 605th and 614th Landstrum, Batallion X 12, and the 109th\r\nLandwehr). These replacements were very heterogeneous—soldiers from\r\nWestphalia, Hanover, Baden, Magdeberg (men previously wounded and\r\nconvalescents).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of October the 121st Division took over a sector\r\nnear Cotes de Meuse (les Éparges, Ravin de Malochis). It stayed there\r\nuntil about April 10, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe name “7th Brandenberger” for the 60th Infantry was only of historic\r\ninterest. The regiment recruited almost entirely in Westphalia. The 56th\r\nReserve Regiment was also recruited in Westphalia, and there were\r\nnumerous soldiers from there in the 7th Reserve Regiment to\r\ncounterbalance the numerous Poles in the 5th Corps District; hence the\r\nmake-up of the division was for the most part Westphalian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 121st Division fought very well in its last battle in Flanders\r\n(September, 1917) and was put to a good test.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1918, the number of men in the ranks who had taken part in\r\nthese attacks was about 35 or 40 per cent, and the replacements used\r\nafter the battle of Flanders were generally of inferior military value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved on the Woevre about April 11. It entrained\r\non April 24 at Conflans and traveled via Sedan-Charleville-Hirson-\r\nValenciennes to Pont a Marcq, where it detrained on April 26, after a\r\njourney of about 20 hours. It came into line in the Dranoutre sector on\r\nMay 2 in relief of the 10th Erzsatz Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCRE.\r\n\r\n2. It held the Locre sector until May 21, when it was relieved by the\r\n16th Bavarian Division. On June 19 it returned to its former sector at\r\nDranoutre and held it until July 7.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in the Tourcoing area until July 31, when it\r\nentrained and traveled via Courtrai-Valenciennes-St. Quentin to Laon,\r\nwhere it detrained on the following day. Here it rested until 5 p. m. on\r\nAugust 8, when it was alarmed and marched to the La Fere area (19\r\nmiles), arriving on the next day about 11 a. m. On the same day at 8 p.\r\nm. the division was again alarmed and was moved in motor busses via\r\nChauny-Noyon-Roye to the Damery area, where it arrived on the 10th of\r\nAugust about 10 a. m. and was immediately engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. The division fell back by Parvillers-Damery-Fresnoy-Cremery-Sept\r\nFours-Nesle to the east bank of the Somme Canal. It was relieved on the\r\nnight of September 1–2 by the 25th Reserve Division. The division lost\r\n800 prisoners in this fighting.\r\n\r\n5. It rested in early September in the Maretz area (southeast of\r\nCambrai). On September 18 it was hurried to the line and counterattacked\r\nat Bonyon that evening. Until October 1 it was engaged at Hargicourt,\r\nVilleret, and Le Catelet. After only four days of rest the division\r\nagain came into line on October 5 in the Gouy area. It was withdrawn to\r\nbe reorganized on October 9.\r\n\r\n6. After resting near Maubeuge the division returned to line west of\r\nCatillon on the night of October 18–19. It fought for about seven days\r\nbetween that place and Ors. On November 6 it was engaged at Maroilles\r\nand was in line near Limont-Fontaine on the day of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was an average division. In\r\nthe final campaign it showed no particular power of resistance and lost\r\nabnormally in prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             123d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │245.          │178.          │245.          │178.\r\n              │              │182.          │              │182.\r\n              │              │106 Res.      │              │106 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │5 Sqn. 20 Hus.

In October, 1916, the 182d\r\nRegiment was transferred to the 216th Division and was replaced by the\r\n425th Infantry, which was also transferred from this division in March,\r\n1917, and replaced by the 351st Regiment (Saxon).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. In May, 1915, the 123d Division occupied the region northwest of\r\nRheims.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of May it was transported to Lille, where it seems to have\r\nbeen transferred as a reserve; in the middle of June it was in the\r\nvicinity of Arras.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. It next occupied different sectors in Artois.\r\n\r\n4. In September it held the Souchez front. On October 8 it took part in\r\nthe attack on Loos and left Artois in the middle of that month.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. After a rest at Lille the division went to Flanders (November), where\r\nit held a sector south of the canal from Ypres to Comines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. In the middle of March, 1916, the 123d Division was put at rest near\r\nBruges.\r\n\r\n2. It was temporarily in line about April 9 at St. Éloi; then remained\r\nas a reserve to the armies in the vicinity of Menin and Courtrai until\r\nJuly 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At this date it was transferred to the Somme and fought near\r\nHardecourt and Maurepas until July 22, losing more than 6,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of August, 1916, the 123d Division left the Western\r\nFront for the Russian front.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH LAKE.\r\n\r\n5. It went into line in the region of Narotch Lake about September.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAROTCH LAKE-MITAU.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1917, the 106th Reserve Regiment was detached\r\nas a reenforcement in the Mitau sector, which was menaced by a Russian\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIn March the 425th Infantry (Prussian) was exchanged for the 351st\r\nInfantry, which had been grouped under this number since 1915, and was\r\noriginally three battalions of the Saxon replacement depot of the old\r\nwar garrison of Breslau.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n2. In the middle of August the division, which up to that time had held\r\nthe Narotch Lake sector, was engaged between Smorgoni and Krevo.\r\n\r\n3. It again returned to the Narotch Lake vicinity in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n4. About November 8 it was transferred to France. (Itinerary: Chavli-\r\nVarsovie-Lodz-Kalich-Cottbus-Cassel-Frankfort on the Main-Sarrebrueck-\r\nMetz). It detrained at Piennes, Baroncourt, and was billeted in that\r\ndistrict for eight days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n5. About November 22 it took over a sector on the Verdun front (south of\r\nBezonvaux). It stayed there all winter. It was identified to the\r\nsoutheast of Damloup in February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSince March, 1917, there have been but Saxons in the 123d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 123d Division had but a mediocre combat value by reason of its long\r\nstay in calm sectors on the Russian front.\r\n\r\nIn Russia it fraternized on two occasions, the second one at the time of\r\nits last stay on the Russian front.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the division on the Russian front were almost nothing and\r\nit suffered no losses on the Verdun front until February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. The division continued to hold the uneventful Bezonvaux sector until\r\nJune 3, when it was relieved by the 7th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n2. On the night of June 18–19 it relieved the 232d Division north of the\r\nBligny (southwest of Rheims). It participated in the attack of July 15\r\nand made a slight advance. On the 20th it was relieved.\r\n\r\n3. The division marched by Savigny-Trigny-Bourgogne-Houdicourt. It was\r\nrailed to Asfeld and rested at Sery. On the 27th it marched to Novion-\r\nPorcien and was railed to Montmedy. From there it marched to Grand\r\nFailly, where it camped until the 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. On August 8 the division relieved the 6th Bavarian Division near\r\nSamogneux and rested in that sector until September 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n5. After it rested in the St. Mihiel sector until September 12, it was\r\nput into line at Thiaucourt to check the American offensive. It remained\r\nthere until the night of October 7–8, when it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n6. The division was moved by autotrucks to Dun via Spincourt-Billy-\r\nDamvillers-Haraumont-Fontaines, arriving there on the night of October\r\n9–10. It marched into line near Cunel on October 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. The division was engaged in almost continuous fighting without any\r\nmajor attack, until it was withdrawn on October 25. While it did not win\r\nspecial merit for its defense, it fought persistently and was quick to\r\ntake every advantage of the terrain. The division lost 238 prisoners and\r\n2,200 other casualties (estimated). The division was considered in\r\nreserve of the 5th Army at the time of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its conduct in the July offensive\r\nwas mediocre and in the Argonne it did nothing to distinguish itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             183d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │183.          │183.          │183.          │183.\r\n              │              │184.          │              │184.\r\n              │              │122 Res.      │              │122 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │183 F.

It comprised at that time the 183d\r\nInfantry (Saxon) and the 184th Infantry (Prussian), to which there was\r\nadded in July, 1915, the 122d Reserve Regiment (Wurttemberg), three\r\nnewly formed regiments, the 184th being organized out of companies taken\r\nfrom various regiments of the 7th and 8th Divisions. In November, 1916,\r\nthe 183d Division was modified. Two of its original regiments (the 183d\r\nand the 122d Reserve) were respectively replaced by the newly formed\r\n418th and 440th Reserve—the 418th Regiment being formed from companies\r\nof the 111th Division, the Ersatz Division of the Guard, the 8th, Ersatz\r\nDivision, and the 10th Ersatz Division, and the 440th Reserve Regiment\r\nbeing organized out of various elements, including the 3d Battalion of\r\nthe 79th Reserve Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 75th Landwehr.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1915, the 183d Brigade occupied the Missy sur Aisne sector\r\n(east of Soissons).\r\n\r\n2. At the end of June it was engaged at Quennevieres.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to Lorraine (end of July), it stayed there until the end\r\nof September (region of Benestroff).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. It was brought to the Champagne front (between Prunay and Souain)\r\nabout September 23 and opposed the French offensive (September-October).\r\nThe 184th Infantry was nearly wiped out on September 25, the 183d losing\r\na very large number of prisoners.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from the front in November, the brigade was put at rest in\r\nthe vicinity of Charleroi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1916, the division was in reserve in the vicinity of\r\nMachault.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. From February to May it was on the Champagne front near the Souain-\r\nSomme Py road.\r\n\r\n3. June; at rest (region of Tournai). At the end of June the 183d\r\nBrigade became the 183d Division by changing the 183d Field Artillery\r\nDetatchment into a regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On July 2 it was brought to the north of the Somme and engaged in the\r\nvicinity of Pozières-Contalmaison until July 24. It suffered very heavy\r\nlosses here—from the 10th to the 15th the 184th Infantry lost about\r\n2,000 men.\r\n\r\n5. About July 25 it was withdrawn from the front and reorganized. (It\r\nreceived 2,000 replacements, mostly men from the 1916 and 1917 classes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. From the end of July to September 21: Neuville-St. Vaast sector\r\n(north of Arras).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n7. From the beginning of October to the 21st it went into its second\r\nengagement on the Somme (Belloy-Deniécourt sector) and was again sorely\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n8. November 15 to February, 1917, Côtes de Meuse (Lamorville-Spada\r\nsector.) In November the 183d Division was reorganized and became\r\nentirely Prussian (present composition)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. From the middle of February to the beginning of April, 1917, it was\r\nat rest in the region of Conflans, then in the vicinity of Anizy le\r\nChâteau.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of April the 183d Division came to strengthen the\r\nChavonne-Soupir-Braye en Laonnois sector. While opposing the French\r\nattack of April 16 it suffered very heavy losses (2,100 prisoners), and\r\nwhile fighting fell back to the Chemin des Dames (April 18–21). As a\r\nresult of the losses on the 16th the companies of the 184th Regiment\r\nwere reduced to 25 to 30 men.\r\n\r\n3. The division was relieved on April 21. In May the 184th Regiment\r\nreceived 1,500 replacements from the 4th Corps District, half of which\r\nbelong to the class of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n4. From May 11 to June 24 it held the Aspach-Rhone to Rhine Canal\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n5. From the end of June to July 31 it was at rest, successively to the\r\nsouth of Colmar (15 days), near Friberg, and to the south of Longuyon\r\n(Pierrepont).\r\n\r\n6. It entrained at Longuyon for Belgium (July 31) and detrained at\r\nRoulers the 1st and 2d of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n7. On August 15 the division was engaged near St. Julien (southwest of\r\nPoelcappelle) until August 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n8. After a short rest in the region of Cambrai it took over the\r\nVendhuile-Hargicourt sector, to the west of Catelet, on September 9. On\r\nNovember 20 part of the 440th Reserve Regiment was sent as a\r\nreenforcement to the south of Cambrai (Masnières); later the entire 183d\r\nDivision was transferred to the northeast of Vendhuile to cover the\r\nflank of the German attack executed on November 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 183d was more homogeneous than it seemed at first glance. The\r\nrecruits of the 9th and 10th Corps District were often mixed and the\r\n418th and 440th Regiments have many men from the same Provinces. Also\r\nthe 184th received in the main men from that portion of the 4th Corps\r\nDistrict which adjoined the 10th Corps District (Harz section).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the French attack of April 16, 1917, the division as a whole\r\nshowed up well. The 418th and the 440th Reserve gave proof of vigor and\r\ncourage and only gave way under continual pressure of the opposing\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the German Command wished to reward the division for this\r\nresistance by giving Gen. von Schuessler, commanding the 183d Division,\r\nthe Ordre pour le Mérite.\r\n\r\nThe 183d Division was sorely tried in the course of these attacks and\r\nhad to be entirely reorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Vendhulle sector until February 2, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 79th Reserve Division. It returned to this part of the\r\nline on February 25, relieving the 79th Reserve Division. It took part\r\nin the attack of March 21, advancing by Epehy (21st), Manancourt (23d),\r\nto Bazentin (25th). It retired to rest at Contalmaison.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n2. The division received drafts in early April. On the 16th it came into\r\nline north of Albert and held there for four weeks. On the 13th of May\r\nit was relieved by the 243d Division.\r\n\r\n3. On the 19th the division was engaged at Ville sur Ancre, but after\r\nfour days in line it was relieved and sent to a quiet sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n4. On June 22 the division took over the Regnieville sector, which it\r\nheld until July 14 without event. It was relieved by the 77th Reserve\r\nDivision on that date.\r\n\r\n5. It entrained at Thiaucourt on July 16 and traveled via Montmedy-\r\nSedan-Charleville-Charleroi-Mons-Valenciennes and detrained near Cambrai\r\non the night of July 17–18. From there it marched to Ypres, rested there\r\nfor six days, and on the 25th relieved the 26th Reserve Division in the\r\nHebuterne sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n6. The division was struck by the British offensive in August, and\r\nbefore it was withdrawn near Irles on August 24 it had suffered heavy\r\ncasualties, including the loss of 1,400 prisoners.\r\n\r\n7. It marched to Cambrai, where it remained three days. On the 28th it\r\nwas marched to Douai and entrained for Lille, from where it marched to\r\nTemplemars. On the night of September 3–4 it relieved the 18th Reserve\r\nDivision north of the La Bassee Canal.\r\n\r\n8. The division was engaged in the La Bassee sector until September 10.\r\nImmediately after it was withdrawn from line the division was dissolved.\r\nThe 440th Reserve Regiment was sent as a draft to the 11th Division. The\r\nother two regiments of the division were also disbanded and used as\r\ndrafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as an assault\r\ndivision in the March offensive but thereafter deteriorated. It was next\r\nseriously employed on the Somme in August, where its tremendous losses\r\nrobbed it of further utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            185th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │185.          │185.          │185.          │185.\r\n              │              │186.          │              │186.\r\n              │              │190.          │              │190.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │\r\n              │                             │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │185 F.

Merely a brigade (the 185th) at\r\nthe outset, it was composed of the 185th Infantry (from various Baden\r\nregiments), of the 186th Regiment (Hessian elements), and of the 190th\r\nRegiment (Westphalian elements). Later the 185th Brigade underwent\r\nchanges which entirely changed its original composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHÉBUTERNE.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1915, the 185th and 186th Infantry Regiments were engaged in\r\nthe vicinity of Hébuterne.\r\n\r\n2. The three regiments of the 185th Brigade entrained at Douai at the\r\nend of July and were transferred to Alsace.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n3. At first it was in reserve in the region of Mulhouse; later it was\r\nput in line between Altkirch and the Swiss frontier, where it stayed\r\nuntil the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of October it was in Champagne holding the sector\r\nwest of the Souain-Somme Py road.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n1. The 185th Brigade stayed on the Champagne front (Tahure) until the\r\nmiddle of June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July it opposed the Franco-British offensive in\r\nthe Somme at the northeast of Fricourt, near Thiepval, Contalmaison, and\r\nBazentin (beginning of July to the 18th). It suffered serious losses.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of July it rested at St. Quentin, Vermand and Cateau. At\r\nthis time the 185th Brigade became the 185th Division by the\r\ntransformation of its field artillery detachment into a regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE-AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. In August it held a sector to the west of Soissons (from the Oise to\r\nChevillecourt). The 185th Division was reorganized by the transfer of\r\nits three infantry regiments which were replaced by the 65th and the\r\n161st Infantry from the 15th Division and by the 28th Reserve Regiment\r\nfrom the 16th Reserve Division—both Rhenish divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n5. The 185th, thus reorganized, was brought back to the Somme about\r\nSeptember 7. It was engaged near Ginchy and Combles until the middle of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n6. After a short stay north of Soissons (end of October to the beginning\r\nof November) it came back for a third time in the Somme district\r\n(Saillisel, night of Nov. 10–11). Here it was again put to a test.\r\n\r\n7. It left the Somme on December 9 and rested in Belgium (Alost).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January elements of the division were in line to\r\nthe south of Grenier wood (region of Lille).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. The division occupied a sector north of Ypres (Wieltje) from the\r\nbeginning of February to April 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. About April 20 it was engaged in front of Arras (to the north of the\r\nScarpe until the beginning of May). Losses sustained obliged it to have\r\nrecourse to a distant source for replacements: the Ersatz Truppe of\r\nWarsaw (class of 1918 and men put back of the 1917 class), which\r\nreenforcements arrived at top speed on May 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n4. The division held the La Basée sector (Hulluch-Vermelles) from the\r\nend of May to September 21.\r\n\r\n5. In October it was at rest for three weeks in the vicinity of Carvin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS-CAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. Transferred to Belgium (Oct. 28) it took over a sector to the west of\r\nHouthulst Forest (Nov. 6–7). In December it was on the Cambrai front\r\n(until about Jan. 10, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nSince August, 1916, the division had been entirely composed of regiments\r\ncoming from the Rhine Province (8th Corps District) and as such is\r\nentirely homogeneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 185th Division gave good account of itself in all the battles in\r\nwhich it took part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 185th Division was withdrawn from the Cambrai front near\r\nGonnelieu, being relieved by the 9th Reserve Division during the night\r\nof January 11–12. It went to the Solesmes area, where it was trained\r\nwith a view of being used in offensive operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n2. About the middle of February it relieved the 24th Division near\r\nMonchy le Preux (southeast of Arras). On the 28th of March it attacked\r\nwith all three regiments, and suffered heavy losses from enfilade\r\nmachine-gun fire; officer casualties for the division amounted to 90. It\r\nwas withdrawn about the 27th of April.\r\n\r\n3. It relieved the 26th Reserve Division near Mercatel (southeast of\r\nArras) between the 13th and 16th of May. It was relieved by the 39th\r\nDivision during the night of August 2–3.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n4. On the 18th it reenforced the front near Herleville (south of Bray).\r\nIt was withdrawn on September 5.\r\n\r\n5. On the 18th it reenforced the front near Villeret (northwest of St.\r\nQuentin), and was withdrawn on the 1st of October. During these last two\r\nengagements the division lost heavily, more than 2,050 in prisoners\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n6. A week later it reenforced the front near Ligny en Cambresis (west of\r\nLe Cateau).

Its regiments were made up as follows: The 187th, from the 9th\r\nCorps District; the 188th, from the 4th Corps District; and the 189th, a\r\nBrandenburger unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. In June, 1915, the 187th Brigade was sent to Alsace and stayed in\r\nline in the Fecht valley and the vicinity (Metzeral-Sondernach-\r\nHilsenfirst-Reichackerkopf) until the end of December.\r\n\r\n2. It next went to rest in the vicinity of Colmar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1916, it went back in line in the Fecht valley\r\nand the region of Guebwiller. It was kept there until the summer,\r\nparticipating in battles for the possession of the heights\r\n(Hartmannswillerkopf, Reichackerkopf).\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of July the 187th Brigade became the 187th Division\r\nby the transformation of its field artillery detachment into a regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the end of August from the Muenster, it rested eight days\r\nat Rouffach then entrained at Colmar for the Roumanian front.\r\n(Itinerary: Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Ulm-Munich-Vienna-Budapest-Sieben-\r\nBuergen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n4. On September 13 it was engaged in Transylvania (region of\r\nHermannstadt, Tour Rouge passes), then took part in the battle of Brasso\r\n(Kronstadt) at the beginning of October and in the operations in the\r\nvicinity of Slanic (December). It suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA-FRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. On February 11, 1917, the 187th Division left Roumania for the\r\nWestern Front. (Itinerary: Arad-Budapest-Oppeln-Breslau-Dresden-\r\nWuerzberg-Strassberg.) It was at rest near Dieuze (about six weeks).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. About April 20 it took over the Moncel-Arracourt sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. Hastily relieved on April 28, it entrained at Morhange on May 2 and\r\ndetrained in the vicinity of Amagne and was put into line on May 10 on\r\nthe Rheims front (north of Bermericourt; southeast of Berry au Bac)\r\nuntil June 15.\r\n\r\n4. At rest in the Aussonce-La Neuville area (end of June to July) the\r\n187th Division was held in reserve as a “Stossdivision” or\r\n“Eingriffsdivision.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. About July 14 it was engaged in the Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut\r\nsector, which it held until August 26. The 187th Infantry was\r\nparticularly tried during the attack of July 26.\r\n\r\n6. From August 26 to September 29 it was at rest in camps at La Neuville\r\nen Tourne à Fuii later in the region of Vervins.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n7. Transferred to Belgium (Sept. 30), the division opposed the British\r\nattack near Poelcappelle. It was partially relieved after the attack and\r\nwent into line and counter attacked on the 10th to the north of\r\nLangemarck. Its losses in this sector were heavy.\r\n\r\n8. After a rest to the north of Bruges from the 12th of October to\r\nNovember, it went back to the front near Blankaart (south of Dixmude).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe three regiments of this division came from different Provinces—the\r\n187th from Schleswig-Holstein, the 188th from Prussian-Saxony, and the\r\n189th from Brandenburg. This was confirmed by a German communiqué which\r\nmentioned “the attack troops from Schleswig-Holstein and Brandenberg” at\r\nMont Haut (July, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 187th Division was made up of young men who were well trained and\r\nwho came from active divisions.\r\n\r\nThe 187th Division was a division equipped for mountain warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENTIERES.\r\n\r\n1. The 187th Division was withdrawn from line south of Lake Blankaart\r\nabout the 10th of January, and on the 16th relieved the 38th Landwehr\r\nDivision near Bois Grenier (south of Armentieres). It was relieved by\r\nthe 6th Bavarian Division about February 20 and went to the Lille area,\r\nwhere it most probably received training in open warfare, though the\r\nfact has not been definitely established.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n2. It left there and arrived at Douai on the 25th of March. It spent the\r\nnight of the 27th–28th in Vitry. On the 28th it reenforced the front\r\nnear Fampoux (east of Arras) on the 28th, when it attacked. A man of the\r\n188th Regiment subsequently wrote: “We tried to break through on the\r\n28/3/18, but only pushed Tommy back to his reserve line, and don’t\r\nforget that it was with enormous losses to ourselves.” It was relieved\r\nby the 2d Guard Reserve Division during the night of May 18–19, and went\r\nto rest in the region east of Douai.\r\n\r\n3. During the night of June 18–19 it came back and relieved the 2d Guard\r\nReserve Division. It was relieved by the 48th Reserve Division on the\r\n7th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENTIERES.\r\n\r\n4. After less than a week’s rest, the division came to the Armentieres\r\nfront and relieved the 39th Division between Neuf-Berquin and Vieux-\r\nBerquin (north of Merville). It was relieved early in September by the\r\nextension of fronts of the neighboring divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n5. On the 7th it reenforced the front in the Inchy en Artois sector\r\n(west of Cambrai). After suffering exceedingly heavy losses, it was\r\nwithdrawn about the 28th and went to rest in the Boushain region.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUAI.\r\n\r\n6. October 3 it relieved the 15th Reserve Division in the Oppy sector\r\n(west of Douai), and was withdrawn about the 20th.\r\n\r\n7. On the 27th it reenforced the front in the Chateau l’Abbaye sector\r\n(northeast of St. Amand), but was withdrawn a few days later.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIENNES.\r\n\r\n9. It was identified in line near Quievrechain (northeast of\r\nValenciennes) on November 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 187th was rated as a second-class division. The only offensive in\r\nwhich it participated was that of the Somme, where it did not\r\ndistinguish itself. Subsequently it was used only to hold the front.\r\nToward the end of the year it was very much reduced in strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             192d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1915             │            1916\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │192.          │192.          │192.          │192.\r\n              │              │193.          │              │193.\r\n              │              │25 Bav.       │              │25 Bav.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │1 Ldw.

It was\r\nformed at the beginning of June, 1915, with the 192d Infantry (Saxon),\r\nformed out of elements taken from the 32d Division, the 193d\r\n(Westphalian, 7th Corps District), detached after its creation to the\r\n13th Reserve Division, and with the 25th Bavarian Regiment, formerly\r\nbelonging to the 4th Bavarian Division, the regiments of which had\r\ncontributed to the formation of this last regiment.\r\n\r\n1. Until the month of September, 1915, the three regiments of the\r\nbrigade occupied different sectors on the Western Front—the 192d near\r\nCharency in August, the 193d on the Aisne (region of Chamouille), and\r\nthe 25th Bavarian near Warneton (Flanders) in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September the elements of the 192d Brigade were brought\r\ntogether in the rear of the Champagne front. Engaged as a reenforcement\r\nagainst the French offensive (Sept. 27 to the beginning of October) near\r\nthe Souain-Somme Py road, it suffered heavy losses (50 officers and\r\n3,594 men out of action, according to official lists). The brigade\r\nstayed in the Souain sector until the end of November.\r\n\r\n3. In December it was at rest in the region of Bignicourt-Machault.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of January, 1916, the 192d Brigade again took a\r\nsector in Champagne (until Jan. 26).\r\n\r\n2. From the end of January to the beginning of March it was at rest in\r\nthe vicinity of Montcornet.\r\n\r\n3. From the 4th to the 18th of March the regiments were engaged in\r\nmaking defensive works in the region of Laon.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN-BOIS D’AVOCOURT.\r\n\r\n4. On March 18 the brigade was brought near Vouziers and Stenay, then\r\nassembled in the rear of the Verdun front on the left bank of the Meuse\r\n(Mar. 22). On the 23d it relieved the 11th Bavarian Division, sorely\r\ntried by the attacks on Malancourt and the Bois d’Avocourt. It took part\r\nitself in the battles which effected the capture of that wood and\r\nsuffered heavy losses. From April 13 to May 10 the 11th Company of the\r\n192d Infantry received at least 125 replacements and the 12th Company\r\n116 replacements.\r\n\r\n5. The 192d Brigade stayed in the Malancourt-Avocourt wood sector until\r\nthe end of August, holding it alternately with the 11th Bavarian\r\nDivision. During this period (May-August) it only took part in local\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\n6. In June it was changed into a division, its composition remaining\r\nunchanged except for the expansion of its field artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEURY-DOUAUMONT.\r\n\r\n7. On August 22 the new division was relieved and transferred to the\r\nright bank of the Meuse (Charency-Longuyon). On the 28th it was engaged\r\nin the Fleury-Douaumont sector. Its regiments were sorely tried by the\r\nFrench attacks of September 3 and 9.\r\n\r\n8. Relieved from the front at the end of September and beginning of\r\nOctober the division was entirely reorganized. The 193d Infantry went to\r\nthe 222d Division (being organized) and was replaced by the 418th, newly\r\nformed; the 25th Bavarian went to the 14th Bavarian Division and was\r\nreplaced by the 245th Reserve Regiment of the 54th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n9. About the end of October the 418th Regiment, which had been put in\r\nline in the Moranville sector (Côtes de Meuse), replaced the 183d\r\nInfantry in the 183d Division, the last-named regiment going to the 192d\r\nDivision, which was now entirely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEZONVAUX.\r\n\r\nThe 192d Division, having thus acquired its present organization, took a\r\nposition to the east of Bezonvaux in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN-BEZONVAUX.\r\n\r\n1. It occupied this sector until December, 1917, and during this long\r\nperiod remained entirely passive.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILL 344.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved from this calm sector about December 10, 1917, it\r\nimmediately went into line north of Hill 344, where it still was in\r\nJanuary, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was entirely Saxon after the end of 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 192d Division stayed more than a year in a very calm sector (east of\r\nBezonvaux, December 1916, to December, 1917).\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, the division might be considered as rested, but its\r\ncombat value at that time seemed rather mediocre. In the various actions\r\nin which it took part on the Verdun front it did not distinguish itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector on the Verdun front until the middle of\r\nApril, when it was relieved, and on May 19 it relieved the 200th\r\nDivision southeast of Rouvrel. It was still in line when the Allies\r\nattacked on August 8. About August 11 the division was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n2. The division marched to Origny via Rosieres-Athies-St. Quentin. It\r\nleft there August 25 and went by train to Chambley via Ribemont-Crecy-\r\nMortiers-Marle-Charleville-Sedan-Montmedy-Longuyon-Metz, arriving on\r\nAugust 26. On the 20th the division entered line in the tip of the St.\r\nMihiel salient.\r\n\r\n3. The division extracted itself from the salient and was relieved about\r\nSeptember 22, when the line had stabilized. It was moved west and again\r\ncame into line at Bezonvaux.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n4. From October 8 until about October 22 the division held the Bezonvaux\r\nsector. It was then shifted northward to the area south of Etrayes,\r\nwhere it remained until the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It did well at St. Mihiel, but in\r\nits other sectors its conduct was mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            195th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │101 Res. │6 Jag.   │101 Res. │6 Jag.   │101 Res. │6 Jag.\r\n              │         │8 Jag.   │         │8 Jag.   │         │8 Jag.\r\n              │         │233 Res. │         │233 Res. │         │14 Jag.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │(3 Sqn. 14 Uhlan   │2 Sqn. 14 Uhlan\r\n              │                   │  Rgt.)            │  Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │260 F.

The division was organized in July, 1916, in the Ruddervoorde region\r\nwith the following elements: (1) 233d Reserve Regiment, obtained from\r\nthe 51st Reserve Division; (2) the 6th Jägers (5th and 6th Battalions of\r\nJägers, 14th Battalion of Jägers—the last after arriving on the Russian\r\nfront was thereafter replaced by the 2d Reserve Battalion of Jägers);\r\n(3) 8th Jägers (4th, 16th, and 24th Battalions of Reserve Jägers).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. It was shortly thereafter transferred to Galicia.\r\n\r\n3. The division took part in the open warfare of August, 1916.\r\n\r\n4. It next went into line with Austrian troops in the Zloczow sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. It was transferred to the Western Front at the end of April, 1917.\r\n(Itinerary: Leniky-Cracovie-Oppeln-Breslau-Leipzig-Halle-Paderborn-\r\nEssen-Duesseldorf-Aix la Chapelle-Verviers-Liége-Louvain-Brussels-\r\nCambrai.)\r\n\r\n2. The division was successively in line in the Ypres sector (May), in\r\nthe Wytschaete sector (June-July), and in the St. Quentin sector\r\n(August).\r\n\r\n3. During the month of August it rested in the Walincourt region.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. From October 3 to 12 it fought in the Passchendaele sector. It\r\nsustained heavy losses (more than 600 prisoners).\r\n\r\n5. Relieved on October 12 the division was reorganized at Meulebecke\r\nfrom the 14th to the 18th and was transferred by rail to Gand. At the\r\ntime it was relieved the 233d Reserve was reduced to 800 men (story of\r\ndeserter).\r\n\r\n6. On about the 21st it entrained at Heydinge and was brought via\r\nBrussels-Namur-Dinant-Givet-Charleville-Sedan-Montmedy and Conflans to\r\nHaye, where it detrained on the 23d.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n7. On October 28 it took over a sector to the southwest of Thiaucourt\r\n(Flirey).\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n8. On November 11 the division was entrained at Metz for Italy. It\r\ndetrained at Trente on November 14, where it rested until the 24th. It\r\nleft Trente on December 3 without having participated in any engagement.\r\n(Itinerary: Trente-Innsbruck-Munich-Carlsruhe-Offenberg-Friberg-\r\nMulhouse.)\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n9. Arriving on December 6, it was billeted in the region of Sundgau,\r\nwhere it stayed until February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was very heterogeneous. The 233d came from Thuringen (11th\r\nCorps District). The various jaeger regiments came from various depot\r\njaeger battalions (2d, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 11th Corps Districts).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 195th Division was sorely tried in Flanders in October, 1917. In\r\nNovember, 1917, the greater part of its strength came from the classes\r\ncalled during the war. The average age was 25. It can be classed as a\r\ngood division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n1. The 195th Division left Alsace, where it had been resting since its\r\nreturn from Italy, the 5th and 6th of February, and proceeded to\r\nValenciennes. On the 27th a prisoner was captured near Bullecourt\r\n(northeast of Bapaume), who stated that his battalion had relieved\r\nanother battalion of the same regiment during the night of the\r\n25th–26th. The 195th Division had probably relieved the 16th Bavarian\r\nDivision some days before. It was relieved by the 16th Bavarian Division\r\non the 2d of March. It was very probably trained in open warfare, but\r\nthe fact has not been definitely established.\r\n\r\n2. On the 21st it came back reenforcing the front near Noreuil\r\n(northeast of Bapaume). The heavy fighting on this front did not come in\r\nthe first days of the offensive but a few days later the division was\r\nheavily engaged, especially on the 28th and 31st near Bucquoy. This\r\nrepresented an advance of only a few kilometers gained at the cost of\r\nheavy losses in many attacks. It was relieved by the 17th Division\r\nduring the night of April 1–2.\r\n\r\n3. On the 9th it relieved the 16th Bavarian Division in the Ayette\r\nsector (northwest of Bapaume). It remained here fighting hard until\r\nrelieved by the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division about the 24th. In this\r\nfighting the losses were very heavy, especially in the 233d Reserve\r\nRegiment (the commander of which was awarded Pour le Merite) which was\r\ndissolved soon after; its place was taken by the 14th Jaeger Regiment.\r\nIt was sent to the Cambrai region to rest and refit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n4. The first day of the battle of the Marne-July 15—it reenforced the\r\nfront near Chatillon sur Marne (northwest of Epernay). It was withdrawn\r\nearly in August and went to rest near Metz.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n5. On the 14th of September, after the line reached by the American\r\nFirst Army had stabilized, the division entered line in the Haumont\r\nsector (northeast of St. Mihiel). It was not heavily engaged and was\r\nwithdrawn about the 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n6. The division then moved to the Champagne front, where it reenforced\r\nthe front in the St. Etienne à Arnes sector (south of Machault) on the\r\n6th of October. It was opposed by French troops until the 24th; after\r\nthat it was opposite the Americans on account of a readjustment of\r\nsectors. It was withdrawn on the 29th.\r\n\r\n7. On the 2d of November it was thrown back into line near Verrieres\r\n(northwest of Buzancy). Its losses were so heavy in this fighting, and\r\nthe division was in such a state of exhaustion, that although the\r\ndivision was still in line on the 11th there were rumors that it was\r\nsoon to be dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 195th was rated a second-class division. Its conduct whenever\r\nheavily engaged was such as to lead to the conclusion that it was one of\r\nthe better divisions of that class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            197th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[31]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │210.     │273 Res. │210.     │273 Res. │210.     │273 Res.\r\n              │         │7 Jag.   │         │7 Jag.   │         │7 Jag.\r\n              │         │  (Saxon).│         │         │         │  (Saxon).\r\n              │         │32 Ldw.  │         │32 Ldw.  │         │28 Ers.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Sqn. 14 Uhlan    │2 Sqn. 14 Uhlan    │2 Sqn. 14 Uhlan\r\n              │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │261 F.

(2) 7th Jaegers (13th\r\nBattalion of Jaegers), 25th and 26th Battalions of Reserve Jaegers, all\r\nSaxon, and also all coming from France. (3) The 32d Landwehr, which had\r\nbeen under orders of the 33d Division in the Argonne.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. As part of the 2d Austrian Army (Boehm-Ermoli), the 197th Division\r\noccupied in August 1916 the Zborow sector (northwest of Tarnopol) where\r\nit met the offensive carried on by Broussilov. On August 10 the 7th\r\nRegiment of Jaegers had 35 officers and 1,039 men out of action\r\n(letter).\r\n\r\n2. In September it was in line to the northeast of Zalosce and to the\r\nnorth of Zborow and later in the vicinity of Zloczow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. The 197th Division stayed in this same Zloczow sector until July,\r\n1917. While there it met the Russian attack of July 1, which reduced the\r\nstrength of the 1st Battalion of the 32d Landwehr to 160 men (letter).\r\n\r\n2. The division participated in the German counteroffensive of July 19\r\nand advanced by way of Zborow up to Husjatin (August), where it was\r\nrelieved to go into reserve.\r\n\r\n3. It went back into line at the beginning of September at Hlesczawa\r\n(region of Trembowla).\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of November the 32d Landwehr was replaced by the\r\n28th Ersatz, taken from the Bavarian Ersatz Division, and originally\r\nfrom the 14th Corps District (Grand Duchy of Baden). This replacement of\r\na mediocre regiment for a good one was the prelude of preparations for a\r\ntransfer to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThis division had a composite make-up. The 7th Jaegers was Saxon; the\r\n28th Ersatz was from Baden; and the 273d was formed from battalions\r\ncoming from the 7th, 9th, and 10th Corps District and got its\r\nreplacements in theory from the 10th Corps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 197th Division, coming from Galicia, appeared for the first time on\r\nthe Western Front in March, 1918. All the maneuvers executed in the rear\r\nand at rest in Galicia tended to accustom the units to defensive warfare\r\nmethods (Verteidigungskrieg). (Interrogation of a prisoner of the 273d\r\nReserve on Mar. 13, 1918.)\r\n\r\nThis was also true of its stay in the Marchais region (February 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATEAU THIERRY.\r\n\r\nThe division held the quiet Chemin des Dames sector until the Aisne\r\noffensive of May 27. Attack divisions passed through the 197th Division,\r\nwhich followed up the attack in close reserve and was engaged on May 31\r\nnorthwest of Chateau Thierry. It came in for some heavy local fighting\r\nwhile opposite the 2d United States Division near Veuilly before it was\r\nrelieved on June 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n2. It was moved to Eastern Champagne, and on June 23 relieved the 15th\r\nBavarian Division in the Ornes sector. During July the division received\r\ndrafts. It held this sector without loss until about the 1st of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN-OISE.\r\n\r\n3. On August 15 the division reenforced the front at Ribecourt. Until\r\nSeptember 10 it was constantly engaged in the Noyon fighting. After\r\nresting nine days the division returned to line north of Gricourt, and\r\nuntil October 19 resisted every foot of the way to Seboncourt.\r\n\r\n4. After the withdrawal from line the division was broken up. The 273d\r\nReserve Regiment and the 28th Ersatz Regiment were disbanded, while the\r\n7th Jaeger Regiment passed intact to the 241st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. It was heavily engaged on an\r\nactive front for two months in 1918 during which fighting it suffered so\r\nheavily in casualties and morale that it was dissolved in late October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            199th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │237 Res. │59 Ldw.  │114.     │59 Ldw.  │114.\r\n              │         │4 Bav.   │         │357.     │         │357.\r\n              │         │  Res.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │9 Jag.   │         │237 Res. │         │237 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Sqn. 14 Uhlan    │1 Sqn. 14 Uhlan    │1 Sqn. 14 Uhlan\r\n              │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │263 F.

Until the\r\nbeginning of 1917 its infantry was made up as follows: The 237th Reserve\r\nRegiment (coming from the 52d Reserve Division), the 4th Bavarian\r\nReserve Regiment (from the Bavarian Ersatz Division), and the 9th\r\nJaegers (12th and 13th Battalions of Reserve Jaegers (Saxon) and the 8th\r\nBattalion of Jaegers).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. From the end of August to the beginning of November the 199th\r\nDivision was engaged in Galicia (Brzezany, Halicz, Zlota-Lipa) and\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n2. About November 1 the division was transferred to the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary: Lemberg-Cracaw-Breslau-Dresden-Leipzig-Coblenz-Treves-\r\nSedan.) It detrained at Dun and was billeted for three weeks in the\r\nvicinity of Spincourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. Sent to the Champagne district at the end of November and then in the\r\nBohain region, it went into line in the Rancourt-Saillizel sector (end\r\nof December).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1917 the 114th and 357th replaced the 4th Reserve\r\nand the 9th Jaegers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. The 199th Division stayed on the Rancourt front until March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n3. On March 27 it was identified to the east of Longavesnes; then at\r\nVillers-Faucon, Lempire, in the new German positions (April).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved about April 20, it was engaged to the southeast of Arras\r\n(Wancourt-Vis en Artois-Cherisy) and suffered heavy losses (April 27,\r\nMay 3).\r\n\r\n5. Coming back to the west of Catelet (Hargicourt-Bony) about the middle\r\nof May, it left this line on June 8 to go to rest in the vicinity of\r\nOstend.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIAN FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. In the middle of July it took over the Nieuport-Lombartzyde sector,\r\nwhich it occupied until the beginning of August and was at rest near\r\nOstend from August 10 to the middle of September.\r\n\r\n7. It reappeared in the Lombartzyde sector until October 24. On November\r\n10 after a short rest it was put in line to the north of Passchendaele,\r\nwhere it was found, with the exception of some brief withdrawals for\r\nrest, until February, 1918, when it went to rest near Courtrai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nDivision with composite elements; a regiment from Baden (the 114th,\r\nactive), a regiment from Pomerania (the 357th, growing out of brigade\r\nErsatz Battalions), and a Rhenish regiment (the 237th).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 114th was considered the best in the division. The 237th Reserve did\r\nnot seem to have a very good combat value. It did not hold its ground\r\nwhen opposed by the British at Cherisy (April, 1917). It is said that a\r\ncompany of this regiment refused to come out of the trenches in the\r\nmonth of July, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division left Flanders at the end of February and trained in the\r\nLe Quesnoy area until the middle of March; left on the 17th for the\r\nbattle front. It marched to Escaromain, and on the 18th to Quievy. On\r\nthe day before the offensive the division marched via Caudry to Villers\r\nOutreaux. It was not identified in the fight until the 25th at\r\nHardecourt. The next day it was at Maricourt wood, after which it\r\nappears to have been withdrawn. On April 4 it relieved the 243d Division\r\nsouth of Thennes.\r\n\r\n2. After its relief the division marched by stages via Beaucourt en\r\nSanterre-Vauvillers-Peronne to Templeux, la Fosse, where it rested for a\r\nfortnight. The heavy losses incurred by the division during its last\r\ntime in line south of the Somme were made good chiefly by drafts of the\r\n1919 class from the depots at Warsaw and Bruges. The division contained\r\na large proportion of this class and its fighting quality suffered in\r\nconsequence. On the 26th of April the division moved to Maurepas and\r\nproceeded to Maricourt on the 28th; from there it marched into line in\r\nthe Morlancourt sector.\r\n\r\n3. The division held the Morlancourt sector from about May 1 to 16. It\r\nwas relieved by the 107th Division and rested in the Valenciennes area\r\nin June.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. It was engaged at Le Teton on July 15 and held a sector in that area\r\nuntil the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n5. On August 3 it reenforced the battle front at Sapicourt west of\r\nRheims. It was engaged in that area except for a week’s rest until the\r\nend of September.\r\n\r\n6. After October 1 the division was engaged in Champagne in the region\r\nof Orfeuil. It contested hotly the advance through Vaudy and Vouziers\r\nuntil its relief in late October. It rested but a few days out of line\r\nand after November 3 was engaged at St. Lambert, Roix-Terron, and Dom le\r\nMesnil (Nov. 10).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second-class. It was used as an attack\r\ndivision in March and did well. Thereafter it saw almost constant\r\nservice in resisting allied pushes. In October’s fighting it was\r\nfrequently spoken of by the German official communique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            200th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │2 Jag.   │3 Jag.

The 200th Division, composed of three regiments of Jaegers, was\r\nformed in July, 1916, in Galicia with the 3rd Jaeger Regiment (4\r\nbattalions equipped with skis) coming from the Alpine Corps, with the\r\n4th Jaegers (11th Battalion of Jaegers), 5th and 6th Battalions of\r\nReserve Jaegers, and with the 5th Jaegers (17th, 18th, and 23d\r\nBattalions of Reserve Jaegers).\r\n\r\n\r\nBUKOVINA.\r\n\r\nThe 200th Division, together with the 1st Division, formed the\r\nCarpathian Corps. The division took part in the counteroffensive in the\r\nCarpathians against the Russians and beginning in September 1, 1916,\r\noccupied a sector to the north of Mont Tomnatik (Bukovina.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUKOVINA.\r\n\r\n1. The 200th Division stayed in the same part of the Carpathians (south\r\nof Mt. Pnevié-Mt. Tomnatik) until July, 1917. At this time it took part\r\nin the offensive waged in Bukovina and took a position north of the\r\nSereth. It was kept here until September.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of September the 200th Division was entrained for Italy.\r\nIts itinerary to Vienna was Kolomea-Lemberg-Cracaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n3. Detraining in the vicinity of Laibach, it went toward the Italian\r\nfrontier, where it took about 15 days’ rest. On October 22 it drew near\r\nthe Italian frontier and on the 24th was engaged in the offensive on the\r\nIsonzo and advanced by way of Cividale and Udine, where it fought the\r\nItalian rear guards (Oct. 28–30). It reached Codroipo about November 3\r\nand Quero on the Piave the 23d.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONT TOMBA.\r\n\r\n4. After a short period of rest it was again sent to the Mont Tomba\r\nregion in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 200th Division had recruits from the various mountainous districts\r\nof the empire—Upper Silesia, Harz, Black Forest, etc.—which gave it a\r\ncertain character in spite of the different sources of its recruiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nComposed of young and vigorous men with high morale, the 200th was one\r\nof the best divisions in the German Army (1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n1. After having suffered heavy losses, the 200th Division was withdrawn\r\nabout the 1st of January, and went to rest for about a month southeast\r\nof Bellune. Early in February, it entrained at Santa Lucia and traveled\r\nvia Rosenheim-Munich-Ulm-Freiburg-Colmar. It detrained at Bening and\r\nwent to rest and to be trained for about three weeks in the vicinity of\r\nSt. Avold.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. The division entrained near Marsal (southwest of Dieuze) on the 26th\r\nof March and, traveling via Thionville-Luxemburg-Namur, detrained at\r\nCambrai two days later. It rested in the caserne here until the 31st,\r\nwhen it marched to Peronne, where it remained in the English barracks\r\nthe 2d and 3d of April, when it marched via Guillaucourt to Moreuil\r\n(northwest of Montdidier). During the night of the 7th–8th it relieved\r\nthe 14th Division west of Moreuil. It was relieved on May 14 by the 192d\r\nDivision. It was reported near Quesnoy the end of May and in the Le\r\nCateau region early in June. Men of one of its regiments were reported\r\nas having been seen near Fere en Tardenois on the 3d of June. Again,\r\nparts of the division were reported near Caudry and Chateau Thierry\r\nduring June.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 15th of July the division attacked west of Dormans. It crossed\r\nthe Marne at Sailly, and was identified at Chapelle Monthod on the\r\nfollowing day. In this fighting, the division suffered very heavy\r\nlosses. The colonel and all the battalion commanders of the 3rd Jaeger\r\nRegiment were lost. It was withdrawn from line on the 21st.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of the 26th–27th it came back into line near\r\nRoncheres (north of Dormans), its mission being to cover the retreat\r\nbetween Sergy and the Meuniere wood. It was withdrawn about the 3d of\r\nAugust and went to the Sedan area, where it rested for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n5. During the night of the 22d–23d the division relieved the 22d Reserve\r\nDivision northwest of Souain. In the heavy fighting that followed the\r\ndivision lost heavily. It was driven back to St. Etienne à Arnes, where\r\nit was relieved by the 195th Division on the 6th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASSIGNY.\r\n\r\n6. The division then moved by easy stages, with frequent halts, via\r\nRozoy-Montcornet-Origny-Escautpont-Le Nouvion-Beaurepaire-Barzy. During\r\nthe night of October 22–23 it relieved the 5th Reserve Division near\r\nOisy (east of Wassigny). It had not been withdrawn on the 11th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 200th was rated as a second-class division. Composed of Jaeger\r\nunits, which are good fighters, it distinguished itself in the East and\r\nin Italy, and did well in the heavy fighting it was called upon to do on\r\nthe Western Front, though not brilliantly. It was one of the best of the\r\nsecond-class divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            201st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[32]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │401.     │401.     │402.     │401.     │402.     │401.\r\n              │         │402.     │         │402.     │         │402.\r\n              │402.     │403.     │         │403.     │         │403.\r\n              │         │404.     │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │4 Sqn. 4 Mounted   │4 Sqn. 7 Drag.

The Allenstein (401st) Regiment\r\nand the Danzig (402d) Regiment came from the Arys cantonment. The Glogau\r\n(403d) Regiment and the Posen (404th) came from the Warthe cantonment.\r\nMen taken from the front, convalescents from depots and a majority of\r\nyoung men from the class of 1917 made up the initial strength, which was\r\n230 to 240 men per company.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. As soon as formed the division occupied a sector on the Russian front\r\n(north of Baranovitchi) and stayed there from the beginning of July,\r\n1916, to the beginning of December, 1917. During this period it only\r\ntook part in two local actions (November, 1916, and November, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 404th Infantry was taken away from this division in the beginning\r\nof 1917 and was joined to the divisions in the neighborhood (the 18th\r\nLandwehr Division and later the 4th Landwehr Division).\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA-FRANCE.\r\n\r\n2. At the end of November, 1917, the 201st Division was relieved,\r\nreassembled at Baranovitchi, and entrained for the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary: Baranovitchi-Brest-Litowsk-Warsaw-Chemnitz-Nuerenberg-\r\nHeilbronn-Rastatt-Sarreguemines.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3.

It had not been exhausted physically and had in\r\nno way lost its morale. Fraternization did not lessen its morale, but\r\nrather raised it on account of their belief that war could be terminated\r\non the Western Front by an easy victory after peace was concluded with\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nSince its return from Russia its regiments had undergone an intensive\r\ntraining in trench and open warfare (February, 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Apremont sector (southeast of St. Mihiel) until\r\nthe end of May, when it was withdrawn. It rested and trained in the\r\nWoevre (Sponville) until June 9. It entrained at Mars la Tour and moved\r\nto Laon via Sedan and Liart. From there it marched to the Marne front\r\nthrough Vailly-Lannoy-Brecy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n2. It was in line on the Chateau Thierry-Vaux sector from June 15 to the\r\nend of July. In the attacks of late July the division was hit hard. It\r\nwas thrown back on Bezu-St. Germain, Beuvardes, Pere en Tardenois and\r\nrelieved about July 30.\r\n\r\n3. The division was moved to the Argonne in early August and about the\r\n10th entered the Vacquois sector, which it held until the end of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. It returned to the Somme area and on the night of September 6–7\r\nrelieved the 6th Cavalry Division northeast of Fins. Until the 28th it\r\nwas engaged at Fins, Hendicourt, Gouzeaucourt, Villers, and Guislan.\r\nLosses were very heavy, including 2,200 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n5. After a week’s rest, the division reentered line south of Cambrai on\r\nOctober 5 and fought in this region until the 15th. Here it lost another\r\n650 prisoners.\r\n\r\n6. As a result of these extraordinary losses the division was dissolved\r\nat Maubeuge on October 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its losses were unusually heavy\r\nin prisoners whenever it was engaged in an active front. When it was\r\ndissolved its effectives numbered less than 1,000 rifles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             202d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │405.     │406.     │408.     │406.     │97.\r\n              │         │406.     │         │411.     │         │408.\r\n              │         │407.     │         │412.     │         │411.\r\n              │         │408.     │         │         │         │412.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │                   │3 Sqn. 2 Gd.

The 405th and the 406th were\r\norganized at the Lockstedt cantonment, the 407th at the Altengrabow\r\ncantonment, and the 408th comes from Guard depots.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. In the course of October, 1916, the 202d Division was sent to the\r\nRussian front. Its organization was changed; it gave up the 405th to the\r\n203d Division, the 406th and the 407th to the 205th Division. It was at\r\nthis time composed of the 408th and two regiments received from the 203d\r\nDivision, the 411th and the 412th (Hanover), which were formed at the\r\nMunster cantonment as “coast-defense regiments.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n2. In December, 1916, the 202d Division was identified in the region of\r\nRiga.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1.

In the middle of September it was at the east of Riga. It was also\r\nidentified at Riga on October 29.\r\n\r\n3. In November the 202d Division was entrained for the Western Front.\r\n(Itinerary: Riga-Mitau-Insterburg-Koenigsberg-Thorn (408th)-\r\nSchneidemuehl-Posen-Leipzig-Halle-Frankfort on the Main-Sarrebrueck-\r\nSarreguemines.) It detrained at Dieuze on November 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. The division stayed in the rear of the front in the vicinity of\r\nDieuze until the middle of January, 1918 (six weeks’ training).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 408th Regiment was built up out of depots of the Guard and was\r\nrecruited from all sections of Prussia. The 411th and 412th were\r\ntheoretically from Hanover, with some recruits furnished by the 9th\r\nCorps District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

It entrained near Moyenvic on May 19\r\nand traveled via Metz-Spincourt-Longuyon-Sedan-Charleville-Marle to\r\nFlavy le Martel, where it detrained on May 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n2. On the night of May 22–23 it relieved the 11th Division west of\r\nNoyon. It was in line when the attack of June was made and advanced by\r\nOrval as far as Bethencourt. Here it remained in sector until about July\r\n10, when it exchanged sectors with the 105th Division at Autreches. In\r\nthis area it was struck by the Allied attack in mid-August and forced\r\nback on Audignicourt. The losses were very heavy, including 2,000\r\nprisoners. It was relieved on August 27.\r\n\r\n3. The division was railed to the vicinity of Vouziers after its relief\r\nin line. While resting at Sugny (Sept. 2–12) it was re-formed. The 412th\r\nRegiment was dissolved and its effectives distributed between the 408th\r\nand 411th Regiments. The 97th Regiment, from the dissolved 108th\r\nDivision, replaced the 412th Regiment in the division.\r\n\r\n4. It was engaged in Champagne near Maisons de Champagne from September\r\n12 to 24. After that it was in close support of the 42d Division until\r\nthe 27th, when it reentered line at Fontaine les Dormois. Until October\r\n10 the division saw heavy fighting about Meuse and Challerange. It lost\r\nvery heavily, including more than 800 prisoners.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested from October 11 to 21. It was reengaged southeast\r\nof Vouziers (near Falaise) on the 21st, and after the 1st of November\r\nretreated by way of Longwe (2d), Boult aux Bois (34d) to the Meuse\r\n(8th).\r\n\r\nWhen it appeared opposite the United States front on November 3, the\r\ndivision had been completely shattered. The 411th Regiment, for\r\ninstance, had only three companies each with a rifle strength of 100 to\r\n110 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.

On October 20 the 303d Division took over a sector on the Dvina\r\n(region north of Dvinsk.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGA.\r\n\r\n1. The division stayed on the Dvina until September, 1917. It\r\nparticipated in the offensive on the Riga and fought to the north of\r\nFriedrichstadt.\r\n\r\n2. After the taking of the town the 203d Division occupied a sector at\r\nGrenyn. Favored by calm conditions, it gave up men to the 75th Reserve\r\nDivision, which was preparing to go to France. On December 8 it was\r\nbilleted in Riga. About December 18 the 405th Regiment left the Division\r\nand was replaced by the 406th, coming from the 205th Division. In the\r\nmeanwhile the division had brought up its strength by obtaining men from\r\nthe 332d Infantry, which did not intend to leave until March, 1918 (with\r\nthe 77th Reserve Division).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of December the 203d Division entrained for the Western\r\nFront. The 410th left Riga on the 26th.

Before leaving for the Western Front the 405th, which was to\r\nhave remained in (hardly glorious) Russia, changed all its young men for\r\nthe older men in the other two regiments. The 203d was said to have\r\nplayed a part in the Riga offensive. Gen. von Luettwitz commanding the\r\ndivision, was said to have been relieved of his command a short time\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF REIMS.\r\n\r\nThe division continued to hold the sector east of Reims (near Beine)\r\nuntil the German offensive of July 15. It attacked west of Prunay and\r\npenetrated as far as the Vesle. In front of Beaumont it lost very\r\nheavily. After the failure of the attack the division held the sector\r\nfrom Prunay to east of Les Marquises until August 30, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 9th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. It rested near Laon until October 1, when it was reengaged in\r\nChampagne between Orfeuil and Marvaux. In 8 days of severe fighting it\r\nlost very heavily and was obliged to retire from line.\r\n\r\n3. The division was in army reserve until October 15, after which it was\r\nengaged southeast of Vouziers near Olizy and Falaise. On November 1 it\r\nwas opposite the American front and took part in the final retreat of\r\nthe Meuse at Mohon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. By the end of hostilities the\r\ndivision was decimated and completely exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            204th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │407.     │413.     │407.     │413.     │407.     │413.\r\n              │         │414.     │         │414.     │         │414.\r\n              │408.     │415.     │         │120 Res. │         │120 Res.\r\n              │         │416.     │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │4 Sqn. 19 Uhlan    │4 Sqn. 19 Uhlan\r\n              │                   │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │407 F.

Its\r\noriginal composition was the 407th Brigade (413th and 414th Infantry,\r\n13th Corps District, Wurttemberg) and the 408th Brigade (415th and 416th\r\nInfantry, 12th and 19th Corps Districts, Saxony).\r\n\r\n1. The two brigades, which had respectively been trained at the\r\nMuensingen cantonment in Wurttemberg (the 407th) and at Neuhammer (the\r\n408th), were brought together at the end of July, 1916. The division was\r\nthen sent to Belgium. It detrained at Cortemarck on July 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. Almost immediately put in line, the 204th occupied the Dixmude-\r\nBixschoote sector until October 1 and then the Ypres salient\r\n(southeast). At the end of 1916 the 415th and the 146th Infantry were\r\ntaken from the front and transferred to the 212th Division and replaced\r\nby the 120th Reserve Infantry (Wurttemberg), coming from the 58th\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. After four weeks’ rest in the region of Ghent in February, 1917, the\r\ndivision came back to the sector at the southeast of Ypres.\r\n\r\n2. It was relieved on June 10, three days after the British attack\r\nagainst the heights of Wytschaete-Messines. The division was only\r\npartially subjected to this attack, but suffered some losses during the\r\nartillery preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n3. After having been at rest at Gheluvelt on about June 20, the 204th\r\nDivision was transferred to the vicinity of Sarreberg, then on July 8 to\r\nthe west of Basle, where it remained until July 20. From July 20 until\r\nAugust 15 it held a sector in Upper Alsace (north of the Rhone-Rhine\r\nCanal).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. Again sent to Belgium, it went into line to the north of St. Julien,\r\nsoutheast of Poelcappelle, at the end of August. No important\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRÉSIS.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved from the Ypres front on September 13, it took over a sector\r\nnear Cambrai (Boursies-Demicourt; Sept. 24-Nov. 13).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. Relieved about the middle of November, it went back to Flanders,\r\nwhere it alternated with the 58th Division to the north of Poelcappelle\r\nuntil the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division has been entirely made up of Wurttemberg recruits since\r\nDecember, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nFairly good division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. After its relief northeast of Poelcappelle on February 28, the\r\ndivision rested near Lille until March 21. Elements of the division were\r\nin line at Fromelles on March 9 and others participated in a raid (the\r\n13th) in the Boutillerie sector.\r\n\r\n2. The division left the Lille area on March 21 and marched in stages to\r\nDouai, arriving there on the 27th. It was in support northwest of Vitry\r\nen Artois on the 29th. On the 30th it marched toward the battle front\r\nsouth of the Somme via Inchy-Peronne (Apr. 1), Assevillers, Rosieres,\r\nsouth of Moreuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n3. It was engaged in the Braches-Sauvillers sector from April 1 to May\r\n11. It was relieved by an extension of the front of the neighboring\r\ndivisions and retired to rest and train near Chaulnes until June 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE OISE.\r\n\r\n4. The division left Chaulnes about June 5 and marched in three days to\r\nthe Lassigny-Noyon front. It advanced in reserve on the 9th by Gury-\r\nMareuil-Lamotte. It was engaged south of Ribecourt near Bethancourt\r\nuntil the 12th. From the 13th to the 18th the division was in reserve.\r\nIt was reengaged on the night of the 18th–19th and held the sector of\r\nVignemont-Antheuil until the 1st of August, when it was relieved by the\r\n54th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n5. It rested in the suburbs of Lassigny until August 8. It then marched\r\nto Damery, arriving there on the 10th and immediately entering line. In\r\nthe next week the division was thrown back by Damery, Villery les Roye\r\nto Goyencourt. The division suffered heavy losses, including about 370\r\nprisoners near Roye.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n6. The division was railed to Lorraine and rested near Blamont during\r\nSeptember. Drafts amounting to about 700 men were incorporated in the\r\ndivision in mid-September.\r\n\r\n7. The division left Lorraine on October 5 and detrained at Bertry on\r\nthe 7th. It was engaged on October 8 east of Catelet, and in the next 10\r\ndays fell back through Cremont, Maretz, Sains, Souplet, Catillon. Its\r\nheavy losses, including 1,200 prisoners, led to its withdrawal on\r\nOctober 18.\r\n\r\n8. On October 22–23 the division was reengaged southeast of Le Cateau.\r\nIt held there until the breakdown of the line on November 5. Thereafter\r\nit fell back on Maubeuge, through Favril, Limont, Fontaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Before the attack of August it\r\nhad about 2,700 rifles. The losses in August had a depressing effect on\r\nthe morale of the troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            205th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n              │            1916             │            1917\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.   │   Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Infantry.    │              │406.          │403.          │406.\r\n              │              │407.          │              │407.\r\n              │              │439.          │              │427.\r\n              │              │              │              │439.\r\n ─────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                             │             (?)\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │405 F.

(439th: 15th District-\r\n                                 Alsace.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\nThe 205th Division was organized at the end of 1916, partly from new\r\nregiments formed in the interior, partly from regiments taken from the\r\nzone of the armies on the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. The end of November, 1916, the division was reported behind the front\r\n(region northeast of Vilna). At that time it comprised the 406th and\r\n407th Infantry, taken from the 202d Division, and the 439th Infantry\r\nformed in the region of Vilna. With the 226th Division next to it, it\r\nbelonged to the reenforced 3d Reserve Corps (10th Army).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the division was in line on the left bank of the Aa\r\n(Courland). The 407th Infantry lost heavily in January and February.\r\n\r\n2. The division then occupied the front east of Kalzeen (region of\r\nMitau) from April to September.\r\n\r\n3. In October it was identified north of Lake Lobé. During the last\r\nthree months of 1917 many men were taken from this division for the\r\nWestern Front. In this manner it sent men to the 47th Reserve Division\r\nin April, to the 14th Division at the end of October, and to the 75th\r\nReserve Division (before it left) in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division from its origin was of a very mixed composition.

It\r\nwas composed of three infantry regiments—the 359th (9th, 10th, and 120th\r\nBrigade Ersatz Battalions), the 394th, composed of men taken from the\r\n17th Reserve Division, and the 4th Reserve Ersatz (36th, 37th, and 38th\r\nReserve Brigade Ersatz Battalions).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. After holding for some time in September the sector of Dixmude\r\n(359th), the division was sent to the Somme in October, where it was\r\nengaged at four different times (region of Péronne, La Maisonnette, and\r\nvicinity of Marchelepot) and suffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved November 25 and entrained near St. Quentin for Alsace. Took\r\nover the sector of Ban de Sapt until the beginning of January, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Sent to rest in the region of Chateau Salins and went into line about\r\nthe middle of February, 1917, between the forest of Bezange and\r\nLeintrey. Remained there until April 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DES DAMES.\r\n\r\n2. Sent to the Laonnois, where it was stationed near Mont Cornet from\r\nApril 22 to 30, then at Laon from April 30 to May 4. Then went to the\r\nChemin des Dames (Laffaux, west of the Oise-Aisne Canal). Relieved June\r\n10, after suffering very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. After a month’s rest in Lorraine at Blamont-Sarrebourg, the division\r\nwas in reserve about the middle of July in the region of Romagne-\r\nMontfaucon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILL 304.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of July it took over the sector of Hill 304-Pommerieux,\r\nwhere its losses were very heavy during the French attack of August 20\r\n(1,074 prisoners). Relieved in haste two days after this attack and sent\r\nto rest behind the Reims front until the middle of September, and\r\nreceived about 1,000 replacements taken from the Russian front.\r\n\r\n\r\nREIMS.\r\n\r\n5. The division then held the Berru-Cernay sector, where it did not take\r\npart in any important operations (middle of September to Nov. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n6. About November 28 sent to the St. Quentin front (Pontruet sector).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\n“Regiments from Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, and Brandenburg,” according\r\nto a German communique which designated in this fashion the 4th Reserve\r\nErsatz, the 394th Infantry, and the 359th Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division attacked energetically May 24, 1917, at the Panthéon, and\r\nJune 6 at La Royere. Composed of men from the active army, the reserve\r\nand the Ersatz. It is a good division. Its three regiments gave proof of\r\ngood fighting qualities during the many local attacks at the Chemin des\r\nDames.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be noted that in front of Verdun the division did\r\nnot offer any resistance to the French attack of August 20, 1917. As\r\nearly as August 14 two regiments of this division had already had 100\r\ndeserters.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary conditions of this division were bad at this period (many\r\ncases of dysentery).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The 206th Division was withdrawn from line in the sector northwest of\r\nSt. Quentin early in February, and went to rest in the region of Fresnoy\r\nle Grand. After a short stay here it moved to the Fourmies area, where\r\nit received intensive training in open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On March 16 the division began marching toward the front via\r\nWassigny-Fresnoy le Grand-Fonsommes-Fontaine Uterte. On the 20th it\r\nrested in the Hindenburg Third Line. On the 22d it started out again via\r\nLesdins-Fayet, crossed the old front lines northwest of St. Quentin, and\r\nspent the night in the former British lines in the Holnon wood. The\r\nfollowing day it marched to Martigny, where it spent the night in tents.\r\nOn the 24th it crossed the canal; the 4th Reserve Regiment encamped at\r\nVoyennes; the 394th Regiment marched to Bethencourt and attacked along\r\nthe canal without suffering heavy losses. On the 26th, the 394th\r\nproceeded by Damery and Andechy without being engaged; the 359th was\r\nengaged at Guérbigny, and the 4th Ersatz reached the former German\r\ntrenches near Roye. During the night of the 27th–28th the division\r\nentered Montdidier. The 28th, the 4th Ersatz was engaged at Mesnil-St.\r\nGeorges, leaving many prisoners in the hands of the French. On the 30th\r\nthe division attacked at Fontaine sous Montdidier. It was relieved\r\nduring the night of the 12th–13th of April by the 6th Bavarian Reserve\r\nDivision and went to rest in the region of Gruny, Sept-Fours and\r\nLanguevoisin. Here it was reconstituted.\r\n\r\n3. During the night of the 14th–15th it relieved the 45th Reserve\r\nDivision near Assainvillers (southeast of Montdidier). It was relieved\r\nby the 222d Division on May 9, and was sent to the Nesles, where it was\r\nidentified on the 26th. Three days later it received 700 replacements\r\nfrom its depot. It was also trained during the period spent here. Toward\r\nthe end of May it came to the vicinity of Baboeuf (east of Noyon); eight\r\ndays later it was near Bussy; then on June 8 in the Boulogne area.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n4. On the 11th of June it came into line reenforcing the 19th Division\r\nnear Belloy (southeast of Montdidier). It was still in line at the time\r\nof the attack of August 8, during the course of which it was forced back\r\nwith heavy losses as far as Boulogne le Grasse. It was withdrawn near\r\nhere on the 15th.\r\n\r\n5. After a brief rest it came back into line on the 22d near Pontoise\r\n(southeast of Noyon). It was withdrawn on the 30th.\r\n\r\n6. On the 6th of September it came back into line near Fresnes (south of\r\nPeronne). It was relieved by the 105th Division on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n7. On the 3d of October it relieved the 3d Naval Division, north of\r\nRumilly (south of Cambrai). From the 8th until the division was\r\nwithdrawn (about the 11th) it was heavily engaged and severely punished,\r\nlosing some 1,200 prisoners; it was forced back to Carnières (east of\r\nCambrai).\r\n\r\n8. The division rested and refitted for a fortnight and then reenforced\r\nthe front on November 1 near Villers-Pol (southeast of Valenciennes). It\r\ncontinued in line but was made to fall back; prisoners were captured on\r\nthe 11th at Hyon (south of Mons).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 206th was rated a second-class division. The division commander was\r\ndecorated after the battle of the Somme. On the other hand, the brigade\r\ncommander issued an order (Oct. 6) to remedy straggling in the division.\r\nOn the whole, however, the division did well, though not brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            207th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │89 Res.  │413.     │89 Res.  │98 Res.  │89 Res.  │98 Res.\r\n              │         │209 Res. │         │209 Res. │         │209 Res.\r\n              │         │213 Res. │         │213 Res. │         │213 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │(?)

Relieved about June 3 and went back into line in the region of Ypres,\r\neast of Messines, June 12 to July 6. Did not have heavy losses in spite\r\nof serious fighting.\r\n\r\n4. In July sent to rest in the vicinity of Roubaix.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n5. Beginning on the night of August 1–2, it was again engaged east of\r\nYpres in the vicinity of Hollebeke and Zandvoorde, and counterattacked\r\nto recapture Hollebeke. Remained in this sector until October 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n6. On October 20 took over the sector north of Lens, where it alternated\r\nwith the 220th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nA composite division.

The division continued to hold the quiet Loos sector until April 13,\r\nwhen it was relieved by the 220th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSEE CANAL.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged north of the La Basse Canal on the night of April\r\n13–14. The 98th Reserve Regiment attacked on the 18th on the canal.\r\nAfter the attack the three regiments held the line to the south of the\r\ncanal until the end of April.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested in early May. On the 18th it was engaged south of\r\nthe La Basse Canal, near Hulluch and Anchy les La Basse. It held this\r\nsector without event until it was relieved on the night of July 1–2 by\r\nthe 10th Erzsatz Division. The regiment marched to Wahagnies, entrained\r\nat Libercourt on the 3d and detrained near Bac St. Maur on the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEUX BERQUIN-CAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n4. It relieved the 44th Reserve Division during the nights of July 3–4\r\nand 4–5 near Vieux Berquin. After a month it exchanged sectors (between\r\nAug. 6 and 8) with the 52d Division which had been holding a sector\r\nsouth of Lens. The sector continued quiet in August and September. The\r\ndivision was relieved on the night of the 24th–25th by the 111th\r\nDivision and reenforced the front northwest of Cambrai on September 28.\r\nAfter three days of severe fighting and heavy losses it was obliged to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n5. The division was taken to Deynze about October 8 and came into line\r\non the 14th near Thielt between Pittem and Iseghem. It was pushed back\r\ntoward Denterghem (18th–19th) and later toward the line Courtrai-Ghent\r\n(Deynze, Tulte, Waereghem, Oct. 21 to Nov. 1). The division withdrew to\r\nreserve on November 1 and thereafter was out of line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class.

Its three infantry regiments came from\r\nolder divisions—the 25th from the 15th Division, the 185th from the\r\n185th Division, the 65th Reserve from the 16th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\nBefore being transferred to the 208th Division these regiments were\r\nengaged in the battle of the Somme, where the 18th Infantry especially\r\nwas particularly tried (July 5–18).\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n1. On September 3 the division was sent to the Eastern Front, via\r\nLuxemburg-Aix la Chapelle-Berlin-Leipzig-Cracow-Lemberg.\r\n\r\n2. Fought at Brzezany and Halicz from the middle of September to the end\r\nof October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. About the beginning of November it returned to the Western Front, via\r\nLemberg-Budapest-Vienna-Salzburg-Rosenheim-Munich-Frankfurt-Cologne-Aix\r\nla Chapelle-Liege. Detrained November 13 at Caudry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME-ANCRE.\r\n\r\n4. On November 18 it went into line north of the Ancre, where it was\r\nseriously engaged in a series of local attacks.\r\n\r\n5. Relieved December 12 and went to rest northeast of Ghent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1917 the division took over the sector\r\nYpres-Comines Canal, which it held until February 25.\r\n\r\n2. After a month’s rest in the region north of Ghent it returned to the\r\nfront (sector Bixschoote-Langemarck) from March 28–29 to middle of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. April 24 the division was engaged before Arras between Gavrelle and\r\nRoeux and was severely tried during the British offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE (OISE).\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the Artois front May 8 and went into line in a quiet\r\nsector south of St. Quentin, between Berthenicourt and Moy, where it\r\nremained for more than three months, May 14–15 to August 18. Received\r\nabout 1,000 replacements, among others from the 616th Infantry\r\ndissolved, in May.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. About August 23 went to Flanders, via Origny-Le Cateau-Mons-Ghent-\r\nDeynze-Lichtervelde. September 4–5 it went into the sector of\r\nLangemarck. Though already sorely tried by artillery fire, it was\r\nsubjected to the British attack of September 20, which again caused it\r\nvery heavy losses. The 1st and 3d Companys of the 185th Infantry were\r\nentirely destroyed or captured; the rest of the 1st Battalion was\r\nreduced to a handful of men (letter).\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MIHIEL.\r\n\r\n6. Left the Flanders front September 29 and went to Lorraine where it\r\ntook over the St. Mihiel sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI-ST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n7. November 26 it entrained for the region of Cambrai where the 25th\r\nInfantry fought on the 30th in support of the 34th Division. The\r\ndivision then held the sector southwest of Villers Guislain-north of\r\nEpehy until the beginning of February, 1918. Relieved at that time, and\r\nat the beginning of March took over the sector west of Bellenglise,\r\nnorthwest of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 185th Regiment is a Baden regiment (German communiqué of Nov. 26,\r\n1916). The other two regiments are from the Rhineland, and thus the\r\ndivision may at times be designated under the general appellation of\r\n“Rhenish troops.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division took part in many battles on different fronts and generally\r\ndid well.\r\n\r\nWhen it was put in line at Ypres in September, 1917, 25 per cent of its\r\nfighting forces belonged to the 1918 class, and these young elements\r\nseem at this time to have weakened the fighting spirit of the division.\r\n(Information from the British, October, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in the Bellenglise line sector when the attack of\r\nMarch 21 began. By the evening of the 21st it had advanced as far as le\r\nVergnier. The next day it advanced via Bernes and Catigny and entered\r\nPeronne on the following day, remaining there until the 25th, when it\r\ncrossed the Somme near Biaches. On the 26th the division advanced 4\r\nkilometers encountering slight opposition, and on the 27th advanced 12\r\nkilometers without opposition. It reached Framerville on the 28th after\r\nsome fighting and on the 29th was engaged against a British\r\ncounterattack between Cayeux and Beaucourt. A day or so later it was\r\nretired from the front near Marcelcave. The casualties of the division\r\nin the offensive were estimated by the British as 70 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGARD.\r\n\r\n2. It rested near Clery, in the vicinity of Peronne, from April 1 to 18.\r\nIt came into line north of Hangard (night of Apr. 21–22) and was heavily\r\nengaged until May 4. Again the division suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. The division went to rest in the Valenciennes area on May 7. About\r\nJune 4 it entrained and traveled via Mons-Namur-Charleville-Conflans to\r\nChambley, where it detrained a day later. On the night of June 4–5 it\r\nentered line of the quiet St. Mihiel sector and stayed there until the\r\nend of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved on July 28, at St. Mihiel, the division was transported to\r\nthe Noyon area, and on August 12 was engaged near Belval (south of\r\nLassigny). In the next two months the division was constantly being\r\npressed back. The line of its retreat was through Beaurains-Genvry-\r\nGuiscard-Berlancourt-Ville Selves-Crigny-Flavy le Martel-Benay-Cerisy\r\n(south of St. Quentin). It was relieved by the 1st Reserve Division on\r\nSeptember 30.\r\n\r\n5. After hardly a week’s rest, the division reentered lines near Cambrai\r\n(southwest of Merguies, later Haussy) about October 8. It held in that\r\nsector until the 23d. Few days later it was reengaged between\r\nValenciennes and Le Quesnoy (Ruesnes), but after a few days in line\r\nretired from the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It took a prominent part in the\r\nMarch offensive and thereafter was a strong defensive division. Although\r\nits effectives were greatly diminished in the fall, its morale remained\r\nabove the average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            211th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[33]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │27.      │211.     │27.      │211.     │27.\r\n              │         │75 Res.  │         │75 Res.  │         │75 Res.\r\n              │         │103 Res. │         │390.     │         │390.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │1 Sqn. 2 Uhlan Rgt.│1 Sqn. 2 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │269 F.

These three regiments fought in July to\r\nAugust, 1916, in the battle of the Somme before being assigned to the\r\n211th Division.\r\n\r\n1. About September 20, its organization being completed, the division\r\nwas sent north of the front of the Somme, to put up defensive works in\r\nthe region of Nurlu-Manancourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. October 14 it went into line at the St. Pierre-Vaast wood, from where\r\nit was relieved November 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n3. It then took over the sector north and west of Soissons (Nov. 20).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 103d Reserve was transferred to the 58th\r\nDivision (Saxon) and replaced by the 390th, recruited in the Rhineland\r\nand Hessa, coming from the 16th Reserve Division, which had been formed\r\nfrom drafted companies as well as from elements of the 21st and 25th\r\nDivisions and 25th Landwehr Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. The division, thus composed, held the Soissons sector until about\r\nMarch 20. On this date it retired through Terny, Margival, to\r\nVauxaillon, where it established its lines and opposed the French attack\r\nof April 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFFAUX.\r\n\r\n3. Temporarily withdrawn from the front on April 20, the division went\r\nto the north of Laffaux, south of Vauxaillon, from May 10 to 25. During\r\nthese two periods on the Aisne front the division suffered heavy losses\r\n(especially the 27th, which had already received men from the 1918\r\nclass, among other reenforcements, at the end of April). It was\r\nreorganized partly from the dissolution of the 625th Infantry (Hessian).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST OF ST. GOBAIN.\r\n\r\n4. June 25 the division held the forest of St. Gobain (sector of\r\nBassoles-Aulers). At the end of July it took over the sector of Cerny-\r\nMalval Farm.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of December it went to rest and train at Gizy (west of\r\nLiesse) and vicinity for four weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe three infantry regiments came from three different Prussian\r\nProvinces-Prussian Saxony (27th Infantry), Schleswig-Holstein and Hanse\r\ntowns (75th Reserve), Hesse-Nassau, 390th Infantry. The reenforcements\r\nfrom the Russian front in 1917 also gave a certain number of Hanoverians\r\nfrom the 411th Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division had many losses on the Aisne in April to May, 1917, and was\r\ncompleted by reenforcements containing a strong proportion of the 1918\r\nclass. These young soldiers, according to prisoners’ statements, showed\r\nonly mediocre military qualities (counterattacks at Laffaux).\r\n\r\nDuring the four weeks which it spent in the vicinity of Liesse the\r\ndivision took part in several training exercises (breaking through\r\nmaneuvers on an 8-kilometer front with simulated enemy tanks).\r\n(Interrogation of prisoners, Mar. 7, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved the 8th of March in the Chamouille area and\r\nwent to rest and train near Laon until the 19th. It marched toward the\r\njumping off point east of La Fere by Crepy en Laonnois, arriving there\r\non the 20th. It followed up the attack at La Fere, crossing the Oise\r\nnear Travecy, until the 22d, when it was engaged west of Travecy. It\r\nadvanced through Farguiers-Quessy-Liez-Chauny-Quierzy-Varesnes,\r\nsuffering heavy losses, until the line stabilized near the Aisne Canal\r\nat Manicamp and Champs. It held this sector until May 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n2. When the French retired on the front, following the German advance to\r\nthe Marne, the division advanced as far as Moulin sous Touvent-Nampcel\r\n(May 27–31). It held that sector until the beginning of July. It\r\nwithstood a French attack on July 3, lost 666 prisoners, and was at once\r\nrelieved by the 15th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested until mid-July southeast of Soissons. It was\r\nbrought back on the 20th at Mercin-Vauxbuin to oppose the Allied\r\ncounterthrust and was in line until August 3.\r\n\r\n4. After its withdrawal the division was taken to the neighborhood of\r\nCharleville and dissolved. The 390th Regiment and 75th Reserve Regiment\r\nwere broken up and sent as drafts to the 42d Division and the 87th\r\nDivision. The 27th Regiment replaced the dissolved 32d Reserve Regiment\r\nin the 113th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was in line almost without\r\ninterruption from February to August, 1918. When the effective strength\r\nhad reached a minimum the division was dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            212th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │57.      │20.      │212.     │415.     │         │182.\r\n              │         │114.     │         │416.     │         │\r\n              │         │98 Res.  │         │182.     │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │2 Sqn. 18 Uhlan    │5 Sqn. 18 Hussars.\r\n              │                   │  Rgt.             │\r\n              │                   │                   │Staff, 2 Bav.

At that time it comprised the\r\nfollowing three infantry regiments, taken from already existing\r\ndivisions: The 20th from the 6th Division, the 114th from the 29th\r\nDivision, and the 98th Reserve from the 10th Reserve Division. Later its\r\ninfantry composition was completely changed until the division from\r\nbeing Prussian became entirely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. From September 15 to October 3–5 the division was engaged north of\r\nthe Somme (sector of Cléry to Béthune-Péronne road).\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the front October 5 and sent to rest in the region of\r\nSt. Quentin. Went back into line about the 25th, south of the Somme,\r\nbetween Genermont and Ablaincourt. Suffered heavy losses (the 3d\r\nBattalion of the 98th Reserves lost 297 prisoners).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division left the Somme November 23–25 and went to rest (end of\r\nNovember to beginning of December). Then went to the Champagne front\r\n(sector of Prosnes—south of Ste. Marie a Py).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the division was reorganized. The 98th Reserve and\r\nthe 20th went to the 207th Division and the 5th Guard Division,\r\nrespectively, and were replaced by the 9th Jäger Regiment (from the\r\n199th Division) and the 415th (from the 204th Division). These were\r\nSaxon regiments and they were joined a short time after by the 416th\r\n(also from the 204th Division and Saxon), in place of the 114th,\r\nassigned to the 199th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Thus composed the division continued to hold the Prosnes sector until\r\nthe end of March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about March 25, before the attacks began and sent to\r\nRoumania.\r\n\r\nAt this time the 9th Regiment of Jägers left the division and went to\r\nthe 101st Division, in Macedonia. The 415th and 416th were sent to the\r\nRussian-Roumanian front (region of Braila in July, then Focsani-\r\nTecuciu). The division was brought up to three regiments by the\r\nassignment of the 182d (from the 216th Division), a Saxon regiment. The\r\ndivision suffered heavy losses, especially the 182d Infantry, on\r\nSeptember 9.\r\n\r\n4. In December the division was relieved from the sector west of\r\nTecuciu. The 415th and 416th were identified southeast of Panciu\r\nDecember 14; the 182d, northwest of Namoloasa, on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division at the end of 1917 was entirely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nRemained on the Roumanian front during a part of 1917 and the beginning\r\nof 1918.

Withdrawn from the front at the end of September and moved to Bohain\r\nby stages and from there was transported on October 1 to Coucy le\r\nChateau. On the same day it took over the Nouvron-Vingre sector north of\r\nVic sur Aisne. It remained there until the end of October, and after a\r\nshort rest went back into line in the same region (Moulin sous Touvent-\r\nAutreches) at the beginning of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1.

Relieved August 25 and sent to Champagne (5 weeks’ rest near Asfeld),\r\nthen went into line before Brimont on October 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nTwo of the regiments, the 74th Reserves and the 368th were from Hanover.\r\nThe 149th which as a rule was recruited in the second district\r\n(Pomerania), was as a matter of fact very mixed, like the other\r\nregiments of this district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nA good division. However, the 149th, in line east of Hill 304, offered\r\nno resistance to the French attack of August 20, 1917. The two other\r\nregiments gave no assistance.\r\n\r\nRelatively small proportion of 1918 class men in August, 1917.\r\n\r\nDuring its stay in the rear (January, 1918) the division was trained for\r\nopen warfare. (Examination of prisoners, March, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n1. The division continued to hold the quiet Brimont Courcy sector until\r\nMay 10, when it was relieved by the 242d Division. It rested near Asfeld\r\nuntil the 24th, when it returned to the Brimont sector on the night of\r\nthe 24th–25th, and attacked on the 27th. It advanced through Loivre,\r\nMerfy, and Guex until the line stabilized west of Reims (Vrigny-Ormes-\r\nChampigny). It held that sector until September 27.\r\n\r\n2. It was moved in motor trucks on the 27th to south of Arnes, and the\r\nnext day was engaged near Ste. Marie a Py. The division was engaged\r\nwithout pause until the armistice. In the first week of October it was\r\npushed back to Ste. Etienne a Arnes, losing 560 prisoners. From then it\r\nretreated to east of Machault, between Vouziers and Attigny and later to\r\nthe region northeast of Attigny (Le Chesne-Louvergny). It was last\r\nidentified at Louvergny on November 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its morale remained fairly high,\r\nand the division did well in the Ardennes in September-October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            214th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │50.      │214.     │50.      │214.     │50.\r\n              │         │358.     │         │358.     │         │358.\r\n              │         │363.     │         │363.     │         │363.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │        (z)        │1 Sqn. 16 Hus.

Two of its\r\nregiments came from the Ersatz Divisions—the 358th, former Brigade\r\nErsatz Battalions Nos. 1, 2, 5, and 50; from the Ersatz Guard Division;\r\nthe 363d, former Brigade Ersatz Battalions Nos. 29 (Aix la Chapelle), 30\r\n(Coblentz), and 31 (Trèves), from the 8th Ersatz Division. These two\r\nregiments were for two years in the Haye. The 50th Infantry was taken\r\nfrom the 10th Division (Verdun front).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n1. Started for the Eastern Front September 10, 1916, but was stopped at\r\nFrankfort on Main and brought back to France to oppose the offensive on\r\nthe Somme. Hastily engaged at Rancourt September 19–20, but lost that\r\nvillage. Lost heavily (600 prisoners) and was relieved October 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIS LE PRÊTRE.\r\n\r\n2. From October 15 to November 25 the division held the Bois le Pretre\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n3. At the beginning of December it again went to the Somme in the region\r\nof Bapaume (Gueudecourt).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The division was withdrawn from the Somme about February 6, 1917, and\r\nwent to rest; obtained replacements from the 609th Infantry (Rhineland).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. About February 20 the division was north of Nouroy-Moronvilliers. Its\r\nregiments were successively put in line beginning with the first part of\r\nMarch, then were placed all together in line April 15. April 17 and 18\r\nthe division opposed the French attacks on the Nauroy-Auberive front.\r\nIts losses were considerable (19 officers and 1046 unwounded prisoners).\r\nLosses of the 12th Company of the 50th Infantry, 129 men (document).\r\n\r\n3. On the night of the 18th–19th the division was relieved and sent to\r\nrest southwest of Monthois and reorganized. The 5th Company of the 363d\r\nInfantry received at least 134 replacements, mostly from the 1918 class,\r\nsome of them with only three months’ training.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n4. About May 4–5 the division went back into line south of Rouvroy\r\n(Cernay en Dormois) and stayed there until July 22 or 23. No important\r\naction during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. During the first days of August the division was sent to Flanders via\r\nCharleville, Namur, Brussels, and Ghent. It went to the Bixschoote-\r\nLangemarck sector, where it fought until August 17 (battle of Flanders,\r\nFrench attack of August 16).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. After a rest on the coast it went to Douai August 23 and took over\r\nthe Oppy-Gavrelle sector (September to November). November 22 it went in\r\nall haste to oppose the advance of the British army southwest of\r\nCambrai, and fought until December 4. At that date it was sent to rest\r\nnear Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nA composite division. The 50th (5th District) and the 358th (2d\r\nDistrict) had a pretty large proportion of Poles, and some\r\nBrandenburgers to counterbalance them. The 363d was a Rhenish regiment,\r\nas well as the field artillery of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 214th Division must be considered as a good division. However, it\r\nshould be noted that in Champagne during the attack of April 17, it was\r\nmore or less demoralized by the losses suffered. A large number of men\r\nare said to have fled during the preparatory artillery fire.\r\n\r\nAt Ypres in August, 1917, the 358th and 363d opposed great resistance,\r\nparticularly where there were enough officers to hold the men under the\r\nartillery fire.\r\n\r\nOf the three regiments of the division, the 50th was the worst; many\r\nPoles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Dixmude sector until April 5, when it was\r\nrelieved by the 6th Bavarian Division. It was withdrawn to Couckelaere\r\nand Ichteghem, when it entrained on the 6th and 7th and traveled via\r\nThourout-Lichtervelde-Roulers-Coutrai to Lauwe, from where they marched\r\nto Halluin.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYS.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged north of Armentieres from April 10 to 13 (Ploegsteert-\r\nNeuve Eglise). It was relieved on the 13th–14th and went to rest near\r\nLille until May 19. On May 6 some elements of the division reenforced\r\nthe Alpine Corps at Locre for a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS.\r\n\r\n3. On May 19–20 the division came in line east of Arras (Feuchy-Monchy\r\nle Preux) and held that quiet sector until the British attacked them on\r\nAugust 27. The division lost 1,171 prisoners and was relieved on the\r\n28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested until September 24, when it entered line\r\nsouthwest of Douai (Sailly Ostrevent Biache, St. Vaast) and held there\r\nuntil October 8. It retreated between Douai and Valenciennes as far as\r\neast of St. Awand. It withdrew from line near Conde on the 24th. A day\r\nlater it was reengaged south of Valenciennes (Famars) and in line until\r\nNovember 5. On the first 10 days of November the division lost 750\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. In 1918 it played a rather\r\ncolorless rôle. Its hardest fighting was in October in the Cambrai\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            215th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │61 Res.  │60 Res.  │61 Res.  │71 Ldw.  │61 Res.  │224 Res.\r\n              │         │2 Res.   │         │224 Res. │         │2 Res.\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │         │         │  Ers.\r\n              │         │40 Ers.  │         │2 Res.   │         │\r\n              │         │  (Saxon).│         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n              │61 Res.  │71 Ldw.  │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │2 Res.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │40 Ers.  │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  (Saxon).│         │         │         │\r\n              │         │244 Res. │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │  (Saxon).│         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┬┴─────────┴────────┬┴─────────┴────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Sqn. 8 Res.

The 215th Division, formed about September, 1916, and comprising at\r\nthis time the 40th Ersatz Regiment, taken from the 19th Ersatz Division;\r\nthe 2d Reserve Ersatz, from the 1st Reserve Ersatz Brigade; the 60th\r\nReserve, from the 13th Landwehr Division, was identified for the first\r\ntime on September 29, 1916, on the Champagne front, east of Auberive. It\r\noccupied the sector of Prosnes, south of Ste. Marie a Py, until the end\r\nof November.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved in Champagne, the 215th Division was transferred to the\r\nEastern Front, leaving the 60th Reserve Regiment in France as a part of\r\nthe 221st Division and taking with it the 71st Landwehr Regiment from\r\nthe 13th Landwehr Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n3. Arriving in Russia at the beginning of December, the 215th Division\r\nformed a part of the 22d Reserve Corps (Army of the Bug) and was\r\nreenforced by the addition of the 244th Reserve Infantry Regiment from\r\nthe 53d Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of 1917 the composition of the 215th Division was\r\nagain changed—the 244th Reserve Infantry Regiment went over to the 119th\r\nDivision and was replaced by the 224th Reserve Infantry Regiment from\r\nthe 48th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n2. During the year 1917 the 215th Division occupied, in Volhynia, the\r\nsector situated east of Gorokhov (northwest of Berestiecko).\r\n\r\n3. Its composition was once more modified—the 40th Ersatz Regiment was\r\ntransferred to a newly formed Saxon division, the 96th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 215th Division was fairly homogeneous. It was mostly recruited from\r\nthe 11th and to some extent from the 18th Corps Districts (Thuringia,\r\nthe Electorate of Hesse, and Hesse-Nassau).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division had been in Russia since December, 1916, and was only\r\nmediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Early in the year the division was still in Russia. It was identified\r\nnear Kiev on the 12th of March and in the Kharkov region in April. Early\r\nin May the division had advanced to the Sea of Azov. Early in September,\r\nall unmarried men less than 35 years of age (Alsace-Lorrainers included)\r\nwere sent to the Western Front, which probably explains the many reports\r\nof the division having been sent to France.

At the time of formation it comprised the\r\n182d Infantry Regiment, from the 123d Division (Saxon), the 354th\r\nInfantry Regiment from the 38th Division and the 21st Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment from the 217th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA-TRANSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In Galicia (Brzezany) beginning of October, the 216th Division was\r\ntransferred to the Transylvanian front (valley of the Olt) on November\r\n8.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n2. It took part in the Roumanian campaign.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of December it was south of Rimnicu-Sarat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. In January, 1917, the 216th Division was in line east of Focsani,\r\nwhere it remained until August.\r\n\r\n2. It took part in the attacks north of Focsani in August, where the\r\n182d Infantry Regiment lost especially heavily.\r\n\r\n3. At this time the 42d and 59th Infantry Regiments, filled up in June\r\nby men borrowed from the 76th Reserve Division, then in the rear of the\r\nRoumanian front replaced the 182d Infantry Regiment, transferred to the\r\n212th Division and the 21st Infantry Regiment, sent to the Macedonian\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n4. With this composition the 216th Division occupied the line north of\r\nthe mouth of the Buzeu. It was still there at the end of December. The\r\n354th Infantry Regiment was identified on December 28 by fraternizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 42d Infantry Regiment, Pomeranian, and the 59th Infantry Regiment,\r\nfrom Posen, also contained contingents from the 2d, 5th and 20th Corps\r\nDistricts, and since 1915 have contained a large number of Alsace-\r\nLorrainers. The 354 Infantry Regiment, formed from mobile depot\r\nbattalions of the former Breslau Garrison, replaced its 3d Battalion\r\n(Saxon) by Prussians, and consisted almost entirely of drafts from\r\nSilesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 216th Division fought and held sectors almost entirely on the\r\nRoumanian front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. On the 1st of April the division started for the Western Front. It\r\ntraveled via Bucharest-Budapest-Prague-Dresden-Leipsig-Erfurt-Frankfort-\r\nThionville-Luxemburg-Namur-Mons-Valenciennes, and detrained at Orchies\r\nand Somain from April 12 to 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEMME.\r\n\r\n2. It entered line at Kemme on May 9 and with the exception of the first\r\nweek in June held that sector until June 18.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested and underwent training north of Courtrai\r\n(Oostroosebeke-Marialoop) until July 23. It was then railed to Laon and\r\nmarched toward the front south of Fismes through Urcel, Brenelle,\r\nBozoches, Mont St. Martin. It was in reserve northeast of Cierges on\r\nJuly 28–29.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESLE-AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. It was engaged near Cierges and west of the Bois Meuniere on July 29\r\nand 30. The next day it returned north of Cierges and later to the Vesle\r\neast of Fismes (Magneux). The division lost heavily in their retreat. It\r\nheld the sector on the Vesle until September 5, when it fell back\r\nthrough Merval toward the line of the Aisne. It held on the line west of\r\nRevillon, south of Villers en Prayeres until October 10. Again it gave\r\nway before the Allied pressure and retired through Bouconville, north of\r\nAubigny (11th–12th), Montaigu (13th) toward Liesse-Sissonne. In this\r\narea the division was withdrawn from line on October 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n5. Without having had an opportunity to rest, the division was returned\r\nto line northwest of Chateau Porcien on October 25 and fought until\r\nNovember 5.\r\n\r\n6. At the time of the armistice the division was considered in reserve\r\nof 5th Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its conduct during the retreat to\r\nthe Vesle was good. The three months of constant service in line greatly\r\nfatigued the troops and lowered the morale of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            217th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │         │45.      │18 Ldw.  │9 Res.   │18 Ldw.  │9 Res.\r\n              │         │9 Res.   │         │22 Ldw.  │         │22 Ldw.\r\n              │         │22 Ldw.  │         │29 Bav.  │         │21 Res.\r\n              │  Nov. to Jan. 1   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │9 Res.   │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │22 Ldw.  │         │         │         │\r\n              │         │21 Res.  │         │         │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │47 Res.

The 207th\r\nReserve Infantry Regiment coming from the 44th Reserve Division, the\r\n55th Reserve Infantry Regiment and the 2d Reserve Guard Division and the\r\n99th Reserve Infantry Regiment from the 26th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n1. Concentrated at Boyelles (west of Croisilles) on February 6, 1917,\r\nthe 220th Division went into line at Ransart, south of Arras. About\r\nMarch 18 it took part in the retirement of the German forces and\r\nestablished its position at Hénin sur Cojeul, Ecoust St. Menin,\r\nCroisilles. It was engaged, in April, between Croisilles and Arras. In\r\nApril the 190th Infantry Regiment replaced the 207th Reserve Infantry\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawn from the Arras front at the end of April, the 220th\r\nDivision was sent to rest in the vicinity of Montagne du Nord, then to\r\nBelgium between May 6 and 15.\r\n\r\n3. It came back to its old sector in Artois (Fontaine les Croisilles,\r\nBullecourt) about May 29, and remained there until about July 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n4. After a rest in the rear of Douai, northwest of Lens, from the\r\nbeginning of July to the middle of August, the division was engaged near\r\nLens from August 16 to 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n5. At the beginning of October it was sent to Belgium. On the 12th it\r\nwent into line east of Zonnebeke.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. Sent to rest about October 15 in the vicinity of Bruges, it then\r\nfought on the Cambrai front, south of Crèvecoeur, at the end of November\r\n(German counterattack).\r\n\r\n7. It was sent to rest in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 220th Division may be considered as Westphalian since two of its\r\nregiments were normally filled up from the 7th Corps District, and since\r\nthe 99th Reserve Infantry Regiment, like a number of regiments in\r\nAlsace, received most of its men from there.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe regiments of the 220th Division did not appear to have any great\r\noffensive value.\r\n\r\nThe division lost quite heavily in the sector of Lens at the beginning\r\nof 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n1. During the night of December 31-January 1 it relieved the 1st Guard\r\nReserve Division in the Hulluch-Loos sector (south of La Bassée). On the\r\n27th it was relieved by the 1st Guard Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n2. A day or two later it relieved the 207th Division in the sector to\r\nthe right of the one it had just held. During the night of the 18th–19th\r\nof February it was relieved by the 207th Division.\r\n\r\n3. It went back to the Lens sector then and relieved the 1st Guard\r\nReserve Division on the 20th. It was not withdrawn until April 25, when\r\nit was relieved by the 42d Division. During these three months the\r\ndivision had about 1,600 casualties (mainly gas), and so now a week or\r\nso was spent refitting in the region north of Douai.\r\n\r\n4. On May 6 it relieved the 44th Reserve Division southeast of Locon\r\n(west of La Bassée). This front had been stabilized by now, but still\r\nthere was a great deal of artillery activity and constant raiding. The\r\ndivision was withdrawn about the 1st of August, the neighboring\r\ndivisions extending their fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPAUME.\r\n\r\n5. After a fortnight’s rest the division reenforced the front in the\r\nBiefvillers sector (northwest of Bapaume) about the 20th of August. It\r\nwas withdrawn about the 3d of September after losing some 600 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. It rested again for a fortnight, and then reenforced the front near\r\nBlécourt (north of Cambrai) about the 29th of the month. It was heavily\r\nengaged here and suffered severely; withdrawn on the 13th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIENNES.\r\n\r\n7. About the 21st it reenforced the front near Anzin (northwest of\r\nValenciennes). It was withdrawn on November 4.\r\n\r\n8. On the 7th it was put back into line near Elouges (southwest of\r\nGhislain); it was not withdrawn before the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 220th Division was not used in any of the German offensives during\r\n1918; on the contrary, its rôle seems to have been that of a holding\r\ndivision. The 55th Reserve Regiment was mentioned as having displayed\r\n“marked gallantry” in the German communiqué of October 2. It is rated as\r\na second-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            221st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │       1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │1 Res.   │41.      │1 Res.   │41.      │1 Res.   │41.\r\n              │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │\r\n              │         │60 Res.  │         │60 Res.  │         │60 Res.\r\n              │         │1 Res.   │         │1 Res.   │         │45.\r\n              │         │  Ers.   │         │  Ers.   │         │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Sqn. 2 Res.

A short time after its formation the 221st Division was transferred\r\nsouth of the Somme. On October 21–23 it went into line east of Berny; it\r\nremained there during the entire winter of 1916–17 and launched only a\r\nfew local attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of March, 1917, the division withdrew with the German Army\r\nto the new positions on the Hindenburg Line, northwest of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about April 8, it rested for 10 days near Tournai, and on\r\nApril 27 went into line in the sector of Guémappe-Monchy le Preux\r\n(southeast of Arras). It was seriously engaged against the British\r\noffensive until May 8–9.\r\n\r\n3. About May 28 it returned to the Hindenburg Line between Moeuvres and\r\nHavrincourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. On July 12 it left this sector for Flanders, where it was sent into\r\nreserve near Winckel-St. Eloi. It did not take part as a whole in the\r\nBritish attack of July 31. On August 1 the entire division was engaged\r\nin the sector of Zonnebeke, where it launched a violent counterattack,\r\nin the course of which it lost heavily.\r\n\r\n5. The 221st Division was relieved from the Ypres front during the night\r\nof August 3–4, but left some units in line until the 10th. Transferred\r\nto Champagne, it went into line east of Auberive on August 17, without\r\nhaving had any rest. It there filled up its effectives (with\r\nreplacements comprising a large proportion of the 1918 class). Its\r\nactivity was not manifested there except by a few raids.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n6. On November 7 the division left the Champagne front, was transferred\r\nto Belgium, and remained at rest at Deynze until November 23. On this\r\ndate it was taken by railroad to the Cambrai front, attacked by the\r\nBritish troops. Sent into line between Bourlon and Fontaine-Notre Dame\r\non the 27th, it took part in the German counterattack. Relieved on\r\nDecember 7, it rested for a month in the vicinity of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was very mixed. The 1st Reserve Ersatz Regiment,\r\noriginating in the Guard depots, was recruited from the entire Province\r\nof Prussia; the 41st Infantry Regiment (from East Prussia) was one of\r\nthe regiments of the Prussian Army which had received the most\r\nreplacements because of losses; the 60th Reserve Infantry Regiment\r\ncomprised a majority of Westphalians and men from the Rhine Province,\r\nbut also a large number from other corps districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 221st Division always gave a good account of itself in the battles\r\nin which it took part. The 1st Reserve Ersatz Regiment, especially, in\r\nthe course of the attacks of November, 1916, showed great tenacity on\r\nthe defensive and great vigor on the offensive.\r\n\r\nThe morale of the 221st Division was good in November, 1917. The general\r\ncommanding the division and the major commanding the 41st Infantry\r\nRegiment both received the order “Pour le Merite.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division continued to hold the sector near the Arras-Cambrai road\r\nuntil shortly before the March offensive. It was withdrawn, given a\r\nshort rest, and attacked on the 21st at Queant. In two days it advanced\r\nas far as Ervillers (north of Bapaume). From the 25th of March to April\r\n16 it rested in close support.\r\n\r\n2. On April 16 the division was engaged the second time in the battle.\r\nIt entered south of Arras in the Boyelles sector and remained there\r\nuntil May 25, when it was relieved by the 5th Bavarian Division.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested and trained for almost two months in the locality\r\neast of Douai (Bruille, Somain, Aniches). The 45th Regiment, coming from\r\nthe Macedonian front, replaced the 1st Reserve Ersatz Regiment, which\r\nwas dissolved. Toward the end of July the division marched by stages to\r\nNoyon. It was held in reserve west of that place from July 30-August 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SANTERRE AND SECOND BATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n4. On August 9 the division was engaged at Arvillers-Hangest. In two\r\ndays it was thrown back on Andechy, west of Roye. It was re-formed to\r\nthe north and then to the southwest of Nesle (Aug. 11–17). It was\r\nreengaged on the 18th, and between that and the 27th fought north and\r\nsouth of the Avre near Roye (St. Mard-Sancourt). Again it was pushed\r\nback on the Canal du Nord at Buverchy-Libermont (Aug. 26–27). Its\r\nretreat continued toward Ham (Sept. 3–4) and St. Quentin (5th–8th).\r\nAfter that the division was in line near Fontaine les Cleres and Dallon\r\nuntil September 28. About 1,000 prisoners were taken from the division\r\nin this last sector.\r\n\r\n5. The division was reengaged almost immediately south of Joncourt,\r\nLevergies, and Sequehart (Sept. 30). By October 10 it had reached\r\nFresnoy le Grand. It was withdrawn on the 10th and rested a week near\r\nBergues sur Sambre.\r\n\r\n6. On the 18th it was engaged in the sector of the forest d’Antigny\r\n(near Wassigny). It retreated across the Sambre Canal on the 19th and\r\npassed into reserve. On the 24th it was reengaged near the Serre River\r\n(west of La Ferte Chevresis). In the final retreat it fell back through\r\nLa Herie la Vieville, Laigny, and east of Vervins. It was in line on\r\nNovember 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as second class. It was used as an attack\r\ndivision in the March offensive and as a counterattack division in the\r\nlast three months of the war. It was noted for its energetic higher\r\ncommand. When called in to oppose the French attack near Roye in August,\r\nthe division had a rifle strength of 4,000. By the end of October this\r\nhad been reduced to about 1,000. The 45th Regiment was reduced to four\r\nsmall companies by October 24. The 41st and 60th Reserve Regiments had\r\nbut three companies to a battalion.\r\n\r\nThe division fought very well in spite of its losses and fatigue in the\r\nfinal months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             222d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[35]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │7.       │193.     │7.       │193.     │7.       │193.\r\n              │         │81 Res.  │         │81 Res.  │         │397.\r\n              │         │397.     │         │397.     │         │81 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                   │3 Sqn. 2 Res.

Its third regiment, the 397th, was\r\nformed at Stenay from elements of the 16th and 53d Reserve Regiments\r\n(13th Reserve Division), of the 159th Regiment (14th Reserve Division),\r\nof the 118th Infantry Regiment (56th Division), and especially from the\r\n140th Infantry Regiment (4th Division).\r\n\r\n1. From September 15 to October 24, 1916, the 222d Division was at rest\r\nin Alsace in the vicinity of Rouffach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Entrained on October 25, it was transferred to the vicinity of\r\nCambrai by way of Sarrebruecken, Aix la Chapelle, Brussels, Tournai.\r\nAbout November 5 it went into action on the Somme front near Lesboeufs,\r\nLe Transloy, and remained in line until December 7–8.\r\n\r\n3. After a few days of rest it was sent by railroad into the Laonnois.\r\nDetraining at St. Erme between December 15 and 29 it took over the\r\nsector of the Ville aux Bois (southeast of Craonne), which it occupied\r\nuntil February 15, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. Upon its release the 222d Division was employed in defensive works\r\nbehind the Aisne-Oise front (north of La Fère, St. Gobain, Laffaux,\r\nChavignon).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. About March 16, 1917, it was engaged east of Soissons (Vregny-Combe\r\nPlateau); counterattacked on March 21 north of Missy sur Aisne; retired\r\nin the direction of the Laffaux Mill-Jouy-Aizy (at the beginning of\r\nApril) and fought on this front April 18 to 21.\r\n\r\nThe 193d Infantry Regiment, sent as reenforcement troops to Soupir,\r\nsuffered serious losses there and retired by way of Ostel on April 20.\r\n\r\n3. The 222d Division, having established its position between Laffaux\r\nMill and Malmaison Farm, was again severely tried during the attacks of\r\nMay 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n4. Withdrawn from the Aisne front on May 13, it was sent to rest in the\r\narea Marle-Vervins and reorganized.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of June the division took over its former sector\r\n(Laffaux), where the attack of July 8 was the only important action in\r\nwhich it took part during this time, which lasted until the beginning of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n6. After a short rest in the vicinity of Montigny, it came back into\r\nline (Ailles—north of Hurtebise) about September 5 and remained in this\r\nsector until November 2. At this time it took part in the withdrawal and\r\noccupied new positions north of the Ailette.\r\n\r\n7. On November 28, the 222d Division was relieved in the sector of\r\nChermizy and sent to rest at Laon and in the vicinity of Marle (one\r\nmonth’s training).\r\n\r\n8. At the end of December it occupied the front Brancourt-Anizy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 81st Reserve Infantry Regiment and the 193d Infantry Regiment were\r\nrecruited in the Rhine districts (Hesse-Nassau, Rhine Province, and\r\nWestphalia). Many elements from these same regions were in the 397th\r\nInfantry Regiment in addition to Pomeranians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAlthough it had suffered only slight losses since the beginning of\r\nNovember, 1917, the 222d Division was exhausted by a stay of more than\r\nseven months in the different sectors of the Aisne. It is a mediocre\r\ndivision (January, 1918).\r\n\r\nDuring its rest in December the division received continual but moderate\r\ntraining, like the maneuvers of peace times. (Interrogation of prisoner,\r\nFeb. 4, 1918.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAILETTE.\r\n\r\n1. This was a very quiet sector and the division remained here without\r\nincident until the Somme offensive was well under way. However, the\r\ndivision took part in the attacks of April 7 and 8, when the enemy\r\nendeavored to squeeze out the new salient of Coucy le Château, which was\r\ndeveloped by the progress of the main advance toward Montdidier. It\r\nsuffered heavily in several attacks but gained little ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTDIDIER.\r\n\r\n2. About the 3d of May the division was withdrawn and sent to the front\r\nsoutheast of Montdidier, where the main battle line had stabilized, but\r\nwhere infantry was still continuing, and during the night of the\r\n9th–10th relieved the 206th Division in the Assainvillers sector.\r\nHowever, the sector soon grew quiet. The division remained in line and\r\ntook part in the battle of the Oise on June 9, advancing via Courcelles\r\nto Mery. The division made but little headway (it will be remembered\r\nthat this whole offensive failed) and suffered heavy losses in several\r\ndays of hard fighting. It was relieved by the 11th Division about the\r\n8th of July and went to rest near Coucy le Château.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n3. During the night of the 25th–26th the division reenforced the front\r\nnear Nouvron (northwest of Soissons). Here it was subjected to the full\r\nweight of the attack of the 18th of August and was driven back to\r\nAudignicourt and the Ailette. After having suffered very heavy losses\r\n(1829 prisoners), it was withdrawn about the 27th and went to rest near\r\nLaon. About the middle of September it was disbanded, the 81st Reserve\r\nRegiment going to the 21st Reserve Division, the 193d Regiment going to\r\nthe 14th Division, and the 397th Regiment going to the 45th Reserve\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 222d was rated a second-class division. It took little part in\r\noffensive operations but was not incapable of putting up a tenacious\r\ndefense. In June two of its regiments threatened to leave the trenches\r\nif they were not relieved, but the difficulty seems to have been\r\nsmoothed over though there was no relief until July 8. It is interesting\r\nto note that the divisions receiving regiments when the 222d was\r\ndisbanded were all second-class units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             223d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[36]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │67.      │144.     │67.      │144.     │67.      │144.\r\n              │         │173.     │         │173.     │         │173.\r\n              │         │29 Ers.  │         │29 Ers.  │         │29 Ers.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Sqn. 3 Res.

Its regiments formerly belonged to other divisions. The\r\n144th Infantry Regiment was taken from the 3d Division on the Verdun\r\nfront; the 173d from the 34th Division, then at Thiaumont; the 29th\r\nErsatz from the 39th Bavarian Reserve Division, on the Lorraine front.\r\n\r\n1. Entraining at Mulhousen on October 26, 1916, the 223d Division was\r\ntransferred to the north by way of Sarrelouis-Treves-Aix la Chapelle-\r\nLouvain-Brussels-Valenciennes, and detrained north of Cambrai on October\r\n28. During the night of November 11–12 it came to the Ancre front\r\n(Serre-Grandcourt) and lost heavily there.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about November 25, it was sent to rest in the area east of\r\nCambrai. Elements of the 173d Infantry Regiment were sent on detached\r\nservice south of Bapaume (Ligny-Tilloy).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. At the end of January, 1917, the 223d Division left the Cambrai area\r\nfor Champagne. It occupied the sector north of Rheims (Witry les Rheims,\r\nMarch and April).\r\n\r\n2. About April 27 it was engaged south of Nauroy at Mont Cornillet and\r\nlost heavily between April 30 and May 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn from the Champagne front about May 18, the 223d Division\r\nwas transferred to Galicia. (Itinerary: Amagne (May 21)-Sedan-\r\nThionville-Sarrebruecken-Frankfort-Leipzig-Breslau-Cracow-Lemberg.) It\r\ndetrained at Zloczow, May 26.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of July it opposed the Russian offensive in the\r\nvicinity of Brzezany; on July 18, it took part in the Austro-German\r\ncounterattack and marched in the direction of Husiatyn, which it reached\r\non the 30th and remained in line there until the middle of December. It\r\nwas sent in reserve on this date, and prepared to leave for the Western\r\nFront, borrowing men from the regiments of the 83d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 223d Division was recruited from Westphalia and the Rhine Province\r\nso far as concerns the 144th and 173d Infantry Regiments. The 29th\r\nErsatz Regiment came from the Grand Duchy of Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 223d Division may be considered good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested in a camp at Sissonne until March 19, after which\r\nit was railed to La Fere, arriving there on March 21.\r\n\r\n2. On the second day of the attack it was engaged near Tergnier-Chauny\r\nand advanced to the Guiscard region by the 24th. Shortly after its\r\nwithdrawal from Guiscard (25th) it took over the Morlincourt-Appilly\r\nsector on the Oise (east of Noyon) and held it until May 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST OF OISE.\r\n\r\n3. It rested near Guiscard during the first half of May. On the 15th it\r\nwas engaged in front of Noyon (Larbroye-Mont Renaud-Pont l’Eveque) until\r\nthe 30th. It took part in the Oise offensive of June, crossing the river\r\nand advancing in the Bois de Carlepont in the direction of Caisnes and\r\nCuts. It established itself on the line Bailley-Tracy le Val-Oise and\r\nheld that sector until the French attack of August 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE-AISNE.\r\n\r\n4. The French attack of the 18th threw the division back on Salency. It\r\nwas relieved on the 22d and railed to Anizy le Chateau the same day.\r\nFrom there it was taken to north of Soissons and reengaged on the 29th\r\non the line Chauvigny-Juvigny. In these two engagements the division\r\nlost 688 prisoners.\r\n\r\n5. The division had lost heavily in March and in the August fighting.\r\nIts morale was poor. The authority of the officers was low and\r\ndesertions were frequent. As a result the division was dissolved in\r\nSeptember. Its effectives were turned into the 52d, 103d, and 115th\r\nDivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.

Upon its formation the 224th Division appeared on the Eastern Front\r\nabout October, 1916.\r\n\r\n2. At this time it was near the 31st Division, north of Lake Narotch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA-SVINIOUKI.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of February, 1917, the composition of the 224th\r\nDivision appeared to be as follows: 19th Landwehr Regiment taken from\r\nthe 18th Landwehr Division; 61st Landwehr Regiment, from the 85th\r\nLandwehr Division, and the 429th Landwehr Regiment, a new formation\r\n(1916).\r\n\r\n2. The 224th Division then occupied the sector of Sviniouki in Volhynia.\r\nIt remained there during the entire year of 1917, during the latter\r\nmonths furnishing important replacements to the Western Front, to such a\r\ndegree that in November the companies of the 429th Landwehr did not have\r\nmore than 100 men left (Russian interrogation).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 224th Division was recruited from Brandenburg and the eastern\r\nProvinces of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was on the Russian front from its formation and was of\r\nmediocre combat value.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1917, in Volhynia, 50 men of the youngest classes were\r\ntaken from each company of the 429th Landwehr Regiment to be sent to the\r\nFlanders front.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, the companies of the 61st Landwehr Regiment were\r\ncomposed of men of the Landsturm. (Prisoner’s statement, Jan. 13.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLHYNIA.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of March the division left the Sviniouki region and\r\nwent via Pinsk to Gomel.\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. Toward the end of April the division was identified in the Vorojva\r\nregion (southwest of Koursk). On the 9th of September the division was\r\nidentified a little farther to the north in the Delgorod region.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n3. On September 29 the division was relieved (probably by the 45th\r\nLandwehr Division) and, entraining at Sadtowo, traveled via Kubiantz-\r\nKharkov-Kiev-Kovel-Kattovitz-Dresden-Frankfort on the Main-Saarbrueken-\r\nMetz-Batilly, where it detrained on October 12. Resting here until the\r\n16th, it marched via Bruville-Mars la Tour-Chambley and relieved the\r\n88th Division during the night of the 16th–17th south of Dampvitoux. The\r\ndivision was identified by prisoners on November 7 here and does not\r\nseem to have been withdrawn before the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was a very poor one. About the middle of the summer the\r\nbest men were chosen to be sent to the Western Front. They were paraded\r\nbefore the commanding general and when they reached the place where he\r\nwas standing they dropped their guns and went back to the caserne. Later\r\nwhen the whole division was to come to the west, the men were far from\r\nsatisfied, not being entirely consoled when they were informed that they\r\nwere to enter a quiet sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            225th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n              │       1916        │       1917        │     1918[37]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────\r\n              │Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.│Brigade. │Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Infantry.    │5 Ers.   │18 Res.  │5 Ers.   │18 Res.  │5 Ers.   │373.\r\n              │         │217 Res. │         │217 Res. │         │18 Res.\r\n              │         │373.     │         │373.     │         │217 Res.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────┼─────────┴─────────\r\n Cavalry.     │3 Sqn. 13 Uhlan    │3 Sqn. 13 Uhlan    │3 Sqn. 13 Uhlan\r\n              │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.             │  Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │                   │225 Art.

In November, 1916, the 225th Division was transferred to the\r\nRoumanian Carpathians. It was there in December in the valley of the Uz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n1. During the first half of 1917 the 225th Division occupied the calm\r\nsectors in the vicinity of Uz (Hills 1031 and 1640).\r\n\r\n2. In July the 373d Infantry Regiment was transferred to the valley of\r\nthe Putna to withstand the Russo-Roumanian offensive. The division took\r\npart in the Austro-German counterattack and established its positions\r\nnear Ocna in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about November 11, it went to Bereczk, where it entrained on\r\nthe 18th for the Western Front. (Itinerary: Kronstadt (Brasso)-Budapest-\r\nVienna-Munich-Carlsruhe-Sarrebruecken.) It detrained on November 25 at\r\nVallieres-Vantoux, near Metz, and from there was transferred to the\r\nvicinity of Vigneulles (Cote de Meuse).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n4. On December 4–5, it took over the sector of Chevalierswood, south of\r\nVaux les Palameix-Seuzey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nTwo regiments were drawn from East Prussia (18th Reserve and 372d\r\nInfantry Regiment), the 217th Reserve from Westphalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 225th Division which comprised drafts from Baden, Alsace,\r\nWestphalia, East Prussia, and the Rhine was not homogeneous and was not\r\nconsidered as a fighting division.\r\n\r\nThe 18th Reserve Regiment had a bad reputation. On January 6, 1917, it\r\nrefused to attack at Hill 1298 in Hungary. (Interrogation of prisoners\r\nFeb. 3 and Mar. 17, 1918.)\r\n\r\nThe division included a large number of Poles. However, men of the young\r\nclasses gradually replaced the older men, who still made up a large part\r\nof the division in 1917; consequently, the combat value of the division\r\nmay have improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the Woevre sector until the beginning of May. It\r\nentrained at Jeandelize about May 15 and was railed by Sedan, Givet,\r\nDmant, Namur, Charleroi, Mons, and Cambrai. It detrained near Peronne\r\nand marched toward the Avre front by Chaulnes, Rosieres en Santerre.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE SANTERRE.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged north of Moreuil (east of the Villers aux Erables-\r\nThennes) on May 22. The Allied attack struck the division and threw it\r\nback on Beaufort, losing 2,358 prisoners. It was relieved on the 10th\r\nand rested 15 days. Reengaged on the 25th east of Albert (Contalmaison,\r\nMontauban) the division again lost heavily. It was withdrawn on the\r\n30th.\r\n\r\n3. After its withdrawal the division was dissolved to the profit of the\r\n1st Reserve Division and 2d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.

At the end of December it was identified on the Eastern Front in the\r\nvicinity of Smorgoni, forming, with the 205th Division, the 3d\r\n(reenforced) Reserve Corps of the 10th Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 226th Division included in 1917 the 2d and 9th Landwehr Regiments\r\n(5th Landwehr Brigade), taken from the 35th Reserve Division, and the\r\n439th Infantry Regiment, formed in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n2. The division occupied the sector of Smorgoni-Krevo from January until\r\nAugust, 1917. In this sector it received the Russian attacks of July 2\r\nand 23, which caused it very heavy losses, in consequence of which\r\nEmperor William II called himself commander of the 2d Landwehr Regiment.\r\n\r\n3. About the beginning of August the 226th Division was relieved south\r\nof Smorgoni and replaced the 123d Division south of Lake Svir. In\r\nNovember the 2d Landwehr Regiment sent men to reenforce the 121st\r\nDivision and the 9th Landwehr to reenforce the 2d Guard Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE NAROTCH.\r\n\r\n4. In December the division was in line north of Lake Narotch, relieving\r\nthe 31st Division, which was sent to the Western Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was still there in January, 1918. It was dissolved in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.\r\n\r\n2. The presence of the headquarters of the 226th Division at Targovistea\r\nwas reported early in October. These headquarters apparently had under\r\nits order the 58th Reserve Field Artillery Regiment, of which the\r\nheadquarters and three batteries are at Bucharest, the remaining\r\nbatteries at Durnu Margurelf, Targovistea, and Cantulung.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as fourth class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            227th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │49 Ldw.      │417.         │49 Ldw.      │417 and 477.\r\n              │             │441.         │             │\r\n              │             │477.         │             │\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │            (?)            │1 Sqn. 10 Hus.

The 227th Division was identified for the first time on March 27,\r\n1917, on the Argonne front. It occupied the calm sector of the Fille-\r\nMorte until May 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. About June 1 it went into line south of the Aisne (La Neuville-Godat)\r\nand extended its sector, at the beginning of July, to Hill 108\r\n(Sapigneul).\r\n\r\n3. Relieved about August 5, it was sent for rest and training to the\r\nAsfeld area. On August 20 it went into line north of Berry au Bac,\r\nbetween the Miette and Hill 108, from which it was withdrawn on August\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe division did not take part in any important engagement on the Aisne\r\nfront. Its losses were very slight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. On October 5 and 6 the 227th Division entrained at Amagne (east of\r\nRethel), and was transferred to Belgium by way of Hirson-Toumai-\r\nCourtrai-Thielt. Detraining at Pitthem on October 6 and 7, it reached\r\nthe front north of Poepcappelle on the night of the 8th–9th, was in\r\naction for a week and suffered very heavy losses.\r\n\r\n5. The division left the Ypres front about October 15 to go to Ghent\r\n(two days), then into the Champagne in the vicinity of Aussonce. It was\r\nfilled up with three replacements, the most important of which was made\r\nup of 1,200 men taken from units on the Eastern Front, especially from\r\nthe 12th Landwehr Division, from the same Provinces as the 227th\r\nDivision (end of October).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. At the beginning of November the 227th Division went into line north\r\nof Cornillet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 227th Division was recruited from the Rhine Districts (Baden, Hesse-\r\nNassau, the Rhine Province), which gives rise to a certain homogeneity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 227th Division lost very heavily in Flanders and received as\r\nreplacements a certain number of men coming from the Russian front whose\r\ncombat value was mediocre (October, 1917).\r\n\r\nThe 227th Division was of only mediocre offensive value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. About the middle of January the 227th Division was relieved by the\r\n28th Division and went to the Juniville area, where it was intensively\r\ntrained in open warfare with a view to its being used as an assault\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n2. On February 16 it relieved the 28th Division. It was withdrawn toward\r\nthe end of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n3. About the 10th of April it relieved the 5th Guard Division near Canny\r\nsur Matz (west of Lassigny). The battle of the Somme had come to end by\r\nthis time, and so, although there was still considerable artillery\r\nactivity here, the division was not seriously engaged in infantry\r\nattacks, and remained in line until relieved by the 75th Reserve\r\nDivision during the night of May 16–17, when it went to rest and be\r\ntrained in the region of Ham.\r\n\r\n\r\nOISE.\r\n\r\n4. On June 7 it started to march to the front via Ognolles-Champien\r\nWood-Beuvraignes-Crapeaumesnil. On the 9th it attacked through the line\r\nand succeeded in passing Ricquebourg, Ressons, and Marqueglise. This\r\nadvance cost the divisions heavy losses, and it suffered still more\r\nheavily when the French counterattacked in force on the 12th. The\r\nfollowing day it was relieved by the 17th Reserve Division and marched\r\nby stages to the region east of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n5. About the 20th it entrained at Origny and traveled via Charleville-\r\nSedan-Longuyon-Conflans-Dampvitoux, where it detrained the 21st and 22d.\r\nIt relieved the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division in the St. Baussant-\r\nRichecourt sector (south of Thiaucourt) on the 27th. It was relieved by\r\nthe 10th Division on the 22d of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOISSONS.\r\n\r\n6. About the 30th it reenforced the front in the Terny-Sorny sector\r\n(north of Soissons). It was withdrawn about the 8th of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n7. There was some talk of dissolving the division at this time, but it\r\nwas not done, and it came back into line, relieving the 17th Division in\r\nthe Pont-Arcy sector (east of Vailly) on the 17th. It remained in line,\r\nfalling back via Monchâlons-Coucy les Eppes-Pierrepont-Montcornet-\r\nEbouleau-Renneval-Jeantes la Ville. It had not been withdrawn on the\r\n11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 227th was rated a third-class division. It was in no heavy fighting\r\nduring 1918 until June, when it did not distinguish itself, neither\r\nadvancing far nor holding its ground in counterattack. Its conduct,\r\nhowever, can not be characterized as poor. It is to be noted, moreover,\r\nthat the division commander was awarded “Pour le Mérite” in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            228th.

Its three regiments belonged to the 3d Corps District—the 35th\r\nFusileer Regiment was taken from the 56th Division, the 48th Infantry\r\nRegiment from the 113th Division, and the 207th Reserve Regiment from\r\nthe 220th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n1. On June 22, 1917, the 228th Division was identified on the Verdun\r\nfront in the sector of Les Chambrettes (35th Fusileers). It was still in\r\nline on the right bank of the Meuse (Louvemont) when the French attacks\r\nof August 20–24 were launched. It lost heavily there. “Our regiment has\r\nonly two companies left” (letter from a man of the 48th Infantry\r\nRegiment, Aug. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\nCÔTES DE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved about August 24, it was sent to rest for a few days, then\r\ninto line again about September 6 on the Côtes de Meuse (between\r\nMoulainville and Damploup). It was reorganized in both men and material.\r\nAt the end of September 900 men came as replacements from the 1st Corps\r\nDistrict (returned wounded for the most part). The 35th Fusileer\r\nRegiment, decimated in August, remained in the rear for reorganization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division was purely Brandenburg (infantry and field artillery).\r\n\r\nFor its reorganization after the attacks of August 20–24, 1917, the\r\n228th Division received replacements from the 1st Corps District. A\r\nreplacement unit was formed from the 3d Corps District, but the men are\r\nsaid to have refused to leave for the Western Front. In default of men\r\nfrom Brandenburg, they called upon the 1st Corps District.\r\n(Interrogation of prisoner, Sept. 30, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThis was a fairly good division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved northeast of Verdun in mid-February and\r\nwent to rest and train southeast of Montmedy (near Marville) until March\r\n17. It was then railed to Picardy via Montmedy, Sedan, Hirson, Aulnoye.\r\nFrom there it moved toward the front by Croix, Maurois, Beaurevoir,\r\nBellicourt, Roisel, Maurepas, Bray, arriving there on the 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged on the 29th–30th near Le Hamel, north of Marcelcave,\r\nand participated in heavy fighting about Hamel until April 13. All three\r\nregiments lost heavily in the attack. The 207th Reserve Regiment was too\r\nweak to hold more than 160 yards of front. The 35th Fusileer Regiment\r\nlost 700 men in killed and wounded. After resting from April 13 to 18\r\nthe division was reengaged on the 18th. It attacked at Villers-\r\nBretonneux on the 24th without success. After suffering very heavy\r\nlosses the division was withdrawn on April 27–28.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 28th it entrained east of Peronne and was railed to\r\nValenciennes, where it rested until May 6–7. From rest the division\r\nproceeded to south of Vouziers (May 7) and entered line near Tahure on\r\nthe 13th and held that quiet sector until July 15. It did not attack in\r\nthe offensive in Champagne, but remained behind in reserve of the 88th\r\nDivision. Later it was used by battalions in support of units in line\r\nuntil the end of the month.\r\n\r\n4. From the end of July to September 12 the division held a quiet sector\r\nof the line near Maisons de Champagne.\r\n\r\n5. On the 12th it was moved to Spincourt by Mezieres, Sedan, Montmedy,\r\nLonguyon. It rested and trained until the 28th, when it marched toward\r\nthe front at Romagne sous Montfaucon (Sept. 28 to Oct. 2).\r\n\r\n6. The division was engaged near Cunel on October 8. Four days later it\r\nshifted to the right bank of the Meuse (east of Sivry sur Meuse) and\r\nheld there until November 5. It retreated toward Fontaine and Ecurey\r\nafter that date.

Its infantry regiments (442d, 443d, and 444th) were formed\r\nfrom the depots of the Guard and the 43d Reserve Division, likewise a\r\nsubsidiary of the Guard. Initial effectives: 235 to 240 men per company,\r\none-half of the 1918 class, one-fourth of returned sick and wounded,\r\none-fourth men withdrawn from the front. The composition is practically\r\nthe same for the divisions Nos. 231 to 242, as regards infantry and\r\npioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYE.\r\n\r\n1. The 231st Division left the Zossen Camp on March 30, 1917, detrained\r\nat Audun le Roman on April 3, and went into line on the 13th at Flirey\r\n(Haye). It did not show any activity there and left the front on May 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. Entraining at Jaulny on May 16, it was concentrated in the vicinity\r\nof Epoye, northeast of Rheims, and went into line on May 18–19 north of\r\nLa Pompelle.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONT HAUT.\r\n\r\n3. In the middle of June it went into line in the Nauroy sector, between\r\nCornillet and Mont Haut, and suffered the French attack of the 18th,\r\nwhich caused it heavy losses (especially in the 443d Infantry Regiment,\r\nwhere the 10th Company had only 1 officer and 10 men left). It was\r\nrelieved about July 6.\r\n\r\n4. After two weeks’ rest in the vicinity of Rethel the division was sent\r\ninto line at Bermericourt on July 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 231st Division was recruited from the entire extent of Prussian\r\nterritory, the same as the Guard from whose depots it was formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the formation of the 231st Division 40 per cent of the\r\nmen were of the 1918 class. In consequence of replacements, the\r\nproportion of the men of this class appeared to be 50 per cent in\r\nNovember, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe 231st Division opposed an honorable resistance to the French assault\r\nof June 18, 1917, at Le Cornillet.\r\n\r\nHowever, taking into consideration that it has never given proof of\r\noffensive qualities, it seems impossible to class it among the good\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1. Early in February the 231st Division was relieved by the 213th\r\nDivision and went to the Givet-Namur area for training in open warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 21st of March it was in support behind the 45th Reserve\r\nDivision. Two days later it attacked southwest of Ham in the direction\r\nof Esmery-Hallon, suffering heavy losses. It was in reserve near Roye on\r\nthe 28th. Early in April it was resting near Laon, and later in the\r\nmonth it moved to the Marle area, where it was reconstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. It then relieved the 3d Reserve Division in the Bouconville sector\r\n(southeast of Laon) early in May. On the 27th other divisions attacked\r\nthrough its sector, the 231st following up in reserve via Fismes and\r\nFère en Tardenois. It became engaged on the 30th near Beuvardes and\r\nadvanced through Verdilly to Château Thierry; relieved by the 201st\r\nDivision about the 16th of June. It refitted in the Laon region,\r\nentrained at Sissonne, and traveled via Asfeld to Dun sur Meuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDUN.\r\n\r\n4. About the 1st of July it relieved the Bavarian Ersatz Division in the\r\nAvocourt sector (northwest of Verdun). It was relieved by the 37th\r\nDivision on the 7th of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n5. The division traveled via Sedan-Laon-Chauny and reenforced the front\r\nnear Appilly (east of Noyon). In the fighting that followed the division\r\nwas forced to withdraw through Lagny, Champagne, Villeselve, Artemps,\r\nMont d’Origny, and Hauteville. It was withdrawn about the 20th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n6. After having rested about a week it came back into line west of Guise\r\nabout the 28th. Again it fell back, being identified east of Guise and\r\nsoutheast of Etreux. It was still in line on the 11th of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division did not distinguish itself during the battle of the Somme,\r\nbut, on the other hand, it did not do badly, for soon afterwards the\r\ndivision commander was granted “Pour le Mérite.” After the Aisne\r\noffensive the brigade commander also received it. The division was\r\nmentioned in the German official communiqués of September 4 and October\r\n31. Its losses necessitated the reduction of the battalions to three\r\ncompanies but did not lower the morale to any great extent. It should be\r\nconsidered as a good second-class division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             232d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │232.         │445.         │232.         │445.\r\n              │             │446.         │             │446.\r\n              │             │447.         │             │447.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 1 Uhlan Rgt.        │4 Sqn. 1 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │37 F.

It was recruited principally from the 1st and 20th Corps\r\nDistricts (East Prussia).\r\n\r\nAfter its formation the division was sent for training to the Arys Camp\r\nand then, on April 3, 1917, to the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLAND.\r\n\r\n1. On April 6 the 232d Division went into line in the vicinity of\r\nIllukst; it remained there until July.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMORGONI.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved by the 2d Division, coming from Flanders on July 7, it\r\nentrained on the 9th, was transferred by railroad to Soly on July 11,\r\nand from there went to the sector of Smorgoni-Krevo, where it suffered\r\nthe Russian attack of July 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n3. On July 31 the 232d Division left the Smorgoni front for Galicia. It\r\nwent into line northeast of Tarnapol, west of Zbaraz. It was identified\r\nthere on December 25 (fraternization with the Russians). It was during\r\nthis rest period, in November and December, that the division received\r\nits first reenforcements of the 1919 class, which it later took to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 232d Division was recruited from East and West Prussia, with a\r\ncertain number of Alsace-Lorrainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nHaving always occupied the Eastern Front from its formation (beginning\r\nof 1917) until March, 1918, the 232d Division was of mediocre combat\r\nvalue (April, 1918).\r\n\r\nIn the 445th Infantry Regiment the majority of men were very young; many\r\nbelonged to the 1919 class (April, 1918). (Interrogation of prisoner.)\r\n\r\nIn the 2d Company of the 1st Battalion of the 447th Infantry Regiment,\r\none-third belonged to the 1919 class (May, 1918). (Interrogation of\r\nprisoner.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division held the sector west of Vaudesincourt until about May\r\n10, when it went to rest in the Juniville-Neuflize area. While there the\r\ndivision was trained for mobile warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n2. On May 22 the division left the region of Juniville and moved in\r\nthree marches to Lor and Le Thour (north of Asfeld). On May 26 the\r\ndivision left Lor and advanced toward the battle front, following the\r\n86th Division. It passed the former French first line near Juvincourt,\r\narrived near Treslon-Bouleuse on May 29, and on the 30th was engaged to\r\nthe right of the 86th Division, near Sarey, where it relieved the troops\r\nof the 7th Reserve Division.\r\n\r\n3. After that date the division was in the sector on the west bank of\r\nthe Ardre near Chambrecy. The division losses were small during the\r\nfirst three days of the offensive, but later it suffered seriously,\r\nespecially in its unsuccessful attack on Bligny on June 4. The division\r\nwas relieved on the 18th by the 123d Division.\r\n\r\n4. It marched by stages to Asfeld and was railed to Montmedy. On the\r\nnight of June 28–29 it relieved the 19th Ersatz Division in the Beaumont\r\nsector. It held the quiet sector until August 18, when it was withdrawn.\r\nOn the night of August 26–27 the division entrained and traveled via\r\nMontmedy-Sedan-Charleville-Revin-Charleroi-Mons-Valenciennes-Cambrai,\r\ndetraining near Etricourt and Manancourt on August 28 after a journey of\r\n28 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPAUME.\r\n\r\n5. The division was engaged in the Bapaume area (Le Forest,\r\nBouchavesnes, Moislains) on August 29. It lost 1,500 prisoners before it\r\nwas withdrawn on September 9.\r\n\r\n6. It rested in the Le Cateau area until September 21, when it\r\nreenforced the battle front northwest of Hargicourt. After four days it\r\nwas relieved by the 54th Division and rested near La Capelle. It had\r\nbeen there but 10 days when it was hurried to the Oise front by motor\r\ntrucks.\r\n\r\n7. On October 6 it was engaged at Lesdins, with the exception of the\r\n447th Regiment, which remained at rest at Pont a Bucy and joined the\r\ndivision later. It continued in line until about the end of the month,\r\nwhen it retired from the Villers le Sec vicinity. It was considered in\r\nreserve of the German 18th Army at the time of the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as 4th class. By October its morale was very low\r\nand its combat value small. On October 25 the division had but 850\r\ninfantrymen, 300 machine gunners, and 120 trench mortar effectives.\r\nAfter August there were but three companies to a battalion and but two\r\nbattalions to the 446th Regiment in October. Influenced by Bolshevists,\r\nelements of the division refused to go into action in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             233d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │         1918[39]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │243.         │448.         │243.         │448.\r\n              │             │449.         │             │449.\r\n              │             │450.         │             │450.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │                           │3 Sqn. 9 Drag.

It then contained 40 per cent of the 1918 class\r\nand 40 per cent returned wounded.\r\n\r\n1. After six weeks in training at Hammerstein, the 233d Division was\r\ntransferred to Beverloo, where it continued its training from the end of\r\nFebruary to the beginning of April.\r\n\r\n2. About April 10 it occupied a calm sector between La Fère and\r\nAlaincourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n3. On May 16 it left the Oise front and went to Flanders. Sent into line\r\nat Ypres, on both sides of the Ypres-Roulers road (May 19–20), the\r\ndivision had very heavy losses in this sector toward the end of July,\r\nduring the artillery preparation which preceded the British attack of\r\nthe 31st. “In the course of the nine weeks passed in Flanders the 450th\r\nInfantry Regiment lost 900 men, more than half of whom were killed.”\r\n(Letter of Aug. 6.)\r\n\r\n4. Relieved on the eve of the attack, the 233d Division was brought back\r\nby railroad into the Guise area and sent to rest for two weeks.\r\n\r\n5. From the middle of August until September 28 it occupied the sector\r\nof St. Quentin (Gauchy), after having pillaged the city the same as\r\nseveral other divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n6. On October 2 it entrained for Flanders and was sent by way of Origny,\r\nLe Cateau, Maubeuge, Mons, Ath, Ghent, Deynze. From October 5 to 12 it\r\nwas engaged southeast of Sonnebeke and lost very heavily during the\r\nBritish attacks of October 6 and 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n7. The division was withdrawn from the Ypres front on October 12, sent\r\nto rest for four days at Sottegem, then sent to Lorraine by way of\r\nBrussels, Namur, Hirson, Charleville, Sedan, Metz. Detraining at\r\nSarreburg, it rested from the 20th to the 29th, then went into line\r\nsouth of Blamont.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 233d Division was recruited from Pomerania and West Prussia, with a\r\ncertain admixture from the neighboring Provinces (3d and 5th Corps\r\nDistricts).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nA German official document of June 12, 1917, gives the following\r\nappreciation of the troops of the 233d Division engaged at that moment\r\nin the Ypres sector: “These men are too young to be able to furnish\r\nprolonged resistance and to have great endurance in a critical\r\nsituation. Nevertheless, their conduct is generally good. One cannot say\r\nthat this organization is in a good condition; it is not suited for\r\ntrench warfare.” (Report from the 2d Battalion of the 450th Regiment.)\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed, however, that the 233d Division was left in line\r\nnortheast of Ypres until July 29.\r\n\r\nSince that time the division took part in numerous battles and improved.\r\n\r\nIt contained a certain number of Poles and some Alsatians.\r\n\r\nFrom January 20 to February 24, 1918, it received special training for\r\nthe warfare of movement, in the vicinity of Zabern-Haguenau.\r\n\r\nIt was a fairly good division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEMMEL.\r\n\r\n1. The division was railed to Flanders in the middle of April and\r\ndetrained at Zarren (southwest of Thourout). It marched toward the front\r\nsouth of Ypres through Ardoye, Tourcoing. It was engaged on April 25 at\r\nMount Kemmel and took part in the heavy fighting there until May 3. Its\r\nlosses were heavy in this engagement.\r\n\r\n2. The division rested near Sottegem in Belgium until May 19. It was\r\nthen transferred to Peronne. During June a regiment of the division came\r\ninto line southwest of Morlancourt for a short period and reenforced the\r\n54th Division. The rest of the division rested at Caudry, Bretigny,\r\nMorcourt until July 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n3. It was engaged on that date north and south of Alvert, where it was\r\nstill in line at the time of the British attack of August 22. It was\r\nthrown back on Fricourt, La Boisselle, Bazentin le Grand, Montauban,\r\nwhere it was relieved on August 30, after losing 1,422 prisoners.\r\n\r\n4. Following the heavy losses in August the division was dissolved. The\r\n448th Regiment was transferred to the 107th Division, replacing the\r\n227th Reserve Regiment, dissolved. The 405th Regiment replaced the 22d\r\nReserve Regiment, dissolved in the 117th Division; while the men of the\r\n449th Regiment were allotted to the 448th and 450th Regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            234th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │234.         │451.         │234.         │451.\r\n              │             │452.         │             │452.\r\n              │             │453.         │             │453.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │1 Sqn. 13 Dragoon Rgt.     │1 Sqn. 13 Drag.

Its infantry regiments were recruited from the 3d and 4th\r\nCorps Districts (Berlin-Magdeburg) and were composed of men of the 1918\r\nclass (50 per cent) and of returned wounded and men withdrawn from the\r\nfront (50 per cent).\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n1. After three months’ training at Altengrabow, the 234th Division\r\nentrained, on March 28, for the Western Front. Going by way of\r\nMagdeburg-Aix la Chapelle-Liége-Brussels-Mons, it detrained on March\r\n30–31 at Le Cateau, from which place it marched to the sector of Fayet,\r\nnorthwest of St. Quentin (on the Hindenburg Line) on April 8.\r\n\r\nOn April 14 the division was attacked by British troops and lost heavily\r\n(451st Infantry Regiment, 400 prisoners). This regiment again suffered\r\nseriously in the course of violent battles with the French east of\r\nFayet, August 9 to 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. About September 1 the 234th Division was relieved northwest of St.\r\nQuentin and sent to Roulers, by way of Bohain, Le Cateau, Denain, Lille,\r\nCourtrai, and Menin. In reserve first near Hooglede, on the Ypres front\r\nat the time of the British attack, it counterattacked on September 20,\r\nnortheast of St. Julien. On September 23–24 it again went into reserve\r\nand after the British attack of the 26th sent some of its elements into\r\naction southeast of Zonnebeke on September 27.\r\n\r\n3. Exhausted by these battles the division left the Ypres front for the\r\nLille area. It had lost about one-half of its effectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BASSÉE.\r\n\r\n4. It went into line north of La Bassée Canal on October 7, remained\r\nthere six weeks, and about November 24 went to the Cambrai area.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n5. On December 7 it took over the sector north of Bullecourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 234th Division was recruited from Brandenburg and Prussian Saxony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 234th Division lost very heavily at Ypres in September, 1917; these\r\nlosses had some effect upon its morale. At all events, it acquired a\r\ncertain combat experience in the course of these engagements.\r\n\r\nThe 451st Infantry Regiment seemed to be considered the best one in the\r\ndivision by the German High Command.\r\n\r\nIn the 453d Infantry Regiment, September, 1917, many officers belonged\r\nto the Reserve and to the Landwehr; some of these, during the war, were\r\nretired for inefficiency (document).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n1. The 234th Division remained in the Bullecourt sector until relieved\r\nby the 111th Division on the 8th of February, when it went to rest in\r\nthe Douai area.\r\n\r\n2. About the end of the month it relieved the 111th Division. On the\r\nopening of the Somme offensive on the 21st of March, although not\r\nengaged in the initial attack, the division was severely engaged in the\r\nfighting around Croisilles, and on the 31st some of its elements carried\r\nout a costly and unsuccessful attack against Boisleux-St. Mare. It was\r\nrelieved about the 7th of April by the 231st Division.\r\n\r\n3. The division rested a fortnight and then relieved the 111th Division\r\nin the Ayette sector on the 20th. During the night of the 24th–25th of\r\nMay it was relieved by the 17th Division.\r\n\r\n4. About June 21 it relieved the 17th Division. When the British\r\nattacked on the 21st of August, the division was thrown back upon\r\nHamelincourt with heavy losses (including 1,585 prisoners). It was\r\nwithdrawn on the 24th to the Douai region.\r\n\r\n5. On the 22d of September it reenforced the front in the Gavrelle\r\nsector, being withdrawn a few days later.\r\n\r\n6. On the 30th it came into line north of Cambrai in the Tilloy sector.\r\nWithdrawn about the 15th of October.\r\n\r\n7. On the 18th it reenforced the front near Raches (northeast of Douai).\r\nIt was relieved by the 35th Division about the 10th of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 234th was rated a third-class division. In the fighting around Arras\r\nin the spring it acquitted itself fairly well, and its commanding\r\ngeneral received the “Pour le Mérite.” Its conduct during the rest of\r\nthe year was mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            235th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │         1918[40]\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │235.         │454.         │235.         │454.\r\n              │             │455.         │             │455.\r\n              │             │456.         │             │456.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │5 Sqn. 9 Dragoon Rgt.      │5 Sqn. 9 Drag.

Its regiments were made up mostly of men from the 1918 class\r\n(50 per cent) and the remainder from returned sick and wounded and men\r\nwithdrawn from the front (initial strength, 230 to 235 men per company).\r\n\r\n1. After six weeks of intensive training, the 235th Division was\r\nconcentrated at Posen and sent to the Western Front on February 20, by\r\nway of Dresden-Aschaffenburg-Frankfort-Aix la Chappelle-Namur. It passed\r\na new period of training in the Sissonne Camp, and on March 15 was sent\r\nto the St. Quentin area.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of April it went into line in the Itancourt sector.\r\nIts losses were enormous, principally from the attack of April 13, which\r\nnecessitated replacements of 2,216 men during the following weeks.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved at the beginning of July, it was sent to rest east of St.\r\nQuentin (Fontaine Notre Dame).\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n4. On July 25 it entrained at Guise for Belgium. Concentrated in the\r\nvicinity of Iseghem-Roulers, it went to the Ypres front on July 28–31,\r\neast of Wieltje, received the artillery preparation and the British\r\nattack of the 31st, which caused it very heavy losses. The 454th\r\nInfantry Regiment had very heavy losses (4th Company was reduced to 31\r\nmen) and was filled up hastily from the resources of the large depot at\r\nBeverloo (about 60 men per company).\r\n\r\n5. The 235th Division was withdrawn from the front on August 1 and spent\r\na week at rest in Flanders.\r\n\r\n6. In the course of August it was transferred to Laonnois, in the\r\nvicinity of Montcornet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n7. About September 10 it took over the sector of Juvincourt-Corbeny,\r\nwhere the French attack of November 21 again occasioned it serious\r\nlosses (400 prisoners).

The division entrained at Sierentz (Alsace) April 4–5 and traveled\r\nvia Mulhausen, Strasbourg, Treves, Cologne, Lille, Brussels, and Ghent.\r\nIt detrained at St. Andre, north of Lille, on the 8th–9th and rested in\r\nthat vicinity until the 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n2. It entered line east of Robecq on the night of April 22–23 and\r\nremained in that sector until May 11. During this engagement the\r\ndivision lost very heavily.\r\n\r\n3. The division entrained at Lille on the 12th and was railed via Ghent,\r\nBrussels, Namur, Charleville, and Sedan. It detrained north of Briey on\r\nthe 14th.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n4.

Recruited from the 7th and 16th\r\nCorps Districts its regiments were composed of men belonging to the 1918\r\nclass (40 per cent) and of returned wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRESIS.\r\n\r\n1. The 236th Division entrained at the Senne and Paderborn Camps on\r\nApril 11 1917, and went to Cambrai by way of Dusseldorf-Aix la Chapelle-\r\nLiége-Namur-Charleroi-Valenciennes. Detraining at Caudry on April 13, it\r\nwent into line southwest of Cambrai (Trestault-Gouzeaucourt) on the\r\n18th. On April 24 it was attacked by British troops, lost the village of\r\nVillers Plouich, and suffered heavily (340 prisoners).\r\n\r\n2. On May 9 it was sent to rest in the vicinity of Cambrai.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. It then occupied the sector of Cherisy (southeast of Arras) from June\r\n4 to September 2, and did not go into any serious action during this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. The division left Artois at the beginning of September, was sent to\r\nrest at Courtrai until the 17th, went to Iseghem by railroad, then\r\nmarched to Roulers. Until September 20 it remained in reserve as a\r\ncounterattacking division. Between the 20th and 26th, it was in a\r\nviolent battle east of Ypres, toward the Polygon wood and between this\r\nwood and Zonnebeke to oppose the British advance. Before going into\r\nline, on September 20, the 2d Battalion of the 459th Infantry Regiment,\r\nhad lost more than 200 men from artillery fire; on the 22d, the 8th\r\nCompany had only 15 men left.\r\n\r\n5. Withdrawn from the Flanders front, during the night of September\r\n28–29, the 236th Division was sent to rest in the vicinity of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n6. On October 6 it went into line north of the Scarpe, between the Roeux\r\nand the Gavrelle; it enlarged its sector toward the north at the\r\nbeginning of November. It was filled up by replacements taken from the\r\nRussian front; 400 men coming from the 32d Landwehr Regiment (197th\r\nDivision) arrived in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 236th Division was recruited from Westphalia and the Rhine Province.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 236th Division had serious losses while fighting at Ypres and its\r\nmorale was weakened in consequence. It may be considered a mediocre\r\ndivision (February, 1918).\r\n\r\nAccording to a deserter’s statement (Jan. 23, 1918), the 236th Division\r\nwas a shock division in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was engaged from March 21 to April 3. On the March Somme\r\noffensive, first at Cherizy, later at Heninel. It was relieved south of\r\nArras on the night of April 3–4 and moved to Passchendaele by way of\r\nAubigny au Bac, Iseghem, and Meulebeke.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n2. It entered line at Passchendaele on April 6 and held a sector in this\r\nvicinity until June 22, when it was relieved by the 31st Division. The\r\ndivision rested during July at Deynze. It again held the sector\r\nsouthwest of Ypres from August 10 to September 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. The division moved from Flanders by way of Tourcoing-Brussels-\r\nLiége—Aachen-Cologne-Bonn-Bingen-Coblenz-Kreuznach to Strasburg. It did\r\nnot detrain there, but was suddenly ordered to Metz, where it arrived on\r\nSeptember 24 in the afternoon. It marched to Loringen, stayed one night\r\nand marched to Mars la Tour on September 26. The next morning it marched\r\nto Jarny and entrained there, going to Dun sur Meuse (via Longuyon and\r\nMontmedy). From Dun it marched through Doulcon to Villers, then to\r\nCunel, and then forward into position.\r\n\r\n4. The division was heavily engaged from September 29 to its retirement\r\non October 17. It distinguished itself particularly, fighting stubbornly\r\nand successfully for many days in succession. It lost only 413 prisoners\r\nbut its casualties were very heavy, estimated at 3,000. On November 4\r\nthe division was reengaged south of Beaumont and continued in line until\r\nthe armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Apart from the fighting on the\r\nMeuse, the division did not do anything notable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            237th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │244.         │460.         │244.         │460.\r\n              │             │461.         │             │461.\r\n              │             │462.         │             │462.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 13 Uhlan Rgt.       │4 Sqn. 13 Uhlan Rgt.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\r\n Artillery.   │83 F.

Detraining in Russia in the vicinity of Baranovitchi in March, 1917,\r\nthe 237th Division went into line south of Vichnev, on the Little\r\nBerezina, about the beginning of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved on June 25, it was transferred to Galicia by way of Brest-\r\nLitowsk. On July 7 it was sent into line in the vicinity of Konioukhi.\r\n\r\n3. It was engaged on July 21 northwest of Zbrow, and pursued the\r\nRussians by way of Trembowla (July 26) as far as Husiatin, where the\r\nfront became stabilized. The division continued to occupy various\r\nsectors in this area until the end of 1917. It was identified south of\r\nHusiatin on December 12 (fraternization).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 237th Division was recruited principally from the Rhine District.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 237th Division occupied the Russian front from its formation until\r\nthe beginning of January, 1917.\r\n\r\nIts combat value was mediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. On the 4th of January the division was relieved by Austrian troops\r\nand marched by easy stages to Buckas, in the direction of Lemberg. On\r\nMarch 4 it entrained between Brody and Lemberg and traveled via Lemberg-\r\nBrest-Litowsk-Warsaw-Kalisz-Goerlitz-Leipzig-Frankfort on the Main-\r\nThionville-Sedan, detraining at St. Juvin on the 12th. It went into\r\ncantonments at St. Georges.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n2. During the night of the 14th–15th it relieved the 80th Reserve\r\nDivision west of Avocourt. While here it exchanged its Alsace-Lorrainers\r\nfor more trustworthy men of the 9th Landwehr Division. It was withdrawn\r\nabout the middle of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n3. On the 26th and 27th the division entrained at Grandpre and St.\r\nJuvin, went through Sedan and Charleville and detrained at Bucy les\r\nPierrepont (north of Sissonne) on the 27th and 28th. The division then\r\nmarched via Sissonne—the Plateau de Californie-Fismes-Dravegny-Monthiers\r\n(northwest of Château Thierry). On the 1st of June it attacked in the\r\nBelleau wood, as a result of which it suffered heavy losses. It was\r\nwithdrawn about the 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division entrained at Athies (east of Laon) and detrained near\r\nSt. Juvin on the 30th. The division remained here a few days and then\r\nrelieved the 240th Division in the Vauquois sector. While in line here\r\nthe division received more than 2,000 replacements. It was withdrawn on\r\nAugust 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAILETTE.\r\n\r\n5. It entrained at St. Juvin and went to St. Quentin and Ham; then it\r\nwent by truck to the Coucy wood, and then to St. Paul aux Bois (south of\r\nChauny). On the 21st it reenforced the 1st Bavarian and the 222d\r\nDivisions near St. Aubin. It was withdrawn early in September, after\r\nhaving fallen back upon Coucy le Château. It rested then for a fortnight\r\nin the St. Gobain forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERRE-OISE.\r\n\r\n6. On the 25th of September it relieved the 34th Division in the Servais\r\nsector (south of La Fère). The division remained in line until the end\r\nof the war, falling back through Deuillet-Anguilcourt-La\r\nFerté—Chevresis-Villers le Sec to the La Capelle region, and suffering\r\nvery heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 237th was rated a fourth-class division. While it was in line in the\r\nArgonne in the spring the men (encouraged by their officers) fraternized\r\nwith the French troops opposing them. Its morale was influenced to a\r\nmost surprising extent by the measure of success of the German forces.\r\nThe result was that while it was high in the spring it became low as\r\nsoon as the tide turned. On August 22, while the division was in line on\r\nthe Ailette, 80 men, armed and with ammunition, surrendered to 4 French\r\nsoldiers. In this engagement (about 10 days) more than 900 prisoners\r\nwere lost. While the division was in line the last time it lost over\r\n1,000 prisoners. At the end of October the division had only about 800\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            238th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │238.         │463.         │238.         │463.\r\n              │             │464.         │             │464.\r\n              │             │465.         │             │465.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │2 Sqn. 13 Drag.

Its infantry regiments were recruited from\r\nthe 9th Corps District (Schleswig-Holstein, Hanseatic cities, and\r\nMecklemburg) and from the 10th Corps District (Hanover), and were\r\ncomposed in part (50 per cent) of men of the 1918 class.\r\n\r\n1. After a training of almost three months, the 238th Division entrained\r\nat Lockstedt, on April 13, 1917, by way of Hamburg, Trèves, Sedan,\r\nNamur, Cambrai; it went to Caudry and Bertry (north), where it detrained\r\non the 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG LINE.\r\n\r\n2. On April 20 it went into line in the sector of Vendhuille-Bellicourt,\r\nwhich it left on May 20 to go to rest in the vicinity of Douai (until\r\nMay 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS.\r\n\r\n3. At the end of May it took over the sector of Roeux-Gavrelle, north of\r\nthe Scarpe. It remained on this part of the front until September 27 and\r\nwas not in any serious engagement. On June 6, however, the 463d Infantry\r\nRegiment suffered heavy losses in its 3d Battalion, which the two others\r\nhastily filled up (letter of June 10), and left 170 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n4. Sent to Flanders, the division remained at rest for a few days at\r\nRoulers, then in reserve in the vicinity of West-Roosebeke. On October\r\n13 it went into line southwest of Passchendaele. Having suffered heavily\r\nfrom the British attack of October 30, it was hastily relieved on the\r\n31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n5. It entrained on November 6 at Ledeghem. Detraining at Geise, it went\r\nto Macquigny, and after a few days of rest occupied the sector south of\r\nSt. Quentin-Itancourt (Nov. 11–12).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 238th Division was recruited the same as the 111th Division, from\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, Mecklemburg, the Hanseatic cities, and Hanover.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 238th Division was of mediocre value, but better than the majority\r\nof the divisions of this series.\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of young recruits in the ranks of the 238th\r\nDivision gave rise to the nickname “The Division of the First\r\nCommunicants.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested and underwent training in the vicinity of Origny-\r\nSt. Benoite from the 1st of February to March 19. It was brought up to\r\nthe front south of St. Quentin during the night of March 19–20.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. On the 21st the division attacked at Grugies and in two days advanced\r\nby Grand-Serancourt and across the canal near St. Simon. From the 23d to\r\nthe 29th it advanced in reserve by Libermont-Beaulieu les Fontaines-\r\nBeuvraignes. It was reengaged on the 29th at Rollot and Boulogne la\r\nGrasse until mid-April. The division suffered heavy casualties in the\r\nSomme battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS.\r\n\r\n3. The division was engaged southeast of Rheims (Cernay les Rheims,\r\nnortheast of St. Leonard) from April 18 to July 20. It carried out a\r\nlocal attack on Rheims on May 30 and June 1. The division did not take\r\npart in the offensive of July 15 except by artillery activity.\r\n\r\n4. The division rested at Boult sur Suippe from July 20 to 28. From the\r\nend of July to August 20 it held its former sector at Cernay les Rheims.\r\nRelieved in that sector, it marched by stages toward Brancourt-Coucy le\r\nChateau via Neufchatel sur Aisne, Marchais, Bruyeres (Aug. 21–28).\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n5. On August 31 the division was engaged at Leuilly-Terny. After\r\nSeptember 10 it fought in the vicinity of Quincy-Basse-Aulers until\r\nOctober 12. On that date it retired toward Crepy and withdrew from line.\r\nThe division started for Marle to rest but was alerted on the 14th and\r\ntaken in trucks to east of Mart d’Origny. On the 15th it was again in\r\nthe first line. Two of the regiments had but two battalions and the\r\ninfantry effectives totaled 1,800. The period between the 18th and 24th\r\nof October was relatively quiet on the divisional sector. Following\r\nFrench attacks of October 25 and 26, the division fell back on a\r\nprepared position in front of Guise. Here it held until November 5, when\r\nit began a retreat by Audigny in the direction of La Capelle.\r\n\r\nThe last identification was at Buironfosse on November 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. Its morale was mediocre, and its\r\neffectives few during the latter half of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            239th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │239.         │466.         │239.         │466.\r\n              │             │467.         │             │467.\r\n              │             │468.         │             │468.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │4 Sqn. 9 Drag.

It includes the 466th, 467th, and 468th\r\nInfantry Regiments recruited from the 11th and 18th Corps Districts\r\n(Electorate of Hesse, Thuringia, and Hesse-Nassua, and the Grand Duchy\r\nof Hesse).\r\n\r\n1. From the beginning of January, 1917, to the middle of February, the\r\n239th Division was in the training camps Ohrdruf and of Darmstadt. It\r\nentrained on February 17 and went to Rethel. It continued its training\r\nfor some time behind the Champagne front.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n2. The entire division went into line north of Souain (Somme Py) on\r\nMarch 27. It remained there until May 15 without any important\r\nengagement. One battalion of the 467th Infantry Regiment was sent to\r\nAuberive as a reenforcement at the time of the French attack on April\r\n16.\r\n\r\n3. The division was at rest in the vicinity of Machault and at Asfeld\r\nfrom the end of May to the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n4. About June 10 it went into line northeast of Reims (Cernay sector),\r\nthen at the beginning of August northeast of Courcy. It occupied this\r\nsector until October 6 without having any important battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANDERS.\r\n\r\n5. Transferred to Flanders by way of Hirson and Courtrai, the 239th\r\nDivision went into line northeast of Poelcappelle on October 23. It lost\r\nheavily during the British attack of November 26 and continued to hold\r\nthis sector, alternating with the 3d Naval Division.\r\n\r\n6. Relieved about November 24, the 239th Division was sent to rest\r\nnortheast of Ghent, then to the vicinity of Lille, at the beginning of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 466th Infantry Regiment came from the Electorate of Hesse; the 467th\r\nRegiment was called Thuringian in an official document; the 468th\r\nRegiment came from Hesse-Nassau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 239th was a fairly good division.\r\n\r\nConsidering the missions which have been assigned to it by the German\r\nHigh Command, it seems that the 239th Division is better than most of\r\nthe divisions of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division trained in the Bourghelles area until March 17. On that\r\ndate the division marched toward the front via Bersee-Douai-Estrees-\r\nSoudemont-Villers les Cagnicourt-Noreuil-Mory.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It came into line on the 26th north of Courcelles, attacking Ayette\r\non the 27th. It lost heavily, including numerous prisoners on April 2.\r\nThe division was relieved on April 6 and rested a week at Aubigny au\r\nBac. It entrained on the 11th and moved to Libercourt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDES.\r\n\r\n3. The division was engaged from April 15 to 23 east of Robecq. Elements\r\ntook part in the attack of the 18th, in which the losses were very\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n4. After its relief on the 23d the division was railed to Lorraine by\r\nMons-Namur-Sedan-Montmedy-Metz. It rested and was reconstituted near\r\nDieuze from the end of April to May 13. At this time the division was\r\nreenforced by a draft coming from the 233d Reserve Regiment of the\r\ndissolved 195th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVRICOURT.\r\n\r\n5. The division held the quiet Avricourt sector from May 13 to June 20.\r\nIt was relieved by the 7th Cavalry Division and railed to Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n6. It rested and trained in the vicinity of Rethel-Attigny. About the\r\n10th of July it marched toward the front and on the 15th was engaged in\r\nthe Champagne offensive at Vaudesincourt. After the attack it held the\r\nsector until the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n7. The division was attacked at Mont sans Nom on September 26, and on\r\nOctober 4 fell back on the line Betheniville-Hauvine, and later in the\r\ndirection of Rethel (Oct. 12). The division was in reserve during the\r\nmiddle of October. Toward the end of the month the division was\r\nreengaged near Rethel. Its line of retreat in the last weeks was through\r\nLe Quesnoy, Jolimetz, Bermeries, south of Bavai, where it was identified\r\non November 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class. In October the division was very\r\ntired and its morale was low. Numerous infractions of discipline\r\noccurred. Its battalions were reduced to three companies at the\r\nbeginning of August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            240th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────\r\n              │           1917            │           1918\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────\r\n              │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.  │  Brigade.   │  Regiment.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Infantry.    │240.         │469.         │240.         │469.\r\n              │             │470.         │             │470.\r\n              │             │471.         │             │471.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────┼─────────────┴─────────────\r\n Cavalry.     │8 Sqn. 13 Drag.

Like all the divisions of this series, the 240th\r\nDivision received a large contingent from the 1918 class at the time of\r\nits formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE.\r\n\r\n1. After a period of intensive training (Feb. 4 to Mar. 28) in the\r\ntraining camps of Oberhofen and of Heuberg, the 240th Division was sent\r\nto Mulhousen about the end of March and went into line between the\r\nRhone-Rhine Canal and Hirzbach (south of Altkirch) until August 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOEVRE.\r\n\r\n2. About August 25 it was sent to the Woevre in the sector of Calonne\r\ntrench, in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPRES.\r\n\r\n3. Entraining at Conflans (Oct. 5–6) it appeared in Flanders on the 9th.\r\nIt went into action between the Ypres-Staden railroad and Poelcappelle\r\nand suffered heavy losses in the course of the British attacks of\r\nOctober 9 and 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI.\r\n\r\n4. Relieved during the night of October 13–14, it was sent to Artois. On\r\nOctober 23 it took over the sector of Bullecourt (southeast of Arras).\r\nOn November 20, it lost heavily from the British attack launched north\r\nof Bullecourt at the same time as on the Cambrai front (700 prisoners).\r\n\r\n5. About the middle of December it was withdrawn from the front and sent\r\nto rest in the vicinity of Douai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 240th Division was recruited principally from Baden, some elements\r\nfrom the Rhine Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe 240th Division appeared to be of mediocre combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENS.\r\n\r\n1. The division was in line in the sector Fresnoy-Oppy at the beginning\r\nof the Somme offensive. It took no part in the attack on Vimy Ridge of\r\nMarch 28, but remained in support. It was relieved in this sector on\r\nApril 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LYS.\r\n\r\n2. It moved northward and was engaged north of Bethune (Hinges-Robecq on\r\nApril 14.) In two weeks’ fighting in this sector the division lost very\r\nheavily including many prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONNE.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawn on April 27, the division rested at Lille a week. It\r\nentrained about May 8 for the Argonne and detrained at St. Juvin.\r\nEngaged at Boureuilles-Vauqunois on May 13 the division held that quiet\r\nsector until July 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n4. The division was taken to Semide and held in reserve during the\r\noffensive of the 15th to be used as an exploiting division. When the\r\nattack failed the division was directed west of Reims via Machault,\r\nWarmeriville, Brimont. It camped at Jonchery from July 21 to 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nREIMS.\r\n\r\n5. On the 23d the division was engaged in the Bois de Reims. After the\r\n27th it retreated on the Montagnes de Bligny, and later toward Aubilly-\r\nBouleuse. On August 5 it passed into second line, and was relieved 10\r\ndays later. It rested 5 days west of Chateau Porcien and returned to\r\nline in the Prunay sector on August 13. There it held firm until October\r\n10.\r\n\r\n6. After its relief it waited near Rethel until the 14th, when it was\r\nrailed to Stenay via Sedan. On October 17 it was engaged north of St.\r\nJuvin, Champigneulle, east of the Argonne forest. It continued in line\r\nuntil the end, retreating toward Mouzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class.

The 472d Infantry\r\nRegiment was originally in the 12th Corps District (Dresden) formed in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n1. On March 1, 1917, the 241st Division went to Brest-Litowsk. In April\r\nit took over the sector of Postavy in the vicinity of Lake Narotch,\r\nwhere it remained until the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALICIA.\r\n\r\n2. Relieved by the 21st Division, it entrained on June 17 at Sventsiany,\r\nnorthwest of Lake Narotch, and went to Galicia, southwest of Brzezany,\r\ndetraining on June 22. At the beginning of July, it went into line in\r\nthis region and took part in the German counteroffensive at the end of\r\nJuly advancing south of Skala at the beginning of August. It took up a\r\nposition on the Zbrucz.\r\n\r\n3. After this time the 241st Division occupied various sectors of the\r\nGalician front (Koroskow, Husiatin).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 241st Division was entirely Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Eastern Front from the time of its formation until\r\nFebruary, 1918. “Our new regiment is a gang of headstrong kids.” (Letter\r\nfrom a man of the 473d Infantry Regiment, Apr. 2, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division rested in the vicinity of Signy l’Abbaye until March 15.\r\nIt then proceeded by steps toward the St. Gobain forest (Fressancourt,\r\nMar. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged south of the Oise (Amigny-Septvaux) from March 25–26\r\nto April 5. Between the 6th and 9th it advanced from Septvaux and\r\nFresnes toward Coucy, encountering heavy losses. The division received\r\nthe thanks of the King of Saxony for its conduct in this fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n3. The division held the sector of Coucy le Chateau until May 29. On the\r\n29th it attacked and advanced as far as Crecy au Mont. It halted on the\r\nline Nouvron-Vingre and held there until relieved at the end of June. In\r\nthe attack of June 5–6 toward Vic sur Aisne the division lost heavily.\r\nOn the 23d of June it received a draft of 1,500 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE.\r\n\r\n4. It rested near Coucy le Chateau for about a week, and on July 10 was\r\nengaged south of the Aisne between Ambleny and Pernaut. Then it was\r\nstruck by the Allied attack on the 18th and thrown back on Mercin. The\r\ndivision lost 42 officers and 2,074 men as prisoners alone. It was\r\nrelieved at a date between July 22 and 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n5. The division rested and was reconstituted at Vouplaix, Sains\r\nRichaumont near Vervins until August 20. It was moved to La Fere (22d)\r\nand on the 25th engaged east of Noyon (Baboeuf-Appilly) and September 4.\r\nAfter that date it fell back gradually by Chauny, Fravecy, on Vendeuil,\r\nwhere it was relieved about September 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRAI-ST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n6. After 10 days’ rest the division was reengaged north of St. Quentin\r\n(Romicourt-Montbrehain) from October 1 to 10. It lost about 1,900\r\nprisoners in this engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE-ARGONNE.\r\n\r\n7. The division rested nearly a month at Audun la Roman after October\r\n22. The 7th Saxon Jaeger Regiment from the dissolved 197th Division had\r\nreplaced the dissolved 472d Regiment when it appeared in line on\r\nNovember 5 east of the Meuse.

Like all of the\r\ndivisions of the same series, the 1918 class entered largely into the\r\ncomposition of the regiments (475th and 476th). These two were recruited\r\nfrom the 13th Corps District (Wurttemberg). Initial effectiveness, 235\r\nto 240 men per company.\r\n\r\nThe 127th Infantry Regiment is an active peace-time regiment taken from\r\nthe 27th Division.\r\n\r\n1. On March 11, 1917, the 475th and 476th Infantry Regiments left the\r\ncamp of Muensingen, where they had received training since January, and\r\nwent to Lorraine. They were joined there by the 127th Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n2. From March 29 to April 30 the 242d Division was in line between\r\nAbaucourt and Bezange wood.\r\n\r\n3. From May 4 to 15 it was employed upon defensive works north of the\r\nSuippe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE-CORNILLET.\r\n\r\n4. During the night of May 15–16 it went into line south of Nauroy\r\n(Grille-Cornillet wood), where the French attack of May 20 caused it\r\nheavy losses (3 officers and 194 men prisoners). Several companies of\r\nthe 476th Infantry Regiment remained in the Cornillet tunnel.\r\n\r\n5. The 242d Division was relieved during the night of May 31-June 1, and\r\nafter a few days’ rest northeast of Lavannes went into line in a calm\r\nsector near Betheny from June 3–4 until August 6.\r\n\r\n6. The 242d Division was at rest in the Charleville area from August 7\r\nto 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE.\r\n\r\n7. On August 20 it was transferred to the right bank of the Meuse\r\n(Beaumont sector). It received the French attack of August 26 (7\r\nofficers and 390 men prisoners, mostly from the 475th Infantry\r\nRegiment). It counterattacked to relieve Beaumont and remained in line\r\nuntil September 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n8. From the beginning of October until December 16 it held the sector of\r\nBerry au Bac, where its only activity consisted in one raid on November\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe 242d Division was recruited entirely from Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn Champagne the 242d Division showed itself energetic and tenacious\r\n(May, 1917).\r\n\r\nIt was a good division, with a high morale, and the prisoners talked\r\nvery little (December, 1917).\r\n\r\nThe 242d Division was listed as an assault division and received the\r\ntraining for divisions of that category (February-March, 1918).\r\n\r\nThe 475th and 476th Infantry Regiments, however, were considered only\r\nmediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division marched to its entraining point at Bergnicourt (west of\r\nJunville) on March 22–24 and entrained for Guise. From there it marched\r\nby night toward the Montdidier-Noyan front via Ly Fontaine, Guiscard,\r\nMargny aux Cerises.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It was engaged near Conchy les Pots, Orvillers, Sorel from March 29\r\nto April 8, then near Boulogne la Grasse, Mortemer, from April 10 to 26.\r\nThe division’s losses were heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE AISNE.\r\n\r\n3. After its relief it was transported to Champagne, detraining near Le\r\nChatelet sur Retourne. There it rested three weeks. It entered in line\r\nbetween Brimont and Vitry les Reims after May 20. It attacked on the\r\n27th and advanced by Merfy (29th), Tinquex (31st), as far as the line\r\nBetheny, Courcelles, St. Brice (June 2). It held that sector until the\r\n1st of August, when it retreated on La Neuvillette and held the front\r\nBetheny-Vitry road. It was relieved about September 26.\r\n\r\n4.

The latter was\r\nformed in August, 1914, with the help of the surplus trained men in the\r\ndepots (Reserve and Landwehr 1st Ban.) in the proportion of 1 battalion\r\nper active brigade. In this way it comprised 13 brigade Ersatz\r\nbattalions grouped into 3 mixed brigades (29th, 41st, and 51st).\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n1. Detraining on August 17, 1914, at Sarrebruecken, in the rear of the\r\n6th Army, elements of the 8th Ersatz Division went into action on the\r\n20th. It fought at Hoéville and Serres, north of Luneville, on the 25th\r\nand took part in the attacks upon Nancy the first part of September.\r\nSent to the rear of the front in the vicinity of Morhange, it was\r\ntransferred to Haye at the end of September to relieve the 14th Corps.\r\nIt stayed there for two years between Limey on the west and Le Pretre\r\nwood on the east.\r\n\r\n2. In August, 1915, the brigade Ersatz battalions were grouped into\r\nregiments. The 8th Ersatz Division was then composed of the 363d, 364th,\r\nand 365th Infantry Regiments (Prussian) and of the 51st and 52d Ersatz\r\nRegiments (Wurttemberg). It continued to hold the lines in Haye, south\r\nof Thiaucourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE PRETRE WOOD.\r\n\r\n1. Until the beginning of October, 1916, the 8th Ersatz Division\r\noccupied the sector of the Pretre wood, north of Fey en Haye. In August\r\nit lost the 364th Infantry Regiment, assigned to the 33d Reserve\r\nDivision, and on September 20 the 363d, which entered into the\r\ncomposition of the 214th Division. It received a new regiment, the 400th\r\nInfantry Regiment, formed in September by drafts upon its infantry\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMME.\r\n\r\n2. Leaving the 400th Infantry Regiment in Haye, and composed of three\r\nregiments (365th Infantry Regiment, 51st and 52d Ersatz Regiments), the\r\n8th Ersatz Division went to the Somme on October 3. After a rest in the\r\nvicinity of Le Catelet until the 10th it went into the sector east of\r\nsouth of Bouchavesnes, where it did not take part in any important\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORRAINE.\r\n\r\n3. Relieved on November 18, it returned to Lorraine at Fey en Haye. It\r\nwent into line southeast of Thiaucourt November 25, where the 400th\r\nInfantry Regiment was again assigned to the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. The 8th Ersatz Division remained on the Lorraine front, southeast of\r\nThiaucourt, until about May 10, 1917. In February the 400th Infantry\r\nRegiment was sent to Russia.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of May the division underwent several changes—it gave\r\nthe 365th Infantry Regiment to the 5th Landwehr Division and received\r\nthe 122d Fusileer Regiment (Wurttemberg) from the 105th Division. The\r\n51st and 52d Ersatz Regiments received the 478th and 479th. The 8th\r\nErsatz Division, already called Wurttemberg, then became the 243d\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\nAISNE.\r\n\r\n2. The reserve, first (behind the Rheims front), behind Brimont and\r\nNeufchâtel, the 243d Division then occupied the front between Miette and\r\nthe Aisne (north of Berry au Bac) from May 29 to August 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE HILL 344.\r\n\r\n3. Transferred to Verdun, the division went into action at Hill 344 on\r\nSeptember 9. The 479th Infantry Regiment lost heavily during the attack\r\nof the 9th. The 122d Infantry Regiment took part in the attack of\r\nOctober 2 and also had losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUSE (LEFT BANK).\r\n\r\n4. About October 6 the 243d Division was relieved and sent to rest near\r\nStenay. On October 17 it took up its position on the left bank of the\r\nMeuse (Bethincourt sector), where it still remained in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RECRUITING.\r\n\r\nThe division had become purely Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the 243d Division appeared good. They were never engaged\r\nin very active sectors, except at Hill 344 in September, 1917. At Verdun\r\nthey showed only mediocre combat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The division was relieved in the sector northwest of Verdun at the\r\nend of January and traveled by rail to the Stenay area north of\r\nMontfaucon, where it rested and trained until March 20. On that day it\r\nentrained at Stenay and traveled via Sedan-Charleville-Hirson-Ors to\r\nBazeul. On the 22d the division marched by night via Le Cateau and\r\nMontbrehain to Raisel, crossed the Somme at St. Christ-Briost and came\r\ninto line reenforcing the front on the night of March 25–26.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PICARDY.\r\n\r\n2. It advanced in the first line of the attack through Guillancourt,\r\nVillers aux Erables, and attacked Moreuil on the 30th. It suffered very\r\nheavy losses, amounting to 50 per cent between March 26–30 at Estrees\r\nand Ignancourt, and in the attack on Moreuil. Two companies of the 122d\r\nFusileer Regiment lost more than 207 of their fighting strength. The\r\ndivision was withdrawn about April 4. On April 2 the division received a\r\ndraft of 350 to 400 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICARDY.\r\n\r\n3. The division was reengaged north and east of Villers Bretonneux,\r\nrelieving the 228th Division. On the 24th it made an unsuccessful attack\r\non Villers Bretonneux. On the 27th it was withdrawn to close reserve and\r\nrested until May 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n4. Between May 13 and July 7 the division was in line near Albert. It\r\nrested until August 10, when it was engaged east of Morlancourt, north\r\nof the Somme. It was forced back by Chuignolles, Proyart, Fouconcourt,\r\nFay, Dompierre until its relief on August 29. Four hundred prisoners\r\nwere lost in that engagement.

The 255th Division is the former Metz Detachment, the composition of\r\nwhich was remodeled and which was changed into a division in May, 1917.\r\n\r\n2. The Metz Detachment, composed of the 31st Landwehr Brigade (30th and\r\n68th Landwehr Regiments) and of the 1st, 2d, and 3d Ersatz Landwehr\r\nRegiments, occupied the same sector of Lorraine between the Moselle and\r\nAbaucourt (north of Pont à Mousson) from the end of October, 1914, to\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1917.\r\n\r\n1. About May, 1917, the Metz Detachment became the 255th Division. It\r\nthen comprised the 31st Landwehr Brigade (30th and 68th Landwehr\r\nRegiments) and three regiments of recent organization, the 86th, 94th,\r\nand 153d Landwehr, formed by grouping the battalions of the old\r\ndissolved Ersatz regiments.\r\n\r\n2. With this composition, the 255th Division continued to hold the front\r\nalong the Moselle (right bank) until the month of October.\r\n\r\n3. In July and August the 30th and 86th Landwehr Regiments left the\r\n255th Division to form the new 31st Independent Landwehr Brigade. The\r\nlatter remained in line on the right bank of the Moselle. The 255th\r\nDivision, reduced to three regiments (68th, 94th, and 153d Landwehr),\r\nwent to the left bank (Le Prêtre wood) about October 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1917 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nMediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1.

At that time the company strength\r\nwas 180 to 200, with an effective rifle strength of 100. The men were\r\nmostly between 37 and 45 years of age.\r\n\r\n2.

The 302d Division (former Hippel Division) was organized on the\r\nMacedonian front toward the end of 1916. At the beginning it included\r\nelements of various nationalities. It appears to have become entirely\r\nGerman during the first part of 1917. At this time its composition was\r\nas follows: The staff of the 22d Infantry Brigade (coming from the 11th\r\nDivision); the 42d Infantry Regiment from the 3d Division; the 45th\r\nInfantry Regiment from the 101st Division and the 10th Jäger Regiment\r\n(the latter formed by grouping the Jäger and Fusileer Battalions of the\r\nGuard and the 9th and 12th Jäger Battalions). In January, 1917, the 45th\r\nInfantry Regiment had replaced the 11th Grenadier Regiment, transferred\r\nto the 101st Division and which had come to the Hippel Division in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n2. The elements of the 302d Division occupied the Macedonian front\r\n(Monastir-Boucle de la Cerna) in 1917 and until the end of February,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n3. In June, 1917, the 42d Infantry Regiment, the same as the 59th\r\nRegiment of the 101st Division, left the Macedonian front for Roumania\r\n(vicinity of Rimnicu-Sarat). It was definitely detached from the 302d\r\nDivision and replaced by the 21st Reserve Infantry Regiment from the\r\n216th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1918.\r\n\r\n1. The divisional staff operated in Macedonia until it surrendered as a\r\ncomplete unit, divisional commander, staff, and troops, numbering 7,000,\r\nabout the 1st of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VALUE—1918 ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe division was rated as third class at the time of its retirement from\r\nthe Western Front.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
